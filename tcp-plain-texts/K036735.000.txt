induced me to endeavour at his cure  Mer  False prevaricating Urganda Love was your inducement Have you not stolen the prince from his royal father and detained him here by your power while a hundred knights are in search after himDoes not every thing about you prove the consequence of your want of honour and faith to me Were you not plac'd on this happy spot of Arcadia to be the guardian of its peace and innocence and have not the Arcadians liv'd for ages the envy of less happy because less virtuous people  Urg  Let me beseech you Merlin spare my shame  Mer  And are they not at last by your

have been vex'd at it to be sure but how can you help yourself  st Shep  I have not thought of that I only feel I can't bear it and as to the  won't  I must trust in a little mischief of my own to bring it aboutO that I had the power of our enchantress yonder I wou'd play the devil with them all  d Shep  And yet folks say she has no power in lovematters you know notwithstanding her charms and her spirits she is in love with a fool and has not wit enough to make him return it  st Shep  No matter for that if I could not make folks love me I would make them miserable and that's the next pleasure to it  d Shep  And yet to do justice to to her who makes all this disturbance among you she does not in the least encourage the Shepherds and she can't help their falling in love with her  st Shep  May be so nor can I help hating and detesting her because they do fall in love with herSylvia's good qualities cannot excuse her to me my quarrel to her is that all the young fellows follow her not because she does not follow the young fellows  d Shep  Well but really now sister 'tis a little hard that a girl who has beauty to get lovers or merit enough to keep 'em should be hated for her good qualities  Affectedly  st Shep  Marry come up my insulting sister because you think your shepherd constant you have no feeling for the falseheartedness of mineBut don't be too vain with your success my Dorilas is made of the same stuff as your Damon and I can't for the life of me see that you have any particular security for your fool more than I had for mine  d Shep  Why are you so angry

Nothing is too farshe makes me suffer ten thousand deaths and nothing but her's can appease me    Dorus  going  Stay DorusI have a richer revenge she shall be shut up in the Black Tower 'till her beauties are destroy'd and then I will present her to this ungrateful CymonLet her be brought before me and I will feast my eyes and ease my heart with this devoted SylviaNo reply but obey  Dor  It is doneThis is going too far  Aside  Exit shrugging up his shoulders  Urg  Tho' still of raging winds the sport  My shipwreck'd heart shall gain the port  Revenge the pilot steers her way  No more of

the rival of Urganda  Syl  I am no wretch but the happy maid who am possess'd of the affections of Cymon and with them I have nothing to hope or fear  Urg  Thou vain rash creatureI will make thee fear my power and hope for my Mercy  Waves her wand and the scene changes to the black rocks  Syl  I am still unmov'd  Smiling  Urg  Thou art on the very brink of perdition and in a moment wilt be closed

Cymon  's cure shall be  Urganda  's wound    Urganda  waves her wand  Mer  Ha ha hahyour power is gone  Urg  I am all terror and shamein vain I wave this wandI feel my power is gone yet I still retain my passionsMy misery is complete  Mer  It is indeed No power no happiness were superior to thine till you sunk them in your follyyou now find but too late that there is no magic like virtue  Sound of warlike instruments  Urg  What mean those sounds of joymy heart forbodes that they proclaim my fall and dishonour  Mer  The orders of chivalry are assembled sent by Cymon's father to celebrate and protect the marriage of Cymon with Sylvia  Urg  Death to my hopesthen I am lost indeed  Mer  From the moment you wrong'd me and yourself I became their protectorI counteracted all your schemes I continued Cymon in his state of ignorance till he was cured by Sylvia whom I conveyed here for that purpose that shepherdess is a princess equal to CymonThey have obtained by their virtues the throne of Arcadia which you have lost byBut I have done I see your repentance and my anger melts into pity  Urg  Pity me notI am undeserving of itI have been cruel and faithless and ought to be wretchedThus I destroy the small remains of my sovereignty  Breaks her wand  May power basely exerted be ever thus broken and dispersed  Throws away her wand  Forgive my errors and forget my name  O drive me hence with peniTence and shame  From Merlin Cymon Sylvia let me fly  Beholding them my shame can never die  Exit  Urganda  Mer  Falsehood is punished virtue rewarded and Arcadia is restored

Warmly to wish before our piece you view  A happy yearto youyouyouand you  BoxesPit Gall Gall  From you the play'rs enjoy and feel it here  The  merry Christmas  and the  happy year  There is a good old sayingpray attend it  As you begin the year you'll surely end it  Should any one this night incline to evil  He'll play for twelve long months the very devil  Should any married dame exert her tongue  She'll sing the  Zodiac  round the same sweet song  And should the husband join  his  music too  Why then 'tis  cat  and  dog  the whole year thro'  Ye sons of  law  and  physic  for your ease  Besure this day you never take your fees  Can't you refusethen the disease grows strong  You'll have two itching palmsLord knows how long  Writers of news by this strange fate are bound  They fib to day and fib the whole year round  You wits assembled here both great and small  Set not this night afloatyour critic gall  If you should snarl and not incline to laughter  What sweet companions for a twelvemonth after  You must he muzzled for this night at least  Our author has a right this day to feast  He has not touch'd one bit as yetRemember  'Tis a long  fast  from now to next December  'Tis  holiday  you are  our patrons  now  to the upper gallery  If you but grin the critics wont  bow    wow  As for the plot wit humour languageI  Beg you such trisles kindly to pass by  The most essential part which something means  As dresses dances sinkings flyings scenes  They'll make you stare nay there is such a thing  Will make you starestill more▪for I must sing  And should your taste and ears be over nice  Alas you'll spoil my finging in a trice  If you should  growl  my notes will alter soon  I can't be  in  if you are  out  of tune  Permit my fears your favour to bespeak  My part's a strong one and  poor I but weak  alluding to his late accident  If you but smile I'm firm if frown I stumble  Scarce well of  one  spare me a  second  tumble  EPILOGUE  Written by  GEORGE KEATE    Esq  Spoken by Mrs ABINGTON  Enter peeping in at the stagedoor  IS the stage clearbless meI've such a dread  It seems enchanted ground where'er I tread  Coming forward  What noise was thathush'twas a false alarm  I'm sure there's no one here will do me harm  Amongst you can't be found a single knight  Who would not do an injur'd damsel right  Wellheav'n be prais'd I'm out of magic reach  And have once more regain'd the pow'r of speech  Aye and I'll use itfor it must appear  That my poor tongue is greatly in arrear  There's not a female here but shar'd my woe  Ty'd down to YES or still more hateful NO  No is expressivebut I must confess  If rightly question'd I'd use only YES  In MERLIN's walk this broken wand I found  Shewing a broken wand  Which to  two words  my speaking organs bound  Suppose upon the town I try his spell  Ladies don't stirYou use your tongues too well  How tranquil ev'ry place when by my skill  FOLLY is mute and even SLANDER still  Old gossips speechless  bloods  would breed no riot  And all the tongues at JONATHAN's lie quiet  Each  grave profession  must new bush the wig  Nothing to say 'twere needful they look big  The  reverend doctor  might the change endure  He would sit still and have his  sine cure  Nor could  great folks  much hardship undergo  They do their business with an AYE or NO  But come I only jok'ddismiss your fear  Tho' I've the pow'r I will not use it here  I'll only keep my magic as a guard  To awe each critic who attacks our bard  I see some malecontents their singers biting  Snarling " The ancients never knew such writing  " The drama's lostthe managers exhaust us  " With  opera's    monkies    mab  and  Dr Faustus  "  Dread Sirs a wordthe public taste is fickle  All palates in their turn we strive to tickle  Our cat'rers  vary  and you'll own at least  It is  variety  that makes the feast  If this fair circle smileand the  gods  thunder  I with this wand will heep the critics under  FINIS
