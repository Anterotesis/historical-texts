 REMARKS CRITICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE ON THE TEXT AND NOTES OF THE LAST EDITION OF SHAKSPEARE  Ah think not Mistress more true Dulness lies  In Follys Cap than Wisdoms grave disguise  Like buoys that never sink into the flood  On Learnings surface we but lie and nod  For thee we dim the eyes and stuff the head  With all such reading as was never read  For thee explain a thing till all men doubt it  And write about it Goddess and about it  DUNCIAD  LONDON PRINTED FOR J JOHNSON IN ST PAULS CHURCHYARD MDCCLXXXIII  PREFACE  IF a variety of editions and innumerable comments can be supposed to perfect and correct the inaccurate text of a celebrated author sufficient one would think has been done to leave that of Shakspeare without a blemish So slow however or so inefficacious is the progress and exertion of verbal criticism when moiling in the dust and cobwebs of antiquity so much is to be demolished so much to be rebuilt that it will not except to those who place implicit confidence in the interested and unqualifyed assertions of every publisher be a matter of much surprise to learn that after all that has been done by the labour of Shakspeares numerous editors and commentatorsafter all that has been urged or assumed in favour of the last  edition as much more still remains to be done to bring his text back even to the state of correctness in which it was left by his first editors A reader of hesitation and reflection will hear this with perfect calmness he will be no stranger to the fluctuating state of former editions he will have noticed the boldness and assurance the legislative and dictatorial manner in which every succeeding editor has ushered hisself into the world and will not easyly forget the confidence of each in assuring the public that nothing further could possibly be done to his authorIs not this the language of Rowe and Pope and Theobald and Warburton and Hanmer and Capell And where are they now Where even dr Johnson and mr Steevens may in the course of a few revolving years be sent to accompany themthe regions of oblivion or disgrace  The chief and fundamental business of an editor is carefully to collate the original and authentic editions of his author It is otherwise impossible for him to be certain that he is giving the genuine text because he does not know what that text is There have been no less than eight professed editors of Shakspeare and  yet the old copies of which we have heard so much have never been collated by any one of them no not even either of the two first folios books indifferently common and quoted by every body And yet strange as it may seem not one of the eight but has taken the credit of or actually asserted his having collated them One may be well allowed to pass by the pretensions of those prior to dr Johnson without particular notice their falsehood is sufficiently apparent in the margin of the late edition Surely men who thus proudly expose and severely reprobate the crimes of their neighbours should effectually guard theirselves against similar accusations  "I" says dr Johnson "collated such copies as I could procure and wished for more  Preface p  " "I collated all the folios at the beginning but afterwards used only the first  Ibidem p  " He must be very hardy indeed that dares give a flat contradiction to such positive assertions as these from so respectable a character But the cause of Shakspeare and truth obliges one to say that the learned writer is certainly mistaken The text of his own edition  the notes of mr Steevens and in some respect the remarks in the following sheets will prove that he never collated any one of the folios no not for a single play or at least that of his collations he has made little or no use That he picked out a reading here and there from the old editions is true all his predecessors did the same but this is not  collation  So much for dr Johnson  With regard to the last edition mr Steevens explicitly tells us that "it has been constantly compared with the most authentic copies whether collation was absolutely necessary to the sense or not  Advertisement p  " "Would not any one from this declaration" to use the ingenious critics own words "suppose that he had at least  compared  the  folios  with each other  Ibidem p  " But he has been deceived no doubt by the person employed in this laborious but necessary work What an abuse of that confidence and credit which the public naturally place in an editor of rank and character to tell them that "by a diligent collation of all the old copies hitherto discovered and the judicious restoration  of ancient readings the text of this author seems now finally settled  Malones preface to his Supplement  " To what better cause can we ascribe such unfounded assertions than to indolence and temerity since had the ingenious writer compared the old and present editions through a single play he must necessaryly have perceived that all the old copies had NOT been diligently collated that ancient readings had NOT been judiciously restored and that the text is no more finally settled at present than it was in the time of Theobald Hanmer and Warburton nay that it is at large in the same state of inaccuracy and corruption in which it was left by mr Rowe  These it may be objected are merely negative and unproved assertions It is very true And they who do not think them confirmed in the course of the following pages and will not give theirselves the trouble to investigate their truth are at liberty to disbelieve them To publish the various readings of the old editions would be a busyness of some labour and little utility  As to the notes and conjectures here offered to the public very little need be said Shakspeare is  the God of the writers idolatry  and should any one of these remarks be thought pertinent or useful in the opinion of a single individual who like him admires the effusions of this darling child of nature and fancy whom  age cannot wither  and whose  infinite variety custom cannot stale  it will be a sufficient gratification to him for the pains bestowed in drawing them up And if there should be a future edition of this favourite this inimitable author the writer is not without vanity to hope that the following sheets may stimulate the editors care and attention to give his text with integrity judgement and correctness  a consummation  Devoutly to be wish'd  and which must of consequence follow to reduce the number of exuberant and impertinent notes  From a republication of the last edition nothing is to be expected The work will continue like the editions of Warburton and Hanmer to dishonour crit  c  s  and to insult Shakspeare    The freedom with which every editor has treated his predecessors precludes the necessity  of an apology for the liberties taken in the ensuing pages with the sentiments of some of our most eminent literary characters The superiority of a commentators rank however does not intitle his blunders to respect It were to be wished that dr Johnson had shewn somewhat less partiality to  pride of place  for though he professes to have treated his predecessors with candour Theobald the best of Shakspeares editors experiences as much scurrility and injustice at his hands as Hanmer and Warburton the worst of them do deference and respect For this however the learned critic might have his private reasons which as they could scarcely have justifyed his conduct he did right to conceal  To controvert the opinions or disprove the assertions of mr Steevens dr Farmer and mr Tyrwhitt men no less remarkable for their learning and genius than for their obliging dispositions and amiable manners has been a painful and odious task But whereever the writer has been under the necessity of differing from any of these gentlemen either in point of opinion or in point of fact he will not be  found to have expressed hisself in a manner inconsistent with a due sense of obligations and the profoundest respect Such at least was his intention such has been his endeavour and such is his hope  ERRATA  P l  for  might  read  might have  P l  dele  it

LAST EDITION OF SHAKSPEARE  VOLUME THE FIRST  PROLEGOMENA  p  SHAKSPEARES WILL  The slightest alteration in the name of this great writer is a circumstance of so much importance to the public that although the editors may not have been too hasty in preferring SHAKSPEARE to SHAKESPEARE it might be wished that a more decisive and less equivocal authority than his WILL had been produced to justify and enforce the change This will it should seem the poet made in his last sickness when he appears to have been so incapable of paying that attention to the writing of his name which a man in health usually does that he has actually subscribed it two different ways SHAKSPERE and SHAKSPEARE So that we are still uncertain which mode to adopt How negligent therefor have the editors been and how much are they to be blamed for not procuring better and more positive evidence if it were to be come at  it certainly was Mr Garrick as they must have known though they did not think it necessary to notice the fact had then in his possession a lease or mortgage from Shakspeare of a house in Blackfriars subscribed as we learn from mr Colmans preface to Beaumont and Fletcher with his own hand WM SHAKSPEARE which very luckyly confirms the alteration made with less authority by the present editors This deed was discovered among some old writings by mr Wallis of Norfolkstreet who presented it to mr Garrick in the possession of whose widow it most probably still remains Mr Colman likewise informs us that the name is in the poets own county pronounced with the first  a  short  This pronunciation is right Twice in the body of his will and once in the marginthat is except the signatures whereever his name occurs it is written SHACKSPEARE and the instrument itself is by two different indorsements called MR SHACKSPERES will  and in the register of Stratford church uniformly entered SHAKSPERE  p  ATTEMPT TO ASCERTAIN THE ORDER IN WHICH THE PLAYS OF SHAKSPEARE WERE WRITTEN BY MR MALONE  One  Hamlet  or  Hamnet  Sadler being a witness to and mentioned in Shakspeares will mr Malone takes it for granted that he acquired this name from the testators tragedy of Hamlet and thence infers at least gives it as one reason that the play must have been written in that he might be of what the critic thinks a competent age for a witness In fact however the name of  Hamlet  was in common use long before Shakspeare was able to write a line so that the gentlemans presumption must in this instance necessaryly fall to the ground  "Here under lyeth buried Eleanor Wife of HAMLET Clarke She dyed on Sunday the th of January  After they had been married years and about two months" Stows Survey by Strype I iii  p  Whenever the  Merry Wives of Windsor  may have been written it is certain as well from the enquirers quotations and remarks as from the play its self that the time of action is in the reign of king Henry the fourth But "if it should be placed" says he "as dr Johnson observes it should be read between the  Second part of K Henry IV  and  Henry V  " where however it cannot be introduced without the most flagrant impropriety "it must be remembered that mrs Quickly who is halfbawd halfhostess in  K Henry IV  is in the  Merry Wives of Windsor  Dr Caius's housekeeper and makes a decent appearance and in  K Henry V  is Pistols wife and dies in an hospital a progression that is not very natural" It is strange enough that the critic should not perceive that  Dr Caiuses housekeeper  and  the landlady of the Boarshead  are totally distinct characters and have not if we except their name sex sentiments and loquacity a single circumstance in common between them Shakspeare could have been at no loss for one of the same name and family in any town in England  TEMPEST  p  Boats  If you can command these elements to silence we will not  handle  a rope more  This is a very early though not the most favourable specimen of the integrity and correctness of the present text Both the folios read"we will not  hand  a rope more"  which is evidently right that being the proper seaterm in use at this day  p  Mira  More to know  Did never  meddle  with my thoughts  To  meddle  says mr Steevens in this instance signifies to  mingle  Hence adds he the substantive  medley  But it should rather mean to  interfere  to  trouble  to  busy its self  as still used in the North  e g  Don't  meddle with me  i e Let me alone Don't molest me  Medley  can scarce be formed of  meddle  it is most likely a corruption of the French word  mesleé  p  Pro  being transported  And  wrapp'd  in secret studies  And could this bald and threadbare phrase have passed the examination of judicial collaters and correctors of Shakspeares text Would not  rapt  have been a fair and probable conjecture even if it had  not  been  as it is  the reading of the old editions And could it possibly have escaped the observation of any person who had made a  constant comparison with the most authentic copies  p  Pro    urchins  Shall for that vast of night that they may work  All exercise on thee  Spirits  perhaps  in the shape of  urchins or  hedgehogs  which as Caliban elsewhere complains would sometimes  Lie tumbling in 'his' barefoot way and mount  Their prickles at 'his' foot fall  In the  Merry Wives of Windsor  however it seems to imply a spirit or fairy of a peculiar appearance  Nan Page my daughter and my little son  And three or four more of their growth we'll dress  Like  urchins  ouphes and fairies green and white  With rounds of waxen tapers on their  heads  And rattles in their  bands  p  Pro  when thou didst not savage  Know thy own meaning but wouldst gabble like  A thing  more brutish  More brutish  than what The old edition reads"a thing  most brutish  " and so should this as the quotation to dr Warburtons note might have led the editors to suspect  p  Mira  Make not too rash a trial of him for  He's  gentle  and  not fearful  That is

 mettle  p  Ste  If I can recover him and keep him tame I will not take  too much  for him he shall pay for him that hath him and that soundly  Too much  says mr Steevens means  any sum ever so much  But this can hardly be right Stephano evidently proposes to sell his monster for a good round price which it would have been rather difficult for him to do if he were determined  not to take  any sum ever so much  for it He means that he could not rate his purchase too highLet me says he get ever so much for him it shall not be more than enough  p  Cal  Nor scrape  trencher  The old copy mr Steevens observes reads  trenchering  and one might naturally have expected a reason why this did not as the word is certainly not so very improper  Housing  is one of the same kind Rightly  trencheren housen  trenchers houses The participle  beholden  is by a similar mistake every where in the old editions  beholding  p  S    Lead monster we'll followI would I could see this laborer he lays it on  Trin  Wilt come I'll follow Stephano  Is it not evident that the words  Wilt come  should be the last of the preceding speech  TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA  p  Pro  Oh how this spring of love  resembleth  The uncertain glory of an April day  Which now shews all the beauty of the sun  And by and by a cloud takes all away  Resembleth  mr Tyrwhitt says is here used as a quadrisyllable as if it was written  resembeleth  And in support of this assertion he instances the two following lines the one from the  Comedy of Errors  the other from  As you like it  And these two Dromios one in  semblance  The parts and graces of the  wrestler  "And it should be observed" continues he "that Shakespeare takes the same liberty with many other words in  which  l  or  r  are is subjoined to another consonant See  Com of Errors  "These are the parents to these  children  "  Mr Steevens in a note immediately preceding mr Tyrwhitts has observed that when a word was not long enough to complete the measure our early writers occasionally extended it Thus says he Spenser in his  Faery Queen  "Formerly grounded and fast  setteled  "  Again  "The while sweet Zephirus loud  whisteled  "His treble a strange kind of harmony  "Which Guyon's senses softly  tickeled  " c  From this practice he supposes the author wrote  resembeleth  which though it affords no jingle completes the verse "The old ballad of  Titus Andronicus  " adds he "is written in this measure where the  second  and  fourth  lines  only  rhime" Whether this be a fact or not "let the forest judge" The ballad is printed by Percy and begins thus the stanza being the same throughout  You noble minds and famous martiall wights  That in defence of native country fights  Give eare to me that ten yeeres fought for Rome  Yet reapt disgrace at my returning home  There is much greater and more important matter i  these observations than either of the ingenious commentators was aware of Neither Shakspeare nor Spenser appears from the above instances at least to have taken the smallest liberty in extending his words neither has the incident of  l  or  r  being subjoined to another consonant any thing to do in the matter But that great authors and great critics should not be better acquainted with the orthography and grammatical structure of their native tongue is a circumstance which if not to be wondered at is surely very much  to be regretted The truth is that  every  verb in the English language gains an  additional syllable  by its termination in  est eth ed ing  or when formed into a substantive in  er  and the above words when rightly printed are not onely unexceptionable but most just Thus  resemble  makes  resembleeth wrestle wrestleer  and  settle whistle tickle  make  settleed whistleed tickleed  Semblance  indeed cannot properly be written as three syllables neither perhaps is it altogether necessary to pronounce it so  Childeren  however would be certainly right  Another instance of this sort occurs in  K John  That were  embatteled  and rank'd in Kent  which should now be written  embattleed  though the verb was probably enough in Shakspeares time usually spelled  embattel  Again in Butlers panegyric on sir John Denham  No poet jeer'd for  scribbling  amiss  With verses forty times more lewd than his  Here  scribbling  should be printed  scribbleing  the metre evidently requiring three syllables which are necessaryly articulated in the pronunciation  These ideas had they been more germane to the object of the present sheets or more likely to experience a favorable reception might have been much expanded and further pursued but indeed our orthographical system is so thoroughly corrupted and the principles and formation of the language are even by those who have professedly treated the subject  Johnson Priestley  c  so little investigated or understood that a writer hardy enough to attempt a reform will naturally expect to find many of his clearest axioms considered as the offspring of singularity affectation and caprice  p  Launce  I am the dogno the dog is himself and I am the dogoh the dog is me and I am myself ay so so  This passage dr Johnson very gravely remarks is much confused and of confusion says he the present reading makes no end There is not however the least room for alteration Shakspeare has evidently intended to make honest Launce puzzle and confound hisself in the arrangement of his  dramatis personae  and it should seem he has tolerably well succeeded  A similar thought mr Steevens observes occurs in a play of an  elder  date than this  A Christian turn'd Turk  The  Two Gentlemen of Verona  is mentioned by Meres in and in the opinion of mr Malone "bears strong internal marks of an early composition" He therefor refers it to the year Surely then the play quoted by mr Steevens can hardly be supposed to be of an elder date  Ibi  Launce  Now come I to my motheroh that she could speak now like a wood woman  Mr Steevens was not certain that he understood this passage and indeed the contrary does not appear by his explanation of it Now says Launce I come to my mother  i e  to  the old shoe with the hole in it  which he has just told us was to represent her oh that she  i e  the old shoe could now speak like a wood woman that is like a woman craz'd mad out of her senses with grief for my departure And where's the difficulty of this  p  Pro  Is it mine eye or Valentino's praise  The word  eye  was supplyed by dr Warburton who says that in ALL the old editions we find the line printed thus  It is mine or Valentino's praise  But this to use his own "warm language  See dr Johnsons Prefaces Life of Broome small edition p  " is a lye  The line is so printed in NO old edition  The first folio reads  It is mine or Valentines praise  The second  Is it mine then or Valentineans praise  There is no quarto  p  Jul  Out out  Lucetta that will be illfavour'd  Out out  Lucetta means no more than  fie fie  p    Out  Know then that some of us are gentlemen  Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth  Thrust from the company of  awful men  That is says dr Johnson  reverend worshipful  such as  magistrates  c Sir John Hawkins proposes  lawful  which mr Steevens and mr Tyrwhitt seem halfinclined to admit But  awful men  is certainly right and means  men wellgoverned observant of law and authority full of or subject to awe  In the same kind of sense as we use  fearful  p    Out  Myself was from Verona banished  For practising to steal away a lady  An heir and  niece  ally'd unto the duke  Niece  mr Theobald altered to  near  as the poet he thought "would never have expressed himself so stupidly as to tell us this lady was the duke's  niece  and  allied  to him" And indeed if he had done so the remark and alteration might have been just but he does not say she was the  dukes niece  any more than he does that she was  his  heir  She was the  niece  and  heir  of some body else and a distant relation of the duke  p  Sil  I am very loath to be your idol sir  But since your falshood shall become you well  To worship shadows and adore false shapes  Send to me in the morning and I'll send it  Dr Johnson says that this is hardly sense He might have said more It is nonsense We might he thinks read thus  But since  you're false  it shall become you well  Mr Tyrwhitt however will have no alteration he supposes the word  it  to be understood  i e  But since your falsehood  it  shall become you well  c  Or that  To worship shadows  c is the nominative case to  shall become  How far any of these opposite conjectures would rectify or elucidate the text it is not now proposed to examine as the omission of a single comma will restore sense to the whole passage  I am very loth says Silvia to be your idol but since your falsehood to your friend and mistress shall well become you to worship shadows and adore false shapes  i e  will be properly employed in so doing send to me and you shall have my picture  Ibi  Host  By my  hallidom  I was fast sleep  i e  By my  holydame  our lady  p  Jul  It seems you lov'd not her to  leave her taken  Protheus says dr Johnson does not properly  leave  his ladys token he  gives it away  he therefor proposes a  different reading But what puerile quibbling this is To leave is to  quit abandon forsake  part with  c  To  leave her taken  is properly to  give it away  MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR  Shal  The council shall know this  Fal  'Twere better for you if 'twere known in council you'll be laughed at  Dr Johnson considers this as a broken and abrupt speech and alters the passage accordingly Mr Steevens says the modern editors read  if 'twere  not  known in council  and believes Falstaff quibbles between  council  and  counsel  secrecy But the present reading is just neither is there any such conceit in the speech which is quite in Falstaffs insolent sneering manner It would be much better for you indeed says he to have it known in the council where you would onely be laugh'd at  p  Slen  Two  Edward shovelboards  that cost me two shillings and twopence apiece  "  Edward shovelboards  " dr Farmer thinks "were the  broad s  illings  of  Edw VI  " But why  Edward the Sixths shillings  for the  shovel boards  of  Henry the Fourths time  Can it be imagined that these shillings in Shakspeares time not fifty years after their coinage and when they were in common circulation could be possibly ever sold for two and twopence It may likewise be doubted if Edward the Sixths shillings ever were or indeed could be used at sho  el board as they appear much too light for that diversion M  ster Slenders "Edward shovelboards" have undoubtedly been broad shillings of  Edward the Third  Ibi  Sim  I combat challenge of this  latten bilbo  One could well wish that the greater part of the long notes on this passage had been omitted  Latten  is certainly  tin  But whether the allusion be to Slenders  softness  rather than to his  thinness  is not quite so clear  p  Fal  Hold firrah bear you these letters  tightly  This is nonsense The quarto and second folio read  rightly  for which  tightly  the reading of the first folio is onely a misprint  p  Sim  No forsooth he hath but a  little wee face  Wee  says mr Steevens in the northern dialect signifies  very little  But though he is so  near  the true meaning he hints that on the authority of the quarto we might be led to read  whey face Little wee  however is certainly the right reading it implies something extremely diminutive and is a very common vulgar idiom in the North  Wee  alone has only the signification of  little  Thus Cleveland  A Yorkshire  wee bit  longer than a mile  The proverb is  A mile and a  wee bit  i e  about a  league and a half  p  Quic  We shall all be  shent  i e  according to Mr Steevens  scolded roughly treated  The word has indeed a variety of significations in old authors and these are two of them but in modern language mrs Quicklys exclamation would have been  We shall be all  murder'd ruin'd undone  p  Pist  Hope is a  curtail'd dog  in some affairs  The tail says dr Johnson is counted necessary to the agility of a greyhound and one method he observes of disqualifying a dog according to the forestlaws is was to cut his tail and make him a  curtail  A  curtaildog  adds mr Steevens was the dog of an unqualifyed person whose tail by the  laws of the forest  was  cut off  But it does not appear that there either is or could be any such regulation in the  Forestlaws  as  greyhounds  which alone would be disqualifyed by  excauditation  could never have been the objects of laws made solely for the preservation of the kings deer By those  modern forestlaws  however the  acts of parliament for the preservation    i e  destruction  of the Game  as expounded by that learned and respectable body ycleped  Justices of the Peace  an  unqualifyed  person is allowed to keep a  curtailed greyhound  without incurring the penalties of the aforesaid statutes in which it is difficult to say whether Justice or Humanity be most apparent A  curtail dog  simply is one of that inferior species of those animals now called  curs  from the prevailing usage of cutting their tails A piece of wanton barbarity which though by no means singular even in  this  country can onely be perpetrated by unfeeling wretches who seem to enjoy no more reason than is just sufficient to plunge them into a more degraded and brutal state than that of the poor animal they so inhumanly mangle  p  Quic  But Mrs Page would desire you to send her your little page  of all loves  This which mr Steevens thinks signifies no more than  by all means  is an expression of kindness and an earnest desire  that the person would comply with the request out of affection and regard  p  Fal  I see what thou wert if  Fortune thy foe  were not  He alludes to a very old and formerly very popular song beginning  Fortune my foe why dost thou frown on me  It is more than once mentioned by Beaumont and Fletcher and from a passage in  The Rump or Mirrour of the Times  an old comedy by John Tatham it should seem to have been a common dance tune which may serve to shew that the old dances were much more grave and solemn than those now in use the tune being a very slow movement as the reader will immediately recollect when he is informed that it is the identical air now known by the song of  Death and the Lady  to which the metrical lamentations of extraordinary criminals have been usually chanted for upwards of these two hundred years  p  Mrs Ford  It is my maids aunt of Brentford  Ford  A witch a quean  c  she works by charms  c  Concerning some  old woman of Brentford  says mr Steevens there  are several ballads  among  the rest Julian of Brentfords last will and testament  The learned commentator has in this assertion perhaps been misled by the vague expression of the stationers book  Iyl of breyntfords testament  to which he seems to allude was written by Robert and printed by William Copland long before But this the only publication it is believed concerning the above lady at present known is certainly  no ballad  p  Sim  May I be so bold to say so sir  Fal  Ay sir Tike  like  who more bold  "In the first edition the latter speech stands  I Tike who more holde  And should plainly be read here  Ay sir Tike  c FARMER"  The word recommended by this ingenious critic is indeed inserted but doubtless by the printers oversight the corrupt one which it was intended to supplant has been likewise continued  p  Eva  But stay I smell a man of  middle earth  Spirits  says dr Johnson are supposed to inhabit the  ethereal regions  and  fairies  to dwell  underground men  therefor are in a  middle station  Yes but to make the explanation consistent we must suppose  spirits  to inhabit a  higher earth  and  fairies  a  lower  otherwise the station of man cannot with respect to  them  be called  middle earth  The truth is that the phrase which is a very common one signifies neither more nor less than the  earth  or  world  from its imaginary situation in the  midst  or  middle  of the Ptolemaic system and has not the least reference to either spirits or fairies  VOLUME THE SECOND  MEASURE FOR MEASURE  p  Enter Clown  As this is the first  clown  who makes his appearance in the plays of our author mr Steevens thought it not amiss from a passage in  Tarltons News out of Purgatory  to point out one of the ancient dresses appropriated to the character  I saw one actired in russet with a buttoned cap on his head a great bag by his side and a strong bat in his hand so artificially attired for a  clowne  as I began to call Tarlton's wonted shape to remembrance  This may probably enough have been the dress appropriated to such a character as the  clown  or  fool  in  As you like it All's Well that Ends Well Twelfth Night  and  King Lear  but the clown of this play is a different personage the tapster to a bawdyhouse and resembles the above character no more than  Launce Speed Costard  or  Launclot Gobbo  the note and quotation therefor which might had their use elsewhere are here certainly misplaced  p  Claud  Upon a true contract  I got possession of Juliettas bed  You know the lady  c  This speech as mr Steevens well observes is too indelicate to be spoken concerning Juliet before her face for she appears to be brought in with the rest though she has nothing to say The clown points her out as they enter and yet from Claudios telling Lucio  that he knows the lady  c one would think he says she was not meant to have made her personal appearance upon the stage  That Julietta enters at the same time with Claudio that she is not present during his conversation with Lucio and that she is afterwards in the custody of the provostare evident and certain The little seeming impropriety there is will be entirely removed by supposing that when Claudio stops to speak to Lucio the provosts officers depart with Julietta  p  Duke  We have strict statutes and most biting laws  Which for these  nineteen years  we have let sleep  It was  fourteen years  in all the editions prior to Theobald who made the alteration The reason of which he in his note upon the place says will be obvious to him who recollects what the duke has said in a foregoing scene But the  duke  had not before uttered a syllable about the matter he must therefor mean  Claudio  who mentions  the enrolled penalties  Which have like unscour'd armour hung by the wall  So long that  nineteen zodiacks  have gone round  And none of them been worn  Theobald says the author could not so disagree with himself and that it is necessary to make the two accounts correspond But there is no reason to charge the author with inconsistency neither is it necessary that the two speakers should agree in their calculation If it were the dukes account should most certainly be preferred as he was doubtless much better acquainted with the exact time of the disuse of those laws than Claudio can be reasonably supposed to have been For though he may not be too young a man to have a perfect recollection of the circumstance and it should rather appear he is yet it must be observed that he is  about to suffer  by the  revival  of  these very penalties  which both his interest and inclination would naturally lead him to represent as much more obsolete than they actually were The old reading should in all events be restored  p  Isab  Sir make me not  your story  i e  do not make a  jest of me  Dr Johnson  do not by deceiving me make me subject for a tale  Mr Steevens  do  not divert yourself with me as you would with a story do not make me the subject of your drama  p  Elb  Escal  Which is the wiser here  Justice or iniquity  These says dr Johnson were I suppose two personages well known to the audience by their frequent appearance in the old moralities The words therefor continues he at that time produced a combination of ideas which they have now lost  Justice  or  iniquity  i e the  constable  or the  fool  Escalus calls the latter  iniquity  in allusion to the old  Vice  a necessary character it is said in the ancient moralities or dumb shews and the  Harlequin  of the modern stage  Justice  may have a similar allusion to his supposed antagonist into whose hands after a variety of elusions he was always made to fall  p  Enter Lucio and Isabella  Prov  Save your honour  Ang  Stay yet awhile  To Isab  you are welcome what's your will  It is not clear dr Johnson thinks why the provost is bidden to stay nor when he goes out  The entrance of Lucio and Isabella should not perhaps be made till after Angelos speech to the provost who had only announced  a lady  and seems to be detained as a witness to the purity of the deputys conversation with her His  exit  may be fixed with that of Lucio and Isabella He cannot remain longer and there is no reason to think he departs before  Stay  yet a while  The old copies which dr Johnson pretends to have collated read Stay  a little while  p  Ang    Aside  She speaks and 'tis  Such sense that my sense  breeds  with it  That is says dr Johnson new thoughts are stirring in my mind new conceptions are  hatched  in my imagination So adds he we say to  brood  over thought But can this be right Does not the deputy plainly mean that  her wisdom  raised  his desires  p  Ang  As these black masks  Proclaim an  enshield  beauty ten times louder  Than beauty could  displayed  These masks  in mr Tyrwhitts opinion mean the  masks of the audience  an indecorum he thinks of which Shakspeare would hardly have been guilty to flatter a common audience he therefor concludes that the play may have been written to be acted at court  The remark is ingenious but not decisive It is hardly generous or candid to make the author absurd when his language or sentiment will obviously bear a different and rational interpretation The idea in Angelos speech might be easyly communicated by the mask which Isabella held in her hand And  these black masks  will in that case onely be  such masks as these  or  this kind of masks  Which doubtless is Shakspeares meaning  Enshield  is certainly put by contraction for  enshielded  and not by corruption for  inshe  'd  as mr Tyrwhitt would suppose  p  Duke  And here by this is your brother savedand the corrupt deputy  sealed  To  sca  e  is certainly to  reach  as dr Johnson explains it as well as to  disperse  or  spread abroad  and hence its application  to a routed army which is  scattered over the field  further than this it seems nothing to the purpose of mr Steevenses note The dukes meaning appears to be either that Angelo would be  overreached  as a town is by the scalade or that his true character would be  spread  or  lay'd open  so that his vileness would become evident Dr Warburtion thinks it is  weighed  a meaning which dr Johnson affixes to the word in another place  Scaling  his present bearing with his past  Coriolanus  p  Duke  I will presently go to St Lukes there at the moated  grange  resides this Mariana  A  grange  does not properly mean any  solitary farm house  as mr Steevens explains it It implies some one particular house immediately inferior in rank to a  hall  situated at a small distance from the town or village from which it takes its name as  Hornbygrange Blackwellgrange  and is in the neighbourhood simply called  the Grange  Originally perhaps these buildings were the lords  granary  or storehouse and the residence of his chief bailiff  Grange  Fr  Granagium  Lat This note may likewise serve to correct mr Wartons misinterpretation of the word in vol x p  p  Escal  Double and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind this would make  Mercy swear and play the tyrant  Certainly right We still say  to swear like an emperor  and from some old book of which the writer unfortunately neglected to copy the title he has noted  to swear like a tyrant To swear like a termagant  is quoted  elsewhere Dr Warburton would read mercy  swerve  and dr Farmer  severe  A similar passage occurs in  As you like it  Patience herself would startle at this letter  And  play the swaggerer  p  Duke  I am a brother  Of gracious order lately come from  the see  In special business from his holiness  The folio as dr Johnson observes reads  from the sea  And this seems the more probable reading For without it could be proved that  the see  was used by way of eminence and distinction for the papal court one may be satisfyed that Shakspeare intended to represent the friar as having come from his Holyness to Vienna by  sea  and so no doubt Shakspeare might imagine he did If it were not from the mention which occurs of  Poland  and  Russia  one might suppose the  Vienna  of this play to be not the capital of Austria but rather  Vienna  now  Vienne  in Dauphiné which was anciently a city of great fame governed by a duke  p  Duke  volumes of report  Run with these  false and most contrarious quests  That is says dr Johnson  reports running counter to each other  But  false and contrarious quests  in this place rather mean  lying and contradictory messengers  with whom  run volumes of report  An explanation which the line quoted by mr Steevens will serve to confirm  p  Abhor  A bawd Sir fie upon him he will discredit our  mi  tery  "I think it just worth while to observe" says dr Warburton "that the word  mystery  when used to signify a trade or manual profession should be spelt spelled with an  i  and not a  y  because it comes not from the Greek  but from the French  mestier  "  If it were worth the learned prelates while to make this observation it may be worth the while of an inferior person to contradict it For ingenious as the distinction may seem and implicitly as it has been adopted there is not the smallest authority for it unless the great critics dogmatical assertion may be termed so He doubtless thought that the word  mystery  was too sublime and sacred to be mixed with the profane and vulgar ideas of  base mechanicals  and that such vile objects as  trades  and  manual professions  ought not to participate in the use of a name set apart for the inexplicable solemnities of Christianity But the truth is that the word in its highest or lowest acceptation means no more or less than the  secret  or  arcana  of any CRAFT  civil  or  religious  in  faith  or in  works  and whether we are talking of the  mystery  of the  Blessed Trinity  or the  mystery  of the  BarberSurgeons  we mean  one and the same word  from  mystere  Fr of which  mestier  is only a corruption  mysterium  Lat  Gr  Mystery  should therefor be restored to the text whence it was the more unwarrantably ejected even according to the right reverend fathers hypothesis as it  there  signifies neither  trade  nor  manual profession  p  Clown  Master  Forthright  the  tilter  The old copy says dr Johnson reads  Forthlight  but this he conjectured should be  Forthright  alluding to the line in which the thrust is made And as he had it in  his power to alter the textso the text was altered  Forthlight  may nevertheless be the true reading certainly it should not have been so hastyly displaced It probably enough contains an allusion to the fencers threat of making the  light  shine through his antagonist  p  Barnar  What are you  Clown  Your  friends  fir the  hangman  This should be either  your  friend  sir the hangman  or  your friends sir the  hangmen  p  Duke  Unfit to live or die oh gravel heart  After him fellows  bring him to the block  The duke is wonderfully consistent not three lines below he calls the prisoner  A creature unprepar'd unmeet for death  and says that  to transport him in the mind he is  Were damnable  p  Ang  But that her tender shame  Will not proclaim against her maiden loss  How might she tongue me  Yet reason dares her no  For my authority bears a credent bulk  That no particular scandal once can touch  But it confounds the breather  Though all the editors and commentators differ about the meaning of this passage and even dr Johnson is not ashamed to say that he has  nothing to offer worth insertion  yet surely there is no such amazing difficulty in it  mr Upton and mr Upton onely has given the true and apparent sense The following are his own words which dr Johnson as he did not understand the passage and consequently their value has been pleased to mutilate  Were it not for her maiden modesty how might the lady proclaim my guilt Yet you'll say she has reason on her side and that will make her dare to do it I think not for my authority is of such weight  c  p  Duke  I'll limit thee this day  To seek thy  help  by beneficial help  Thus indeed the old editions but we should certainly read  life  p  Bal  For slander lives upon succession  For ever hous'd where't gets possession  On consulting the first folio says mr Steevens I found the second line had been lengthened out by the  modern  editors who read  For ever hous'd where it  once  gets possession  I have therefore adds he referred it to its former measure  If this ingenious gentleman had consulted the  second  folio he might have perceived that the line had not been lengthened nor indeed touched by the modern editors  p  S  Ant  Let love being light be drowned if  he  sink  The old editions read  she  But "I know not" says mr Steevens "to whom the pronoun  she  can be referred I have made no scruple to remove a letter from it" It would not however have been amiss if the ingenious critic had been somewhat more scrupulous on the  occasion as there need be little doubt to whom the pronoun  she  can be referred  i e  to  Love  Venus Thus in the old ballad of  The Spanish Lady  I will spend my days in prayer  Love  and all  her  laws defy  COMEDY OF ERRORS  p  Adr  Tell me was he arrested on a  band  S Dro  Not on a  band  but on a  stronger thing  A chain a chain  Band  is here rightly preserved but it is pleasant enough to mark the consistency of the editors who make a merit of restoring it from  bond  which they observe is in the old editions and was formerly spelled  band  The word  porpentine  appears throughout all the old copies and in many contemporary writers but this they have modernised to  porcupine  The affirmative  I  always used by Shakspeare and others has been likewise changed to  ay  and frequently to the injury of both sense and rime A number of words in every play are in the same predicament And even this identical word  band  is elsewhere turned into  band  Happy Shakspeare  A  band  Mr Steevens observes is likewise a  neckcloth  and on this circumstance he believes the humour of the passage turns But the ingenious gentleman is under a double mistake A  band  is not nor ever was a  neckcloth  though certainly an appendage to the neck Neither does the humour of the passage turn upon any such allusion for there would be very little humour in it if it  did Adriana means a  written band  and Dromio quibbles upon a  hempen one  p  Cour  Will you go with me we'll mend our dinner here  S Dro  Master if you do expect spoonmeat  or  bespeak a longer spoon  Or  says Mr Steevens which modern editors have thrown out of the text signifies  before  But the passage is wrong pointed And the  or  is a mistake for  and  We should read thus  Cour  We'll mend our dinner here  S Dro  Master if you do expect spoonmeat  and  bespeak a long spoon  Mr Steevenses remark does not seem much to the purpose  p  Abb  What doth ensue  But moody and dull melancholy  Kinsman  to grim and comfortless despair  And at her heels a hunge infectious troop  Of pale distemperature and foes to life  Shakspeare says dr Warburton could never make melancholy a  male  in one line and a  female  in the next he therefor boldly pronounces the line the foolish insertion of the first editors as if such fools could write as well as Shakspeare  Mr Heath in his fancyful way proposes a different reading while mr Steevens is contented with ridiculing the preciseness and affectation of master Capell  But after all the text is very clear and intelligible and certainly right  Kinsman  means no more than  near relation  Many words are used by Shakspeare with much greater latitude  p  Mess  Mistress  He cries for you and vows if he can take you  To  scorch  your face and to disfigure you  Dr Warburton would read  scotch  But mr Steevens defends the present reading which is certainly the true one and says that Antipholis would have punished her as he had punished the conjurer before He had  singed the conjurers beard off  Mr Steevens should have informed us how he it was to punish his  wife  in the same manner  p  Aegeon  Oh grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last  And careful hours with times deformed hand  Have written strange  defeatures  in my face  Defeature  says dr Johnson is the  privation of feature  The meaning adds he is time hath  cancelled my features  It is no uncommon thing to find the author and his commentator of different opinions What says Aegeon Why that Time had  written  defeatures in his face i e  given  them to him As to the commentators theirselves it is so very rarely we meet them agreeing that it is no wonder to find mr Steevens explaining  defeatures  by  undoings miscarriages misfortunes  from  defaire  Fr So that the meaning according to this ingenious gentleman will be  Time hath written in my face strange  undoings But  defeatures  are certainly neither more nor less than  features  as  demerits  are neither more nor less than  merits  Time says Aegeon hath placed  new and strange features  in my face  i e  given it quite a different appearance  no wonder therefor thou do'st not know me  Ibi  Aegeon  I am sure  thou  dost  E Dro  Ay  sir  But I am sure I do not and whatsoever  A man denies you are now  bound  to believe him  In the two old folios the passage stands and rightly thus  Aegeon  I am sure thou dost  E Dro  I sir  But I am sure I do not c  I  is herenot the adverb butthe personal pronoun  One great excellence of modern commentators consists in the art of discovering neglected puns It is some wonder therefor that this of Dromio should escape them The reader will remember that Aegeon is  actually in bonds  p  Duke  Besides  her urging of her wreck at sea  This mr Steevens observes is one of Shakspeares oversights The abbess has not so much as hinted at the shipwreck Perhaps indeed adds he this and the next speech should change places  That however would scarcely remove the difficulty the  next  speech is  Aegeons  Both it and the following one should precede the dukes or there is possibly a line lost  p  Bene  Let him him be clap'd on the shoulder and call'd  Adam  "Adam Bell" says dr Johnson "was a companion of Robin Hood as may be seen in Robin Hoods garland in which if I do not mistake" adds he "are these lines  "For he brought Adam Bell and Clim of the clough  "And William of Cloudeslee  "To shoot with our forester for forty mark  "And our forester beat them all three"  In answer to this it may be observed That Adam Bell was  not  a companion of Robin Hood That it  cannot  be seen in Robin Hoods garland That the lines quoted prove neither the one nor the other as they do not relate to  Robin Hood  It is peculiarly unfortunate that the leraned critic should be most mistaken where he is most confident  MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING  p  John  I had rather be a  canker  in a  hedge  than a  rose  in his grace  A  canker  dr Johnson tells is the  cankerrose dogrose cyn  b  sius  or  hip  But the word  canker  should rather seem to be used here as it is in various other places for the worm which preys upon flowers a metamorphosis suited to the ma  ignancy of the speakers disposition  Thus in the  Two Gentlemen of Verona  as in the  sweetest bud  The  eatingcanker  dwells  Again in the same play  as the most forward  bud  Is eaten by the  canker  ere it blow  "  Mallet  alias  Malloch  " in his beautyful ballad of  William and Margaret  has made a fine use of this idea  But  love  had like the  cankerworm  Consum'd her early prime  The  rose  grew pale and left her cheek  She dy'd before her time  It occurs likewise in the  Midsummer Nights Dream  Some to  kill cankers  in the  muskrose  buds  Again in the same play  O me you jugler oh you  cankerblossom  Upon which mr Steevens observes that  canker  blossom is not in this place the blossom of the  canker  or wildrose which our author alludes to in  Much ado about Nothing  act I sc vi the present text but a worm that preys on the leaves or buds of flowers always beginning in the middle" And the ingenious critic is certainly right in his exposition of the words  cankerblossom  but it may be safely affirmed that if  they  mean not the  wildrose canker  neither in the text nor any where else does  We meet with it again in  the First Part of Hen IV  O that this good blossom could be kept from  cankers  And plant this thorn this  canker  Bolingbroke  In this last passage it undoubtedy means what mr Steevens explains it to be  the wildrose  which it does not in the following  Hath not thy rose a  canker  Somerset  Hen    p  Pedro  See you where Benedick hath hid himself  Claud  O very well my lord the musick ended  We'll fit the  kidfox  with a pennyworth  i e  says dr Grey we'll be even with the  fox now discovered  So adds he the word  kid  or  kidde  signifies in Chaucer  To which mr Steevens does  not  dissent except by hinting that if any future editor should choose to read  hid  sox he may observe that Hamlet has said  "Hide  fox and all after"  A  kid fox  seems to be no more than a  young fox  or  cub  p  Dogb  Go good partner get you to  Francis  Seacoal bid him bring his pen and inkhorn  c  here's that shall drive some of them to a  noncom  Master Seacoals name

of humour  Dogberry  says of the prisoners that they are false knaves and from that denial of the charge which one in his wits could not but be supposed to make he infers a  communication of counsels  and records it in his examination as an  evidence of their guilt"  SIR J HAWKINS  It is with infinite reluctance that the writer finds hisself obliged to differ in opinion from the learned magistrate who from his having so long and so ably presided upon  similar occasions must no doubt be perfectly acquainted with the nature of a judicial process  That there is infinite humour in the passage is very true and that the ingenious commentator has not discovered it is equally so the sentiments and conduct of master Dogberry being the direct reverse of what he supposes them to be We clearly perceive that in this examination Dogberry takes all the precaution possible to come at the truth he charges them  severally  with being  false knaves  he  takes the utmost care  that they shall have  no communication of counsels  in order to concert a joint defence by onely  whispering  to  one  what he had before asked in the  hearing of both  he is therefore astonished to find them  both in a tale  and directs it to be recorded as a proof of their  innocencethat they are no knaves  because they had  both told him so  This is the more evident from the behaviour of the sexton who in mr Steevenses opinion and he seems perfectly right shews as  much good sense  on the occasion as any  judge upon the bench  could do and who immediately tells Dogberry that he  goes not the way to examine  and that he must  call the watch  c  If the learned annotator will amend his comment by omitting the word  guilt  and inserting the word  innocence  it will except as to the supposed inference of a communication of counsels which should be likewise omitted or corrected be a just and pertinent remark  p  Leon  If such a one will smile and stroke his beard  And  sorrow wag cry  hem

be used for a boy or child  The  imp  his son  is no more than  his infant son  It is now set apart to signify  young fiends  as  "the devil and his  imps"  p  Jaq  Fair weather after you  Dull  Come Jaquenetta away  "Maid  Fair weather after you Come Jaquenetta away  Thus all the printed copies but the editors have been guilty of much inadvertence They make Jaquenetta and a maid enter whereas Jaquenetta is the onely maid intended by the poet and is committed toDull to be conveyedto the lodge in the park This being the case it is evident to demonstration that  Fair weather after you  must be spoken by Jaquenetta and then that Dull says to her  Come Jaquenetta away  as I have regulated the text THEOBALD"  Mr Theobald has endeavoured here to dignify his own industry by a very slight performance The  folios  ALL read as he reads except that instead of naming the persons they give their characters enter  Clown Constable  and  Wench  JOHNSON"  There was no great occasion for this evidence to prove the last learned commentator very little acquainted with the editions of which he speaks with so much familiarity and confidence The assertion in the note is untrue NONE of the folios read as Theobald does in the first of them the passage stands thus  Maid  Fair weather after you  Clo    i e  Clown  Costard  not  Constable  Come Jaquee tta away  In the second and subsequent folios thus  Maid  Fair weather after you  Come Jaquenetta away  Mr Theobald does not appear to have inspected the first folio dr Johnson has evidently looked neither into that nor into any of the

arisen bears a variety of significations none of which is  fine delicate  or applicable to a thing of value Dr Johnsons quotation by no means proves  Jew  to have been a word of endearment  p  Hol

whether the poetical reader will easyly pardon the insertion of it in the inaccurate and corrupted state in which the learned critic has been pleased to give it For let us read what sir Henry hisself says  You meaner beauties of the night  That poorly satisfy our eyes  More by your number than your light  You  common people of the skies  What are ye when the  moon  shall rise  p  Pageant  of the  Nine Worthies This sort of procession was the usual recreation of our ancestors at Christmas and other festive seasons Such things being chiefly plotted and composed by ignorant people were seldom committed to writing at least with the view of preservation and are of course rarely discovered in the researches of even the most industrious antiquaries And it is certain that nothing of the kind except the speeches in this scene which were intended to burlesque them ever appeared in print The curious reader will not therefor be displeased to see a genuine specimen of the poetry and manner of this rude and ancient drama from an original manuscript of Edward the Fourths time MSS Tanner  IX Wurthy  Ector de troye  Thow achylles in bataly me slow  Of my wurthynes men speken J now  Alisander

commerce in Russia was at that time a matter that much ingrossed the concern and conversation of the publick There had been several embassies employed thither on that occasion and several tracts of the manners and state of that nation written so that a mask of Muscovites was as good an entertainment to the audience of that time as a coronation has been since WARBURTON"  All this may be very true but the learned commentator might have discovered that a mask of Muscovites was no uncommon recreation at court long before our authors time In the first year of king Henry the eighth at a banquet made for the foreign ambassadors in the parliament chamber at Westminster "came the lorde Henry Erle of W  ltshire  and the lorde Fitzwater in twoo long gounes of yelowe satin trauarsed with white satin and in euery ben of white was a bend of crimosen satin after the sashiō of Russia or Ruslande with furred hattes of grey on their hedes either of them hauyng an hatchet in their handes and bootes with pykes turned vp" Hall Hen VIII fo b This extract may serve to convey an idea of the dress used upon the present occasion by the king and his lords at the performance of the play  p  Dr Warburtons note upon the old Romances  The learned prelate has received such a complete dressing from the hand of a master in the  Supplement  that there is neither occasion nor opportunity for any further remark At the foot of this page however there is a note by the celebrated dr Percy which seems to deserve some little attention and the more so as it is countenanced by the very ingenious gentleman alluded to who has either not been aware of its fallacy or from private motives forborn to expose it  Dr Warburton" says this redoubted critic "is quite mistaken in deriving Oliver from Palmerin de Oliva which is utterly incompatible with the genius of the Spanish language" So that from his thus recurring to etymology he clearly appears to be not a whit better acquainted with the history than dr Warburton was "The old romance" continues he "of which Oliver was the hero is entitled in Spanish "Historias de los nobles Cavalleros Oliveros de Castilla y Artus de Algarbe in fol en Valladolid in fol en Sevilla " and in French thus "Histoire d'Olivier de Castille Aitus d'Algarbe son loyal compagnon de Heleine Fille au Roy d'Angleterre  c translatée du Latin par Phil Camus in fol Gothique"  From so much seeming knowlege from the annotators great credit and from his very confident assertions who would be foreward to suspect his ignorance or doubt his veracity But it is even so he knows no more of the history which he quotes with so much parade than bishop Warburton knew of Amadis or Palmerin with  either of which  the story of  Oliver the Paladin  has just as much connection as it has with the history of  Oliver of Castile and Arthur of Algarbe  With respect to the above French and Spanish titles they are literally transcribed from Fresnoy And so much for  dr Percys  acquaintance with old romances  VOLUME THE THIRD  MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM  p  Puck  A lovely boy s  ol'n from an Indian king  She never had so sweet a  changeling  Change  ing  says dr Johnson is commonly used for the child supposed to be left by the fairies but here for the child taken away  And it is  here  properly used and in its  common acceptation  that is for the  child got in exchange  Dr Johnson will recollect that a  Fairy  is now speaking  p  Puck  The  wisest aunt  telling the saddest tale  Some time for threefoot stool mistaketh me  Aunt  mr Steevens says is a  procuress  and the  wisest aunt  adds he may mean the most  sentimental bawd  But this conjecture is much too wanton and injurious to the word  aunt  which in this place at least certainly means no other than an  innocent old woman  p  Ob  The  human mortals  want their winter here  Shakspeare says mr Steevens might have employed this epithet  human mortals  which at first appears redundant to mark the difference between  men  and  sairies  Fairies adds he were not  human  but they were yet  subject to mortality  This however does not by any means appear to have been the case Oberon Titania and Puck never dye the inferior agents must necessaryly be supposed to enjoy the same privilege and the ingenious commentator may rely upon it that the oldest woman in England never heard of the death of a Fairy  Human mortals  is notwithstanding evidently put in opposition to  Fairies  who partook of a middle nature between  men  and  spirits  Puck in a subsequent scene says  Lord what fools these  mortals  be  p  Puck  The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort  Who Pyramus presented in their sport  Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake  When I did him at this advantage take  An ass's nowl I fixed on his head  Anon his Thisby must be answered  And forth my  minnock  comes  Minnock  dr Johnson says is the reading of the old quarto and he believes right  Minnekin  adds he now  minx  is a  nice trifling girl  The folio according to mr Steevens reads  mimmick  perhaps for  mimick  a word more familiar than that exhibited by one of the tos for the other reads  minnick  After all  minnock mimmick  and  minnick  are onely perhaps misprints for  mommock  which comes nearly to the same letters and signifies  a huge misshapen thing  and is very properly applyed by a Fairy to a clumsy overgrown clown  Minnekin  is evidently a corruption of  mannekin  or  manikin  properly  mankin  MANNIK  N s  man  and  klein  German JOHNSONS DICTIONARY  a little man Dr Johnson is so very imperfectly acquainted with the nature and derivation of the English language and in that respect his dictionary how valuable soever it may be on account of the explanation and use of English words is beneath contempt there being scarcelyten words properly deduced in the whole work that it is no wonder to find him making  minnekin  and  minx  the same word But  minnekin  does  not  mean a  nice trifling girl  and though a substantive is oftener used adjectively than otherwise so in  Midas  not John Lylies "  My  minikin  miss  M  N KIN  small diminutive  Shakespeare  IBI  " The smallest

stamping  or of a size that should give force to a stamp nor could they have distinguished the stamps of such from those of their own companions" He therefor reads  And at a  stump  here o'er and o'er one falls  To prove however that Fairies  could stamp  mr Steevens produces a passage from Olaus Wormius He need not have gone so much out of his way honest Reginald Scot could have informed him that our "grandams maides were woont to set a boll of milke before 'Incubus' and his cousine Robin goodfellow for grinding of malt or mustard and sweeping the house at midnight andthat he would chase exceedingly if the maid or goodwife of the house hauing compassion of his nakednes laid anie clothes for him beesides his messe of white bread and milke which was his standing see For in that case he

with our  neelds  created both one flower  All the old editions it seems read  needles  But mr Steevens has altered it to  neelds  as he says "it was  probably  written by Shakspeare"  The learned critic has made the same innovation in another place and quoted this very passage  as genuine  to justify the change and yet where the word  candlesticks  was a syllable too much and the old editions read  cansticks  which rendered the measure perfect and was supported by the authority of many ancient authors he has continued  candlesticks  in the text  Puck  Ho ho ho  coward why comest thon not  It may be remarked that this exclamation is peculiar to Puck In the old song printed by Peck in which he relates all his gambols he concludes every verse with  Ho ho ho  He here forgets his assumed character  p  Hel  So me thinks  And I have found Demetrius like a jewel  Mine own and not mine own  Instead of  jewel  dr Warburton would read  gemel  a  twin  which dr Johnson calls an ingenious emendation that deserves to be true But dr Warburton is in evident confusion about the passage He makes Helena compare her lover to something which had the property of appearing one thing when it was another not the property sure he cries of a jewel In reality however Helena makes no such comparison and the learned critic wilfully misstates her words to found his  ingenious emendation  as every foolish and impertinent proposal is by the courtesy of editors intitled She says that  she has found Demetrius as a person finds a jewel or thing of great value in which his property is so precarious as to make it uncertain whether it belongs to him or not  p  Bot  I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream and I will sing it in the latter end of  a play  before the duke Peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall sing it  at her death  Instead of  a play  we should certainly read  the play  i e that which they were about to perform  At her death  is very judiciously corrected by mr Theobald to  after death  and so should have been here printed  p  The  Call  Philostrate  In the folio says mr Steevens it isCall  Egeus  and  all  the speeches spoken by Philostrate are there given to that character If the ingenious commentator will take the trouble to look into either folio at the speech beginning  No my noble lord  It is not for you  he will find that  all  the speeches here spoken by  Philostrate  are  not  there given to  Egeus  p  n  Mr Steevens is certainly mistaken in assigning Spensers death to Dublin He dyed in  Kingstreet Westminster  and was buryed in Westminsterabbey  p  Enter  Pyramus  and  Thisbe  c  There is an old pamphlet containing the history of this amourous pair in lamentable verse by one Dunstan Gale which appears to have been printed in and may not improbably befound the but of Shakspeares ridicule in some parts of this interlude  p  Lion  Then know that I  as  Snug the joiner am  A lion fell  nor else  no lions dam  The folio reads  Then know that I  one  Snug the joiner am  A lion fell nor else no lions dam  This  i e A  lion fell says mr Steevens not agreeing with the remainder of the speech the modern editors have altered it into  no  lion fell Had they continues he consulted the quarto it would have set them right  Then know that I  as  Snug the joyner am  A lion fell nor else no lyons dam  A reading which this ingenious gentleman has accordingly adopted It is nevertheless certainly wrong and that of the folio is certainly right  At the rehearsal of the play lest "the ladies should be afear'd of the lion" being as Bottom observes "the most fearful wild fowl living" it was settled that there should be a prologue to tell that Snug who was to perform this terrible part was  not  a lion his name was likewise to be named and half his face seen through the lions neck through which he was moreover to speak "saying thus or to this defectLadies  c  If you think I come hither  as a lion  it were pity of my life no I am  no such thing I am a man as other men are"  and there indeed he was "to name his name and tell them plainly he 'was' Snug the joiner" This prologue he is now delivering but the passage must be read and pointed thus the sense and meaning being strangely misconceived and misrepresented by the present editors  Then know that I one Snug the joiner am  A lion fell nor else no lions dam  For if I should as lion come in strife  Into this place 'twere pity of my life  That is I am neither  lion  nor  lioness  I am  Snug the joiner  The text makes him declare that he  is  a lion or comes  as  a lion which is utterly inconsistent with the rest of his speech defeats the very end and design of his prologue and would have been enough "God shield us" to scare the ladies out of their wits The use of the sing  e negative with a double aspect is common with our author and other ancient writers Thus Fletcher in his animated apostrophe to the memory of Spenser  O may that man that hath the Muses scorn'd  Alive  nor  dead be ever of a Muse adorn'd  Instead of  ever  a late editor of Spenser not so intimate perhaps with the language of his author and his contemporaties as he ought to have been proposes to read  never    The conclusion is that "the modern editors" who read  no  were perfectly right in point of construction though the alteration was unnecessary and improper

oft  In the Rialto you have rated me  About my monies and my  usances  Use  and  usance  mr Steevens says are both words anciently employed for  usury  And to justify the explanation he quotes the two following passages from an old play  Give me my  use  give me my principal  A toy the main about five hundred pounds  And the  use  fifty  But after all is he not mistaken  Use  and  usance  mean nothing more than  interest  And the former word is still used by country people in the same sense His own authorities prove this to be the ancient meaning  Give me my  interest  give me my principal The  main  i e  the principal  five hundred pounds and the use fifty  i e  interest  at  ten per cent  the  legal rate  in Shakspeares time when perhaps the word  usury  itsself had a much more innocent meaning than has been since annexed to it In the old song of  Neptunes raging fury or the gallant seamans sufferings  it signifies onely a  scrivener  The lawyer and the  usurer  That sits in gowns of fur  c  p  Antho  For when did friendship take  A breed  of  barren metal of his friend  The quartos mr Steevens says reada breed  of  the folioa breed  for  The ingenious commentator has not it seems paid his usual attention to the foliosboth which assuredly read  of  p  Laun  I am Launcelot  your boy that was your son that is and your child that shall be  The distinction between  boy  and  son  dr Johnson sagaciously remarks is obvious but  child  adds he seems to have had some meaning which is now lost Mr Steevens supposes that by  your child that shall be  he means that his duty to his father should in future shew him to be his child There is not the least difficulty in the passage Launcelot is talking nonsense or as the vulgar have it putting the cart before the horse but whether designedly or not is left to the contemplation of the critics He means however to say  I  was  your  child  I  am  your  boy  and  shall ever be  your  son  p  Shy  thou shalt not  gormandize  As thou hast done with me  "The word  gormandize  is very ancient and took its rise from a Danish king The Danes towards the latter end of the ninth century were defeated by king Alfred at Edendon in Wiltshire and as an article of peace Guthrum their king commonly called Gurmond submitted to be baptized king Alfred being his godfather who gave him the name of Athelstan and took him for his adopted  son During the stay of the Danes in Wiltshire "they consumed their time in profuseness and bellycheer in idleness and sloth Insomuch that as from their laziness in general we e  en to this day call them  LurDanes  so from the licentiousness of Gurmond and his army in particular we brand all luxuricus and profuse people by the name of  Gurmondizers  " And this luxury and this laziness are the sole monuments the only memorials by which the Danes have made themselves notorious to posterity by being encamped in Wiltshire Vide  A Vindication of StoneHeng restored  by John Webb esq p  n Jonson in his  Sejanus  act I  "That great  Gourmond  fat Apicius G"  After such a pompous display of learning so strangely introduced into the margin of Shakspeare how will this mr G who has certainly shewed if not judgement at least prudence in concealing his name be surprised to hear that there is not a single j  t either of sense or of truth from the beginning to the end of his laborious dissertation  Gourmand  a glutton and  Gourmandise  glutro  y whence Jon  ons  Gourmond  and our  gormandize  are immediately taken are common French words to be found in every dictionary a  d  Lurdane  properly  l  urden  is derived from  lourdin  or  fal  urdin  a word of the same signification in the same language equally common Either  Gourmond  or  Lurdane  therefor has no more possibly much less connection with the ancient Danes than it has with this same mr G the structor of the above ingenious but alas too easyly demolished fabric  p  Where is my lady  P  r  Here what would  my lord  "Would not this speech to the servant be more proper in the mouth of  Nerissa  TYRWHITT"  No very impertinent in the presence of her lady  p  Sal  I would it might prove the end of his losses  Sala  Let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross  thy  prayer  All the old copies read  my  prayer but says Warburton the prayer was  Salanios  The other onely as clerk says  amen  to it he therefor changed it to  thy  prayer The old reading however may be very right Is not  amen  a prayer  p  Por  I could not  do  with all  "For the sense of the word  do  in this place see a note on  Measure for Measure  act I COLLINS"  The conversation of even the highest ranks was not perhaps in Shakspeares time over and above remarkable for its delicacy But does the  real  commentator believe that a lady of Portias good sense high station and elegant manners could  speak  or even  think    so grossly  It is impossible  This observation and others of the like nature from the same hand are however as the reader will perceive strictly within the canon  "He  i e  the professed critic may find out a bawdy or immoral meaning in his author where there does not appear to be any hint that way" Canon XII  p  Shy  And others when the bagpipe sings i'the nose  Cannot contain their urine  For affections  Masters of passion sway  it to the mood  Of what it likes or loath    The reading of all the old editions is  And others when the bagpipe sings i'th' nose  Cannot contain their urine for  affection  Masters of passion  sways  it to the mood  Of what it likes or loaths  Which is surely defensible though our candid editors have not been pleased to notice it The meaning is that  some men when they hear the sound of a bagpipe are  so affected therewith  that they cannot retain their urine For those things which are masters over passion make it like or loath whatever they will  If  sways  be objected to it may be easyly altered to  sway  But there are above fifty instances in Shakspeare where a verb of the singular number is made to agree with a noun of the plural  p  S  y  Why he a  woollen bagpipe  It is not unusual to see the large skin or bladder of a bagpipe covered with  flannel  and it is possible that Shakspeare onely used the word as a descriptive epithet  Dr Johnson supposes he wrote  wooden  sir John Hawkins  swelling  or  swollen  But any meaning is preferable to such arbitrary violations of the text  p  Por  Shylock there's  thrice  thy money offer'd thee  Where or by whom is any such offer made Bassanio indeed in answer to Portias question  if Anthonio were not able to discharge the money  says  Yes here  I tender it for him in the court  Yea  twice  the sum  But nobody offers  thrice the money  Either Portia mistook Bassanios proposal or this is one of those inaccuracies of the text which are now irremediable  p  Duke  For half thy wealth it is Anthonios  The other half comes to the general state  Which humbleness may drive unto a fine  Anth  So please my lord the duke and all the court  To quit the fine for one half of his goods  I am content  so be will let me have  The other half in use  to render it  Upon his death  unto the gentleman  That lately stole his daughter  The terms proposed says dr Johnson have been misunderstood Anthonio declares that as the duke quits one half of the forfeiture he is likewise content to abate his claim and desires not the property but the  use  or produce only of the half and that only for the Jews life unless we read as perhaps is right  upon  my death  How others have misunderstood Anthonios terms does not by this edition appear and it might be policy in dr Johnson to suppress the account for it is very clear that they are  not  understood by HIM Anthonio tells the duke that if he will abate the fine for the states half he Anthonio will be contented to take the other  in trust  after Shylocks death to render it to his daughters husband That is it was during Shylocks life to remain  at interest  in  Anthonios  hands and  Shylock  was to enjoy the  produce of it  The present reading is perfectly right clear and intelligible  And these trifling mistakes might teach even the greatest critic some little diffidence upon similar occasions  p  Laun  Tell him there's a post come from my master with his horn full of good news my master will be here ere morning  sweet soul  Exit  Ler  Let's in and there expect his coming  These two words mr Tyrwhitt observes should certainly be taken from the end of Launcelots speech and placed at the begining of the following speech of Lorenzo An excellent and happy remark No alteration was ever more necessary or more obvious The  two syllables  thus misplaced and which are utterly absurd and insensible as they stand are just wanting to make up the metre of the first line of Lorenzos speech The emendation is therefor unpardonably neglected  p  P  The Merchant of Venice  "A  ballad  is still remaining on the subject of  Romeo and Juliet  which by the date appears to be much older than Shakspeares time It is remarkable that all the particulars in which that play differs from the story in Bandello are found in this  ballad  "  Where is

and as thou fa  'st charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well  Dr Warburton would substitute  my fath  r  in the place of  fashion  Dr Johnson allows that the nominative  my father  is left out but says it is so left out that the auditor inserts it in spite of himself An auditors understanding the intent of a speech will not however supply the defects of its grammatical construction There is no necessity for omitting the word  fashion  but either  my father  or which is perhaps much better the pronoun  he  should be inserted between  fashion  and  bequeathed  The passage ought therefor to be read and pointed thus As I remember Adam it was on this fashion he bequeathed me by will but a poor thousand ducats  c  The reader will perceive that it is onely the sequel of a

with a trowel  Laid on with a trowel dr Johnson supposes to mean "too heavy a mass of big words laid upon a slight subject" But mr Steevens will have it to be a "proverbial expression generally used to signify a  glaring falshood  " The doctor is not right and the gentleman palpably wrong It means a good round hit thrown in without judgement or design So in  Tony Lumpkin in Town    "Tim that was

the gods for thy  foulness sluttishness  may come hereafter  By  foul  says Hanmer is meant  coy  or  frowning  Mr Tyrwhitt rather believes it to be the rustic pronunciation of  full  as if she thanked the gods for a  bellyfull  Audrey says she is not  fair  i e  handsome  and therefor prays the gods to make her  honest  The clown tells her that to cast  honesty  away upon a  foul slut  i e an  ill favoured dirty crecture  is to put meat in an unclean dish She replies she is no  slut  no  dirty drab  though in her great simplicity she thanks the gods for her  soulness  homelyness  i e

 Orlando  Thus says mr Steevens the old copy The modern editors adds he read but without the least authority  I wonder much Orlando is not here  This is sense however which the old and present reading is not though there was no necessity for so great an  teration to make it so One might propose the following  Is it not past two o'clock and here's  no  Orlando  p  Clo  We found our quarrel was upon the  seventh cause  So says dr Johnson all the copies but it is apparent adds he from the sequel that we must read  the quarrel was  not  upon the seventh cause  The propriety of this remark is very doubtfull Jaques a few speeches after asks the clown How he and his antagonist found the quarrel was upon the  seventh cause  The clown says upon a  lye seven times remov'd  and thus explains it His dislike of the courtiers beard The courtiers  retort courteous  The  quip modest  The  reply churlish  The  reproof valiant  The  countercheek quarrelsome  The  lye circumstantial  This may indeed be called the  seventh cause  but it certainly is not a  lye seven times removed  Touchstone is rather inaccurate in his calculations but dr Johnsons proposal seems inadmissible After all it is not easy to conceive how either the  lye circumstantial  or the  lye direct  could be a greater affront than the  countercheck quarrelsome  which was simply thus YOU LYE  TAMING OF THE SHREW  p  Sly  Am not I Christopher Sly old Slys son  of Burtonheath  Ask  Marian Hacket  the  fat alewife  of  Wincot  if she know me not  c  Mr Steevens suspects that we should read  Bartonheath Barton  and  Woodmancot  vulgarly  Woncot  being both in Gloustershire near the residence of Justice Shallow The ingenious observer might have recollected  William Visor  of Wonc  t  But the matter is fully cleared up by the celebrated mr Warton who positively assures us that Wilnecotte is a village in Warwickshire  with which Shakspeare was well acquainted  near Stratford That the house  kept by our genial ho  iess  still remains but is at present a mill A stranger to the chronology of mr Wartons life would be apt to conclude from this satisfactory information that Shakspeare and he had had many a merry meeting over a cup of our genial hostesses Warwickshire ale or how should he suppose him to have come by such a perfect knowlege of the house our authors intimate acquaintance with it and the character of its mistress  Burton Dorset  is a village in Warwickshire  p  Hor  Sweet Bianca  Happy man be his dole  A proverbial expression mr Steevens tells us  Dole  being any thing dealt out or distributed But what sort of an explanation is this The meaning is let his  portion  or  lot  in life be that of a happy man  p  Hor  Alla nostra casa ben venuto  Melto h  norato sign  r mio  Petruchio  Surely the

negligence in not consulting the old copies  VOLUME THE FOURTH  ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL  p  Clo  As fit as  Tibs rush  for  Toms forefinger  It behoveth me here to remark that this abridged nominative  Tib  is not as the great musical knight opineth a contraction of  Tabitha  but is the diminutive of  Isabel  Moreover the  forefinger  is not as master Tollet conceiveth the  thumb  but that finger which is usually placed next or nearest thereunto Meseemeth likewise that our author hath here one of those covert allusions divers of which my singular good friend M  Collins  and myself have heretofore noted and shall  Deo juvante  persever to remark in our future lucubrations AMNER  p  Dia  If I should swear by  Joves  great attributes  "In the print of the old folio it is doubtful whether it be  Jove's  or  Love's  the characters being not distinguishable JOHNSON"  It is no wonder that the learned critic should not have been able to distinguish between an    and an  l  where he could not perceive the variation of whole words and even  lines and speeches No one beside hisself however could possibly have had a doubt about the matter the two characters being as clearly different in the old editions as they are any where else  But this is not the onely instance in which the ingenious commentator could not determine whether the word were  love  or  Jove  He is at the same loss in  Troilus and Cressida  x where the  l  is equally conspicuous  p  Clo  O madam yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet on's face whether there be a scar under it or no the velvet knows  c  Count  A fear nobly gotis a good livery of honour  The old editions give the latter speech to  Lafeu  from whom it has been taken without either acknowlegement or necessity  TWELFTH NIGHT  p  Mar  My lady  takes  great exceptions to your ill hours  Sir To  Why let her  except before excepted  This says dr Farmer should probably be  as  before excepted a ludicrous use of the formal  lawphrase  But the ingenious critic mìght have spared his remark the  formal lawphrase  being more usually as in the text  p  Vio  She made good view of me indeed so much  That  sure  methought her

lieutenant I have a  stoop  of wine STEEVENS  Compare the following passage and note  Hamlet  x  King  Set me the  stoups  of wine upon the table  "A  stoup  is a  flaggon  or  bowl  STEEVENS"  This explanation may be right  Cup  is certainly wrong  p  Mar  My purpose is indeed a horse of that colour  Sir And  And your  horse  now would make him an  ass  Mar Ass  I doubt not  Mr Tyrwh  tt thinks that the conceit given to sir Andrew shews too quick an apprehension for him He would therefor transfer it to sir  Toby  But does the ingenious critic imagine it probable that  Maria  would call sir  Toby  an  ass  p  Sir To  Marry hang thee  brock  A  brock  is certainly a badger but Malvolio is not so called because he is likely to be  hunted  and persecuted like that animal which by the way is  never hunted  Neither is  to badger  a man a phrase for making a fool of him Sir Toby uses the word as a term of contempt as if he had said  hang thee  cur  Out  filth to stink like a  brock  being proverbial To  badger  a man is to be perpetually plagueing him the badger from that spirit of humanity so prevalent in the English vulgar being always  baited to death  p  Sir T  How now my  nettle  of India  The old copy mr Steevens says readsmettle  of India  which he thinks is probably the true reading The change he tells us was made by mr Rowe  Nettle  however as the learned commentator ought to have known is the reading of the second folio and is indisputably right  p  Sir To  Challenge me the counts youth  to fight with him  This mr Tyrwhitt pronounces to be nonsense he would have us read  challenge me the counts youth  go  fight with him  But if any alteration be necessary it should be thus  Challenge me the counts youth to fight with  you The text however is neither nonsensical nor difficult  p  Sir To  Why man he's a very devil I have not seen such a  virago  The word  virago  is certainly inapplicable to a man a blustering hectoring fellow as Sir Toby means to represent Viola for he cannot possibly entertain any suspicion of her sex but it is no otherwise so than  Rounceval  is to a woman meaning a terrible fighting blade from Ronceval or Roncesvalles the famous scene of that fabulous combat with the Saracens  When Charlemagne and all his Peerage fell  By Fontarabia  p  Sir To  Nay if you be an  undertaker  I am for you  This mr Tyrwhitt believes a  touch upon the times  in allusion to certain persons who in the reign of king James  the first  undertook  to carry all the government measures smoothly through parliament But what has Antonio said or done that Sir Toby should take  him  for a  busy member of the house of commons  He onely means to tell him that if he be an undertaker of or intermeddler in other peoples quarrels he Sir Toby is ready to take him up  p  Clo  What say you sir I am  shent  for speaking to you  Shent  i e rated scolded abused The two instances adduced by mr Steevens give it a meaning quite foreign to the text  p  Sir Toby  Ay  biddy come with me  This seems to be a scrap of some old song and should be printed as such Did the editors understand it that they have given us no annotation upon it  Biddy  is the diminutive of  Bridget  p  Sir To  we willcrown thee for a  finder of madmen  Dr Johnson thinks this phrase an allusion to  witchfinders  But mr Steevens pronounces it a satire on those  coroners  who so often bring in selfmurder lunacy to which title he says many other offences have to the full as just pretensions The observation is however scarcely pertinent as it is not the  officer  but the  inquest  that makes the return And perhaps while such inhuman such diabolical laws as the brutality of the most barbarous ages has annexed to the commission of the above act continue to disgrace the judicial system of this country even  perjury itsself  becomes a  virtue  Finders of madmen  are those who formerly acted under the writ  De Lunatico inquirendo  p  Sir To    meddle  you must that's certain  Meddle  mr Steevens explains  mix  but it means to interfere have to do with concern ones self  c  as before explained  p  Clo  The bells of  St Bennet  What necessity is there for accusing Shakspeare of any impropriety in this place There must have been churches in Illyria and how does dr Johnson know that none of them was dedicated to St Bennet  p  Oli  A most  extracting  frenzy of mine own  From my remembrance clearly banish'd his  i e  says dr Warburton a frenzy that  drew me away  from every thing but its own object But mr Malone ever studious to preserve his authors text till some example is produced of the word being used in the above sense should wish to read  distracting  which he very modestly conjectures to have been the original word If dr Warburton had considered his explanation a single moment he would undoubtedly have given it right  i e  a frenzy that  drew  every object but one  out  of my memory  Ibid  Clo  An your ladyship will have it  i e  Malvolios letter as it ought to be you must allow  vox  "I am by no means certain" says mr Steevens "that I understand this passage" The learned editors diffidence must therefor apologise for his having mistaken it the meaning is nevertheless very simple  If your ladyship says the Clown will have this letter read as it should be you must allow me the full and proper use of my  voice  She had just checked him for bawling too loud which he tells her is the right method of reading a madmans letter  WINTERS TALE  p  Leo    lower messes  Perchance are to this business purblind  Mess  says dr Johnson is a contraction of  master  as  Mess  John master John an appellation used by the Scots to those who have taken their academical degree  Lower messes  therefor adds he are graduates of a lower form Mr Steevens however believes that  lower messes  is onely used to signify the lowest lower degrees about the court A conjecture in which he seems to be as right as dr Johnson is certainly wrong the word  mess  as  Mess  John neither being any contraction of  master  nor having the remotest allusion to academical degrees It is merely the Scotish pronunciation of  Mass  and is only applyed in vulgar language to the  priest  or  minister  p  Cam  I have lov'd thee    Leo  Make that thy question and go rot  Nothing can be more obvious than that the words here put into the mouth of Camillo really belong to Leontes whom he neither does nor could address with so much familiarity But we are under no necessity to agree with mr Tyrwhitt that they would come in more properly after  rot  If the measure be thought to need emendation it would be less violence to adopt that proposed by mr Theobald  p  Ant  I have three daughters the eldest is eleven  The second and the third nine and  some five  "This" says dr Johnson "is mr Theobalds correction the former editions read  sans  five"  If the critic mean to say onely that some editions prior to Theobalds read  sans  the assertion may probably be true but if his note imply that Theobald first introduced the word  some  nothing can be less so it is the reading of the first folio and the second does not read  sans  The speaker tells us that one of his daughters was eleven the second nine and the third  about  five  p  Leo  I ne'er heard yet  That any of these bolder vices  wanted  Less  impudence to gainsay what they did  Than to perform it first  "It is apparent" dr Johnson says "that according to the proper at least according to the present use of words  less  should be  more  or  wanted  should be  had"  It is a pity that the learned critic should not better understand the language upon which he professes to comment There is not the slightest difficulty or impropriety in the passage I never heard says Leontes that any of  these greater offenders wanted  i e  were deficient in less impudence to deny their crime than to commit it You therefor he means to tell the queen who have had sufficient impudence to do what I charge you with can be at no loss for impudence to deny it  p  Flo  the gods themselves  Humbling their deities to love have taken  The shapes of beasts upon themtheir

Warburton is replied by the king in answer to the shepherds saying  since these good men  are pleased  This is very unlikely The dance which has intervened would take up too much time to preserve any connection between the two speeches The line spoken by the king seems to be in reply to some unexpressed question from the old shepherd and should not be uttered  aside  MACBETH  p  Mach  The  prince of Cumberland    The crown of Scotland mr Steevens observes was originally not hereditary When a successor was declared in the life time of a king as was often the case the title of  prince of Cumberland  was immediately bestowed on him as the mark of his designation  The propriety of this note is not very apparent  The crown of Scotland had been hereditary for ages before Duncannay from the very foundation of the Scotish monarchy The  apparent  or  presumptive heir  was always the known and declared successor as in England and every other hereditary government The kings  eldest son  or grandson  i e  the heir apparent for the time being alone was  prince of Cumberland  as the king of Englands is prince of  Wales or the king of France's the Dauphin And it should seem from the play that Malcolm was the  first  who had this title  p  March  No this my hand will rather  The multitudinous  seas  incarnadine  Making  the greenone red  Whoever was the author of this emendation as it is called for mr Sheridan has likewise taken the credit of it  Lectures on Elocution  to p it seems to have been adopted with too much haste and without either necessity or advantage The old reading

indulge myself too far in departing from the established reading yet I cannot but propose the rejection of this passage which I believe was an insertion of some player that having so much learning as to discover to what Shakspeare alluded was not willing that his audience should be less knowing than himself and has therefore weakened the  authours sense by the intrusion of a remote and useless image into a speech bursting from a man wholly possessed with his own present condition and therefore not at leisure to explain his allusions to himself If these words are taken away by which not only the thought but the numbers are injured the lines of Shakespeare close together without any traces of a break  My genius is rebuk'd He chid the sisters  JOHNSON"  This note dr Johnson tells us was written before he was fully acquainted with Shakspeares manner and he does not now think it of so much weight why did he then reprint it because the words which he once thought interpolated by the players he now thinks to have been interpolated by the author But there never was surely such a number of words wasted to such an idle purpose Whether Macbeth would have made use of the image is not the question the words are as evidently Shakspeares as any others in the play And where was the necessity of so much  learning  to discover the allusion The idea was persectly familiar to him He got it from the old translation of Plutarch and has particularly dwelled upon it in  Ant  ny and Cleopatra  act II scene iii  p  Mach  Better be with the dead  Whom we to gain our  place  have sent to peace  The old copy according to mr Steevens reads  Whom we to gain our  peace  have sent to peace  The change he says was made by mr Rowe It is however the reading of the second folio  p  Mach  Ere  The  shardborne beetle  with his drowsy hum  Hath  rung nights yawning peal  c  The  shardborn  beetle is perhaps the beetle  born  among  shards  i e not cowsdung for that is only a secondary or metonymical signification of the word and not even so generally but pieces of broken pots tiles and such like things which are frequently thrown together in corners as rubbish and under which these beetles may usually breed or what is all the same may have been supposed to do so  Thus in Hamlet the priest says of Ophelia  Shards  flints and pebbles should be thrown on her  Would mr Tollet say that  cowsdung  was to be thrown into the grave The spelling of  born  can have no weight any way It is true however that  sharded beetle  seems scarcely reconcilable to the above explanation Mr Steevens  may  be  right  but dr Warburton and mr Tollet are  certainly wrong  p  Enter three murderers    Mur  But who bid thee join with us    Mur  Macbeth    Mur  He needs not our mistrust since he delivers  Our offices and what we have to do  To the direction just  The meaning of this abrupt dialogue dr Johnson observes is this the  perfect spy  mentioned by Macbeth in the foregoing scene has before they enter upon the stage given them the directions which were promised at the time of their agreement yet one of the murderers suborned  suspects him of intending to betray them the other observes that by his exact knowledge of  what they were to do  he appears to be employed by Macbeth and needs not be mistrusted A comment which there are sew besides the learned author that would not have been ashamed to repeat  In the preceding scene Macbeth says to the two first murderers  I will advise you where to plant yourselves  Acquaint you with  the  perfect spy o'the time  The moment on't  i e  the very time when you are to look out for him But dr Johnson has changed it to  A  perfect spy o'the time  and seems too consident or too careless to perceive the absurdity he introduces For if Macbeth had made the two first murderers acquainted with this  perfect spy  of dr Johnson and they had received their directions from him how could the first murderer possibly ask him  who  bid him join themO but says the learned critic he suspects him of an intention to betray them Betray them To whom To Banquo To be sure they had wonderful cause to be afraid of one whom the king hisself had appointed them to killThe fact plainly is that this additional or supernumerary villain is sent from Macbeth by way of reinforcement after the others had taken their stand He has told them that he was acquainted with the design but one of them being unwilling it should seem to admit a third to participate in the reward and therefor desirous to shuffle him off very naturally asks who bid  him  join them  p  Macd  Bleed bleed poor country  Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure  For goodness dares not check thee wear thou thy wrongs  His  title is  affcard  His    i e  Macbeths title is  affeer'd i e  established or affirmed since he whose duty and interest it is to endeavour to dethrone him refuses to join in the attempt This kind of exclamation seems natural to Macduff for a little after when Malcolm striyes to comfort him on the slaughter of his wise and children he breaks forth in the same manner  He    i e  Maleolm and not Macheth as mr Steevens supposes  has no childrenall my pretty ones  p  Mal  'Tis call'd the  evil  strangely visited people  All swoln and ulcerous  he curts  Hanging a golden stamp about their necks  Put on with holy prayers and 'tis spoken  To the succeeding royalty he leaves  The healing benediction With this strange virtue  He hath a heavenly  gift of prophery  c  "It must be owned" says dr Warburton "that Shakspeare is often guilty of some strange absurdities in point of history and chronology yet here he has artfully avoided one He had a mind to hint that the cure of the  evil  was to descend to the successors in the royal line in compliment to James the first But the Consessor was the first who pretended to the gift how then could it be at that time generally spoken of that the gift was hereditary this he has solved by telling us that Edward had the gift of prophecy along with it"  "The ingenious editor of the  Houshold Book  of  the Fifth Earle of Northumberland  dr Percy" adds mr Steevens "very acutely observes on the subject of cramp rings "that the miraculous gift of curing the  evil  was left to be claimed by the Stuarts our ancient Plantagenets were humbly content to cure the  cramp"  There may be a vast fund of  acuteness  but there is not a tittle of  truth  or  knowlege  in this ingenious observation It is so well known that not onely the  Tudor  family but their predecessors for many ages exercised this real or imaginary power that in the reign of queen Elizabeth who  touched  often as any old history and many other books will inform us one William Tooker a learned divine published a laborious Latin treatise upon the subject in which he enumerates a number of  cures  performed by that princess and others of our ancient English monarchs  See much curious information on this subject in the reverend dr Douglases  Criterion or Miracles examined  London p  c  Henry VII and Edward I are proved to have  touched  for the evil by contemporary writers and the notion of such an inherent power in our kings appears by indisputable authority to have been as thoroughly established in the reign of Henry II as it was in that of Charles II or Queen Ann  With respect to dr Warburton one would be glad to know how he became so certain that Edward the Confessor was the first who pretended to this gift Shakspeare may be sometimes chargeable with great absurdities but he rarely if ever commits such a one as his overlearned commentator would here force upon him If  Edward the Consessor  had been the  first  English monarch possessed of this  hereditary faculty  it must necessaryly have  dyed with him  for he not onely was a  usurper  but  left no issue  So that king James neither did nor possibly could either  claim  or  get  it from  him  And his real titles were too  good and he was too well acquainted with them to permit him to accept such a  compliment  even if Shakspeare intended it which he undoubtedly did not  p  Rosse  But I have words  That would be howl'd out in the desert air  Where hearing should not  catch  them  The folio it seems read  latch  which appears to be the proper word and certainly signifies  catch  Thus in Piers Plowman so  As who so layeth lynes for to  latche  foules  As mr Steevens elsewhere tells us that he made it his busyness to restore ancient readings one might naturally have expected to see  latch  in the text  p  Mach  Then fly false thanes  And mingle with the  English epicures  "It  appears  " says mr Steevens in a note upon this passage "from dr Johnsons  Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland  that the natives had neither  kail  nor  brogues  till they were taught the arts of planting the one and making the other by the soldiers of Cromwell and yet" adds he  king James VI thought it necessary to form an act against superfluous banquetting  It is a pity that the ingenious commentator has omitted the very candid and liberal inference which the great traveler draws from the above circumstance of the kail  i e  that "when they had not  that  they had  nothing"  But under the favour of this ingenious critic it does  not appear  dr Johnson indeed is pleased to  say so  and they who would have believed him if he had given a relation  of his voyage into the moon may if they choose believe this It is very seldom that we find people teaching to others arts of which they are ignorant theirselves and yet this must have been the case with Cromwells soldiers who were accustomed neither to eat kail nor to wear brogues The truth is that both articles have in all probability been known to the Scotish ever since the country was inhabited So that they may safely admit the truth of the above very candid travelers goodnatured position  Mr Steevens seems to think it altogether needless to restrain luxury in diet where people could get neither  kail  nor  brogues  which to be sure are the very essence of a sumptuous feast  p  Mach  And with some sweet oblivious antidote  Cleanse the  foul  bosom of that perilous stuff  Which weighs upon the heart  Stuff'd  mr Steevens tell us is the reading of the old copy but for the sake of the  ear  which must be  shocked  by the recurrence of so harsh a sound he is  willing  to read  foul foul  is accordingly read And such is the method taken to preserve the authors genuine text Alas poor Shakspeare  VOLUME THE FIFTH  KING JOHN  p  K John  Be thou as  Eghtning  in the eyes of France  For ere thou canst report I will be there  The  thunder  of my cannon shall be heard  "This simile" dr Johnson observes "does not suit well the lightning indeed" adds he "appears before the thunder is heard but the lightning is destructive and the thunder innocent" The allusion may notwithstanding be very proper so far as Shakspeare has applyed it  i e  merely to the  swiftness  of the  lightening  and its  preceding  and  foretelling  the  thunder  But there is some reason to believe that  thunder  was not thought to be  innocent  in our authors time as we elsewhere learn from hisself Thus in  King Lear  You sulphurous and thought executing fires  Vaunt couriers to  oakrending thunderbolts  Again in  Antheny and Cleopatra  Some innocents scape not the  thunderbolt  Again in  Julius Caesar  I have walk'd about the streets  And thus unbraced Casea as you see  Have bar'd my bosom to the  thundersione  And still more decisively in  Measure for Measure

does not appear that Constance hereby means to call Austria  fool  as sir John Hawkins would have it but she certainly means to call him  coward  and to tell him that a  calfs skin  would suit his  recreant limbs  better than a  lions  They still say of a dastardly person that he is a  calfhearted  fellow and a runaway schoolboy is usually called a great  calf  p  Pand  For that which thou hast sworn to  do amiss  Is't not amiss  when it is  truly done  And  being not done  where  doing  tends to  ill  The  truth  is then  most done  not doing it  For this nonsense the reader is indebted to dr Johnsons  emendation  the old copies have it thus  Is  not amiss when it is truly done  Which dr Warburton calls the conclusion  de travers  he therefor reads  Is  yet  amiss  Sir Thomas Hanmer  most  amiss  But all these objections to and proposed alterations of the old reading arise entirely from its not being understood If the reader will consider the passage a moment he will perceive that it has sense and meaningis quite in the spirit of the cardinals quibbling logicand infinitely superior to any of these pretended emendations Pandulf having conjured the king to perform his first vow to heavento be champion of the churchtells him that what he has since sworn is sworn against hisself and therefor may not be performed by him for  that  says he which you have sworn to  do amiss  is  not amiss  i e becomes right when it is  done truely  that is as he explains it not done at all and being  not done  where it would be a  sin  to  do it  the  truth  is  most done  when you  do it not  So in  Loves Labour Lost  It is  religion  to be  thus forsworn  There is no difficulty in this but what the over busy critic chooses to make  "It is strange that when the sense is so clear any commentator should thus laboriously obscure it to introduce a new reading and yet stranger that he should shew such confidence in his emendation as to insert it in the text JOHNSON"  The learned critic seems to think hisself intitled to an exclusive privilege of corrupting the authors language  It is not with this writer alone that such injudicious freedoms have been taken Beaumont and Fletcher are equally indebted to the sense and judgement of their friendly editors One instance out of some hundreds may serve as a specimen In the  Faithful Shepherdess  Perigor describing a delightful bank says  Here never durst the babbling euckow  spit  Which last word the ingenious critic who unsettled the text in the late edition  to spit  not being as he believed a property of the cuckow very readyly changed to  sit  A variation which slight as it is entirely destroys the harmony of the passage and could onely have proceeded from a person equally ignorant of the authors language and inattentive to his ideas The whole description is confined to the purity of the turf and its freedom from every thing foul and venemous And lest the next editor of these poetical brothers should know no more of his duty than his immediate predecessor has done he is here told that in the North of England the white froth frequently observed on bushes plants and grass is believed by the vulgar to have a poisonous or venemous quality and is universally called the  Cuckows    p  Faul    Bell book  and  candle  shall not drive me back  The curse by bell book and candle is the solemn

hath made  His peace with Rome What is that peace to me  I by the honour of my marriage bed  After young Arthur claim this land for mine  In a preceding scene Pandulph tells Lewis that in case of Arthurs death he  ' in the right of lady Blanch his wife  Might then make all the claim that Arthur did'  This claim the dauphin now asserts and it is possible that Shakspeare imagined him to have the right he pretended But the fact is Arthur had left an infant sister Eleanor of Britain who was then right heir to the crown and  de jure  queen of England and who to the everlasting disgrace of this country languished all her days in obscurity and confinement and even supposing  her  out of the question John and his son Henry had a better title than Blanch who was onely that kings sisters daughter unless indeed he might be said to have forfeited all right by his unnatural cruelty to his nephew whom he is believed to have murdered with his own hands yet still even on that idea would young Henrys title remain unimpeached for neither then nor in our authors time was it understood that the personal misconduct of the ancestor could in any case bar the succession of the innocent issue A humane and righteous principle reserved for the discovery and practice of a more refined and liberal people in a more enlightened and politic age  p  Sal  New flight  And  happy newness  that intends  old right  "Happy innovation" quoth dr Johnson "that purposed the restoration of the ancient rightful government" What rightful government Does the good old constitutionalist suppose it to have been in John a murderer and a villain one who had not the least right to the possession of the crown and whom it would have been praiseworthy in any man or set of men to have put to death  RICHARD THE SECOND  p  Boling  Norsolkso  far as to mine enemy    Dr Johnson does not he says clearly see the sense of this abrupt line It is not therefor much to be wondered that he has not given a meaning which he could not find The old copies readingso  fare  "All the old copies read so  fare  STEEVENS" A mistake The second folio reads  so  farre  mr Tollet makes the speaker wish Norsolk to  fare  like his enemy A construction than which nothing can be more irrational and absurd Bolingbroke onely uses the phrase by way of caution lest Mowbray should think he was about to address him  as a friend  Norfolk says he so far as a man may speak to his enemy I  c  p  Boling  Thanks gentle uncleCome lords away  To fight with Glendower and his complices  This last line mr Theobald thought an  interpolation  and therefor threw it out of  his  edition and in this the editors have been weak enough to inclose it in brackets These proceedings are the more remarkable as supposing it genuine there does not appear any thing like a reason in mr Theobalds note for the charge he would make against Shakspeare of forgetfulness and inattention to history and a very strange charge it would be For it is evident from the preceding scene that there was a force in  Wales which Bolingbroke might think it necessary to suppress and why dr Johnson for  you  think the emendation just might not Shakspeare call it Glendowers When we next see Bolingbroke he is in Wales and mentions his having received intelligence that the Welshmen are dispersed  p  Queen  Gardiner for telling me these news of woe  I would the plants thou graft'st may never grow  An execration dr Johnson observes too ludicrous and unsuitable to the queens condition and it certainly appears so But perhaps for Shakspeares highest or lowest characters are never without a quibble she means to wish him  chidlless  It is to be remembered that the queen was very young dr Johnson will therefor the more readyly pardon any puerilities of expression he may find her guilty of  p  Fitzw  my  rapiers  point  Dr Johnson here takes an opportunity to censure Shakspeare for deserting the manners of the age in which his drama is placedthis weapon he says not being seen in England till two centuries aftewards It would be as well however though not quite so easy for the learned critic to bring some proof in support of this and such like assertions Without which the authority of Shakspeare is at least equal to that of dr Johnson And even if he could prove what he asserts which however it is believed he cannot the poets friends would still have an argument which would render both his assertions and his proofs equally nugatory and ridiculous  p  K Rich  My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar  Their  watches to mine eyes  The first folio says dr Johnson agrees with the third quarto which reads  My thoughts are minutes and with sighes they jarre  There  watches to mine eyes  This is not true The first folio which the learned critic was too indolent to consult reads  Their  watches  on unto  mine eyes  Which he has already given as the reading of the quarto of  p  R Rich  Now sir the  sound  that

more the  thirsty entrance of this soil  Shall  daub her lips  with  her own childrens blood  Dr Warburton calls these lines nonsense and would read  trempe  instead of  daub  or as it stood then  damp  Dr Johnson allows them to be absurd but objects to  trempe  and would change  entrance  to  entrails  adding that the relative  her  is inaccurately used in both readings He is likewise willing to suppose a verse lost Mr Steevens  not being satisfyed with either alteration proposes  entrants  instead of  entrance  and explains it by "those who set foot on this kingdom through the lust of power or conquest which was the kings own case" Never sure was there so much  drumbleing  nor except in this edition were there ever so many wild and absurd conjectures as this simple passage has given rise to For so simple it certainly is as that the little meaning it has may be easyly discovered by the most ignorant however  doctors  may differ about it The  thirsty entrance of the soil  is nothing more or less than the face of the earth parched and cracked as it always appears in a dry summer and mr Steevens came nearer the mark than he was aware of when he mentioned the  persus surface  of the ground As to its being personifyed it is certainly no such unusual practice with Shakspeare Every one talks familarly of  mother Earth  and they who live upon her face may without much impropriety be called her children Our author onely confines the image to his own country The allusion is to the  Barons wars  p  P Henry  As the honey of Hybla my  old lad of the castle  There is a very old and popular tradition that  old lad of the castle  alludes to the name of Sir John  Oldcastle  Falstaffs original surname when this play was first performed This mr Steevens will by no means allow But it is no matter there is as much reason argument and authority as can be well expected on one side of the question and his bare opinion on the other Fuller beside the words cited in the note has in his  Worthies  p the following passage  "Sir John  Oldcastle  was first made a  thrasonical puff  an emblem of  mock valour  a make sport in all  plays  for a  coward  "  Speed likewise in his Chronicle edit p says  "The author of the  Three Conversions  i e Parsons the Jesuit hath made  Oldcastle  a ruffian a robber and a rebel and his authority taken from the  stageplaye  s  is more befitting the pen of his slandcrous report than the credit of the judicious being only grounded from the papist and the poet of like conscience for lies the one ever seigning and the other ever falsifying the truth"  Both these quotations are immediately taken from an old number of the  Gentlemans Magazine  It is somewhat extraordinary for mr Steevens to assert that Shakspeare was not the author of the old play of Hen V in which Oldcastle appears to have been first introduced upon the stage No body ever said or thought he was But the very ingenious critic knows and allows that this same play afforded Shakspeare several hints among which were the name and character of  Sir John Oldcastle  whom he afterwards upon better advice called Sir John  Falst  ff  p  Hot  But soft I pray you did king Richard then  Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer  Heir to the crown  North  He did myself did hear it  It was not says mr Steevens Edmund Earl of March the Mortimer of this play whom K Richard II proclaimed heir to the crown but his father Roger earl of March who was killed soon after in Ireland  The learned commentator would have done well to consult the history before he ventured to be so decisive  Let us see when Northumberland heard this proclamation Why  then it was when the unhappy king  Set forth upon his Irish expedition  That Roger Mortimer could not be  then  proclaimed heir to the crown is evident from this plain and simple circumstanceHe was not then alive He had been treacherously killed by the wild Irish and it was chiefly to revenge his death that the king set out on this very expedition This proves it could not be  Roger  and that it was  Edmund  is proved by Hall who expressly says that HE "Edmond sonne to erle Roger" "at kyng Richardes goyng into Ireland was proclaimed heire apparant to the crowne and realme"  p    Car  An't be not four by the day I'll be hang'd  Charles' wain  is over the new chimney  Charleses wain  is the vulgar name

propriety of this explanation and supposes the expression may mean  fleas resembling a loach  i e the fish so called They must have been  elephantinelops  indeed to do this the loach being two or three  inches in length Besides this construction necessaryly requires the passage to have been  s  eas like  loaches The allusion is doubtless to the above  fish  and mr Steevens in the course of his extensive researches may one day find that it either has or was formerly supposed to have when dead the quality of producing fleas in abundance Dr Watburtons explanation if it may be so miscalled is almost too absurd to deserve contradiction The Scotch or Irish word  loch  a lake is a hard guttural sound which we have softened into  lough  e g  lough  vulgariter  lop    leeches  the physicians or

little reason and against all authority The modern editors noticing an omission make Bardolph to enter with Gadshill The learned critic calls this a countenancing of the impropriety and therefor  does not bring Bardolph on at all There is no absurdity in the passage except that of which the learned commentator is guilty Falstaffs calling out for Bardolph is no proof that he was within hearing The latters entrance should be marked and the old reading restored  p  Fal  Hang ye gorbellied knaves are ye undone No ye fat  chuffs  Mr Steevens is under a small mistake in supposing this word a

proceeded so much from the generous bravery of a noble and heroic mind as from a spirit of religious enthusiasm and a bigoted reliance on the P  esbyterian doctrine of Predestination which made it a matter of total indifference to him whether he left the field or remained in it The Highlander who slew him was not many years ago said to be living in the town of Perth  The representation therefor

p  Fal  If the fruit may be known by the tree as the tree by the fruit then there is virtue in that Falstaff  Mr Steevens is  afraid  that here is a profane allusion to the d verse of the th chapter of St Matthew Alas  and if the allusion were intentional where is its  profansness  p  Fal  Thou art essentially mad without seeming so  P Henry  And thou a natural coward without instinct  Fal  I deny your  major  if you will deny the  sheriff  so if not let him enter  c  Falstaff here intends a quibble which the editors industrious enough it must be confessed in pointing out such like things  Dr Johnson has unfortunately been too much so what imagination but his own would have discovered such a pun as either of the following  K Henry  Indeed the French may lay twenty  French crowns  to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders  "This conceit rather too low for a king has been already explained as alluding to the  venereal  disease"  And many such like  as's  of great charge  "  i e esses  heavily  loaded  A quibble is intended between  as  the conditional particle and  ass  the beast of burthen"  But to be sure the learned critic hath as Falstaff says  a strange alacrity in s  king  have suffered to escape their notice  Major  which  sheriff  brought to his mind signifies as well one of the parts of a logical propofit on as the principal officer of a corporation now called a  Mayor  p  Glend  For I was train'd up in the English court  Where being but young I framed to the harp  Many an English ditty lovely well  And  gave the tongue a helpful ornament  A virtue that was never seen in you  The tongue  i e says dr Johnson the English language He is wrong Glendower means that he graced his own tongue with the art of singing  p  Glend  She's desperate here  a peevish selfwill'd harlotry  Capulet in  Romeo and Juliet  speaking of his daughter has the same expression  A peevish selfwill'd harlotry it is  p  K Henry  The skipping king he ambled up and down  With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits  Soon kindled and soon burnt  carded his state  Mingled his royalty with carping fools  The metaphor  carded his state  is supposed by mr Steevens from a hint of mr Tollet and by dr Farmer to be taken from mingling  coarse wool  with  fine  and  carding them together  But this explanation is by much too far fetched and the learned critics may be justly said to have  sent their wits a woolgathering  in search of it By  carding his state  the usurper means that his predecessor set his consequence to hazard played it away as a man loses his fortune at  cards  p  K Hen  The archbishops grace of York Douglas Mortimer  Capitulate  against us and are up  i e  says mr Steevens  make head  against us Rather  combine confederate indent  To capitulate is  To draw up any thing in heads or articles  Johnsons Dictionary  These things 'tis true you have  articulated  p  Hot  He came but to be duke of Lancaster  To sue his livery  and beg his peace  To  sue his livery  mr Steevens says is a law phrase meaning to sue out the possession of his lands from the  Court of Wards  The  Court of Wards  did not exist till the d year of king  Henry the Eighth  before which time Wardships were usually granted as courtfavours to those who made suit for and had interest enough to obtain them  p  Wor  And being fed by us you us'd us so  As that ungentle gull the cuckows bird  Useth the sparrow  That is as dr Johnson very learnedly observes the cuckows  chicken  who says he being hatched and fed by the sparrow r the hedge sparrow in whose nest the cuckows egg was laid grows in time able to devour his nurse  Such indeed is the old popular superstition But the curious reader will find the honour and reputation of the cuckow and her said  chicken  so elegantly personifyed by the learned commentator ably desended by the ingenious mr Daines Barrington in his late useful and entertaining Miscellany  SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH  p  K Hen  Stay and breathe awhile  Thou hast redeem'd  thy  lost opinion  Should we not readmy  lost opinion  p  Mort  And  more and less  do flock to follow him  More  and  less  mr Steevens says means  greater and less  Not in this place It is simply  large and small numbers  p  Fal  You  huntcounter  hence avaunt  Huntcounter  says dr Johnson that is  blunderer  Rather you  base tyke  you  worthless dog  There can be no reason why Falstaff should call the servant a  blunderer  but he seems very anxious to prove him a  rascal  Mr Steevenses quotations would have been more germane to the matter if they had exhibited  huntcounter  as a  substantive  For it is not impossible that after all the word may be found to signify a  catchpole  or  bumbailif  He was probably the judge's  tipstaff  p  Fal  Very well my lord very well  In the quarto edition printed in this speech mr Theobald informs us stands thus  Old  Very well my lord very well  Mr Steevens still remains  unconvin  ed  and adds that  Old  MIGHT  have been  the  beginning  of  some actors name  An objection which would have served equally well if the name of  Oldcastle  had in that edition stood at length instead of  Falstaff  throughout the whole play The learned critics heterodoxical obduracy increases in proportion to the blaze of gospel evidence on the other side which must enforce conviction upon every mind not predetermined to think otherwise  p  Poins  the worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother and that I am a  proper fellow of my hands  and these two things I confess I cannot help  A tall or proper fellow of his hands says dr Johnson was a stout fighting man  In this place however  a proper fellow of his hands  means a good looking well made personable man Poins might certainly have helped his being a  fighting  fellow  p  Fal  On seeing the prince and Poins disguised as waiters  Ha a bastard son of the king's and art not thou  Poins his brother  His  brother whose brother the kings or his bastard sons Astonishing that the editors did not perceive the absurdity of printing or at least pointing the passage thus  And art not thou  Poins his  brother    i e  Poinses  brother  or brother to Poins a vulgar corruption of the genitive case  p  K Hen  We would dear lords unto the Holy Land  Dr Johnson is very fond of giving the reader continual information that the play proceeds in one unbroken tenor through the first editionthat there is therefor no evidence that the division of the acts was made by the authour and that since every editor has the same right to mark the intervals of action as the players who made the present distribution he would propose to change them so and so  When a division has been made by mr Rowe  any of his successors an editor has certainly a good right to change it if he can for the better But there is little room to doubt that the pauses of action marked in the first folio have been intended or at least approved by the author The player editors divided the different dramas just as they were  broken in the representation  And most if not all of Shakspeares plays having been performed at his own theatre and under his own eye it is very improbable that he should not have given directions about the division of the acts If there had been no distinction of acts in the playhouse copies messieurs Hemings and Condell would never have troubled their heads about the matter No editor has therefor any right to alter that division which is established by the two first folios unless in two or three places where the misplacing of the  actus  is too glaringly absurd to admit a doubt of its impropriety  p  Shal  Will Squele a  Cotswold man  i e  says mr Steevens one versed in the gymnastic exercises and consequently of a daring spirit and an athletic constitution I suppose continues he the following passage contains an  allusion  of the  same kind  By my faith ye are wont to be as bold  As yt were  a lyon of Cottyswold  Again  You old stale ruffin you  lyon of Cotsoll  It is rather unlucky that the ingenious commentator did not comprehend the force of this expression A  lyon of Cotswold  is a  sheep  p  Shal  The same sir JohnI saw him break  Skogans  head at the court gate  Who  Scogan  was mr Steevens says may be understood from a passage in  the Fortunate Isles  a masque by Ben Jonson    Scogan  what was he  Oh a fine gentleman and a master of arts  Of  Henry the Fourths time  that made disguises  For the kings sons and writ in ballad royal  Daintily well  c  And adds that among the works of Chaucer is a poem called "  Scogan  unto the lordes and gentilmen of the king's house"  But  this  is not the Scogan alluded to by Shallow He means the Scogan who was a jester mime mimic or courtfool in Edward the Fourths reign Mr Steevens knows  Scogans Jes  s  That is the man As to the point of chronology it is not worth consideration  p  Fal  For you Mouldy  stay  at home till you are past service  Dr Farmer seems right in his conjecture that this passage should be read  For you Mouldy  you have stay'd  at home 'till you are past service  The same ingenious and learned critic whom every lover of hakspeare literature and truth must always regard with the utmost gratitude and respect observes that there is some mistake in the number of  recruits  Shallow says that Falstaff should have  four  there but he appears to get but  three  Wart Shadow and FeebleIt is very trueFalstaff on his entrance asks the justices if they have provided him  half a dozen  sufficient men Shal  ow answers in the affirmative But onely  five  are produced And when Falstaff  says  Is here all  Shallow tells him  there is  two  more called than your number you must have but  four  here  So that there is certainly a  man missing  Is this now irretrieveable loss to be charged upon Shakspeare or the players  p  Shal  Yea marry  William cook  bid him come hither  It appears from this instance mr Steevens thinks that anciently the lower orders of people had no surnames but in their stead were content to adopt the titles of their several professions An inserence and conclusion which may with equal justice and propriety be made by some critic commenting a couple of centuries hence upon the dramatic pieces of the present period on meeting with the titles of  Robin coachman  and  John hosteler  p  Ch Just  And  struck me  in the very seat of judgment  Sir John Hawkins subjoins an account of the insult given to the speaker by prince Henry from Sir Thomas Elyot But mr Malone observes that there is no mention in it of the princes having  struck  him "Speed however" adds he "who quotes Elyot says  on I know not what authority  that the prince gave the judge a blow on the face" That this most learned gentleman may for the future  know on what authority  Speed made the assertion he has an opportunity to peruse the following extract  "For imprisonmente of one of his prince Henrys wanton mates and vnthriftie plaifaiers he  strake the chiefe Justice with his fiste on the face  For which offence he was not onely committed to streyght prison but also of his father put out of the

anonymous play  p  Sil  Singing  Do me right and dub me knight Saningo  Is't not so  He means according to Hanmer to say  San Domingo  An observation highly applauded by the reverend mr Thomas Warton who is to be sure from his extraordinary skill in the tongues perfectly well qualifyed to judge of its propriety But the truth is that the Spaniards though they use  San Pedro San Juan  c never either write or say  San Tomas  or  San Domingo  Mr Steevens has very happyly quoted an old catch ending  do me right  And dub me knight  Domingo  Which is the identical scrap that Silence is singing he therefor certainly means to say  Domingo  but being  fap  as Bardolph hath it  conclusions  pass the  careires  VOLUME THE SIXTH  KING HENRY THE FIFTH  p  Cant  the lady  Lingare  Daughter to

Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorain  The worth  ninth  has been inserted by some of the modern editors The old copies read  tenth  No notice is however taken of any variation in the margin of the present edition And yet  ninth  is certainly wrong and  tenth  certainly right Isabel was the wife of Philip the Second  father  of Lewis the  Ninth  and  grandfather  of Lewis the  Tenth  p  K Hen  May I with right and conscience make this claim  Cant  The sin upon my head dread sovereign  Notwithstanding the learned prelate is so confident in his opinion and so zealous to engage the king in a war with France and to cause such a deluge of Christian blood it will not be improper for the readers of this play to reflect that he had no more right to the throne of that kingdom than Charles VI had to the crown of England Henry proposes the invasion and conquest of France in prosecucution of the dying advice of the usurping Machiavel his father  to  busy giddy minds  With  foreign quartels  that action thence borne out  Might  waste the memory of the former days  That his subjects might have sufficient employment to mislead their attention from the nakedness of his own title The archibishop and clergy it appears had a similar reason for urging it  p  K Hen  We never valu'd this poor seat of England  And therefore  living hence  did give ourself  To barbarous licence as 'tis ever common  That men are merriest when they are from home  But tell the DauphinI will keep my state  Be like a king and shew my sail of greatness  When I do rouse me in my throne of France  It is evident that the word  hence  implies  here  Sir Thomas Hanmer was however to blame for making it so No one who reads Shakspeare or indeed any other old writer can be ignorant in what strangely lax and arbitrary senses  many other words are used The king says that as he had lived from  home  i e  his throne of France  in a place he did not esteem he had been careless to observe the dignity and behaviour of a great king  Dr Warburton explains it to be  living as if he were absent from England  mr Steevens  withdrawing from court  p  Nym  Good morrow  lieutenant Bardolph  It would be some satisfaction to learn how Bardolph acquired his  commission  he was no more than Falstaffs  corporal  when we last parted with him and in act II scene ii Nym addresses him by the  same title  which mr Steevens there says is a mistake for  lieutenant  That gentleman therefor is perhaps able to give the desired information  p  Nym  when time shall serve there shall be  smiles  Dr Warburton suspects smiles to have been a stage direction Mr Steevens explains it thushe should be merry even though he were to lose Pistols friendship or that his face would be ready with a smile as often as occasion should call one out into service though Pistol who had excited so many was no longer near him It is not always an easy matter to discover the  humour  of Nyms expressions but from the tenour of his discourse one would think he meant that when opportunity came he would take a pleasant revenge that he would when he caught Pistol sleeping cut his throat and smile  p  Bard  Good  lieutenant  good corporal offer nothing here  Mr Steevens observes we should read  Good  ancient for it is Pistol to whom he addresses himself It is very true and what is Pistol Falstaff whom one may suppose to have been at least as well acquainted with his rank as the ingenious commenator can be has already addressed him by the same title  "Fear no colours go with me to dinner Come  lieutenant Pistol  come Bardolph"  And in act III of the present play Fluellen calls him  an ancient  lieutenant  Ibid  Pist  Pish for thee  Iceland  dog thou prickear'd cur of  Iceland  The old reading was  Island  and  Island  seems to be right It is the proper name of the country The difficulty arose from the commentators not understanding the right pronunciation And it may be here observed in passing that the common English word should be always written  iland  the  s  being not only expletive and useless but unnatural and absurd The same observation will apply to the word  viscount  unless it should be thought better to write and pronounce it  vicecount  p  Quick  his nose was as sharp as a pen and 'a  babbled of green fields  Here is a number of profound annotations on this passage of which the use is not very apparent That note of Theobalds which dr Johnson affects to say he omits  in pity to his readers  is not onely a better but a more interesting one than any in the page and was peculiarly necessary as it established the adopted reading A mr  Smith  seems to write with a good deal of confidence why do not  we meet him oftener or rather why have we met him at all  p  Pist  Let housewif'ry appear keep close I thee command  Mr Steevens whose note on this passage it would not be proper to transcribe has elsewhere observed that on some occasions silence is less reprehensible than information and it would perhaps have been as well if he had still continued of the same opinion and omitted to acquaint us with the indecent reading of the old quartos and spared his equally indecent quotations and comments more especially as every reader ignorant of this precious piece of information would take the text to imply as it does no more than a charge to  keep within doors  and further as it doth not appear on looking into  Philotus  that the word adduced by the learned commentator either has or can by the utmost stretch of ingenuity be made to bear in that play any such meaning as he here seems so desirous of forcing upon it  p  Exe  He'll call you to so hot an answer for it  That caves and womby vaultages of France  Shall  chide  your trespass  "  Shall  hide  your

restored  chide  from the quarto I have therefore inserted it in the the textSTEEVENS"  All these gentlemen have boasted of their fidelity and care in collating the old editions The two first cannot at present be spoke with But one may surely venture to ask dr Johnson and mr Steevens  what the folios read  p  Flu  Up to the preaches you rascals will you not up to the preaches  Pist  Be merciful  great duke  to men of mould  Great duke  what duke Fluellen Indeed his grace is infinitely obliged to the generosity of our editorial Brentford Sovereigns for the honour they have been so graciously pleased to confer upon him A  Welsh captain  created a  duke  Good It is not fit however that Shakspeares dignities should be thus prostituted at the  mere motion  and  special grace  of every  usurper  Perhaps the next  Phys  or  Ush  that obtrudes hisself upon the dramatic throne may take it into his head to create ancient  Pistol  a  viscount  But the  peerage  of  Shakspeare  must not be so  degraded  We shall therefor forthwith institute an enquiry into the disposal of the above  dukedom  Up to the preaches  c Thus says mr Steevens the to The folio adds he reads  up to the breach you dogges avaunt you cullions  But neither does this variation lessen the absurdity of Pistols calling Fluel'en a duke  The  quart  reads  Flucilens  speech as in the text and  Nym  answers him thus  Abate thy rage  sweet knight  abate thy rage  No mention is made of any duke  The fact is that in the folio it is the  duke of Exeter  and not Eluellen who enters and to whom Pistol addresses hisself Shakspeare had made the alteration and the  player editors inserted it in the text but inadvertently left Fluellen in possession of the margin This was an incongruity which might one would think have been easyly perceived and quickly remedyed but the present editors by taking  Fluellens  speech from the quarto and  Pistols  from the folio have increased the confusion and absurdity of the text a thousand fold and thus it has come to pass that the former is created a duke  If such like kings be fit to govern speak  p  Flu  Fortune is painted plind  c  This picture of Fortune dr Farmer tells us is taken from the old history of  Fortunatus  But is dr Farmer quite certain that this history had made its appearance in an English dress so early as Shakspeares time Surely Fortune is  painted plind  in many other books much more ancient and equally common  p  Pist  Die and be damn'd and  figo  for thy friendshipThe  fig  of Spain  An allusion mr Steevens observes to the custom of giving poison'd figs to those who were the objects of Spanish or Italian revenge But the expression both here and afterwards is evidently used by Pistol as a term of  contempt  and cannot have any relation either to poisoning or to revenge Whether to the  fico  indeed explained in the  Merry Wives of Windsor  may be doubtful  p  Cho  The poor condemned English  Sit  patiently and inly  ruminate  The morning

fear take from them now  The sense of reckoning  if  the opposed numbers  Pluck their hearts from them  The old copies read  take from them now  The sense of reck'ning  of  th' opposed numbers  Pluck their hearts from them  The poet says Theobald might intend "take from them the sense of reckoning those opposed numbers  which  might pluck their courage from them" But the  relative  adds he not being expressed the sense is very obscure  This change according to dr Johnson is rightly admitted by bishop Warburton Sir Thomas Hanmer it seems reads  the opposed numbers  Which stand before them  This reading dr Johnson says he borrowed from the old quarto which gives the passage thus  Take from them now the sense of reckoning  That the opposed multitudes that stand before them  May not appall their courage  Mr Tyrwhitt allows that Theobalds alteration makes a very good sense but he thinks that we might read with  less deviation from the old edition what is adopted in the present text  After all the old reading appears to be right though none of the commentators has attempted to explain it The king prays that his men may be unable to reckon the enemys force that their hearts  i e  their sense and passions may be taken from them  that they may be as brave as a total absence of all feeling and reflection can make them  Junius  An explanation which seems to be countenanced by the old to  A learned friend inclines to think that bytheir  hearts  the king means the hearts  of the opposed numbers  p  K Hen  More will I do  Though  all  that I can do is nothing worth  Since that my penitence  comes after all  Imploring pardon  This reading is certainly right though not properly explained by dr Johnson It is simply thusAll that I can do is of no avail since when I have done every thing I can I must still rely on my own penitence for obtaining the pardon of my fathers misdeeds The first part of dr Warburtons note is singularly just It is indeed a mockery of Heaven in Henry to expect pardon for a crime of which he continued to enjoy the benefit And certainly if ever the divine judgement ought to have interfered or did actually interfere in visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children it was in this very case of the house of Lancaster  p  Pist  Yield cur  Fr Sol  Je pense que vous efles le gentilhomme de bonne qualité  Pist  Quality  call you me  Construe me art

should still be thought necessary to amend the text the readyest way would be to omit a syllable and readin  plows  p  K Henry  Give me  thy  glove soldier look here is  the fellow of it  It must be says dr Johnson  give me  my  glove  for of the soldiers glove the king had not the fellow The passage is notwithstanding like most of those the doctor objects to perfectly right  Give me  thy  glove soidier  i e that which thou hast in thy cap and of  that  the king had certainly the fellow  p  K Henry  such a plain king  "I know not" says dr Johnson "why Shakspeare now gives the king nearly such a character as he made him formerly  ridicule  in  Percy  " It would be much less difficult for the reader to remove the cause of the learned commentators ignorance than it would be for  him  to point out the passage in which  Percy  is  ridiculed  FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH  p  Bur  Myself  Am sure I scar'd the dauphin and his  trull  Mr Steevens believes that  trull  did not anciently bear so harsh an interpretation as it does at present An opinion for which the learned commentator does not seem to have sufficient authority In Shakspeares time and long before it signifyed a  strumpet  a  harlot  as it evidently does in the text Neither will the single instance brought by mr  Steevens prove the contrary In the ancient morality of  The iiij elements  a fellow says  For to satisfy your wanton lust  I shall apoynt you a  trull  of trust  Nor a fairer in this towne  Again in the old mayg  me of  Robin Hode  She is a  trul  of trust to ferve a fryer at his lust  It is to be regretted that Shakspeare should have so far followed the absurd and lying stories of his time about this celebrated heroine whom the French called the maid of God as to represent her not onely a strumpet but a witch If we may believe the most authentic historians she was no less distinguished for virtue than courage She was burnt indeed by the barbarous English whom she had so frequently driven before her and who to excuse their want of courage or policy and to justify their inhumanity pretended that she had dealt with the devil But her memory will no doubt be long held in deserved veneration by her grateful countrymen whom she so largely contributed to rescue from usurpation and slavery And it is not the least praise of our elegant historian mr Hume that he has endeavoured to do justice to the much injured character of this amiable brave wise and patriotic female  The dauphin too whom we are apt to look upon as a traitor a coward and a scoundrel was perhaps the greatest character of the age he lived in He was one of the best kings France ever had and England never had a better  p  Pla  t  He bears him on the  place's privilege  "The Temple" dr Johnson observes "being a  reli    was an asvlum a place of exemption from  revenge and bloodshed"  The learned commentator deals more in words than in knowlege The Temple was then as it is now the residence of students in the law And it is not unlikely that the orders of the society prohibited quarreling and blows under certain penalties  p  A room in the Tower Enter  Mortimer  brought in a chair and jailors  Mr Edwards in his MS notes says mr Steevens observes that Shakspeare has varyed from the truth of history to introduce this scene between Mortimer and Richard Plantagenet Edmund Mortimer served under Henry V in and dyed unconfined in Ireland in  The truth of this charge should have been established by some better authority than the dictum of mr Edwards adopted by mr Steevens In the third year of Henry the sixth and during the time that Peter duke of Coimbra was entertained in London "Edmonde Mortymer" says Hall "the last erle of Marche of that name which longe tyme had bene restrayned frō hys liberty and fynally waxed lame disceased wythout yssue whose inheritance discended to lord Richard Plantagenet  c  "  This authority even if the fact were otherwise is sufficient to protect Shakspeare against the charge of having varyed from the truth of history to introduce the scene  p  K Hen  When I was young as yet I am not old  I do remember  how my father said  A stouter champion

plausible enough but would rather have the speech corrupted further broken thus  And ifI wishhe did  or perhaps  And if he did I wish  Such nonsense as no one but dr Johnson would have been confident enough to produce and which not even dr Johnson could understand To mr Steevens we are certainly indebted for a very useful additional letter the old copies onely reading  I  wis But it is really astonishing that men of so much learning sense and sagacity for they certainly have in many places displayed a great deal of each should so grossly misconceive the meaning of so plain and simple a passage York says he is not pleased that the king should prefer  the  red rose  the badge of Somerset his enemy Warwick desires him not to be offended at it as he dares say the king  meant no harm  To which York yet unsatisfyed hastyly adds in a menacing tone  If I thought he did  but he instantly checks his threat with  let it rest  It is an example of a rhetorical figure which every one knows and which our author has elsewhere used Thus in  Coriolanus  An 'twere to give againBut 'tis no matter  Mr Steevens is too familiar with Virgil not to recollect his  Quos egoSed motos praes  at componere fluctus  If the passage would not have explained itsself one should think that Exeters soliloquy immediately following Yorks speech might have served to do it  It is but justice to say that the truely ingenious author of the  Revisal  understood this passage in the same manner and the neglect he has received at the hands of the late editors who have made little other use of his book than merely to pick out a few conjectures to cavil at does no more credit to them than it has done service to their author  p  York  And I am  lowted  by a traytor villain  A  lout  is a country fellow a clown He

Spirit  The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose  But  him out live  and  die a violent death  The meaning of this perplexed and aenigmatical reply seems to be The duke is living who shall depose

marryed to Owen Glendowers daughter in the  First part of king Henry IV  Is it possible that the authors memory should have so much deceived him that he could not remember in one play what he had already written in another  p  Q Mar  two pulls at once  His lady banish'd and a limb lopp'd off  This staff of honour  raught  There let it stand  The word  raught  seems to have some other meaning in this place than  reached  e g  reft  or violently torn from him The point at the end of the second line should be a comma The  limb lopp'd off  certainly alludes to the loss of his office The full stop should be after  raught  p  Suff  My lord these faults are  easy  quickly answer'd  Easy  dr Johnson says is slight inconfiderable as in other passages of this author It would have been well to have produced one or two of those  other passages  but that perhaps might have been  difficult  The word no doubt means  easyly  p  Suf  that is good deceit  Which  mates  him first that first intends deceit  Mates  him says bishop Percy meansthat first puts an end to his moving To  mate  adds he is a term in chess used when the king is stopped from moving and an end put to the game The learned prelate follows Dogberrys advice and lets his writing and reading appear  when there is no need of such vanity Mates  him in the text means  confounds  him from  amatir  or  mater  French To  mate  is no term in chefs with which one would have supposed the ingenious annotator more intimate  Checkmate  the term he alludes to is a corruption of the Persian  Schah mat  the king is killed There can be no better evidence that Shakspeare was entirely unacquainted with the game of chess than his not having at least to the writers remembrance the most distant allusion to it As he does not appear to have read a single book or known a single art or science or indeed any thing else from which he did not some how or other contrive to introduce into his plays all the information images or ideas they had supplyed him with Chess would have been an inexhaustible fund and kings and warriors would have been  checkmated  in every play  p  K Henry  I thank thee  Well  these words content me much  The old copies read  I thank thee  Nell  these words content me much  This says mr Theobald is king Henrys reply to his wife Margaret There can be no reason adds he why the king should forget his own wises name and call her Nell instead of Margaret As the change of a single letter he thought set all right he was willing to suppose it came from his pen thus  I thank thee  Well  these words content me much  And this the editors have adopted without further enquiry That the queens name was  Margaret  and not  Eleanor  is an allowed fact But that the king should forget it is not at all surprising as in the progress of the scene we find that she forgets it  herself  calling herself  Eleanor  no less than three times in one speech Of this however it should seem that mr Theobald has not taken any notice at least none is taken of it in this edition which every where reads  Margaret  The change in the three instances alluded to was certainly requisite and the same necessity and the same reasoning which displaced  Eleanor  and inserted  Margaret  must in the passage under consideration displace  Nell  and insert  Meg  p  Suf  Obscure and  lowly  swain king Henrys blood  The quarto mr Steevens observes reads  lowsy  swain From which we are doubtless to infer that the present edition agrees with the folio But unfortunately for the inference the folio does not differ from the quarto  p  Suff  Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate  Mr Tollet is accurate in his reference to Co  grave but Co  grave is mistaken The name of the giant alluded to  was  Fierabras  Cotgrave had

is  c  Lent shall be as long as it is  Methinks says dr Johnson it might be read more humorously  Lent shall be as long  again  as it is  "This emendation thus impressed with all the power of his eloquence 'dr Johnson' found in the" old quarto and two first folios all "which he professes to have seen"  This is far from being a singular instance of the learned critics producing the reading of the old copies as his own conjectures So in  Henry V  act V scene ii  " like a married wife about her husbands neck Every  wife  is a  married wife  I suppose we should read  newmarried  an epithet more expressive of fondness JOHNSON"  "The solio reads a  newmarried  wise STEEVENS"  p  Cade  Iden farewell and  be proud of thy victory  tell Kent from me she hath lost her best man and exhort all the world to be cowards for I that never fear'd any am vanquish'd by famine not by valour  Iden  How much  thou wrong'st me  heaven be my judge  That is says dr Johnson in supposing that I am proud of my victory Certainly not because Cade does not tell him he  is  proud of his victory but onely bids him  be so  He wrongs him in attributing his own death to  famine  and not to  Idens valour  p  Fields near  Saint Albans But why  Saint Albans  Hall who it may be supposed knew as much about the matter as the editors and Hollinshed after him expressly says that the duke of York was encamped on "brētheath a mile from Dertford in Kent and x miles from Londō" and that the kings army lay upon Blackheath And there is no reason to believe that Shakspeare meant in this instance at least to deviate from the history though he has certainly so either by inadvertency or design in making Buckingham the messenger he was indeed sent to York on a different occasion  i e  immediately before the battle of Saint Albans but the bishops of Winchester and Ely were the ambassadors on this  p  York  Call hither to the stake my two brave  bears  Bid  Salisbury  and  Warwick  come to me  "The Nevils earls of Warwick" says sir John Hawkins "had a  bear and a ragged staff  for their cognizance  but  the  Talbots  who were formerly earls of  Shrewsbury  had a  lion  and the present earl  of  Talbot a descendant of that family has the same"  All this sir John Hawkins may be very true but will you just give us leave to askwhat it is to the purpose  THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH  p  York  Lord  Clifford  and lord Stafford all abreast  Charg'd our main battles front and breaking in  Were  by the swords of common soldiers slain  It is the more extraordinary that York should be made to say this as in the last scene but one of the immediately preceding play he kills Clifford upon the stage with his own hand  p  K Henry  Richard in the view of many lords  Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth  York  He rose against him being his sovereign  And made him to resign the crown perforce  War  Suppose my lords he did it unconstrain'd  Think you 'twere  prejudicial to the crown  Exe  No for he could not so resign the crown  But that the next heir should succeed and reign  Dr Johnson thought we should rather read  prejudicial to his  son  to his  next heir which is strangely absurd Mr Steevens says  prejudicial to the crown  means  to the prerogative of the crown  an exposition in which he is certainly right if by  prerogative of the crown  he mean  its indefeasible hereditary descent  The reader will recollect that  this  was a  Revolution parliament  though diametrically opposite in its principles and practice to one Shakspeare never heard of which unhappyly for this country contributed as much to destroy the constittuion as that he here describes did to preserve it  p  Gab  The queen with all the northern earls and lords  Intend here to besiege you in your castle  This intelligence is given to York just after he has determined from the arguments of his sons Edward and Richard to break his oath of peace to the king and obtain immediate possession of the crown by force  "I know not" says dr Johnson "whether the author intended any moral instruction but he that reads this has a striking admonition against that precipitancy by which men often use unlawful means to do that which a little delay would put honestly in their power Had York staid but a few moments he had saved his cause from the stain of perjury"  It will be no more than justice to York if we recollect that this scene so far as respects the oath and his resolution to break it proceeds entirely from the authors imagination Neither the earl of March nor Richard was then at Sandal the latter being likewise a mere child scarcely more than if indeed so much as nine years old His appearance therefor and actions in this and the last acts of the present and at least the two first of the following play are totally unsupported by history and truth  p  Enter Rutland and  his tutor  "A priest called sir R  bert Aspall"  Hall Hen VI fo  p  Rut  I never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me  Clif  Thy father hath  Rut  But 'twas ere I was born  Rutland is under a mistake The battle of St Albans in which old Clifford was slain happened in that of Wakefield in He appears to have been at this time above seventeen years old  p  York  Oh  tygres  heart wrapp'd in a womans hide  This is a remarkable instance of the editors diffidence The word appears in the same shape in the old editions and the present editors not knowing whether it was intended for  tygers  or  tygress's  durst not venture to change it and have therefor left it as they found it We should however certainly read  tygress'  p  Edw  when came  George  from  Burgundy  to  England  War  he was lately  sent  From your kind aunt duchess of Burgundy  With aid of soldiers to this needful war  This circumstance is not warranted by history Clarence and Gloucester as they were afterwards created were sent into Flanders immediately after the battle of Wakefield and did not return untill their brother Edward got possession of the crown Besides Clarence was not now more than twelve years old  Isabel dutchess of Burgundy whom Shakspeare calls the dukes aunt was daughter of John I king of Portugal by Philippa of Lancaster eldest daughter of John of Gaunt They were therefor no more than third cousins  p  Rich  Whoever got thee there thy mother stands    Rich  Iron of Naples hid with English gilt  The first of these speeches is in the folios by an evident blunder given to  Warwick  The latter which is there given to  Richard  seems more properly to belong to  Warwick  p  A field of battle  at Ferrybridge  in Yorkshire  We should read  near Towton  Shakspeare has here perhaps intentionally thrown three different actions into one The lord Fitzwater being stationed by king Edward to defend the pass of Ferrybridge was assaulted by the lord Clifford and immediately slain "and with hym" says Hall "the hastard of Salisbury brother to the earl of Warwycke a valeaunt yong gen  elman and of great audicitie When the earl of Warwycke" adds he "was informed of this seate he lyke a man desperated mounted on his hackeney and came blowing to kyng Edwarde saiyng syr I praye God haue mercy of their soules which in the beginning of your enterprise hath lost their lyfes and because I se no succors of the world I remit the vengeaunce and punishment to God our creator and redenier and with that lighted doune and slewe his horse with his swourde saiyng let them flye that wyl for surely I wil tary with him that wil tary with me and kissed the crosse of his swourde" Clifford in his retreat was beset with a party of Yorkists when "eyther" says the historian "for heat or payne putting off his gerget sodainly with an arrowe as some say without an hedde he was striken into the throte and incontinent rendered his spirite and the erle of Westmerlandes brother and almost all his company were thare slayn at a place called Dintingdale not farr frō Towton" In the afternoon of the next day Palm Sunday eve on a plain field between Towton and Saxton joined the main battles  which continued engaged that night and the greater part of the following day upwards of men all English including many of the nobility and the flower of the gentry especially of the northern parts being slain on both sides This battle says Carte "decided the fate of the house of Lancaster overturning in one day an usurpation strengthened by sixtytwo years continuance and established Edward on the throne of England"  p  A wood in  Lancashire  Why  Lancashlre  The king says  From Scotland am I stol'n even of pure love  To greet mine own land with my wishful sight  Which proves that he can neither have been long out of the former country nor have got far into the latte Indeed that this was the fact appears from Hall who tells us "He was no sooner entered but he was knowen and taken of one Cantlow and brought towarde the kyng" A future editor will therefor do well to read  Northhumberland  p  Glo  And

 unlcok'd for issue  could no more  of right place theirselves between Clarence and him than between Edward and Clarence  p  Enter Warwick  at the French court This noblemans embassy and commission the insult he receives by the kings hasty marriage and his consequent resolution to avenge it with the capture imprisonment and escape of the king Shakspeare it is true found in Hall and Hollinshed but later as well as earlyer writers of better authority incline us to discredit the whole and to refer the rupture between the king and his political creator to causes which have not reached posterity or to that jealousy and ingratitude so natural perhaps to those who are under obligations too great to be discharged  Beneficia  says Tacitus  eo usque loeta sunt dum videntur exsolvi posse

gentlemen who took upon them to make the transposition of which they have not by the way been pleased to give the slightest intimation just knew that StonyStratford was a stage nearer London than Northhampton and that was all Had they condescended to consult the history they would have found that the prince and his company did in their way to London actually lye at  StonyStratford  one night and were the next morning taken back by the duke of Gloucester to  Northhampton  where they lay the following night See Hall Ed V fo  p  Queen  A  parlous boy  Go to you are too shrewd  Dutch  Good

the change And thus are the words and meaning of Shakspeare altered corrupted and injured through the indolence and presumption of his editors and commentators The old editions not onely give the question to the archbishop but make it plain that the messenger speaks to no other person They read  Is all unknown to me my gracious  lord  p  Gle  Touch'd you the bastardy of Edwards children  Buck

former passage that these two clergymen here called bishops were Dr  Shaw  and  Friar Penker  Gloucester tells Buckingham  you shall find me well accompanied  With  reverend fathers  and well learned  bishops  And Catesby has just informed him that the duke is  within with  two right reverend fathers  i e  the two bishops between whom he appears above Dr Shaw and friar Penker were the  reverend fathers  p  K Rich  The son of Clarence have I  pen'd up close  In Sheriffhutton castle where he remained till the coming of Henry VII who immediately after the battle of Bosworth sent him to the Tower and some few years after most treacherously and barbarously put him to death being from a total want of education and commerce with mankind so ignorant that he could not according to Hall discern a goose from a  apon With this unfortunate young nobleman ended the male line of the illust  ious house of Plantagenet  his daughter  meanly have I match'd in marriage  To sir Richard Pole

support of it is so The truth is that Shakspeare makes Heaven a  person  p  K Rich  What  heir of York  is there alive but we  What  heir of York  i e  What son of Richard duke of York  p  Richm  O

closely followed has  "  brought up by my  mothers  means and mine  " That Hollinshed copies verbatim from Hall but by an error of the press gives  moother  instead of  brother  as it is in Hall and ought to be in Shakspeare The learned commentators ingenuity is unquestionable though it has involved him in some little inconsistency For if  mother  which Shakspeare certainly wrote should be changed to  brother  because he was misled by the blunder of Hollinsheds printer why is the word  praeclarissimus  to be justifyed by the identical principle on which mother is condemned  Hen V  volume v p  p  Rich  O now let  Richmond  and  Elizabeth  The  true succeeders of each royal house  By God's fair ordinance conjoin together  Shakspeare is not singular in supposing Henry to be the true representative of the line of Lancaster The tyrannous and bloody disposition of this monarch and his immediate successor neither of whom was at all inferior in cruelty and the first of them far superior in craft and cunning to the monster he dethroned joined to the goodness of their title under the house of York made it unsafe and perhaps unnecessary to canvas his descent So that fear flattery neglect and ignorance seem to have established the opinion which most of our historians and people in general hold of Richmonds being what he here pretends to be But he is an impostor his great grandfather John duke of Somerset from whom he derived the little title he had was bastard son to John of Gaunt and though legitimated by act of parliament as to other purposes utterly incapable of inheriting the crown The right heir of the house of Lancaster which indeed as opposed to the line of York had not the smallest legal pretensions to the throne was  then and still is in the royal family of Portugal in virtue of its descent from the lady Philippa eldest daughter to John of Gaunt  KING HENRY THE EIGHTH  p  Buck  his own letter  The honourable board of council out  Must fetch in

the learned commentator brings this merely to display his want of it For let the word  hazienda  signify what it may what has it to do here Indeed "the professed critic in order to furnish his quota to the bookseller may write  notes of nothing  that is notes which either explane things which do not want explanation or such as do not explane matters at all but merely fill up so much paper" a canon of which dr Johnson has availed hisself pretty much in the manner of his predecessor dr Warburton who sagaciously observes that  friends of my soul  is a Spanish phrase  Amigo de mi alma  Query

juryman says I challenge  him  I think there is a slight errour which destroys the connection and would read  Induc'd by potent circumstances that  You are mine enemy  I  make my  challenge  You shall

Theobald thinks it plain that this last speech must be given to  Flavius  But dr Johnson replaces  Marullus  who he says might  properly enough  reply to a saucy sentence directed to his colleague The cobler tells  Flavius  that if he be out he can  mend him  Can any thing therefor be more absurd than for  Marullus  to abuse the cobler for saying what he had not said that he could  mend  HIM And yet does the critic pronounce his reply to be made properly enough The hint however in the latter part of the note may incline one to give the first speech to  Marullus  instead of transferring the last to  Flavius  p  Mar  That Tyber trembled underneath  his  banks  "The old copies read  her  banks As  Tyber  is always represented by the figure of a man the feminine gender is improper STEEVENS"

the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves and went into the holy city and appeared unto many"  It is somewhat remarkable that neither St Luke nor St John should take the least notice of this prodigious event Even St Mark who onely copies or abridges St Matthew seems to have been fearful of trusting in this particular to his readers faith COLLINS  p  Caes  Danger knows full well  That Caesar is more dangerous than he  We  were  two lions litter'd in one day  And I the elder and more terrible  The old copies read  heare  which Theobald

me every way you wrong me Brutus  p  Bru  With this she fell distract  And her attendants absent  swallow'd fire  Mr Steevens after observing that this circumstance is taken from  Plutarch  and that it is also mentioned by  Valerius Maximus  says "It may not be amiss to remark that the death of Portia wants that foundation which has hitherto intitled her to a place in poetry as a pattern of Roman fortitude She is reported by Pliny  I think  to have died in Rome of a lingering illness while Brutus was abroad"  This indeed though a rather extraordinary is a tolerably easy method of overturning the credit of historians and the existence of an historical fact But surely with all the submission to the learned and ingenious commentator due authority of Plutarch and Valerius Maximus is somewhat better than a vague idea of its being contradicted by Pliny  p  Octa  Upon the right hand I keep  thou  the left  The tenour of the conversation evidently requires us to read  you  p  "Of this tragedy" dr Johnson says "many particular passages deserve regard but I have never been strongly agitated in perusing it and think it somewhat cold and unaffecting  c"  This is a strange charge If nature have denyed to this great critic the ordinary feelings of humanity is he therefor to accuse the poet Surely dr Johnson is the onely person living who would not be ashamed to declare hisself  insensible to the interesting and pathetic scenes of this admirable drama So far from Shakspeares adherence "to the real story and to Roman manners" having "impeded the natural vigour of his genius" he seems to have risen with the grandeur and importance of his subject and if there be any one play in these volumes which affects the heart more than the rest it may be safely averred to be this of Julius Caesar And he who is not "agitated in perusing it" may defy the powers of poetry to move him  The characters or dogmatical criticisms subjoined by the above learned philosopher at the end of each play are generally as in the present instance as unjust in theirselves as injurious to the immortal author and in many cases could onely proceed from one who either had not read the drama reviewed or from some natural defect was insensible of its beauty and merit  ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA  p  Char  Pr'ythee how many boys and wenches must I have  Soeth  If every of your wishes had a womb  And  foretel  every wish a million  That is says dr Johnson  if you had as many wombs as you will have w  shes and  I should  foretel all those wishes I should foret  l a million of children  The text as dr Warburton justly observes is nonsense and this explanation is as bad She asks the foothsayer how many children she is to have  why  says he  if all your wishes had wombs and  I  should  foretel every wish you would have a million  Ridiculous Is that any answer to her question He  does  foretel how many she will have Dr Warburton reads  fertil  which restores sense and spirit to the whole passage  p  Cleo  Can Fulvia die  Notwithstanding the ingenious comment upon this passage by mr Steevens one may be still inclined to think that Cleopatra means no more thanIs it possible that Fulvia should dye I will not believe it  p  Ale    So he nodded  And soberly did mount an  armgaunt steed  Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke  Was beastly dumb'd by him  Mr  Seyward  says dr Johnson in his preface to Beaumont has very elaborately endeavoured to prove that an  armgaunt  steed is a steed with  leanshoulders Arm  adds he is the Teutonic word for  want  or  poverty "Arm gaunt  may be therefore an old word signifying  lean  for  want  illfed Edwards's observation that a worn out horse is not proper for Atlas to mount in battle is impertinent the horse here mentioned seems to be a posthorse rather than a warhorse"  It is somewhat remarkable that when this great critic is desirous to introduce his own note on a passage whereon a much better has been already written he generally begins his observation by ridiculing that of his predecessor Mr Seward not  Seyward  as dr Johnson mr Steevens and mr Malone have every where  throughout this edition corrupted his name explains the word  armgaunt  by  thin shoulders  which he says is known to be one of the principal beauties of a horse And he adds that the epithet has from the uncommon use of either part of the compound word in this  ense an  antique dignity  and grandeur in sound that poets much delight in The reader will observe the difference between  thin shoulders  and  lean shoulders  the former being a beauty the latter a defect And this dr Johnson calls an  elaborate endeavour to prove  Not recollecting that his own attempt is more elaborate and much  ss ingenious and successful  Arm  may be the Teutoni  word for want and yet one would like to have some better proof of its existence than the bare dictum of one so little acquainted with ancient languages as dr Johnson is And even when that is given we should still be glad to know how Shakspeare came by it Dr Johnsons observation that this steed was a post horse is "impertinent" as a posthorse would scareely have made any distinction between Antony and his groom and yet the author represents it so proud of its burthen that its neigh silenced the bystanders  p  Pomp  I have fair  meaning  sir  Ant  And fair words to  them  The last word makes it evident that we should read  meanings  p  Eno  There's a strong fellow Menas    Pointing to the attendant who carries off  Lepidus  He bears  The third part of the world  Menas  The

to a  trull  Trull  dr Johnson says was not in our authors time a term of mere infamy but a word of slight contempt as  wench  is now It may be difficult to know what the learned commentator conceives to be a term of mere infamy But thus much is certain that  trull  in the age of Shakspeare signifyed a  strumpet  and so he uses it  p  Ant  Yes my lord yesHe at Philippi kept  His sword even like a dancer  Sworddances at Christmas are not peculiar to Northhumberland they are common to the adjoining counties and are not without the greatest probability supposed to have descended from the Romans    Pyrrby  Pyrrhic  dancers  is a name still given in the North to the streamers or Northern lights doubtless from the imaginary resemblance between their figure and motion and those of the Sworddancers or Ploughstors who always exhibit in their shirts  In these dances the swordpoints are generally over the shoulders of the performers Antony means that Caesar stood inactive with his sword on his shoulder  p  Ant  Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o'the moon  Shakspeare mr Steevens thinks might have taken part of this imagery from Heywood's  Silver age  If the  Silver  age  however were not printed before that year it is more likely that Shakspeare furnished Heywood  p  Cleo  not the imperious shew  Of the fullfortun'd Caefar ever shall  Be  brooch'd  with me  Brooch  says dr Percy is properly a bodkin or some such instrument originally a spit and ladies bodkins adds he being headed with gems it sometimes stands for an ornamental trinket or jewel in general in which sense he says it is perhaps used at present or as probably in its original one for  pinned up  c  A  brooch  is always an  ornament  whether a buckle or pin for the breast hat or hair or whatever other shape it may may assume A  broach  is a spit the spires of churches are likewise so called in the Northern couuties as  Darntonbroach Brooch'd  in the text certainly means  adorn'd  as it has been properly explained by mr Steevens  TIMON OF ATHENS  p  Pain  How this lord is follow'd  Poet  The senators of AthensHappy men  Mr Steevens would read  Happy  man thinking it the happiness of Timon and not that of the senators upon which the poet means to exclaim But the text is right The poet envies or admires the felicity of the senators in  being Timons friends and familiarly admitted to his table to partake of his good chear and experience the effects of his bounty  p  Poet  Apemantus even he  drops down  The knee before him  and returns in peace  Most rich in Timons nod  Either Shakspeare mr Steevens says meant to put a falsehood into the mouth of his poet or had not yet thoroughly planned the character of Apemantus for in the ensuing scenes his behaviour is cynical to Timon as to his followers  The behaviour of Apemantus is justly represented and yet the note might have been spared the authors consistency being liable to no charge The poet seeing that Apemantus paid frequent visits to Timon naturally concluded that he was equally courteous with his other guests The critic indeed knows the contrary but the speaker did not  p  Timon  I am not of that feather to shake off  My friend when he  must need  me  The sense would be certainly improved by reading thus  I am not of that feather to shake off  My friend when he  most needs  me  p  Tim  Purchance some single vantages you took  When my indisposition put you back  And that unaptness made  your  minister  Thus to excuse yourself  This is perfectly unintelligible "So however" says dr Johnson "the original" The later editions he tells us have all    made  you  minister  Which is right It is the reading of the second folio  p  Flav  My dear lov'd lord  Though you hear now  yet now's too late a time  The old editions read  Though you hear now  too late    yet now's a time  That is according to dr Warburton "Though it be now too late to retrieve your former fortunes yet it is not too late to prevent by the assistance of your friends your future miseries" Sir T Hanmer it seems made the alteration which though undoubtedly wrong dr Johnson thought right and admitted into his text The old reading however is not properly explained by dr Warburton  Though I tell you this  says Flavius  at too late a period perhaps for the information to be of service to you yet late as it is it is necessary that you should be acquainted with it  It is evident that the steward had very little hope of assistance from his masters friends  p  Var  Yes mine's three thousand crowns what's yours  Lu    Five thousand mine  Var  'Tis much deep and it should seem by the sum  Your masters confidence was above mine  Else surely his bad equall'd  Dr Johnson whose understanding frequently starts at the plainest passage and makes those who have little of  their own imagine difficulties where there are none asks if this should not be  else surely mine had equall'd  The answer is easy it should not Mr Malone has indeed undertaken to justify the text and given a long note upon it which HE may possibly understand Without taking further notice however of his seesaw conjectures the meaning of the passage is evidently and simply this  Your master it seems had more confidence in lord Timon than mine otherwise his  i e my masters  debt  i e the money due to him from Timon  would certainly have been as great as your masters  i e as the money which Timen owes to your masterthat is my master being as rich as yours could and would have advanced Timon as large a sum as your master has advanced him if he  i e  my master had thought it prudent to do so  p  Tim  maid to thy masters bed  Thy mistress is o'the brothel  The sense according to mr Steevens is Go maid with security to thy masters bed  for thy mistress is a bawd to thy amours  This is not altogether so clear One would father suppose it to mean that the mistress frequented the brothel and so sir T Hanmer understood it  p  Tim  those milkpaps  That through the window  bars  bore at mens eyes  The folios read  barne  and not improperly  En  is a common termination of a Saxon plural which we in numberless instances retain to this day The word is to be  explained by  bars  but should not though dr Warburton calls it strange nonsense have been removed from the text  p  Apemantus retreats  backward  Would not this ingenious remark be much improved by reading  Apemantus  advances  backward  Like the exercise of the city militia"Advance three paces backwards"  The editors have here and there indulged us with a few of these little marginal pleasantries which would not make a bad figure together The reader may take a specimen  Exit  Com and Men  vii  Exit  Worcester and Vernon  v  Enter Mortimer  brought in a chair v  Exit  Clown Autolycus Dorcas and Mopsa  iv  Exit  the queen and Hamlet dragging in Polonius  x  Exit  c  x  p  Scene II    Enter Poet and Painter  "The Poet and the Painter were within view when Apemantus parted from Timon and might then have seen Timon since Apemantus standing by him could see them But the scenes of the thieves and steward have passed before their arrival and yet passed as the drama is now conducted within their view It might be suspected that some scenes are transposed for all these difficulties would be removed by introducing the Poet and Painter first and the thieves in this place Yet I am afraid the scenes must keep their present order for the Painter alludes to  the thieves when he says  he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity  This impropriety is now heightened by placing the thieves in one act and the Poet and Painter in another but it must be remembered that in the original edition this play is not divided into separate acts so that the present distribution is arbitrary and may be changed if any convenience can be gained or impropriety obviated by alteration JOHNSON"  Had the learned critic perused the small remainder of the Painters speech he would have perceived another incongruity of which he does not seem to be aware In the immediately preceding scene the first of the fifth act Flavius Timons steward has a conference with his master and receives gold from him Between this and the present scene a single minute cannot be supposed to pass and yet the Painter tells his companion  'tis said he gave  his steward a  mighty sum  Where was it said Why in Athens whence it must therefor seem they are but newly come  Here  then should be fixed the commencement of the  fifth act  in order to allow time for Flavius to return to the city and for rumour to publish his adventure with Timon But how are we in this case to account for Apemantuses announcing the approach of the Poet and Painter in the last scene of the preceding act and before the thieves appear It is possible that when this play was abridged for representation all between this passage and the entrance of the Poet and Painter may have been omitted by the players and these words put into the mouth of Apemantus to introduce them and that when it was published at large the interpolation was unnoticed Or if we allow the Poet and the Painter to see Apemantus it may be conjectured that they did not think his presence necessary at their interview with Timon and had therefor returned back into the city  p  Sol  By all description this should be the place  Who's here speak hoNo answerWhat is this  Timon is dead who hath outfiretch'd his span  Some beast read this  there does not live a man  Dead sure and this his grave What's on this tomb  I cannot read the character I'll take with wax  Dr Warburton proposes  rear'd  for  read  and says that the soldier had onely seen the rude heap of earth But dr Johnson who seems to have thought that the chief part of his busyness consisted in a  totis viribus  opposition to the most judicious improvements of preceding commentators and that there is as much honour to be got by the demolition as by the erection of an elegant structure observes that the soldier "had evidently seen something that told him  Timon was dead  and what could tell that but his tomb The tomb he sees and the inscription upon it which not being able to read and finding none to read it for him he exclaims peevishly  some beast read this  for it must be read and in this place it cannot be read by man"  Now with all proper deserence to the misunderstanding and confusion under which the learned critic labours in the above note it is evident that the soldier when he first sees the heap of earth does not know it to be a  tomb  He concludes that Timon must be dead because he receives  no answer  It is likewise evident that when he utters the words  some beast c  he has  not  seen the inscription And dr Warburtons emendation is therefor not onely just and happy but absolutely necessary  What can this heap of earth be  says the soldier  Timon is certainly dead some beast must have  erected  this for here does not  ive a man to do itYes he is dead sure enough and  this must be his grave What is this writing upon it  Dr Johnson is not content with representing the soldier as peevish he makes him a perfect fool For thus according to the sagacious commentators exposition will his soliloquy stand  I cannot read these letters I must get  some beast  to  read them for me  for read they must be and read in this place they cannot be by man  But first where was the so urgent necessity of the inscription being read at all and secondly why could  no man  read it where it was  TITUS ANDRONICUS  p  Mar  The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax  That slew himself  c  This passage convinces mr Steevens that this play was the work of one conversant with the Greek tragedies in their original language and therefor not of Shakspeare "We have here" says he "a plain allusion to the  Ajax  of Sophocles of which no translation was extant in the time of Shakspeare" If the fact were true of which however neither mr Steevens nor any man now living can be certain  Theobald has supposed a passage in this play to have been gleaned from the Hecuba of Euripides But says mr Steevens upon that occasion "mr Theobald should first have proved to us that our author understood Greek or else that this play of Euripides had been translated In the mean time because neither of these particulars are verified we may as well suppose he took it from the old story book of the Trojan war or the old translation of Ovid" Why should mr Steevens require a proof from Theobald of a circumstance which he hisself here assumes as a matter of fact  numbers of printed tracts and even large volumes having perished since that period as accidents and  the researches of antiquarians dayly prove still Shakspeare might have been indebted for the circumstance to some manuscript version or the information of a more learned friend Or as is very probable the same allusion may be contained in other old books There are many expressions in the course of the play which do not prove the author to have been very familiar with the ancients Among other instances which might be adduced Marcus praises Lavinia for her excellent performance on the  lute  And it will not be very easy to decide whether the characters or at least the times are Christian or Heathen  p  Chi  Not I till I have sheath'd  c  The editors have here adopted a transposition made by dr Warburton for which there is not the least reason Onely the matter is not of sufficient consequence to dwell upon  p  D  m  She is a woman therefore may be woo'd  She is a woman therefore may be won  Suffolk in the  First part of king Henry VI  makes use of almost the same words  She's beautiful and therefore to be woo'd  She is a woman therefore to be won  How much or how little soever this may serve to prove if facts and evidence be to determine our judgement there cannot remain a doubt that this play of  Titus Andronicus  is as much Shakspeares as any other in this collection It is not onely given to him by Mer  s but is printed as his by the  editors of the first folio his fellow comedians and intimate friends who neither could have been deceived theirselves nor could or would have deceived the public  VOLUME THE NINTH  TROILUS AND CRESSIDA  p  Cre  Women are angels wooing  Things won are done  joy's soul lies in the doing  So says dr Johnson read both the old editions for which adds he the later editors have  orly given  the soul's joy  lies in doing  Whatever may be the poverty of the expression it did not originate with the later editors It is the reading of the second folio  p  Patr  No more words Thersites peace  Ther  I will hold my peace when  Achilles' brach  bids me shall I  The folio and quarto editions it seems read  brooch  which leads dr Johnson to think the meaning equivalent to one of Achilles'  hangers  on Mr Malone who it must be confessed generally comes foreward to a very good or useful purpose observes that  Brooch  had some meaning at present unknown For says he in the following passage  in Lodges  Rosalynde  it seems to signify something very different from a  pin  or a  bodkin  "His bonnet was green whereon stood a copper  brooch  with the picture of St Dennis" A  brooch  is an  ornament  likewise a  buckle  of uncommon workmanship for the hat or breast Such a one as had an image or figure of St Dennis upon it would probably conceal the pin or prong which kept it fast to the hat or girdle K Lewis the eleventh of France generally wore a leaden figure of  St Andrew  in his hat which perhaps answered the purpose of a  brooch  or buckle  Thus in  Loves Labour Lost  ii  Biron  St George's half cheek in a brooch  Dum  Ay and in a brooch of lead  Biron  Ay and worn in the cap of a toothdrawer  Brach  is certainly the true reading  p  Trei  the remainder viands  We do not throw in unrespective  sieve  Sieve  it seems is in the quarto The folio according to dr Johnson reads  unrespective  same  same  for which he says the modern editors have silently printed  unrespective  place  The learned commentator is so perfectly acquainted with the old copies that it is wonderful to find an ancient reading escape him  Place  however cannot well be the silent interpolation of a modern editor as it is to be found in the second folio  p  Patr  Why am I a fool  Ther  Make that demand  of the prover  So says dr Johnson the quarto The folio adds mr Steevens profanely reads  of thy    to the  Creator This would be intelligible however which the adopted reading is not And as to any  profaneness  there may be in the words rejected which every person may not so readyly discover the author is answerable for it not the editor  p  Pan  What exploit's in hand where sups he to night  Helen  Nay but my lord  Pan

disposer  is fick  Disposer  dr Warburton thinks should in both places be  dispouser  she that would separate Helen from Paris Dr Johnson does not understand the word nor know what to substitute in its place He says there is no variation in the copies Mr Steevens suspects that  you must not know when he sups  should be added to the speech of Pandarus and that the following one of Paris should be given to Helen He thinks that  disposer  should be changed into  deposer  and supposes that she addresses herself to Pandarus and by  deposer  meansshe who thinks her beauty or whose beauty you suppose to be superior to mine  Mr Steevenses conjecture is very ingenious and happy but the propriety of his explanation is very doubtful The dialogue should perhaps be regulated thus  Par  where sups he to night  Helen  Nay but my lord  Pan  What says my sweet queen  Par  My cousin will fall out with you  To Helen  Pan  You must not know where he sups  To Paris  Helen  I'll lay my life with my  deposer  Cressida  She calls Cressida her  deposer  not for either of the reasons assigned by mr Steevens but because she had  deposed  her in the affections of Troilus whom Fandarus in a preceding scene is ready to swear  she lov'd more than Paris  Dr Johnson mistakes in asserting the uniformity of the the copies The second folio reads the fifth speech thus  Pan  With my disposer Cressida  p  Pan  Oh oh groans out for ha ha ha  Hey ho  Hey ho  This exclamation is thus added in the folio to the preceding line  O ho grones out for ha ha hahey ho  But the interjection is certainly no part of the song and consequently should not appear in the same character it is uttered by Pandarus after he has done singing This is evident from Helens observation  In love i'faith to

which he does The construction is plain enough and if the rime be thought worth preserving by a violence to the text we may read  Why beg  toe  The remainder upon which the same learned commentator has given an unintelligible note might be regulated thus  Ulyss  Why then for Venus' sake give me a kiss  Cres  When Helen is a maid again and his  I am your debtor claim it when 'tis due  Ulyss

repeated JOHNSON"  Let us turn to  the end of the play  and see what the critic says there  "  Hence  broker  lacquey  So the quarto The  folio  has  brother  JOHNSON"  The concordance of the two comments is surprising  After all however  brothel lacquey  seems the best reading though  broker  is certainly in this place the reading of the folio  p  Nest  like scaled  sculls  Before the

Steevens tells us was one who stood by to part the combatants  c  They are called  sticklers  he says from carrying  sticks  or  staves  in their hands It is not here meant to question the propriety of mr Steevenses explanation of the word but the nature of the English language cannot possibly allow the derivation of  slickler  from  stick  with which as a word it has not the remotest connection  Besides the giving  sticks  or  staves  to the  seconds  or sidesmen seems a mere  gratisdictum  for which the ingenious critic can have no authority but such as he may be able to produce from the practice of  Parisgarden Stickler  is simply from the verb  stickle  to interfere to take part with to busy ones self on either side  CYMBELINE  p    Gent  You speak him  far    Gent  I do  extend him

certainly wrong in saying that  Mirrour of Knighthood  does not give the idea of a  glass  but of an  example Miroir de Chevalerie Sp  cc  io di cavalleria Espejo de cavallerias  are all  a lookingglass for chi  alry  And so is the word properly rendered in our English versions of the history of Don Quixote who is called "a lookingglass in which all the valiant knights of the world may behold themselves" But one might be glad to know who ever stiled  Don Bellianis  the  Morrour of Knighthood  before dr Johnson  p  Jack  could this  carle  A very drudge of nature's have subdu'd me  "

others to bid their readers  see  this or that scarce book of which it is as they well know frequently impossible for them to procure a sight But never was this absurdity carryed to such an extent of mockery as it is in the present instance where the learned prelate very coolly orders us to  inspect  a poem onely extant as he is well assured and has elsewhere told us in a certain FOLIO MS in  his

explanation which requires very little knowlege of ones author It should not se  m that cattle stung by the gadfly are actuated by caprice but whether or not is a circumstance foreign to the purpose A

have been aware  p  Edg  Poor Turlygood poor Tom  That's something yet  Edgar I nothing am  This dr Johnson explains "As Edgar I am outlawed dead in law I have no longer any political existence" And surely nothing can be more completely ridiculous Outlawry is the effect of many legal proceedings in the ordinary course of justice and neither the speaker nor the author can have the least allusion

because by her sisters now rendered less difficult to compass she could possess the whole kingdom  p  Reg  Lord Edmund spake not with  your lady  at home  Stew  No madam  The folio reads  your lord  but says dr Johnson lady is the first and better reading If the learned critic had not been too indolent to look back a few pages to the second scene of this act he would have found that though  lady  may be the  first  and  better  reading  lord  is the  true  and  right  one For  Goneril  not onely  converses  with  lord Edmund  in the  stewards presence  but prevents him from  speaking to  or even  seeing  her  husband  p  Gent  Ay madam in the heaviness of his sleep  We put fresh garments on him  Phys  Be by good madam when we do awake him  I doubt not of his temperance  The folio mr Steevens observes gives these four lines to a  gentleman  The quartos it seems distribute them very differently But the ingenious critic will recollect that in the folio the  gentleman  and as he is here called the  physician  is one and the same person a circumstance he does not appear to have at all attended to  p  The  goujeres  shall devour them  c  "The resolute John Florio" dr Farmer says "has sadly mistaken these  goujeers  He writes with a  good yeare  to thee" and gives it in Italian "Il  mal' anno  che dio ti dia"  But does the ingenious commentator really suppose that John meant a  blessing  instead of a  curse  In fact the pedant is guilty of no mistakethat he intended these very  goujeers  is evident from the folio of Shakspeare where it is said  The  good yeares  shall devour them  And this was the usual spelling of that age  p  Gon  Mean you to enjoy him  Alb  The let alone lies not in your good will  "Whether he who shall not or shall what depends not on your choice JOHNSON"  This ingenious and occult annotation is grounded on and supported by CANON XV which allows the professed critic to "explane a difficult passage by words absolutely unintelligible"  There is not it may be here observed one of the Canons which could not be properly illustrated and supported by numerous examples from the margin of the last edition  Albany means to tell his wife that however she might want the power she evidently did not want the inclination to prevent the match  p  Edg  Let us exchange charity  "Our author" says dr Johnson "by negligence gives his heathens the sentiments and practices of christianity"  Does the learned critic mean to insinuate that benevolence or a forgiveness of injuries could not subsist without a belief in christianity That  heathens  could not act like  men  The contrary it is believed is so much a fact that it would be no paradox to assirm because it might be very easyly proved that all the moral virtues were better understood and more regarded by Heathen Greece and Pagan Rome thathey have been by any Christian state since the invention or introduction of that system And what would the great philosopher think if it were to be made appear that the first Christians borrowed or rather stole for they took without acknowlegement all their morality from the professors of Paganism Indeed it must be absurd to suppose for a single moment that they who had more  sense  than their successors had not at least as much  virtue  p  Kent  I have a journey sir shortly to go  My master calls and I must not say no  The modern editors mr Steevens says have supposed that Kent expires after he has repeated these two lines  but the speech he thinks rather appears to be meant for a despairing than a dying man and adds that as the old editions give no marginal direction for his death he has forborn to insert any  The construction mr Steevens puts upon Kents speech is not meant to be disputed But it might have been as well if before he had charged his death upon the  modern editors  and asserted that the  old editions  give no direction about it he had consulted  those editions  For nothing can be more certain than that the second folio at the end of this speech has the word  Dyes  in the margin  The folios give the couplet thus  I have a journey sir shortly to go  My master calls me I shust not say no  VOLUME THE TENTH  ROMEO AND JULIET  p  Ben  What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours  Rom  Nor having that which having makes them short  Ben  In love  Rom  Out  Ben  Of love  Rom  Out of her favour where I am in love  "I" says dr Percy "take  out  not to be an imperfect part of a sentence cut off by aposiopesis but rather the interjection  still used in the north where they say  Out  much in the same sense as we now say  fye  "  Mr Steevens very pertinently asks the doctor why Romeo should say  fye  on being asked if he were in love But mr Steevens gives no opinion  It is evident that this word  out  which is neither an interjection nor cut off by aposiopesis would in case Romeo had not been interrupted have been as it is the first of his following speech  Out  of her favour  c  p  Rom  These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows  i e  says mr Steevens the masks worn by female spectators of the play But this is by no means so certain And there is little reason for thus forcing improprieties upon the author of which he may not be guilty  These  or  those  merely resers to the masks worn by ladies Shakspeare knew it to be a custom in London and supposed it to be one in Verona  p  Cap  Such comfort as do lusty  young men  feel  When wellapparel'd April on the heel  Of limping winter treads  Dr Johnson reads  yeomen  which though mr Steevens does not agree with him seems at least to be the interpretation of  young men  as these words are perpetually used for  yeomen  in old writings See particularly the legends of Robin Hood and Adam Bell So in a subsequent scene of this very play  yew trees  are in the old editions called  yong trees  p  Rom  I'll be a candleholder and look on  The game was ne'er so fair and I am done  An allusion to an old proverbial saying which advises to "give over when the game is at the fairest"  p  Merc  This is that very Mab  That  cakes  the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs  If all the old copies read  bakes  which mr Steevens says they do what authority had mr Pope to make the alteration and why is it followed  p  Cap  Nay sit nay sit good  cousin Capulet  This cousin Capulet dr Johnson observes is  unkle  in the paper of invitation but as Capulet is described as old  consin  is probably he says the right word in both places  Each reading is right in its place  Cousin  was a common expression from one kinsman to another out of the degrees of parent and child brother and sister Thus in  Hamlet  the king his uncle and stepfather addresses him with  But now my  cousin  Hamlet and my  son  And in this very play act III lady Capulet says  Tybalt my  cousin  O my  brothers child  So in  As you like it  Res  Me  uncle  Duke  You  cousin  And Olivia in the  Twelfth Night  constantly calls her  uncle  Toby  cousin  p  Enter Chorus  The use of this chorus dr Johnson thinks is not easyly discovered as it relates nothing but what is already known or what the next scene will shew Indeed it seems to have been brought out merely to fill up part of the vacancy of time between the acts instead of a piece of music The groundlings of that age like the rooflings of the present would doubless be ever impatient to know what was to come next  p  Ben  Come he hath hid himself among those trees  To be consorted with the  humorous  night  Mr Steevens brings some instances from other authors to prove that Shakspeare means  humid  and mr Malone who is remarkable for the pertinence propriety and real importance of his learned and ingenious remarks adds the following note  "Again in  Measure for Measure  "The  vaporous  night approaches"  To prove no doubt that Shakspeare as he has here used  humorous  for  humid  there uses  vaporous  for  vapid  p  Mer  And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit  As maids call medlars when they laugh alone  As maids  c "After this line" says mr Steevens "in the quarto I find two other verses containing such ribaldry that I cannot venture to insert them in the text though I exhibit them here as a proof that either the poor or his friends knew sometimes how to blot" Surely the  poet and his friends are under very little obligation to the ingenious commentator for producing an indecent passage which he supposes one or other of them to have already suppressed But after all the learned editor is mistaken for despicable as the lines are they were NOT blotted either by the poet or by his friendsand if he will take the trouble of turning to either of the folios he will THERE find them  p  Rom  He jests at scars that never felt a wound  That is says dr Johnson Mercutio jests who has just left the scene and whom he overheard But with all due submission it does not appear that Romeo either did or could nor is there any occasion that he should hear Mercutio  He  that person  jests  c is merely in allusion to his having conceived hisself so armed with the love of Rosaline that no other beauty could make any impression on him This is clear from the conversation he has with Mercutio just before they go to Capulets  p  Jul  'Tis but thy name that is my enemy  Thou art thyself though  not  a Montague  What's Montague  c  There is certainly some obscurity in this passage which might possibly be remov'd by reading  Thou art thyself though  yet  a Montague  Or thus  Thou art thyself although a Montague  At least Juliets meaning seems to be that though he was a Montague by name and therefor her enemy yet for his person and mind  i e  as a man she might still be  allowed to love him Either of the above proposed readings which yet are only for the margin seem as good as this which dr Johnson thinks the true one  Thou art thyself  then  not a Montague  And certainly much better than this of Hanmer  Thou 'rt not  thyself  so  though  a Montague  The subsequent lines which in the present edition stand thus  What's Montague it is nor hand nor foot  Nor arm nor face nor any other part  What's in a name  c  and in the folio thus  What's Montague it is nor hand nor foot  Nor arm nor face O be some other name  Belonging to a man  What's in a name  c  should perhaps be thus regulated  What's Montague it is nor hand nor foot  Nor arm nor face nor any other part  Belonging to a man O be some other name  What's in a name  c  The words  nor any other part  which are in the quarto editions seem to have been omitted in the folio by inadvertency  p  Rom  My life were better ended by their hate  Than death  prorogued  wanting of thy love  To  prorogue  mr Steevens observes has not in this place its common signification but means to  delay  And what is its common signification but to  delay  When  the king  prorogues  the parliament he only defers or puts off its meeting to a future day  p  Fri  Holy  St Francis  c  "Old copy  Jesu Maria  STEEVENS"  And why not this  p  Mer  A pox of such antick lisping affecting  fantasticoes  Thus the  old copies  says mr Steevens and rightly The  modern editors  adds he read  phantasies  The folio however which is generally looked upon as an  old copy  does NOT read  fantasticoes  and Heminge and Condell who are not  usually  ranked among  modern editors  read  phantacies  p  Nurse  Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin with a letter  Rom  Ay nurse what of that both with an R  Nurse  Ah mocker that's the dog's name  R is for the dog No  I know it begins with some other letter  The old reading appears to be  R is for  the no  I know it begins with some other letter  The alteration adopted was proposed by mr Tyrwhitt and is certainly superior to either dr Warburtons Thee  no  or dr Johnsons  the  nonce not but the old reading is as good if not better when properly regulated  e g  Ah mocker that's the dog's name R is for theno  I know it begins with some other letter  In any case the long notes preceding mr Tyrwhitts might be well spared being now wholely impertinent to the text  p  Friar  Therefore love moderately long love doth so  Too  swift arrives as tardy as too slow  Alluding to the vulgar proverb  The more haste the worse speed  p  Jul  But my true love is grown to such excess  I cannot sum up  half my sum  of wealth  The old copies according to mr Steevens read  I cannot sum up  sum of half  my wealth  And  I cannot sum up  some  of half my wealth  The following would therefor be nearer the original reading than the present text  I cannot sum up  th'  sum of half my wealth  p  Juliet  Back foolish tears back to your native spring  Your tributary drops belong to  woe  Which you mistaking offer up to  joy  Mr Steevens thinks the words  woe  and  joy  should change places otherwise says he her reasoning is inconclusive The learned critic does not seem to have paid his usual attention to the passage The text is certainly right Juliet says that she has more reason to  rejoice  than to be  sorry  at Tibalts death and that therefor her tears are egregiously mistimed  p  Jul  That  banished  that one word  banished  Hath stain ten thousand Tybalts  "Hath put Tybalt out of my mind as if out of being JOHNSON"  Out of being why where was he before The true meaning is  I am more affected by Romeos banishment than I should be by the death of ten thousand such relations as Tybalt  p  Jul  It was the  nightingale  and not the lark  That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear  Nightly she sits on you pomegranate tree  "This is not" mr Steevens says "merely a poetical supposition It is observed of the nightingale that if undisturbed  she  sits and sings upon the same tree for many weeks together"  It may be very true but the learned critic will recollect that it can only be so of the  he  and not of the  she  nightingale as the latter  never sings  The discovery is not indeed of the age of Shakspearebut what of that  p  Jul  Hunting thee hence with  hunts up  to the day  The hunts up mr Steevens says was the name of the tune anciently played to wake the hunters and collect them together And in proof of it he quotes a number of passages to which if the please he may add the following from Charles Cottons  Virgil Travestie  which indeed it is somewhat extraordinary he should omit  I'll  play  the rakehells such a  hunts up  There was likewise a little rude song which it is supposed was formerly in use on this occasion as we learn  from Puttenham  Art of English Poesie  "One  Gray  " says he "what good estimation did he grow into with king Henry the eighth and afterward with the duke of Somerset protectour for making certain merry ballades whereof one chiefly was  The hunte is up the hunte is up  " Whether the following be the identical  merry ballade  doth not clearly appear it is however very old  The hunt is up the hunt is up  And now it is almost day  And he that's a bed with another mans wife  It's time to get him away  Master Gray was probably author of both words and music and the tune may have remained in use after the words were forgot  p  Jul  gentle nurse  I pray thee leave me to myself tonight  For I have need of many orisons  To move the heavens to smile upon my state  Dr Johnson with that candour and politeness for which he is so remarkable observes that Juliet plays most of her  pranks  under the appearance of religion Perhaps says he Shakspeare meant to  punish  her  hypocrisy  If he had we should without doubt have been some how or other informed of it But Shakspeare would never have given the little innocent excuses her virtue and conjugal fidelity prompt her to make use of so harsh a nameSweet Juliet little did'st thou dream that in addition to thy misfortunes the unsullyed purity of thy angelic mind should at this distance of time be subject to the rude breath of criticismBut rest in peace sweet saint thy  fair untained name shall livelive in thy Shakspeares pagewhen even the critics memory is no more  p  Cap  O son the night before thy wedding day  Hath death lain with thy bride  Mr Steevens is willing to suppose that this passage may have been coarsely ridiculed in Deckers  Satiromastix  "Dead she's Death's bride he hath her maidenhead"  The ingenious commentator who pursues such objects with perhaps too much avidity might have caught a much more likely hint in another place from Juliets own mouth The judicious reader however will find many opportunities to remark that numerous expressions which are now degraded by vulgar currency were perfectly innocent and polite in the age of Shakspeare  Ibi  Cap  Death is my soninlaw death is my heir  My daughter he hath wedded I will die  And leave him all life leaving all is death's  "  Death is my soninlaw  c The remaining part of the speech I have restored from the quarto STEEVENS"  It is unfortunate that the industrious editor did not know that the lines  restored  are in both the folios  p  Muss  What will you give us  Pet  No money on my faith but the  gleek  The use of this cant term is no where explained and in all probability cannot at this distance of time be recovered  To  gleek  however signifyed to put a joke or trick upon a person perhaps to  jest  according to the coarse humour of that age So Bottom  Midsummor Nights Dream  act III scene i  Nay I can  gleek  upon occasion  Queen  Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful  Dumps  were heavy mournful tunes possibly indeed  any sort  of movements were once so called as we sometimes meet witha  merry dump  Hence  doleful dumps  deep sorrow or grievous affliction as in the next page and in the less ancient ballad of  Chevy Chase  It is still said of a person uncommonly sad that he is  in the dumps  p  Pet  It is  musick with her silver sound  because  such fellows as you  have no gold for founding  Instead of  fellows  which is the reading of the old quarto in later editions mr Steevens observes have  musicians  "I should suspect" adds he "that a  fidler  made the alteration"But does the ingenious commentator really imagine that  such fellows  were the editors of subsequent impressions or had even power to alter the language of Shakspeare whenever they were displeased at it The change was less doubtfully made by the author out of compliment to or upon a remonstrance from the  Gentlemen of the orchestra  p  Rom  famine is in thy cheeks  Need and oppression  starveth  in thine eyes  The first quarto mr Steevens informs us reads  "And starved samine dwelleth in thy cheeks"  The quartos and the folio as in the text  The modern editors without authority  "Need and oppression  stare  within their eyes  The passage might perhaps be better regulated thus  Need and oppression  stareth  in thy eyes  For they cannot properly be said to  starve  in his eyes though  starved famine  may be allowed to dwell in his cheeks  Thy  not  thine  is the reading of the folio And those who are conversant in our author and especially in the old copies will scarcely notice the grammatical impropriety of the proposed emendation  p  Lau  Unhappy fortune by my brotherhood  The letter was not  nice  but full of charge  Of dear import  That is it was not a mere letter of compliment or ceremony  p  Rom  Thou  detestable  maw thou womb of death  Détestable  is right So Spenser  Faerie Queen  I i  That  detestable  sight him much amaz'd  Which mr Church has not been ashamed to declare read better "in  his ear" detèstable  Such an ear totally disqualifyed him for an editor of Spenser  The modern pronunciation has arisen from vulgarity and ignorance the word being not formed of the verb  detest  but derived from  detestable  F  detestabilis  L Thus  admirable comparable  c  The words  persevere persever  and  perseverance  are in the same predicament always right in Shakspeare and always wrong at present  p  Rom  I beseech thee youth  Pull not  another sin upon my head  By urging me to fury  The quarto it seems has  heap  not The quartos and and all the folios  Put  not Mr Rowe first made the change which mr Steevens and we are much indebted both to his sagacity and friendship informs us "may be  discontinued  at the  readers pleasure  " The editors duty however and not the readers pleasure ought to have determined the matter The reader has it not in his power to discontinue any thing but the perusal of the book Either of the other words would answer as well  p  Rom  How oft when men are at the point of death  Have they been merry which their keepers call  A lightning before death O  how  may I  Call this a lightning  Dr Johnson thinks we should read  O  now  may I  Call this a lighting  But  how  is certainly right and proper Romeo had just before been in high spirits a symptom which he observes was sometimes called a  lightning  before death but how says he for no situation can exempt Shakspeares characters from the vice of punning can I term this  sal  and  gloomy  prospect a  lightning  p  Rom  O here  Will I set up my everlasting  rest  This again is a quibble between the implement formerly used by foot soldiers and the certain quiet of a future state  The writer of these notes will here take occasion to observe as one of the many great excellencies of this immortal bard that no author ancient or modern ever sacrificed less to the reigning superstition of the time than hisself Whatever may be the temporary religion Popish or Protestant Paganism or Christianity if its professors have the slightest regard for genius or virtue Shakspeare the poet of nature addicted to no system of bigotry will always be a favourite There never was but one set of men who professed open enmity to his name and writings and they were at the same time the declared and most virulent enemies of literature and morality in every shape It is scarcely necessary to add the mention of the barbarous enthusiasts of the last century one and perhaps the best founded of whose charges against that great and good monarch whom they so savagely murdered washis intimacy with the writings of WILLIAM SHAKSPEAREThe circumstance would at this time at least pass unnoticed in such a miscreant as  Cocke  to whom a hatred of letters was as natural as it was to his more illustrious predecessor  Jack Cade  but when we see Miltonthe sublime Miltoninsisting upon the enormity of this amiable trait in the character of his murdered and libeled sovereignour contempt for and detestation of the act is equaled by our surprize to find  him  the assassin  p  Lau  I will be brief  c  Dr Johnson thinks it "much to be lamented that the poet did not conclude the dialogue with the action and avoid a narrative of events which the audience already knew" It was necessary however that the surviving characters should be made acquainted with the circumstances which produce the catastrophe and we should have had more reason to condemn the poet for being  brief  than  tedious  That our judicious author knew when to tell his story behind the curtain and when upon the stage is evident from the next play and it was perhaps to avoid a sameness between the conclusion of that and present that he has made the friar reveal the transaction to the audience which naturally introduces the reconciliation of the two families and the moral reflections at the end of the scene which whatever the critic may think are too valuable to be sacrificed to his mere rule and compass abridgement of it  p  Prince  And I for winking at your discords too  Have lost  a brace of kinsmen  What kinsmen  Mercutio  doubtless is one and  Benvolio  we may presume is the other The line therefor which communicated the tidings of the latters death to the audience p  And young  Benvolio  is  deceased  too  and which mr Steevens rejects as he supposes Shakspeare to have done "as unnecessary slaughter" should be restored to the text His death should seem to have been occasioned by grief for the death of one friend and the banishment  of the other and we no where find that the prince was any way related to either the Capulets or the Montagues  HAMLET  Dr Johnsons assertion that "this play is printed in the folio of more correctly than almost any other of the works of Shakespeare" could onely proceed from his never having looked into it If any one play is in that edition more incorrect than all the rest it is Hamlet Even the accuracy of mr Steevens has suffered some hundreds of its various readings to escape him    p  Ber  If you do meet  Horatio and Marcellus  The rivals of my watch  bid them make hast  By  rivals  the speaker certainly means  partners  according to dr Warburtons explanation or those whom he expected to watch with him Marcellus had watched with him before whether as a centinel a volunteer or from mere curiosity we do not learn but whichever it was it seems evident that his station was on the same spot with Bernardo and that there is no other centinel by them relieved Possibly Marcellus was an officer whose duty it was to visit each watch and perhaps continue with it some time Horatio as it appears watches out of curiosity But in act II scene i to Hamlets question  Hold you the watch tonight  Horatio Marcellus and Bernardo all answer  we do my honour'd lord  The folio indeed reads  both  which one may with greater propriety refer to Marcellus and Bernardo If we did not find the latter gentleman in such good company we might have taken him to have been like  Francisco whom he relieves an honest but common soldier The strange indiscriminate use of Italian and Roman names in this and other plays makes it obvious that the author was very little conversant in even the rudiments of either language  p  King  But now my cousin Hamlet and my son  Ham  A  little more than  KIN  and less than  KIND  i e  we are indeed somewhat too nearly  related  but our relationship savours very little either of  nature  or  affection  Why the page of Shakspeare should be loaded and disgraced with such a quantity of illfounded and injudicious notes is a question that every reader will find frequent occasion to ask To any one acquainted with the language of Shakspeare and of nature the sense of this passage was sufficiently clear Bishop Warburton and dr Johnson out of the abundance of their misunderstanding have done every thing in their power to confound it and those who look upon them to be the most intelligent and sagacious of all possible critics are naturally led to conceive difficulties which do not exist Mr Steevens has established the true reading and if there be any necessity for a note his with a little alteration should alone remain and all the others be consigned to the oblivion they so well merit  p  King  Let the world take note  You are the most immediate to our throne  And with no less nobility of love  Than that which dearest father bears his son  Do I  impart  toward you  "The crown of Denmark was  elective  STEEVENS"  Whereever the learned commentator acquired this piece of knowlege certain it is that his quotation from  Sir Clyomon  proves no such thing  And me possess for spoused wife who  in election  am  To have the crown of Denmark here  as heir unto the same  For it clearly appears from this that she was to take the crown by  hereditary right  The words  in election  implying no more than that she had  such right  by the  election  the  chosenness  the  elevation  of her rank and family The king tells Hamlet that he is  the most immediate to the throne  i e  heir apparent  or at least  presumptive heir  which would be absurd on an idea that the crown was elective See also the conversation of Laertes with his sister in scene iii  Impart  most assuredly means  profess myself bear me towards you  and not what

selfslaughter  A quibble between  ordnance  and  ecclesiastical decrees  Mr Steevens is an advocate for the former sense mr Theobald for the latter What happyness what immortal glory to be the conciliator of such contending chieftains in criticism  p  Pol  For the apparel oft proclaims the man  And they in France of the best rank and station  Are most select and generous chief in that  This pointing which comes recommended by mr Steevens makes the most ingenious and absolute nonsense of the whole passage The folios read  Are of a most select and generous cheff in that without any punctuation The genuine meaning of the passage requires us to point the line thus  Are most select and generous chief in that  i e  the nobility of France are select and generous above all other nations and chiefly in the point of apparel the richness and elegance of their dress  p  Ham  That these men  Carrying I say the stamp of one defect  Being nature's livery or  fortune's star    One of the quarto editions and the editors have not condescended to inform us that the passage is in consequence no doubt of the authors own alteration omitted in the folios reads  scar  which dr Johnson thinks more proper But dr Johnson did not perhaps know neither does it appear that mr Steevens could acquaint him that the word  star  in the text signifies a  scar  of  that appearance  It is a term of  farriery  the  white star  or mark so common on the forehead of a dark coloured horse is according to another humane practice peculiar it is believed to this generous country usually produced by making a  scar  on the place  Ibi  The dram of base  Doth all the noble substance  of worth out  To his own scandal  This must be allowed a very difficult and perplexed passage But as mr Steevenses proposed reading  doth all the noble substance  oft do out or rather indeed mr Holts  Doth all the noble substance  oft adopt comes nearest to the traces of the original  The dram of  ease  Doth all the noble substance  of a doubt    it ought to have been inserted in preference to Theobalds And the whole speech from the fourth line should have been thrown to the bottom of the page or perhaps totally omitted as apparently rejected by the author upon a revision of his play  p  Hor  To what issue will this come  Mar  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark  Hor  Heaven will  direct it  "Perhaps" says dr Farmer "it may be more apposite to read heaven will  detect it  "  Horatio asks to what issue this strange busyness will come and not receiving any answer from Marcellus at least one to his purpose very naturally adds Heaven will  direct  or  lead it  Dr Farmer and Horatio seem to be thinking of two distinct subjects the latter is reflecting upon the  appearance of the ghost  the former upon the  rottenness of the state  p  Ghost  I find thee apt  And duller should'st thou be than the  fat weed  That  rots itself  in ease on Lethe's wharf  Would'st thou not stir in this  Rots itself  is the reading of the two first folios that of the  quarto  mr Steevens informs us but as there are more quartos than one we should have been more obliged to him if he had told us to  which  he alludes and what the  others  read is  roots  and mr Pope followed it though mr Steevens thinks the superiority of the present reading apparent  "To be in a quiescent state" he says "  i e  to  root itself  affords an idea of activity" Very little activity one would imagine is necessary for the purpose of a weed  rooting itsself  and that little is made almost none when it  roots itsself in ease  To  rot  he thinks better suits with the dullness and inaction to which the ghost refers" "And yet" adds he "the accusative case  itself  may seem to demand the verb  roots  " And with that reading the text would certainly be better For setting aside the impropriety of giving an  octive  signification to a  neuter  verb it is far from being either necessary or even proper that the ghost should have any allusion to  rottenness  and  decay  fatness and stupidity being generally attended at least in this world with a tolerable share both of good health and of good fortune  p  Pol  Good sir  or so  or friend or gentleman  This is the reading of all the old copies and there is not a more plain simple certain  That it is the true reading is sufficiently proved by what Reynoldo a few lines lower says to Polonius who asks  Where did I leave  Rey  At closes in the consequence  At friend  or so  or gentleman  But this last line though certainly usefulthough printed in the  oliosis not taken the least notice of in this editorial specimen of accuracy and perfection  and intelligible line in these ten volumes nor one that has more exercised the attention and ingenuity of the learned and sagacious commentators Such readers as are better acquainted with Shakspeare than with the modern improvements upon him  will not be displeased to see a list of their several  emendations  Dr WARBURTON  Good sir or  sire  i e  father  Dr JOHNSON  Good sir  forsooth  or friend or gentleman  Mr STEEVENS  Good sir or  so forth  friend or gentleman  Mr TYRWHITT  Good sir  or sir  c  Each of these proposals is recommended by a long note and there is besides a  memoir  by the reverend and learned dr Percy upon the word  forsooth  Illustrious critics how much is the spir  t of Shakspeare

Fee  in this place says mr Steevens signifies  reward recompence  The word  annual  however might have inclined him to find some other meaning for it The king gave his nephew a  feud  or  see  in land of that yearly value The folio reads the line thus  Gives him  three thousand  crowns in annual fee  But mr Theobald and the present editors after him thinking  that  too little for a prince have very

the million 'twas  caviare  to the general  The discordant accounts given in this page will fully justify the following quotation from a writer of sense and veracity  "Caviare is made at Astracan of the rows of Sturgeon and Belluga a large fish about twelve or fifteen feet long without scales not unlike a sturgeon but more luscious and large his flesh is whiter than veal and more delicious than marrow Of these two fishes they take great numbers only for their rows sake which they salt and press and put up into casks some they send unpress'd and a little corn'd with salt being accounted a great dainty" Present state of Russia by dr Collins  mo  Hamlet seems to mean that the play like the pickled sturgeon was a delicacy for which the multitude had no  relish  and hereby pays the said multitude a compliment he did not intend since it is hard to say whether his tragedy or his caviare were the more strange and unnatural food  p  Ham  What's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba  That he should weep for her  Mr Upton and sir John Hawkins think this expression a plain allusion to a passage in Plutarchs life of Pelopidas which the latter has here quoted at length This story Shakspeare had undoubtedly read in sir Thomas Norths translation but that he here alludes to it is not equally apparent Hamlets observation merely relates as the players grief did to the bombast stuff about Hecuba which the latter had just done spouting  p  King  Her father and myself  lawful espials    "The words  lawful espials  are WANTING in the FOLIO STEEVENS"  This is not altogether so certain At

to be changed to  groan  merely because as he says  it can scarcely be borne by modern ears  Shakspeare may be so transmografyed how do your ears bear that dr Johnson and frittered away by his friendly editors in the course of a few years that if he were to rise from the dead he could not possibly know his own work  The  undiscover'd  country from whose bourn  No  traveller returns  It may still be a question how far dr Farmers note removes the force or ground of lord Orrcrys objection  A very simple person once observed that it is rather extraordinary for Hamlet to say that  no Traveler  had ever  returned  from this  undiscovered country  when he has a few moments before had a long conversation with the spirit of his father which had  returned from it  for the sole purpose of speaking to him  Pith  The quartos it seems have  pitch  which is certainly the better reading The allusion is to the  pitching  or throwing  the bar  a manly exercise usual in country villages  p

 And could of men distinguish her election  Sh'  hath seal'd thee  c  Distinguish her election  is no more than  make her election Distinguish of men  is exceeding harsh to say the best of it  p  Ham  O your only  jigmaker  Mr Steevens has clearly proved that  jig  in the authors time signifyed a ludicrous dialogue in metre or a common  ulgar ballad but he is as clearly wrong in asserting that it did not at that time signify a dance He may be satisfyed of the fact by onely turning over the next leaf from his own note  tumbling dauncing of  gigges  p b  Ham  let the devil wear black for I'll

seems and the second folio  pajecke  and another quarto  paicocke  Mr Theobald in a very long note contends that we should read  paddock  which he interprets a  Toad  As this is a most groundless and absurd conjecture mr Malonebelieves it to be the  true reading  Alas poor Shakspeare  Peacock  however is so certainly right that the very corruption of the old editions serves  to confirm it  the surname  Peacock  and most probably the bird itsself is still in many parts of the country called  Paike  A  paddock  is a  frog  Hamlets using that word  afterwards  is nothing to the purpose  here  A  peacock  means a creature of no value but for its gawdy trappings but Theobald is evidently right ins  upposing that it is onely substituted for the word  ass  p  Ham  Now might I do it pat now he

heaven  And that his soul may be as damn'd and black  As hell whereto it goes  "This speech" says dr Johnson "in which Hamlet represented as a virtuous character is not content with taking blood for blood but contrives damnation for the man that he would punish is too horrible to be read or to be uttered"  How far it detracts from the virtue of Hamlet to be represented as lying in wait for an opportunity to take an adequate and complete revenge upon the murderer of his father is a question not with submission to the great moralist quite so easyly decided The late king has reported hisself to have been destroyed in the most deliberate horrid and diabolical manner  Cut off ev'n in the blossom of his sin  Unhousel'd disappointed unaneal'd  No reckoning made but sent to his account  With all his imperfections on his head  O horrible O horrible most horrible  Under such aggravated circumstances for Hamlet to be content with having what dr Johnson calls blood for blood would have been taking an inadequate and imperfect revenge and consequently doing an act of injustice and impiety to the  manes  of his murdered parent But indeed the reasons Hamlet here gives for his conduct as they are better than any other person can make for him will fully justify both him and it against all such hypercritical opposition to the end of time  p  Ham  A bloody deedalmost as bad good mother  As kill a king and marry with his brother  Queen  As kill a king  This exclamation which mr Steevens thinks may be considered as some hint that the queen had no hand in her  husbands murder is as likely to proceed from  surprised guilt  as  conscious innocence  There is indeed no direct proof before us of her being accessory to the late kings death but his referring her punishment  to Heaven  And to those  thorns  that in her  bosomlodge  To  goad  and  sting  her  and her own confession of the  black and grained spots  she sees in her very soul  which will not leave their tinct  do surely render her share in that shocking transaction very  suspicious  p  Ham  Sense sure you have  Else could you not have  motion  but sure that sense  Is apoplex'd  This is certainly the true reading Hamlet means that the queen must have some kind of  sense  otherwise she could not walk about use her eyes hands  c  as she was every day seen to do Mr Malones note in which he explains  motion  by  libidinous inclination  instead of throwing light upon the passage does essential injury to it  p  Ham  A  vice  of kings  The  vice  says dr Johnson is a low mimick the foo of a farce from whom the modern  punch  is descended But with a  l proper deference to so good a judge in these ma  ters it is a much more probable conjecture that the facetious master  Punch  and  his wife Joan  are the trure re  entarives of those distinguished characters in the old m  steries  Pontius Pilate  and  his dreaming lady  The    as we elsewhere read had a  dagger of lath    i e  a sword of thin wood and is very likely the genuine ancestor of our more modern  Harlequin  The fool of the Christmas gambols in the North of Yorkshire is yet called the  Vice  p  Ham  For this same lord  I do repent but heaven hath pleas'd it so  To punish  him  with  me  and  me  with  him  This dr Johnson tells us is Hanmers reading the other editions have it  To punish  me  with  this  and  this  with  me  What thanks are due from every lover of Shakspeare to these worthy editors for their constant and successful edeavours to preserve his  genuine text  p  Ham  a pair of  reechy  kisses  Reechy  is here not  smoky  as mr Steevens interprets it but  dirty  and  greasy  like the appearance of a cookwenches face or chimneybacon This is likewise its meaning in  Coriolanus  The kitchen Malkin pins  Her richest lockram 'bout her  reechy  neck  p  King  The bark is ready and the wind at  help  i e  at hand ready ready to help or assist you Dr Johnson supposes it should be  the wind at  helm  p  King  And thou

be rhymed Perhaps he wrote  Howe'er my  hopes  my joys  are not begun JOHNSON"  "The folio reads in confirmation of dr Johnsons remark  Howe'er my haps my joys were ne'er begun STEEVENS"  This is true but is it not at the same time a conclusive proof either that dr Johnson never looked into the folio or that he has ascribed what he there found to his own sagacity  Something of this nature has been before observed Dr Johnsons captious readyness to question mr Theobalds integrity on similar though much more dubious occasions is a sufficient justification of truth and candour to dwell on circumstances which might perhaps otherwise have been left unnoticed  p  Oph  Tomorrow is St Valentines day  All in the morning betime  And I a maid at your window  To be your Valentine  Without doubt says dr Farmer  Good morrow  'tis  Saint Valentines day  The young lady comes to her sweethearts window  the day before  the choosing of  Valentines  is always the busyness of the vigil or eve  p  Oph

Steevens observes instead of  work  reads  would  And should not the present edition have done so Dr Johnson seems not to understand the passage the king says that the common people would turn Hamlets faults into virtues as strange a perversion adds he as that produced by the spring which changes wood to stone The learned and sagacious editor has a similar property but  his  alchemy only serves to convert  gold  to  lead  he has a very ready knack at changing the most perfect  sense  to the most absolute  nonsense  p  King  good Laertes  Will you do this keep close within your chamber  Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home  We'll put on those shall praise your excellence  And set a double varnish on the fame  The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together  And wager o'er your heads he being remiss  Most generous and free from all contriving  Will not peruse the foils so that with ease  Or with a little shuffling you may choose  A sword unbated and in a pass of practice  Requite him for your father  Laer  I will do't  And for the purpose I'll anoint my sword  I bought an unction of a mountebank  So mortal that but dip a knife in it  Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare  Collected from all simples tliat have virtue  Under the moon can save the thing from death  That is but scratch'd withal I'll touch my point  With this contagion that if I gall him slightly  It may be death  It is a matter of surprise that neither dr Johnson nor any other of Shakspeares numerous and able commentators has remarked with proper warmth and detestation the villainous assassinlike treachery of Laertes in this horrid plot There is the more occasion that he should be here pointed out an object of abhorrence as he is a character we are in some preceding parts of the play led to respect and admire  p  Ham  We must speak by  the card  or equivocation will undo us  To do any thing by the card  says dr Johnson is  to do if with nice observation  the  card  being according to him the paper on which the different points of the compass were described that is the compasspaper itsself But it is not The  card  is a  seachart  still so termed by mariners and the word is afterwards used by Osrick in the same sense Hamlets meaning will therefor be we must speak  directly foreward in a siraight line  plainly to the point  p  Osr  The king sir hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses against the which he has  impon'd  six French rapiers  c  To  impone  is certainly right and means to put down to stake from the verb  impono  To  depone  which dr Johnson  perhapses  it should be is the same as to  depose  to swear or give evidence upon oath as he might have concluded from the very passage he has quoted from Hudibras  p  Osr  The king sir hath lay'd that in a  dozen passes  between yourself and him he shall not  exceed  you  three hits  he hath lay'd on  twelve  for  nine  This wager dr Johnson candidly professes hisself unable to understand In a dozen passes he says one must exceed the other more or less than three hits nor can be comprehend how in a dozen there can be twelve to nine Mr Malone however with the assistance of a "slight correction already made by sir T Hanmer" thinks he has reconciled all difficulties By  a dozen passes between yourself and him  he understands a dozen passes  for each  The meaning then says he is"The king hath laid that in a dozen passes apiece between you and Laertes he shall not have the advantage of you by three hits  He  viz the king  hath laid on  the terms of Laertes making twelve hits  for nine  which you shall make"Or perhaps he adds the last  he  means Laertes and then it will run"  He  viz Laertes hath laid on terms of making  twelve hits  for  nine  which you shall make" This continues the ingenious critic just exceeds Hamlets number by three If therefor says he Laertes in his passes should make hits and Hamlet in his but the king would loseIf on the other hand Laertes should make but hits and Hamlet or Laertes and Hamlet his majesty would win  Mr Ma  one has evidently bestowed great pains in the above nice and accurate calculation And great is his praise as an ingenious commentator and a dexterous arithmetician It must therefor be with no small diffidence after so laborious and mathematical a discussion of this intricate subject which he has doubtless most satisfactoryly expounded and in the stile of his good old schoolmaster the venerable mr Cocker made plain to the meanest capacity that any anonymous scribbler should venture to question the radix of his figurative system and if that should unfortunately cause a demolition of the whole fabric alas the day  That a  dozen passes apiece  were NOT intended does evidentry appear from the ensuing scene in which the king previously to the encounter declares that  If Hamlet give the  first  or  second hit  Or quit in answer of the  third exchange  he will then drink his health It is clear from this that  Laertes  might get  these three hits  But in case either party no matter which were to be the sole assailant for the first twelve passes and the other stand altogether on the defensive as the ingenious commentators own idea allows one to suppose the kings proposal would be ridiculous and absurd for if  Hamlet  played  his  bouts first  Laertes  could not have a single  chance  out of passes or at least and on the contrary if  Laertes  took the lead there would be no possibility of  Hamlets  getting a  single hit  The ingenious c  itic takes it for granted that passes might be made without a bit on either side a conjecture for which there is not the slightest ground in the play each pass or number of passes seems to have been made for the purpose of getting the  hit  and did not end till the hit was given But let us  see how the parties behave in the trial scene "  Here they play  " each endeavouring we find to hit the other Hamlet gets the  first  and  second hits  and calls on his antagonist for the  third  bout praying him to  pass with his best violence  they play again La  rtes wounds Hamlet they become incensed change rapiers and Hamlet wounds Laertes There does not seem the least foundation for the ingenious hypothesis and calculation in the note the whole structure must therefor inevitably  a  l to the ground Had they played with coolness and supposing their skill equal the odds were and so we are to understand Osrick to in  favour of Hamlet  for Laertes to win must have got hits at the least whereas Hamlet would have won if he had onely got so that he had clearly the advantage of Laertes in point of number  three  whole passes or hits and the odds were to which is in the same arithmetical proportion as to in Hamlets favour before they begun to play This is Shakspeares meaning and renders the text clear and consistent throughout And it onely remains to be considered whether dr Johnson or mr Malone has understood the passage best  p  Laert  I am satisfy'd in nature  Whose motion in this case should stir me most  To my revenge but in my terms of honour  I stand aloof and will no reconcilement  Till by some elder masters of known honour  I have a view and precedent of peace  To keep my name ungor'd But till that time  I do receive your offer'd love like love  And will not wrong it  This mr Steevens says was a piece of satire on fantastical honour Though  nature  adds he is satisfyed yet  he will ask advice of older men of the sword whether  artificial honour  ought to be contented with Hamlets submission But in fact the passage is as little intended for a  satire  as the honour Laertes alludes to is  artificial  or  fantastical  The ingenious commentator does not surely mean to contend that  nature  and  honour  are one and the same thing The sentiments of Laertes and almost his very words would one may venture to say be adopted by men of  real honour  in similar circumstances in any country or in any age He is notwithstanding a treacherous and diabolical villain  p  Ham  Your grace hath laid  the adds  o'the  weaker side  Mr Malone for unluckyly as he did not understand the passage he found it would not in its present shape suit his ingenious hypothesis and curious calculations in a preceding page would have us read  Your grace hath laid  upon  the weaker side  But the text is perfectly right and neither requires nor admits of alteration The king had wagered on Hamlets part  six Barbary horses  against a few  rapiers poniards  c  i e  about  twenty  to  one  ODDS enough in all conscience And yet is this same mr Malone in another place so hardy as to assert that  no unequal stakes were laid  p  Ham  I am afraid you make a  wanton  of me  i e  you trifle with me as if you were playing with a child Dr Johnson onely observes that a  wanton  was a man feeble and effeminate He might as well have said it was a horse or an elephant  I would have thee gone  And yet no further than a  wantons  bird  That lets it hop a little from his hand  And with a silk thread pulls it back again  Romeo and Juliet  p  Hor  Now cracks a noble heart Good night sweet prince  And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest  Mr Steevenses note on this passage is so interesting and extraordinary that it becomes necessary to insert it here at large lest it might be thought to be partially or unfairly represented in the remarks which it has occasioned  "Let us review for a moment the behaviour of Hamlet on the strength of which Horatio founds this eulogy and recommends him to the patronage of angels  "Hamlet at the command of his father's ghost undertakes with seeming alacrity to revenge the murder and declares he will banish all other thoughts from his mind He makes however but one effort to keep his word and that is when he mistakes Polonius for the king On another occasion he defers his purpose till he can find an opportunity of taking his uncle when he is least prepared for death that he may insure damnation to his soul Though he assassinated Polonius by accident yet he deliberately procures the execution of his schoolfellows Rosencrantz and Guildenstern who appear to have been unacquainted with the treacherous purposes of the mandate they were employed to carry Their death as he declares in a subsequent conversation with Horatio gives him no concern for they obtruded themselves into the service and he thought he had a right to destroy them He is not less accountable for the distraction and death of Ophelia He  comes to interrupt the funeral designed in honour of this lady at which both the king and queen were present and by such an outrage to decency renders it still more necessary for the usurp  r to lay a second stratagem for his life though the first had proved abortive He comes to insult the brother of the dead and to boast of an affection for his sister which before he had denied to her face and yet at this very time must be considered as desirous of supporting the character of a madman so that the openness of his confession is not to be imputed to him as a virtue He apologizes to Horatio afterwards for the absurdity of this behaviour to which he says he was provoked by that nobleness of fraternal grief which indeed he ought rather to have applauded than condemned Dr Johnson has observed that to bring about a reconciliation with Laertes he has availed himself of a dishonest fallacy and to conclude it is obvious to the most careless spectator or reader that he kills the king at last to revenge himself and not his father  "Hamlet cannot be said to have pursued his ends by very warrantable means and if the poet when he sacrificed him at last meant to have enforced such a moral it is not the worst that can be deduced from the play for as  Maximus  in Beaumont and Fletchers  Valentinian  says  "Although his justice were as white as truth  "His way was crooked to it that condemns him"  "The late dr Akinside once observed to me that the conduct of Hamlet was every way unnatural and indefensible unless he were to be regarded as a young man whose intellects were in some degree impaired by his own misfortunes by the death of his father the loss of expected sovereignty and a sense of shame resulting from the hasty and incestuons marriage of his mother  "I have dwelt the longer on this subject because Hamlet seems to have been hitherto regared as a hero not undeserving the pity of the audience and because no writer on Shakespeare has taken the pains to point out the immoral tendency of his character"  There are very few it is believed at all acquainted with this inimitable author who would not be surprised nay astonished at such a severe and unexpected attack upon his principal and most favourite character a character every one has been hitherto led to admire and esteem not more by universal and long established opinion than by the sentiments and feelings of his own mind To find the amiable the injured the distracted and unfortunate Hamlet represented as a worthless and immoral being totally undeserving of the least pity from those almost numberless audiences whom the united force of Nature Shakspeare and Garrick has compelled to weep for his misfortunes and whose compassion would not be less in the closet than in the theatre seems the most extraordinary and irreconcilable proceeding in a writer of genius and learning that can be well imagined However as the heavy charges which are here brought against him will upon the slightest examination appear to be groundless unwarrantable and unjust there is little reason to fear that the confidence and ingenuity with which they are advanced and supported will answer the purpose of the learned objector  Hamlet the onely child of the late king upon whose death he became lawfully intitled to the crown had it seems ever since that event been in a state of melancholy owing to excessive grief for the suddenness with which it had taken place and an indignant horror at his mothers speedy and incestuous marriage The spirit of the king his father appears and makes him acquainted with the circumstances of his untimely  fate which he excites him to  revenge  this Hamlet engages to do an engagement it does not appear he ever forgot It behoved him however to conduct hisself with the greatest prudence The usurper was powerful and had Hamlet carryed his design into immediate execution it could not but have been attended with the worst consequences to his own life and fame No one knew what the ghost had imparted to him till he afterwards made Horatio acquainted with it and though his interview with the spirit gave him certain proof and satisfactory reason to know and detest the usurper it would scarcely in the eye of the people have justifyed his killing their king To conceal and at a convenient time to effect his purpose he counterfeits madness and for his greater assurance puts the spirits evidence and the usurpers guilt to the test of a play by which the truth of each is manifested He soon after espies the usurper at prayers but resolves and with great justice resolves not to kill him in the very moment when he might be making his peace with heaven inasmuch as a death so timed would have been rather a happyness than a punishment and by no means a proper revenge for his fathers murder We next find him in the queens apartment endeavouring to make her sensible of the state of vice and horror into which her unnatural connection with the usurper had plunged her At the beginning of this conference he mistakes Polonius who was  behind the arras  and about to alarm the household for the usurper and under that apprehension stabs him The spirit appears not very necessaryly perhaps "to whe  his almost blunted purpose" He is immediately sent off to England and in his passage discovers the treacherous and fatal purpose of the commission with which his companion and pretended friends were charged These men he  knew had eagerly solicited and even thrust theirselves upon this employment and he had of course sufficient reason to conclude that they were well acquainted with the nature and purport of their fatal packet That Shakspeare meant to charge them with this knowlege and to represent them as  participes criminis  is evident from the old black letter  Hystorie  which furnished him with the subject where they are not only made privy to but actually  devise  the scheme to take Hamlets life His own safety depended on their removal and at such a time and under such circumstances he would have been fully justifyed in using any means to procure it  That he is "accountable for the distraction and death of Ophelia" is a most strange charge indeed He had to be sure accidentally killed her father whom he  took for his betters  This causes her distraction and her distraction causes her death A most lamentable train of circumstances and with which the moral character of Hamlet is as little concerned at that of the ingenious though uncandid commentator  That "he comes to interrupt the funeral designed in honour of this lady" is an assertion which has nothing but the credit of the asserter to support it Walking with his friend Horatio through a churchyard he enters into conversation with a gravedigger but presently observing the approach of a funeral procession he says to Horatio to whom he was then speaking  Soft soft aside Here comes the king  The queen the courtiers  Who is this they follow  And with such maimed rites  This doth betoken  The corse they follow did with desperate hand  Fordo its own life 'Twas of some estate  Couch we a while and mark  Does it appear from hence that he knew or had the least reason to suspect this to be the funeral of Ophelia or even that he was apprised of her distraction or unfortunate death The contrary is most certain He left the  ingdom before her insanity broke out and does not return till after she is dead he has seen no one except Horatio who was certainly unacquainted with the latter circumstance so that it is next to an impossibility that he could have known what had happened to her But to proceed Laertes asking  what ceremony else  Hamlet observes to Horatio  That is Laertes a very noble youth  Laertes concluding his expostulation about the further honours with the following beautyful lines  lay her i'the earth  And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  May violets springI tell thee churlish priest  A ministring angel shall  my sister  be  When thou liest howling  Hamlet exclaims  What the fair Ophelia  His surprise and astonishment on hearing Laertes name his sister are manifestly apparent and may serve to convince the learned critic and every one who has been misled by his illfounded accusations that Hamlet does NOT come to interrupt the funeral and is guilty of NO outrage whatever He as little "comes to insult the brother of the dead" or "to boast of an affection for his sister which before he had in a wild and careless manner when he was under the necessity of  counterfeiting madness  denied to her face" Laertes bids  Treble woe  Fall ten times treble on that cursed head  Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense  Depriv'd thee of  an execration Hamlet cannot but perceive to be pointed at hisself Having uttered this curse Laertes hastyly and in direct violation of all decorum jumps into the grave where he "rants and mouths it" like a player This outrageous proceeding seems to infect Hamlet who forgetting hisself as he afterward with sorrow owns to Horatio and by the "bravery" of the others grief being worked up "into a towering passion" leaps in after him and he who thinks Hamlets madness or sincerity counterfeit here does not appear to know so much of Shakspeare or of human nature as every one who reads this play ought to do  The affection Hamlet now boasts for Ophelia was genuine and violent we find him with the very same sentiments in the beginning of the play and he has never once disowned it except on a single occasion when the sacrifice was required by his assumed character a circumstance which cannot at least ought not to be imputed to him as a crime  The behaviour and language of Laertes is more ranting and unnatural than noble and pathetic and with his execration upon Hamlet previously to his leaping into the grave and the violent shock which Hamlet might feel on learning the corse to be Ophelias might easyly work up to and apologise for a higher pitch of extravagance a stronger and more composed mind than that of which Hamlet appears to have been then master  Hamlets conversation with Laertes immediately before the fencing scene was at the queens earnest intreaty and though dr Johnson be pleased to give it the harsh name of "a dishonest fallacy" there are better because more natural judges who consider it as a most gentle and pathetic  address and cannot perceive it to be either dishonest or fallacious for certainly Hamlet did not intend the death of  Polonius  of consequence unwittingly and by mere accident injured Laertes who after declaring that he was "satisfyed in nature" and that he onely delayed his perfect reconcilement till his honour were satisfyed by elder masters whom at the same time for he has the instrument of death in his hand he never meant to consult says  Till that time  I do receive your offer'd LOVE LIKE LOVE  And WILL NOT WRONG IT  On which the truely virtuous innocent and unsuspecting Hamlet replies  I embrace it freely  And will this BROTHERS wager frankly play  Let the conduct and sentiments of Laertes in this interview and in his conversation with the usurper together with his villainous design against the life of Hamlet be examined and tryed by any rules of gentility honour or humanity natural or artificial he must be considered as a treacherous cowardly diabolical wretch Is such a character to rise on the fall of the generous Hamlet  Things are sometimes obvious to very careless spectators or readers which are not discerned by those who play closer attention to the scene Hamlet in a trial of skill with Laertes receives an unexpected a treacherous and mortal wound Immediately before the company enter he appears to be much troubled in mind his spirits foreboding what was to happen "If it be now" says he "'tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readyness is all"  He does not appear to have suspected Laertes of any unfair practice he did not know so much of him as we do but he had every reason to expect treachery and murder from the usurper he might too have heared something of his secret juggling with Laertes and doubtless intended to revenge the death of his father Being thus wounded and on the threshold of futurity if he had not killed the usurper immediately the villain would have escaped unpunished But he does not stab him for his treachery toward hisselfhe upbraids him with his crimes of INCEST and MURDER and consigns him to the infernal regions  With all his 'rank offences' thick upon him  So that he sufficiently revenges his father his mother who by the way dyes if not deservedly at least unpityed and hisself As to his own fall every reader or spectator must sympathise with Horatio for the untimely loss of a youthful prince possessed of such great and amiable qualities rendered miserable by such unparalleled misfortunes  For he was likely had he been put on  To have prov'd most royally  and who falls a sacrifice to the most base and infernal machinations His death however is not to be looked upon as a punishment the most innocent as Shakspeare well knew are frequently confounded with the most guilty and the virtues of Hamlet were to be rewarded among those angels which his friend Horatio invokes to escort him to everlasting rest  Dr Akenside was a very ingenious sensible and worthy man but enough has been said to satisfy those who doubt that the conduct of Hamlet is neither unnatural nor indefensible That his intellects were really impaired by the circumstances enumerated by the above learned physician  is very probable and indeed Hamlet hisself more than once plainly insinuates it See in particular the latter part of his soliloquy at the end of the second act  The opposing and refuting of general charges by proof and circumstance commonly requires much more time and space than the making of them The writer is sensible that the arguments here adduced are neither arranged so judiciously nor expressed so well as the objections of the learned commentator but from what has been said and as it is said it will appear that it has not been without strong and sufficient reasons that Hamlet has "been hitherto regarded as a hero not undeserving the pity of the audience" and the ingenious critic will not perhaps have much cause to congratulate hisself on being the onely person who has taken pains to point out the  immoral tendency  of as noble as virtuous and as interesting a character  As e'er 'imagination' cop'd withall  p  Hor  So shall you hear  Of  cruel  bloody and unnatural acts  Thus says mr Collins the more modern editors The first quarto and the folio adds he readOf  carnal  c referring he supposes to the usurpers criminal intercourse with the mother of Hamlet  Carnal  is without doubt the true reading but nothing can be more indecent ridiculous and absurd than the construction here put upon it Was the relationship between the usurper and the deceased king a secret confined to Horatio All the world must have been apprised of it The word is used by Shakspeare as an adjective to  carnage  OTHELLO  p  Iago  Three great ones of the city  In personal suit to make me his lieutenant  Oft capp'd  to him  Offcapp'd  in the folio is certainly the true reading That of the text is nonsense  p  Iago  One Michael Cassio a Florentine  A fellow almost damn'd in a  fair wife  This passage is too stubborn for any but a master critic to attack and those who have hitherto attempted it have little reason to boast of their success Sir Thomas Hanmer reads  fair phyz  which dr Warburton calls a "Whitefriers phrase" and thinks Iago is repeating Othellos own words alluding to him Mr Steevens seems gently to incline to Theobalds notion that the fair wife was Iagos Dr Johnson according to his usual custom when there is real difficulty in a passage has nothing to propose Mr Tollet thinks one might read  salse wife  Mr Tyrwhitt believes the true reading is  fair life  Mr Steevens in a subsequent note observes that  almost damn'd in a wife  can onely be said of a man who is near being marryed thinking it seems that a man actually marryed is not  almost  but  altogether damn'd  It is however settled that Cassio is the Florentine and evident that  wise  can never be the true word since he neither is marryed nor till some time after has any connection with a woman at least to our knowlege  Mr Tyrwhitt seems to have come the nearest to what we may conceive to be Iagos meaning and as his emendation does so little violence to the text the editors would certainly have been justifiable in adopting it  p  Bra  What tell'st thou me of robbing this is Vonice  My house is not a  grange  That is says mr Warton you are in a populous city not in a  lone house  where a robbery might easily be committed  One is always glad to read the notes of this very ingenious and fancyful writer since if one does not meet with information one may be sure of entertainment "  You  " he makes Brabantio say to Iago and Rodorigo "are in a populous City  not  in a  lone house  "They are  standing in the  STREET See as to  Grange  before p  p  Bra  With the Moor say'st thouWho would be a father  How did'st thou know 'twas sheO  thou deceiv'st me  Past thoughtwhat said she to you  Thus says mr Steevens the quarto The folio and the quartos and he adds read  O she deceives me  Past thought  "I" continues he "have chosen the apostrophe to his absent daughter as the most spirited of the two readings"  It may be the most spirited but it is surely the least natural It is not at all in Brabantios manner and is with as much probability an errour of the press as an apostrophe to his daughter Be that however as it may the majority  and weight of evidence is in favour of the other reading which is more likely to be Shakspeares own and should therefor be restored  p  Iago  He's married  Cas  To who  Iago  Marry toCome captain will you go  Mr Steevens thinks it singular that Cassio should ask the question as it appears he knew of Othellos courtship from first to last But it is very easy to imagine that Cassio might wish to know if Iago were acquainted with the lady to prevent the latters suspecting that  he  was  p  Bra  That thou hast practis'd on her with foul charms  Abus'd her delicate youth with drugs or minerals  That  weaken motion  Mr Theobald reads  That weaken  notion HANMER  That  waken  motion  a notion to which mr Steevens inclines Mr Malone knows not which to prefer he is for both and neither  To  weaken motion  isto  impair the faculties  It was till very lately and may with some be still an opinion that philtres or lovepotions have the power of perverting and of course weakening or impairing both the sight and judgement and of procuring fondness or dotage toward any unworthy object who administers them And by  motion  Shakspeare means the senses which are depraved and weakened by these fascinating mixtures  p  Bra  She is abus'd stol'n from me and corrupted  By  spells and medicines bought of mountebanks  Dr Warburton cites a Venetian statute against those who sold love potions of which mr Steevens believes Shakspeare knew no more than he does he however supposes him to have been "well acquainted with the edicts of that sapient prince king James the first against  practisers  Of arts inhibited and out of warrant"  But there is no doubt that Shakspeare had the substance of Brabantios speech from Cinthios novel however he might come by it and Cinthio it may be supposed knew something of the Veneti  n statute As to the  edict  against these practices by James I it may be fairly presumed that his sapiency had just about as much concern in its fabrication as if wisdom and learning be as criminal as it is rare in a great king a somewhat less sapient successor of his had in its repeal  p  Oth  That I would all my pilgrimage dilate  Whereof by parcels she had something heard  But not  intentively  Thus says mr Steevens the eldest quarto The folio he adds reads  instinctively  Perhaps continues he it should be  distinctively  a word which if he had looked into the second third or fourth folio or into any subsequent edition prior to dr Johnsons he would there have found  p  Iago  If fanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an  erring barbarian  and a  supersubtle Venetian  be not too hard for my wits  c  Here is a collection of quibbles By an  erring Barbarian  he means not onely a  roving moor  but a  shallow blundering brute  and this character he sets in opposition to that of a  supersubtle Venetian woman  The vow he concluded must needs be frail that was made between two such unnatural extremes as brutal folly and the most refined female cunning  p  Des  O fie upon thee slanderer  This short speech mr Steevens says is in the quarto unappropriated and may as well belong to  AEmilia  as to  Desdemona  It is given to Desdemona in both the folios and to her it most certainly belongs  p  Iago  What an eye she has methinks it founds  a parley of provocation  Cas  An inviting eye and yet methinks right modest  Iago  And when she speaks is it not an  alarum to love  The  voice  says dr Johnson may  sound  an  alarum  more properly than the  eye  can  sound  a  parley  The  eye  is often said to  speak  Thus we frequently hear of the  language  of the  eye  Surely that which can  talk  may without any violent stretch of the figure be allowed to  sound a parley  The folio reads  parley  to  provocation  Pheere  or  fere  is as entirely different from  peer  as one word can be from another the former implying a partner companion mate sweetheart husband or wife  Peers  and  compeers  may signify  equals  and in that sense  fellows  but this is not the language of a balladmaker The term  worthy fellow  would be poorly explained by  honest equal  But why should we thus endeavour to make difficulties where we find none Every person one may venture to say who has hitherto read the line will understand it to mean by a very common inversion of language  King Stephen was a worthy  lord  The term is not confined to this passage we have it in the  Tempest  O  king  Stephano O  peer  O worthy Stephano  Spenser uses  peer  continually for  lord  and one might quote a multitude of similar instances from old books but to what purpose  Ibi  With that he called the taylor  lown  "Sorry fellow paltry wretch JOHNSON" Rather  knave rascol  p  Iage  I do not knowfriends all but now even now  In quarter  and in terms like bride and groom  In quarter  that is according to dr Johnson "in their quarters at their lodging" But it should rather mean  at peace quiet  or as the learned critic elsewhere explains it "in friendship amity concord" They had been on that very spot the court or platform it is presumed before the  castle ever since Othello left them which can scarcely be called being  in their quarters  or  at their lodging  And indeed they could not have left it without being guilty of another offence as they were directed by Othello to keep the watch  p  Clown  Then put up your pipes in your bag  for I'll away  go vanish into air away  This must be wrongpossibly Shakspeare wrote  fly away  p  Des  What Michael Cassio  That came a wooing with you  And yet in the first act says mr Steevens Cassio appears perfectly ignorant of the amour and is indebted to Iago for the information of Othellos marriage and of the person to whom he is marryed  The ingenious critic will perhaps find his observation a little too hasty Cassios  appearing  or  pretending  to be ignorant of the above circumstances is in the first place no conclusive proof that he  actually was so  and secondly if the learned writer will take the trouble of referring to the passage he alludes to he will perceive that Cassio is  not  indebted to Iago for the information "of the person to whom Othello is married"  p  Oth  They are  close delations  working from the heart  Dr Warburton reading and defending  cold dilations  "I know not" says dr Johnson "why the modern editors are  satisfied with this reading They might easily have found that it is introduced without authority The old copies UNIFORMLY give  close dilations  except that the earlier quarto has  close denotements  which was the authors first expression afterwards changed by him not to  cold dilations  for  cold  is read in NO ANCIENT COPY but to  close delations c  "  Now would any one suppose that after this confidence  cold dilations  should be the reading of the second third and fourth folios But it is actually the case How naturally does indolence produce errour  p  Iago  I do beseech you  Though Iperchance am vicious in my guess  that your wisdom yet  From one that so imperfectly conceits  Would take no notice c  This passage is printed and explained as if what should have followed after the words  though I  were broken off by the speaker designedly But it is not His words and meaning are altogether plain and simple  I beeseech you  says he to Ot  ello  though I may be too shrewd and vicious in my guess  i e as mr Steevens well explains it apt to put the worst construction on this matter  that you would not from my imperfect surmises take further notice of it  p  Iago  O beware my lord of jealousy  It is the greeney'd monster which doth mock  The meat it feeds on  The term  greeney'd monster  seems to refer onely to  Jealousy  and  meek  doubtless in this instance signifies to  loath Suspicion  is the  food  which may be said to support  jealousy  and  this very food the  jealous person  loaths and detests though he is not able to withstand the anxiety with which his mind pursues and devours it Dr Smollet had perhaps this very passage in his eye when he made one of the characters in his  Regicide  say  let me rot  A loathsome banquet  to the fowls of heaven  p  Oth  'Tis not to make me jealous  To saymy wife is fair feeds well loves company  Is free of speech sings plays and dances well  Where virtue is these are  more  virtuous  "I know not" says mr Steevens "why the modern editors in opposition to the first quarto and folio read  most  instead of  more  "  They had two reasons  The sense requires  most  And  It is the reading of the second folio  p  Iago  Foh one may smell in such a  will most rank  Will  says dr Johnson is for  wilfulness  A  rank will  adds he is  selfwill  overgrown and exuberant To SMELL  wilfulness  and an  overgrown selfwill  is a faculty peculiar to the learned critic But with all imaginable deference to him the expression means  inclinations  or  desires  most  foul gross  and  strongscented  p  Oth  A liberal hand the hearts of old gave hands  But our  new heraldry  is  hands  not hearts  Without it can be proved that this play existed in its present shape prior to the institution of the order of baronets one may pretty safely admit that this passage contains an allusion to the arms allotted them But that Shakspeare intended to sneer at the establishment or had such a refined and complex meaning as dr Warburton would contend is not quite so obvious As to the inconsistency of Othellos acquaintance with an English honour of the writers own time every play abounds with similar instances  SUPPLEMENT  VOLUME THE FIRST  p  Widow Dido  Perhaps says the industrious editor there is here an allusion to some old ballad In the  Pepysian  collection adds he is one to the tune of  Queen Dido  If the learned commentator had consulted that collection he might have found the ballad of Queen Dido itsself But it is rather extraordinary that he should not know that it was printed in Percys Reliques  This ballad appears to have been at one time a great favourite with the common people "Oh you aleknights" exclaims an ancient writer "you that deuoure the marrow of the Mault and drinke whole Aletubs into consumptions that sing QUEENE DIDO ouer a Cupp and tell strange newes ouer an Ale pot c" Jacke of Douer his Quest of Inquirie or his priuy search for the veriest Foole in England Lon to  fig    p  Nor  scrape trencher  nor wash dish  "It should be remembered" says one of mr Malones mushroom assistants in this notable piece of editorial cookry "that trenchers which in the time of our author were generally used were  cleansed  by  scraping  ONLY and were  never washed  They were  scraped  daily" continues he "till they were  entirely worn away  " An assertion as ridiculous as untrue The scraping of a trencher is merely preparatory and conducive to its being thoroughly  washed  and  scoured  If  scraping  had been the  sole  and  dayly  process these lasting and serviceable utensils would not onely have been soon entirely scraped away but have scarcely been fit to eat off a second time And if mr White the trencherscraper in the note have been used onely to scrape and never to wash his trenchers one cannot well envy his guests the luxury of  fouling a plate with him  p  Val  Not mine my gloves are  on  Speed  Why then this may be yours for this is but  one  From this quibble mr Malone conjectures that the word  one  was anciently pronounced as if it were written  on  That this was the ancient and original pronunciation is very probable as appears from the word  only  onely and the vulgar usage in many counties at this day But that it was not the general practice in our authors time is evident from the following passages  Much ado about 'lothing  act V scene i  Nor let no comforter delight mine ear  But such A ONE whose wrongs do suit with mine  Macbeth  act IV scene iv  There's not A ONE of them but in his house  I keep a servant see'd  A love letter of Henry the eighth to Anna Bullen printed by Hearne at the end of Robert de Avesbury will clearly shew the pronunciation of that period  "As touching a lodging for you we have gotten WON by my lord Cardinals means  c  "  Mr Malone on another occasion v observed to mr Steevens "that  ere  and o  are perpetually confounded in the old copies of our author" The learned gentleman probably made this observation before he had ever looked into an old copy or he has discovered a  perpetual confusion  of which it would be difficult for any other person to find a single instance  p  Thou common friend  that's  without faith or love  That's  says mr Malone is here used for  id est that is to say  Seriously And does not the ingenious critic think there is  almost  as much reason for supposing it to be used instead of  that art  p    that young Hamlet was born  By this scene judge Blackstone observes it appears that Hamlet was then thirty years old And yet says he in the beginning of the play he is spoken of as a  very young  man one that designed to go back to school  i e  to the university of Wittenberg The poet in the fifth act he thinks had forgot what he wrote in the first  In fact however the poet has forgot nothing neither is there any reason to suppose the least inconsistency in the matter men may study or reside at the university to  any age  ADDITIONAL NOTES  VOLUME THE SIXTH  KING HENRY THE FIFTH  p  K Henry  Send for him good  uncle  "John Holland duke of Exeter was married to Elizabeth the kings aunt STEEVENS"  It is very true but the learned commentator should have added that he had been deprived of the title and  beheaded  by Henry IV The nobleman to whom the king now addresses hisself is Thomas Beaufort earl of Dorset who was indeed created duke of Exeter but not till some years after the time of this conference  THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH  p  Queen  A crown for Yorkand lords bow low to him  Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on  Putting a paper crown on his head  Shakspeare mr Steevens observes has on this occasion deviated from history The paper crown he says was not placed on the duke of Yorks head till after it had been cut off  The ingenious commentator is most certainly mistaken Shakspeare so far from having deviated from history has  followed it with the utmost precision Whethamstede expressly tells us that the Lancastrians in direct breach of a mutual agreement and before the day appointed for the battle fell suddenly upon the dukes army and took him and the earl of Salisbury prisoners treating both but especially the duke in the most shameful manner  Nam  says he  statuentes eum super unum parvum formicarium colliculum quoddam sertum vile ex palustri gramine confectum imponentes per modum coronae super capud suum non aliter quam Ju  aei coram Domino incurvaverunt genua sua coram ipso dicentes illuserie  Ave rex sine regimine Ave rex absque hereditate Ave dux p  inceps absque omni populo penitus possessione  Et hiis una cum aliis variis in eum probrose opprobri  seque dictis coegerunt ipsum demum per capitis abscisionem clameum relinquere suae justiciae vendicacionis  p Not a single circumstance is omitted or varyed in the scene It is not however imagined that Shakspeare had ever consulted Whethamstede he found the same story no doubt in some old black letter chronicle which it has not been the writers fortune to meet with or he might possibly have it from popular tradition  THE END  THE GENUINE TEXT OF SHAKSPEARE  Preparing for the Press  AN EDITION OF THE PLAYS OF WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE WITH NOTES  THIS edition will be comprised in eight duodecimo volumes and will be carefully and accurately printed from the onely copies of real authority the two first folios But although these editions will be the standard of the intended work such passages in the old quartos as may appear to have been omitted by accident or with a view to shorten the representation and every various reading will be maturely considered and if worthy of insertion be adopted either in the text or margin as their importance or merit may seem to require No variation however will be made from the standard editions  without apprising the reader of it unless the difference should consist merely in a slight typographical error Nor is any difference between the various editions in other respects intended to be otherwise than occasionally regarded The orthography will be reduced with the utmost care to a modern and uniform system except where a change would be injurious to the authors sense and meaning Various or doubtful readings will be settled from an attentive examination of the sentiments of every commentator The notes which will be very sparingly introduced and never but where they seem absolutely necessary or peculiarly proper will be chiefly extracted under the names of their respective authors from the editions of Theobald Warburton Johnson and Steevens but not to the exclusion of better though perhaps anonymous intelligence if it can be given It is however no part of the editors design to fill his margin with a view of the corruptions or a refutation of the errors of preceding commentators  The authors life with the usual documents particularly a more exact copy of his will than has been yet published and the prefaces of his various editors will be prefixed to to the work which will likewise be attended with a new copious and accurate glossary And in an additional volume it is proposed to give a complete verbal index adapted to the intended edition  This edition will with regard to the correctness of the text be infinitely superior to any that has yet appeared It will possess all the advantages of every former edition and be as little liable it is hoped as possible to the defects of any  th April
