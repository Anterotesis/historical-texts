Simple Elves  And shew the Race of  Triflers  in  our Selves  For this unmindful of the  Cynic Tribe  The  Wrinkled Forehead  or th'  illnatur'd Gibe  Dauntless  We Deign to face th' unruly  Pit  So famed for Clamour Petulance and Wit  Merits  our own  from no Peculiar Cause  Therefore be Sure we have  our own  Applause  Heedless of what the selfish  Miser  say's  We venture  Sense  for  Poverty

DIALOGUE BETWEEN A  Sea Captain  and his  Friend  in Town  Gent  WELL met noble Captain you're wellcome on Shore  Pray when did you land  Capt  last Night  Gent  Not before  Capt  No by  Gd  'twas a wonder I landed so soon  For the Wind has blown hard since the change of the Moon  Gent  Pray what News do you bring from the  African  Coast  Capt  Why good News I thinkI had surely been lost  If NEPTUNE the  Sovereign God of the Seaâ–ª  Had  not  interpos'd twixt EOLUS and ME  But what's the most talk'd of in this famous City  Where the PEOPLE are all  so polite  and  so witty  So extensive the Place it must  something  afford  Gent  Why faith honest Captain I know not a Word  That's worth my relating yet list and you'l hear  Tho' 'twill rather  chagrine  you than  please  you I fear  Our GENTRY of late  to their Honour be't spoke  Who think themselves wiser than all other Folk  Have  acted  like People  bereft of their Senses  For  Gentility's lost  when the  Player commences  Capt  The  Player commences  Why what do you mean  Gent  Have Patience good Captain I'll open the Scene  You must know that in  London  some  People  there are  So fond of the Greatness that waits on a Play'r  That at once  they turn'd  ACTORS  themselves to expose  To the  Pity of Friends  and the  Censure of Foes  Capt  Lord  what  cou'd induce them such  Madmen  to be  Gent  Oh you know the French Phrase  a la Mode de Paris  Sir the  French  have perform'd  Alluding to an account in the Paper of a Play perform'd by Some young Noblemen in France    Capt    oh then 'tis all well  The  English must follow them THO' 'TWERE TO HELL  Where if  Cerberus  did not the  French Men  affright  But would let them go visit the  Regions  of  Night    Each  Monkey  would after them like a  Brave Fellow  Gent  As  they've  done now by  playing the Fool  and OTHELLO  There's a  Fable  I learn'd it at School Years ago  I'll relate it I think it is  quite apropo  On a Time as Fame says the  Apes acted a Play  Tho I know not the Date of the Year or the Day  Nor is it material since it was enacted  And For  Apes  'twas done better than could be Expected  The  Asses  Soon heard on't and  they  must Needs try  Yet they used this Precaution that  None should be by  But Those Who Were  really Asses  indeed  For says they they may Laugh if we do not Succeed  But our  Gentry  So  Confident bold  and  Conceited  Ne'ver used this Precaution But Fairly admitted  An  Audience of Critics  To See their Fine  Play  Capt  Then the Asses In Fact Acted wiser than They  Pray How Was't Receiv'd were the  Hearers  quite  Civil  Gent  Ay  or else the  Whole Play  had Gone  Souse to the Devil  Good Manners  Obliged them  Somtimes  to applaud  Tho they Little Deserv'd it    Capt    I Believe so by Gd  And Pray  What expence  Might attend  this Affair  Gent  Why  FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS  our papers declare  Capt  Fifteen Hundred  D'ye Say Why Gd Dam my Blood  So much Money Spent to do no Sort of Good  How much more Commendable would it have been  Since Objects of Pity So frequent are seen  With benevolent Hands to have giv'n it to Those  And not paid so dearly themselves to expose  Gent  Faith Captain you're right  my  Opinion's the same  For in  every Respect  they are  greatly to blame  Now  if  I was an Actor  this Method  I'd take  The  Stage  and its  Drudgery  both I'd  forsake  Turn  GENTLEMAN  now  as the GENTRY  turn Players  And  exhibit a Taste  far  genteeler than  THEIRS  EPILOGUE  WHY what a Trick they've play'd me here egad  Pray is'nt it enough to make one  Mad  Such idle Things these Men  Dull dronish Rogues  To make us  tender Souls  speak Epilogues  But yet I partly guess what they're about  And faith I'll tell  for Wit and Truth will out  You  too may guessbut this I know the Case is  The Chaps are all  asham'd to shew their Faces  But shame's th'  Effect of Guilt  it is most certain  No wonder then they've  sneak'd behind the Curtain  And send me here to gild a dirty Cause  To tickle your goodnatures for Applause  If I don't mawl 'em for't Let them mawl me  I'll teach the scurvy Knaves Civillity  Well but good Audience did you like the Play  Ha now you shake your Heads  and well you may  For sure  such Wretches  never trod the Stage  Unless it were to  lull  a  nodding Age  Well for my Part it pleas'd me to the Life  To hear Othllo bawl so for his Wife  Wife what Wife  he  had  a  Wife  last Summer  And has so still  He's only parted from her  But that's a ctly Faultno more of That  They both consented so 'twas  Tit  for  Tat  Suppose he  had  lost her  why  this mighty Pother  His  Monkey Ft  can help him to  another  But soft methinks I hear him rave behind  Bear witness all  he swears he'll beat me blind  Why let the great and mighty Hero come  And beat his Fillhe cannot beat me Dumb  I'll have my Way in spite of Friends or Foes  I've said no more than what the Audience knows  FINIS  N B  On  Monday  Noon next will be publish'd the
