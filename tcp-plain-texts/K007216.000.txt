Aur  UNDONE ruined and undone past redemption  Leon  I wish you had not writ that letter to Don  Carlos  to desire him to come back to Madrid  Aur  Who could divine that my brother would return from Naples without giving me any notice of his intention and that he should come at so critical a juncture  Leon  Well Ma'am I always thought your writing to Don Carlos would come to no good  Aur  Let me

writ me word that in the month of April last you left your lodgings with Don  Alonzo  nephew to Don  Guzman  and that while you were walking together on the Prado Don  Carlos  came up charged him

servant the word and he has dogged him and his man to a little inn  D Ped  You are positive you saw Don  Carlos  D Fer  Positive Now as I am shortly to be married to my cousin it is highly incumbent upon me to render myself acceptable to my uncle and I am certain I can do nothing more likely to please him than taking vengance on Don  Carlos  I therefore expect that you will accompany me to the place where the servant is ready to lead us  D Ped  Most willingly  Lopez  my sword Is your man below  D Fer  He waits at the door to conduct us  D Ped  Sister    Enter  Aurora  and  Leonarda  I shall

pleasure of seeing you once again  Aur  Oh  Carlos Carlos  my brother arrived here from Italy yesterday  D Car  Your brother  Aur  I had no notice of his coming otherwise I should have apprised you that you might have deferred your journey at least for some time  D Car  It will be impossible for me to stay in your house then  Aur  Not soI have prepared a retreat for you where his utmost cunning will never be able to find you  Musk  Ay Ma'am but the constables  Leon  Nor they neitherhear my lady out  Aur  This house consists like many others in Madrid but of two stories the upper I occupy myself the lower which on my father's death I found I had no occasion for I let to one Octavio a winemerchant on this division of the building a back staircase which made the communication between the two stories with a small closet adjoining became useless and by mutual  consent was stopped up by a partition on the side of the apartment below as well as on this When I had thoughts of bringing you back to Madrid it occurred to me that the partition on my side might again be secretly opened and prepared in such a manner as would effectually screen you from any search should it ever be suspected that you were in the house accordingly the thing is done  pushes back a pannel  and this moveable pannel will when you please admit you into a place of security and when fastened on the in  D Car  Aurora  I have too grateful a sense of your kindness to avail myself of a retreat which must expose you In this emergency the best way is to return to the place from whence I came  Musk  That's my advice Sir let us go to the inn directly take our mules and set offLadies my master and I have the honour of wishing you all health and happiness  Aur  Oh hold Don  Carlos  you must not goYou have by

 D Car  Don't be alarm'd we have arms to desend ourselves  Musk  No no ladies don't be alarmed We have arms to defend ourselves  Aur  Talk not of defence I beseech you but in pity to me go into the place I have shewn you and we will consult together for your better and safer accommodation  Musk  What the lady says Sir is just and reasonableI have considered the matter and if  you don't do it I'll give myself up to justice immediately and try to be admitted king's evidence  D Car  I'll do any thing for your safety  Leon  Here here get you in The closet's on the left hand where you'll find

a place of safety a coach is at the door and I will see you and your maid safely lodged in the Ursuline nunnery  Aur  Sir  D Ped  I have told you that my safety requires I should absent myself and I

gentleman called Don  Pedro  my people understand these are his lodgings he has wounded a gentleman in the street  Oct  Don  Pedro  st Off  Ay ay you know him well enough  Oct  I knew a sister of his who had these lodgings but she has been gone from them some time  st Off  to his people  Well have you found any one  d Off  No they have been too cunning for us  Oct  Upon my credit that Don  Pedro  you look for is not here he has been in Italy these three quarters of a year Please to accept a couple of doubloons You must certainly have been imposed upon  Gives money  st Off  To be sure as you say the gentleman is not here we'll take your word I see he is not here Come along comrades  Exeunt Officers  Oct  Let me lock this door before I go out  Enter  Don GUZMAN  D Guz  Octavio  your servant alas  Oct  I find then Sir your nephew has told me all  D Guz  I am come to talk to you about these lodgings I suppose you would let this tenement a  bargain to any one that would take it off your hands  Oct  To be sure Sir on an occasion like this  D Guz  Well if twenty dollars a month will be sufficient I will e'en hire the premises for my own use and take possession directly  Oct  Surely Sir twenty dollars are too little  D Guz  Well but consider it's doing the young man a favor for seeing my family in the house would prevent further enquiries and satisfy the police that  Don Pedro    Oct  I really think Sir that as your chief motive for taking the apartment is to serve Don  Pedro  the sooner you and your family come into it the better  D Guz  I am of that opinion too and as very luckily my time is just up where I now lodge and I want some larger rooms in consequence of my daughter's marriage which I shall shortly celebrate I shall send to you for the key within this half hour  Oct  You will oblige me Don  Guzman  by charging yourself with the key now for having a small vineyard near town I have shut up my apartments below and sent all my servants men and women to work there  D Guz  And you want to go yourself is it not so Well well go your ways and mind your business I'll take the key from you  Exeunt  Don  CARLOS  and  MUSKATO  come from behind the pannel  Musk  They are gone out again and have locked the door upon us  D Car  Did you hear all that has passed  Muskato  Musk  Yes Sir every word of it but don't grow desperate things are not so bad as we expected this is a respite at least if not a reprieve  D Car  A respite Has not Don  Guzman  taken this house over my head and am I not by that means in the hands of my most cruel and avowed enemy  Musk  Yes Sir but he does not know you are in his hands  D Car  The worst on't is that the merchant below is gone out with his family and has lock'd up the doors so that our retreat is stopped By forcing the lock of the door we may get out before our enemy returns I know the danger of shewing myself at this hour but  Musk  Oh Sir nothing is so dangerous as staying here if we can get out so pray let us force the door I have broke a lock before now upon a less justifiable occasion and I'll do my endeavour to master this  goes to the door and returns in a fright  Quick Sir quick back to our hiding place  D Car  What's the matter  Musk  Don  Guzman  's people are in the house come here and hide yourself and ask no questions  They get behind the pannel  Enter  BEATRICE  and  LAZARILLO  Beat  And so these are the lodgings we are in such a hurry to leave our old ones for  Laz  Ay how do you like them  Beat  Like them not at all In the first place that door has not common sense in it then the stairs are the wrong way and the windows mercy on us what pigeonholes and a mile and a half from the ground  Laz  Ay there's the fault you want to be gaping and staring into the street  Beat  Lazarillo  run to the old gentleman and tell him if he has not already signed the agreement  he must by no means take this houseI hear a each sure it is not my lady already  Laz  But it is though you had better tell her you don't like the house  Beat  So I shall I promise you  Enter  MARCELLA  La Ma'am you are in great haste I did not expect to see you these three hours  Mar  I set out to oblige my father nothing would satisfy him but I must come directly to see the apartments  Beat  If the kennel was mine I should think of nothing but pulling it down and selling the rubbish to the best bidder Take a ready furnish'd house indeed  Laz  Mrs Beatrice is difficult to please Ma'am  Mar  So she is indeedmy father tells me Lazarillo that it is to please your master he takes these lodgings and I suppose it is by his desire that we come to them so suddenly Do you know the reason of Don  Ferdinand  's extraordinary attachment  Laz  Why Ma'am I am generally pretty well acquainted with my master's secrets  Mar  I beg your pardon I did not know it was any secret or I should not have asked  Laz  Oh Ma'am there's no secret that is to say no absolute secret but as far as this here Ma'am the air and situation I believe  Beat  In short Ma'am Signor  Lazarillo  is a person who seldom chuses to seem ignorant of any thing Did your master ever tell you why he liked these longings  Laz  I can't say he ever did  Beat  Look you there Ma'am  Laz  Well Mrs  Beatrice  I did not speak to you  Mar  Never mind her  Lazarillo  but go and take care of these things I brought in the coach  Exit  Lazarillo  Mar  Ah Beatrice  Beat  Ay Ma'am here I am  Mar  I feel myself very unhappy  Beat  O fye Ma'am to tell me so on the eve of your marriage as it were  Mar  'Tis the thought of that makes me melancholy  Beat  Is it indeed I'm sure then Ma'am you and I are of very different dispositionsI wish I was going to be married the deuce a thing should I think of but that would make me very glad  Mar  How Beatrice suppose you were going to set out upon a journey which presented you with the most beautiful prospect but on the first advances you made you found yourself on the brink of a precipice what would you do  Beat  A very great precipice do you mean or only a little sort of a declivity  Mar  Pshaw I'm not in a jesting humour  Beat  Well but Ma'am let me understand youYou ask me if I was going to set out on a journey which presented me with the most beautiful prospect and on the first advances I made I found myself on the brink of a precipicewhat I would do  Mar  Ay  Beat  Why then Ma'am I'll tell youIn case it was not a very ugly precipice indeed I would muster up all my strengthshut my eyes soand give a great jump  Mar  In short Beatrice my cousin Don  Ferdinand    Beat  siopping her mistress  He's here Ma'am  Enter  DON FERDINAND  D Fer  How happy am I to arrive at a moment when you pronounce my name  Mar  I had just begun to talk to Beatrice when your coming into the room interrupted meI will take up the discourse again if you please and finish what I was going to say to her  D Fer  I am content  Beat  Stand there then Sir and we'll proceed in our discourse as if you were fifty miles offCome Ma'am begin  Mar  I say then  Beatrice  my cousin Don  Ferdinand  no doubt imagines that marriage is a dispensation from the trifling duties exacted by complaisance since he already begins to fail in those marks of tenderness and regard I expected to find from himhe forgets that love is nourished by attention and that the slightest negligence kills it  D Fer  Ah dear  Marcella  did you know how uneasy you make me by this kind of discourse  Mar  And why uneasywhat I spoke was said to  Beatrice  and you need take no notice of it as you need not be supposed to overhear  Beat  That's right Ma'amand to let you know another thing Sir you are not to take the words out of my mouthmy lady spoke to me and it's my part to answerand here's the way I do itI suppose Ma'am Don  Ferdinand  is like the rest of his sex who for the most part follow women as they hunt hares and foxes when the animal's catched the sport is overI once had a sweetheart myself Ma'am that used to call me his queen and his Venus and his AdonisTo be sure I used him very ill then he used to be so melancholy so pathetical so poetical I remember his once repeating to me these very moving lines  When first I attempted your pity to move  Why seem'd you so deaf to my prayers  Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love  But why did you kick me down stairs  Were they not Ma'am very moving oh dearCome Ma'am he looks penitent give him your hand to kiss and tell him you are friends with himLook you there Sir I knew itThere's nothing does with us like a little coaxing  D Fer  Your father my dear  Marcella  is determined to have our wedding a publick one and Saturday next he assures me shall be the happy day Just as I left home a good many of your things were brought which I have ordered to be sent here with some boxes of rich wine and foreign sweetmeats for the ball I intended to give a select number of our friends tomorrow night In the mean time I'll step back to the old lodging to see things properly taken care of  Lazarillo  bring up those parcels And you Mrs  Beatrice  will not find yourself forgotten  Exit  Beat  O then there's something for me  Lazarillo  make haste up with the thingsIsuppose it's the new gown he promised to give me and that your mantuamaker took measure of me for I long to see it  Lazarillo  I say will you be all day  Laz  without  Coming Mrs  Beatrice  coming  Beat  Why don't you make haste then  Laz  without  It's impossible to make haste enough for impatient people  He enters followed by other servants with boxes a case of wine c  Beat  Have not you something that your master gave you for me pray  Laz  I have something for every bodybut that's your bundle I believe  slings down a parcel which she immediately opens  Here comrades set the table yonder that I may put these things on it quick quick  Beat  Dear Madam look here upon my life it's very pretty and every thing complete a veil and a petticoat and lined all thro' with silk I have a good mind to try it on nowDo you think it will become me Ma'am  Laz  Your head runs upon nothing but your dress give me the key that I may see the condition of the other rooms  Exit  Laz  We are going back for more things Mrs  Beatrice  you'll please to take care of what we leave behind  Exeunt Lazarillo and servants  Beat  Ay ay I'll lock the door Well I swear and vow it's one of the genteelest things I ever saw in my lifeI wish however there had been a little more puffing upon the sleeves  Exit  Enter  Don CARLOS  and  MUSKATO  Musk  Speaking as he pushes back the pannel  I will go out  D Car  Muskato  Musk  Zounds Sir don't tell me as good be hang'd as famished  Perceiving the table that has been put against the pannel which prevents his coming forward  Heyday what have we hereThey have raised a buttress against our wooden wall  Puting his hand among the things on the table throws some of them down  D Car  What are you doing  Musk  Making a noiseHow shall I remove these impediments  Attempting to push the table from him overturns it  Oh Lord oh Lord  D Car  Death and hell are you bent on our ruin  Musk  For Heaven's sake Sir don't swear  Coming out  Damn

she gave him a good stomach  D Car  Muskato  let us think of our situation what shall we do shall we force our way out of the house at all events whatever  Musk  Why Sir if your friends and family could be apprised of your situation and design but as the matter stands Sir I don't think we shall be able to make our escape by violence  D Car  We can't pick our way through the walls then  Musk  No Sir I think it much better picking hereSuppose I take upon me a disguise make my escape inform your friends where you are and have 'em ready  D Car  What disguise  Musk  You see that gown there and the veil and things along with it I'll dress myself  alademoiselle  watch my opportunity when it is dark and I warrant get clear without any suspicion  D Car  'Sdeath here is somebody coming  Musk  Is

about screams  Ahh  Mar  How now  Beat  My new gown Ma'am where's my new gown that I left here when we went out did not you see me spread it on the chair with the other things  Mar  I thought so  Beat

Guz  And who is to answer for all this pretty work I would be glad to know did you think your frippery was stuff'd into the boxes and winecases that you have broke them to pieces  Beat  It was not I  D Guz  Who then  Beat  Old Nick I believe  Mar  Upon my word Sir it is something very extraordinaryWe left the things here in good order a little while ago and this moment that we came into the room

folks were to be married  Beat  If you want to know it's a question you ought to ask them  Laz  I must saith for it will be necessary for me to get my things and look a little about me  Beat  What and so you don't intend to stay with Don  Ferdinand  Laz  O damn it no it would not do for me at all Service with a single gentleman well and good but married families are hell and the devil  Beat  Do you intend to list for a soldier then or what 'Tis dangerous being out of place I have known several of your fraternity come to an untimely end by it  Laz  To tell you the truth I am afraid to stay with Don  Ferdinand  left as valets are apt to ape their masters I should be tempted to imitate him and as he had married your mistress the devil might put it into my head to marry you  Beat  surveying him with an air of contempt  What is the matter with this glass It always makes me look browner than any other in the house  Affecting  a minuet step  We shall have a ball here tomorrow evening I suppose

Medina's  and I find his wounds are not so bad as I at first apprehended The report however of Don  Pedro  being the person who assaulted him rather gains ground  D Guz  Like enough  D Fer  Nay some officers have as I understand been seen within these two hours walking backwards and forwards before this house and looking at it very inquisitively  D Guz  Then belike they still suspect that Don  Pedro  is in it  D Fer  So it should seem  D Guz  And we may have a visit from them in the night perhaps when we least desire their company I'll strive to prevent them Come hither you Sir Go to the Conde de  Lemos  governor of Madrid his palace is hard by give my respects  and tell his excellency I shall be much obliged to him if he will order me directly a couple of centinels to stand at my door Tell him I shall want them for two or three days till I have married my daughter  Exit Lazarillo  D Fer  I have not seen Don  Pedro  since yesterday Sir and as he has given me an intimation where

the idea of making the best room in your house a bedchamber  D Guz  Because I like it  Beat  Why Sir it will be shocking  D Guz  What's that to you  Beat  Besides I suppose Don  Ferdinand  will remove to my lady's chamber in a night or two  D Guz  Ha now you have got that in your head and who bid you suppose about it  Beat  Nay Sir it's no business of mine to be sure if you have a mind to turn the house upside down  only I love to set people right and see things done properly  D Guz  Well but my nephew chose that room particularly  Laz  Why so I told Mrs  Beatrice  Sir I said my master had made particular choice of that room  Beat  Very well then let his bed be put in it but remember Sir it's done by no order of mine  D Guz  I believe there never was your fellow for impertinence since the world begun But why should I be surprized at this when I am told you give out all over the neighbourhood that I am going to marry you  Laz  Ha ha ha  D Guz  Ay you may well laugh  Beat  I never gave out any such thing  D Guz  Don't lie for I can prove it upon you  Beat  I say then Sir I never did for the thing was first mentioned to me and isn't it common enough when a genteel likely girl lives in the house with a gentleman for people to talk  D Guz  Well I shan't dispute the matter with you now Go take the coach and fetch your young lady home she's at her aunt's Why don't you go where I bid you  Beat  I'm settling myself Sir  Laz  Ha ha ha marry  Beat  What's the matter with you I promise you I don't know whether I would take the old fellow if he would have me so he need not make himself uneasy  Exeunt  Lazarillo  and  Beatrice  D Guz  A paltry dirty baggage to give out that I was going to marry her there never was such a thought entered into my head  Enter  AURORA  veiled  Heyday who have we here who is it that comes into the house this way without knocking Is there nobody in the way to shew people  Aur  Don't be offended Signor at the liberty an unfortunate woman has taken upon seeing your door open I implore a moment's refuge  D Guz  Explain yourself  Aur  I have the misfortune to be the wife of the most jealous and suspicious of mankind who is at the same time the most cruel Upon a person's looking after me in the street just now he took something into his head drew his poinard and was going to strike me  D Guz  O for shame What can I do for you  Aur  I intreat you to go down into the street and speak to him not to misuse me you will easily know him he is in a red cloak and wears a gold laced hat with a black feather  D Guz  I'll go down madam Step into that chamber no body shall molest you I warrant I'll give a good account of your jealous pate and if words won't do rougher means shall  Don  Guzman  puts  Aurora  into a room then goes out on the opposite side Don  Carlos  pushes back the pannel and comes out with  Muskato  who is disguised in woman's cloaths  D Car  Muskato  it is now quite dark and you may if ever escape with out being seen as for myself I'll wait with patience determined to brave every thing till your return  Musk  I don't know what's the matter with me Sir I am damnably frightened  D Car  As soon as you have brought my friends together in the street the signal is to be a pistol  when I hear it I will instantly rush out and force my passage to you  Musk  Ay Sir but the grand matter is my getting out  D Car  Farewell at any rate don't let your apprehensions confound you  Exit Don  Carlos  through the Pannel  Enter  AURORA  Aur  Don  Guzman  's gone and all is dark this is the moment to find Don  Carlos  Assist me

digestive naps after dinner I only wait their arrival to give Don  Carlos  the signal from this little popper  shews a pistol  but I must first take a view of the house in order to determine on which

men and women being concealed in the house  D Fer  'Tis most certain Sir that I met a strange man in the house last night but I don't pretend to determine how he got in  D Guz  My daughter says there was a strange woman and for any thing that appears to the contrary both the lurking toads may be in the house still and if somebody does not ferret them out we may have our throats cut one of these nights when we are asleep in our beds and dreaming of no such matter  D Fer  Oh Sir I can't think they are in the house still  D Guz  Oh but I'll be sure and therefore I am determined to hunt every
