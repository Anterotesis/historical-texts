 Capt Dampier's Vindication of his Voyage  To the  SouthSeas  in the Ship St  George  With some small Obse  ations for the  on Mr  F    el  's Chime  ical  Of the Voyage Roun  the World  and Det  ed in Little until he shall be Examin'd more at Large  IN the first place he calls himself my Mate He went out my Steward and afterwards I did ma  e a Mi  hipman of him Indeed he had the Advan  age of perusing Draughts and Books of which he afterwards  a slender Account for some he pre  ended were lost and others the Draug  are torn  of th  Especially the Draughts of Winds which I grea  ly suspect him of Doing because he is not the first Man that has Endeavour'd to build upon another Man's Foundation  In pag lin he says that Cap    Pullen  was going in Comp  ny with us but while we lay at Anchor in the  Downs  there arose a Differe  ce between to  wo Captains on which  Pullen  went away  I wonder at his Impudence for I was at  London  when Cap    Pullen  ent away and  was the Owner's His and Mine could not agree▪ to whom I Appeal  In p Our P  posals says he were to go into the  River of Plate  and to  Air  s  to take or  Spanish  Galleons wh  ch Cap  gives an  A  co  nt of  I say Capt  Dampier  as he does  Gentleman that  not to return Home  there  I des  re to kn  w of th  Gentleman when it was tha  gave this Accou  a  d to  I must confess there was some Discourse about it but I never desig  o go to  Buonas Aires  for  em being such a Dangerous River  Ʋp And I think Capt  Pullen  something  from thence may conclude that be plea  ▪ For  ▪  He giv  Reasons of his  we did not go to  Buonas Aires  produce Reasons  Where Mr  Funn  says C  pt  Dampier  and Lie  t  Huzford  ▪  T  ere  Mr  Morg  n  Purser and Agent that disagreed with  Huzford▪  went ashore▪ and Fought upon  Corri  idor  Co  fu'  Mr  H  xford  nd a  he himself sent f  r  Ch  t and Cloaths which  I  ay b  fore  I  ent for him Aboard and  actually came  I had no  of  but Mr  Morgan  swore if Mr  Huxford  sau'd  not go the Voyage  And where ill Blood  upon which I ordered h  m to go on Boa  d Capt    whose Boat was on  along our  ide an  after a Gen  leman  manner  but it happen'd  carrying  to th  He and  xford  disagreeing  th  y were goi  g fro  he  him on Boa  d a  Portugueze  Mar  han  Man  In relation to  J  mes Ba  by  second Lie  t He say  s that  and eight of the Men went on shore and left us taking their Chests and Cloaths with them  To the  I take God to witness I never  but I r  fus'd them  nothing like the for  mer Design This Mr  Morgan  can    In p  Mr▪  Fa  nel    to settle my Mistakes says he saw    But every body know  it is a Greater    The' th  re may be more  that we pass over to abrevi  te this Matter as yet my Crew not being wholly  ere I m  ion o  the two Action  of the Voyage    The first of which is the  Engag'd that was cr  sing to the Island of  an Fernando's  to  hom we gave Chace from    in the Afternoon and  making of her  I found she was an  E  opean  Ship and not a  Spaniard  not willing to pursue  farther but the  Right or Wrong  follow'd her and next  we came up  her and when I saw no  hing would  Attempt I  encourag'd them  By this time my Consort  given her a  Broad side  up  and gave her a  Broadside  likewise  were then  they Fir'd upon our  his  his Help Notwithstanding  and Exchang'd or  Broadsides  suffer'd    kill'd and  wound  d which  much they a  tually run down off the  Deck  and made nothing of it afterwards So that when  I  could have boarded her and carried her the Mate  Cleppington  by Name  The Men ar  all gone and  Bel  ha  h  the Master whose Offic  it was  upon  Deck  also th  this    In p Mr  Funnell  says the Crew were Desirous to  this Ship  they made nothing of i  while in  Power What was to be done afterwards And as to my telling  as he says  I could  et at a  y time  l  I  say so  I  my  Boats  which were then  my P  ople have been Rul'd  In p Mr  Funnell  says we took a Ship of Tuns loaden  several good Commodities as  Indigo Cochineel  c  Now for  Cochineel  I never heard of any  Indigo  there was  the other and the  Turtlesh  l  he so frequently speaks of  be go  the same w  y th  many Rich and Valuable Goods  have by the Management of those Pyrating Fellows rather  Sailors the  Indigo  I could not take on Board nor could I trust any of them with the Sailing such a Ship as could neither keep me Company nor mak a right Steerageway  In p He says truth as to Mr  Observator's  Ship and the  Monkey  that was left in her  but as to Firing at any thing but the Ship  and the whole Crew who before we could make up to her had made into their Boats and nothing beside  the Cargo and the  Monkey  were indeed on Board  which  along had we not Observators enough at Home  The next thing they Charge me with especi  lly Mr▪  F  nn  ll  in p in the  of St  Michael  were in the Barque last taken and Indian C  noe  and that I order'd her to be Fir'd upon  The  for when I saw some of them that had F  r'd without my Orders I wa  very Ʋneasy and Troubled at it knowing the Consequence of it  T  e Second Thing that  's  Material is▪  that the Ship mentioned by Mr  Funnel  in p where he seems to  Dollars was Hid in the Run of the Ship  and I slipt the  of taking it and  her Adrift  So this I answer  That  I had evident Proof had Landed her Money at Truxille and as to Provisions we took as much as would provide us for One Year and much longer if well manag'd that was what our Ship could well  and this was the  Steward  and the  Crew  's Calculation Now as to a Report that they make about Town  Dollars that  Ransom First I had no convenient Road to Ride in and the strong  Southerly Winds  were set in and so if I had Loyter'd for her must certainly been Imbay'd for or Months Besides the  Winds  thro' the Treachery of the  Spaniards  I have had the Experience of it be+fore in a like Case Riding  for Ransom with Capt  Swa  and Capt    for instead of keeping their Faith they  off with a  the Night and  Pe  agoes  and  better Crew and  Men We came narrowly of  Now th  they are Judges in my Case and Conduct a  who were perpetually drunk and very tit you'll say  the Night or being kept in any Decorum  p Whereas Mr  Funnell  frequently w  uld Insinuate that I could agree with no body and so says that parted this way with Capt  Stradling  I say I  Stradling  nay not only that but at  Juan de Fernandos  whe  all hi  Men left him I reconcil'd them and him again therefor      The next Morning  who is a very Valia  t Man    with  Men and  ireArms with them  What's observable is it's not enough to Run away with  do what you please with  of Si  k  or any other  and that I r  fer my self to all Sailors in the World wh  er it was right or not A  c  sidering the
