 tableau  La Vergne del M V  ar  Gucht sc  THE WONDER A Woman keeps a SECRET A COMEDY As it is Acted at the  Theatre Royal in DruryLane  By Her MAJESTY's Servants  Written by the AUTHOR of the GAMESTER  LONDON  Printed for E CURLL at the  Dial  and  Bible  against St  Dunstan  's Church in  Fleetstreet  and A BETTESWORTH at the  Red Lyon  on  LondonBridge    TO His Serene HIGHNESS  George Augustus  Electoral Prince of HANOVER Duke and Marquess of  Cambridge  Earl of  MilfordHaven  Viscount  NorthAllerton  Baron of  Tewksbury  and Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter  May it please your  Highness  _THIS Dedication which I always intended to Address to your  HIGHNESS  and which  I was in hopes might have Congratulated you upon your being in  England  must now wait for your Arrival I am sure I speak the Sense of every honest  Briton  when I say that we expect it with the utmost Impatience  Your Highness who has been hitherto a Stranger among us cannot easily conceive the Confidence we repose in you and it will perhaps hardly be believ'd in future Ages that the first Report of the Duke  of  Cambridge  's Design to Visit us should raise the  PUBLICK CREDIT  of the  British Nation    We are fill'd with Pleasure to think that the most accomplish'd of  Princes  will perfect himself in the Arts of Government under the Eye and Direction of the Greatest of  Queens    If it is possible there shou'd be a Sett of Men among us who can wish to see their Country become a Province of  France  it is I think pretty evident that  your Residence in  GreatBritain  will soon put an End to such Impious Expectations  The Law of Nature makes it not improbable that you will one Day reign over us and what may not our Posterity expect from a Prince who in his early Years distinguish'd himself in the Cause of Liberty and led their Ancestors on to Victory The Balance of  Europe  will doubtless be kept steady by that Hand which has already perform'd  such Wonders in order to maintain it our Religion our Laws and Civil Rites can be in no Danger under a Prince who from his Conversation with our Nobility and his Presence at their most important Debates will have a perfect Insight into all the Parts of our Constitution  Britain  shall from henceforward claim your  HIGHNESS  intirely as her own and endeavour by the most convincing Proofs of her Love and Respect to make you  forget the Court of your Illustrious Father  The Pains you have already taken to acquire our Tongue cannot fail to endear you to every  Englishman  yet as the Idioms of a Language are the last Things we arrive at I am in hopes an  English  Comedy will not be thought the most improper Present that could be offer'd to your  HIGHNESS    There is no doubt but you will soon be made the Subject of more Correct Pens and receive a just Tribute  from the greatest Authors of our Nation In the mean Time tho' I am perhaps the most unworthy I have at least one Advantage that I am the first who have shewn my Respect in this Manner and sued for your Protection  I am your HIGHNESS's Most Obedient Most Devoted Most Humble Servant SUSANNA CENT LIVRE  PREFACE  I Don't pretend to write a Preface either to point out the Beauties or to excuse the Errors a judicious Reader may possibly discover in the following Scenes but to give those excellent Comedians their Due to whom in some Measure the best Dramatick Writers are oblig'd The Poet and the Player are like Soul and Body indispensibly necessary to one another the correct Author makes the Player shine whilst the judicious Player makes the Poet's Fame immortal I freely acknowledge my self oblig'd to the Actors in general and to Mr  Wilks  and Mrs  Oldfield  in particular and I owe them this Justice to say That their inimitable Action cou'd only support a Play at such a Season and among so many Benefits Let this encourage our  English  Bards to Write furnish but the artful Player with Materials and his Skill will lay the Foundation for your Fame  I must again repeat that which I meet with every where I mean the just Admiration of the Performance of Mr  Wilks  and Mrs  Oldfield  and own that they much outdid in Action the strongest of my Conceptions for tho' Nature was my Aim in the last Act of this Comedy yet Nature herself were she to paint a Love Quarrel wou'd only Copy them  PROLOGUE  Spoken by  Mr  MILLS  OUR  Author  fears the Criticks of the Stage  Who like Barbarians spare nor Sex nor Age  She trembles at those Censors in the Pit  Who think good Nature shows a want of Wit  Such Malice Oh what Muse can undergo it  To save themselves they always Damn the Poet  Our Author flies from such a Partial Jury  As wary Lovers from the Nymphs of  Drury  To the few Candid Judges for a Smile  She humbly sues to Recompence her Toil  To the bright Circle of the Fair she next  Commits her Cause with Anxious Doubts perplext  Where can she with such hopes of Favour kneel  As to those Judges who her Frailties feel  A few Mistakes her Sex may well excuse  And such a Plea No  Woman  shou'd refuse  If she succeeds a  Woman  gains Applause  What  Female  but must favour such a Cause  Her FaultsIf such there beThenpass 'em by  And only on her Beauties fix your Eye  In Plays like Vessels floating on the Sea  There's none so Wise to know their Destiny  In this howe'er the Pilot's Skill appears  While by the Stars his constant Course he steers  In this our  Author  does her Judgment shew  That for her Safety she relies on You  Your Approbation Fair ones can't but move  Those stubborn Hearts which first you taught to Love  The Men must all Applaud this Play of ours  For who dares See with other Eyes than Yours  Dramatis Personae  Men  Don Lopez  a Grandee of  Portugal  Mr  Norris  Don

 FREDERICK  _MY Lord  Don Lopez    D Lop  How do you  Frederick  Fred  At your Lordship's Service I am glad to see you look so well my Lord I hope  Antonio  is out of danger  D Lop  Quite contrary his Feaver increases they tell me and the Surgeons are of Opinion his wound is mortal  Fred  Your Son  Don Felix  is safe I hope  D Lop  I hope so too but they offer large Rewards to apprehend him  Fred  When heard your Lordship from him  D Lop  Not since he went I forbad him writing till the publick News gave him an Account of  Antonio  's Health Letters might be intercepted and the place of his Abode discovered  Fred  Your Caution was good my Lord tho' I am impatient to hear from  Felix  yet his Safety is my chief Concern Fortune has maliciously struck a Bar between us in the Affairs of Life but she has done me the Honour to unite our Souls  D Lop  I am not ignorant of the friendship between my Son and You I have heard him commend your Morals and lament your want of noble Birth  Fred  That's Nature's fault my Lord 'tis some comfort not to owe ones Misfortunes to ones Self yet 'tis impossible not to regret the want of noble Birth  D Lop  'Tis pity indeed such excellent Parts as you are Master of should be eclipsed by mean Extraction  Fred  Such Commendation wou'd make me vain my Lord did you not cast in the allay of my Extraction  D Lop  There is no Condition of Life without its Cares and it is the Perfection of a Man to wear 'em as easie as he can this unfortunate Duel of my Son's does not pass without Impression But since 'tis past Prevention all my Concern is now how he may escape the Punishment if  Antonio  dies  Felix  shall for  England  You have been there what sort of People are the  English  Fred  My Lord the  English  are by Nature what the ancient  Romans  were by Discipline couragious bold hardy and in love with Liberty Liberty is the Idol of the  English  under whose Banner all the Nation Lists give but the Word for Liberty and straight more armed Legions wou'd appear than  France  and  Philip  keep in constant Pay  D Lop  I like their Principles who does not wish for Freedom in all Degrees of Life Tho' common Prudence sometimes makes us act against it as I am now obliged to do for I intend to marry my Daughter to  Don Guzman  whom I expect from  Holland  every Day whither he went to take Possession of a large Estate left him by his Uncle  Fred  You will not sure Sacrifice the lovely  Isabella  to Age Avarice and a Fool pardon the Expression my Lord but my Concern for your beauteous Daughter transports me beyond that good Manners which I ought to pay your Lordship's presence  D Lop  I can't deny the justness of the Character  Frederick  but you are not insensible what I have suffered by these Wars and he has two things which render him very agreeable to me for a SoninLaw he is Rich and well Born as for his being a Fool I don't conceive how that can be any Blot in a Husband who is already possess'd of a good EstateA Poor Fool indeed is a very Scandalous thing and so are your Poor Wits in my Opinion who have nothing to be vain of but the inside of their Sculls now for  Don Guzman  I know I can rule him as I think fit this is acting the Politick part  Frederick  without which it is impossible to keep up the Port of this Life  Fred  But have you no Consideration for your Daughter's welfare my Lord  D Lop  Is a Husband of twenty thousand Crowns a Year no Consideration Now I think it a very good Consideration  Fred  One way my Lord But what will the World say of such a Match  D Lop  Sir I value not the World a Button  Fred  I cannot think your Daughter can have any Inclination for such a Husband  D Lop  There I believe you are pretty much in the right tho' it is a Secret which I never had the Curiosity  to enquire into nor I believe ever shallInclination quotha Parents would have a fine time on't if they consulted their Childrens Inclinations I'll venture you a Wager that in all the Garrison Towns in  Spain  and  Portugal  during the late War there were not three Women who have not had an Inclination to every Officer in the whole Army does it therefore follow that their Fathers ought to Pimp for them No no Sir it is not a Father's business to follow his Childrens Inclinations till he makes himself a Beggar  Fred  But this is of another Nature my Lord  D Lop  Look ye Sir I resolve she shall Marry  Don Guzman  the Moment he arrives tho' I cou'd not govern my Son I will my Daughter I assure you  Fred  This Match my Lord is more preposterous than that which you proposed to your Son from whence arose this fatalQuarrel  Don Antonio  's Sister  Elvira  wanted Beauty only but  Guzman  every thing but  D Lop  Moneyand that will purchase every thing and so Adieu    Exit  Fred  Monstrous These are the Resolutions which destroy the comforts of Matrimonyhe is Rich and well born powerful Arguments indeed Could I but add them to the Friendship of  Don Felix  what might I not hope But a Merchant and a Grandee of  Spain  are inconsistent Names  Lissardo  From whence come you  Enter  Lissardo  in a Riding Habit    Liss  That Letter will inform you Sir  Fred  I hope your Master's safe  Liss  I left him so I have another to deliver which requireshasteYour most humble Servant Sir    bowing  Fred  To  Violante  I suppose  Liss  The same    Exit  Fred    Reads    Dear  Frederick  the two chief Blessings of this Life are a Friend and a Mistress to be debarred the sight of those is not to live I hear nothing of  Antonio  's Death therefore resolve to venture to thy House this Evening impatient to see  Violante  and embrace my Friend Yours  Felix  Pray Heaven he comes undiscover'dha Colonel  Britton    Enter Colonel  Britton  in a Riding Habit    Col  Frederick  I rejoice to see thee  Fred  What brought you to  Lisbon  Colonel  Col  La Fortune de la Guerre  as the  French  say I have commanded these Three last Years in  Spain  but my Country has thought fit to strike up a Peace and give us good  Protestants  leave to hope for Christian Burial so I resolve to take  Lisbon  in my way home  Fred  If you are not provided of a Lodging Colonel pray command my House while you stay  Col  If I were sure I should not be troublesome I wou'd accept your offer  Frederick    Fred  So far from trouble Colonel I shall take it as a particular Favour what have we here  Col  My Footman this is our Country Dress you must know which for the Honour of  Scotland  I make all my Servants wear    Enter  Gibby  in a  Highland  Dress    Gib  What mun I de with the Horses an like yer Honour they will tack cold gin they stand in the Caussway  Fred  Oh I'll take Care of them what hoa  Vasquez      Enter  Vasquez  put those Horses which that honest Fellow will show you into my Stable do you hear And feed them well  Vas  Yes SirSir by my Master's Order I am Sir your most obsequious humble Servant Be pleas'd to lead the Way    bowing  Gib  S'bled gang yer gat Sir and I fall follow yee Ise tee hungry to feed on Compliments    Exit  Fred  Ha ha a comical FellowWell how do you like our Country Colonel  Col  Why Faith  Frederick  a Man might pass his Time agreeably enough with Inside of a Nunnery but to behold such Troops of soft plump tender melting wishing nay willing Girls too thro' a damn'd Grate gives us  Brittons  strong Temptation to Plunder Ah  Frederick  your Priests are wicked Rogues They immure Beauty for their own proper Use and show it only to the Laity to create Desires and inflame Accompts that they may purchase Pardons at a dearer Rate  Fred  I own Wenching is something more difficult here than in  England  where Womens Liberties are subservient to their Inclinations and Husbands seem of no Effect but to take Care of the Children which their Wives provide  Col  And does Restraint get the better of Inclination with your Women here No I'll be sworn not even in fourscore Don't I know the Constitution of the  Spanish  Ladies  Fred  And of all Ladies where you come Colonel you were ever a Man of Gallantry  Col  Ah  Frederick  the  Kirk  half starves us  Scotchmen  We are kept so sharp at home that we feed like Cannibals abroad Hark ye hast thou never a pretty Acquaintance now that thou wouldst consign over to a Friend for half an Hour ha  Fred  Faith Colonel I am the worst Pimp in  Christendom  you had better trust to your own Luck the Women will soon find you out I warrant you  Col  Ay but it is dangerous forraging in an Enemy's Country and since I have some hopes of seeing  my own again I had rather purchase my Pleasure than run the hazard of a  Stilletto  in my Guts 'Egad I think I must e'en Marry and Sacrifice my Body for the good of my Soul wilt thou recommend me to a Wife then one that is willing to exchange her  Moyders  for  English  Liberty ha Friend  Fred  She must be very handsome I suppose  Col  The handsomer the betterbut be sure she has a Nose  Fred  Ay ay and some Gold  Col  Oh very much Gold I shall never be able to swallow the Matrimonial Pill if it be not well Gilded  Fred  Puh Beauty will make it slide down nimbly  Col  At first perhaps it may but the Second or Third Dose will choak meI confess  Frederick  Women are the prettiest Playthings in Nature but Gold substantial Gold gives 'em the Air the Mien the Shape the Grace and Beauty of a Goddess  Fred  And has not Gold the same Divinity in their Eyes Colonel  Col  Too oftenMoney is the very God of Marriage the Poets dress him in a Saffron Robe by which they Figure out the golden Deity and his lighted Torch blazons those mighty Charms which encourage us to List under his Banner  None marry now for Love no that's a Jest  The self same Bargain serves for Wife and Beast  Fred  You are always gay Colonel come shall we take a refreshing Glass at my House and consider what has been said  Col  I have two or three Compliments to discharge for some Friends and then I shall wait on you with Pleasure Where do you live  Fred  At yon Corner House with the green Rails  Col  In the close of the Evening I will endeavour to kiss your Hand Adieu    Exit  Fred  I shall expect you with impatience    Exit    Enter  Isabella  and  Inis  her Maid    Inis  For goodness sake Madam where are you going in this Pet  Isab  Any where to avoid Matrimony the thoughts of a Husband is as terrible to me as the sight of a Hobgoblin  Inis  Ay of an old Husband but if you might chuse for your self I fancy Matrimony wou'd be no such frightful Thing to you  Isab  You are pretty much in the right  Inis  but to be forc'd into the Arms of an Ideot a sneaking snivling drivling avaricious Fool who has neither Person to please the Eye Sense to charm the Ear nor generosity to supply those Defects ah  Inis  What pleasant Lives Women lead in  England  where Duty wears no Fetter but Inclination The Custom of our Country inslaves us from our very Cradles first to our Parents next to our Husbands and when Heaven is so kind to rid us of both these our Brothers still usurp Authority and expect a blind Obedience from us so that Maids Wives or Widows we are little better than Slaves to the Tyrant Man therefore to avoid their Power I resolve to cast my self into a Monastery  Inis  That is you'll cut your own Throat to avoid another's doing it for you Ah Madam those Eyes tell me you have no Nuns flesh about you a Monastery quotha Where you'll wish your self in the GreenSickness in a Month  Isab  What care I there will be no Man to plague me  Inis  No nor what's much worse to please you  neitherAd'slife Madam you are the First Woman that e'er dispair'd in a Christian CountryWere I in your Place  Isab  Why what wou'd your Wisdom do if you were  Inis  I'de imbark with the first fair Wind with all my Jewels and seek my Fortune on t'other side the Water no Shoar can treat you worse than your own there's ne'er a Father in  Christendom  should make me marry any Man against my Will  Isab  I am too great a Coward to follow your Advice I must contrive some way to avoid  Don Guzman  and yet stay in my own Country  Enter  Don Lopez  Lop  Must you so Mistress but I shall take Care to prevent you    Aside    Isabella  whether are you going my Child  Isab  Ha my Father To Church Sir  Inis  The old Rogue has certainly overheard her    Aside  Lop  Your Devotion must needs be very strong or your Memory very weak my Dear why Vespers are over for this Night come come you shall have a better Errand to Church than to say your Prayers there  Don Guzman  is arriv'd in the River and I expect him ashore to Morrow  Isab  Ha to Morrow  Lop  He writes me Word That his Estate in  Holland  is worth Crowns a Year which together with what he had before will make thee the happiest Wife in  Lisbon    Isab  And the most unhappy Woman in the World Oh Sir If I have any Power in your Heart if the tenderness of a Father be not quite extinct hear me with Patience  Lop  No Objections against the Marriage and I will hear whatever thou hast to say  Isab  That's torturing me on the Rack and forbidding me to Groan upon my Knees I claim the Priviledge of Flesh and Blood    Kneels  Lop  I grant it thou shalt have an Arm full of Flesh and Blood to Morrow Flesh and Blood quotha Heaven forbid I should deny thee Flesh and Blood my Girl  Inis  Here's an old Dog for you  Isab  Do not mistake Sir the fatal Stroak which separates Soul and Body is not more terrible to the Thoughts of Sinners than the Name of  Guzman  to my Ears  Lop  Puh puh you Lye you Lye  Isab  My frighted Heart beats hard against my Breast as if it sought a Passage to your Feet to beg you'd change your Purpose  Lop  A very pretty Speech this if it were turn'd into blank Verse it would serve for a  Tragedy  why thou hast more Wit than I thought thou hadst ChildI fancy this was all  extempore  I don't believe thou did'st ever think of one Word on't before  Inis  Yes but she has my Lord for I have heard her say the same Things a thousand Times  Lop  How how What do you top your second Hand Jests upon your Father Hussy who knows betther what's good for you than you do your self remember 'tis your Duty to Obey  Isab    Rising    I never disobey'd before and wish I had not Reason now but Nature has got the better of my Duty and makes me loath the harsh Commands you lay  Lop  Ha ha very fine Ha ha  Isab  Death it self wou'd be more welcome  Lop  Are you sure of that  Isab  I am your Daughter my Lord and can boast as strong a Resolution as your self I'll die before I'll marry  Guzman    Lop  Say you so I'll try that presently    Draws    Here let me see with what Dexterity you can breath a Vein now    offers her his Sword    The Point is pretty sharp 'twill do your Business I warrant you  Inis  Bless me Sir What do you mean to put a Sword into the Hands of a desperate Woman  Lop  Desperate ha ha ha you see how desperate she is what art thou frighted little  Bell  ha  Isab  I confess I am startled at your Morals Sir  Lop  Ay ay Child thou hadst better take the Man he'll hurt thee the least of the two  Isab  I shall take neither Sir Death has many Doors and when I can live no longer with Pleasure I shall find one to let him in at without your aid  Lop  Say'st thou so my dear  Bell  Ods I'm afraid thou art a little Lunatick  Bell  I must take Care of thee Child    takes hold of her and pulls out of his Pocket a Key    I shall make bold to secure thee my Dear I'll see if Locks and Bars can keep thee till  Guzman  comes go get you into your Chamber  There I'll your boasted Resolution try  And see who'll get the better you or I    pushes her in and locks the Door  ACT II  SCENE  a Room in  Don Pedro's  House  Enter  Donna Violante  reading a Letter and  Flora  following    Flora  WHAT must that Letter be read again  Vio  Yes and again and again

me  Fel  Nay no great Matter but my Man tells me that he has had some little Difference with a Servant of his that's all  Fred  He is a good harmless innocent Fellow I am  sorry for it the Colonel lodges in my House I knew him formerly in  England  and met him here by Accident last Night and gave him an Invitation home he is a Gentleman of a good Estate besides his Commission of excellent Principles and strict Honour I assure you  Fel  Is he a Man of Intrigue  Fred  Like other Men I suppose here he comes    Enter  Colonel  Colonel I began to think I had lost you  Col  And not without some Reasons if you knew all  Fel  There's no Danger of a fine Gentleman's being lost in this Town Sir  Col  That Compliment don't belong to me Sir But I assure you I have been very near being run away with  Fred  Who attempted it  Col  Faith I know her notOnly that she is a charming Woman I mean as much as I saw of her  Fel  My Heart swells with ApprehensionSome accidental Rencounter  Fred  A Tavern I suppose adjusted the Matter  Col  A Tavern No no Sir she is above that Rank I assure you this Nymph sleeps in a Velvet Bed and Lodgings every Way agreeable  Fel  Ha a Velvet BedI thought you said but now Sir you knew her not  Col  No more I don't Sir  Fel  How came you then so well acquainted with her Bed  Fred  Ay ay come come unfold  Col  Why then you must know Gentleman that I was convey'd to her Lodgings by one of Cupids Emissaries call'd a Chambermaid in a Chair thro' fifty blind Alleys who by the help of a Key let me into a Garden  Fel  S'Death a Garden this must be  Violante  's Garden    Aside  Col  From thence conducted me into a spacious Room then dropt me a Courtesie told me her Lady would wait on me presently so without unvailing modestly withdrew  Fel  Damn her Modesty this was  Flora      Aside  Fred  Well how then Colonel  Col  Then Sir immediately from another Door issued forth a Lady arm'd at both Eyes from whence such Showers of Darts fell round me that had I not been cover'd with the Shield of another Beauty I had infallibly fall'n a Martyr to her Charms for you must know I just saw her Eyes Eyes did I say No no hold I saw but one Eye tho' I suppose it had a Fellow equally as killing  Fel  But how came you to see her Bed Sir S'Death this Expectation gives a thousand Racks    Aside  Col  Why upon her Maid's giving Notice her Father was coming she thrust me into the BedChamber  Fel  Upon her Father's coming  Col  Ay so she said but putting my Ear to the Keyhole of the Door I found it was another Lover  Fel  Confound the Jilt 'Twas

decline this Business than pursue it This may be a Mistake however I'll give you my  Honour never to have any Affair directly or indirectly with  Violante  provided she is your  Violante  but if there shou'd happen to be another of her Name I hope you wou'd not engross all the  Violantes  in the Kingdom  Fel  Your Vanity has given me sufficient Reasons to believe I'm not mistaken I'm not to be

the Son of one of our Grandees nam'd  Don Lopez de Pementell  a very honest Gentleman but something passionate in what relates to his LoveHe  is an only Son which perhaps may be one Reason for indulging his Passion  Col  When Parents have but one Child they either make a Madman or a Fool of him  Fred  He is not the only Child he has a Sister but I think thro' the Severity of his Father who would have married her against her Inclination she has made her escape and notwithstanding he has offer'd five hundred Pounds he can get no Tydings of her  Col  Ha How long has she been missing  Fred  Nay but since last Night it seems  Col  Last Night The very Time How went she  Fred  No body can tell they conjecture thro' the Window  Col  I'm transported This must be the Lady I caught What sort of

Opinion  We'd soon shake off this false usurp'd Dominion  We'd make the Tyrants own that we cou'd prove  As fit for other Business as for Love  Lord What Prerogative might we obtain  Could we from Yielding a few Months refrain  How fondly wou'd our starving Lovers doat  What Homage wou'd be paid to Petticoat  'Twou'd be a Jest to see the change of Fate  How we might all of Politicks Debate  Promise and Swear what we ne'er meant to do  And what's still harder  keep your Secrets too    Ay Marry  Keep a Secret  says a Beau  And sneers at some illnatur'd Wit below  But Faith if we shou'd tell but half we know  There's many a spruce Young Fellow in this Place  Would never more presume to show his Face  Women  are not so weak whate'er  Men  prate  How many tip top Beau  's  have had the Fate  T'enjoy from  Mamma  's Secrets their Estate  Which if Her early Folly had made known  He'd rid behind the Coach that's now His own  But here the  Wond'rous Secret  you discover  A  Lady  ventures for a  Friend  a  Lover    Prodigious For my part I frankly own  I'd spoil'd the  Wonder  and the  Woman  shown  FINIS
