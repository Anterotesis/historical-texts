 AN ESSAY UPON LOANS OR AN ARGUMENT PROVING That Substantial FUNDS settled by Parliament with the Encouragement of  Interests  and the Advances of  Prompt Payment  usually allow'd will bring in Loans of Money to the  Exchequer  in spight of all the Conspiracies of Parties to the contrary while a Just Honourable and Punctual Performance on the part of the Government supports the Credit of the Nation  By the Author of the  Essay upon Credit  LONDON  Printed and Sold by the Booksellers MDCCX  ADVERTISEMENT  Lately Publish'd by the same Author  AN Essay upon  Publick Credit  Being an Enquiry how the  Publick Credit  comes to depend upon the Change of the  Ministry  or the Dissolution of  Parliaments  and whether it does fo or no  With an Argument Proving that the  Publick Credit  may be upheld and maintain'd in this Nation and perhaps brought to a greater Height than it ever yet arriv'd ae Tho' all the Changes or Dissolutions already Made Pretended to and now Discours'd of shou'd come to pass in the World Sold by the Booksellers  AN ESSAY UPON LOANS  HAVING Treated in brief upon the Difficult Subject of  Credit  and that if the Town is not a Deceiver with some Success it seems necessary to speak a Word or two upon the great Object upon which that Credit Operates  viz Loans of Money  upon the Publick Demands  The Author  an Enemy to long Prefaces  presents his Thoughts to the World upon this Head without any other Apology than this That he thinks it a Service at this time to remove the  Mistakes which some make and others improve to our Disadvantage while they think it is to the Disadvantage of some Body else While they aim at an Object they would hurt they Wound themselves and in Prosecuting private or PartyPrejudices Injure Weaken and Assault the Publick Good which every Man has a Property in and therefore is in Duty bound to Defend  A Discourse upon  Credit  is naturally an Introduction to a Discourse upon  Loan    Credit  without  Loan  is a Beautiful Flower fair to the Eye fragrant to the Smell ornamental to the Plot of Ground it grows in but yielding neither Fruit nor Seed neither Profit to the Possessor of it by making due Advantage of its Produce or Benefit to Posterity by Propagation of its Species On the other Hand  Loans  without  Credit  are like the Labouring Plowman upon a Barren Soil who Works Cultivates Sweats and Toils but to no purpose all the Fruit of his Labour ends in Sterility and Abortion  Loans  are the Consequences of  Credit  and the Evidence of that particular Quality which in the preceding Discourse of  Credit  I lay'd down as its Foundation I mean General Probity Punctual Just and Honourable Management  To explain Things as I go tho' this needs but little By  Loans  I am now to be understood to mean  Lending Money to the present Government  The Thing will extend to private Affairs and I might take up a great deal of your Time in speaking of the Effects of  Credit  in Trade such as delivering Goods by Tradesmen to one another PaperCredit in Affairs of Cash Pledging Pawning and all the Articles of Security for Money practis'd in General Commerce but these Things are not to the present Purpose  The Author of this confines his Discourse to the Government Borrowing Money of the Subject whether upon Securities Establish'd by Parliament equivalent in Value deliver'd publick Faith general Credit or otherwise  The Nature of these Securities the Reason the Usefulness and the Foundation they stand on are no part of the present Subject they are reserv'd by the Author to a Head by themselves if Leisure and the publick Service make it proper to present you a Discourse upon  Funds  The present War which with a small Interval of an unsetled and Impolitick Peace is now in its d Year has been remarkable in several Circumstances above all the Wars that ever this Nation  has been Engag'd in since the  Roman's  possess'd it  It has been  The longest in it's Duration  The Fiercest and most Expensive in Blood  The most Famous in Successes and unheard of Victories  It has been carry'd on against the most Powerful Enemies  It has produc'd the most firm and the Greatest Confederacy  And it has in View the most Glorious Conclusion  Together with these Things it has this also peculiar to it that it has been carry'd on at an Expence which has surmounted not all that ever went before it only but all that it could be imagin'd was possible for any Nation of our Dimensions in the World to support  Not the  Fr  King only has been deceiv'd in the Efforts made by this Nation in the Process of the War which as penetrating as he is he never thought possible but is is most certain had the wisest and best Calculator in the Island been told what the Undertaking would have call'd for he would have determined it to be forty Millions Sterling beyond what the  Nation was able to do and that without selling the very Nation it could not be done  As the view of the Expence would have made us wisely have avoided the War and either not have begun it or long since ended it upon the best Terms we could obtain from the Enemy so had the Enemy believed  England  capable of supporting the War at such a prodigy of Expence he would never have begun it which the King of  France  himself has been heard in Terms very plain to acknowledge  When upon the Revolution the Parliment fell most willingly into the War as a thing the Enemy by espousing King  James  's Interest made absolutely Necessary The first Brach of our Expence was carried on in the common Road of levying Taxes and the Money required for every Years Expence was raised and paid within the Year  The Nation was rich Trade prodigiously great PaperCredit run high and the Goldsmiths in  Lombardstreet  c commanded immense Summs Anticipations were indeed in Practice they had been so of Old and borrowing Clauses were added to the Bills of Aid but these lasted but a few Months the Money  came in of course and they were paid off in their turn LandTax Polls additional Duties of Customs Excises and the like were the Ways and Means by which these things were done the Year generally supported its own Demands all the Loans were supposed to be Temporary and to end with the Collection  As the War every Year grew heavier upon us and the Expence increased new Ways and Means were necessary to supply the growing Demand till all the Taxes that could be raised by the ordinary Way were found little enough to bring the Annual Expence about  This put the Commissioners of the Treasury upon listening to new Taxes and entertaining all the Projects for raising Money that the working Heads of the Age could supply them with  These back'd with Parliamentary Authority were too unadvisedly supposed to raise such certain Summs as the Publick Occasions then call'd for and borrowing Clauses were added to them limitting the said Summs which pass'd as a giving the Treasury Credit upon the Acts of Parliament for such Summs as they were granted for but the Collections falling infinitely short of the Summs proposed left the Publick in Arrear to the  Lenders and from hence came the great Load of Deficiencies which the Nation feels the Weight of to this Hour  As the Summs given fell short so the War called every Year for still greater Summs which added to the Deficiencies of the old Taxes grew so heavy that our Mannagers found it was in vain to struggle with the Difficulty any Longer upon the foot of Annual Taxes and that it was next to impossible to raise every Year what the publick Occasions call'd for  This lead them of course to a new Method to supply the great Demands of the War  viz  by Establishing Annual Receipts of limited or perpetual Interests for such Summs as might be borrowed upon the Credit of the Nation the Principal to sink in the Hands of the Publick These were call'd FUNDS  To encourage the People to lend upon these Funds Premioes for advancing the Money large Interests and other Advantages were annex'd such as  per Cent per Annum  upon Annuities with Survivourship Chance of Prizes by way of Lottery  per Cent  upon Exchequer Bills  and the like  Here together with the innumerable Tallies which upon the Deficiency of former  Taxes as aforesaid went about the Town upon Discount and the great Obstruction of running Cash by calling in the old Coin was the first rise given to the Art and Mystery of StockJobbing a Practice whether good or evil in its Consequences to the publick Affairs is not to the present Purpose to enquire  By this Method has the greatest part of our Yearly Taxes since that time been raised the Parliament Establishing Funds for payment of Interest and the People advanving Money by way of Loan on those Interests  It may not be improper here for some People to reflect That in the Advantages granted by the Government upon these Loans and the great Discounts upon Tallies on the deficient Aids mentioned above were founded the great stocks of Money Banks and powerful Credit with which some People are grown to such a height especially in their own Opinion as to talk of influencing the publick Affairs and as it were menacing the Government with Apprehensions of their Lending or not Lending as they are or are not pleased with the Management of or Managers in the publick Oeconomy and this is the Subject I am a little to speak to  LOANS to the Government by the Gradations aforesaid having been found essentially Necessary the first Steps to that new Method were found fatally Incumbering the high  Premio's  given the great Advantages proposed and the large Interests paid to the Lender The Government appear'd like a distressed Debtor who was every Day squeez'd to Death by the exorbitant greediness of the Lender the Citizens began to decline Trade and turn Userers Foreign Commerce attended with the hazards of War had infinite Discouragements and the People in general drew home their Effects to embrace the Advantage of lending their Money to the Government Then grew up the BANK whose second Subscription being founded upon a Parliamentary Security for making good the deficient Tallies was formed by receiving in those Tallies at  Par  which cost the Subscribers but to  per Cent  by which the greatest Estates were raised in the least time and the most of them that has been known in any Age or in any part of the World  This I say turn'd the whole City into a Corporation of Usury and they appear'd not as a  Bank  but rather one general Society of Bankers all Men that  could draw any Money out of their Trades run with it to  ExchangeAlley  to buy Stocks and Tallies Subscribe to Banks or Companies or to the Exchequer with it to put into Loans and lend it upon the advantageous FUNDS settled by Parliament  It is meet to mention these things for the sake of the People who have gotten such great Estates by the Government to let them know from whence the Advantages they have made did proceed and also for some other Reasons which will appear in the sequel of this Discourse  The Government to preserve to themselves the Advantage of these Loans and yet to avoid being Imposed upon and Opprest by those exorbitant Interests and Encouragements about the Year entered into Measures to secure the Loan of Money and yet lower the Advantages given to the Lenders  The first was done by the Parliament apylying themselves to restore  Credit  by a Vote to make good all Deficiencies and Erecting a punctual just and fair Management of the Payments by which every several Engagement being Honourably complyed with the Credit of the publick Affairs reviv'd and the Exorbitances the former Years were exposed to wore off of course  This tedious Recapitulation of Things will appear less trouble to the Reader when he sees the use I shall make of it  Here may be seen several Things which if well considered tend to the lowring the high and extravagant Imaginations of some People with respect to  Loans    Credit    Borrowing  and  Lending  of Money to the Government such as these  I Large Interest Advantages  Premio's  for advance of Money and the like will bring in  Loans  in spight of Parties in spight of Deficiencies in spight of all the Conspiracies in the World to the contrary while a just honourable and punctual Performance on the part of the Government does but maintain the Credit of the Nation  II As the Affairs of the Government have made  Loans  necessary and they can not go on without Borrowing so the stream of Trade and Cash is so Universally turn'd into publick Funds the whole Ntiaon feels so much of gains so much by and depends so much upon the publick Credit that they can no more  do without the Funds than the Funds can do without the Loan  III These Borrowings and Lendings are become so much a Trade so many Families have their Employment from and get so great Estates by the Negotiating these Things that it is impossible for any particular Sett of Men to put a stop to it or to get any such Power into their Hands as to give the Government just Grounds of Apprehension that this or that Party of Men can put a Cheque to the publick Affairs be they  Whigs    Tories    City    Court    Banks    Company  or what they please to call themselves  I shall not tye my self to speak to these apart  the liberty of this Tract will not admit of it  but in a Summary way you will find the Fact Demonstrated and the Consequence Evident  Men in Trade more especially than the rest of Mankind are bound by their Interest Gain is the end of Commerce where that Gain visibly attends the Adventurer as no Hazard can discourage so no other Obligation can prevent the Application  Impiger extremos currit Mercator ad Indos  To pretend after this that Parties shall Govern Mankind against their Gain is to Philosophize wisely upon what  may be  and what would be Politick to bring to pass but what no Man can say was ever put in Practise to any Perfection or can be so by the common Principles that Govern Mankind in the World  There have been Combinations in Trade and People have seem'd to act counter to their present Interests nay have gone on in apparent Loss in pursuance of such Combinations but they have always been made in order to secure a Return of greater Gain and therefore the Laws made against such Combinations are not made to prevent Peoples going on to their Loss but to prevent the end of that appearing Loss  viz  the Ingrossment or Monopolizing of Trade to come at some Advantage over others and thereby make an exorbitant Gain  But it was never yet heard that the Zeal of any Party got the better so much of their Interest as to put a general Stop to the current and natural Stream of their Interest that a People should reject the fair and just Advantages which have raised so many Estates and are the due Supplies to the Breaches made by the War upon general Commerce To talk  that we will not lend Money to the Government while the Parliament settles Funds allows Interests gives  Premio's  and Advantages is to say Nature will cease Men of Money will abstain from being Men loving to get Money That Tradesmen should cease to seek Gain and Userers to love large Interests that Men that have gain'd Money should leave off desiring to get more and that Zeal to a Party should prevail over Zeal to their Families that Men should forfeit their Interest for their Humour and serve their Politicks at the price of their Interest  Let those that promise themselves these things enquire among the Merchants and see if Parties govern any thing in Trade if there is either  Whig  or  Tory  in a good Bargain Churchman or Dissenter in a good Freight High Church or Low Church in a Good Adventure if a Shopkeeper sees a good Pennyworth a Scrivener a good Mortgage a Money'd Man a good Purchase Do they ever ask what Party he is of that parts with it Nay rather in spight of Party Aversions do we not Buy Sell Lend Borrow enter into Companies Partnerships and the closest Engagements with oen another nay Marry with one another  without any Questions of the Matter  Let us come to the general Body of People as Fate has unhappily divided us where are the Men supposing a Party Conspiracy against the Government in this matter of Loan Where are the Men who would hold together and refuse making seven  per Cent  of their Money to preserve the Engagement Where the Men who would stay their Hands and lose the probability of gaining a Thousand Pounds a Year by a Lottery  No    no  it is not to be done the stream of Desire after Gain runs too strong in Mankind to bring any thing of that kind to Perfection in this Age The thing is so impracticable in its Nature that it seems a Token of great Ignorance in the Humour of the Age to suggest it and a Man would be tempted to think those People that do suggest it do not themselves believe what they say about it  In the matter of Loan it next comes in our way to enquire how does the Cash of the Nation which is the thing we are upon stand divided and how is the Government in hazard of any Combination of this kind If it be possible to make this Enquiry without any Party By ass and so as to give Offence to neither side  it shall be done I do not say who is in or who out who has the Management who had it or who would have it let that stand as it does or may but how do the Parties stand with respect to one another supposing any one Party would endeavour to stagnate the general Circulation of Credit in Prejudice of the other As for the purpose  Suppose a Whig Administration and all the High Church Men and their Appendices in hopes to reduce them to Exigences in the Management should Conspire together to run down the Publick Credit and lend no Money on any of the Funds  Vice Versa  suppose a Reverse and the Whigs in general should do the same thing Let us enquire Are either of these Parties sso rich in Cash so powerful in Lending that all the  Loans  must depend upon their Money or are either of these Parties so inconsiderable in this Case that their Support shall signify nothing without the concurrence of the other If the last were true that weak Party could make no manner of Figure in this Government or be significant enough for the Sovereign without visible Distraction to engage with To descend to Particulars  The Notion is general at least among themselves that the Gross of the Cash is with the Whigs and the  Review  speaks of it as a thing capable of some Demonstrations tho' with his good liking it may be said he may be mistaken Some have gone a length beyond the Author of the  Review  and will have it that the Money lies in the Hands of the Dissenters and will allow the Churchmen especially the HighChurchMen to have little enough for themselves and by consequence less to spare to the Publick Loans  Others will tell you the HighChurchParty have a large share of the Nation's Cash in their Hands that they have generally a Proportion of Money and beyond Comparison more Land than the other They add That as they have more Land they can when they please have more Money and that therefore tho' they should grant that the LowChurch and Dissenters put together have the most ready Money yet allowing them the Superiority in the Lands they can fetch the Money into their own Hands when they please  It is not for me to determine who has most Land or who most Money it is my Opinion neither have so much  or so little as to render them Formidable or Contemptible to one another in the Matter of Loan Both Sides have enough to be useful to and both Sides have little enough to stand in need of one another and in this Division the Ballance of Parties which at this time is the onely Felicity that we can find in having any Parties at all does consist  I make no Difficulty to Acknowledge That where the Land is there is the Foundation of all the real Wealth in the Nation I do not say it is in this or that Party exclusive That the Gentlemen who call themselves of the HighParty have a great share of the Land is most certain but that they have so much more than the Whigs and Dissenters join'd as some will alledge I cannot determine No doubt where the Land is there can be no want of Money because Land will at any time raise Money whereas Money without the Assistance of Trade Landedmen or Governments can operate no way but like the Viper preying upon it self  This leads me to Examine the Difference between  Loan  and  Fund  in this Case Examining which something may perhaps come to light for our Instruction  which has not been much thought of before  Solomon  tells us  The Borrower is Servant to the Lender  but with the Wiseman's leave in this Case it is not so  Solomon  is there to be understood speaking of the poor borrowing Wretch who Borrow'd upon the Foot of Charity and Compassion and therefore he just before says  The Poor uses many Entreaties but the Rich answer roughly  The poor Man that Borrows on his single Promise to supply his urgent Necessity  uses Entreaties  as we may say  He Begs to Borrow  but the  rich Lender  is surly hardly consents  answers Roughly  and is with Difficulty brought to Lend  But we are to Distinguish here between  Solomon  's Borrower describ'd as above and he that Borrows on a sufficient current Security He is no more Servant to the Lender than the Lender is Servant to him having an unquestion'd Security to give he scorns to ask you twice but if you do not think fit to lend your Money he goes to another  This is apparent in the  Public Securities  as well as in private and will make it out if ever put to the Test That the People of  England  stand in as much need of  the Funds  to lend their  Money upon as the Government stands in need of their Money  upon those Funds  I prove this by a matter of Fact fresh in your Memories and undeniable in all its Circumstances In the Beginning of the War when the Money lay abroad in TRADE the Knowledge of Affairs young and the People not apprized of the thing the Anticipations upon Taxes and Loans came heavy and were small  What drew them on  Large Premio's high Interests Chances of Prizes Survivorship and the like  Thus when the Necessities of the Government were great and their Credit young to Borrow the Lenders made their Market But when the Government found themselves  rich in Funds  their Demands  tho' great  yet not pressing Credit Establish'd the Parliament  the great Fund of Funds  and Center of Credit ready to make good Deficiencies and leaving no room for Jealousies in the Minds of the People  What was the Case  You took off your Premio's you drew no more Lotteries for Years you lower'd your Interest you brought your Annuities from to  per Cent  and your Interest on Tallies from to  per Cent per Ann  From  per Cent  upon ExchequerBills you came down to  per Cent  And what was the Consequence The Necessity of the Lenders being more to lodge their Money for Improvement than the Necessity of the Borrowers was to ask they came always down to your Price and had you brought the general Interest of Loans to  per Cent  they must have come down for Money is no longer Money than it can be improv'd  Nay    it is to be observ'd  the Eagerness of the People to bring in their Money encreased as the Advantages of Lending decreased Having no way to improve it better they were under an absolute Necessity of bringing it in for the sake of the Improvement  Are these any of the People who can be supposed to say to the Parliament They will not lend their Money It would almost provoke a Man to laugh at them You won't lend your Money Why what will you do with it  Perhaps you wont lend it to the Government  well  you will  then  lend it upon private Security upon Land and the like why then those you lend it to will lend it to the Government and so the Malice of the Affair will be lost and the Advantage too Will you run it into Trade  Do so by all means  Some of those Hands it will Circulate through  will lend it to the Government Your very  Export  and  Import  is a Loan to the Government In short the Government shall have your Money  first or last  do what you will with it  Suppose it were possible to divide this Nation into two Parts the Landedmen and the Money'dmen and the Government were to be put into the Hands of the  First  against the Consent of the  Last  and the Money'dmen knowing the Landedmen could not carry on the War without Money resolv'd to lend them none I mean as a Government What Course should the Landedmen take  In my Opinion they should pass an Act That none of those People should be admitted to lend any Money to the Government at all What then would be the Consequence They would be immediately distress'd with the Weight of Money without Improvement they would eagerly lend it to the Landedmen at  per Cent  upon their Land and they again lending it to the Government at and  per Cent  the Government would be supply'd and the Landedmen would get  per Cent  by the other Mens Money  I am not making Application but let any of the present Parties who Boast of  their having the Gross of the Money reflect what they would say if an Act were to pass That no  Whig  's Money or no  Dissenter  's Money or no HighChurchman's Money should be accepted upon Loan That they should not be allow'd a Transfer upon any Stock or to Buy any Annuity the Complaint would be very loud of their being excluded the common Advantages of their FellowSubjects and that paying their Share of Taxes they ought to have room for equal Improvements and ought not to be excluded  and this is true too  it would be hard Then they would run about to their Friends among the contrary Party shelter their Money under their Names and perhaps give ½  per Cent  or  per Cent  Commission to others to Lend Buy and Transfer for them And what would the Government feel in all this  The Case is this No Party can be so foolish to think they can be able stop the Loan of Money to the Government nor need the Government think of putting the Laws in Execution against such Combination  tho' if any such appear'd no doubt they might be prosecuted  Keep up but the Credit of Parliament and let that Parliament find Funds it is not in the Power of any Party of Men to Stop  the Current of Loans any more than they can Stop the Tide at  LondonBridge  in its constant Course of Flux and Reflux from and to the Sea  There is no doubt but the  French  have Agents amons us who would be glad to weaken our Hands in the War and prevent our Supplies for that Purpose From them it must be that these Notions creep into Peoples Heads  English  Men cannot in their common Senses be so weak telling us that we shall have no  Loans  is much at one to telling us we shall have no Recruits to our Army as while you can Pay Armies you shall never want Men so while you can pay Interest you shall never want  Loans  The Estates that some Men boast of by which they are enabled to Lend and made bold enough to threaten a stop of it were gain'd by Lending Those that have them are too eager to Encrease them those that want them too eager to Gain them by the same method and all too Covetous and too Selfish not to come into any good Proposal  The Worst these Men can do is by making things appear backward to raise the Rate of Interests and move the Parliament to add something to the usual Encouragements for lending and if the Nation pays  this who have they to blame for it Yet neither will they be able to do this the present Credit of the  British  Parliament putting it out of their Power for as the necessity of Lending will prompt on one Hand the undoubted Security of Parliamentary Credit removes all the Jealousies our Partymen would raise on the other  The Zeal some Men shew for their Country as well as Justice to the Government is nevertheless very Conspicuous in this who first to glorifie their PartyPrejudices would have the War miscarry rather than Money should be lent while such Men Manage as they pretend not to like secondly reproach some People with Designs to make Peace with  France  and yet endeavour by discouraging  Loans  to render it impossible for them to carry on the War  But both these will be disappointed While the Parliament Supports Credit and good Funds Support the Parliament Money will come in as naturally as Fire will ascend or Water flow nor will it be in the Power of our worst Enemies to prevent it  If the Author of this appears again in Publick it may be upon the Subject of FƲNDS  FINIS
