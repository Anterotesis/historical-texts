 A Word to the Wise OR AN EXHORTATION TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC Clergy OF  IRELAND  BY A Member of the Established Church  Homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto  DUBLIN Printed by GEORGE FAULKNER in  Essexstreet  MDCCXLIX  A Word to the Wise  BE not startled  Reverend Sirs  to find yourselves addressed to by one of a different Communion We are indeed to our Shame be it spoken more inclined to hate for those Articles wherein we differ than to love one another for those wherein we agree But if we cannot extinguish let us at least suspend our Animosities and forgetting our religious Feuds consider ourselves in the amiable Light of Countrymen and Neighbours Let us for once turn our Eyes on those Things in which we have one common Interest Why should Disputes about Faith interrupt the Duties of civil Life or the different Roads we take to Heaven prevent our taking the same Steps on Earth do we not inhabit the same Spot of Ground breath the same Air and live under the same Government  why then should we not conspire in one and the same Design to promote the common Good of our Country  We are all agreed about the Usefulness of Meat Drink and Clothes and without Doubt we all sincerely wish our poor Neighbours were better supplied with them Providence and Nature have done their Part no Country is better qualified to furnish the Necessaries of Life and yet no People are worse provided In vain is the Earth fertile and the Climate benign if human Labour be wanting Nature supplies the Materials which Art and Industry improve to the Use of Man and it is the Want of this Industry that occasions all our other Wants  The Public hath endeavoured to excite and encourage this most useful Virtue Much hath been done but whether it be from the Heaviness of the Climate or from the  Spanish  or  Scythian  Blood that runs in their Veins or whatever else may be the Cause there still remains  in the Natives of this Island a remarkable Antipathy to Labour You  Gentlemen  can alone conquer their innate hereditary Sloth Do you then as you love your Country exert yourselves  You are known to have great Influence on the Minds of your People be so good as to use this Influence for their Benefit Since other Methods fail try what  you  can do  Be instant in Season out of Season reprove rebuke exhort  Tim  ch  iv  ver    Make them thoroughly sensible of the Sin and Folly of Sloth Shew your Charity in clothing the naked and feeding the hungry which you may do by the mere Breath of your Mouths Give me Leave to tell you that no Set of Men upon Earth have it in their Power to do good on easier Terms with more Advantage to others and less Pains or Loss to themselves Your Flocks are of all others most disposed to follow Directions and of all others want them most and indeed what do they not want  The House of an  Irish Peasant  is the Cave of Poverty within you see a Pot and a little Straw without a Heap of Children tumbling on the Dunghill Their Fields and Gardens are a lively Counterpart of  Solomon  's Description in the Proverbs  I went  saith that wise King  by the Field of the slothful and by the Vineyard of the Man void of Understanding and lo it was all grown over with Thorns and Nettles had covered the Face thereof and the Stone Wall thereof was broken down  Prov  ch  xxiv  ver    In every Road the ragged Ensigns of Poverty are displayed you often meet Caravans of Poor whole Families in a Drove without Clothes to cover or Bread to feed them both which might be easily procured by moderate Labour They are encouraged in this vagabond Life by the miserable Hospitality they meet with in every Cottage whose Inhabitants expect the same kind Reception in their Turn when they become Beggars themselves Beggary being the  last Refuge of these improvident Creatures  If I seem to go out of my Province or to prescribe to those who must be supposed to know their own Business or to paint the lower Inhabitants of this Land in no very pleasing Colours you will candidly forgive a well meant Zeal which obligeth me to say Things rather useful than agreeable and to lay open the Sore in order to heal it  But whatever is said must be so taken as not to reflect on Persons of Rank and Education who are no Way inferior to their Neighbours nor yet to include all even of the lowest Sort though it may well extend to the Generality of those especially in the  Western  and  Southern  Parts of the Kingdom where the  British  Manners have less prevailed We take our Notions from what we see mine are a faithful Transcript from Originals about me  The  Scythians  were noted for Wandering and the  Spaniards  for Sloth and Pride our  Irish  are behind neither of these Nations from which they descend in their respective Characteristics  Better is he that laboureth and aboundeth in all Things than he that boasteth himself and wanteth Bread  saith the  Son  of  Sirach    ch  x  ver    but so saith not the  Irishman  In my own Family a Kitchenwench refused to carry out Cinders because she was descended from an old  Irish Stock  Never was there a more monstrous Conjunction than that of Pride with Beggary and yet this Prodigy is seen every Day in almost every Part of this Kingdom At the same Time these proud People are more destitute than  Savages  and more abject than  Negros  The  Negros  in our Plantations have a Saying  If Negro was not Negro Irishman would be Negro  And it may be affirmed with Truth that the very  Savages  of  America  are better clad and better lodged than the  Irish Cottagers  throughout the fine fertile Counties of  Limerick  and  Tipperary  Having long observed and bewailed this wretched State of my Countrymen and the Insufficiency of several Methods set on Foot to reclaim them I have recourse to  your Reverences  as the  dernier Resort  Make them to understand that you have their Interest at Heart that you persuade them to work for their own Sakes and that GOD hath ordered Matters so as that they who will not work for themselves must work for others The Terrors of Debt Slavery and Famine should one would think drive the most slothful to Labour Make them sensible of these Things and that the Ends of Providence and Order of the World require Industry in human Creatures  Man goeth forth to his Work and to his Labour until the Evening  saith the  Psalmist  when he is describing the Beauty Order and Perfection of the Works of God  Ps  civ  ver    But what saith the slothful Person  yet a little Sleep a little Slumber a little Folding of the Hands to Sleep  Pro  ch  vi  ver    But  what saith the  Wiseman so shall thy Poverty come as one that travelleth and thy Want as an armed Man  Pro  ch  vi  ver    All Nature will furnish you with Arguments and Examples against Sloth  go to the Ant thou Sluggard  cries  Solomon  The Ant the Bee the Beetle and every Insect but the Drone reads a Lesson of Industry to Man But the shortest and most effectual Lesson is that of  Saint Paul    if any Man will not work neither should he eat  Thess  ch  iii  ver    This Command was enjoined the  Thessalonians  and equally respects all  Christians  and indeed all  Mankind  it being evident by the Light of Nature that the whole Creation works together for Good and that no Part was designed to be useless as therefore the  Idle Man  is of no Use it follows that he hath no Right to a Subsistence  Let them work  saith the  Apostle    and eat their own Bread    Thess  ch  iii  ver    not Bread got by Begging not Bread earned by the Sweat of other Men but their  own Bread that which is got by their own Labour  Then shalt thou eat the Labour of thine Hands  saith the  Psalmist  to which he adds  happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee    Ps cxxviii  ver    intimating that to work and enjoy the Fruits thereof is a great Blessing  A slothful Man's Imagination is apt to dress up Labour in a horrible Masque but horrible as it is Idleness is more to be dreaded and a Life of Poverty its necessary Consequence is far more painful It was the Advice of  Pythagoras    to chuse the best Kind of Life  for that Use would render it agreeable reconciling Men even to the roughest Exercise By Practice Pains become at first easie and in the Progress pleasant and this is so true that whoever examines Things will find there can be no such Thing as a happy Life without Labour and that whoever doth not labour with his Hands must in his own Defence labour with his Brains  Certainly planting and tilling the Earth is an Exercise not less pleasing than useful it takes the Peasant from his smoaky Cabin into the fresh Air and the open Field rendering his Lot far more desirable than that of the Sluggard who lies in the Straw or sits whole Days by the Fire  Convince your People that not only Pleasure invites but Necessity also drives them to labour If you have any Compassion for these poor Creatures put them in Mind how many of them perished in a late memorable Distress through Want of that provident Care against a hard Season observable not only in all other Men but even in irrational Animals Set before their Eyes in lively Colours their own indigent and sordid Lives compared with those of other People whose Industry hath procured them hearty Food warm Clothes and decent Dwellings Make them sensible what a Reproach it is that a Nation which makes so great Pretensions  to Antiquity and is said to have flourished many Ages Ã¡go in Arts and Learning should in these our Days turn out a lazy destitute and degenerate Race  Raise your Voices  Reverend Sirs  exert your Influence shew your Authority over the Multitude by engaging them to the Practice of an honest Industry a Duty necessary to all and required in all whether  Protestants  or  Roman Catholics  whether  Christians    Jews  or  Pagans  Be so good among other Points to find Room for  This  than which none is of more Concern to the Souls and Bodies of your Hearers nor consequently deserves to be more amply or frequently insisted on  Many and obvious are the Motives that recommend this Duty Upon a Subject so copious you can never be at a Loss for something to say And while by these Means you rescue your Countrymen from Want and Misery you will have the Satisfaction to behold your  Country itself improved What Pleasure must it give you to see these waste and wild Scenes these naked Ditches and miserable Hovels exchanged for fine Plantations rich Meadows well tilled Fields and neat Dwellings to see People well fed and well clad instead of famished ragged Scarecrows and those very Persons tilling the Fields that used to beg in the Streets  Neither ought the Difficulty of the Enterprise to frighten you from attempting it It must be confessed a Habit of Industry is not at once introduced Neighbour nevertheless will emulate Neighbour and the Contagion of good Example will spread as surely as of bad though perhaps not so speedily It may be hoped there are many that would be allured by a plentiful and decent Manner of Life to take Pains especially when they observe it to be attained by the Industry of their Neighbours in no Sort better qualified than themselves  If the same gentle Spirit of Sloth did not sooth our Squires as well as Peasants one would imagine there should be no idle Hands among us Alas how many Incentives to Industry offer themselves in this Island crying aloud to the Inhabitants for Work Roads to be repaired Rivers made navigable Fisheries on the Coasts Mines to be wrought Plantations to be raised Manufactures improved and above all Lands to be tilled and sowed with all Sorts of Grain  When so many Circumstances provoke and animate your People to Labour when their private Wants and the Necessities of the Public when the Laws the Magistrates and the very Country calls upon them you cannot think it becomes you alone to be silent or hindmost in every Project for promoting the public Good Why should you whose Influence is greatest be least active why should you whose Words  are most likely to prevail say least in the common Cause  Perhaps it will be said the Discouragements attending those of your Communion are a Bar against all Endeavours for exciting them to a laudable Industry Men are stirred up to Labour by the Prospect of bettering their Fortunes by getting Estates or Employments but those who are limited in the Purchase of Estates and excluded from all civil Employments are deprived of those Spurs to Industry  To this it may be answered that admitting these Considerations do in some Measure damp Industry and Ambition in Persons of a certain Rank yet they can be no Let to the Industry of poor People or supply an Argument against endeavouring to procure Meat Drink and Clothes It is not proposed that you should persuade the better Sort to acquire Estates or qualify themselves for becoming Magistrates but only that you should set the lowest of the  People at Work to provide themselves with Necessaries and supply the Wants of Nature  It will be alledged in Excuse of their Idleness that the Country People want Encouragement to labour as not haveing a Property in the Lands There is small Encouragement say you for them to build or plant upon another's Land wherein they have only a temporary Interest To which I answer that Life itself is but temporary that all Tenures are not of the same Kind that the Case of our  English  and the original  Irish  is equal in this Respect and that the true  Aborigines  or natural  Irish  are noted for Want of Industry in Improving even on their own Lands whereof they have both Possession and Property  How many industrious Persons are there in all civilized Countries without any Property in Lands or any Prospect of Estates or Employments Industry never fails to reward her Votaries  There is no one but can earn a little and little added to little makes a Heap In this fertile and plentiful Island none can perish for Want but the Idle and Improvident None who have Industry Frugality and Foresight but may get into tolerable if not wealthy Circumstances Are not all Trades and Manufactures open to those of your Communion have you not the same free Use and may you not make the same Advantage of Fairs and Markets as other Men do you pay higher Duties or are you liable to greater Impositions than your fellow Subjects and are not the public Praemiums and Encouragements given indifferently to Artists of all Communions have not in Fact those of your Communion a very great Share of the Commerce of this Kingdom in their Hands and is not more to be got by this than by purchasing Estates or possessing civil Employments whose Incomes are often attended with large Expences  A tight House warm Apparel and wholesome Food are sufficient Motives to labour If all had them we should be a flourishing Nation And if those who take Pains may have them those who will not take Pains are not to be pitied they are to be looked on and treated as Drones the Pest and Disgrace of Society  It will be said the Hardness of the Landlord cramps the Industry of the Tenant But if Rent be high and the Landlord rigorous there is more need of Industry in the Tenant It is well known that in  Holland  Taxes are much higher and Rent both of Land and Houses far dearer than in  Ireland  But this is no Objection or Impediment to the Industry of the People who are rather animated and spurred on to earn a Livelihood by Labour that is not to be got without it  You will say it is an easy Matter to make a plausible Discourse on Industry  and its Advantages but what can be expected from poor Creatures who are destitute of all Conveniences for exerting their Industry who have nothing to improve upon nothing to begin the World with I answer they have their four Quarters and five Senses Is it nothing to possess the bodily Organs sound and entire That wonderful Machine the Hand was it formed to be idle  Was there but Will to work there are not wanting in this Island either Opportunities or Encouragements Spinning alone might employ all idle Hands Children as well as Parents being soon learned easily performed and never failing of a Market requiring neither Wit nor Strength but suited to all Ages and Capacities The Public provides Utensils and Persons for teaching the Use of them but the Public cannot provide a Heart and Will to be industrious These I will not deny may be found in several Persons in some other  Parts of the Kingdom and whereever they are found the comfortable Effects shew themselves But seldom very seldom are they found in these  Southern  People whose Indolence figureth a Lion in the Way and is Proof against all Encouragement  But you will insist how can a poor Man whose daily Labour goes for the Payment of his Rent be able to provide present Necessaries for his Family much less to lay up a Store for the Future It must be owned a considerable Share of the poor Man's Time and Labour goes towards paying his Rent But how are his Wife and Children employed or how doth he employ himself the rest of his Time the same Work tires but different Works relieve Where there is a true Spirit of Industry there will never be wanting something to do without Doors or within by Candlelight if not by Daylight  Labor ipse Voluptas  saith the Poet and this is verified in Fact  In  England  when the Labour of the Field is over it is usual for Men to betake themselves to some other Labour of a different Kind In the  Northern  Parts of that industrious Land the Inhabitants meet a jolly Crew at one anothers Houses where they merrily and frugally pass the long and dark Winter Evenings several Families by the same Light and the same Fire working at their different Manufactures of Wool Flax or Hemp Company mean while mutually cheering and provoking to labour In certain other  e g  Newport Pagnel  in  Buckinghamshire  Parts you may see on a Summer's Evening the common Labourers sitting along the Street of a Town or Village each at his own Door with a Cushion before him making Bonelace and earning more in an Evening's Pastime than an  Irish Family  would in a whole Day Those People instead of closing the Day with a Game on greasy Cards or lying stretched before the Fire  pass their Time much more chearfully in some useful Employment which Custom hath rendered light and agreeable  But admitting for the various Reasons above alledged that it is impossible for our Cottagers to be rich yet it is certain they may be clean Now bring them to be cleanly and your Work is half done A little washing scrubbing and rubbing bestowed on their Persons and Houses would introduce a sort of Industry and Industry in any one Kind is apt to beget it in another  Indolence in Dirt is a terrible Symptom which shews itself in our lower  Irish  more perhaps than in any People on this Side the  Cape of Good Hope  I will venture to add that look throughout the Kingdom and you shall not find a clean House inhabited by clean People and yet wanting Necessaries the same Spirit of Industry that keeps Folk clean being sufficient to keep them also in Food and Rayment  But alas our poor  Irish  are wedded to Dirt upon Principle It is with some of them a Maxim that the Way to make Children thrive is to keep them dirty And I do verily believe that the Familiarity with Dirt contracted and nourished from their Infancy is one great Cause of that Sloth which attends them in every Stage of Life Were Children but brought up in an Abhorrence of Dirt and obliged to keep themselves clean they would have something to do whereas they now do nothing  It is past all Doubt that those who are educated in a supine Neglect of all Things either profitable or decent must needs contract a Sleepiness and Indolence which doth necessarily lead to Poverty and every other Distress that attends it  Love not Sleep  cries  Solomon    lest thou come to Poverty    open thine Eyes and thou shalt be satisfied with Bread  Prov  ch  xx  ver    It is therefore greatly to be wished that you would persuade Parents to inure their  betimes to a Habit of Industry as the surest Way to shun the Miseries that must otherwise befal them  An early Habit whether of Sloth or Diligence will not fail to shew itself throughout the whole Course of a Man's Life  Train up a Child  saith the  Wiseman    in the Way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it  Prov ch xxii ver  The first Tincture often leaves so deep a Stain as no Afterthought or Endeavour can wash out Hence Sloth in some Minds is Proof against all Arguments and Examples whatsoever all Motives of Interest and Duty all Impressions even of Cold and Hunger This Habit rooted in the Child grows up and adheres to the Man producing a general Listlessness and Aversion from Labour This I take to be our great Calamity  For admitting that some of our Squires and Landlords are Vultures with Iron Bowels and that their Hardness and Severity is a great Discouragement  to the Tenant who will naturally prefer Want and Ease before Want and Toil it must at the same Time be admitted that neither is the Landlord generally speaking so hard nor the Climate so severe nor the Soil so ungrateful as not to answer the Husbandman's Labour where there is a Spirit of Industry the Want of which is the true Cause of our national Distress Of this there are many evident Proofs  I have myself known a Man from the lowest Condition of Life without Friends or Education not knowing so much as to write or read bred to no Trade or Calling by pure dint of Daylabour Frugality and Foresight to have grown wealthy even in this Island and under all the abovementioned Disadvantages And what is done by one is possible to another  In  Holland  a Child five Years old is maintained by its own Labour in  Ireland  many Children of twice that Age do nothing but steal or encumber the  Hearth and Dunghill This shameful Neglect of Education shews itself through the whole Course of their Lives in a matchless Sloth bred in the very Bone and not to be accounted for by any outward Hardship or Discouragement whatever It is the native Colour if we may so speak and Complexion of the People  Dutch    English    French  or  Flemish  cannot match them  Mark an  Irishman  at Work in the Field if a Coach or Horseman go by he is sure to suspend his Labour and stand staring till they are out of Sight A Neighbour of mine made it his Remark in a Journey from  London  to  Bristol  that all the Labourers of whom he enquired the Road constantly answered without looking up or interrupting their Work except one who stood staring and leaning on his Spade and him he found to be an  Irishman  It is a shameful Thing and peculiar to this Nation to see lusty Vagabonds strolling about the Country and begging  without any Pretence to beg Ask them why they do not labour to earn their own Livelihood they will tell you They want Employment offer to employ them and they shall refuse your Offer or if you get them to work one Day you may be sure not to see them the next I have known them decline even the lightest Labour that of Haymaking having at the same Time neither Clothes for their Backs nor Food for their Bellies  A sore Leg is an Estate to such a Fellow and this may be easily got and continued with small Trouble Such is their Laziness that rather than work they will cherish a Distemper This I know to be true having seen more than one Instance wherein the second Nature so far prevailed over the first that Sloth was preferred to Health To these Beggars who make much of their Sores and prolong their Diseases you cannot do a more thankless Office than cure them except it be to shave their  Beards which conciliate a Sort of Reverence to that Order of Men  It is indeed a difficult Task to reclaim such Fellows from their slothful and brutal Manner of Life to which they seem wedded with an Attachment that no temporal Motives can conquer nor is there humanly speaking any Hopes they will mend except their Respect for your Lessons and Fear of Something beyond the Grave be able to work a Change in them  Certainly if I may advise you should in Return for the Lenity and Indulgence of the Government endeavour to make yourselves useful to the Public and this will best be performed by rousing your poor Countrymen from their beloved Sloth I shall not now dispute the Truth or Importance of other Points but will venture to say that you may still find Time to inculcate this Doctrine of an  honest Industry  and that this would by no Means be Time thrown away if promoting your Country's Interest and  rescuing so many unhappy Wretches of your Communion from Beggary or the Gallows be thought worth your Pains  It should seem you cannot in your Sermons do better than inveigh against Idleness that extensive Parent of many Miseries and many Sins Idleness the Mother of Hunger and Sister of Theft  Idleness which  the  Son  of  Sirach  assures us  teacheth many Vices  The same Doctrine is often preached from the Gallows And indeed the Poverty Nakedness and Famine which Idleness entaileth on her Votaries do make Men so wretched that they may well think it better to dye than to live such Lives Hence a Courage for all villainous Undertakings which bringing Men to a shameful Death do then open their Eyes when they are going to be closed for ever  If you have any Regard as it is not to be doubted either for the Souls or  Bodies of your People or even for your own Interest and Credit you cannot fail to inveigh against this crying Sin of your Country Seeing you are obnoxious to the Laws should you not in Prudence try to reconcile yourselves to the Favour of the Public and can you do this more effectually than by cooperating with the public Spirit of the Legislature and Men in Power  Were this but done heartily would you but  be instant in Season and out of Season reprove rebuke exhort  Tim ch iv ver  such is the Ascendent you have gained over the People that we might soon expect to see the good Effects thereof We might hope  that our Garners would be soon full affording all Manner of Store that our Sheep would bring forth thousands that our Oxen would be strong to labour that there would be no breaking in nor going out  no Robbery nor Migration for Bread  and that there would be no Complaining in our Streets  Ps cxliv ver    It stands you upon to act with Vigour in this Cause and shake off the Shackles of Sloth from your Countrymen the rather because there be some who surmise that yourselves have put them on Right or wrong Men will be apt to judge of your Doctrines by their Fruits It will reflect small Honour on their Teachers if instead of Honesty and Industry those of your Communion are peculiarly distinguished by the contrary Qualities or if the Nation converted by the great and glorious  Saint Patrick  should above all other Nations be stigmatised and marked out as good for nothing  I can never suppose you so much your own Enemies as to be Friends to this odious Sloth But were this once abolished and a laudable Industry introduced in its Stead it may perhaps be asked who are to be Gainers I answer  your Reverences  are like to be great Gainers for every Penny you now gain you would gain a Shilling you would  gain also in your Credit and your Lives would be more comfortable  You need not be told how hard it is to rake from Rags and Penury a tolerable Subsistence or how offensive to perform the Duties of your Function amidst Stench and Nastiness or how much Things would change for the better in Proportion to the Industry and Wealth of your Flocks Duty as well as Interest calls upon you to clothe the Naked and feed the Hungry by persuading them to  eat  in the Apostle's Phrase  their own Bread  or as the  Psalmist  expresseth it  the Labour of their own Hands  By inspiring your Flocks with a Love of Industry you will at once strike at the Root of many Vices and dispose them to practise many Virtues This therefore is the readiest Way to improve them  Consult your Superiors They shall tell you the Doctrine here delivered is a sound Catholic Doctrine not limited to  Protestants  but extending to all and  admitted by all whether  Protestants  or  Roman Catholics    Christians  or  Mahometans    Jews  or  Gentiles  And as it is of the greatest Extent so it is also of the highest Importance  Saint Paul  expresly saith  That if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own House he hath denied the Faith and is worse than an Infidel  Tim ch v ver    In vain then do you endeavour to make Men Orthodox in Points of Faith if at the same Time in the Eyes of  Christ  and his  Apostles  you suffer them to be worse than Infidels than those who have no Faith at all There is something it seems worse than even Infidelity and to incite and stimulate you to put away that cursed Thing from among you is the Design and Aim of this  Address  The Doctrine we recommend is an evident Branch of the Law of Nature it was taught by Prophets inculcated by Apostles encouraged and enforced by Philosophers Legislators and  all wise States in all Ages and in all Parts of the World Let me therefore intreat you to exert yourselves  to be instant in Season and out of Season rebuke reprove exhort  Take all Opportunities to drive the Lion out of the Way raise your Voices omit no Occasion public or private of awakening your wretched Countrymen from their sweet Dream of Sloth  Many suspect your Religion to be the Cause of that notorious Idleness which prevails so generally among the Natives of this Island as if the  Roman Catholic  Faith was inconsistent with an honest Diligence in a Man's Calling But whoever considers the great Spirit of Industry that reigns in  Flanders  and  France  and even beyond the  Alps  must acknowledge this to be a groundless Suspicion In  Piedmont  and  Genoa  in the  Milanese  and the  Venetian State  and indeed throughout all  Lombardy  how well is the Soil cultivated and what Manufactures of Silk Velvet Paper and other Commodities flourish The King of  Sardinia  will suffer no idle Hands in his Territories no Beggar to live by the Sweat of another's Brow it has even been made penal at  Turin  to relieve a strolling Beggar To which I might add that the Person whose Authority will be of greatest Weight with you even the  Pope  himself is at this Day endeavouring to put new Life into the Trade and Manufactures of his Country  Though I am in no Secret of the Court of  Rome  yet I will venture to affirm that neither  Pope  nor  Cardinals  will be pleased to hear that those of their Communion are distinguished above all others by Sloth Dirt and Beggary or be displeased at your endeavouring to rescue them from the Reproach of such an infamous Distinction  The Case is as clear as the Sun what we urge is enforced by every Motive that can work on a reasonable Mind The Good of your Country your own private Interest the Duty of your Function the Cries and Distresses of the Poor  do with one Voice call for your Assistance And if it is on all Hands allowed to be right and just if agreeable both to Reason and Religion if coincident with the Views both of your temporal and spiritual Superiors it is to be hoped  this Address  may find a favourable Reception and that a Zeal for disputed Points will not hinder your concurring to propagate so plain and useful a Doctrine wherein we are all agreed  When a Leak is to be stopped or a Fire extinguished do not all Hands cooperate without Distinction of Sect or Party Or if I am fallen into a Ditch shall I not suffer a Man to help me out till I have first examined his Creed Or when I am sick shall I refuse the Physic because my Physician doth or doth not believe the  Pope  's Supremacy  Fas est et ab Hoste doceri  But in Truth I am no Enemy to your Persons whatever I may think of your Tenets On the contrary I am your sincere Wellwisher I consider you as  my Countrymen as FellowSubjects as professing Belief in the same  Christ  And I do most sincerely wish there was no other Contest between us but  Who shall most compleatly practise the Precepts of Him by whose Name we are called and whose Disciples we all profess to be  FINIS
