 AN ESSAY ON SCULPTURE  PERICLES  from a Bust in the Possession of Charles T  ley E  q  portrait of Pericles  AN ESSAY ON SCULPTURE IN A SERIES OF EPISTLES  TO JOHN FLAXMAN ESQ RA  WITH NOTES    THEMISTIUS Orat de Amicitia  Scrissi i sensi d'un cor sincero e bianco  Che se in vaghezza poi manca lo stile  Nel zelo almeno e nell amor non manco  SALVATOR ROSA  By WILLIAM HAYLEY Esq  LONDON  Printed by A Strahan Printers Street FOR T CADELL JUN AND W DAVIES IN THE STRAND  INTRODUCTORY LETTER TO  MR FLAXMAN  RECEIVE my dear friend with your usual kindness the longsuspended Work of which I had the pleasure of repeating to you a few verses as a joyous salute on your safe arrival from Rome in the year I then hoped to render it a more early and a more chearful tribute to your improved talents and to our long friendship My production is not such as I intended yet I trust in its present state it is not utterly unworthy of your acceptance or of that favour which every warm heart must be inclined to hope its endeavours to celebrate the genius of a friend may receive from the public  You know but too well what impediments of anxiety and affliction have thwarted for years the progress of a performance that the honest pride of friendship would have zealously laboured to make more worthy of the artist to whom it is inscribed I am yet willing to think that affliction so often useful in life may have had some sort of beneficial influence on this composition  Sunt lacrymae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt  As much as my Work has lost in knowledge and refinement by the severe trouble that interrupted and changed its course it may have gained perhaps in nature and pathos I could hardly convert the sufferings of your dear disciple to a use more noble than that of making them instrumental in any degree to the reputation of such an instructor  When I began the Poem I intended that it should comprize a sketch of modern as well as ancient art but  my attention has been turned from Donatello Ghiberti and their successors to the dearer juvenile artist who after the fairest promise of future excellence under your tender and animating care has been destined to lose the uncommon advantages he possessed and valued by a length of sickness and complicated sufferings  I have now watched you know considerably more than two years over this interesting invalide I have seen him enduring a horrible series and variety of increasing tortures yet in this very long trial of a martyr's constancy and courage I have never heard a single murmur escape from his lips but have beheld him triumph over the severest unmerited corporeal torments by the serenity fortitude and sweetness of a spirit truly angelic In a part of this long and distressing period I have resumed at his affectionate request my suspended Work and advanced in it by such troubled industry as those only can perfectly conceive who have forced the mind to labour  with motives of similar affection and with similar disquietude  Under such circumstances you will not blame me for allowing my just admiration of your affectionate and magnanimous though disabled disciple to alter the intended current of my verse Writing as I have ever done from the heart I have followed its imperious suggestions and your sympathy my dear friend which I am confident I shall obtain in this part of my subject will form at once my justification and my reward  For your credit I ought perhaps to apprize my reader that whatever defects he may discover in my Book they are to be ascribed solely to myself As my sequestered life has not allowed me to derive from several distant friends of intelligence far superior to mine on the subject which I presume to treat that light which might otherwise have embellished my composition I ought not to expose them to a suspicion of having suggested or countenanced any  erroneous ideas that a production of retired yet often interrupted study may happen to contain  To guard myself also from a charge of presumption it may be proper to declare that in venturing to write upon Sculpture I pretend not to instruct the accomplished artist or the real connoisseur two classes of men whom I ought rather to consult for information and from whom I must ever have much to learn but I had persuaded myself that by an extensive Poem on this untried subject I might be so fortunate as to promote the celebrity of a friend in whose talents I delight and afford some kind of assistance to all the admirers of Sculpture in their various endeavours to naturalize a deserving Art which may still be considered as little more than an alien in our country if we compare the portion of public notice and favour which it has hitherto obtained among us to the honour and influence it enjoyed in the ancient world  To encourage a general delight in the ingenious Arts and to extend the reputation of their successful professors has ever appeared to me one of the most desirable purposes that Poetry can pursue and particularly when that purpose is happily blended with the interest and the honour of friendship  Should the wishes of those whom I regard induce me in a season of more tranquillity and leisure to delineate the rise and progress of modern Art in another Poem for which I have abundant materials I shall probably introduce that new subject by a sketch of the injuries that Sculpture sustained from the sect of Iconoclasts or Imagebreakers and the animation it might acquire from the discovery of Herculaneum and a more spirited research in the subterranean cities  I intimate these topics to obviate any surprise that my reader might feel on not finding them mentioned in the present Work They appeared to me as more suited to  form the line of connexion between the two distinct provinces of ancient and modern Sculpture  But whatever fortune may attend me as the admirer and the eulogist of your noble art that you my excellent friend may long cultivate and improve it and that universal applause and increasing felicity may be justly and graciously bestowed by earth and Heaven on your labours and your life is the cordial wish of  Your very sincere and fervent Though deeplyafflicted friend W H  APRIL  EPISTLE THE FIRST  Cognatas artes studiumque affine sequamur  MILTON  ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST EPISTLE  Fervent wipes for the safety of the Sculptor returning from RomeA sketch of the studies and situation of the Author and his friendThe aim of the former in the present composition  EPISTLE I  INFURIATE WAR whose gory flags unfurl'd  Waft dire contagion round the madd'ning world  Spare in thy rage or in thy pride defend  Art's hallow'd pilgrim Virtue's gifted friend  The travell'd Sculptor after years of toil  Nobly pursu'd on many a foreign soil  Hast'ning with deepstor'd mind and practis'd hand  To prize and decorate his native land  Fierce as thou art those shadowy forms revere  By Science hoarded and to Fancy dear  Which in the plastic soul of Genius rest  Folded like future gems in Nature's breast  To peaceful Sculpture's unarm'd son accord  Safety and honour for no mean reward  He can requite thy favourhe can give  Thy dear lost heroes yet again to live  And faithful still to thee with martial fire  To speak in marble e'en till War expire  Thus ardent Flaxman while you now review  Rome's sculptur'd glories in a fond adieu  Now haste admonish'd by instructive Time  With filial pride to England's rougher clime  The studious hermit who in that dear isle  You left depriv'd of Health's inspiring smile  To prosper your return with votive lays  Resumes the lyre of friendship and of praise  Dear Student active as the Greeks of old  In toil as steady as in fancy bold  Blending of discipline each separate part  Diffusive knowledge with concenter'd art  And adding as you climb Discovery's hill  The scholar's learning to the sculptor's skill  Those years that roll'd o'er thee with lustre kind  Rip'ning thy labours much and more thy mind  Those years that gave thy faculties to shine  In mists of malady enshrouded mine  Think with what grief the spirit of thy friend  Anxious as thine but anxious to no end  Year after year of feverish sloth the prey  Has seen each project of his mind decay  And drop like buds that when the parent rose  Sick'ning in drought where no kind current flows  Feels parching heat its genial powers enthrall  Unblown unscented and discolour'd fall  Disease dread fiend whatever name thou bear  I most abhor thee as the child of Care  Nor fix'd of feature nor of station sure  Thy power as noxious as thy shape obscure  While thy cold vapours with a baleful gloom  Blight intellectual fruits howe'er they bloom  Yet e'en o'er thee in thy despotic hours  When thou hast chain'd the mind's excursive powers  Though to thy gloomy keep by pain betray'd  That mind can triumph by celestial aid  From thee dull monitor e'en then can learn  A mental lesson of most high concern  To know the suffering spirit's sure resource  And hail the hallow'd fount of human force  God of those grateful hearts that own thy sway  Howe'er their fibres flourish or decay  Safe in thy goodness with no will but thine  Thy dearest gifts I cherish or resign  Yet if by storms of many a season tried  And toss'd not sunk by life's uncertain tide  I yet may view benevolently gay  A brighter evening to my darken'd day  Grace it blest Power whate'er its date may be  With lustre worthy of a gift from thee  Poets dear Sculptor who to fame aspire  Fearless pretend to inspiration's fire  We boast of Muses who without reward  Furnish the favour'd harp with golden chord  Yet to be frank though pensive from my youth  I play'd with Fiction as a child of Truth  When my free mind in health's light vest was clad  A feeling heart was all the lyre I had  But quick as Memnon's statue felt the day  And spoke responsive to the rising ray  So quick the fibres of that heart I deem  Of excellence new risen to feel the beam  Feel the pure light a vocal transport raise  And fondly hail it with melodious praise  But Pain dear Flaxman the dull tyrant Pain  A new Cambyses broke this lyre in twain  Still like the statue sever'd on the ground  Though weaker still its wonted voice is found  Warm'd by that light they love the very fragments sound  See NOTE I    O could the texture of this suffering brain  The pleasing toil of patient thought sustain  Unwearied now as when in Granta's shade  Friendship endear'd the rites to Learning paid  When keen for action whether weak or strong  My minddisdain'd repose and to prolong  The literary day's too brief delight  Assign'd to social study half the night  With ardour then proportion'd to thy own  My verse dear Flaxman in a louder tone  Should lead thy country with a parent's hope  To give thy talents animating scope  Pleas'd ere thy genius its best record frame  To sound a prelude to thy future fame  But worn with anguish may thy bard command  Such notes as flow'd spontaneous from his hand  In that blest hour when his applauded Muse  Fond of no theme but what his heart might choose  Appear'd that heart's ambitious hope to crown  The happy herald of a friend's renown  When Truth reechoed her ingenuous praise  And our lov'd Romney triumph'd in her lays  The Arts and Friendship are angelic powers  Worshipp'd by me through all my chequer'd hours  My early offerings at their feet I cast  Be theirs my present song and theirs my last  If Health to him who oft with fruitless sighs  Watches the glance of her averted eyes  Those eyes whose light can wither'd minds renew  Those stars that shed an intellectual dew  If Health will yet her inspiration give  Call into life my verse and bid it live  Years that like visions vanish all by stealth  When Time is dancing to the harp of Health  But long long links of an oppressive chain  When his dull steps are told by lassitude and pain  Years have elaps'd since full of hope for thee  Thy bard though wreck'd on Study's restless sea  Yet aim'd to give by friendship's kind controul  Miltonic  See NOTE II  temper to thy fervent soul  And well hast thou to make those years conduce  To future honour and immediate use  Assign'd of early life thy studious prime  To bright Italia's artenlighten'd clime  That clime where Milton at an age like thine  Imbib'd the fervour of sublime design  As emulation wing'd his soul with fire  In song to triumph o'er the Tuscan quire  And Tasso's Muse with epic glory bright  Impell'd his fancy to a nobler flight  So may the modern lord of Sculpture's sphere  Whose mighty hand to many an art was dear  May lofty Angelo thy mind inflame  As happily to vie with Tuscan fame  Then shall thy country while thy works display  Force feeling truth and beauty's moral sway  Radiant at last with sculptural renown  A gem long wanting in her lucid crown  Feel new distinction animate her heart  And high precedence hold in every art  Pass not this presage in Detraction's eyes  For partial friendship's weak or vain surmise  'Tis hope well grounded such as heaven inspires  When man submits to heaven his proud desires  May'st thou my friend whose wellinstructed youth  Grav'd on thy heart this animating truth  "Talents are power which men from God deduce  "And best acknowledge by benignant use"  May'st thou by years of prosperous study reach  Remote Perfection that no precepts teach  May'st thou like Angelo and Milton close  A life of labour in divine repose  In that calm vale of years by Science blest  Where wellearn'd honour warms the veteran's breast  Acknowledg'd to reward his mental strife  A sovereign of the art to which he gave his life  Enough for me whose thrilling nerves confess  Sincerest transport in a friend's success  For me who hold in life's autumnal days  Private esteem more dear than public praise  If I may pour benevolently clear  Incentive notes in Friendship's partial ear  By zealous verse uninjur'd minds inflame  To toils of highest hope and hardest aim  Urge those I love in lovely arts to shine  And make their triumphs by affection mine  As when through hazards on a sea untried  Philanthropy and Fame the vessel guide  A crippled boatswain for Old England's sake  By his shrill note may abler seamen wake  To happier service than himself could yield  If yet unshatter'd on the watery field  O generous passion under just command  Enlighten'd fondness for our native land  Thy potent fire the Grecian arts refin'd  And made them idols of the cultur'd mind  From thee the hero as the artist caught  Vigour of nerve and dignity of thought  Great were thy wonders in the world of old  When glory triumph'd o'er inferior gold  But sceptics say that in the modern breast  The patriot passion is a sordid jest  The knavish politician's pompous mask  That to the wise betrays his secret task  To cheat a nation with fictitious zeal  And ape the noble warmth he ne'er can feel  O blind to Nature the false sage who thinks  That by the touch of Time her treasure sinks  The mighty Parent draws from heaven the power  Freely to lavish her exhaustless dower  That useful pride which under many a name  The spring of action in the human frame  Gives at all periods through her wide domain  Force to the heart and fancy to the brain  The fruit may fail as time and chance decree  But every age and soil produce the tree  That pride the generous root of Grecian praise  Lives yet unweaken'd lives in modern days  And oft it shoots as many bards attest  With attic vigour in an English breast  Say fervent Flaxman when with new delight  Thy travels led thee first to feast thy sight  Where Sculpture reigns and holds her triumph still  With hoarded miracles of ancient skill  When first thine eyes those darling forms survey'd  That make the colours of description fade  Feeling their potent charms in every vein  Till admiration rose almost to pain  Prov'd not thy swelling heart a proud desire  That if pure Health will guard thy mental fire  Thou by impassion'd Toil's repeated touch  For thy dear England may'st achieve as much  As ever Grecian hand for Greece achiev'd  When hands gave life to all the soul conceiv'd  Feelings like these the fervent Milton found  Roving in studious youth o'er Tuscan ground  Such of refin'd ambition justly proud  His candid spirit to the world avow'd  When of his lot he spoke his early sense  And consecrated life to toil intense  See NOTE III    Let pert Conceit whom lighter fancies guide  The aid of Toil and Piety deride  Let flippant Wit conceive them dull allies  That might forbid his active wing to rise  And with a swallow's flight to dart at gilded flies  Pure minds to whom the highest powers are given  Own what they owe to industry and heaven  Milton by ceaseless toil to glory climb'd  And strong devotion's fire his soul sublim'd  Meek Newton thus his modest wisdom taught  "All that I've done is due to patient thought  See NOTE IV  "  Hard is their fate most pitiably hard  Who feel the shatter'd mind from toil debarr'd  Whom on exploits of intellect intent  Distemper holds in Sloth's dark prison pent  Forbid in Fancy's favourite wilds to range  And destin'd with reluctance to exchange  Refin'd ambition's brave and spotless strife  For low and little cares of languid life  See NOTE V    How oft dear active friend in listless pain  Thy distant invalid has wish'd in vain  For strength through Roman fanes with thee to rove  And pausing near the Capitolian Jove  In scenes with solemn inspiration fraught  Catch the strong impulse of inspiring thought  While thou in mental luxury refin'd  Hast nobly banqueted thy thirsty mind  With all that art could yield or taste require  As purest aliment to Fancy's fire  While thy unwearied hand and soul elate  Have jointly toil'd to copy or create  My suffering mind would to itself complain  Too conscious that the cloister of the brain  Seem'd like a fabric ransack'd by a Goth  Whose cruel enmity and wasteful wrath  Defacing all that Truth had treasur'd there  Left but a cell for Sorrow's silent prayer  But hence desponding Sloth hence dull Complaint  That make e'en Pity's wearied spirit faint  If Health like Fortune with capricious sway  Chequers the course of life's contracting day  From each coy goddess with delight we learn  Long absence but endears the late return  Since my firm friend for travel's noblest use  Sail'd with the blessing of a sick recluse  I have not lost though cramp'd and cabin'd here  In fruitless sloth each intervening year  Though Health denied me limbs that might ascend  Rough Alpine heights with my excursive friend  A different cause and of a later date  Fixing to English ground my studious fate  Bade me no more that pleasing hope resume  With thee instructive guide to study Rome  See NOTE VI    The high and hallow'd bard whose Muse of Fire  May as I wish'd thy plastic hand inspire  Milton himself with unresisted sway  Held me from thee and Roman joys away  Justice and truth with strong affection join'd  Imperious rulers of the feeling mind  Urg'd me to vindicate from many a wrong  The slander'd paramount of English song  Happy dear friend if this reviving hand  The line of just resemblance may command  True as thy chissel that can marble warm  With all the life that speaks in outward form  O if in kind beneficence profuse  Heaven deigns at destin'd periods to produce  Superior spirits on this earthly stage  To light and elevate a grov'ling age  To shew how Genius bears Affliction's rod  And fix the desultory soul on God  Such the fond reverence of the world to claim  Nature to England gave in Milton's name  By darkness undismay'd by toil untir'd  When conscience dictated or Heaven inspir'd  First of poetic minds if fondly true  My willing heart has paid thee homage due  If this weak hand elaborately just  Clear'd thy bright image from detraction's rust  Teach me to baffle adverse Health's controul  With all thy fervency and force of soul  As amulets against all worldly ill  In my free breast thy sentiments instill  Not thy crude thoughts of democratic sway  The hasty fruits of a distemper'd day  But never changing with the changeful hour  Thy sense of human hopes and heavenly power  In one sensation onemy dearest pride  Well may I boast a heart to thine allied  In this my thoughts with thy frank words agree  That "if by Nature or by Fate's decree  "No toils of mine can teach me to ascend  "Heights of perfection that may wait my friend  "The powers of heaven or earth will ne'er prevent  "My mind's persisting in its favourite bent  "To joy in excellence and honour those  "On whom that coyest queen her smile bestows  See NOTE VII  "  Blest if to future time my verse descend  A just record of an excelling friend  Blest if with generous sympathy survey'd  And its pure aim against its failings weigh'd  It serve to quicken in the public mind  Love for those gentler arts that grace mankind  Thus my dear Flaxman while I now descry  Thy goddess Sculpture in my mental eye  Hoping the winds by her entreaties won  Will waft in safety home her travell'd son  Thy bard resuming longforsaken rhyme  Soothes in this rambling verse the anxious time  Musing if Heaven may to his mind afford  Joy's inspiration for a friend restor'd  How he may raise in that propitious hour  An altar worthy of thy guardian Power  Describe her progress from her distant birth  And all her bounty to th' embellish'd earth  Then how pure zeal in this enlighten'd isle  May court her presence may ensure her smile  And cherish hope that here she may attain  Dominion equal to her attic reign  Yes though fierce havoc in these frantic times  Makes each fine art recoil from mortal crimes  Yet in celestial wrath's relenting day  Those friends of earth shall reassume their sway  Angels of light who deeds of blood abhor  Enchain that homicidal maniac War  All hell's dire agents in one form combin'd  To fire the globe and demonize mankind  Let Arts that render men divinely brave  To Peace's temple turn Destruction's cave  And form to counteract infernal strife  New bonds of friendship and new charms of life  THE END OF THE FIRST EPISTLE  EPISTLE THE SECOND  Daedala signa polire  Usus et impigrae simul experientia mentis  Paulatim docuit pedetentim progredientis  LUCRETIUS  ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND EPISTLE  Invocation to SculptureDifferent ideas on the origin of ArtA sketch of its progress in Asia Egypt and the early ages of Greece  EPISTLE II  THOU first and simplest of the Arts that rose  To cheer the world and lighten human woes  Friend of the mourner Guardian of the tomb  May I chaste Sculpture without blame presume  Rude in thy laws thy glory to relate  To trace through chequer'd years thy changeful fate  And praise thee forming with a potent hand  Thy new dominion in my native land  While zeal thus bids the breath of incense roll  From that pure censer a benignant soul  And with the fond sincerity of youth  Would blazon merit in the tints of truth  Enlivening Friendship shall those aids supply  That injur'd health and troubled years deny  Her hallow'd fire like Inspiration's beam  May raise the poet to his honour'd theme  As deathlike clay dear Flaxman to fulfil  The kind behest of thy creative skill  Lives at thy touch and with affection warm  Of changeful beauty wears each varying form  So languid thought that lifeless and disjoin'd  Floats a dark chaos of the cumber'd mind  At Friendship's bidding in new shapes may shine  With each attractive charm of just design  And gain from her as an immortal dower  The vivid grace of that inspiring power  In lucid order teach my verse to rise  Dear as a magic glass to Sculpture's eyes  Where thy pleas'd goddess may with pride survey  Her ancient honours and her future sway  What eye may hope to pierce the distant gloom  Where in their cradle shadowy as the tomb  Breathing scarce breathing the dark air of strife  The infant Arts first struggled into life  There are who led by Fancy's airy clue  In Scythian wilds the birth of Sculpture view  And image to themselves her youthful hand  Prompted by dark Devotion's fond command  To form of yielding stone or ductile clay  An early symbol of Almighty sway  The bull's stern front to which rude myriads kneel  The favourite idol of benighted zeal  See NOTE I    Others a softer origin assign  To the young beauties of this art benign  To Love inspiring the Corinthian maid  Fondly to fix her sleeping lover's shade  And her kind sire's congenial skill they trace  The new attraction of a modell'd face  See NOTE II    The king whose power by intellect refin'd  Enthron'd each science in his ample mind  Tells in his hallow'd page how Sculpture rose  To soothe the anguish of parental woes  How first a father in affliction's storm  Of his dead darling wrought the mimic form  Impassion'd Nature's laudable relief  Till impious worship grew from tender grief  See NOTE III    No single region of the spacious earth  Can take exclusive pride in Sculpture's birth  Wherever God with bounty unconfin'd  Gave man his image a creative mind  Its lovely children Arts mimetic sprung  And spoke through different lands in every tongue  Though keen research elate with Learning's pride  From vain conjecture would in vain decide  How Sculpture first in early twilight's hour  Made the first essay of her infant power  Though clouds of fabulous tradition hide  Her fam'd Prometheus her primaeval pride  See NOTE IV    Still can the eyes of Fancy and of Truth  Behold her shining in attractive youth  By Love by Grief by Piety caress'd  Alternate nursling of each hallow'd breast  Rear'd by their care to work as each inspires  And fondly ministring to their desires  Where first imperial Pride with wealth her dower  Spoke in a voice of vivifying power  And charm'd in Asia with her new domain  Summon'd the Arts as vassals of her train  Sculpture perchance ennobled by her sway  Gave her first wonders to the eye of day  If credulously fond the Muse may speak  Nor doubt the bold description of a Greek  Her favourite Art's primaeval skill was seen  To form the semblance of that Syrian queen  Whose daring hand the dart of triumph hurl'd  Who rul'd in Babylon the eastern world  And pleas'd the bounds of transient life to pass  Aim'd at eternal sway in animated brass  See NOTE V    Alas how vain in Asia's crumbling soil  Prov'd the proud efforts of imperial Toil  Where are thy wonders Babylon What eye  May now a vestige of thy art descry  The cautious students in historic lore  Question the marvels they in vain explore  Thy boasted sights a splendid fable deem  And hold Semiramis herself a dream  See NOTE VI    But haste thou lovely goddess of my lays  Whose varying powers command my willing praise  Lead me from ruins where I hardly meet  Uncertain traces of thy longpast feet  To scenes of solid though of gloomy truth  The dark asylum of thy busy youth  Hail Aegypt hail laborious patient land  Sublime in purpose in performance grand  Thy steady spirit to young Sculpture taught  To scape destruction in the works she wrought  And blind Oblivion's torrent swell'd by storms  Has fail'd to bury thy colossal forms  If taste fastidious may with scorn deride  Aegyptian tributes to despotic pride  If Wonder stand in joyless trance aghast  At regal blocks elaborately vast  Protentous copies of a mortal frame  Though firm uncouth and though enormous tame  If Fancy shrink from Superstition's shapes  Dogheaded gods and consecrated apes  From dark conceits to Learning's self unknown  And the mute riddle on the mangled stone  Yet highly Aegypt of thy worth I deem  And view thy patient efforts with esteem  Is it not wonderful and worthy praise  That men untouch'd by Inspiration's rays  Strangers to Freedom gaiety and grace  Could build renown upon a lasting base  And all the ravage of destruction foil  By the calm powers of persevering toil  Yes Aegypt here let thy just praise be read  Thy tender rev'rence for the virtuous dead  And thy fond care by Sculpture's noblest aim  To give beneficence a deathless name  Time on that care bestows the wish'd effect  And guards thy massive monarchs with respect  See NOTE VII    Let not nice Taste of purer fancy vain  This praise of old and graceless art arraign  Should a magician usher to our view  An Ancient wrinkled dame of dingy hue  Bigbon'd and stiff and muttering mangled verse  Then should he say with truth "See Helen's nurse"  The swarthy beldam friendly hands would shake  And all would bless her for her nursling's sake  Such Memphian art to attic minds endear'd  For Greece their Helen was by Aegypt rear'd  See NOTE VIII    Ye first and fairest of ideal forms  Whom beauty decorates and passion warms  Ye Graces who beheld with just delight  All Greece one temple by your presence bright  Conduct a modern bard in fancy's hour  To view that temple conscious of your power  Conscious your favour full success ensures  The paths of knowledge truth and fame are yours  See NOTE IX    Your aid a vital charm to toil imparts  The deathless soul of transmigrating arts  Offspring of Freedom and of Feeling you  Outlive your parents and their life renew  Immortal in their works your endless sway  Can bring departed talents into day  Convince the world your influence sublime  Fears no fictitious bars of soil or clime  Exalt my country with your kindest smile  And raise an Athens in this northern isle  My daring verse avows the patriot aim  To quicken Britain's love for boundless fame  To raise her pitch of emulation high  With Grecian Sculpture's perfect sons to vie  When foreign pride would British minds enchain  Perish the doubt preposterously vain  That mental tyrants arrogantly start  To limit England in the sphere of art  See NOTE X    Has she not borne to men and angels dear  A poet who beyond his Greek compeer  In Fancy's field the disk of glory hurl'd  The hallow'd Homer of the Christian world  Associate Arts alternate lustre lend  Each in her hour appears a sister's friend  Say why in sculpture Greece has reign'd supreme  Nature with marble gave her rocks to teem  And fostering Freedom bade her chissel trace  Unfetter'd forms of dignity and grace  Propitious both to Art but higher still  Flows the bright fountain of her plastic still  Homer first vivifi'd the public mind  Arm'd it with strength with elegance refin'd  From him that mind with images replete  As Sculpture potent and as Painting sweet  Grew by degrees in various branches bright  Congenial faculties pursu'd his flight  And Phidias rose while Art and Nature smil'd  The mighty poet's intellectual child  Whom Sculpture boasted in her proudest hour  By Heaven invested with Homeric power  When truer to itself the British mind  More keen for honours of the purest kind  To Milton's genius such regard shall pay  As Greece for Homer gloried to display  Like Phidias then her sculptors shall aspire  To quicken marble with Miltonic fire  And attic deities shall yield the palm  To lovelier forms seraphically calm  Fine Art's important growth in every clime  Requires the slow progressive aid of Time  In Greece where Sculpture reach'd such heights at last  That Nature smiling own'd herself supass'd  Observe how ages her long childhood nurs'd  And how her ripen'd charms excell'd the first  Behold her Daedalus whom fables praise  The boast and wonder of her early days  He daring artist in a period dark  In deathlike forms infus'd a living spark  He loosen'd from the side the lifeless arm  Gave to the open'd eyes a speaking charm  And such an air of action to the whole  That his rude statue seem'd to have a soul  Thou great artificer of deathless fame  Thy varied skill has prov'd the sport of Fame  Who shews half shrouded in the veil of Time  Thy real talents thy imputed crime  A crime as false in Reason's friendly sight  As through the buoyant air thy fabled flight  Theseus and Hercules with thee combin'd  By different toils to meliorate mankind  They labour'd to secure by glorious strife  And thou by glorious arts to sweeten life  Though dim traditions all thy merit show  Too well one feature of thy fate we know  Genius and misery so oft on earth  Severely blended in the lot of worth  These both were thine and both in rare extremes  Yet both were recompens'd by glory's beams  Thy native Athens in thy praise was loud  And grateful Aegypt to thy image bow'd  Ruin has sunk within her drear domain  Thy attic figures thy Aegyptian fane  Glory still grants thy fav'rite name to grace  One monument that Time can ne'er deface  Where Pathos while her lips thy pangs rehearse  Shews thy parental heart enshrin'd in Virgil's verse  Unhappy genius of a brutal age  Admir'd and spurn'd by ignorance and rage  Though styl'd a murd'rer who with envy blind  Kill'd the keen scholar to his charge consign'd  Though doom'd to sorrow's most oppressive weight  To mourn a darling son's disastrous fate  Just Heaven allow'd thy tortur'd mind to rest  On one disciple in thy guidance blest  Thy kind Endaeus joy'd thy lot to share  Thy friend in exile and in art thy heir  A witness of his skill Minerva stood  Colossal deity in sculptur'd wood  And from his touch lessyielding ivory caught  Of life the semblance and the air of thought  The different uses of an art divine  From thee he learnt for Art's wide field was thine  Rich though yet rude where her prophetic eyes  Saw distant wonders from thy genius rise  Whose native strength like England's early sage  Bursting the barriers of a barbarous age  Emerg'd while Nature bade thy mimic strife  Make bold advances to ideal life  Not vain O Daedalus thy toil to raise  A varied column of inventive praise  Though lost to sight each boldlylabour'd mass  Of wood of stone of ivory of brass  That from thy spirit vital semblance won  Though Time unfeeling crush'd thy sculptur'd son  Whose form more fondly labour'd than thy own  In radiant bronze with radiant lustre shone  And long to strangers would thy love attest  An idol of the land that gave thee rest  Though these were sunk in early ruin still  An happier offspring of thy plastic skill  Schools of Greek art arose with spirit free  And blest a bold progenitor in thee  See NOTE XI    Aegina like the morning's early rays  And Corinth bright as the meridian blaze  Sicyon ingenious Beauty's native earth  And Rhodes who gloried in Minerva's birth  Hence Sculpture drew her nurseries of skill  Rich as a river fed by many a rill  While earth and Heaven exult in its advance  To shine reflected in its bright expanse  Nor there alone did liberal Art display  The sweet enchantment of her early sway  Even rough Sparta though engross'd by arms  Esteem'd the patient chissel's softer charms  Proud of her dauntless race in battle tried  She rear'd a sculptor with parental pride  Pleas'd that her son Gitiades combin'd  Three kindred arts in his accomplish'd mind  He built he deck'd with bronze Minerva's fane  Then sung the goddess in a hallow'd strain  The triple homage won her kind regard  And from oblivion sav'd the artist and the bard  See NOTE XII    But like the cast of Spartan manners coarse  And slighting softer charms for sinewy force  E'en Grecian art through all its studious youth  Reach'd not the latent grace of lovely Truth  Her chiefs her gods as in a mental storm  Aw'd with a proud austerity of form  Yet Sculpture's sons with Nature in their view  Increas'd in talents and in honour grew  Such power Dipaenus gave to Parian stone  That gods appear'd to make his cause their own  And Terror thought they curs'd the sterile soil  Where haste insulted his unfinish'd toil  See NOTE XIII    Thy sons Anthermus with a filial pride  Their dear hereditary talents plied  And bade the measure of her fame to fill  Their native Chios glory in their skill  But in an evil hour of angry haste  They with malignant skill their art debas'd  Pleas'd to devote to mockery's regard  The homely visage of no trifling bard  Hipponax fam'd for acrimonious song  Soon with Iambic rage aveng'd the wrong  Deform'd of soul Derision fann'd the strife  But the mild patrons of enlighten'd life  The nobler Graces mourn'd the bickering hour  And blam'd the mean abuse of mental power  See NOTE XIV    For aims more worthy of an art divine  A purer fame Antenor shall be thine  Whose skill to public reverence consign'd  The patriot idols of the Grecian mind  The young Tyrannicides whose dauntless soul  Disdain'd submission to usurp'd control  Whose brave achievement and whose blended praise  Athens rehears'd in her convivial lays  Athens exulting those dear forms to see  Whose very silence cried aloud "Be free  See NOTE XV  "  Instructive Sculpture chaste and awful queen  Of Arts that dignify this earthly scene  Thy finest skill thy most empassion'd powers  Form'd to outlive the pencil's fading flowers  Are well devoted as true honour's prize  To Freedom's son who for his parent dies  For she the prime ennobler of the mind  That wanting her blest beam is weak and blind  Freedom of Excellence the fostering friend  Whom Virtue loves and Sciences attend  Freedom first made in Greece her favourite land  Beauty and Force the creatures of thy hand  She taught thee with such forms to deck thy sphere▪  As wise Idolatry may yet revere  Forms in which Art refin'd on Nature's plan  At once resembling and surpassing Man  'Twas in the splendor of those glorious days  When attic valour won eternal praise  When happy to have clear'd her cumber'd coast  From fierce Invasion's foil'd barbaric host  Exulting Liberty to Sculpture cried  "Aid thou our triumphs and our joys divide  "Since I and Nature in this scene conspire  "To warm accomplish'd minds with happiest fire  "That Fame may see them in her fane preside  "And deem her attic sons her dearest pride  "To memorize their noble forms be thine  "Grace thou the mortal with an air divine  "That Grecian excellence eluding fate  "Age after age may shine supremely great  "That Greece herself and every polish'd clime  "May through the long vicissitudes of time  "Hail those who sav'd her from Oppression's rod  "The patriot hero or the guardian god"  So Freedom spake and at her potent call  Obedient Sculpture peopled every hall  The generous artist fix'd with proud delight  The state's brave champions in the public sight  And grateful Genius felt his powers expand  While public virtue taught his willing hand  To honour chiefs who every danger brav'd  And decorate the land their valour sav'd  Nor gave just Gratitude to man alone  This vital tribute of expressive stone  But to Athenians who in beauty's form  Repress'd their female fear in ruin's storm  Who in the hour when their delightful home  Domestic altars and each sacred dome  Were seen to sink in fate's barbaric blaze  Disdain'd despair and look'd for happier days  In Grecian arms still daring to confide  With tender fortitude and virtuous pride  Pleas'd in Trezene's sheltering walls to wait  Till attic force restor'd their native state  Ye patient heroines not vain your trust  By love suggested and to valour just  Athens the favourite theme of every tongue  A real Phenix from her ashes sprung  Athens endear'd to every feeling heart  A throne of Genius and a mine of art  Athens was proud your conduct to review  She to your courage rais'd memorials due  And with your sculptur'd charms Trezene deck'd  Who sav'd her fugitives with fond respect  Ye heroines of hope whose force of mind  Induc'd relenting Fortune to be kind  Teach me to copy what I justly praise  Teach me like you in dark affliction's days  Now while the lyre by sorrow's stern command  Sinks in forc'd silence from my troubled hand  Teach me to wait in Quiet's friendly bower  The future sunshine of a fairer hour  See

ye demigods of ancient days  Whose life was energy whose passion praise  What patriot rapture must your hearts have known  When with new charms your native Athens shone  Conspiring Arts strain'd every nerve to crown  Their rescu'd darling with unmatch'd renown  And of those earthennobling Arts who strove  Fost'ring her glory to ensure her love  Nor last nor least O Sculpture was thy claim  Delightful minister of deathless fame  E'en at this day when Time's illusive cloud  Enwraps departed empire like a shroud  Rending Oblivion's veil in Fancy's sight  Thy Greciansons my willing praise invite  Thy Myron first of that accomplish'd race  Who gave to ruder forms true vital grace  See him with smiles his brazen cow caress  While herds applausive round the sculptor press  His work they hail with fond amazement wild  And deem their kindred statue Nature's child  A numerous train of rival bards rehearse  His brazen heifer's praise in partial verse  But not to brutes was his pure art confin'd  Myron in nobler forms infus'd a mind  'Twas his in Bacchus' fane that god to place  With such commanding and such cheerful grace  That the pleas'd eye of potent form the test  Gladly the joyinspiring power confest  'Twas his with genius in position rare  To show the labouring limbs with learned care  His keen Discobolos in every part  Spoke toiling Nature trac'd by patient Art  And his fleet Ladas train'd for Piza's prize  Hope in his heart impatience in his eyes  Through all his shape express'd his eager soul  A thirst for praise and panting for the goal  See NOTE I    Of higher studies and superior note  See Polycletus his strong mind devote  To frame for studious youth instruction's plan  And found his precepts on his faultless man  The model fam'd through longsucceeding time  Display'd young Vigor in his martial prime  Nor did thy female forms with weaker claim  Accomplish'd artist at perfection aim  Witness Ephesian Dian's ample fane  Fill'd with her active Amazonian train  By many a sculptor emulously keen  These rival nymphs highwrought enrich'd the scene  There where the judges of thy art declare  Which figure they pronounce supremely fair  How great the triumph of thy chaste design  The Amazon of Phidias yields to thine  See NOTE II    But as low vallies to the mountain grove  As humble deities to awful Jove  Such in his time was every fam'd compeer  With Phidias match'd in Art's sublimest sphere  Where the rapt mind to Heaven itself convey'd  Imbibes celestial form by Fancy's aid  And gives adoring mortals to survey  Features that indicate Almighty sway  Genius of ancient Greece whose influence ran  Through every talent that ennobles man  O'er bright ideas taught the mind to brood  And feast on glory as its native food  Bear me in vision bear me to that ground  Where Honor's fervent spirit breath'd around  Where gay Distinction held the garland high  And thy prime wonders gladden'd every eye  Thy favourite precincts at my wish appear  Where hymns of triumph fill the raptur'd ear  My eager feet have pass'd thy olive grove  And touch the threshold of Olympian Jove  Lo in calm pomp with Art's profusion bright  Whose blended glories fascinate the sight  Sits the dread power Around his awful head  The sacred foliage of the olive spread  Declares that in his sovereign mind alone  Peace ever shines and has for ever shone  The temple's spacious precincts scarce enfold  The grand quiescent form of ivory and gold  The symbols of his sway on either hand  Delight and reverence at once command  Behold his right sweet Vict'ry's image bear  Form'd like his own elaborately fair  His left a sceptre with rich light invests  And tranquil on its point his eagle rests  His sandals are of gold a golden robe  Proclaims his empire o'er the living globe  For earth's mute creatures on his vest are seen  With flowers and first the lily as their queen  The rich compartments of the throne enfold  Ivory with ebony and gems with gold  Adorn'd with images four massive feet  Sustain the radiance of the regal seat  Around each foot four joyous forms advance  Four Vict'ries weaving a triumphant dance  The throne's high summit shapes more lovely still  With animation and with beauty fill  The Graces here upon their parent wait  His filial Seasons there and both in triple state  The labouring eye with admiration smit  Labours in vain each figure to admit  That blended arts conspiring toil'd to raise  On this grand spectacle surpassing praise  Yet here all eyes the skilful and unskill'd  Impress'd with awe and with amazement fill'd  From the blest features of the god imbibe  Such thoughts as meliorate his mortal tribe  Phidias all vouch thy fame though not in speech  Thine the prime glory pagan minds could reach  Thine to have form'd in superstition's hour  The noblest semblance of celestial power  Illustrious artist in thy signal lot  What stains the glory of thy country blot  Genius of Athens sorrow seals thy lips  And all thy splendour sinks in dark eclipse  When history shews with a regret benign  The sins of base ingratitude were thine  Ingratitude to men whose skill sublime  Gave thee to triumph o'er the rage of time  How Phidias was thy heart with anguish stung  When public malice by thy pupil's tongue  Charg'd thee whose mind was cast in honor's mould  With the mean sacrilege of pilfer'd gold  But thee thy Pericles that noble name  Who rear'd thy talents and who shares thy fame  By generous Friendship's providential care  Rescu'd from Slander's execrable snare  Vengeance was thine that vengeance just and grand  Which fires wrong'd genius with an eager hand  Of national iniquity to foil  Th' oppressive aim by new and nobler toil  Till Envy's self with wonder stand aghast  Seeing the works that wak'd her rage surpass'd  So with himself this injur'd artist strove  His farfam'd Pallas yielded to his Jove  And grateful Elis proud new palms to gain  Boasted with truth of Phidias justly vain  That Athens was eclips'd by her Olympian fane  See NOTE III    Still dear to fame though fickleness thy joy  Urg'd thee by turns to cherish and destroy  The very excellence thy breast supplied  Child of thy love and nursling of thy pride  Even thy foes O Athens mourn'd thy fate  When fierce Lysander thunder'd at thy gate  And all thy wounded Arts felt War's o'erwhelming weight  War whence the worst of human misery springs  The people's folly and the guilt of kings  Thy Pericles whose talents seem'd to claim  A monarch's empire with a patriot's name  He thy untitled king whose liberal mind  Genius enrich'd and discipline refin'd  Whose potent voice control'd a people free  As Heaven's presiding breath commands the sea  He who delighted on fine Art to raise  The deathless fabric of his country's praise  Taught public wealth to rear ingenious worth  Exalted Nature and embellish'd earth  He by mild virtues to the world endear'd  Whose dying boast Humanity rever'd  E'en he by fits of martial frenzy sway'd  To blood's dire demons a rash offering made  And blind to ill his nature must abhor  Hurried his nation to that fatal war  Whose lengthen'd horrors on his Athens threw  Disgrace that Death hid kindly from his view  When at the savage Spartan's foot she lay  Her shame his pride her ornaments his prey  See NOTE IV    Wherever Liberty when doom'd to weep  In transient pangs or sink in deathlike sleep  Lost her quick spirit wounded or betray'd  Her foster'd Arts with filial grief decay'd  But short in Athens was the baleful course  Of envious Tyranny and Spartan force  Her thirty tyrants with a robber's dread  From the just arm of Trasybulus fled  His patriot virtue burst the servile yoke  And bright from brief eclipse effulgent Freedom broke  Attendant Arts her satellites appear  And shed new lustre round her Attic sphere  When happy Genius by a daring flight  Has seem'd to perch on proud Perfection's height  Afraid on disproportion'd wings to rise  Aw'd and abash'd weak Emulation dies  Such fate had Poesy for Homer's Muse  No Greek with prosperous rivalship pursues  Sculpture more fruitful though she joy'd to claim  For her dear

grace to join  Thy skill express'd new shades of soft desire  Each varying character of Cupid's fire  In thy gay figure Bacchus smil'd to see  His gambols of tumultuary glee  Thy genius wrought by different powers inspir'd  As fondness wish'd or dignity requir'd  'Twas thine to decorate the gorgeous scene  Where Arts were proud to aid the Carian queen  Richly she rais'd for widow'd love's relief  The grand memorial of imperial grief  The Mausoleum whose immortal name  Records her sorrow and preserves her fame  Of feelings exquisite to fondness prone  And pleas'd to make peculiar praise thy own  Praxiteles the power that sway'd thee most  Made it thy joy thy privilege thy boast  To see coy Beauty own thy kind control  And show each soft emotion of her soul  While breathing stone accomplish'd thy behest  And every charm of tender grace express'd  Till thy fine Work such perfect life display'd  Venus with pride her marble self survey'd  Enchanting artist whose warm heart was seen  Devoting all thy skill to Beauty's queen  'Twas not thy fate to serve a thankless power  Her smile is gratitude delight her dower  Love her young darling thy dear Art caress'd  Child of thy genius sovereign of thy breast  Thy sportive patroness to thy embrace  Consign'd the fairest of her Grecian race  Whose wit to beauty could new charms impart  Pleas'd to inspirit and reward thy art  This playful fair would secret knowledge seek  Which her unboasting friend declin'd to speak  She wish'd to know a wish in vain express'd  Which of his happy works he deem'd the best  The best is hers if she the best will choose  But selfapplause his modest lips refuse  A subtle fiction aids her strong desire  "Praxiteles thy gallery's on fire"  With fear well feign'd the fond enthusiast cries  Quick in alarm the man of art replies  "Oh angry Vulcan mar each meaner shape  "But let my Cupid and my Faun escape"  The smiling fair relieves him in a trice  And Cupid soon her own repays the fond device  See NOTE VI    Of sterner spirit and with bold design  Toiling in two congenial arts to shine  With energetic truth Euphranor wrought  The forceful features of heroic thought  And ere the youth a vanquish'd world o'errun  In glory's car he seated Philip's son  See NOTE VII    Hail to that graceful youth whose fervid mind  Feeling and taste in early life refin'd  Who on the soul of cherish'd art impress'd  That zeal for glory which his own confess'd  Let the stern sage chastise with Reason's rod  Ambition's victim and Delirium's god  More pleasing duties to the bard belong  While tracing Sculpture's march in moral song  Honour's just tribute to the prince he pays  Who view'd her beauty with a lover's gaze  And nobly sav'd it from a quick decline  By liberal care and bounty's warmth benign  Who bade her favourite son his power surpass  And call to life in fameconferring brass  A work where Gratitude with glory blends  His guardian group his selfdevoted friends  Proud of the victor's praise and pleas'd to aid  A hero's spirit by affection sway'd  With such enchanting skill Lysippus' hand  Rais'd to distinction this devoted band  That as each Macedon their forms beheld  With kindred fire each martial bosom swell'd  Each for their lot would gladly yield his breath  And deem their honor cheaply bought by death  How blest Lysippus was thy signal fate  Whose genius found all graces in the great  Nature and Fortune seem'd for thee to blend  In one bright form the model patron friend  His taste enlighten'd whom his power sustain'd  And in the sculptor's heart the hero reign'd  Hence for thy godlike Ammon 'twas thy praise  Each varying semblance of his form to raise  Marking of changeful life the gradual course  From childhood's tenderness to manhood's force  And these appropriate images to fill  With such felicity of latent skill  As labour led by love alone can find  By love the offspring of a grateful mind  Ever Lysippus be thy name rever'd  By moral dignity of mind endear'd  Glory wellpleas'd thy double worth beheld  The matchless artist by the man excell'd  Thy upright spirit firm in manly sense  Scorning to favour impious Pride's pretence  Reprov'd thy friend Apelles that he strove  To lavish lightning on a fancied Jove  And to thy statue rationally grand  Gave the just weapon of a hero's hand  Thy taste ador'd with Virtue's temperate flame  Truth as the fountain both of art and fame  Yet no illfounded rule no servile fear  Chain'd thy free mind in Fancy's fav'rite sphere  Thy dauntless thought proportion for its guide  From life's trite field each brave excursion tried  Thy changeful genius patient and acute  Toil'd on colossal forms or play'd with the minute  And Nature own'd each work with fond surprize  True to her soul though faithless to her size  The hallow'd bulk of thy Tarentine Jove  Check'd the proud spoilers of each sacred grove  Roman rapacity in plunder's hour  Paus'd and rever'd the mighty sculptor's power  Thy Hercules the table's grace and guard  Rais'd to extatic joy a Roman bard  Whose social Muse delighted to rehearse  The festive statue's charms in friendly verse  Prais'd the small form where force and spirit dwelt  Small to be seen but mighty to be felt  And pleas'd in grateful numbers to relate  The sculptur'd powers Felicity and Fate  Told how young Ammon with affection's pride  Drew martial fire from this inspiring guide  This the choice idol of his life caress'd  To prompt his battle or protect his rest  To this when poison forc'd his frequent sighs  Turning in death his elevated eyes  He view'd the paintried power with fresh delight  And fed his fearless spirit on the sight  The life of Ammon clos'd the statue pass'd  To a new victor of a direr cast  With ruthless Hannibal by Rome abhorr'd  The priz'd associate of the Punic lord  This idol visited Italia's shore  And saw Rome's eagles drench'd in Roman gore  But when the African so fiercely great  Fell by the dark vicissitude of fate  This sculptur'd Hercules still known to Fame  As worshipp'd by a chief of highest name  Felt e'en in Rome his influence increas'd  As the presiding power of Sylla's feast  The darling image Time at last consign'd  To a new master of a nobler mind  Hail gentle Vindex 'twas not thine to buy  A name immortal at a price too high  No bloody sword with mangled Nature's pain  Carv'd thee a passage into glory's fane  But manners sweetly mild and mental grace  In Mem'ry's temple fix thy purer place  Thy genuine praise Affection gladly penn'd  For Arts were thy delight a poet was thy friend  Happy distinction and rever'd by Time  Sweet in its use in consequence sublime  Accomplish'd Vindex all thy sculptur'd store  Though Genius fill'd with life the finish'd ore  All that thy perfect taste by Fortune's aid  With liberal joy collected and display'd  All all in dark Perdition's gulph are drown'd  Nor can an atom of the wreck be found  But shining still and still in lustre strong  Such is the sacred power of friendly song  Thy virtues are beheld in living lays  Where feeling Statius thy pure feast pourtrays  And makes thy cherish'd Arts confederate in thy praise  He just to merit of benignant mein  Fondly describes the master of the scene  So free from senseless pride and sensual vice  Of mind so polish'd and of taste so nice  That under his regard true honour's test  Lysippus might have wish'd his works to rest  See NOTE VIII    To rest vain word that suits not scenes like these  Where empires fluctuate as Time decrees  The mighty despot of a double sway  The guide of growth the monarch of decay  Grants ever busy in the changeful plan  No lasting quiet to the works of man  Witness Lysippus that stupendous frame  Form'd by thy pupil for his country's fame  Who when foil'd War renounc'd her rich abodes  Rear'd the proud trophy of triumphant Rhodes  In giant splendour which the world amaz'd  Protentous in his bulk this proud Apollo blaz'd  So large so lotfy that beneath his base  Mortals seem'd shrunk below the pigmy race  Yet let not vain sensorious spleen deride  This Pagan monument of tow'ring pride  Great in his aim in patriot purpose good  A glorious witness the Colossus stood  How his brave isle in valour's trying hour  Joy'd to resist Invasion's ruffian power  Still to invading arms this fortune fall  To deck those isles they threaten to enthrall  But with what speed can time and chance destroy  The piles of honour and the pomp of joy  Though rear'd with ablest art that might defy  Tempestuous seasons and a raging sky  Subtler Destruction waits the sovereign block  The deep foundations of his island rock  Earth as insulted to her center shakes  Th' enormous idol reelshe fallshe breaks  Amazement's eye his smallest fragments fill  In ruin mighty and a wonder still  His fall is felt through Glory's wounded heart  And Grief's convulsionshakes the sphere of Art  See NOTE IX    Ye Rhodians early a distinguish'd race  For arts and arms Minerva's double grace  Ye who around this shatter'd mass lament  Your honour ruin'd in the dire event  Mourn not your fall'n Colossus but complain  Of change more ruinous to Sculpture's reign  Mourn for degenerate Athens where the king  From whose foil'd arms your statue seem'd to spring  No more resisted finds a servile crowd  Tam'd to his yoke and in his praises loud  Where Art is seen in Prostitution's hour  Dejecting virtue and exalting power  Ye slaves who station blind to public good  A tyrant's statues where a sage's stood  Ye prove the love of liberty alone  Enlivens Art with lustre all its own  Where that best passion of the soul refin'd  That firm Colossus of th' unshaken mind  Where that exists no more all mental power  Takes the cold tint of twilight's sunless hour  The energies of Art and Virtue cease  Servility benumbs the soul of Greece  See NOTE X    That wondrous land where Nature seem'd to shower  A bright profusion of all mental power  Where talents glitter'd to delight the mind  Rich as the groves by silv'ry frost enshrin'd  From her spoil'd shores saw every grace withdraw  Like groves unsilver'd in a misty thaw  While Strife and Slavery in union base  Disfigure earth and Nature's self deface  The tender Arts in hasty terror fly  To seek a refuge in a milder sky  Driv'n from their darling Athens for a while  They seem'd reviving by a monarch's smile  Seleucias' Court the fugitives caress'd  And Aegypt nurs'd them on her fertile breast  But not the Ptolemies' imperial grace  A bounteous splendid but enervate race  Not all their fond protection could impart  True Attic lustrè to transplanted Art  The sweet exotic scorn'd the soil it tried  And faintly promising to flourish died  See NOTE XI    Genius of Greece whom love can ne'er forget  Exhaustless source of rapture and regret  Of all the changes that Time's wild command  Works on this globe the rattle of his hand  Is there vicissitude more worthy tears  Than what in thy disastrous fate appears  When Learning's retrospective eyes survey  Thy bright ascendant and thy dark decay  Resistless despot allcontrolling Time  Though Pride may curse thy ravage as a crime  Let Truth more just thy milder power declare  And boast with gratitude thy zeal to spare  For thou hast spar'dand be such mercy blest  Of Grecia's literary chiefs the best  The pure Triumvirate of potent minds  Whom in her zone ideal Beauty binds  The radiant three who palms unrivall'd bore  In verse in eloquence in moral lore  Yes in the letter'd world that lofty sphere  Whence light descends to Art divinely clear  Great is thy clemency O Time nor less  Thy zeal to save may Sculpture's field express  See NOTE XII    Man's rage has given to Havoc's hateful powers  Gods and their altars statues temples towers  But mark where Time with more benignant pride  Redeems the wreck of desolation's tide  Lo at his bidding curious hands explore  Imperial Ruin's subterranean store  Behold where once a virtuous emp'ror glow'd  And thy rich bath benignant Titus flow'd  For ages buried and Oblivion's prey  The masterpiece of Sculpture springs to day  How Rapture bends o'er the receding earth  Blessing the skilful wonder's second birth  Hail thou sublime resemblance of the sire  Excruciated to see his helpless sons expire  Though Fate's fierce serpent round thy manly frame  Wind its vast volumes and with deadly aim  Dart its impetuous poison near the heart  Though thy shrunk flank announce the wounded part  To selfish pangs superior thou art seen  And suffering anguish more intensely keen  I see the father in thy features rise  To Heaven directing his deathdarken'd eyes  And for his sons in agony's extreme  Yet asking mercy from the sire supreme  Alas thy younger hope already pierc'd  By quick Perdition's snake expires the first  Thy elder darling lock'd in snaky folds  With fruitless pity his rack'd sire beholds  Ye happy Sculptors who in this your pride  Enjoy th' immortal fame for which you sigh'd  Your blest ambition Ruin's hand disarms  Hostility reveres the work whose charms  At once amaze the mind and melt the heart  The soul of pathos the sublime of Art  Let Rhodes exulting in your birth proclaim  Her title to renown her Agesander's name  Him if kind Fancy sanction with applause  The pleasing picture that conjecture draws  Him life's best blessings once were seen to crown  Blessings more rare than genius or renown  The bliss to see two sons in art aspire  To serve as friendly rivals to their sire  The triple group so suited to their state  They form'd with parity of love elate  And Nature pleas'd gave all her powers to fill  This richest offspring of confederate skill  See NOTE XIII    Nor hast thou Sculpture on whose ancient state  The train of passions all were known to wait  Thy deep and spiritsearching charms confin'd  To show the conflict of a father's mind  Thy Niobe yet lives a glorious test  Thou could'st exhibit the maternal breast  Where gods relentless every pang descried  Of wretched beauty and of ruin'd pride  See NOTE XIV    Yes Attic Art each change of vital breath  Of life the fervour and the chill of death  All all were subject to thy glorious power  Nature was thine in evervarying hour  Witness that offspring of thy skill profound  Thy Gladiator bending to the ground  In whom the eye of sympathy descries  His brief existence ebbing as he lies  See NOTE XV  With rising wonder and increasing joy  As Grecian reliques my fond thoughts employ  Her timespar'd marble miracles I trace  Marbles of highest note strength beauty grace  In each Olympian form divinely shown  Who boast these heavenly attributes their own  On Glycon's Hercules the proud eye rests  Dwells on that force which all the form invests  Till the spectator glows with vigor's flame  And feels the god reanimate his frame  See NOTE XVI    In perfect forms what potent magic dwells  Thy peerless fragment of perfection tells  Skill'd Apolonius whose fine work express'd  This forceful deity in blissful rest  How dear thy Torso to the feeling mind  Rememb'ring Angelo when old and blind  Fed on this wreck the passion of his heart  For the recondite charms of purest art  The veteran while his hand with science fraught  Rov'd o'er the stone so exquisitely wrought  His fancy giving the maim'd trunk a soul  Saw in his touch the grandeur of the whole  See NOTE XVII    Joys on the swelling mind more richly shower  When beauty's manly and majestic power  Shines sweetly awful in Apollo's form  Elate with filial love with anger warm  Against the serpent whose terrific crest  Aim'd its base fury at his mother's breast  His shaft is launch'd 'tis empire's fateful rod  His fervid gesture proves the victor god  His glowing features the firm soul display  Of confident success and righteous sway  Enchanting image thy pure charms conduce  To moral lessons of no trifling use  Thee while the fascinated eyes admire  The spirit kindling with indignant fire  Learns that bright scorn which in thy movement glows  Scorn for the rancour of malignant foes  See NOTE XVIII    In milder tones kind Harmony impart  Thy magic softness to the melting heart  While Love's ingenuous song aspires to trace  The sweeter influence of female grace  Hail Medicean Venus matchless form  As Nature modest yet as Fancy warm  Thy beauty mov'd by virtuous instinct tries  To screen retiring charms from rash surprise  Thy hands are eloquent they both attest  The coy emotion of thy feeling breast  And prove by delicacy's dear control  Her quick sensations are of grace the soul  Thou darling idol of the Pagan earth  Whose pomp had vanish'd at thy second birth  When from Oblivion's shades that o'er thee hung  Thy soft attractions to new honour sprung  To thee sweet pride of Nature and of Art  Be endless homage from the manly heart  Which bends obedient to a law divine  In guiltless worship to such charms as thine  Though mortals wayward when by Fortune cross'd  Slight what they have in mourning what they lost  Let us dear Flaxman with a grateful joy  On Sculpture's rescu'd wealth our thoughts employ  O while with Friendship's pure though proud desires  I praise that Art who thy free spirit fires  May thy pleas'd goddess with her kind regard  Support instruct invigorate thy bard  Till my fond fancy by her aid refin'd  Fills with new zeal thy energetic mind  Yet far above her living sons to soar  And match the wonders of her Attic store  Yes there is room and Christian subjects yield  For Art's sublimest aims a happier field  But pause my eager song nor yet rehearse  A fav'rite truth reserv'd for future verse  See NOTE XIX    Another task awaits thee to survey  Scenes of Etrurian art and Roman sway  Yet pause and listening to the wintry main  In this retreat let Meditation reign  Here salutary Solitude repairs  The spirit wasted by afflicting cares  Here rest while Study for thy use explores  Art's early fate on those eventful shores  Where hardly rescu'd from Oblivion's tomb  Polish'd Etruria sunk by savage Rome  And Rome whose pride an iron tempest hurl'd  With force oppressive round a prostrate world  Sunk in her turn herself the bloated prey  Of Retribution's wrath in ruinous decay  THE END OF THE THIRD EPISTLE  EPISTLE THE FOURTH  Inter fumantes templorum armata ruinas

victor's nod  For her new temple form'd the guardian god  Her patrons destin'd to such wide command  Arose the offspring of a Tuscan hand  Ye injur'd votaries of Art whose skill  Emerg'd from darkness and emerging still  Shines through Oppression's storm whose envious sweep  Had sunk your language in her lawless deep  Expert Etrurians who with rapid toil  Form'd the fine vase Oblivion's power to foil  Your bards to base annihilation doom'd  History who spurn'd the grave herself entomb'd  Friendly conjecture can alone suggest  How Fortune on your coast young Art caress'd  'Tis said that Aegypt was your early guide  That Greece more social all your skill supplied  The fond idolaters of Greece pretend  But bounteous Nature was your leading friend  She frankly gave you the prime source of skill  The fervid spirit and the lively will  To call Invention from her coy recess  And bid just Form the young idea dress  Let different Arts with gen'rous pride proclaim  Inventive Genius form'd Etruria's fame  Mars as a gift from her his trumpet found  And Honour's heart exulted in the sound  To her e'en Athens as the learn'd declare  Might owe the mask dramatic Muses wear  See NOTE I    But O Etruria whatsoe'er the price  Of thy ingenious toil and rare device  Of all thy produce I applaud thee most  For thy mild Lares thy peculiar boast  'Twas thine in Sculpture's sacred scene to place  Domestic deities of social grace  Whose happy favour on the heart impress'd  Made home the passion of the virtuous breast  See NOTE II    O that fond Labour's hand with Learning's aid  Could rescue from Oblivion's envious shade  Artists defrauded of their deathless due  Who once a glory round Etruria threw  When with her flag of transient fame unfurl'd  She shone the wonder of the western world  Eclipsing Greece ere rais'd to nobler life  Greece learnt to triumph o'er barbaric strife  Driving her Argonauts her naval boast  Foil'd in sharp conflict from the Tyrrhene coast  See NOTE III    But Desolation in her cruel course  Rush'd o'er Etruria with such ruthless force  That of her artdevoted sons whose skill  With sculptur'd treasures could her cities fill  In such profuse and luminous display  That Roman avarice mark'd them for her prey  Mem'ry can hardly on her tablets give  More than a single Tyrrhene name to live  Mnesarchus early as a sculptor known  From nice incision of the costly stone  But more endear'd to every later age  As the blest sire of that abstemious sage  Who born and nurtur'd on Etruria's shore  Refin'd her spirit by his temp'rate lore  And in Crotona gloried to display  His mild morality's benignant sway  See NOTE IV    Blest were Etrurian art if spar'd by Time  Forth from the caverns of her ravag'd clime  She could present to Admiration's gaze  Each sculptur'd worthy of her prosperous days  Who won by labours of a virtuous mind  The benedictions of improv'd mankind  But one vast whirlpool of oblivious night  Absorb'd together in fair Fame's despite  Men who there rose the paths of fame to fill  Her hosts of valour and her tribes of skill  All who might hope to gain or hope to give  The noblelot through many an age to live  Save a few reliques fondly kept to deck  The cabinet of Taste from Glory's wreck  There shines not destitute of martial grace  Her brave Halesus of Argolic race  See NOTE V    There every brazen every marble frame  Mute mournful shadows of Etruria's fame  Yet seen declaring on their country's part  She might have vied with Attica in art  Had she not fallen in her early bloom  The stripp'd and mangled slave of barbarous Rome  Yes thou imperial spoiler I abhor  Thy ceaseless passion for oppressive war  Thy rage for rapine and the pride malign  In the vast plunder of the world to shine  Woe to the land abjuring Arts refin'd  That ask the patient hand the polish'd mind  And vaunting only with tyrannic sway  To make surrounding provinces their prey  Rapacious arrogance for outrage strong  May boast a cruel triumph loud and long  At last the coarse gigantic glutton dies  O'ergorg'd and sinking from his bloated size  So sunk the spoiler Rome who from her birth  Drew execration from the bleeding earth  Too fierce for Arts that claim a milder soul  Their works she blindly prais'd or basely stole  See NOTE VI    Fast bound or silenc'd in her iron spell  Her illstarr'd neighbour first Etruria fell  Far as her force increas'd her rapine spread  Beneath her grasp the sweet Sicilia bled  And amply deck'd with Beauty's sculptur'd charms  Fair Syracuse was spoil'd by savage arms  There Roman avarice of ruthless heart  First gloated on her prey of Grecian Art  And like a bloodhound on the taste of gore  Hunted with fierce inquietude for more  See NOTE VII    Her wider ravages Achaia crown'd  The richest feast her ravenous eagles found  Lo Corinth blazes in consuming flame  Corinth the splendid favourite of Fame  Her shrines her statues brazen silver gold  In one promiscuous conflagration roll'd  To a vast furnace of perdition turn  The mingled ores in fiery torrents burn  And Havoc's hateful sons in sportive rage  Annihilate the toil of many an age  The treasury of Sculpture where she stor'd  Those wonders of her hand that Taste ador'd  See NOTE VIII    The savage victor would his triumph fill  By bearing proudly home some works of skill  But destitute of sense as blind to grace  Deems that a common hand may soon replace  Works that in Talent's cultivated hours  Rose the slow growth of rarest Grecian powers  Insensate ravager why deck thy land  With spoils thy heroes cannot understand  See NOTE IX    Thy country who a stranger to remorse  Trains all her sons to deeds of brutal force  She ne'er the sweet and graceful pride shall know  That taught the heart of lovelier Greece to glow  When she had rear'd and hail'd with fond acclaim  The liberal artist of accomplish'd fame  On Rome's stern breast no Phidias can be bred  Of whom his proud compatriots fondly said  'Twas a misfortune as Athenians thought  To die and not have seen the works he wrought  See NOTE X    Greece wisely conscious that fine arts require  Such pensive energy such mental fire  As Honour asks in every polish'd age  To form the martial chief or moral sage  Cherish'd her artists with maternal pride  And bright Distinction their rich power supplied  Her sculptors bask'd in national esteem  As the young eagle in the solar beam  Rever'd as men whose faculties sublime  Secur'd their country's fame from envious Time  Who doubly foil'd the darkness of the grave  And shar'd the immortality they gave  See NOTE XI    How different the Roman sculptor's fate  Who follow'd in a tame and abject state  An art not rais'd to glory or to grace  Deem'd the poor trade of a dependent race  The chissel to a servile hand consign'd  Shews but the weakness of a servile mind  Hence liberal Sculpture rais'd no Roman name  High in her annals of ingenious fame  And hence the Goddess with a scornful smile  Spurns the distinction of her Roman style  See NOTE XII    With just disdain that to abhorrence swell'd  She the base arrogance of Rome beheld  Saw Roman robbers of heroic size  Not merely seize as bold Ambition's prize  Her dearest wealth in desolated Greece  But as presumption will with spoils increase  From her Greek statue its just name efface  And fix a lying title in its place  So ruffian Pride that Fortune deigns to crown  Would with a swindler's fraud usurp renown  While dauntless Truth undazzled by the blaze  Of Rome's fierce power in her despotic days  Upbraids that Empress with reproof severe  For follies and for crimes in Sculpture's sphere  While Scorn condemns her rapine and her fraud  With equal warmth let Justice still applaud  One proof of noble spirit that prevail'd  E'en in this very sphere where most she fail'd  Yes it was spirit suited to such worth  As well might claim preeminence on earth  Which in the walls he labour'd to o'erthrow  Honour'd the statue of her fiercest foe  Such brave regard the soldier's brightest crown  Rome nobly paid to Hannibal's renown  And more sublime of soul she ne'er appear'd  Than when she grac'd the chief whom once she fear'd  True Valour thus his genuine temper shews  Just to the talents of accomplish'd foes  See NOTE XIII    Bright Excellence 'tis thine in evil days  To joy in Enmity's extorted praise  So Grecian Art her parent state undone  From Roman pride reluctant homage won  Rough was his worship paid to Sculpture's charms  That injur'd beauty in a ruffian's arms  Who view'd her grace with uninstructed eyes  Proud to possess though wanting taste to prize  Gods how regret and indignation glow  When History mourning over Grecian woe  Describes the fortune of each splendid fane  Where Sculpture seem'd with sacred sway to reign  Lo like a whirlwind by fierce demons driven  At once disfiguring earth and dark'ning Heaven  Sylla the bloodiest vulture gorg'd with gore  The keenest wretch that ever Rapine bore  Extends o'er prostrate Greece oppression's rod  And pillages the shrine of every god  Thy glories ElisEpidaurus thine  And Delphos richest treasury divine  Defenceless fall in Devastation's day  Of this insatiate ravager the prey  The plunderer who no compunction feels  Builds future greatness on the god he steals  With a small statue seiz'd on Grecia's coast  The subtle homicide newnerv'd his host  When on the battle's edge they doubtful stood  This god he brought to make his battle good  Before his troops the fraudful savage press'd  This sculptur'd patron to his impious breast  Invok'd to hasten what his vows implor'd  The vict'ry promis'd to his eager sword  So fraud and force and fortune made him great  To shine an emblem of the Roman state  Her he resembled in his varying day  In growth portentous loathsome in decay  He whose fierce pride all human feelings fled  On blood the hellhounds of Proscription fed  Met not a righteous sword or potent hand  To free from such a pest his native land  Yet though he stemm'd the streams of blood he spilt  He died a lesson to gigantic guilt  For on his bed of death as long he lay  Avenging vermin made his living frame their prey  And he whose thirst of power and thirst of praise  Taught Fortune's temple in new pomp to blaze  He who amass'd to deck his days of peace  The sculptur'd opulence of ravag'd Greece  Sunk from his splendid mass of power and fame  To the poor sound of a detested name  See NOTE XIV    A mightier victor of a nobler soul  Yet darken'd by ambition's dire control  The fearless Caesar of indulgent heart  Shone the protecting friend of Grecian art  Of tyrants most accomplish'd and benign  'Twas his in genius and in taste to shine  Could talents give a claim to empire's robe  He might have liv'd the master of the globe  But pride imperious that o'erleap'd all bound  Deserv'd from Roman hands the fate he found  Yet shall the despot though he justly bleeds  Receive the praises due to graceful deeds  His rival's statues by mean slaves disgrac'd  He in their public dignity replac'd  His zeal for Sculpture and his liberal care  To force the grave her buried works to spare  To guard the rescu'd and the lost to seek  Let Corinth rising from her ruins speak  That brilliant queen of Arts at Caesar's word  Sprung from her ashes like th' Arabian bird  Her great restorer fond of glory's blaze  Sought to be first in every path of praise  And found in favour'd Art's reviving charms  Delight superior to successful arms  Had the firm Brutus not pronounc'd his doom  His power to fascinate relenting Rome  His varying genius fashion'd to prevail  In peaceful projects of the grandest scale  Would o'er the state have thrown such dazzling light  And foil'd resistance with a blaze so bright  Freedom herself enamour'd of his fame  Might have been almost tempted to exclaim  "I see his benefits his wrongs transcend  "And all the tyrant vanish in the friend"  Julius thou proof how mists of pride may blind  The eye of reason in the strongest mind  It was thy fatal weakness to believe  Thy sculptur'd form from Romans might receive  Homage as tame as Asian slaves could pay  Their Babylonish king of boundless sway  Where all for leave his city gate to pass  Bent to his statue of imperial brass  With equal pomp by vain ambition plac'd  Thy sculptur'd form the Capitol disgrac'd  For on a trampled globe insulting sense  It sought to awe the world with proud pretence  Nor didst thou only in thy proper frame  Call Art to second thy aspiring aim  Thy fav'rite steed from whose portentous birth  Augurs announc'd thy reign o'er all this earth  Nurs'd with fond care bestrid by thee alone  In Sculpture's consecrated beauty shone  Before the fane of that celestial power  Said with parental smiles to bless thy natal hour  See NOTE XV    Misguided Julius all the wide control  Which force and frankness in thy fearless soul  To thy firm grasp delusively assur'd  Consummate cunning to thy heir secur'd  Blush blush ye poets of Augustan days  For all your pomp of prostituted praise  The man so magnified through Flatt'ry's cloud  Hymns to whose honour ye have sung so loud  Seems to the eye of an impartial age  The prince of jugglers upon Fortune's stage  Whom fear inspir'd with artifice supreme  To win from slaves their prodigal esteem  Ye lovely Arts whose beauty and whose use  So largely to the weal of man conduce  What might not Earth in your propitious hours  Expect from efforts of your blended powers  Beneath the guidance of a mind elate  Supremely just and uniformly great  If base Octavius by your aid could shine  To dazzle Romans with a light divine  Peace to his crimes though on their blackest dye  The blood of Tully seems aloud to cry  While foster'd Arts for their protector claim  No common portion of pacific fame  He saw the rock on which bold Julius run  And deeply labour'd the bright snare to shun  The subtle despot wore a servant's mask  Though able to command he stoop'd to ask  The eyes of envy from himself to turn  Thy splendour Rome appear'd his sole concern  Though fear devis'd it was a graceful plan  And Taste achiev'd what trembling Power began  To bid fair Sculpture a new pomp assume  And sit the public patroness of Rome  For such great charge to her he seem'd to give  When the lost worthies she had taught to live  Whose blended merits in the tide of Time  Rais'd Romanglory to her height sublime  Rang'd in his Forum with Augustan care  Heard him before the hallow'd groupe declare  They stood as monitors of solemn weight  To him and all who might direct the state  At once a sacred test and awful guide  By whom he wish'd his conduct to be tried  O lovely Sculpture what sweet praise were thine  If strictly true to such a fair design  Presiding power in every realm on earth  Call'd thee to minister to public worth  To worth of milder and of purer ray  Than Rome's rapacious demigods display  Though seated there in empire's strongest blaze  The shrewd Octavius aim'd at Ammon's praise  His milder praise to shine in taste supreme  And heighten talents by protection's beam  Bless'd in what Ammon wanted bards renown'd  Sculpture more coy than Poesy he found  Nor could the mandate of imperial sway  Raise a Lysippus out of Roman clay  And Fortune's fav'rite in the naval scene  Where sunk the glory of the Aegyptian queen  Though sculptur'd emblems of that prosp'rous hour  Speak him the darling of despotic power  Has still the fate in feeble pomp to stand  The timespar'd statue of no potent hand  Wrought as if Sculpture felt her powers confin'd  By native meanness in the monarch's mind  See NOTE XVI    Yet many a wandering ingenious Greek  Sent by his stars his Roman bread to seek  Nourish'd degenerate pride on foreign praise  And blest the sunshine of Augustan days  One whose fine labour on the costly stone  Greece in her happiest days might proudly own  Her Dioscorides by Patience taught  Minute resemblance on the gem he wrought  And form'd with Miniature's consummate grace  Power's fav'rite signet the imperial face  See NOTE XVII    Nor shall his rival in the curious skill  Nice Diminution's lines with truth to fill  The sculptor Solon want the Muse's praise  Since on his work the Nine may fondly gaze  For his the portrait of prime note to them  Their own Maecenas their peculiar gem  See NOTE XVIII    As Nature joying in her boundless reign  Adorns the tiny links of Beauty's lessening chain  Her rival Art whom Emulation warms  Loves to astonish by diminish'd forms  And the consummate character to bring  Within the compass of the costly ring  Delightful talent of the patient hand  Gaining o'er life such delicate command  The heroes of old time were proud to wear  The seal engraven with ingenious care  And wise Ulysses if tradition's true  No trifling pleasure from his signet drew  A dolphin's form the sculptur'd stone express'd  Of gracious Providence a graceful test  Sav'd from the deep these wat'ry guardians bore  His filial pride Telemachus ashore  And the fond sire display'd with grateful joy  The just memorial of his rescu'd boy  See NOTE XIX    To this fine branch of useful Art we owe  Treasures that grandeur may be proud to show  Features of men who on Fame's list enroll'd  Gave life and lustre to the world of old  Oblivion's pall a net of Mercy's shape  Has seiz'd the large and let the small escape  Worthies whose statues fail'd Time's flood to stem  Yet live effulgent in the deathless gem  But O how few can merit such a fate  Where Nature sinks by Power's despotic weight  When the proud player Augustus worn with age  Made a calm exit from his brilliant stage  In that vast theatre what scenes ensu'd  What beasts of Tyranny's imperial brood  Sculpture in days of turpitude profuse  Of her sunkpowers deplor'd the shameful use  When statues rose to wound the public eye  To the base sycophant and murd'rous spy  Nor mourn'd she less distinction illconferr'd  On many a wretch of her Caesarean herd  Most on the base Caligula who burn'd  With frantic folly that all limits spurn'd  His life express'd in every wild design  Delirious fancy with a heart malign  And most display'd that fancy and that heart  In the fair province of insulted Art  Oft o'er her Grecian works griev'd Sculpture sigh'd  Made the maim'd vassals of his impious pride  See NOTE XX    He dies but still the burthen'd earth must groan  For guilt gigantic on th' imperial throne  And Sculpture's call'd as waiting on the nod  Of Grandeur wishing to be deem'd a god  To her Greek votary she denied the skill  Requir'd to execute vain Nero's will  Who sought all splendor that could strike mankind  Save the pure splendor of the chasten'd mind  Who marr'd the statues of Perfection's mould  Thy bronze Lysippus with debasing gold  The daring despot wish'd with frantic aim  To awe the world by his colossal frame  Vainly he bade his molten image run  With metals to outblaze the Rhodian sun  His toiling Greek though fam'd for works of brass  Fail'd in his art to form the fluid mass  See NOTE XXI    But turn indignant Muse thine eyes away  From the mad monsters of unbridled sway  To mark with just applause the milder mind  Whom boundless domination fail'd to blind  Whose voice imperial bade the Arts appear  The friends of bounty not the slaves of fear  Frugal and gay behold Vespasian's care  Honour and Virtue's ruin'd fanes repair  To statues meant for Nero's golden dome  Peace in her temple gives a purer home  See NOTE XXII    Titus the pride of Nature and her friend  Could thy brief reign to happier length extend  How might the warmth of thy benignant heart  Raise and inspirit every graceful art  Sculpture might well her finest toil employ  To fill thy bosom with parental joy  Fancy e'en now exults to see thee gaze  On thy rich gem beyond the diamond's blaze  Where by Evodus wrought in narrow space  Shone thy fair Julia full of filial grace  Beauty and sweetness deck'd her maiden life  But ah no common shame awaits the wife  And Heaven mild Titus made thy days so brief  To spare thee torments of domestic grief  See NOTE XXIII    Thy brother's statues in thier fate fulfill'd  The rabble's vengeance on a tyrant kill'd  See NOTE XXIV    In radiant contrast to that wretch ascend  Trajan the graceful Pliny's martial friend  Justly 'tis thine to stand an honour'd name  On thy rich column of imperial fame  Through thy vast empire in which vice had spread  The worst contagion springing from its head  Thy active spirit gloried to inspire  A noble portion of new vital fire  Though fond too fond of war and warlike praise  Pacific talents shar'd thy fost'ring rays  Not that thy hand proud Victory's flag unfurl'd  And added Dacia to the Roman world  But for mild acts that purer aims evince  Shall memory prize thy name excelling prince  Thy softer merit that commands my praise  Was thy fond care with regal grace to raise  Statues to youthful virtue in its prime  Unseasonably crush'd by envious Time  Thy gift imperial to a noble chief  The filial statue sooth'd a father's grief  With the true temper of a sovereign mind  Tenderly just magnificently kind  See NOTE XXV    Thee too with sovereigns not unjustly plac'd  For bright magnificence and liberal taste  Whose hand welljudging Fortune deign'd to use  O'er Grecian scenes new lustre to diffuse  Smiling to see from Wealth's mysterious springs  Her private favourite surpassing kings  Thee rich Herodes Honour has enroll'd  For elegance of mind that match'd thy gold  Exhausted quarries form thy graceful piles  Thy Venus prais'd thee with victorious smiles  See NOTE

all the splendor that endears the day  Of cherish'd talents and pacific sway  Aiming by lib'ral patronage to crown  Athens Art's fav'rite seat with new renown  In her consummated Olympian fane  He taught sublime magnificence to reign  Where in rich scenes beneath unclouded skies  He bids his own Italian villa rise  Th' imperial structures with such charms increase  They form a fair epitome of Greece  There all her temples theatres and towers  Fabrics for studious and for active hours  All that made Attica the eye's delight  In sweet reflection reinchant the sight  O Desolation thou hast ne'er defac'd  More graceful precincts of imperial Taste  But with a ravage by no charms controll'd  O'er the proud spot thy ruthless flood has roll'd  Still from thy vortex by the tide of Time  Its buried treasures rise to deck some distant clime  As o'er this fairest scene of scenes august  Whose pride has moulder'd into shapeless dust  My fancy mus'd a vision of the night  Brought it in recent splendor to my sight  Its shrines its statues its Lyceum caught  My wond'ring eye and fix'd my roving thought  Beneath the shadow of a laurel bough  With all the cares of empire on his brow  I saw the master of the villa rove  In shades that seem'd the academic grove  Sudden a form array'd in softest light  Benignly simple temperately bright  Yet more than mortal in the quiet vale  Appear'd the pensive emperor to hail  Sculpture's insignia and her graceful mein  Announc'd of finer Arts the modest queen  Troubled yet mild in gesture and in tone  She made the troubles of her spirit known  "O thou" she said "that in thy sovereign plan  "Art often more and often less than man  "Whom as my just though strange emotions rise  "I love admire and pity and despise  "While to vain heights thy blind ambition towers  "Thou hast ennobled and debas'd my powers  "As far as fame and infamy can stretch  "To deck the world and deify a wretch  "I come th' Almighty Spirit to obey  "For Arts are

semblance of a city large and new  Where pomp imperial seem'd employ'd to place  Sculpture's prime labours on a lasting base  There Samian Juno and Olympian Jove  The rarest treasures of each holy grove  The pride of ransack'd Asia Greece and Rome  There in new scenes new dignity assume  The startled master of the Roman throne  Exclaim'd in envy's quick indignant tone  "What mean these pageants that my eyes explore  "They seem to sparkle on Byzantium's shore  The lovely raiser of the vision cried  "Thou see'st a second Rome in Roman pride  "But turn and see what miseries await  "The pomp that wakes thy envy Mark its fate"  He turn'd but O what language can disclose  The changing scene's accumulated woes  Barbaric outrage rapine sword and fire  Convert it to a vast funereal pyre  Supreme in height colossal Phoebus burns  The Phydian brass to fluid lava turns  And lo yet dearer to poetic eyes  The living bronze of highwrought Homer dies  The sculptur'd pride of every clime and age  The guardian god the hero and the sage  All in promiscuous devastation fall  And Time selfstyl'd the conqueror of all  Time the proud offspring of Lysippus' hand  Adorn'd with emblems of his wide

And Gratitude and Glory bless'd her aid  See NOTE IV    Nor was it thine enchanting Art alone  With public virtue to inspirit stone  Diffusing by the praise thy forms express'd  Heroic ardour through a people's breast  'Twas thine for loftier minds above the croud  With gifts of rare preeminence endow'd  To counteract the ills that base mankind  To envied Genius have too oft assign'd  When Thebes induc'd her Pindar to condemn  By abject anger and malignant phlegm  Fin'd her free bard for daring to rehearse  The praise of Athens in his lib'ral verse  Kind Sculpture then his Attic friend arose  And well aveng'd him of ungen'rous foes  Pleas'd her just tribute to the bard to give  She taught his figure like his verse to live  Athens of finer Arts the bounteous queen  Display'd his statue in her public scene  Seated in regal state the crown the lyre  Announc'd the sov'reign of the lyric quire  Greece who with all a mother's transport found  Envy's base cry in Honour's plaudit drown'd  Smil'd on the splendid palm the poet won  And fondly hail'd her glorygiving son  Whose Muse rich nectar to the mind conveys  Poignant and sweetMorality and Praise  See NOTE V    Fair and benignant as his fervid Muse  Sculpture like her a radiant path pursues  Pleas'd to enlarge the province of renown  And add new lustre to th' Olympic crown  To him whom Pisa's public voice proclaims  As thrice a victor in her hallow'd games  The statue rais'd beneath the guard of Jove  Shines a bright inmate of the sacred grove  Thou fascinating scene of Arts combin'd  Where fost'ring Glory rear'd the Grecian mind  Oft as to thee the glance of Memory turns  The spirit kindles and the bosom burns  Enchanting Altis whose domain to fill  Elaborate Sculpture lavish'd all her skill  Pure was the pleasure thou wert form'd to raise  Where emulation grew by honour's blaze  While triumph flush'd the happy victor's cheek  Each heart exulted in the name of Greek  Intestine feuds by Glory taught to cease  One soul inspir'd the mingled states of Greece  And public virtue felt her ardour rise  From the sweet impulse of fraternal ties  Olympia hadst thou well that spirit nurs'd  Which made thee long of splendid scenes the first  Had it been thine to cherish and impart  Vigour of form and dignity of heart  Pure and unmix'd like true heroic worth  With all the abject vice of meaner earth  No barb'rous foes had made thy triumph cease  No savage Roman had disfigur'd Greece  Nor Ammon said deriding when he found  Thy sculptur'd victors in Miletus crown'd  "Where were these bodies of gigantic powers  "When the barbarian force o'erthrew your towers  See NOTE VI    But games of honour in effect benign  With morals flourish and with them decline  Through hallow'd walls where Excellence is nurs'd  Intruding Envy rarely fails to burst  Envy whose touch corrodes as rust on steel  Both private happiness and public weal  Envy was early an Olympian pest  Thy mangled image may this truth attest  Thiagenes enrich'd with rare renown  For many a contest and each varied crown  Some abject rival with resentment base  In secret dar'd thy statue to deface  The sculptur'd form as conscious of the blow  Fell with avenging weight and crush'd thy foe  Of Envy's sordid race so perish'd one  Her single nameless despicable son  See NOTE VII    But Envy apt for ever to increase  Prov'd most prolific in the realms of Greece  Hence her free states by jealous jars destroy'd  Left in the polish'd world a mournful void  Corporeal strength and intellectual power  Shone lovely Greece supremely as thy dower  But cordial union the best fruit of sense  The life the soul of national defence  Spirit that leads the weak to foil the strong  When every bosom burns for public wrong  This spirit thy vain sons no more the same  Fail'd to preserve as they advanc'd in fame  Her snares around them thus Oppression threw  Taught by their feuds to sep'rate and subdue  If Greece herself her real strength had known  Greece might have foil'd the hostile world alone  In war's wild tempest an unshaken tower  Peerless in arts and paramount in power  Too late to save yet potent to suspend  The storm of ruin hastening to descend  Sicyon thy free conciliating chief  Thy firm Aratus planning wise relief  Reclaim'd the bickering Greeks by union's charm  Bade jarring states with social prowess arm  And ere she sunk Oppression's helpless thrall  Of Greece protracted and adorn'd the fall  Just to his merit Sculpture's grateful hand  With grace heroic gave his form to stand  In lib'ral Corinth she the statue rear'd  And as a guardian power this patriot chief rever'd  See NOTE VIII    If e'er Greek Art with Glory for her guide  The highsoul'd portrait form'd with fonder pride  Perchance 'twas when a

ideas in the public mind  Enlighten'd Pagan whose bright works display  A cheering dawn before the Christian day  Where the calm grove of Academus grew  Thy sculptur'd form a signal lustre threw  Rais'd by a foreign prince whose lib'ral heart  To Grecian intellect and Grecian art  Paid this pure tribute proud in thee to own  The friend who taught him virtue's noblest tone  See NOTE IX    Ye sages who aloof from martial strife  Pursu'd the purer charms of pensive life  How oft has Sculpture joy'd with moral aim  To multiply your forms and spread your name  By Aesop's statue Greece this lesson gave  See NOTE X    Fame's path is open even to a slave  And Socrates ordain'd in bronze to stand  The honour'd labour of Lysippus' hand  Inform'd the world although an injur'd sage  Had

celestial day  In scenes where Meditation lov'd to dwell  The public portico or private cell  Has many a pensive philosophic bust  Repress'd the giddy or confirm'd the just  And kept frail Virtue on her mental throne  By the mild lesson of the speaking stone  Nor breath'd Instruction in her marble scene  Confin'd to stronger Man's expressive mein  The female statue gloried to inspire  Maternal

sweet power whose moral care express'd  The dearest feelings of the human breast  In early days before the martial throng  Of Grecian heroes arm'd for Helen's wrong  'Twas thine to shew in Beauty's

in his paternal care  Loth to resign the darling of his sight  A peerless daughter and his heart's delight  Heroic duties bade the prudent chief  Decline the favour to the father's grief  Who justly feeling what forbade their stay  Led his lov'd children on their distant way  'Tis time to partbut the too tender sire  Summons in vain his courage to retire  Nature subdues him and the lovely bride  Clings in mute anguish to her father's side  The noble Ithacus of manly soul  Viewing with pity Nature's strong control  Says "Sweet Penelope thy steps are free  "To guide thy father or to follow me"  The sire with Question's agitated air  Looks up for the decision of the fair  She could not speak but still to Nature true  O'er her flush'd cheek her decent veil she drew  The husband and the sire who heard her sigh  Both understood her exquisite reply  And the proud father felt his pangs beguil'd  By the sweet graces of his modest child  He bless'd and bade her go but on the spot  Often revisited and ne'er forgot  His fondness rais'd with a regret serene  A fair memorial of that tender scene  A graceful statue of a female frame  Sacred to love and Modesty its name  In which kind Sculpture by her speaking power  Express'd the feelings of that parting hour  See NOTE XV    Enchanting Art such ever be thy tone  As graceful Nature may be proud to own  No forms of elegance Fame ranks above  Thy groups of filial and parental love  Witness ye brothers of Sicilian name  Who pass'd through Aetna's desolating flame  Each nobly loaded with a parent's weight  Spar'd by receding

Claudian's verse I see your bosoms thrill  And with a graceful terror tremble still  See NOTE XVI    O lovely Sculpture when to thee unjust  Ravage condemns thy offspring to the dust  Though form'd with power and merit to endure  Through many a peaceful age of praise secure  May Muses conscious of thy gen'rous aim  Still of thy ruin'd works the worth proclaim  And to a new and firmer life

studious hour  As Friendship dictates the presiding power  Who when I incense on your altars throw  Guides my just hand and gives my heart to glow  Ingenuous Sculpture in thy long career  Of various fortune in thy Pagan sphere  Thou art intitled to the noblest praise  For adding force to worth's reflected rays  'Twas thine to give in that dark world of strife  Ardour to virtue elegance to life  If Fortune to thy purest purpose blind  Lavish'd thy honours on the worthless mind  Indignant Freedom in some distant day  Would rise to vindicate thy moral sway  When her Timoleon with a guardian

WARM'D by the light they love the very fragments sound  An allusion to the frequentlycited verse of Juvenal  Dimidio magicae resonant ubi Memnone chordae  There is hardly any work of antiquity more celebrated than this mysterious image a favourite object of ancient and of modern curiosity Considering the attention paid to it in different ages it is singular that the mutilated statue should still retain a name which according to an ancient tradition was assigned to it improperly  This miraculous colossal figure is commonly called the Statue of Memnon and supposed to represent an Aethiopian prince of that name the son of Tithonus and Aurora but Pausanias from whom we derive one of the early accounts of it expressly says the inhabitants of the city where it was placed the Thebans of Aegypt asserted that it was  not a representation of Memnon    PAUSANIAS p edit Kuhnii  but of Phamenophis a native of their country "and I have heard persons affirm" continues Pausanias  that it is the statue of Sesostris which Cambyses broke asunder and now as much of it as extends from the head to the middle of the body is thrown down the remainder is still sitting and sounds every day at the rising of the sun Its sound is most like the bursting of a string on the harp or lyre  The intelligent and accurate Strabo has recorded his own visit in a more early age to this statue in company with his friend Aelius Gallus and a military train He declares that he heard the miraculous sound but intimates a doubt whether it really proceeded from the base from the fragment of the figure or from the artifice of persons who formed a busy circle round it    STRABO Lib xvii p edit  Strabo does not assign any name to the statue in question but calls the scene where it was placed the Memnonium "Here" he says  are two colossal figures each of a single stone and near to each other One is preserved the upper part of the other has fallen and as they say by an earthquake  The sagacious geographer expresses in very strong terms his unwillingness to believe that the surprising sound he heard could be the spontaneous production of the stone itself      A respectable traveller of our own country the learned faithful and elaborate Pococke has laboured to gratify curiosity concerning this  this celebrated image by a very minute description illustrated by engravings yet with every advantage that erudition and a survey of the fragment could afford him he is obliged to leave the subject still involved in considerable darkness for among the various statues that he examined in this interesting scene the ruins of Thebes he found that two of them had pretensions to be regarded as the miraculous image  Mr de Caylus has distinguished the statue of remote antiquity from that of a later time in the following remark on Aegyptian antiquities  Il ne faut pas confondre la statue de Memnon dont parle Pline avec celle qui subsiste et qui a inspiré une si grande curiosité aux voyageurs anciens et modernes non seulement cette dernière est colossale mais elle est de granite D'ailleurs elle étoit antique à l'egard de Pline puisqu' elle étoit placée de son tems dans l'endroit qu'elle occupe aujourdhui c'està dire hors de la ville de Thèbes assez près des tombeaux des anciens rois d' Aegypte et qu'elle avoit été élevée avant la conquête que les Perses firent de ce pays tandis que la statue de  basalte  que Pline presente comme un objet beaucoup moins considérable étoit consacrée dans un temple de Sérapis dont le culte n'a été introduit en Aegypte que sous les Ptolémées  Antiquités de M de CAYLUS tom v p  and of these he has given the following circumstantial account  In the second court of the temple are remains of two statues of black granite That to the west which is sitting measured from the hand to the elbow five feet thence to the shoulder four The head is three feet and a half long and the ear is one foot in length The statue to the east is three feet five inches long in the foot At a distance from it is the head with the cap It is three feet six inches long and behind it is the ornament of the domeleaf Some persons have thought that one of these is the statue of Memnon From the temple I went to the statues which I shall call the colossal statues of Memnon They are towards MedinetHabou I spent above half a day at these statues They are of a very particular sort of porous hard granite such as I never saw before It most resembles the eaglestone  The statues look to the southsoutheast and are on a pedestal or plinth entirely plain That to the north is thirty feet long and  seventeen broad The pedestal of the other is thirtythree feet long and nineteen wide and they are about thirty feet apart That to the south is of one stone The statue to the north has been broken off at the middle above the arms that lie on the hams and it has been built up with five tiers of stonesone to the top of the clinch of the elbow another almost half way up the arm one to the armpits the fourth to the neck and the fifth the head and neck of one stone The other tiers have two stones in front except that the middle tier has three and there are two stones in the thickness of the statue The feet are broken a quarter off from the toes but as I did not take a particular draught of the parts of the statue that are maimed I thought it better to give it entire from the drawing and observations I did make I found the height from the bottom of the foot to the top of the knee to be about nineteen feet from the bottom of the foot to the ankle two feet six inches to the top of the instep four feet the foot is five feet broad and the leg is four feet deep The ornament behind the head seemed to be the domeleaf as I have it on a statue of Harpocrates At the side of the legs are two reliefs and one between the legs of the natural height but much defaced Between the former and the great statue are hieroglyphics The pedestal of the imperfect statue is cracked across at the distance of about ten feet from the back part There are also some flaws and cracks in the other statue but it is of one stone which I dare positively affirm and in which I could not be mistaken having been twice at the statues I spent half a day there and took down in my notes an account of every stone of which the upper part of the other is built On the pedestal of the imperfect statue is a Greek epigram and on the insteps and legs for about eight feet high are several inscriptions in Greek and Latin some being epigrams in honour of Memnon others the greater part testimonies of those who heard  the sound and some also in unknown characters All the inscriptions are ill cut and in bad language both on account of the hardness of the stone and the ignorance of the people who probably made money by cutting these inscriptions for those that came to hear the sound I copied them with all the exactness I could though many of them were very difficult to be understood and I was not entirely undisturbed while I was doing it  Thus far I have transcribed the industrious and accurate Pococke because his mensuration affords a satisfactory idea of Aegyptian sculpture I omit his discussion of the arguments concerning the point which of the two statues he has mentioned is the real Memnon because some ideas suggested by a later and more lively traveller of France have led me to believe that the report of Pausanias was perfectly true and that the marvellous statue was never intended to represent the prince of Aethiopia How it acquired the name of Memnon we shall gradually discover  M Savary in his elegant amusing Letters on Aegypt has compared such reliques of Thebes as he could investigate himself with the descriptions of this magnificent scenery that are to be found in ancient authors particularly Diodorus Siculus and Strabo by whose assistance he endeavours to throw new light on this miraculous image He falls however into an evident mistake in saying that Strabo calls it the Statue of Memnon That illustrious and accurate geographer only says after naming a place which he calls  a word that may signify the Temple or perhaps merely the monuments of Memnon that it contained two colossal statues which he proceeds to describe in the manner I have already mentioned But the ingenious French traveller borrowing perhaps a hint from Strabo    STRABO p  though he does not intimate  that he did has ventured to bestow on the broken Colossus commonly called the statue of Memnon the name of Osymanduas as he conceives that the dimensions of the figure and the scene around it sufficiently answer to the magnificent description by which Diodorus has commemorated the tomb of that Aegyptian monarch whose title Pococke bestows on another colossal figure M Savary goes still farther in his probable conjecture and imagines that Cambyses was tempted to break the stupendous image by the inscription which it bore according to the narrative of the Greek historian which inscription the French traveller translates in the following words  Je suis Osimanduè roi des rois Si l'on veut savoir combien je suis grand et où je repose que l'on detruise quelqu'un de ces ouvrages    DIODORUS SICULUS      I am Osymanduas the king of kings If any one wishes to know how great I am and where I repose let him  conquer  some of my works  The word  literally "let him  conquer  " is rendered by the English traveller "let him  surpass  " by the French traveller  let him  destroy  The latter in his interpretation of this superb inscription seems to reduce it to a level with the pleasant mysterious epitaph in Gil Bias "A qui esta encerrada el alma del licenciado Pedro Garcias" and to suppose that it was designed to lead some ingenious interpreter to the happy discovery of a latent treasure Though I presume to rally the accomplished traveller of France for his subtle construction I am still particularly inclined to credit the conjecture of M Savary concerning the proper title of this celebrated colossal figure because it tends to confirm another conjecture by which I would account for the manner in which it acquired the very different name of Memnon Diodorus Siculus in describing the tomb of Osymanduas and the colossal statues with which it was adorned declares that these statues were the work of  Memnon Sycnites This sculptor must have been an artist of the highest celebrity in his time hence perhaps his most remarkable statue assumed the name of its maker in preference to that of the monarch whom it was designed to represent and hence as the name of this marvellous sculptor happened to be also the name by which an heroic prince of Aethiopia was distinguished who is supposed to have founded the city of Abydus in Aegypt many fabulous stories seem to have been invented to account for what in all probability never existed I mean a sculptural representation of the Aethiopian hero the ally of Priam and the unsuccessful antagonist of Achilles among the colossal statues of Thebes  Having expatiated so far on the name of this interesting image I will add but a few remarks on its miraculous sound Strabo and Savary seem to have agreed in the idea that the wonder was rather to be slighted as the mysterious device of priestcraft than to be regarded as a genuine miracle of Nature Yet the eminent philosophical poet of Derbyshire who has introduced this fascinating statue into his delightful Botanic Garden appears in a note to that poem to think that philosophy might very honestly contrive to produce a similar effect  It may be well worth the attention both of artists and philosophers to consider how far it may be possible and proper to engage the sense of hearing as an assistant to enhance the pleasure of sight when that pleasure arises from any grand work of Art Antiquity has proved that the picture of a battle may be exhibited to advantage with an accompaniment of martial music and perhaps in a great naval monument it would be easy to introduce and conceal such works of musical mechanism as might occasionally increase in a most powerful degree the delight arising from such a spectacle  I cannot quit the statue of Memnon without mentioning the most illustrious of his ancient visitors These were the emperor Hadrian with  his empress Sabina and a prince perhaps not less accomplished and certainly more amiable than Hadrian that deserving idol of the Roman people Germanicus The historian Tacitus who has recorded the visit of the latter to this attractive statue says not a syllable expressive of his own opinion concerning the miraculous sound  Ceterum Germanicus aliis quoque miraculis intendit animum quorum praecipua fuere Memnonis sa  ea effigies ubi radiis solis icta est vocalem sonum reddens  TACITUS  I confess myself inclined to imagine that the marvel originated in the avaricious ingenuity of those who were engaged in shewing this celebrated spectacle but a different opinion was entertained by a modern writer on statues whose authority is so respectable that I shall submit to the reader his more candid ideas on this interesting image The Abbé Comte de Guasco whose learned and elegant historical essay "De l'Usage des Statues" I shall have very frequent occasion to cite and to applaud speaks of this figure in his chapter on the prodigies and miracles attributed to statues He describes it as a statue raised to Memnon by Amenophis the Second on the banks of the Nile and after noticing the incredulity of Strabo he says in a note which I shall transcribe that modern travellers had assured him they had been witnesses of the phenomenon which in his opinion may be fairly and naturally explained by atmospherical influence  Des voyageurs modernes m'ont assuré avoir été temoins de ce phénomene Il n'est pas étonnant que dans des siècles où la croyance en la divinité du soleil étoit dominante il fût regardé comme surnaturel et que ce bruit fût trouvé harmonieux Mais dans un tems où la physique est mieux connue il s'expliquera naturellement La raréfaction de l'atmosphere et la dilatation des solides causée par la chaleur des rayons

to thy fervent soul  An allusion to the following Sonnet which the author had the pleasure of addressing to his friend several years ago before he visited Italy a brief but early presage of his present excellence  Flaxman young artist of an ardent mind  Whose just ambition by the Greeks inspir'd  Thirsts for pure Attic glory though inclin'd  To doubt if partial Nature e'er assign'd  To

which those personages have recently appeared on the canvass of Mr Fuseli The Miltonic Gallery is a noble monument of industry and genius I seize with pleasure an opportunity of declaring my sentiments of its merit because those sentiments are confirmed by the more valuable judgment of the friend to whom this publication is addressed  NOTE III Ver  And consecrated life to toil intense  Milton describing most ingenuously the dawn of literary ambition in his own youthful mind has the following expressions  After mentioning the favour he experienced from his learned acquaintance of Italy he says  I began thus far to assent both to them and divers of my friends here at home and not less to an inward prompting which now grew daily upon me that by labour and intent study which I take to be my portion in this life joined with the strong propensity of Nature I might perhaps leave something so written to aftertimes as they should not willingly let it die  Prose Works quarto edit

qualities which so eminently distinguished this sublime philosopher Two striking examples of it are recorded the first drawn from a conversation in which Newton with the simplicity of a mind truly great spoke what he thought himself of his own mental exertions the second from a passage in one of his letters containing almost the very words of the verse which gave rise to this note  NOTE V Ver  For low and little cares of languid life  The two celebrated and amiable physicians Zimmerman and Tissot whose writings deserve the title affixed to the famous library of Aegypt "Medicine for the Mind" afford most valuable advice and consolation to those votaries of art or science who may have been forced by sickness or sorrow to suspend their favourite pursuits Few literary invalids can fail to feel themselves soothed and encouraged to struggle with calamity by the touching description which Zimmerman has given to the world of his own sufferings and those of his learned and accomplished friends Garve and Mendelsohn in his beneficent Essay on Solitude Some readers indeed are so fastidious as to think that infirmity and affliction should on no occasion obtrude their private grievances past or present on the eye of the public but every writer who records with the eloquence of real sensibility calamities that he has encountered with any degree of success is certainly a friend to suffering humanity as his record may furnish present or future fellowsufferers with a fresh incentive to fortitude or exertion and the general sympathy of Nature will probably make him ample amends for any accidental censure that he may happen to incur from unfeeling individuals  NOTE VI Ver  With thee instructive guide to study Rome  The author had pleased himself with a prospect of enjoying the society and taking a share in the studies of his friend during the  last of the several years that the sculptor devoted to Italy but he relinquished this favourite design at the earnest entreaty of some other friends who requested him to remain in England for the purpose of writing a Life of Milton He sacrificed to their request a project that seemed to promise him infinite advantage and delight Time and chance conferred on him an unexpected and inestimable recompence for that sacrifice in the friendship of Mr Cowper which his attachment to Milton proved the means of his acquiring  NOTE VII Ver  On whom that coyest queen her smile bestows  The paragraph which closes with this line is founded on a passage of singular beauty in one of Milton's Latin letters to his friend Diodati  Unde fit ut qui spretis quae vulgus pravâ rerum aestimatione opinatur id sentire et loqui et esse audet quod summa per omne aevum sapientia optimum esse docuit illi me protinus sicuti reperiam

daring to aspire in sentiment language and conduct to what the highest wisdom through every age has taught us as most excellent to him I unite myself by a sort of necessary attachment and if I am so influenced by nature or destiny that by no exertion or labours of my own I may exalt myself to this summit of worth and  honour yet no powers of Heaven or earth will hinder me from looking with reverence and affection upon those who have thoroughly attained this glory or appear engaged in the successful pursuit of it  END OF THE NOTES ON THE FIRST EPISTLE  NOTES ON THE  SECOND EPISTLE  NOTE I Ver  THE fav'rite idol of benighted zeal  An ingenious foreigner who has added extensive learning to a lively imagination and who published in our country a work of considerable magnitude on the origin and progress of the Arts indulges a conjecture that the head of the Urus or savage bull was the earliest work of sculpture This idea struck him so forcibly that he has endeavoured to display and confirm a conjecture not very probable in the two following passages of his elaborate and amusing researches  Ces observations nous decouvrent la marche de la sculpture et celle de la théologie des anciens Cette théologie admettant d'abord un Etre Suprême qu'elle regarda comme la pere invisible de toutes choses le représenta par l'emblême du boeuf sauvage Le terme Tho ou Théo exprimant cet animal produisit le mot Théos d'où vint celui  de Deus qui signifia Dieu parceque son emblême fût primitivement représenté sous la forme de l'individu dont ce mot étoit le nom La sculpture en imitant la figure de cet animal rendit l'idée de la théologie Cette idée préscrivit l'objet qui fit peutêtre decouvrir cet art ingenieux ou du moins qui encouragea ces premiers essais  Recherches sur l'Origine l'Esprit et les Progres des Arts tom  i  p    The author says in the same volume where he labours to strengthen his conjecture by the authority of very early medals  Ces médailles frappées dans l'orient par un peuple Scythe nous représentent la figure du boeuf à tête humaine telle qu'on l'avoit dans un pais très voisin de celui dont elle vint et chez les descendans d'un peuple qui le premier employa cette emblême Il passa delà dans la Grece dans la Sicile et dans l'Italie ou on le voit si frequemment représenté sur les médailles de Gela d'Agrigente de Naples et de tant d'autres villes repandues dans toutes les parties de la Grece S'il est vrai comme je le crois que cette figure fût le principe de celles des autres dieux représentés sous la forme humaine elle doit être regardée comme le germe et le premier pasde la sculpture  P  NOTE II Ver  The new attraction of a modell'd face  Two respectable writers of antiquity the philosopher Athenagoras and the naturalist Pliny agree in deriving the art of modelling from the celebrated though anonymous Maid of Corinth whose father Dibutades a potter was so pleased with the ingenuity of his daughter in drawing the shade of her sleeping lover by lamplight on a wall that he is said to have filled her outline with clay and hardening it with  the rest of his earthenware to have thus produced a bust or a medallion for it might be either which was preserved at Corinth as a curious rudiment of art till that city was destroyed by Mummius according to a tradition mentioned by Pliny  Fingere ex argilla similitudines Dibutades Sicyonius Figulus primus invenit Corinthi filiae operâ quae capta amore juvenis illo abeunte peregre umbram ex facie ejus ad lucernam in pariete lineis circumscripsit quibus pater ejus impressa argilla typum fecit cum caeteris fictilibus induratum igni proposuit eumque servatum in Nymphaeo donec Corinthum Mummius everteret tradunt  PLIN lib cap  The Athenian philosopher who lived a considerable time after the destruction and after the revival of Corinth speaks of this interesting production of early art as being still preserved when he wrote in the reign of Marcus Aurelius    ATHENAGORAS edit Oxon p    The anecdote of the Corinthian Maid is so pleasing to the imagination that we cannot be surprized at its being readily received as genuine history M de Caylus makes a very just remark upon it in his excellent Memoir on the Sculpture of the Ancients  Cette idée est melée de vraisemblance dans le détail et d'agrément dans l'invention mais quand on voudroit douter de ces prétendus faits il est encore plus commode de les adopter on ne pourroit mettre à la place que d'autres suppositions  Mem de l' Academie tom  xxv  p    NOTE III Ver  Till impious worship grew from tender grief  For a father afflicted with untimely mourning when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away now honoured him as  a god which was then a dead man and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices  Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings  The Wisdom of Solomon ch xiv v  Herodotus has recorded the very singular honours that were paid to a deceased daughter by the afflicted Mycerinus an Aegyptian monarch  From the energy of those inventive passions love and grief we might be induced to suppose that the earliest efforts of rude sculpture would be such as they suggested for the purpose of obtaining a resemblance however imperfect of some mortal infinitely beloved or regretted but history proves that superstitious fear is a passion still more creative and in Greece which may be considered as the home though not the native climate of Sculpture it is evident that endeavours to represent different divinities by the rudest symbols preceded every attempt to express human features by any kind of model Stocks and stones were confessedly worshipped as celestial powers in that land of ingenuity before any thing like a statue bust or medallion appeared The trunk of an old tree was solemnly preserved by the Thespians and idolized as their Juno  Clemens Alexandrinus who gives a similar account of several ancient idols informs us that these rude symbols were gradually exchanged for statues of the human form which acquired the appellation    But stones of a cubic form were their more general symbols and Pausanias mentions a collection of these at Pharae in Achaia in number about thirty and each distinguished by the name of a particular divinity    PAUSANIAS p  They stood near a statue of Mercury and were probably regarded in the age of Pausanias as curious reliques of that ancient mode of worship which according to his account had been prevalent among all the Greeks  At Orchomenos the favourite seat of the Graces so happily celebrated by Pindar those interesting divinities were originally represented by three white stones When a rude symbol was exchanged in process of time for a more refined image the Greeks were solicitous to preserve some idea of the original type a practice well illustrated by D'Hancarville in his remark on these memorable symbols that first represented the Graces He imagines that the union of the symbols gave rise to the attitude which these patronesses of Grecian art assumed in their subsequent form  L'union des trois pierres blanches qui indiquoient les Graces à Orchomene fut conservée lorsque la sculpture convertit ces pierres en statues le point par où elles se touchoient devint la main par laquelle chacune d'elles se reposa sur les bras de l'autre tandis que de celle qu'elles avoient libre elles tinrent les attributs qui les distinguoient Cette attitude charmante continua d'indiquer l'avantage qu'elles se pretent l'une à l'autre l'harmonie qui les rend inseparables et le plaisir qu'elles procurent par leur union Telles on les voit sur les médailles sur beaucoup de pierres gravées dans un petit groupe qui appartient à la maison de Borghèse mais particulierement dans les antiquites d'Herculaneum David tom iii pl  D'HANCARVILLE  Antiq Etrus  tom iv p  The first Minerva adored at Athens is said to have been nothing more than a rough pointed stake  "Sine effigie rudis palus et informe lignum" TERTULLIAN  In contemplating the great contrast between such objects of popular veneration and the works of Phidias and Praxiteles the mind takes a generous delight in the progressive powers of human ingenuity The pleasure we naturally feel in such a contrast has induced many writers to investigate with great labour the obscure origin of different arts M D'Hancarville in the ingenious dissertations  prefixed to his Etruscan Antiquities has endeavoured to trace the rise and early progress of sculpture through many centuries of darkness prior to the age of Daedalus a period with which the active enthusiasm of Winkelman had seemed to satisfy itself in his elaborate and animated History of Ancient Art  If the conjectures of a writer may be trusted who ventures to delineate a period so very distant and dark the origin of Grecian sculpture may be assigned to the reign of Apis the successor of Phoroneus about years before the Christian aera  Ainsi l'invention de la statuaire remonte jusqu'au tems de cet Apis qui finit vers l'an de la période Julienne apeuprès mil sept cent soixante dix huit ans avant la naissance de Jesus Christ  D'HANCARVILLE Antiq Etrus tom iii p  and according to a very reasonable supposition of M D'Hancarville this delightful and difficult art was more than a thousand years in proceeding by insensible degrees from a state of rude barbarity to its period of exquisite perfection Of its most remarkable steps and of many memorable artists who particularly contributed to its advancement I shall speak in subsequent notes I return to the immediate subject of thisthe disposition to fond idolatry in an afflicted parent Two striking though very different characters of the ancient world are remarkable examples of this disposition Nimrod and Cicero The strong feelings of nature on the loss of a beloved child produced the same wildness of affectionate fancy in the imperial hunter and in the republican philosopher Those who recollect the infinite tenderness with which the great Roman orator speaks in his Letters of his darling Tullia will forgive and pity the unhappy father whose excess of affliction led him so far to forget his own philosophical principles as to think very seriously of building not a tomb but a temple to his departed child as a proper object of worship The Abbé Mongault has clearly ascertained this intention of Cicero in his interesting remarks on the Fanum Tulliae in the Memoirs of the French Academy  NOTE IV Ver  Thy fam'd Prometheus thy primaeval pride  Of all the celebrated personages of antiquity there is not one who seems to have had a harder fate in every point of view than this extraordinary character He has peculiar claims to a place in this Work from having been long regarded as the very first of Pagan artists and indeed the first of philosophers    AESCHYLUS  The poets have represented him as suffering the severest of tortures for ingenuity and benevolence His acute and energetic spirit nobly painted by Aeschylus rendered him a favourite hero of the Athenian and afterwards of the Roman stage as we may conjecture from the fragments of Accius At Athens he had an altar inscribed to him in the Academy and a festival was held in his honour distinguished by a race in which the candidates for the prize carried a flame as they ran and he only was considered as the victor who brought it alive to the goal    PAUSANIAS p  M de Caylus has inserted in the first volume of his Antiquities a vignette formed from a monument found in Athens alluding to this race  Pausanias who mentions this tribute to the memory of Prometheus relates also that the inhabitants of Phocis preserved with great veneration some reliques of the very clay from which this first of modellers was said to have fashioned man    P  Yet some of the Pagan philosophers did not scruple to deny the mortal existence of Prometheus and to reduce him to a mere symbol of man's inventive faculty Some early Christian writers treat him with still  more severity The respectable Lactantius in particular allows him his existence and his ingenuity but describes him as employing his rare powers to the basest of purposes to promote the preposterous ambition of his relation Jupiter and as contriving by his sculptural art to convert the tyrant into a god  Stultus igitur et amens qui adorat quod ipse fabricavit cujus artificii detestabilis et inepti auctor fuit Prometheus patruo Jovis Japeto natus Nam cum primum Jupiter summo potitus imperio tanquam deum se constituere vellet ac templa condere et quaereret aliquem qui humanam figuram posset exprimere tunc Prometheus extitit qui hominis effigiem de pingui luto figuraret ita verisimiliter ut novitas ac subtilitas artis miraculo esset Denique illum et sui temporis homines postea poetae tanquam fictorem veri ac vivi hominis prodiderunt et nos quoties fabrefacta signa laudamus vivere illa et spirare dicimus et hic quidem auctor fuit fictilium simulacrorum  LACTANTIUS tom ii p edit    Of an interesting character so long the sport and victim of fancy fable and conjecture it is natural to desire but very difficult to obtain a simple rational history Who shall solve the doubt whether Prometheus really existed or not He has been called a Cretan an Aegyptian a Scythian and Olaus Rudbecke in that marvellous work of extensive erudition and fanciful ingenuity his Atlantica seems inclined to make him a Swede and claim him for a countryman with the rest of the Titans Of our own modern writers Lord Bacon and Mr Bryant two respectable names agree with the emperor Julian in their inclination to melt this primaeval artist into a mere allegory I confess myself rather inclined to the opinion of the learned and intelligent Brucker who in his elaborate and candid History of Philosophy has very modestly stated such conjectures of his own concerning this celebrated personage as account in a very probable manner for all his fabulous adventures This author imagines that Prometheus was a servant high in the confidence of Osiris an Aegyptian monarch who venturing without the permission of his sovereign to communicate the arts of Aegypt to the ruder Greeks was imprisoned for that offence and tormented till the Aegyptian officer who guarded him was slain by Hercules  and the prisoner set free  Dicemus tamen quod nobis hac de re in mentem venerit Supra audivimus veterum quosdam referre Prometheum ex Aegypto in occidentem

that the artists as well as the poets of antiquity were employed in giving celebrity to his interesting character  We learn from Achilles Tatius and from Seneca that the two painters Evanthes and Parrhasius executed remarkable pictures of his adventures and we have reason to believe from the two following epigrams of the Anthologia that the Grecian sculptors also represented his tortures with admirable energy        Grotii Versio  Artibus auxilium per me data flamma sed arte  Spector ego et flammis heu sine fine miser  O hominum ingratum semper genus hanc ne Prometheus  A fabris post tot

certainly not the first mortal who induced his fellowcreatures to worship an idol of the human shape Cedrenus asserts that Serug and Terah the progenitors of Abraham were both makers of images and adds that Abraham burnt the idols of Terah his father    Those who have endeavoured to ascertain the age of Prometheus place him in a later period and make him a cotemporary of Moses  "Prometheum Deucalionis patrem septimo anno Moseos natum esse narrat Cyrillus"  Nota in LACTANTIUM tom i p  The worship of idols as the president Goguet justly remarks in his learned and sensible book on the

humaine  GOGUET tom i p  NOTE V Ver  Aim'd at eternal sway in animated brass  The following works of public magnificence are ascribed to Semiramis  She built likewise two palaces at each end of the bridge upon the bank of the river Euphrates That on the west had an high and stately wall made of a round circumference upon which were pourtrayed in the bricks before they were burnt all sorts of living creatures as if it were to the life laid with great art in curious colours This wall was in circuit forty furlongs three hundred bricks thick and in height as Ctesias says a hundred yards upon which were turrets a hundred and forty yards high The third and most inward wall immediately surrounded the palace thirty furlongs in compass and far surmounted the middle wall both in height and thickness and on this wall and the towers were represented the shapes of all sorts of living creatures artificially expressed in most lively colours Especially was represented a general hunting of all sorts of wild beasts each four cubits high and upwards Amongst these was to be seen Semiramis on horseback striking a leopard through with a dart and next to her her husband Ninus in close fight with a lion piercing him with his lance This palace far excelled that on the other side of the river both in greatness and adornments for the outmost wall of that made of wellburnt brick was but thirty furlongs in compass Instead of the curious portraiture of beasts there were the brazen statues of Ninus and Semiramis the great officers and of Jupiter whom the Babylonians call Belus and likewise armies drawn up in battalia and divers sorts of hunting were there represented to  the great diversion and pleasure of the beholders In the middle of the city she built a temple to Jupiter whom the Babylonians call Belus Upon the top she placed three statues of beaten gold of Jupiter Juno and Rhea That of Jupiter stood upright in the posture as if he were walking He was forty feet in height and weighed a thousand Babylonish talents The statue of Rhea was of the same weight sitting on a golden throne having two lions standing on either side one at her knees and near to them two exceeding great serpents of silver weighing thirty talents apiece Here likewise the image of Juno stood upright and weighed eight hundred talents grasping a serpent by the head in her right hand and holding a sceptre adorned with precious stones in her left  DIODORUS SICULUS translated by BOOTH b ii ch  Such are the wonders of early art which Diodorus has recorded as the works of Semiramis on the authority of Ctesias a native of Cnidos who became the favourite physician of a Persian monarch Artaxerxes Mnemon and in that situation had better opportunities of acquiring historical information concerning the antiquities of Asia than his countrymen in general possessed Of Ctesias's extensive writings only a few fragments remain which are printed as a supplement to Herodotus in the best editions of that historian The credit of Ctesias has been severely attacked both by ancient and modern writers but M Freret vindicates his veracity in several particulars like a very able advocate in more than one of his elaborate dissertations on points of ancient history inserted in the Memoirs of the French Academy The kind of credit that we may rationally give to the curious description that I have cited seems to be very candidly ascertained by the Abbé Guasco who thinks that although works of such magnificence were hardly executed at a period so early as that assigned to Semiramis yet it is probable that such actually appeared in Babylon in later ages but before art had made  any considerable progress in Greece or in Aegypt  Quelque exagerée qu'on a raison de croire la description que fait Ctesias des monumens de l'art statuaire qui ornoient les palais et le temple pretendus bâtis par l'ancienne Semiramis quelqu' anachronisme que l'on suppose à juste titre dans les époques données par cet auteur fabuleux à ces monumens il n'en resulte pas moins que cet art avoit déjà fait de grands progrès en Asie durant les anciennes monarchies de Ninive et de Babylone car aucun art ne produit de grands monumens toutàcoup et ce n'est que successivement qu'il atteint certains degrès de perfection Donc quoique les statues de Belus de Semiramis de Ninus avec tout le brillant cortege et appareil qui les accompagnoient ne fussent pas des productions d'une époque si reculée mais des monumens posterieurs executés sous quelqu'un de leurs successeurs du même nom qui voulut immortaliser par là les fondateurs de leurs monarchies il n'est pas moins constant que ces monumens surpassoient en elegance et peutêtre en antiquité les premiers que l'on connoisse dans la Greee et peutêtre même ceux d'Aegypte ils sont tout au moins des indicés que l'on s'étoit déjà exercé depuis longtems dans ces sortes d'ouvrages  The same respectable author observes that Josephus and Herodotus attribute with more reason these embellishments of Babylon to Nebuchodonosor and Nitocris his wife and that their account is confirmed by what the prophet Daniel has said concerning the statues of gold and silver which adorned the temples of that city He adds that Assyria had more than one Semiramis  Parceque ce nom n'étant qu'une expression generique composée de plusieurs titres de dignité selon le genre et la tournure ordinaire de la langue orientale il fût commun à plusieurs reines d'Assyrie  De l'Usage des Statues  p  Several statues of Semiramis are commemorated by antient authors Lucian speaks of one standing by the temple of the Syrian goddess and  pointing to the mansion of the divinity as if to acknowledge her own past offence in having arrogated to herself the honours due only to Juno Valerius Maximus has described another not less remarkable in which the Assyrian queen was represented with her tresses in a state of disorder and thus signifying the rapidity with which she is said to have hurried from her toilet to suppress a revolt in Babylon  Semiramis Assyriorum regina cum ei circa cultum capitis sui occupatae nuntiatum esset Babylonem defecisse altera parte crinium adhuc soluta protinus ad eam expugnandam cucurrit nec prius decorem capillorum in ordinem quam tantam urbem in potestatem suam redegit Quocirca statua ejus Babylone posita est illo habitu quo ad ultionem exigendam celeritate praecipiti tetendit  VALERIUS MAXIMUS lib c  Let me add on the authority of Aelian that Semiramis was as much celebrated for her beauty as for her talents and power    AELIAN Var Hist lib c    NOTE VI Ver  And hold Semiramis herself a dream  The boldest enemy to the mortal existence of this celebrated queen is the illustrious mythologist Mr Bryant who confidently says in the second volume of his great work  I have shewn that there was no such person as Semiramis  and again  I think it is plain that Semiramis was an emblem and that the name was a compound of Sama Ramas or Ramis and it signified the Divine Token the Type of Providence and as a military ensign for as such it was used it may with some latitude be interpreted the Standard of the Most High It consisted of the figure of a dove which was probably circled with the iris as those two emblems were often represented together All who went under that standard or who paid any deference to that emblem were stiled Semarim or Samorim  Without robbing this highly respectable writer of the credit he justly derives from having thrown many satisfactory rays of light on the dove of the ark it might still perhaps be no very difficult task to establish the existence of one or of more than one Semiramis against the supposition of his annihilating fancy and should the animated Mr Morrit amuse himself and his readers in vindicating the life and beauty of Semiramis with the same spirit that he defended the palace of old Priam against the destroying whirlwind of Mr Bryant's imagination I hope the venerable Coryphaeus of classical erudition who has himself made so free with the arguments and conjectures of the highest literary names will not feel angrily unwilling to indulge in a similar freedom a spirited and graceful scholar of whom we may say in the words of Homer allowing to his aged antagonist the dignity of a sovereign in Grecian literature      NOTE VII Ver  And guards thy massive monarchs with respect  Of all the modern writers on early sculpture M de Caylus seems to have rendered the most liberal justice to the merit of the Aegyptians in the following remark  Le gout pour la solidité les a empêchés de faire saillir aucune partie et les a bornés à des attitudes simples qui sont devenues monotones et cette monotonie qui n'étoit peutêtre pas un défaut à leurs yeux devoit être inévitable les combinaisons des attitudes étant fort resserrées et l'action étant absolument retranchée Cependant il ne faut  pas croire pour cela que leurs artistes aient toujours été depourvûs d'une sorte de finesse dans les dètails Il est inutile de pousser plus loin cet examen on conviendra que leurs sculpteurs ont senti et exprimé le grand et c'est en céci que consiste la premiere et la plus essentielle partie de l'art puisqu' elle seule éléve l'esprit du spectateur C'est encore le même desire de faire passer leurs ouvrages à la posterité qui leur a fait préférer les basreliefs en creux à ceux qui sont de demibosse ces derniers étant exposés à un plus grand nombre d'accidens Enfin ils ont connu toutes les parties de la sculpture jusqu'à la gravure des pierres  Antiquités  tom i p  That the Aegyptians delighted in the sculpture of gems we have a pleasing proof in the circumstance recorded by Aelian that the chief of their judges wore round his neck an image of Truth engraven on a sapphire  AELIAN edit Perizonii p    It is remarkable that Lucian by birth an Assyrian and in his youth a sculptor by profession speaks with serious esteem of the ancient Aegyptians as distinguished by their meritorious efforts in the infancy of Art  NOTE VIII Ver  For Greece their Helen was by Aegypt rear'd  Pausanias asserts that the figures of stone on the tomb of Coraebus were the most ancient in Greece and as Coraebus lived in the age of Cecrops who had migrated into that country from Aegypt it is probable that the Greeks derived from the attendants of this Aegyptian  their knowledge of an art which began to display itself among them at that early period D'Hancarville ingeniously interprets the fables concerning the stones of Deucalion and the serpent's teeth of Cadmus as alluding to the origin of Sculpture  Deucalion et Coraebe furent contemporains de Cécrops Cadmus vécut avec Hellen de qui les Grecs prirent le nom d'Hellenes il étoit fils de Deucalion Les fables disoient de ce dernier que des hommes naquirent des pierres qu'il jetta par derriere lui après le deluge qui arriva de son tems ces mêmes fables racontoient que des guerriers tout armés naquirent des dents du serpent tirés par Cadmus et semés dans la terre Comme vers le regne de Cecrops on fit en pierre les figures du tombeau du Coraebe ces fables étoient peutêtre inventées pour marquer dans le style dont on se servoit alors qu' au tems de Deucalion et de Cadmus l'usage de faire avec des pierres et de l'ivoire des figures qui représentoient des hommes s'introduisit dans la Gréce  Antiquités Etrusques  tom iii p  The Aegyptians seem to have taken a pride in their early distinction for Herodotus says they boasted of having invented statues and Diodorus Siculus mentions their idea that men were first created in Aegypt  NOTE IX Ver  The paths of knowledge truth and fame are yours  An allusion to the following passage from the th of Pindar's Olympic Odes in which that poet has happily expressed the high ideas he entertained on the influence of the Graces    In the Memoirs of the French Academy there is an animated dissertation "Sur les Graces" by that amiable scholar the Abbé Massieu who has collected from ancient authors every particular relating to these favourite divinities of Greece  The following passage enumerates some of the most eminent works of art devoted to their honour  Enfin les anciens aimoient à marquer leur zèle pour leurs dieux par divers monumens qu'ils élévoient à leur gloire par des tableaux par des statues par des inscriptions par des médailles Or toute la Gréce étoit pleine de semblables monumens que la piété publique avoit consacrés aux Graces On voyoit dans la plupart des villes leurs figures faites par les plus grands maitres Il y avoit à Pergame un tableau de ces déesses peint pour Pythagore de Paros Un autre à Smyrne qui étoit de la main d'Apelle Socrate avoit fait leurs statues en marble et Bupale les fit en or Pausanias parle de plusieurs autres également recommendables par la richesse de la matière et par la beauté du travail Démosthène rapporte dans la harangue pour la couronne que les Athéniens ayant secouru les habitans de la Quersonèse dans un besoin pressant ceuxci pour éterniser le souvenir d'un tel bienfait élevèrent un autel avec cette inscription 'Autel consacré à celle des Graces qui préside á la reconnoissance  NOTE X Ver  To limit England in sphere of art  Every friend to literary merit must lament that writers of such deserved celebrity as Montesquieu and Winkelman could be induced to disfigure their immortal works with the supposition that the inhabitants of England labour under a natural incapacity of attaining excellence in  the fine arts a supposition that can only disgrace those who admit and endeavour to support it  NOTE XI Ver  And bless'd a bold progenitor in thee  Daedalus was universally revered by antiquity as the father of Grecian sculpture but in proportion as his genius became an object of public veneration his personal history was so involved in the decorations or disguises of fable that to the regret of those who love to investigate the lives of meritorious men it is hardly possible to obtain a satisfactory account of this celebrated sculptor architect and mechanist whose early and successful ingenuity has so justly endeared his name to every lover of art  The learned Junius has assigned a very copious article to Daedalus in his catalogue of antient artists and the Abbé Gedoyn the respectable translator of Quintilian and Pausanias has introduced a history of Daedalus into the Memoirs of the French Academy These two elaborate writers have collected all that antiquity could furnish to elucidate his life but they both seem to admit as an established fact one most dishonourable circumstance in the history of their hero which I am inclined to consider as not more entitled to serious credit than the most fabulous portion of his adventures I mean the horrid supposition that he enviously murdered his nephew and his disciple for possessing ingenuity superior to his own  Of this I shall speak in its place let me first relate the more early particulars that ancient writers have recorded concerning this celebrated sculptor He was by birth an Athenian and though authors differ on the name of his father they agree in representing him as the grandson  or greatgrandson of Erectheus the sixth sovereign of Athens and Pausanias asserts that he lived in the period when Oedipus reigned in Thebes that is about half a century before the siege of Troy Diodorus Siculus who may be called the earliest biographer of Daedalus that we possess describes him as having greatly improved the rude sculpture of his age and excited the admiration of his contemporaries before the charge of having destroyed his disciple reduced him to the necessity of flying from his country  In the account that Diodorus has given of this very improbable crime there is one particular that seems to mark the whole story as a fabulous invention It is said that this ingenious disciple the son of his sister was led to invent a saw by the accident of finding the jaw of a serpent and by observing the use to which its teeth might be successfully applied It is also said that Daedalus being surprised and questioned in the act of burying the murdered youth answered that he was consigning a serpent to the earth  The historian mentions it as a wonder and it seems one of those specious wonders which the Greeks were so fond of inventing that the same animal the serpent should prove both the source of a most useful invention and the means of detecting an execrable crime The supposed criminal is said to have been condemned by that solemn tribunal the Areopagus but the mode in which the royal sculptor is imagined to have accomplished the destruction of his disciple is such that it could hardly admit any legal proof of a murderous intention Ovid has briefly and forcibly stated the circumstance to which I allude  Daedalus invidit sacraque ex arce Minervae  Praecipitem misit lapsum mentitus  The poet adds that the falling youth was metamorphosed into a partridge by the pity of Minerva and I confess that I consider the metamorphosis and the murder as equally fabulous  Every good mind that reflects on the subject will esteem it hardly possible that a man in an elevated rank of life and blest himself with a variety of talents could be induced to murder a promising youth whom he had engaged to instruct and the child of his own sister for displaying such ingenuity as a master and a relation would be naturally disposed to admire and encourage A fact of this complexion ought for the honour of human nature never to be admitted except in cases where the evidence that supports it is irresistible  For the glory of Daedalus we may affirm that the improbable atrocity imputed to him is so far from being proved by any testimony that it rests only on dark tradition and the whole story has so much the air of a fable that it ought long ago to have been discountenanced and discarded by every serious biographer of this illustrious artist Yet writers are so apt to transcribe the wonderful tales of their predecessors without examination or to credit enormities ascribed to men of talents and distinction that this barbarous story has been credulously repeated from age to age The modern and enlightened authors who have recently discussed the history of Daedalus do not scruple to paint him as an assaisin The Abbé Gedoyn endeavours to varnish his own cruel credulity on this subject by the following remark  De tout tems une basse jalousie a été le vice des artisans même de ceux qui font profession des arts les plus nobles j'en pourrois citer plusieurs exemples en France comme ailleurs  An Italian writer of our own time Francesco Milisia who has published an entertaining and successful History of Architects ancient and modern speaks of Daedalus in his architectural character and repeats  in brief but energetic terms his visionary crime  Fra' suoi allievi si contraddistinse un suo nipote da alcuni detto calo da altri attalo il quale invento tra le altre cose la sega e'l compasso ma Dedalo ne concepi si nera gelosia che l'uccise  Memorie degli Architetti Antichi e Moderni tomo  i  p    Parma    As I am inclined to believe that the artists of England may be less acquainted with these feelings of  nera gelosia  to use the words of the Italian whom I have quoted than the more impassioned natives of France and Italy I hope they will approve my endeavour to vindicate from the horrible imputation of an envious murder their ancient brother of Athens At all events I have a pleasure in persuading myself that he was as clearly innocent as he was confessedly ingenious When he removed from Attica whatever the cause of that removal might be he is said to have obtained the friendship of Minos the second of that name who reigned in Crete and to have executed in wood two statues of Phaedra and Ariadne the celebrated daughters of the Cretan monarch In Crete he is reported to have built a labyrinth of marvellous intricacy and copied on a smaller scale from a portentous edifice of Aegypt He must have studied therefore the works of Aegyptian art in their own country before his visit to Crete The Cretans were ever remarkable for their gross deviation from truth and the narrative of some sculptural works ascribed to Daedalus in their island contains the most filthy and disgusting fable that ever sullied the pages of fiction The reader acquainted with mythology will immediately perceive that I allude to the fable of Pasiphae the most cruelly calumniated queen that ever suffered from the licentiousness of fancy Some decent interpreters of her story have supposed that she was enamoured of a Cretan officer who bore the name of Taurus and that Daedalus was employed in assisting their illicit attachment but Lucian with an admirable mixture of wit and goodnature imagines the Taurus of Pasiphae's  affection to have been merely the sign of the zodiac distinguished by that appellation and Deadalus is very happily metamorphosed by this supposition from the culpable confident of a dishonourable intrigue into an innocent master of astronomy But however blameless the intercourse might be between the slandered Pasiphae and the ingenious Athenian Daedalus appears to have incurred the resentment of the Cretan monarch and to have been under the necessity of escaping from his dominion with secret rapidity Hence arose the fable of his inventing wings for himself and his son Icarus a fable so captivating to the fancy of the Latin poets that Ovid has related it twice at considerable length  Metamorph lib viii Artis Amatoriae libii  Virgil has embellished it in a few verses of singular delicacy and pathos Horace Silius Italicus and Ausonius have all mentioned it occasionally The ancient and sensible interpreter of incredible fictions Palaephatus has turned the fabulous wings of Daedalus and his son into sails He asserts that being imprisoned by Minos they escaped from a window of their prison and embarked in a skiff but being pursued by the vessels of Minos in tempestuous weather the father only got safe to land and completed his escape Apollodorus relates that Hercules found the body of Icarus cast ashore upon an island to which he gave the name of Icaria in honour of the youth whom he buried The same author adds that Daedalus rewarded his illustrious friend for this humanity shewn to his unfortunate child by executing a statue of Hercules which that hero mistaking in the night for a living figure is said to have struck with a stone Pausanias mentions this statue as preserved by the Thebans in a temple of Hercules and gives a similar account of its origin as a tribute of gratitude from the afflicted father whose escape from Crete he also ascribes like Palaephatus to the use of sails Though Virgil and Silius Italicus represent Daedalus as building the temple of the Cumaean Apollo immediately  after his escape from the tyranny of Minos the Greek historian of his adventures supposes him to have proceeded from Crete to Sicily and to have ingratiated himself so successfully with Cocalus a prince of that country that when Minos with a naval force pursued and demanded the fugitive his generous protector instead of betraying his ingenious guest from whose architectural talents he is said to have derived great advantage endeavoured to negotiate with Minos in his favour The Cretan monarch accepted the invitation of the Sicilian prince and according to the accounts of more than one ancient Greek author the daughters of Cocalus contrived from their partiality to the Athenian artist to destroy his formidable enemy which they are said to have accomplished by the means of a hot bath in such a manner that the Cretans who attended their king supposed his death to be natural and departed in peace with his remainsa tale that has much the appearance of fiction  Daedalus is reported to have expressed his gratitude towards his Sicilian protector by executing many ingenious works in his country Diodorus relates that he built an impregnable palace for his royal friend that he fortified and adorned the temple of Venus Erycina and that he constructed a vapourbath in which the sick were pleasantly cured of their infirmities without suffering from its heat    DIODORUS SICULUS lib  A curious proof of the antiquity and excellence of vapourbaths  Concerning the latter days and death of Daedalus antiquity furnishes no anecdotes but the learned Abbé Gedoyn imagines with great probability that from Italy he passed again into Aegypt and ended his life in that countryan idea that he rests on the authority of the Aegyptian priests who reported according to the narrative of Diodorus Siculus that Daedalus constructed a most beautiful vestibule to the  temple of Vulcan at Memphis and was held in such veneration by the Aegyptians that they placed in that temple a statue which he had carved in wood of himself and raised in one of the adjacent islands a temple to the artist in which his memory was religiously worshipped by the natives of that country  Thus incomplete are the best accounts that ancient and modern authors afford of this extraordinary and interesting personage whose existence like that of Prometheus and Semiramis has been questioned by the scrutinizing spirit of modern refinement A very ingenious and learned French commentator on Pliny who seems actuated like Mr Bryant by a passion for etymological chemistry would reduce the active Athenian artist into a mere Syrian symbol  Daedale est un nom Syrien dont les racines se retrouvent dans les deux mots Hebreux  dai  preposition qui de même que  da  en Grec augmente le seus du mot qu'elle précede et  dal  pauvre Daedale est done l'emblême de la pauvretè du besoin première source necessaire des artsOn reconnoit manifestement le genie oriental dans cette fiction morase  M POINSINET DE SIVRY in a note to his splendid and elaborate edition of Pliny in Latin and French twelve vols quarto  It is remarkable that Pliny does not mention the elder Daedalus as a sculptor but celebrates him as the inventor of the saw the hatchet the level the gimblet isinglas and glue  But presuming on the evidence of several works very credibly imputed to this early sculptor that he really existed and presuming this with the more confidence because one of his works has the happy and immortal distinction of being described by Homer I shall proceed to enumerate those memorable productions in Sculpture which antiquity assigned to him and which the course of this narrative has not yet led me to mention Of these the most striking are two statues of himself and his son Icarus the one formed of tin the other of brass and said to have been stationed in those islands of the Adriatic gulf that were called Electrides    STEPHANUS BYZANTINUS De Urbibus edit p    Aristotle from whom Stephanus of Byzantium borrowed his account of these questionable statues has mentioned Daedalus as a maker of puppets that moved by an infusion of quicksilver an idea that D'Hancarville has ridiculed with contemptuous pleasantry  Sur le temoignage d'un certain Philippe Aristote plus de neuf cents ans après Dedale assuroit qu'au moyen du vif argent il fit une statue qui marchoit effectivement Beaucoup d'auteurs malheureusement trèsgraves Dion Chrysostome entr'autres copierent cette fable et suivant l'usage l'appuyèrent de leur autorité je les croirois plus volontiers s'ils eussent écrit que Dedale fit des automates philosophes capables d'écrire seriusement de tels contes ils serviroient euxmêmes de justification à ma croyance  Pausanias records with particular care the more authentic works of Daedalus that remained in his time his statue of Hercules at Thebes of Trophonius among the Lebadenses in Boeotia those of Britomartis and of Minerva in Crete with the dance of Ariadne mentioned by Homer in the Iliad and wrought on white marble among the Delians a Venus in wood with her right hand perishing by Time and raised on a square basis instead of feet "I am persuaded" says Pausanias  that Ariadne received this image from Daedalus and carried it with her when she attended Theseus The Delians affirm that Theseus himself devoted it to their Apollo that it might not on his return to his own country awaken in his mind a painful and passionate recollection of Ariadne Besides these  concludes Pausanias  I know not any works of Daedalus remaining for as to those which the Argives had consecrated in their temple of Juno and those removed to Gela in Sicily from Omphace they have disappeared by the influence of Time  Pausanias in a former part of his description had mentioned another statue of Hercules by the same artist executed also in wood and  placed near a temple of Minerva in the territory of Corinth This statue described as naked may be therefore considered as the source of the fashion that prevailed in the heroic images of Greece and Pausanias in his account of it delivers his opinion on the works of Daedalus in general They did not satisfy the sight accustomed to the productions of improved art yet they had in them an air of inspiration    PAUSANIAS p    From this candid account a modern reader may easily conceive the kind of deficiency and the degree of animation that were visible in the statues of this early artist His extraordinary skill as a sculptor seems to rest on his marble basrelief representing the Dance of Ariadne I shall therefore close this long yet imperfect note on the father of Grecian art by transcribing the description which Homer has given of his most memorable work with the lively remarks of D'Hancarville on this ancient and interesting sculpture  Homer in describing the shield of Achilles pays the following tribute to the merit of Daedalus          Iliad v  A figur'd dance succeeds Such once was seen  In lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen  Form'd by Daedalean art A comely band  Of youths and maidens bounding hand in hand  The maids in soft cymars of linen dress'd  The youths all graceful in the glossy vest  Of those the locks with flowery wreaths inroll'd  Of these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold  That glittering gay from silver belts depend  Now all at once they rise at once descend  With welltaught feet now shape in oblique ways  Confusedly regular the moving maze  Now forth at once too swift for sight they spring  And undistinguish'd blend the flying ring  So whirls a wheel in giddy circle toss'd  And rapid as it runs the single spokes are lost  The gazing multitudes admire around  Two active tumblers in the centre bound  Now high now low their pliant limbs they bend  And general songs the sprightly revel end  POPE  The recent version of my admirable friend which he has lately and happily retouched is more faithful to Homer and to Daedalus  To these the glorious artist added next  A varied dance resembling that of old  In Crete's broad isle by Daedalus compos'd  For brighthair'd Ariadne There the youths  And youthalluring maidens hand in hand  Danc'd jocund every maiden neatattir'd  In finest linen and the youths in vests  Wellwoven glossy as the glaze of oil  These all wore garlands and bright faulchions those  Of burnish'd gold in silver trappings hung  They with welltutor'd steps now nimbly ran  The circle swift as when before his wheel  Seated the potter twirls it with both hands  For trial of its speed now crossing quick  They pass'd at once into each other's place  A circling crowd survey'd the lovely dance  Delighted two the leading pair their heads  With graceful inclination bowing oft  Pass'd swift between them and began the song  COWPER  Cet ouvrage de sculpture executé près de cinq cents ans après l'invention de la statuaire decrit environ trois siècles après Dedale par Homere qui l'avoit assurement vu puisque Pausanias plus de mille ans depuis reconnoit que c'est le même dont il est parlé dans l'Iliade à laquelle curieux observateur et savant comme il étoit il n'avoit sans doubte pas manqué de le comparer car il l'avoit si bien examiné qu'il specifie même la matière dont il étoit fait un tel monument  disje détaillé par un homme tel qu' Homère dont on connoit l'exactitude dans les moindres details où il entre sur les arts est sans doubte la preuve la plus authentique qui puisse jamais exister des grands progrès faits par la sculpture au moins cent ans avant la prise de Troye et de l'erreur dans laquelle le peu de critique des anciens mais surtout de Pline a jetté les modernes au sujet de l'ancienneté des artsCe bas rélief représentant deux tems d'une même action étoit nécessairement divisé en deux parties ou par une vase on par une colonne comme on en a plusieurs exemples dans les monumens antiques Le premier de ces tableaux représentoit le commencement de la danse qui se mouvoit en cercle comme pour s'essayer le Coryphée avec sa compagne entonnoit la chanson qui en étoit le motif et que le reste des danseurs répétoit Par les plis et replis de la figure qu'ils formoient ils marquoient dans le second tableau les tours et les détours du labyrinthe d'ou Thésée sortit au moyen du fil dont Ariane l'avoit pourvu Dédale au rapport de Lucien l'avoit instruite de cette danse et suivant Homère il en étoit l'inventeur C'est le plus ancien ballet figuré dont il foit parlé dans les anciens auteurs il fût le modèle de tous ceux qui représenterent depuis les actions et les moeurs des hommes cet art si l'on en croit Plutarque fût porté si loin qu'il approchoit plus de la poesie que la peinture même  Il paroit que les draperies des figures de ce basrelief colorées sur le bouclier d'Achille à l'aide des differens métaux qu'on y suppose employés l'étoient auffi sur le marbre dela vient cette expression  pour marquer un choeur de diverses couleurs Nous avons déjà parlé des statues de bois peintes et dorées faites avant Dédale mais les anciens colorerent aussi et dorérent le marbre comme on le peut voir par la petite Isis trouvée à Pompeia par la Diane conservée à Portici par les cheveux de la belle Vénus de Medicis et le diademe  de l'autre Vénus conservée avec la première dans la tribune de la galerie de Florence Je crois donc que les robes de lin et de laine que portoient les danseuses et les danseurs de ce basrelief étoient peintes que les ceinturons de ces derniers étoient argentés et que leurs epées étoient dorées  Si l'on compare ce que dit Homère de ce monument avec ce que Pausanias et Platon ont écrit des autres ouvrages de Dédale on verra que la composition de cette danse ne pouvoit être mieux entendue ni plus riche ou plus agréable qu'elle l'étoit elle semble avoir donné l'idée des heures que l'on voit à la vigne Borghèse et de celles dont le Guide a entouré le char de l'Aurore qu'il a peinte dans le palais Rospigliozi à Rome Cependant on n'exécute jamais tout ce que l'on concoit parceque l'habilité de la main la connoissance des vrais principes de l'art et des moyens qu'il peut employer ne répondent pas toujours à la grandeur du génie et des idées de celui qui compose si l'on s'en rapporte au jugement de Pausanias sur le caractère des statues de Dédale on trouvera que l'exécution de ce basrelief a dû être inférieure à sa composition que le style quoique fort et vigoreux en dévoit être austère et privé de grace si toutefois l'on s'en rapporte à Platon il foudra croire que les figures employées à rendre ces belles idées manquoient encore par l'exactitude du dessin et sans doubte par la justesse des proportions mais il est assuré que l'on y voyoit les semences de tout ce que la sculpture fit de mieux dans les tems postérieurs Homère qui s'il se fût adonné à la sculpture ou à la peinture eût assurement été aussi habile sculpteur ou peintre qu'il étoit grand poete nous a dessiné plutôt que décrit ce basrelief avec route la vérité et la simplicité qu'eût jamais pu y mettre le plus savant artiste en le rendant sur le toile ou sur le marbre On croit le voir en lisant la copie qu'il en a faite la matière seule en est détruite mais il nous en a conservé la partie la plus precieuse ses vers  comme autant de pinceaux donnent à la nature ce coloris et cette fraicheur qui la rendent si aimable Il faut donc que malgré les reproches faits à Dédale Homère ait trouvé dans son ouvrage ce gout et ce sentiment qui seuls sont capables d'echauffer l'imagination parcequ'ils touchent le coeur peuvent inspirer des idées riantes à l'esprit par le souvenir des choses agréables qu'ils lui rappellent et fournir à tous deux les images charmantes dont il a fait usage  Antiquités Etrusques Grecques et Romaines  tom iii p  I have transcribed these copious remarks because they seem to place in a very fair and judicious point of view the merits of the early sculptor whose obscure history I have wished to illustrate With such a desire I have particularly to regret one of the lost comedies ascribed to Aristophanes which bore the name of Daedalus yet it is possible that such a composition might not have afforded that clear light concerning the life and character of the artist which we might eagerly expect from its title As it was the favourite amusement of Aristophanes to ridicule the tragic poets of his country perhaps his Daedalus contained little more than a ludicrous parody on the Prometheus of Aeschylus However this might be the name of Daedalus appears to have been generally honoured by the poets of Greece and I hasten to conclude this attempt to elucidate and confirm his reputation with the words of a Greek epigram that represent him as a paragon of excellence      Momus will scoff at art in every shape  Nor could her hero Daedalus escape  There were two subsequent artists of considerable eminence who bore the name of Daedalus The first a native of Sicyon acquired celebrity by many statues that are mentioned by Pliny and Pausanias The latter was probably a Bithynian as he is supposed to have executed at Nicomedia a wonderful image of Jupiter the patron of armies  EUSTATHIUS apud Junium    The learned Abbé Barthelemy says in a note to his elaborate and lively travels of Anacharsis  Je ne nie pas l'existence d'un Dédale très ancien Je dis seulement que les premiers progrés de la sculpture doivent être attribués à celui de Sicyone  Tom iii p  I am sorry to differ from so accomplished a judge of antiquity but I consider the sculptural merit of the elder Daedalus as completely proved by the testimony of Homer The works of Endaeus the Athenian disciple of this early artist are mentioned by Athenagoras and Pausanias The latter seems to have examined the works of Endaeus with peculiar attention  NOTE XII Ver  And from oblivion sav'd the artist and the bard  Although the Lacedaemonians were so little attached to the pacific and elegant pursuits of life that according to a bold expression of Isocrates concerning them they were hardly acquainted with their letters yet they seem to have paid particular regard to the art of sculpture Pausanias with his usual accuracy has recorded that this early and accomplished artist Gitiadas whom he celebrates for the variety of his talents was a native of Sparta    PAUSANIAS p  The minute and intelligent  describer of his sculptural works speaks highly of the figures that he executed in brass particularly those of Neptune and Amphitrite That the Lacedemonians had a strong passion for sculpture seems evident from the magnificence of their Amyclaean Apollo whose throne was decorated by Bathycles an artist of Magnesia and comprised as M de Caylus has justly observed an epitome of ancient mythology Winkelman supposes Bathycles to have lived in the age of Solon One singular advantage which the Spartans expected to derive from the possession of fine statues was to improve the beauty of their offspring a source of their partiality both to sculpture and to painting which Junius has explained in the following passage  Lacedaemonii quondam in reliquis horridiores pulcherrimas quasque picturas in summo semper habuerunt pretio dicuntur enim de liberorum suorum pulchritudine tantopere solliciti fuisse ut formosissimorum adolescentium Nirei Narcissi Hiacinthi Castoris et Pollucis deorumque speciosissimorum Apollinis nempe ac Bacchi effigies gravidis uxoribus repraesentarent  JUNIUS  de Pictura Veterum  p  On the works of Gitiadas which consisted of brazen basreliefs in the temple of the Spartan Minerva D'Hancarville has made the following judicious remark  La sculpture dans les ouvrages de Gitiadas étoit aussi avancée que l'étoit la peinture dans ceux d'Helotas faits peu avant lui suivant le rapport de Pline cet art étoit par consequent arrivé en Grèce au point où il parvint en Italie quand Laurent Ghiberti fit en bronze les admirables basreliefs des portes du baptistaire de Florence et par une singularité remarquable les arts firent dans ces deux pays les mêmes progrés en des tems àpeuprès egaux  Gitiadas according to probable conjecture lived in the age of Romulus  NOTE XIII Ver  Where haste insulted his unfinish'd toil  Dipaenus and Scyllis are usually mentioned together as brothers and associates in their art which they learnt from Daedalus Some authors according to Pausanias supposed them to be his sons The most striking part of their history is contained in the following passage of Pliny  Marmore scalpendo primi omnium inclaruerunt Dipaenus et Scyllis geniti in Creta insula etiamnum Medis imperantibus priusque quam Cyrus in Persis regnare inciperet hoc est Olympiade circiter L Ii Sicyonem se contulere quae diu fuit officinarum omnium metallorum patria Deorum quorundam simulacra publice locaverant Sicyonii quae priusquam absolverentur artifices injuriam questi abierunt in Aetolos Protinus Sicyonios infanda invasit sterilitas moerorque dirus Remedium petentibus Apollo Pythius affuturum respondit si Dipaenus et Scyllus deorum simulacra perfecissent quod magnis mercedibus obsequiisque impetratum est Fuere autem simulacra ea Apollinis Dianae Herculis Minervae quod e coelo postea tactum est  PLIN lib c  Cedrenus has described a very curious Minerva supposed to be the work of these fraternal artists as preserved at Constantinople    CEDRENUS p edit Venet  NOTE XIV Ver  And blam'd the mean abuse of mental power  Anthermus a sculptor in the island of Chios had two sons of his own profession Bupalus and Athenis The brothers became famous by works of considerable merit in their art and still more so by their degrading it into an instrument of malevolence against the poet Hipponax This animated but illfavoured bard distinguished by mental talents and personal deformity is supposed to have been in love with the daughter of Bupalus who to prevent a connexion that he disliked is said to have exhibited a caricatura of the formidable lover The exasperated poet retaliated by a satire of such severity against the offending sculptors that according to tradition it made them frantic and impelled them to suicidea story which as Pliny justly observes upon it was sufficiently refuted by their subsequent productions  Their caricature of Hipponax perhaps the first caricature upon record is supposed by D'Hancarville to have suggested to Thespis their contemporary the idea of furnishing his actors with a mask instead of colouring their faces with vermilion The satire of the vindictive poet though we may hope it did not produce the horrible effect ascribed to it appears to have given celebrity to its indignant author The Greek Anthologia contains no less than four inscriptions on this powerful satirist I have selected the two best of them for the amusement of my reader        Grotii Versio  Quam potes hinc tacitus transi ne forte crabronem  Expergefacias quem sopor altus habet  Hipponactis enim quae natos saeva latravit  Ira suos multa nunc cubat in requie  Sed cave nunc etiam sodes ex ipsius aula  Ditis adhuc laedunt ignea dicta viri  Leonidas on Hipponax  Glide gently by this tomb for quiet's sake  Lest you the bitter sleeping hornet wake  For he whose gibes against his parents glanc'd  Here now the keen Hipponax lies entranc'd  Beware for still his fiery words may flow  And wound with rancour in the shades

Hipponax lie  Hence from his grave if wicked fly  Here rest if thou in life art pure  And if thou wish it sleep secure  Hipponax was a native of Ephesus and he is celebrated by Athenaeus as the inventor of parody but his title to that invention is in some measure controverted by the Abbé Sallier in his Dissertation on the Origin and Character of Parody in the Memoirs of the French Academy Bayle has an article on Hipponax in which he has collected many curious examples of persons who have suffered from the dangerous severity of literary vengeance The enmity between the sculptor of Chios and the Ephesian satirist will probably recall to the recollection of  an English reader the similar enmity between those bitter and powerful antagonists Hogarth and Churchill  From the slight fragments that remain of Hipponax I am inclined to believe that his Satires celebrated as they have been were inferior in genius and perhaps in acrimony to the vindictive performance of the English poet which contains so many beautiful passages beautiful both in sentiment and expression that although goodnature must wish the quarrel which produced it had never existed the poem is still admirable as a masterpiece of poetical indignation  NOTE XV Ver  Whose very silence cried aloud "Be free"  The passion of the Greeks for liberty was at once proclaimed and nourished by the various honours which they paid to the memory of Harmodius and Aristogiton  These celebrated young friends had perished in their perilous exploit of delivering Athens from the tyranny of Hipparchus but the grateful Athenians revered them as the restorers of freedom and according to the animated expressions of Demosthenes in their praise the veneration which they received from public gratitude was equal to that of heroes and of gods The four statuaries Antenor Critias Antigonus and Praxiteles had distinguished themselves at different periods in executing the statues of these favourite public characters Pliny relates that this work of Praxiteles was carried off by Xerxes in the plunder of Athens and restored to that city by Alexander the Great after his conquest of Persia Arrian appears so much pleased with this munificence of his  hero to Athens that he has mentioned the restitution of these interesting statues in two different passages of his History and exultingly says in his account of them "they are now in the Ceramicus    ARRIAN de Expedit Alexandri lib iii  " Pausanias asserts that the statues were restored to Athens by Antiochus and Valerius Maximus ascribes the honour of their restitution to Seleucus These contradictory accounts may be reconciled if we recollect that many statues were executed of these idolized martyrs to freedom and as it is probable that several of these were carried out of their country by the Persian plunderers the honour of their restitution might of course be truly ascribed to more than one victorious friend to the arts and monuments of Greece Sculpture and Poetry seem to have vied with each other in their endeavours to immortalize these young tyrannicides The Athenian song of Harmodius is proverbially famous and its potent enthusiasm is thus forcibly described by our learned and eloquent Lowth in his admirable Praelectiones  Tam vehemens tamque animosum poeseos genus permultum habuisse momenti necesse est in hominum mentibus cum ad omnem honestatem erigendis tum a scelere absterrendis maxime vero in fovendo et sustentando illo vigore animi atque generosa  quae libertatis et alumna est eadem et custos Num verendum erat ne quis tyrannidem Pisistratidarum Athenis instaurare auderet ubi in omnibus conviviis et aeque ab infima plebe in compitis quotidie cantitaretur  illud Callistrati nescio cujus sed ingeniosi certe poetae et

partibus deque denominatione Caesarum plus mehercule valuisset unum  quam Ciceronis Philippicae omnes  LOWTH  Praelectiones  edit oct p  To return to the brazen statuesThey gave rise to a very spirited but dangerous repartee of Antiphon who being asked by the tyrant Dionysius what kind of brass was esteemed the best replied  That which forms the statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton  NOTE XVI Ver  The future sunshine of a fairer hour  Among the infinite number of interesting personal anecdotes which the history of ancient sculpture displays there are hardly any more pleasing to the fancy or more calculated to exhibit the Grecian character in a favourable point of view than the anecdotes preserved by Pausanias concerning the Athenian women and their children who having found a friendly refuge in the walls of Traezene when the Persian invasion reduced them to the necessity of flying from their native city had their statues erected in a portico of the Traezenian Forum I presume that these statues were a present from the people of Athens They were such memorials as every patriot of Greece must have contemplated with peculiar delight they were graceful monuments of Grecian courage benevolence and gratitude  The Traezenians probably took infinite pride in these public ornaments of their city for they are described by Pausanias as a people who delighted in every circumstance that reflected honour on the spot they inhabited    PAUSANIAS p    END OF THE NOTES ON THE SECOND EPISTLE  NOTES ON THE  THIRD EPISTLE  NOTE I Ver  A THIRST for praise and panting for the goal  I follow the authority of Cicero Vitruvius and Quintilian in naming Myron as the earliest of the more accomplished Grecian sculptors who acquired infinite celebrity by making near approaches to perfection in their art Pausanias speaks of Myron as an Athenian but Pliny affirms that he was born at Eleutherae a city of Baeotia and a disciple of Agelades an artist of Argos The Bacchus of Myron is said by Pausanias to have excelled all his other productions except his statue of Erectheus at Athens but this very diligent artist appears to have executed many works of considerable excellence and to have been most commended for what he probably regarded as a trifling performance I allude to his famous heifer of brass celebrated by no less than thirtysix epigrams in the Greek Anthologia upon which the French sculptor  Falconet says with some pleasantry and some justice  Les Atheniens étoient les François de la Grèce et devoient faire autant de jolis vers sur un vache que nous en avons faits sur la chatte en sculpture de Madame de Lesdiguières  Traduction des et Livres de Pline avec des Notes par Etienne Falconet tom i p    I ought however to observe for the credit of Athens that these epigrams are far from having been all produced by her citizens They form altogether such a heap of insipid compliments as would not I think have appeared very flattering to an artist of Attic genius The following I believe is one of the best of them      Grotii Versio  Aut superinducta est isti cutis aenea vaccae  Aut aes hoc animam quae movet intus habet  Either this heifer has a brazen skin  Or else the brass contains a soul within  Myron whose Discobolos proved how successfully he had studied the human figure could he have heard and understood the judicious language  in which Quintilian has mentioned that elaborate statue  Quid tam distortum et elaboratum quam est ille Discobolos Myronis Si quis tamen ut parum rectum improbet opus nonne is ab intellectu artis absuerit in qua vel praecipue laudabilis est illa ipsa novitas et difficultas  QUINTILIAN lib c  would have been more gratified perhaps by the praise of the Latin critic than by all the Greek epigrams on his heifer This remark cannot be extended to Pliny who has described the works of Myron as rather deficient in expression an opinion which Falconet pronounces to be an egregious mistake if the antique head of Jupiter that was stationed in the garden of Versailles and ascribed to Myron is in truth a performance of this celebrated artist Though I am generally disposed to take the part of Pliny against the pert malevolence with which the lively and keen Falconet has attacked and derided his opinions I must confess that I think the respectable connoisseur of ancient Rome mistaken in the present point and his mistake appears sufficiently proved by the following animated Greek verses on the Ladas of Myron a statue which if the poet who describes it may be trusted was surely a masterpiece of  expression            Grotii Versio  Qualis eras Lada fugiens vestigia Thymi  Alipedis premeres cum pede flabra tuo  Nobilis ad Pisae contendens praemia talem  Corpore te toto fecit in aere Myron  Implet eum spes quanta vides et anhelitus ore  Cernitur ex imis ilibus exoriens  Prosiliet mox aes ad serta nec ipsa tenebit  Credo basis citus est spiritus ars citior  Anonymous on a FootRacer  Such as when foremost in the race you were  And seem'd to bound upon the buoyant air  Such Ladas here by Myron's skill you breathe  Ardent in all your frame for Pisa's wreath  The fervid spirit from the heaving chest  Shines in the lips Where is not hope express'd  The brass springs forward in the nimble strife  Oh Art more vivid than the breath of life  I have sometimes thought that a new and more expressive reading might be introduced in the second line of this Greek epigram thus    but I submit the fancied emendation to those readers who are particularly familiar with the most admirable of languages If they approve the slight change in the orthography which makes a considerable difference in the sense I would alter the English version of the couplet in the following manner  Such as when flying with the whirlwind's haste  In your foot's point your eager soul you plac'd c  Myron like other Greek artists indulged his fancy in some works of supernatural magnitude and in some of extreme minuteness  Strabo has recorded that the island of Samos contained three colossal divinities by Myron on one basis Antony seized the whole groupe but Augustus restored two of them Hercules and Minerva to their original station reserving the third a Jupiter to adorn the Capitol    STRABO p  As to the minuter works of Myron Pliny has mentioned his monument of a grasshopper as celebrated in the verses of the poetess Erinna a  lusus  of art executed probably to please some fanciful fair to whom the sculptor might be tenderly attached The lovers of sculpture must lament that an artist of such merit and celebrity had the misfortune of ending his days in deplorable indigence as Junius with too much probability supposes him to have done from the following passage of Petronius Arbiter  Myron qui pene hominum animas ferarum que aere comprehenderat non invenit haeredem  NOTE II Ver  The Amazon of Phidias yields to thine  Polycletus who obtained this singular triumph was a native of Sicyon and a fellowstudent with Myron under the same master Agelades We are indebted to Pliny for this interesting account of a contest for preeminence in beauty among the sculptured Amazons executed by artists of different periods and consecrated in the temple of the Ephesian  Diana He says that the artists who were present adjudged the point by declaring which statue each artist esteemed as second to his own by this ingenious mode of decision Polycletus ranked as the first of the rival sculptors Phidias the second Ctesilas the third Cydon the fourth and Phragmon the fifth  Venere autem et in certamen laudatissimi quanquam diversis aetatibus geniti quoniam fecerant Amazonas quae cum in templo Ephesiae Dianae dicarentur placuit eligi probatissimam ipsorum artificum qui praesentes erant judicio cum apparuit eam esse quam omnes secundam a sua quisque judicassent Haec est Polycleti proxima ab ea Phidiae tertia Ctesilae quarta Cydonis quinta Phragnonis  PLIN lib c  The modern French sculptor Falconet exults in this anecdote as a proof of his favourite maxim  Que le peintre et le statuaire sont de meilleurs juges des productions de leur art que le public même éclairé sur d'autres matières  As to the general merit of Polycletus the words of the intelligent Strabo give a very high idea of it where he says that the statues of this artist were in technical excellence most beautiful but in high finishing and magnificence inferior to those of Phidias    STRABO p    Cicero has also mentioned the works of Polycletus as examples of perfection  Nondum Myronis satis ad veritatem adducta jam tamen quae non dubites pulchra dicere Pulchriora etiam Polycleti et jam plane perfecta ut mihi quidem videri solet  In his orations against Verres the Roman orator expatiates on the extreme beauty of two bronze figures the celebrated Canephorae of Polycletus and Winkelman in his Monumenti inediti No has engraved from a basrelief in terracotta two Athenian virgins that he supposes to have been copied from these favourite statues  But the most considerable performance of Polycletus was his Juno of Argos or rather of Mycenae according to the local description which Strabo has given of her temple This admired statue is described by  Pausanias as a grand sitting figure of ivory and gold adorned with a crown on which the Graces and the Hours were represented The majestic image is also celebrated in the following Greek epigram      Grotii Versio  Unus Junonem vidit Polycletus ab Argis  Et nobis quantum viderat arte dedit  Et decora ostendit quae fas modo caetera nam quae  Veste latens soli sunt ea nota Jovi  Parmenio on the Statue of Juno  The Argive Polyclete alone survey'd  Juno and such as he beheld pourtray'd  The charms that man might view his art express'd  No eyes but those of Jove command the rest  The reputation of Polycletus seems to have been much extended by a Treatise on Proportion illustrated by a statue regarded as a model of perfect symmetry and said to have been studied as such in a later period by Lysippus Many writers have mentioned this remarkable  statue but the most satisfactory account of it is contained in a passage of Galen quoted by Junius which expressly says that it was designed to confirm those principles of art which the sculptor taught in writing upon symmetry and that both his treatise and his statue were distinguished by a common name "The canon of Polycletus    GALENUS apud Junium in Catalogo Artificum p  " D'Hancarville in the following passage points out a mode of recovering the lost theory of the Grecian artist  Ces Commentaires de Polyclete malheureusement perdus aujourdhui ayant été regardés autrefois comme la regle constamment suivie depuis son tems jusqu'à celui des Antonins Menechme Xenocrates Apelles qui vécurent dans cet intervalle ayant composé différens ouvrages sur les raisons de l'art on ne peut douter qu'il n'aient contenu les principes de Polyclete sur les symmétries et nous les y retrouverions si le tems n'eût pas détruit ces écrits Mais comme à son imitation les plus habiles artistes de l'antiquité firent leurs statues d'après les regles établies dans ses livres nous pouvons retrouver dans les plus belles statues antiques les proportions qu'il enseignoit devoir y entrer et juger d'après ces proportions sur quoi se fondoit la théorie des principes renfermés dans les ouvrages des anciens sur les  symmetries  et la  beauté idèale  The author pursues his idea in discussing proportions relating to the face collected by Mengs and cited by Winkelman from the finest specimens of ancient sculpture Into the minutiae of such a discussion the intent of this work does not lead me to enter He draws an inference from these researches which I confess myself unwilling to allow for he says  Quand les anciens arrivèrent à la decouverte des proportions convenables à la  beauté ideale  leur analogie avec les proportions  harmoniques  servit à prouver qu'ils avoient incontestablement atteint au but de l'art et l'impossibilité de trouver une beauté supérieure à celle qui résulta de ses proportions elle nous sert maintenant à demontrer que l'art des Grecs ne peut eh aucun tems ni en aucun lieu ni par aucun moyen être surpassé  Antiquités Etrusques Grecques et Romaines tom iv p    With an enthusiastic esteem and admiration for the excellence of the Greeks in art and in literature the moderns ought to cherish a persuasion that even that excellence great as it is may possibly be surpassed Such an idea may be censured as presumptuous but in every arduous pursuit a degree of presumption is the very source of success Reason and fancy may unite in refusing to believe that in cultivating the fine arts any nation or any individual has yet arrived at the utmost limits of attainable perfection In sculpture indeed it is not very probable that any modern artist in any part of the globe may possess all the advantages to lead him to excellence which the sculptors of antiquity possessed yet the modern may avail himself of some advantages to which the ancient was a stranger But I forbear to enter on a topic which may be more properly discussed when modern art is the immediate subject before usI return to Polycletus  Winkelman has styled him a sublime poet in his art and he seems indeed to have enjoyed that rare mixture of industry confidence and imagination which is so favourable to felicity in the works of his profession  Aelian has related the following anecdote to shew how successfully he corrected the temerity of popular criticism  Polycletus executed two statues at the same time gratifying in the one the caprice of the crowd in the other adhering to the rules of art He gratified the multitude in this manner According to the suggestion of all his visitors he retouched and altered something in conformity to the opinion of each At last he produced his two figures the one was universally admired the other derided "Yet this" said Polycletus "which you condemn is your own work and the other which you admire is mine    AELIAN Var Hist lib xiv c  "  It is recorded of this excellent sculptor that he excelled also as an architect and Pausanias extols the temple of Aesculapius which he built for the Epidaurians as surpassing in harmonious beauty all the magnificent structures of the Romans I shall close my imperfect account of this accomplished artist with the Greek epigram on his statue of Polyxena            Grotii Versio  Iste tuus labor est Polyclete Polyxena sensit  Non aliam felix ista tabella manum  Germanum Junonis opus cerne ut sibi prudens  Obducat rupta tegmina veste pudor  Pro vita facit illa preces in virginis udis  Est oculis quantum est de Phryge Marte super  Pollianus on the Column of Polyxena  Polyxena by Polycletus wrought  His hand alone this heavenly semblance caught  A sister to his Juno Decent care  Hides the rent vest that leaves her body bare  Wretched she prays for life and in her eyes  Lo Troy's whole war and all its trouble lies  NOTE III Ver  That Athens was eclips'd by her Olympian fane  The talents and reputation of Phidias were so great that they are allowed to form the most honourable aera in the history of art The Abbé Gedoyn has added to his history of Daedalus an account of this his most illustrious successor for the sake of displaying at once in the lives of these two memorable men the commencement and the perfection of sculpture Athens had the honour of giving birth to them  both for Phidias by the authority of Plato is proved to be an Athenian He studied under two masters of no great celebrity Agelas and Hippias but he had the advantage of having two brothers distinguished by their talents as painters and the still greater advantage of having cultivated and brought to maturity his own genius at that fortunate period when the triumphant state of his country and the magnificent spirit of Pericles afforded him a most favourable field for its exertion With what patriotic pride and delight must an Attic sculptor have exerted his powers in converting that very marble which the Persian invaders had brought with them to form a trophy of their conquest into a memorial of their defeat I allude to the Nemesis of Phidias a statue executed under these animating circumstances according to Pausanias and stationed in a temple at Rhamnus at the distance of sixty stadia from Marathona statue celebrated in the following epigram                  Grotii Versio  Me niveum vivâ lapidem de rupe cecidit  Marmoream rumpens cuspide duritiem  Persa daret cum vela notis ut fingeret ex me  De Cecropis victrix gente trophaea manus  Cladibus at Marathon postquam resonavit Eois  Perque cruore rubens aequor iere rates  Fecit Adrasteam de me gens fortis Athenae  Ulcisci solitam facta superba deam  Spes ego libratas teneo Victoria nam sum  Cecropidis Nemesis nec minus Assyriis  Theaetetus on the Rhamnusian Statue of Nemesis

vincere quam sapere  Parmenio on the same Statue  From stone that Persians for their trophy chose  A seasonable Nemesis I rose  Here my just form this happy truth imparts  Athenians triumph both in arms and arts  Phidias is said to have distinguished himself by his general knowledge and a perfect acquaintance with the laws of proportion and the principles of optics  That singular metrical compiler of anecdotes Tzetzes has related in his  Versus Politici  a professional contest between Phidias and Alcamenes in which if credit may be given to such an historian this admired  chief of Athenian sculptors ran some danger of his life from the ignorance and irritability of his judges        The rival artists contended in forming a Minerva of bronze for the city The most beautiful figure was to be chosen and stationed on a lofty column The two statues were produced That of Alcamenes was immediately admired for its delicacy and the work of Phidias appeared so disgusting to the people from its open lips and distended nostrils that its author was in some danger of being stoned to death by popular indignation          TZETZES chil  but when the rival goddesses were raised to their intended height Alcamenes became the jest and Phidias the favourite of the people  Such is the amusing story of Tzetzes What degree of serious credit it may deserve I leave to the judgment of my reader and hasten to notice the two most celebrated works of Phidias his more magnificent Minerva stationed as the patroness of Athens in her temple called Parthenon and the statue extolled as the masterpiece of antiquity his Olympian Jupiter at Elis  Pausanias describes this Minerva as an upright figure with a garment descending to her feet He does not mention her height but M de Caylus from the expression of Pliny cubitorum viginti sex estimates it at thirtynine feet of the French measure  The costly splendor of the statue  says Winkelman  may be conceived from the quantity of gold employed in its decoration This as we learn from a  speech of Pericles preserved in Thucydides amounted to forty talents the drapery was of gold and the uncovered parts of the figure formed of ivory  The latter material was also employed in the head of Medusa that appeared on the breast of the goddess according to the description of Pausanias and perhaps gold and ivory were united in the image of Victory of four cubits that was placed in one of her hands though its position is not ascertained by Pausanias who only says that in her hand she held a spear But the smaller figure of Victory that was frequently added as a decoration to a colossal statue and displayed in the extended hand of the triumphant divinity was sometimes of solid gold as we may conjecture from the profane jest of Dionysius the tyrant of Syracuse who in stealing such figures said it would be folly not to take from the gods what they appeared to offer But to return to the Minerva of Phidias Pliny says that on the prominent side of her shield the battle of the Amazons was represented and in the concave part the conflict between the giants and the gods Nay even her sandals were decorated according to his account with the battle of the Centaurs and the Lapithae  M de Caylus has ventured to criticise with a becoming spirit these minute decorations  Après avoir remercié Pline de nous avoir conservé ces details qui ne se trouvent dans aucun autre auteur on' me trouvëra sans doute hardi et peutêtre temeraire d'oser desapprouver ces petits ouvrages en euxmêmes Je ne doute pointe assurement de leur mérite et de leur perfection mais je dirai franchement que sans parler de l'interieur du bouclier dont je laisse à juger pour la possibilité du coupd'oeil ces beaux details étoient en pure perte car il est constant qu'il n'auroit pas été possible de les distinguer quand meme la figure auroit été de grandeur naturelle Mais quoique le bouclier pût avoir dix pieds de diametre on ne pouvoit examiner ses ornemens assez  près en quelque endroit qu'il ait été placé pour en juger sainement sur une figure d'environ quarante pieds de proportion d'autant qu'elle étoit placée sur un piédestal qui l'élevoit encore tout au moins de dix ou de quinze Cette figure pour être aussi belle que toute l'antiquité l'a declarée devoit être entendue et formée par de grandes masses et ces masses devoient nécessairement absorber un aussi grand nombre de petits details Il faut convenir que les anciens paroissent les avoir aimés Cependant pour faire mieux entendre mon espèce de critique je comparerai ces petits travaux à ceux d'un peintre qui faisant le portrait d'une femme aussi grand que la nature auroit grand soin de peindre en miniature un autre portrait qu'elle auroit au bras Je demande si le travail et la disposition du grand portrait ne feroient pas absolument évanouir le mérite et l'ouvrage du brasselet Cependant il s'en faut beaucoup que la comparison soit en proportion avec le point duquel je suis parti  Cette statue de Minerve presente encore une difficulté elle étoit d'or et d'yvoire et elle avoit à ses pieds un serpent et un sphinx de bronze Quel alliage de couleurs et de matières on a peine à concevoir leur agrément  Memoires de l' Academie  tom xxv p  The sculptor Falconet who attacks without mercy the inaccuracies of Pliny and is sometimes rather petulantly severe on the respectable connoisseur of his own country whom I have just quoted yet highly commends these remarks on the Minerva of Phidias At the same time he makes a lively but a rash attempt to vindicate the Athenian artist in the following conjecture  Mais si Phidias n'a point fait ces petits ornemens s'ils n'ont été ajoutés à sa Minerve d'or et d'yvoire que plusieurs années après la mort de l'auteur que deviendra l'exactitude de Pline et de ceux qui le copient sans regarder ailleurs  Pausanias l i c dit 'Mis excellent graveur a réprésenté sur le bouclier de la déesse le combat des Centaures et des Lapithes et plusieurs autres histoires d'après les desseins de Parrhasius fils d'Evénor Cette statue est si haute que l'aigrette du casque et la pointe de la pique peuvent étre aperçues de Sunium' C'estàdire de cinque lieues d'Athènes  Le minutieux Pausanias qui ne fait grace de rien à son lecteur parle ailleurs de la Minerve du Parthénon qui étoit comme on fait dans la citadelle d'Athènes et ne dit pas un mot de toute cette ciselure gravure c dont Pline fait mention details qu'il ne manque cependant jamais d'écrire quand il en a l'occasion Ne se pourroitil pas que les deux Minerves de Phidias eussent été confondües dans la tête de l'ecrivain Latin et qu'il eut attribué à l'une ce qui apartenoit à l'autre Je suis loin de la vouloir assurer mais j'aimerois mieux Pline avec un défaut de memoire que Phidias avec un défaut de goût cela ne se compare pas  Ne seroit il pas possible encore comme il est dit plus haut qu'on eut chargé d'ornemens superflus cette Minerve de Phidias quelques années après sa mort comme on avoit fait celle de bronze Il seroit glorieux pour la memoire d'un artiste célèbre dont on nous dit le genie si grand si sublime de ne pas le voir minutieux dans son art sur tout lorsque nous pouvons soupçonner quelques présomptions du contraire  FALCONET  Traduction de Pline  tom ii p  This animated artist who is often very acrimonious in censuring the inaccuracy of respectable writers on subjects relating to his own profession has fallen himself into considerable inaccuracies in speaking of this celebrated Minerva I shall not enter into a minute discussion of these but merely observe that his conjecture concerning the figures on  the shield of the goddess is entirely overthrown by many passages from ancient authors collected by Junius to illustrate this statue  It was alleged as a crime against Phidias that he had introduced his own portrait and that of Pericles in the battle of the Amazons which formed the most striking ornament of the shield in question and Junius has cited a passage from Aristotle particularly remarkable as it displays the ingenious solicitude of the sculptor to preserve his own figure from the malignity of any one who might wish to strike it out of the group    Phidiam illum quem fictorem probum fuisse tradit memoria vidi ipse in clypeo Minervae quae arcibus Atheniensibus praesidet oris sui similitudinem ita colligasse ut si quis artificis voluisset inde imaginem separare soluta compage simulac totius incolumitas interiretSic Apulcius transtulit hunc locum desumtum ex Aristotele de Mundo  JUNIUS Catal Artif p    Plutarch considers the base attempt to ruin Phidias in the esteem of the Athenians as a political manoeuvre to try the public influence of his patron Pericles We owe to that invaluable biographer the anecdote to which I have alluded in the Poem I mean the friendly precaution of Pericles by which he protected the sculptor from the slanderous accusation of having embezzled a part of the gold consigned to him for the decoration of Minerva By the advice of his illustrious friend the artist is said to have contrived the golden habiliments of the goddess in such a manner that they might be easily removed and his probity ascertained by the infallible test of the scales  The vindication of his innocence in this important article did not secure Phidias from the insidious rancour of his enemies He was accused of alluring the chaste matrons of Athens to his house under the pretence of shewing his statues for the dishonourable purpose of gratifying the licentious passions of his patron It has been said that he  perised in prison under the popular indignation which this calumny excited but the indefatigable Meursius has proved by the authority of an old scholiast on Aristophanes that the persecuted artist escaped to Elis and ended his days with honour in a scene which he is supposed to have adorned in gratitude for the protection it afforded him with the sublimest work of sculpture that was ever produced even by Grecian talentshis Olympian Jupiter an image which he conceived according to his own ingenuous account from Homer's description of the god  Phidias Homeri versibus egregio dicto allusit simulacro enim Jovis Olympii perfecto quo nullum praestantius aut admirabilius humanae fabricae manus fecit interrogatus ab amico quonam mentem suam

note by transcribing all the animated passages in ancient authors which allude to this most memorable statue but as it may gratify my reader to have an immediate opportunity of comparing my sketch of it in rhyme with more minute descriptions in prose I will add the Greek original from Pausanias and a modern copy from the eloquent Travels of Anacharsis    PAUSANIAS p edit Kuhnii  La figure de

Callimachus is said to have expressed in Iambic verse are not preserved but from a passage in Strabo which represents the head of the sitting figure as near the roof of the temple in height sixty feet we are enabled to form some conjectures concerning its magnitude Falconet supposes that the temple and the statue were wretchedly disproportioned to each other  but the general voice of antiquity in praise of the very sublime effect which this spectacle altogether produced is sufficient to refute his supposition Livy describes this effect very forcibly in speaking of Paulus Aemilius  Olympiam

may credit an author so frequently erroneous the same city contained also a reclining Jupiter in marble by this illustrious artist    CEDRENUS p    But it is time to take leave of PhidiasLet me first observe that he sometimes used the pencil as well as the implements of sculpture and painted a portrait of his kind and powerful friend Pericles distinguished by his lofty title "the Olympian"  Cum et Phidiam ipsum initio pictorem fuisse tradatur Olympiumque Athenis ab eo pictum  PLIN lib  Pliny mentions a portrait of Pericles in bronze by the sculptor Ctesilaus with the fame appellation  Ctesilaus

public works with which the liberal ambition of Pericles delighted to decorate his country  NOTE IV Ver  Her shame his pride her ornaments his prey  How deplorable was the fate of Athens repeatedly the captive of two the most artful sanguinary and impious wretches that dishonoured the list of ancient heroesLysander and Sylla Both these barbarous conquerors had a passion for sculpture so great was the influence of that powerful art over the sternest spirits of antiquity Plutarch informs us that after Lysander had taken Athens he devoted a part of his spoil to the expence of raising his own statue and those of his officers at Delphi Yet so truly savage was this detestable victor that Plutarch rather seems to believe the report he mentions of Lysander's having proposed in the council of the allies to reduce the Athenians to slavery A Theban officer according to the same authority proposed the utter demolition of the city and Athens is said to have been saved by the happy voice of a Phocensian who sung to the conquerors at a banquet a few verses from a tragedy of Euripides which awakened their humanity and made them shrink from their horrible purpose of annihilating a city so admirable and the parent of men so illustrious  Milton alludes to this incident in the close of his th Sonnet  and the repeated air  Of sad Electra's poet had the power  To save th' Athenian walls from ruin bare  NOTE V Ver  And to new sons new excellence assign'd  Sculpture is assuredly one of the most difficult of the fine arts yet it is a striking truth that Greece produced several sculptors of the first rate though she could only boast a single Homer It is also remarkable that the Grecian sculptors were more numerous than the painters of their country That intelligent and contemplative observer of antiquity M de Caylus has had the curiosity to compare their respective numbers as far as the narratives of Pausanias and Pliny enabled him to make the comparison Of the former he says  Il ne fait mention que de quinze peintres tandis qu'il distingue de la manière la plus claire cent soixante et neuf sculpteurs Il faut cependant convenir que Pline fait mention de cent trentetrois peintres Grecs bons ou médiocres On pourroic repondre pour concilier les deux auteurs que Pline a parlé de tous les peintres de la Grèce de l'Asie Mineure de la Sicile et de ce que l'on appelloit la grande Grèce c et que Pausanias n'a pas même visité toute la Grèce proprement dite qu'il n'écrivoit point l'histoire des artistes et qu'il parloit seulement de ceux dont il avoit vû les ouvrages ouvrages dont le nombre étoit encore diminué par l'avidité des Romains qui dévastoient ce pays depuis environs quatrevingt ans à compter le tems qui s'étoit écoulé depuis Pline jusqu'à lui  Il resultera toujours de ce calcul qu'il y avoit plus de statues que de tableaux dans la Grèce  Antiquités  tom ii p  Of all the arts in which they excelled sculpture seems indeed to have been the prime favourite of the Greeks and to the national enthusiasm  in its favour the Grecian statues are principally indebted for their exquisite perfection  Ver  Records her sorrow and preserves her fame  Scopas a native of Paros is mentioned by Pliny as a contemporary with Myron and Polycletus in the th Olympiad He is represented also by the same author and by Vitruvius as one of the eminent artists employed by the magnificent Artemisia in decorating the monument of her husband Mausolus  But as a sculptor who lived so early could hardly have been living at the time when that sumptuous monument was raised Winkelman conjectures that more than one artist was distinguished by the name of Scopas It seems rather more probable that Pliny was mistaken in the period he assigned to this admirable sculptor and indeed the chronology of almost all the ancient artists and their most memorable works is so full of perplexities and contradiction that mistakes of this kind are almost unavoidable in a cursory view of their productions  The works of Scopas seem to have been full of fancy and feeling yet it is not easy to form an exact idea of his three statues representing the variations of Love as they are briefly described by Pausanias  The commentator on Pausanias to elucidate these three Greek titles of Cupid refers his reader to the Grecian Phurnutus "De Natura Deorum" but on consulting Phurnutus I find no light but rather the "darkness visible" of ridiculous etymologies    Pliny has enumerated many works of Scopas that held in the period when he wrote a very high rank among the sculptural decorations  of Rome The Palatine Apollo a sitting Vesta with two female attendants and a collection of marine divinities which according to the lively expression of the enthusiastic Pliny might be termed a glorious performance if it had employed the whole life of the artist  Sed in maxima dignatione Cn Domitii delubro in Circo Flaminio Neptunus ipse et Thetis atque Achilles Nereides supra Delphinos et Cete et Hippocampos fedentes Item Tritones chorusque Phorci et Pristes ac multa alia marina omnia ejusdem manus praeclarum opus etiamsi totius vitae fuisset  PLIN lib xxxvi c    M de Caylus imagines that these Nereids riding on their seahorses were executed in basrelief Falconet is of a different opinion It is however probable that they were so and that they are still preserved  I have seen admirable sketches of such Nereids as answer to Pliny's description executed at Rome by Mr Howard an English artist who has the rare talent of drawing from sculpture with such precision and delicacy that England may soon surpass other countries in a just and graceful representation of those ancient statues which her men of fortune and taste have collected especially as the Dilettanti Society have judiciously confided to this artist the conduct of such a work peculiarly calculated to display his abilities and to reflect an honour on their own institution It is much to be lamented that almost all the prints designed to illustrate the many voluminous and costly books upon sculpture are rather caricatures of ancient art than a faithful copy of its perfections  But to return to the ancient artist whose works are the immediate subject of this notePliny has very highly praised a Venus by Scopas and is supposed to have said that it excelled the Gnidian Venus of Praxiteles which he had just celebrated as the most beautiful statue to be found on earth Falconet with his usual petulance derides Pliny for so gross a contradiction and even his liberal friend and admirer M de Caylus laments this striking inconsistency Let me hazard  what appears to me a probable conjecture to save the credit of an author to whom the lovers of art have infinite obligation I am persuaded that all the blame which Pliny has incurred for this supposed contradiction arose solely from a slip of the pen in the original manuscript but to elucidate the point I must transcribe the passage as it stands and add the new reading I wish to introduce  Praeterea Venus in eodem loco nuda Praxitelicam illam Gnidiam antecedens et quemcunque alium locum nobilitatura  According to the present reading there is not only a contradiction of what he had just asserted concerning the preeminence of the Gnidian statue but the latter part of the sentence has little or no meaning By the following slight change in the orthography the absurd contradiction will be utterly removed and a significant spirit will appear in the close of the sentence  Praeterea Venus in eodem loco nuda Praxitelicam illam Gnidi  non  antecedens  at  quemcunque alium locum nobilitatura    A naked Venus not surpassing indeed that of Praxiteles at Gnidos but such as would ennoble any other place  Pliny mentions it as a doubt in his age whether the Niobe at Rome is the work of Praxiteles or of Scopas M de Caylus makes a pleasant remark on the modesty of the Roman author and recommends it as a lesson to modern connoisseurs  On doit lui savoir gré de l'aveu de son ignorance sur le nom des auteurs des ouvrages qui decoroient la ville de Rome Il donne en ce cas une leçon à tous les curieux presens et à venir dont la décision est pour l'ordinaire imperieuse et sans appel  Mem de l'Academie  tom xxv p  Among the impassioned works of Scopas his Bacchanal was particularly admired Junius in his account of this artist has inserted two Greek epigrams from the Anthologia in praise of the figure to which I allude but there is a third epigram by Paulus Silentiarius  one of the best among the late writers in that motley collection which was probably composed on the same statue and which I prefer to the two epigrams cited by Junius It runs thus      This Bacchanal grew wild by art alone  Art that infus'd delirium in the stone  There is a very pompous eulogy on the Bacchanal of Scopas in that singular little work Descriptions of Fourteen Ancient Statues in Greek prose by Callistratus It is surprising that two such scholars as Meursius and Olearius could suppose these descriptions to be written by the very Callistratus whom Demosthenes attended with delight as his master in eloquence They rather seem the production of some trifling and declamatory sophist of a much later period The description of the Bacchanal closes however with a high compliment to the genius of Scopas as it asserts that his sculpture displayed that sort of energy and spirit which characterised the orations of Demosthenes Olearius who published Callistratus in his excellent edition of the two Philostrati supposes this comparison of the sculptor with the orator to have been added to the original description by some later hand As it is peculiarly  honourable to Scopas I will transcribe it at the bottom of the page  CALLISTRATI Statuae p    This eminent artist like his predecessor Phidias and many of the Greeks was doubly distinguished as an architect and a sculptor Perhaps he was employed in both capacities on the magnificent tomb of Mausolus a work celebrated by many writers of antiquity as one of the seven wonders of the world and ingeniously illustrated by M de Caylus in a dissertation on its form and dimensions which the curious reader may find in the Memoirs of the French Academy Five artists of distinction were engaged in this stupendous structure which rose to the height of an hundred and forty feet including what crowned the summita triumphal chariot of marble The columns that surrounded the lower part of the fabric amounted to thirtysix comprising its four fronts Those to the south and north were more extensive than the other two The eastern aspect was assigned to the conduct of Scopas The monument is doubly remarkable as a work of magnificent expense and of genuine affection The fair sovereign of Caria was so sincere a mourner that she is said to have died literally of grief for the lost Mausolus before his sumptuous monument could be completed She had however sufficient energy of character to act as a heroine after his decease and Vitruvius records an anecdote of her prowess which I am induced to mention as it shews in a very forcible light the veneration paid by the ancients to the statues erected under the auspices of Victory  The Rhodians who were subject to Mausolus rebelled against his widow Artemisia The indignant queen by a very bold stratagem took possession of their city and raised in it as a trophy of her conquest  two statues of brass her own figure and another representing Rhodes submitting to her authority "The Rhodians" says Vitruvius  were prevented by their religion from removing those statues but they built around them to conceal from the view of the public memorials of their disgrace  Tunc Arthemisia Rhodo capta principibus occisis trophaeum in urbe Rhodo suae victoriae constituit Aeneasque duas statuas fecit unam Rhodiorum civitatis alteram suae imaginis et istam figuravit Rhodiorum civitati stigmata imponentem Postea autem Rhodii  religione impediti  quod nefas est trophaea dedicata removeri circa eum locum aedificium struxerunt et id erecta Graja statione texerunt ne quis posset aspicere et id  vocitari jusserunt  VITRUVIUS lib ii edit Galiani p    Demosthenes in his fine oration in favour of the Rhodians intimates that Artemisia would not oppose such efforts as Athens might honourably make to restore the liberty of Rhodes  There is a medal of this affectionate heroine with the Mausoleum but it is a counterfeit as I learn from the instructive and entertaining Essay on Medals by Mr Pinkerton a writer equally admirable for depth of research and vivacity of description  NOTE VI Ver  And Cupid soon her own repays the fond device  Praxiteles who is mentioned by Pliny as flourishing with his brother artist Euphranor in the th Olympiad arose to the highest distinction for the impassioned delicacy of his works both in brass and marble but particularly in marble The rank he held in the public esteem is evident from the petty anecdote recorded in Phaedrus that those who had delicate pieces of sculpture to sell enhanced the price of them by erasing  the name of Myron and inserting that of Praxiteles in its place  Ut quidam artifices nostro faciunt saeculo  Qui Pretium operibus majus inveniunt novo  Si marmori adscripserint Praxitelem suo  Detrito Myrone argento  PHAEDRUS  Pliny who has enumerated many productions of Praxiteles celebrates his Gnidian Venus as the most perfect image of beauty that sculpture ever produced and relates some amusing incidents in proof of its perfection particularly an offer made to the inhabitants of Gnidos by the king Nicomedes who was desirous of purchasing this admired statue on the liberal terms of paying the heavy public debt of their island They chose rather to struggle with any difficulties than to relinquish a work of art with which Praxiteles had ennobled their country The statue was stationed in a small open temple that the form of the goddess might be visible in every direction and it was esteemed admirable in every point of view  Praxitelis aetatem inter statuarios diximus qui marmoris gloria superavit etiam semet Opera ejus sunt Athenis in Ceramico sed ante omnia et non solum Praxitelis verum et in toto orbe terrarum Venus quam ut viderent multi navigaverunt Gnidum Duas fecerat simulque vendebat alteram velata specie

ejus tota aperitur ut conspici possit undique effigies deae favente ipsa ut creditur facto nec minor ex quacunque parte admiratio est  PLIN lib xxxvi c  Universal admiration gave birth to several Greek epigrams on this exquisite statue I have selected the two following from the Anthologia          Grotii Versio  Quis lapidi spirare dedit Quis Cyprida vidit  In terris Quantum marmor amoris habet  Praxitelis manus est Venere ut puto regia coeli  Jam caret ad Gnidios venit ut ipsa Venus  Who gave the stone a soul Say who has seen  And of this marble made Affection's queen  Praxiteles thy work makes Heaven appear  Now desolate and Venus only here        Grotii Versio  Alma Venus tibi sacro tuam sub imagine formam  Pulchrius hac potuit nil tibi diva dari  Venus to thee I rais'd thy form divine  Convinc'd no offering can thy form outshine  The glory that Praxiteles acquired from the excellence of his Venus was increased by the felicity with which he executed more than one statue of Cupid The orations of Cicero against Verres have given celebrity to the marble Cupid which the orator represents as a rival to one still more famous by the same artist that formed the pride and the wealth of the Thespiansa statue spared by Mummius when he plundered the cities of Greece The rapacious Verres had robbed an ingenious and friendly Sicilian of a similar exquisite and invaluable work of art which Cicero describes as the production of Praxiteles It is remarkable that the Roman orator speaks with singular modesty on this occasion of his own knowledge as a connoisseur  Marmoreum Praxitelis nimirum didici etiam dum in istum inquiro artificum nomina  The rapacity of the infamous governor had indeed amassed such a collection of sculpture that an examination of his plunder was almost sufficient to form a Roman connoisseur The curious reader may find this collection agreeably illustrated in a Dissertation by the Abbé Fraguier inserted in the Memoires of the French Academy and intitled "The Gallery of Verres"  The happiest of Cicero's repartees alluded to a statue of this collection a very valuable sphinx of bronze which formed a part of the powerful  extortioner's Sicilian plunder Verres had bestowed it as a retaining fee on his advocate the celebrated orator Hortensius who had a strong passion for works of art In the course of the pleadings Hortensius happened to say to his antagonist  I do not understand these riddles  "But you ought" replied Cicero  for you have the sphinx at home  Both Pliny and Quintilian have recorded this bon mot The latter cites it as a model of oratorical urbanity  Ex historia etiam ducere urbanitatem eruditum ut Cicero fecit cum ei testem in judicio verris roganti dixisset Hortensius 'Non intelligo haec aenigmata' 'Atqui debes inquit cum sphingem domi habeas' Acceperat autem ille a Verre sphingem aeneam magnae pecuniae  QUINTIL lib vi c    To return to the Cupid of PraxitelesThe sculptor Falconet has censured his countryman M de Jaucourt for inserting in the French Encyclopedia an anecdote relating to this celebrated statue told on the authority of the president de Thou The story says that the Marchioness of Mantua possessed in the year the Cupid of Praxiteles and the sleeping Cupid of Michael Angelo and that de Thou with other guests of the Marchioness were charmed with the work of the modern artist till they compared it with a superior work of antiquity that seemed to annihilate its merit The story is certainly improbable in many points of view and Falconet exults in producing what he considers as a proof that the fact was impossible I mean the testimony of Pausanias declaring that the famous Cupid of Praxiteles a statue of marble and the idol of the Thespians perished after a variety of adventures in a fire at Rome The evidence of Pausanias sufficiently proves indeed the fate of the Thespian statue but it does not amount to a proof that it was impossible for the Marchioness of Mantua to possess a Cupid executed by Praxiteles because we have already seen that there existed two marble Cupids of acknowledged beauty by this illustrious sculptor and among the statues described by Callistratus two Cupids by the same artist in bronze are celebrated as works of exquisite  perfection On one of these perhaps the following epigram was written though Junius imagined that it was composed on the Thespian Cupid and that the poet had taken the liberty to turn the marble into brass          Grotii Versio  Praxiteles famulante manu me fecit Amorem  Sub pedibus pressus colla superba meis  Fecit ut in venis quem sensit aheneus essem  Ut Phrynae donum me daret ipse suae  Illa datum tibi rursus Amor sacravit Amori  Namque dari dignum munus amantis Amor  Julian the Aegyptian Prefect on the Cupid of

captive mine To hearts that burn  Love is for Love the only just return  That curious collector of amorous anecdotes Athenaeus relates that Praxiteles gave Phryne the choice of his two admired statues Cupid and a Satyr The lively device by which she is said to have obtained the Cupid I have described with a little variation from Pausanias    PAUSANIAS p  This highlyadmired sculptor had the happiness of training his son Cephissodorus to considerable excellence in his own profession That pleasing and accurate writer the Abbé Guasco has fallen I think into a little mistake concerning this son of Praxiteles whom he represents as pursuing the art of his father without inheriting his talents The words of Pliny who mentions several statues executed by this eminent son of a father still more eminent may rather lead us to think that the genius as well as the property of his parent descended to the filial artist  Praxitelis filius Cephissodorus rei et artis haeres suit Cujus laudatum est Pergami symplegma signum nobile digitis corpori verius quam marmori impressis Romae ejus opera sunt Latona in Palatii delubro Venus in Asnii Pollionis monumentis et intra Octaviae Porticus in

the Grecian sculptor was introduced among the various decorations of that solemn spectacle and distinguished by his favourite statue of the Satyr "Era un quadro" says Vasari in describing these decorations  alto braccia sei e lungo otto nel quale con nuova e quasi poetica invenzione era Michel Agnolo in mezzo come giunto ne campi Elisi dove gli erano da man destra assai maggiori che il

equally distinguished by genius and application as he excelled in the two arts of statuary and painting and wrote upon symmetry and colours One of his memorable pictures was the Battle  of Mantinea In the list of his statues Pliny mentions a Paris of admirable expression two colossal images of Virtue and of Greece and triumphal figures of Alexander and Philip  Euphranoris Alexander Paris est in quo

happy few whom an extraordinary combination of genius industry and good fortune has exalted from an humble unpromising origin to the summit of excellence and honour He was a native of Sicyon and at first a common artizan but having talents for design and being instructed probably by the eminent painter Eupompus  Lysippum Sicyonium Duris negat Tullius fuisse discipulum affirmat sed primo aerarium fabrum audendi rationem cepisse pictoris Eupompi responso eum enim interrogatum quem sequeretur antecedentium dixisse demonstrata hominum multitudine naturam ipsam imitandam esse non artificem  PLIN lib xxxiv c  he rose to the highest distinction as a sculptor Propertius has simply and happily expressed his peculiar merit and his great celebrity in a single verse  Gloria Lysippo est animosa effingere signa  His works were particularly admired for truth and energy of character and the period in which he flourished the th Olympiad afforded him a most favourable field for the utmost exertion of his talents The number of his works is a noble proof of his indefatigable  application They amounted to six hundred and ten according to the most moderate of the two accounts that different copies of Pliny exhibit Even this number has rather a marvellous sound but the following intelligent remarks of M de Caylus on this subject are sufficient to satisfy readers not familiar with the process of this admirable art that the multitude of bronzes ascribed to Lysippus is far from exceeding the limits of credibility though Pliny has mentioned them in such terms as might produce without the explanation of experience only incredulous astonishment  Le nombre des ouvrages des fondeurs en particulier selon Pline est inconcevable On assure que le seul Lysippe en fit six cens dix morceaux qui tous auroient rendu célèbre celui qui n'en auroit fait qu'unseul Il fût aisé de savoir leur nombre car il avoit coûtume de mettre à part un denier d'or quand il en avoit produit un nouveau et son heritier en fit le calcul après sa mort  Pline ne pouvoit rien dire de plus fort que d'ajoûter sur le detail de ces morceaux 'Tantae omnia artis ut claritatem possent dare vel singula'  C'est presenter ce me semble avec trop d'apparat la chose la plus simple et dont le détail méritoit le moins d'être rélevé heureusement la seule pratique de l'art peut nous en donner l'intelligence et même sans faire tort au mérite de Lysippe en faveur de qui tout le monde est prévenu par les eloges de l'antiquité et par l'approbation et le choix d'Alexandre le Grand dont il étoit contemporain Cependant l'explication de ce passage me paroit nécessaire pour concilier toutes les idées d'autant que ceux qui voudroient s'en tenir au texte simple croiroient ne devoir en rien rabattre puisque les preuves de fait sont jointes à une description qui tient non seulement du merveilleux mais qui répond aux grandes idées que l'on a des anciens personne ne les admet plus que moi mais elles demandent  des distinctions D'un autre côté les artistes et les amateurs des arts commenceroient par réjeter fort loin le fait et ils le regarderoient comme impossible car il faut convenir que Pline paroit au premier abord s'être mis ici dans le danger de ceux qui veulent trop prouver  S'il étoit question dans ce calcul des ouvrages de Lysippe des statues de marbre et même de figures de bronze de grandeur naturelle ou faites chacune sur différens modèles quoiqu'il en ait produit plusieurs de ce genre le nombre de six cens dix morceaux de la main d'un seul artiste ne seroit ni possible ni vraisemblable la connoissance des arts et leur marche dans l'exécution vont heureusement servir à lever tous nos doutes  Quand la pratique de la fonte est familière à un artist et qu'il a sous ses ordres des gens capables de l'aider les ouvrages se multiplient en peu de tems l'artiste n'a proprement besoin que de faire des modèles en terre ou en cire manoeuvre que l'on sait être aussi prompte que facile Le moule la fonte et le soin de réparer sont des operations qui ne demandent point la main du maître et cependant la figure n'est pas moins regardée comme son ouvrage Ajoûtons à ces facilités que l'on peut jeter un trèsgrande nombre de figures dans le même moule et sans doute que toutes les fois qu'il en sortoit une de son fourneau Lysippe s'étoit imposé la loi de mettre à part un denier d'or dont le nombre accumulé servit après sa mort à supputer la quantité de figures fondues dans son attelier Il n'eût pas été difficile à Jean de Boulogne d'en faire autant de nos jours et peutêtre que si l'on comptoit le nombre de petites figures qu'il a produites de cette façon on n'en trouveroit guère moins de six cens dix indépendamment des grandes figures équestres et des autres statues ou basréliefs dont il a fait les modèles et à la fonte desquels il a présidé  M de CAYLUS  Memoires de l' Academie  c tom xxv p  This illustrious connoisseur proceeds to shew the delight which the ancients took in small statues of bronze I shall soon introduce to my reader a Roman poet's description of the most memorable image of this kind executed by Lysippus but I will first notice a few of his most remarkable productions on a larger scale  The city of Tarentum was decorated with two colossal divinities by Lysippusa Jupiter and a Hercules When Fabius Maximus made himself master of the place he said according to Plutarch "Let us leave to the Tarentines their angry gods" and he left them their lofty Jupiter influenced most probably more by the difficulty of removing a statue whose height exceeded forty cubits  Lysippi Jupiter ista  Transivit quadraginta cubita altus Tarento  LUCILLIUS Sat lib xvi apud Ronium  Strabo speaks of this Jupiter as the second of colossal figures in magnitude inferior only to the Colossus of Rhodes  than by his devotional ideas for he carried off the Hercules a Colossus of inferior bulk to place it in the Capitol and Plutarch censures this wary Roman for being more rapacious in Tarentum than Marcellus was in Syracuse  Rome possessed another work of Lysippus particularly memorable as it discovers the lively interest which the Roman people took in these Grecian ornaments of their city The statue I allude to represented a man rubbing himself after the use of the bath It had been stationed with the usual solemnities before the baths of Agrippa but as it happened to delight the fancy of Tiberius that subtle and cautious emperor was rash enough to remove it to his own chamber The people demanded by loud clamours in the theatre that the statue should be restored to its proper place and the sovereign submitted to its restoration  Plin lib xxxiv c  The history of statues is particularly interesting as it illustrates  the manners and the feelings of the ancient world What a portrait does this anecdote exhibit of the Roman people who could clamorously solicit and obtain the restoration of a public statue a simple foreign figure when they had not courage or virtue enough left to vindicate their liberty against this timid licentious and despicable tyrant  But to return to Lysippus The work which was probably his own favourite performance I mean his equestrian statues of Alexander and the guardian attendants of that idolized monarch were transported to Rome after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and adorned the Portico of Metellus  Hic est Metellus Macedonicus qui porticus quae fuere circumdatae duabus aedibus sine inscriptione positis quae nunc Octaviae porticibus ambiuntur fecerat quique hanc turmam statuarum equestrium quae frontem aedium spectant hodieque maximum ornamentum ejus loci ex Macedonia detulit Cujus turmae hanc causam referunt Magnum Alexandrum impetrasse a Lysippo singulari talium auctore operum ut eorum equitum qui ex ipsius turma apud Granicum stumen ceciderant expressa similitudine figurarum faceret statuas et ipsius quoque iis interponeret  VELLEIUS PATERCULUS lib i    The Anthologia contains more than one epigram on the portrait of Alexander by Lysippus The following appears to be the best          Grotii Versio  Aequat Alexandri vultumque animumque ferocem  Lysippus tantum posse quis aera putet  Aereus iste Jovem spectans clamare videtur  Subdo mihi terras tu pater astra tene  Archelaus or according to others Aesclepiades on the Statue of Alexander  All Alexander's powers of form and mind  Thy skill Lysippus in this brass enshrin'd  The bronze exclaims with Heavendirected eyes  "Earth is my empire Jove Rule thou the skies"  Plutarch in one of his Moral Treatises has cited with some applause the two last lines of this epigram and a very elegant accomplished writer of our own country Mr Webb has inserted a translation of them in his th Dialogue on the Beauties of Painting but I think he has made the supposed speech of the hero rather more disrespectful to Jupiter than the Greek poet intended I will give my reader an immediate opportunity of correcting me if I am wrong in this supposition by transcribing the couplet to which I allude  Let us divide O Jove the conqueror cries  I lord of earth thou tyrant of the skies  WEBB p edit  We are indebted to Plutarch for the interesting anecdote concerning the just reproof of Lysippus to his brother artist Apelles  PLUTARCHUS de Iside et Osiride p edit Cantab  The character of this great statuary appears to have been so noble that his life was probably as worthy of being recorded for its virtues as his productions were for their fidelity to truth and nature yet to our regret we can know but very little of his personal history and of his numerous invaluable works The two eminent antiquarians Winkelman and Caylus have supposed that not a single fragment remains D'Hancarville is inclined to believe that a bust of Bacchus preserved at Portici is a real work of this exquisite artist and his reasons for thinking so may serve to illustrate the peculiar excellencies of Lysippus  Le beau buste Bacchus en bronze conservé à Portici étant un chefd'oeuvre de l'art il fût nécessairement exécuté avant la perte des anciennes méthodes et comme la tête de ce buste comparée au col seroit petite par rapport au reste du corps comme le cheveux en sont admirablement bien travaillés et comme on y remarque d'ailleurs la plus grande élégance dans les moindres parties cela m'a faite dire cidessus que je croyois reconnoitre la main de Lysippe dans ce rare morceau car ce sont les caractères que Pline donne expressément à ses ouvrages lib xxxiv 'Statuariae arti plurimum traditur contulisse capillum exprimendo capita minora faciendo quam antiqui Propriae hujus videntur esse argutiae operum custoditae in minimis quoque rebus  In speaking of Lysippus I musst not fail to observe that his brother Lysistratus was also an eminent statuary and particularly distinguished as the first who executed portraits with the utmost exactness by the ingenious device of taking a cast in plaister from the face  In citing the words of Pliny which celebrate Lysistratus for this invention I will venture to suggest a new reading in the passage which may vindicate as I imagine this interesting author from the charge of having expressed himself rather absurdly on this subject  Hominis autem imaginem gypso e facie ipsâ primus omnium expressit cerâque in eam formam gypsi infusâ emendare instituit Lysistratus Sicyonius frater Lysippi de quo diximus Sic et similitudinem reddere instituit ante eum quam pulcherrimas facere studebant Idem et de signis effigiem exprimere invenit Crevitque res in tantum utnulla signa  statuaeve sine argilla  fierent  Quo apparet antiquiorem hanc fuisse scientiam quam fundendi aeris Lib xxxv c So stood the passage till the Paris editor of Pliny in twelve quartos made the following alteration "ut nulla signa suâ sine argillâ fierent" By changing the superfluous word  statuaeve  into  suâ  he hoped to rectify the weakness of the passage but I apprehend another very slight alteration may improve it much more Instead of  sine agilla  I would read  sine arte illâ  considering those words as expressing the invention of Lysistratus and giving a little better sense to the close of the passage  antiquiorem hanc fuisse scientiam quam fundendi aeris  which may then signify that this practice of casting the real features in plaister was prior to the formation of perfect portraits in bronze    I have seen it somewhere observed that a statue resembling the diminutive Hercules of Lysippus was formerly in the possession of the celebrated Pithou who has been called the Varro of France but I apprehend that interesting work of ancient art has long ceased to exist and as the animated poem in which Statius has described the statue and its most amiable possessor has not

author of the work  Lysippus wish a more accomplish'd judge  NOTE IX Ver  And Grief's convulsion shakes the sphere of Art  M de Caylus closes one of his Discourses on the Sculpture of the Ancients in the Memoirs of the French Academy with a circumstantial account of the Rhodian Colossus collected from the authors of remote and recent times who have occasionally mentioned this most magnificent of all colossal figures the memorable production of a little island once ennobled by the united influence of liberty art and naval power Yet after the researches of an accomplished writer on a subject so attractive to his fancy we must still remain in ignorance of some particulars relating to this interesting image that a lover of the arts would be glad to ascertain Much however is known Pliny has described the fragments of this Colossus in clear and animated language  Ante onines autem in admiratione suit Solis Colossus Rhodi quem fecerat Chares Lindins Lysippi supra dicti discipulus Septuaginta cubitorum altitudinis fuit Hoc simulacrum post quinquagesimum sextum annum terrae motu prostratum sed jacens quoque miraculo est Pauci pollicem ejus amplectuntur Majores sunt digiti quam pleraeque statuae Vasti specus hiant defractis membris spectantur intus magnae molis saxa quorum pondere stabiliverat constituens Duodecim annis tradunt effectum CCC talentis quae contulerant ex apparatu regis Demetrii relicto morae taedio Sunt alii minores hoc in eadem urbe colossi centum numero sed ubicunque singuli fuissent nobilitaturi locum  PLIN lib xxxiv  The Greek epigram containing its dimensions varies according to different readings from seventy to eighty cubits M de Caylus forming his calculation from the expression of Pliny that few men could embrace the thumb concludes that the height of the perfect statue was about an hundred and five feet  We learn from Strabo that it was broken asunder at the knees and that the Rhodians considered themselves as prohibited by an oracle from replacing it They probably guarded the fragments with a religious veneration I know not otherwise how to account for a very surprising fact which my deceased friend Gibbon has recorded with his usual elegance and energy of expression He observes that  after standing fiftysix years the Colossus of Rhodes was overthrown by an earthquake but the massy trunk and huge fragments lay scattered eight centuries on the ground  I cannot transcribe the words of an accomplished author whose memory is so justly dear to me without reflecting with poignant regret what infinite advantages for the improvement of my present work I might have derived from his taste knowledge and kindness had his life been extended according to my wishes Gibbon though he was not a collector of statues or pictures had a lively esteem for all the fine arts  I return to the Rhodian ApolloIf we may trust the Byzantine writers Theophanes and Constantine the brass of this Colossus was gilt  CONSTANT de Adminis Imp edit p  The Saracen chief who invaded Rhodes in the year seized and transported this ponderous plunder into Syria where it was publicly sold to a Jew of Edessa The story of loading nine hundred camels with the weight of these stupendous relies has the air of an Arabian tale M de Caylus imagines that modern writers have fallen into a great mistake concerning the attitude and the station of the standing Colossus by representing it as a striding figure at the entrance of the port as the reader may have seen it in ordinary prints with vessels failing between its legs This intelligent writer rather supposes it to have been placed on the shore upon a single triangular basis of white marble He says that no ancient author no ancient monument is  found to countenance the modern supposition of a striding attitude yet I apprehend the following epigram in the Anthologia according to one mode of construction amounts almost to a proof that the statue had a double basis part on the land and part in the water                On the Statue raised to the Sun by the Rhodians  To thee O Sun thy Rhodians bade arise  This bright Colossus tow'ring to the skies  Of brass for they invasion's tide repress'd  Thus crown'd their isle with spoils true valor's test  O'er land and water it was theirs to raise  Unconquer'd liberty's enlivening blaze  For they who drew from Hercules their birth  Were heirs of empire o'er the sea and earth  But circumstances relating to this celebrated work are so far from being clearly known that the statue has been ascribed to different  artists to Chares to Laches and to Lysippus himself Meursius supposes with great probability that it was begun by Chares and finished by Laches These two sculptors were both natives of Lindus a Rhodian city and Chares is known to have been a favourite disciple of Lysippus A passage of Cicero in which he is mentioned as such informs us in what particular parts of the human figure different sculptors of eminence were thought to excel  Chares a Lysippo statuas facere non isto modo didicit ut Lysippus caput ostenderet Myronis brachia Praxitelis pectus Polycleti sed omnia coram magistrum facientem videbat caeterorum opera vel suasponte considerare poterat  Rhet ad Herennium lib iv    NOTE X Ver  Servility benumbs the soul of Greece  Winkelmann who justly estimated the influence of freedom upon art has observed that after Greece was reduced to the condition of a Roman province history mentions no Greek artist of any note till the period of the Roman triumvirate "The liberty of the Greeks" says that animated author  was buried in the ruins of Corinth Art sunk entirely in Magna Graecia where it had flourished with the philosophy of Pythagoras and of Zeno in the bosom of many free and opulent cities It perished utterly by the arms and the barbarity of the Romans  NOTE XI Ver  And faintly promising to flourish died  The learned and enthusiastic historian of ancient art in noticing its migration from the desolated cities of Greece into Syria and Aegypt remarks that being employed to serve the pomp and pageantry of courts it lost an infinite portion of its grandeur and genius under the Seleucides and the Ptolemies Yet he asserts that under Ptolemy Philadelphus "Alexandria became almost what Athens had been"  Is not this paying rather too high a compliment to the Egyptian monarch He was however a patron of art and a lover of magnificence His regard for a Grecian city distinguished by talents appears conspicuous from a circumstance recorded by Athenaeus in the description of a splendid festival with which Ptolemy amused himself and the people of Alexandria In this gorgeous scene an immense multitude of statues were carried in procession and near to that of Ptolemy himself who was attended by three oddlygrouped companions Alexander Virtue and Priapus was the image of Corinth adorned with a diadem of gold    ATHENAEUS p    Winkelmann imagines from the profusion of statues which appeared in this sumptuous pageant that a great number of Grecian statuaries found at this peirod an asylum in Alexandria If they did it is but too probable that their talents were enfeebled by their change of situation since Winkelmann himself has observed that of the artists who  then flourished in Egypt we know only the name of a single sculptor Satyreius who formed of chrystal a portrait of Arsinoe the wife of Ptolemy Philadelphus a performance celebrated in the following Greek epigram from the Fourth Book of the Anthologia      Grotii Versio  Zeuxidos et color et gratia sed Satureius  Tam varias laudes exhibet Arsinoes  In glacie parva Dominae sum tantula tantae  Effigies in me nil tamen ejus abest  Diodorus on the sculptured Chrystal  Thine Zeuxis grace and colour yet in me  Small chrystal image for Arsinoe  By Satureius form'd her charms are seen  True as they sparkle in the living queen  Winkelmann considers this representation of Arsinoe as an engraved gem but I have seen a small bust of chrystal and porphyry united which may possibly be the very portrait described by Diodorus  Ptolemy was so fond of the arts and of his queen that he is said to have projected a temple to her memory so vaulted with loadstone as to keep a metallic statue of Arsinoe suspended in the air a project which the death of his famous architect Dimocrates is supposed to have defeated Arsinoe happened to suffer in a singular manner in consequence of her husband's passion for sculpture In marrying his daughter to Antiochus king of Syria Ptolemy had affectionately conducted the bride to Seleucia and being charmed by a magnificent statue of Diana he received it as a present from his soninlaw and transported it to Alexandria but Arsinoe falling sick on its arrival saw in her troubled dreams the offended goddess who complained of being removed from her Syrian temple Ptolemy had tenderness sufficient to calm the disturbed fancy of his queen by sending back the favourite statue but had not the reward he deserved for his humanitythe delight of restoring the health of his Arsinoe  Winkelmann in speaking of the arts at the court of Seleucia asserts that the Grecian sculptors who migrated into Asia surpassed in their works such of their brethren as remained in their own country and he quotes the last character of Theophrastus in proof of this assertion In consulting the character referred to I find nothing that can relate to works of art but in a character very near the last the d on Ostentation I find a passage which if it proves any thing may be thought rather to prove the reverse of what the learned historian of art has in this instance advanced with an inaccuracy very pardonable in an animated writer whose researches were so extensive and whose general merits are so great Theophrastus makes his man of ostentation who boasts of his campaigns with Alexander contend that the artists in  Asia are superior to those in Europe whence we may reasonably infer not that they really were so but that Theophrastus rather thought the contrary The passage however alludes not to statues but to goblets and gems    THEOPHRASTUS edit Newton p    The learned Heyne in his Dissertation on the Ptolemies has justly observed  Primorum statim regum studia artium et cupiditates operum ad fastum et magnificentiam potius se inclinasse quam ad judicii elegantiam aut verae pulchritudinis sensum ex ipsis enim regni opibus mature luxus et mollities orta aulam et urbem tanquam pestilenti sidere afflavit  HEYNE Opuscula vol i p  NOTE XII Ver  Thy zeal to save may Sculpture's field express  Whether we contemplate the excellence or the number of ancient statues that have been wonderfully recovered in the three last centuries our obligations to Time as a preserver are such as may justly excite astonishment and gratitude Had he restored only the Laocoon the Apollo of the Belvedere and the Medicaean Venus a lover of the arts might consider his kindness in the department of sculpture as equivalent to his literary beneficence in preserving the compositions of Demosthenes Plato and Homer The liberality of Time as a restorer will appear in the strongest point of view if we contrast what Poggio said of the statues in Rome in the fifteenth century and what the Abbé Guasco  wrote to his brother on the same subject about fifty years ago I will transcribe the two passages I allude to observing that the testimony of Poggio is the more to be depended on as he was particularly fond of ancient sculpture His delight in collecting fragments of antiquity is recorded by the accomplished historian of Lorenzo de MediciRoscoe vol ii p  Me maxime movet quod his subjiciam ex innumeris ferme Colossis statuisque tum marmoreis tum aeneis nam argenteas atque aureas minime miror fuisse conflatas viris illustribus ob virtutem positis ut omittam varia signa voluptatis atque artis causa publice ad spectaculum collocata marmoreas quinque tantum quatuor in

quae est ad Basilicam Leteranensem Septimio Severo dicatam tantum videmus superesse ut partem maximam stragis urbis si quis numerum advertat hoc solum fuisse fateatur  Thus feelingly did Poggio describe the sculptural poverty of Rome possessing only five ancient statues in the year according to Gibbon's remarks on the date of his "elegant moral lecture"  De Varietate Fortunae  In the year the Abbé Guasco writing from Rome to his brother gives the following account of the sculpture that had delighted him in that city  Ses anciennes productions sont innombrables et elles passent toute expression autant en beauté qu'en quantité Le nombre des statues antiques est si grand que si l'on faisoit comme dans l'ancienne Rome le cens des citoyens je doute si ceuxci ne se trouveroient pas inferieurs en nombre à celui de ce peuple inanimé  De l'Usage des Statues chez les Anciens  Preface p  NOTE XIII Ver  This richest offspring of confederate skill  It is a supposition of Winkelmann that the Rhodian sculptor Agesander executed himself the figure of Laocoon and Agesander's two sons Athenodorus and Polydorus the two younger figures of the group an idea so pleasing that the fancy and the heart are both willing to embrace it  Felix de Fredis a Roman citizen had the good fortune to discover the Laocoon and to receive from pope Julius the Second an ecclesiastical pension for his discovery Leo the Tenth exonerated the revenues of the church from this pension and gave to Fredis in exchange the post of apostolical secretary in the year The raising of this glorious work of art from its grave might form perhaps a very interesting historical picture as some eminent personages might be introduced as spectators of the scene The following Latin verses were written on the statue soon after its revival by the celebrated Cardinal Sadolet  JACOBI SADOLETI De Laocoontis Statua  Ecce alto terrae cumulo ingentisque ruinae  Visceribus iterum reducem longinqua reduxit  Laocoonta dies

of ruin'd pride  I have already observed that it was a doubt in the age of Pliny whether the Niobe should be ascribed to Praxiteles or to Scopas Winkelmann and the Abbé Guasco agree in assigning it to the latter  If their conjecture be just it is yet probable that Praxiteles also executed a statue of Niobe from the following epigram in the Anthologia      Grotii Versio  Ex viva lapidem dii me fecere sed ecce  Praxiteles vivam me facit ex lapide  Gods made me stone for a presumptuous strife  Praxiteles in stone restores my life  NOTE XV Ver  His brief existence ebbing as he lies  The statue commonly called the Dying Gladiator has been supposed to be the work of Ctesilaus described by Pliny  vulneratum desicientem in quo possit intelligi quantum restat animae  Lib xxxiv    But Winkelmann imagines it to be rather the figure of a herald and allows his reader the choice of three eminent heralds of antiquity who were slain in despight of their pacific officePolyphontes the herald of Laius killed by oedipus Copreas the herald of Eurystheus destroyed by the Athenians and Anthemocritus the herald of Athens murdered by the inhabitants of Megara  NOTE XVI Ver  And feels the god reanimate his frame  In contemplating the Farnesian Hercules I believe many spectators feel an involuntary mechanical impulse to muscular exertion The daily contemplation of very fine sculpture that expressed with the utmost powers of art great elevation of mind would probably have a strong and happy influence on mental character  The legs of this celebrated Hercules were wanting when the statue was first discovered The following anecdote concerning them is related by Bottari in one of his notes to Vasari's Life of Michel Angelo  A questa statua fra Guglielmo della Porta rifece le gambe tanto excellentemente che essendosi dissoi nel trovate le antiche Michelagnolo su di parere che vi si lasciassero stare le moderne et le antiche furono riposte in una stanza del palazzo Medesino E Fama ancora che lo stesso Michelagnolo ne facesse prima il modello di terra e sopra esso le scolpisse poi di marmo fra Guglielmo  NOTE XVII Ver  Saw in his touch the grandeur of the whole  The interesting description of Michel Angelo's amusement in the decline of life rests on the authority of Sandrart who published his "Admiranda Sculpturae Veteris" in Bottari in the book that I have cited in the preceding note expresses himself rather angrily against Sandrart for having represented Michel Angelo as blind a circumstance that he considers as false But the laborious painter of Germany who published such extensive wellintended yet very imperfect works upon Art might very innocently call a noble veteran of ninety blind without meaning more than such infirmity of vision as naturally belongs to that age Or perhaps he might too easily credit a popular report That Sandrart was credulous in the extreme the reader will readily allow who happens to recollect the ridiculous things he has related concerning the Apollo of the Belvedere in his  Admiranda Sculpturae  NOTE XVIII Ver  Scorn for the rancour of malignant foes  Of all the productions of art that have escaped destruction the statue of Apollo  says Winkelmann  is unquestionably the most sublime It rises indeed as a single figure to the highest pitch of excellence but I confess the group of the Laocoon appears to me a superior effort of sculpture  NOTE XIX Ver  A fav'rite truth reserv'd for future verse  Some of the most accomplished of recent writers on Painting and Sculpture particularly Winkelmann and Webb seem to consider the influence of revealed religion as unfavourable to each of these interesting professions On the contrary it may I think be proved that Christianity is as much superior to Paganism for the favourable guidance of art as it confessedly is for the moral conduct of life a point that I hope to illustrate more at large if I should happen to have powers and opportunity to execute what I originally thought of blending with the present publicationan extensive Sketch of Modern Sculpture  END OF THE NOTES ON THE THIRD EPISTLE  NOTES ON THE  FOURTH EPISTLE  NOTE I Ver  MIGHT owe the mask dramatic muses wear  Dempster who has laboured with admirable zeal and erudition to revive the honour of Etruria contends very strenuously for the inventive genius of the Etruscans Among the many inventions that he ascribes to them we may reckon not only the mask the buskin and the brazen trumpet but almost all  The pomp and circumstance of glorious war  and particularly the solemnities of triumphal magnificence  This early and zealous advocate for the glory of Etruria is angry with Strabo for having imagined that the Romans had borrowed such solemnities from the Greeks  Videtur Strabo triumphandi apparatum ad Romanos quidem a Tuscis venisse significare sed et illos a Graecis hausisse quod non potest mirum videri in Graeculo impensius  patriae suae encomiis favente Nam verius Appianus Alexandrinus facundus olim Romae advocatus et verax historicus antiquiorem multo facit triumphi apud Etruscos inventionem scilicet mille annis et amplius ante Romam  DEMPSTER  Etruria Regalis  tom i p  NOTE II Ver  Made home the passion of the virtuous breast  Lares apud antiquos nihil profecto erant nisi piorum animae quae corpore functae familiam suam et posteros tuebantur qua de re impensissime per singulas domos colebantur tantaque religione ut ab ipsis Laribus per quoddam translatum ipsae aedes vocatae sint  The learned Passerius thus describes the Lares in his interesting Dissertation "De Laribus Etruscorum" inserted in the first volume of his splendid work "Picturae Etruscorum in Vasculis"  It is Macrobius if I remember right who says that the Aegyptians had their Lares The  of the Greeks are also considered as answering to the Lares of the Latins yet I imagine it may be justly asserted that the Etruscans were peculiarly distinguished by their remarkable attention to these domestic deities The word Lar is Etruscan and originally signified "a hero" in that language The Lararia  in domibus secreta quaedam penetralia in quibus diligentissime dii domestici servabantur Lares et Genii utriusque sexus  the scenes in which these household deities were guarded and worshipped are frequently displayed in the works of Etruscan art so that we may almost say in the words of old Ennius altered a little for this application of them  Hoc filo pendebit Etruria tota  I cannot conclude this note without observing that the domestic deities afford a delightful subject for poetry and that the subject has been treated with great moral elegance and exquisite sensibility in a poem entitled "Hymn to the Penates" by Mr Southey  NOTE III Ver  Foil'd in sharp conflict from the Tyrrhene coast  It appears from a passage in Athenaeus that the Etruscans had a naval engagement with the Argonauts and that of all the Grecian heroes their pilot Glaucus was the only one who escaped without a wound Even he perhaps was drowned in the conflict as the words of this obscure tradition may lead us to conjecture    ATHENAEUS p    NOTE IV Ver  His mild morality's benignant sway  Dempster ever zealous for the glory of Etruria contends on the authority of Suidas that Pythagoras was an Etruscan and not a native of Samos as he is generally called Suidas indeed asserts that when he was a youth he migrated from Etruria to Samos with his father Mnesarchus a sculptor of gems But wherever this illustrious philosopher  was born the moral influence of his doctrine on the cities of Tuscany is universally allowed and Brucker in his elaborate History of Philosophy thus describes the effect of his admonitions on the inhabitants of Crotona  Ita emendabat Crotoniatorum mores et ad frugalitatem revocabat et ad virtutem singulas hominum aetates et sexum mira eloquentiae efficacia excitabat  Hist Crit Philos  tom i p  NOTE V Ver  Her brave Halesus of Argolic race  "En passant en Etrurie" says the Abbé Guasco in speaking of statues raised in honour of public characters  nous trouverions que les anciens fondateurs ou legislateurs de cette nation

villes et que l'inscription en caractère Etrusque qu'on lisoit aux pieds de sa statue disoit fils de Neptune et descendu des Veiens Le cabinet de Cortone conserve une statue de ces héros armé en cuirasse et en casque  I apprehend the learned Abbé has led me to confound two different heroes of the same title This is not the Halesus who makes a much more graceful figure as a warrior in the poetry of Virgil than his namesake does in the ancient sculpture of his Etruscan cotemporaries according to the engraving of his image which I find in the First Volume of Gori's "Museum Etruscum"  Dempster imagines there were two Etruscan kings of this name The first governed the Veientes before the aera of the Salian priests the second is believed to have been a son of Agamemnon immortalized in the following verses of Virgil and of Ovid  Sed bellis acer Halesus  Tendit in adversos seque in sua colligit arma  Aeneid x v  Argiva est pompae facies Agamemnone caeso  Et scelus et patrias fugit

xiii  I ought not to quit Etruria without observing that many laudable efforts have been made to rescue and elucidate the almost annihilated reliques of this unfortunate nation by several authors of indefatigable industry and refined erudition Much may be learned from Dempster Gori and the senator Buonarotti still more from the various Latin dissertations of Passeri and the Saggio di Lingua Etrusca Dall Abate Lauzi The latter has added to his deep researches into the language of Etruria a very pleasing little Treatise  Circa la Scoltura degli Antichi e i varii suoi Stili  On that of Etruria he observes  Direbbesi che il disegno Etrusco nelle figure si conforma con quello della lot loro architettural'ordine Toscanico è il piu forte di tutti ma il meno gentile  NOTE VI Ver  Their works she blindly prais'd and basely stole  Nothing could exceed the inaptitude of the Romans to excell in the art of sculpture except the rapacity with which they seized the statues of the various nations who surpassed them in ingenuity  Their public ravages of this kind were often followed by petty acts of barbarism and baseness still more detestable for not contented with having carried off the monuments of public merit from the countries they overcame they erased inscriptions from the statues of illustrious men and inserted false titles of their own On this occasion it is justice to exclaim with Cicero "Odi falsas inscriptiones statuarum alienarum"  The learned Figrelius who has written at length on the statues of the Romans relates some curious examples of this sculptural forgery It appears from the authority of Dio Chrysostom that Alcibiades was turned into Aenobarbus and according to Zonaras even Constantine the Great did not scruple to put his own name on a statue of Apollo but if he did so we may hope it was rather to annihilate the worship he condemned than to impose the figure of a Pagan divinity on the people as the real representative of a Christian emperor  In justice to the Romans it is proper to remark that they might possibly learn from the Greeks themselves the disingenuous practice of falsifying the statues of ancient worthies We know that Rhodes one of the most magnificent marts of sculpture in the Pagan world incurred considerable disgrace by this species of falsehood for which Dio Chrysostom reproves the Rhodians in a very copious animated and beautiful  oration which contains some interesting anecdotes of sculpture and an eloquent description of its influence on the spirit of antiquity  says the indignant orator    DIONIS  Rhodiaca Oratio  p edit folio  The learned and judicious Casaubon joins with Photius in pronouncing this the best of all Dio's orations and gives the following just account of the orator's intentions  Tam prolixa oratione hoc unum agit ut Rhodiorum senatui ac populo morem dissuadeat qui apud eos obtinuerat statuas veteres transferendi ad aliorum honorem titulis mutatis surdo figurarum discrimine Non apud Rhodios solum haec consuetudo invaluerat verum etiam apud Graecos alios et Romanos quoque sed nullus fuit populus qui rem risu dignam adeo usu frequentavit atque iste cujus gloriae cum faveret Dioob tam absurdum institutum acerrime eum objurgavit  There is another oration of Dio relating to sculpture and particularly entertaining The orator with great dexterity expresses his surprise to the inhabitants of Corinth that a brazen statue of himself with which they had honoured him on his former visit about eleven years before had vanished from their citya subject of great delicacy and very gracefully treated particularly in the close of the oration  NOTE VII Ver  Hunted with fierce inquietude for more  Marcellus the plunderer of Syracuse was perhaps the mildest of Roman ravagers He is said to have dropped a tear of compassion on his conquest of that beautiful city Mr Pinkerton mentions an exquisite medallion supposed to be struck by Syracuse in honour of this compassionate victor  Essay on Medals vol i p  who tender as he was did not fail to play the Roman in carrying off the rich and tempting spoils in his power The nature of those spoils and the future consequences of such conduct are finely described in the following words of Livy  Marcellus captis Syracusis quum caetera in Sicilia tanta fide atque integritate composuisset ut non modo suam gloriam

seems to have dazzled even the philosophical spirits of antiquity and to have struck them blind to the predominant vices of her national character These were arrogance and rapacity vices generally stigmatized when they appear in an individual and certainly not deserving a censure less severe when  they form the characteristics of a nation Yet so fascinating is the pride of successful valour that the nation of antiquity most injurious in its conduct towards the rest of the world is often commended as an object for modern emulation The most flagrant enormities of which the governors of France both regal and republican have been guilty seem to have been greatly owing to an indiscriminate and fantastic imitation of Roman spirit with a preposterous passion sometimes concealed and sometimes avowed for universal dominion The French appear to believe the Romans to have been what they supposed themselves to be a divine race of men destined by superior virtue to subdue the other nations of the earth or to use the words of their elegant but servile flatterer Virgil  progeniem virtute futuram  Egregiam et totum quae viribus occupet orbem  Aeneid  lib vii  A Latin author of an age not so polished the Christian philosopher Arnobius who wrote with the indignant warmth of an African has drawn in the opposite point of view a forcible and faithful picture of the Romans in the questions with which he concludes his animated invective "Adversus Gentes"  Generis earn fuisse divini quisquamne hominum credat aut habuisse aequitatem diis dignam quae humanis sese discordiis inserens aliorum opes fregit aliis se praebuit exhibuitque fautricem libertatem his abstulit alios ad columen dominationis erexit quae ut una civitas emineret in humani generis perniciem nata orbem subjugavit innoxium  These prominent features in the national character of Rome are painted also with great fidelity and spirit by Montesquieu in his masterly sketch of her grandeur and decline particularly in the chapter  entitled  De la Conduite que les Romains tinrent pour soumettre tous les peuples  But the sublimest censure on the national conduct of Rome is that which Milton has passed upon it in his Paradise Regained where to exhibit her ambition in the most execrable point of view he makes the Archfiend propose it as a model in one of his insidious speeches to our Saviour  Aim

become almost proverbial from the speech he made concerning the works of Grecian art that he dispatched to Rome He threatened those to whose care he had entrusted this invaluable part of his booty that whatever articles they lost they should be bound to replace by new similar productions  Si eas perdidissent novas eos reddituros  VELLEIUS PATERCULUS  Dio Chrysostom in his Oration to the Corinthians very properly bestows on this Roman ravager the appellation of  and gives a few curious specimens of his absurd conduct concerning some particular statues that made a part of his Grecian plunder  NOTE X Ver  To die and not have seen the works he wrought    ARRIANI EPICTETUS lib i c  NOTE XI Ver  And shar'd the immortality they gave  The Abbé Guasco has well described the deep and lively interest that the Grecians took in the perfection of art and in the honour of its professors  L'autorité publique prenoit un intérêt très serieux à la perfection de l'art A'Thebes ainsi qu'à Athenes il y avoit des loix tendant à proteger et encourager les professeurs et des loix pénales et pecuniaires pour ceux qui faisoient de mauvais ouvrages elles défendoient même de s'occuper d'objets difformes ou communs  La consideration et les distinctions qu'on accordoit aux artistes dans la Grèce étoient trèspropres à les encourager loin d'être regardés comme des mercénaires à gage et des simples ouvriers on les considéroit comme des hommes distingués comme des esprits sublimes donés d'un génie divin enrichis per l'étude et polis par l'usage du monde ils étoient mis au niveau des

extraordinaire de voir leur statues à côtè de celles des heros et des rois  De l'Usage des Statues  p  The Greeks indeed in general paid such honours very justly to their sublime artists but the Grecian philosophers seem to have looked upon them with a very jealous not to say an evil eye Even Plato and Plutarch have occasionally spoken of artists with a sort of envious disrespect that is particularly unbecoming in men of such cultivated minds These two enlightened and benevolent philosophers might have reflected that an accomplished sculptor whose art is properly directed  may be considered like themselves as the true servant of moral philosophy  A nation can hardly honour too highly the successful professors of any refined and arduous art whose productions have an evident and graceful tendency to give elevation and dignity to national character since as Cicero says very nobly in his Oration pro Muraena  Omnes enim artes quae nobis populi studia conciliant et admirabilem dignitatem et pergratam utilitatem debent habere Summa dignitas est in iis qui militari laude antecellunt omnia enim quae sunt in imperio et in statu civitatis ab iis defendi et firmari putantur summa etiam utilitus siquidem eorum consilio et periculo cum republica tum etiam nostris rebus perfrui possumus  The true interest honour and lasting prosperity of a state seems to depend in great measure on preserving a due balance and reciprocal respect between arts and arms for wherever too strong a predilection for either prevails that very predilection though it produces a blaze of success in a single path of celebrity becomes a certain yet unsuspected source of future destruction Carthage was ruined by her passion for commerce and Rome by her fiercer passion for war  NOTE XII Ver  Spurns

deities whose statues were so rapaciously removed from their temples by the pride avarice or hypocrisy of Pagan conquerors There is a passage  towards the end of this Treatise which paints the Romans

upright and independent lover of learning contemplated the character of Augustus are forcibly displayed in a manly and eloquent letter of Sir William Jones to Gibbon inserted in the Posthumous Works of the historian  Winkelmann and Guasco agree in the opinion that the statue of this emperor with naval insignia alluding to the victory at Actium is inferior to other productions of the same period  Among several laudable actions of this artful tyrant relating to sculpture I will not fail to notice one that is particularly deserving of praise He melted some silver statues of himself that servility had devoted to him and applied the coin they produced to the improvement of the public roads    DION CASSIUS vol i p  Mecaenas had given him the advice of a true friend not to permit any

Herodes Atticus the munificent citizen of Athens was the accomplished son of a most fortunate fathera father who had not only the rare good fortune to discover and obtain permission from the emperor Nerva to appropriate to his own family a concealed and inexhaustible treasure but the higher good fortune to find and successfully cultivate in his child those talents and virtues which instead of being corrupted by unbounded opulence rather appeared to derive from it new energy and lustre Herodes Atticus became not only the richest subject in the Roman empire but he was at the same time one of the most studious the most eloquent and liberal of men It was his noble maxim that the wealthy ought to employ their riches not only in relieving the necessities of the poor but in saving those of narrow circumstances from sinking into poverty Pausanias who lived at the same period has spoken with pleasure of the magnificent gifts bestowed by this generous Athenian on different parts of Greece The most remarkable were the Stadium that he formed at Athens of the finest marble extending six hundred feet and statues of singular beauty and splendor with which he decorated the temple of Neptune on the Isthmus of Corinth The Abbé Guasco without mentioning his authority asserts that this accomplished Athenian practised the art of sculpture himself  Le celèbre Hérode surnomme l'Attique ne crut pas se degrader en maniant luimême le ciseau et la Venus armée dont il fut l'auteur fait connoitre qu'il honoroit autant la sculpture par le bon gout de ses productions que par la dignité de sa personne  In consulting various ancient authors who have spoken of this interesting character and a modern Life of him by Mr Burigny in the Memoires of the French Academy I cannot find any farther proof of his having added a talent for sculpture to his other accomplishments and am therefore inclined to suppose that the Venus in question was a donation only and not a work of Herodes Its merit as a statue may be conceived from the following words of Damascius preserved in Photius    PHOTII  Bibliotheca  p  I cannot quit this memorable personage without observing with pleasure that after having obtained consular distinction at Rome and enjoyed the friendship of a virtuous Roman emperor he ended his days in a good old age seventysix at his favourite villa the illustrious spot of Marathon

the reviving cities of Greece and particularly to Athens is recorded by Pausanias and forcibly expressed in the two following verses that were engraved in the Acropolis    The magnificent public works and the motley character of this extraordinary emperor are singularly calculated to excite the opposite emotions of admiration and disgust His preposterous idea of deifying Antinous is sufficiently explained in the following words of the learned Spanheim  Le mignon d'Hadrien n'est que trop connu de l'historien de la vie de cet empereur des passages de quelques anciens peres de l'Eglise qui en font mention et entre autres d'Origéne en plusieurs endroits de son excellent livre centre Celsus et enfin par les temples les autels les sacrificateurs les jeux les statues qu' Hadrien lui fit

quoted by Plutarch              PLUTARCHUS in Vitis decem Oratorum  NOTE IV Ver  And Gratitude and Glory bless'd her aid  This very striking group of colossal statues erected to honour the Athenians

occasioned the death of its envious enemy and the subsequent divine honours that were paid to Theagenes when his image was restored according to an admonition from the Pythian oracle are piously related in the Sixth Book of Pausanias  NOTE VIII Ver  And as a guardian power this patriot Greek rever'd  Plutarch in his Life of Aratus has mentioned the statue of the hero and preserved its inscription  NOTE IX Ver  The friend who taught him virtue's noblest tone    DIOGENES LAERTIUS edit Lipsiae p  NOTE X Ver  By Aesop's statue Greece this lesson gave  A remark of the elegant and moral Phaedrus  Aesopo ingentem statuam posuere Attici  Servulumque collocarunt aeterna in basi  Patere honoris scirent ut cuncti viam  Nec generi tribui sed virtuti gloriam  This public memorial justly raised by the Athenians to the meritorious Aesop was the work of Lysippus The sculptor and the moralist are both applauded in a Greek epigram competed on this statue            Grotii Versio  Fictorum

be wise  We shun harsh counsel but this Samian sage  Of fable forms a feast for ev'ry age  NOTE XI Ver  Rever'd his glory as a public trust  Diogenes Laertius asserts in his Life of Socrates that the Athenians immediately repented their conduct towards the philosopher and honoured his memory by a public statue of brass the work of Lysippus It is remarkable that two men one esteemed the wisest and the other the wittiest of the Greeks Socrates and Lucian were bred to the profession of sculpture The vivacity of Lucian and his antipathy to a severe relation his master probably precluded that comic genius from making any considerable advances in an art which requires the steadiest union of industry and talent But Socrates is known to have executed some works as a statuary that were objects of public regard Pausanias has noticed the Graces in the Acropolis of Athens as the work of the philosopher and in observing that these and the elder Golden Graces of Bupalus were not destitute of drapery he professes himself unable to discover what artist introduced the custom prevalent in his time of representing the Graces naked Falconet imagines that statues executed by Socrates could have but a trifling degree of merit as works of art from the philosopher's having quitted the profession very early in life but the more candid Greeks seem inclined to applaud the laudable endeavours of juvenile talent and a Greek epigram on a very young sculptor Eutychides speaks of him as equal to Praxiteles though calamitously hurried out of life at the age of sixteen      NOTE XII Ver  And rail'd at statues rais'd in woman's name  Let me introduce the just and polite Guasco defending the fair sex against the asperity of the Roman censor  Caton le censeur toujours zélépour le maintien des maximes primordiales et peutêtre quelquefois un peu sujet à l'humeur blamoit comme un abus les statues qu'on dressoit aux dames Romaines dans les provinces le regardant comme chose contraire aux vieilles maximes de la simplicité et de la décence des moeurs cependant les blâmes de Caton ne parvinrent point à arrêter cette pratique même dans la capitale de l'empire  Plutarque aussi pholosophe mais plus galant que Caton sans parler de ce dernier mais probablement dans l'intention de le refuter fait l'apologie des monumens élévés en l'honneur des femmes illustres  "Dans le Traité des Femmes Vertueuses"  et soutient qu'elles avoient droit aussi bien que les hommes aux monumens qui font vivre dans la postérité toutes les fois qu'elles les avoient mérités par des vertus et des actions brillantes ajoutant plusieurs exemples qui prouvent que la vertu du beau sexe peut être aussi utile à l'état que celle des hommes En effet s'il arrive que s'élevant audessus de sa foiblesse naturelle

maternal character in ancient Rome Her sons and the people seem to have sympathized in affectionate veneration towards this illustrious woman and a statue was raised to the living parent with that

and conveyed to their own city by the victorious Imilcar A more powerful Roman conqueror seized it again in the spoils of Carthage and according to Cicero who mentions the circumstance in his Orations against Verres restored it to the inhabitants of Agrigentum  NOTE XX Ver  Of vile obscenity the venal tool  I have read of a statuary who signalized himself at Rome by this abuse of his art but his name escaped my recollection and it is better forgotten than remembered  NOTE XXI Ver  Of ancient genius give a wider view  Admiratur et Pasiteles says Pliny qui et quinque volumina scripsit nobilium

may be gratified in comparing what the French sculptor Falconet and his countryman M de la Nauze have said one to depreciate and the other to magnify the merits of Pliny as a writer upon art Perhaps the spirit of that indefatigable and illustrious Roman if we could question him on the subject would equally smile at the bitter detraction and the exaggerated praise confessing ingenuously that he really deserved neither the one nor the other In his great and unfinished work it is certainly not difficult to find some considerable imperfections yet taken altogether it is a most valuable and glorious monument of industry intelligence and goodnature  NOTE XXIII Ver  Thy Panorama of enchanting Greece  The character of Pausanias is very justly delineated by M de Caylus  Rien n'est plus capable de fixer nos idées sur la magnificence des Grecs sur la manière dont ils ont cultivé les arts que le recit de Pausanias Ce voyageur celebre a vû dans differentes parties de la Grèce qu'il a

preuves de son amour pour la vérité  Antiquités  tom ii p  It is to be regretted that we know so little concerning the personal history of a traveller to whom we are so highly indebted for a mass of most interesting information it appears however from a passage in his work that he wrote his Grecian Travels in the sixteenth year of the latter Antonine and from his mentioning no emperor of a later date he is supposed to have died in his reign  NOTE XXIV Ver  And moral beauty decorates the whole  The Latin folio of Francis Junius De Pictura Veterum is a work of extensive erudition and equal philanthropy The very studious and amiable author was born in the Palatinate he first embraced the profession of arms but soon quitted it on the establishment of peace and after travelling to France he visited England and resided for thirty years in the family of that illustrious lover of art the celebrated earl of Arundel a circumstance peculiarly favourable to his elaborate production The first edition of it was printed in Holland but the second with many additions and a life of the author by Graevius was published in London  A letter from Grotius dated Paris in returning thanks to Junius for a copy of his book contains the following judicious and elegant description of its merit  Miror diffusam lectionem judicium ordinem quae ex cunctis artibus ad hanc artem ornandam attulisti Plane simile mihi videtur hoc opus tuum illis imaginibus quae e lapillis diversicoloribus compaginatis fiunt qualis illa Satyri Epigrammate Graeco celebrata Theuderici Gothorum regis memorata Procopio Delectat varietas multoque magis ex ista varietate consurgens pulchra species Rogo te ut multa des nobis similia  Junius died at Windsor in the house of his nephew Vossius and the university of Oxford to whom this most mild and laborious scholar bequeathed his books has honoured his memory with an epitaph that contains the following very pleasing eulogy  Per omnem aetatem  Sine querela aut injuria cujusquam  Musis tantum et sibi vacavit  NOTE XXV Ver  And sunk from glorious toil to dark repose  The abbée Guasco had the misfortune to have his studies for a long time suspended and at last terminated by a calamity peculiarly severe to a man of lettersthe failure of his sight He modestly closes his learned and interesting work upon Statues with the following pathetic apology  Forcé par la perte de ma vue de quitter la plume je vais vivre dans un repos auquel les lettres ne perdront rien Je crains même que cet ouvrage ne soit une preuve que j'aurois du m'y livrer plutôt d'autant plus que mon état ne me permet point de revoir corriger ce que  j'ecrivis il y a dix ans que je différois toujours de publier dans l'espérance trompeuse de pouvoir y donner encore la derniere main  De l'Usage des Statues  p  The preface to the book I have just cited contains some pleasing letters between the author and his brother an officer of distinction whom he had the misfortune to survive The abbé was an honorary member of the French Academy and he lived on terms of great intimacy with Montesquieu as I discover from a little volume of letters that he published soon after the decease and with the name of his illustrious friend  NOTE XXVI Ver  Each changeful feature and her inmost soul  Though the eager enthusiastic spirit of Winkelman exposed him occasionally to delusion and to ridicule there is such a portion of solid and of splendid merit in his great work the History of Art as can hardly fail to confer upon its author an honourable immortality The excellencies and the failings of this animated writer are candidly displayed in the eulogy inscribed to him by his accomplished friend Heyne the professor of Gottingen In the copious tide of translations from the German which has recently enriched the literature of our country it is matter of surprise and regret to those who delight in the arts that the works of Winkelman have not yet made their appearance He has found creditable translators both in France and Italy Time will probably produce a collection of all his different works on design in a becoming English dress with a suitable account of a writer whose productions  are replete with learning taste and genius and whose personal history is particularly interesting  What an incentive to studious youth in the humble classes of life to trace the son of a German cobler overcoming the perplexities of indigent obscurity and qualifying himself to instruct the connoisseurs of Italy and to preside over the antiquities of Rome He was born at Stendal in Brandenburgh and stabbed at Trieste by an itinerant Italian who vainly hoped to rob him of some valuable metals that he had received as a present on his visit to the court of Vienna  Winkelman notwithstanding the many wounds he received lived long enough to forgive his assassin and to bequeath his property to his illustrious friend and patron cardinal Alexander Albani  NOTE XXVII Ver  And charm'd thy spirit thro' the shades of death  The delight and advantages arising from a lively and liberal passion for the fine arts were never more forcibly exemplified than in the youthful and in the declining days of that accomplished nobleman the Comte de Caylus Born of a very illustrious family in he began his career of public life as a soldier but on the peace of Rastadt he amused his active spirit by travelling to Italy In the course of his excursion he made a frank offer of his sword in defence of Malta then threatened by the Turks the alarm of that island passed away and the count returned to Paris The love of travelling and a passionate attachment to the study of antiquities now induced him to relinquish his military profession He wished to visit the scenes of ancient art and  seized the opportunity of embarking for the east with a new embassador from his country to Constantinople As they stopt at Smyrna he was eager to survey the ruins of Ephesus their distance from Smyrna was only the journey of a day His friends endeavoured to dissuade him from attempting it by displaying the danger he must incur as the country was infested by a merciless banditti under a formidable chief Caracayali  But in the Comte de Caylus says his Eulogist fear was always subordinate to desire He accomplished his wishes by an adventurous device clothing himself in a simple linen dress and taking with him nothing that could tempt rapacity he set forth with two of the banditti who were suffered from motives of public apprehension to visit Smyrna occasionally He had made a bargain with these men on a promise of paying them liberally on his safe return They conducted him with an interpreter to their captain Caracayali pleased with his animated visitor took a pleasure in gratifying his curiosity He told him there were ruins still nearer that deserved his attention and to convey him thither with the utmost celerity he supplied him with two of the finest Arabian coursers The Comte seemed to be transported by magic to the interesting spot it presented to him the ruins of Colopton After enjoying that unexpected and delightful scene he returned to pass the night in a fort that formed the residence of Caracayali and the next day he devoted to the ruins of Ephesus Of the state in which he found the famous temple of Diana he has left a memoir but the nature of my present work does not allow me to dwell on the extended life and numerous productions of this engaging character I hasten to speak of his latter days After returning to France and visiting London more than once after passing many years in active though sedentary life in various compositions particularly his Academical Memoirs on different Branches of Painting and Sculpture and his very comprehensive  Collection of Antiquities this amiable practical student and munificent patron of art began in to shew that his robust frame was tending to dissolution He triumphed for some time over the corporeal miseries of decaying nature by the exertions of an active enlightened and affectionate spirit"Il visita" says his eloquent eulogist M le Beau from whom I have drawn this brief account of his interesting hero  il visita ses amis les sçavans les artistes dont il alloit animer les travaux tandis qu'il mouroit luimême Tout étoit mort en lui mais l'amour des lettres respiroit encoreIl expira L'Academie les arts le monde literaire ont perdu leur plus vif encouragement une resource toujours active leur plus zélé bienfaiteur  Eloge Historique de M le Comte de Caylus  NOTE XXVIII Ver  But which may best befriend art science truth and life  The incident which gave rise to the closing verses of this epistle is mentioned by M de Caylus himself in his Antiquities he expresses his gratitude to an unknown English gentleman who had surprised him with an unexpected present of several valuable works of art as a tribute of respect to his beneficent character taking at the same time the greatest precautions that his own beneficence might remain anonymous  This English gentleman was I believe the late Mr Hollis whose life was uncommonly devoted to the continual exercise of refined liberality  Many readers will smile at the romantic spirit of the wish which concludes this Epistle and which however suggested by considerate humanity  and genuine patriotism the temper of the times is so likely to realize  Yet war is one of those universally afflicting and universally execrated evils to which both the spirit and the letter of Christianity seem to promise a perfect antidoteits efficacy as such is certainly not visible at present but it is still a comfort to a humane and contemplative mind to reflect that its operation however slow must be ultimately successful  END OF THE NOTES ON THE FIFTH EPISTLE  NOTES ON THE  SIXTH EPISTLE  NOTE I Ver  THE simple grandeur of her seaman's heart  The character of the British seaman is perhaps the most perfect and preeminent of all professional characters or in other words the character possesses in the highest degree the peculiar and varied excellencies which the profession requires yet though it is universally allowed that no class of men have been more zealous or successful in the pursuit of glory perhaps none have been so scantily requited with those memorials of merit which are necessary to make glory what Thucydides very happily called ita possession for ever May the justice and spirit of the nation be animated to such a completion of the projected naval monument as may most gratify our present heroes and most happily produce to our country in a future age a similar succession of defenders  Demosthenes has eloquently displayed this grand use of public monuments in closing his Oration for the liberty of the Rhodians    The Abbé Guasco has made some just remarks on the statues of antiquity equally applicable to this interesting subject  Il seroit à souhaiter que ceux à qui la dispensation des recompenses et des temoignages d'estime publique est confiée ne perdissent jamais de vue les idées des anciens à cet égard Chez eux c'étoit l'interet même de la patrie qui exigeoit et reclamoit les monumens

the more remarkable as the dear sufferer was at the time reduced to such decrepitude that he was obliged to endure a great increase of pain whenever he indulged his fancy in a brief constrained and hasty use of the pencil Yet under these severe disadvantages he executed some original designs that are thought by less partial judges to promise great future excellence if Heaven graciously restores him from a state of the most calamitous and complicated sufferings which he has now supported for more  than two years with the mildest magnanimity My reader has an opportunity of judging if I speak too partially of the designs executed by this dear invalid as the Death of Demosthenes which he drew reclining himself on the couch of pain for the affectionate purpose of decorating this Poem is one of those I allude to He will at the same time have the candour to recollect that this design is literally the production of a youth severely obstructed in the exercise of early talent and that  the sculptor's art by which is not meant merely finishing his compositions in marble but forming with correctness figures in any material demands infinite labour and patience and maturity of life to carry it to perfection  I borrow the words of an admirable little Treatise intitled "Thoughts on Outline Sculpture c" by Mr George Cumberland an author who can employ with alternate and masterly command both the pen and the pencil  NOTE III Ver  And sighing bids the imperfect paean close  I could wish yet I must not expect such a wish can be realized that all readers who may be subject to affliction like that which has made the close of this Poem so different from what the author meant it to be when the Work was begun might find in the perusal of it a lenient relief similar to what I have found when I could force myself to pursue a composition frequently interrupted by paternal anxiety and frequently resumed from the influence of the same powerful affection to gratify an intelligent and generous invalid He often requested me to pursue my Work at a little distance from him that it might save me from sympathising too intensely in pangs that I could  not relieve Sometimes I could obey his tender injunctions and sometimes I have been almost on the point of exclaiming in the pathetic words of Virgil  Bis patriae cecidere manus  But at last through a long vicissitude of hopes and fears for health infinitely dearer to me than my own I am arrived at the close of the Work which this beloved promoter of my suspended studies has so kindly wished me to complete I deliver it to the candour of the Public not insensible of its imperfections yet with feelings of gratitude to the great Giver of all gifts that under the bitterest disquietude and distress of heart he has still granted me such powers of application as have enabled me to sooth the corporeal anguish of a most meritorious and longsuffering child and to beguile many many hours of paternal affection  THE END OF THE NOTES  POSTSCRIPT TO  MR FLAXMAN  WHEN the tide of affliction begins to flow how dark and deep is the current  In a few days after I had dispatched to the press the MS of the introductory letter prefixed to this Poem I received the affecting intelligence that my enchanting and inestimable friend Cowper had expired and your beloved disciple followed within a week that dear departed genius who had honoured his childhood with the tenderest regard  I have now to thank you my excellent compassionate friend for a very hasty but a very kind visit to the dear deceased object of our welldeserved affection and regret  I am not afraid of your thinking that I exaggerate his merit and speak too long or too loudly on a most dutiful child and a most diligent disciple to us indeed his juvenile talents and virtues had endeared him to such a degree that our hearts I believe are perfectly in unison while they reecho his praise  If the mournful delight that I take in commemorating his excellence has tempted me to obtrude too much of his commendation on the eye of the Public I trust that the benevolent spirit of my country will indulgently accept the following apology  SONNET  England kind parent Freedom's fav'rite trust  Honour's prime pupil Nature's noblest care  Thy feelings rapid as thy virtues rare  Blame not my pride that o'er the filial dust  Of youth now claiming the sepulchral bust  I ask thy spirit in my grief to share  For like thy heart and mind  His  truly were  Brave modest tender charitable just  His docile genius with fond joy I train'd  To love thy glory and thy faith revere  Nor will I murmur though my frequent tear  Proclaims the Dead unutterably dear  So may I share with him what he has gain'd  The recompence of Heaven for anguish well sustain'd  THE END  Printed by A
