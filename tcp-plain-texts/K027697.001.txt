 THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY GENTLEMAN  VOL I  The SECOND EDITION  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY in  PallMall  MDCCLX  To the Right Honourable Mr PITT  SIR  NEVER poor Wight of a Dedicator had less hopes from his Dedication than I have from this of mine for it is written in a bye corner of the kingdom and in a retired thatch'd house where I live in a constant endeavour to fence against the infirmities of ill health and other evils of lise by  mirth being firmly persuaded that every time a man smilesbut much more so when he laughs that it adds something to this Fragment of Life  I humbly beg Sir that you will honour this book by taking itnot under your Protectionit must protect itself butinto the country with you where if I am ever told it has made you smile or can conceive it has beguiled you of one moment's painI shall think myself as happy as a minister of stateperhaps much happier than any  one one only excepted that I have ever read or heard of  I am great Sir and what is more to your Honour I am good Sir  Your Wellwisher and most humble FellowSubject THE AUTHOR  THE LIFE and OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY Gent  CHAP I  I Wish either my father or my mother or indeed both of them as they were in duty both equally bound to it had minded what they were about when they begot me had they duly consider'd how much depended upon what they were then doingthat not only the production of a rational Being was concern'd in it but that possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body  perhaps his genius and the very cast of his mindand for aught they knew to the contrary even the fortunes of his whole house might take their turn from the humours and dispositions which were then uppermostHad they duly weighed and considered all this and proceeded accordinglyI am verily persuaded I should have made a quite different figure in the world from that in which the reader is likely to see meBelieve me good folks this is not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think ityou have all I dare say heard of the animal spirits as how they are transfused from father to son c cand a great deal to that purposeWell you may take my word that nine parts in ten of a man's sense or his nonsense his successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon their motions and activity  and the different tracks and trains you put them into so that when they are once set a going whether right or wrong 'tis not a half penny matteraway they go cluttering like heygomad and by treading the same steps over and over again they presently make a road of it as plain and as smooth as a gardenwalk which when they are once used to the Devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it  Pray    my dear  quoth my mother  have you not forgot to wind up the clock    Good G    cried my father making an exclamation but taking care to moderate his voice at the same time  Did ever woman    since the creation of the world    interrupt a man with such a silly question  Pray what was your father sayingNothing  CHAP II  Then positively there is nothing in the question that I can see either good or badThen let me tell you Sir it was a very unseasonable question at leastbecause it scattered and dispersed the animal spirits whose business it was to have escorted and gone handinhand with the  HOMUNCULUS  and conducted him safe to the place destined for his reception  The HOMUNCULUS Sir in however low and ludicrous a light he may appear in this age of levity to the eye of folly or prejudiceto the eye of reason in scientifick research he stands confess'da BEING guarded and circumscribed with rightsThe minutest philosophers  who by the bye have the most enlarged understandings their souls being inversely as their enquiries shew us incontestably That the HOMUNCULUS is created by the same handengender'd in the same course of natureendowed with the same locomotive powers and faculties with usThat he consists as we do of skin hair fat flesh veins arteries ligaments nerves cartileges bones marrow brains glands genitals humours and articulationsis a Being of as much activityand in all senses of the word as much and as truly our fellowcreature as my Lord Chancellor of EnglandHe may be benefited he may be injuredhe may obtain redressin a word he has all the claims and rights of humanity which  Tully    Puffendorff  or the best ethick writers  allow to arise out of that state and relation  Now dear Sir what if any accident had befallen him in his way aloneor that thro' terror of it natural to so young a traveller my little gentleman had got to his journey's end miserably spenthis muscular strength and virility worn down to a threadhis own animal spirits ruffled beyond descriptionand that in this sad disorder'd state of nerves he had laid down a prey to sudden starts or a series of melancholy dreams and fancies for nine long long months togetherI tremble to think what a foundation had been laid for a thousand weaknesses both of body and mind which no skill of the physician or the philosopher could ever afterwards have set thoroughly to rights  CHAP III  TO my uncle Mr  Toby Shandy  do I stand indebted for the preceding anecdote to whom my father who was an excellent natural philosopher and much given to close reasoning upon the smallest matters had oft and heavily complain'd of the injury but once more particularly as my uncle  Toby  well remember'd upon his observing a most unaccountable obliquity as he call'd it in my manner of setting up my top and justifying the principles upon which I had done itthe old gentleman shook his head and in a tone more expressive by half of sorrow than reproachhe said his heart all along foreboded and he saw it verified in this and from a thousand other observations he had made upon  me That I should neither think nor act like any other man's child  But alas  continued he shaking his head a second time and wiping away a tear which was trickling down his cheeks  My Tristram's misfortunes began nine months before ever he came into the world  My mother who was sitting by look'd upbut she knew no more than her backside what my father meantbut my uncle Mr  Toby Shandy  who had been often informed of the affairunderstood him very well  CHAP IV  I Know there are readers in the world as well as many other good people in it who are no readers at allwho  find themselves ill at ease unless they are let into the whole secret from first to last of every thing which concerns you  It is in pure compliance with this humour of theirs and from a backwardness in my nature to disappoint any one soul living that I have been so very particular already As my life and opinions are likely to make some noise in the world and if I conjecture right will take in all ranks professions and denominations of men whateverbe no less read than the  Pilgrim's Progress  itselfand in the end prove the very thing which  Montaigne  dreaded his essays should turn out that is a book for a parlourwindowI find it necessary to consult every one a little in his turn and therefore must beg pardon for going on a little further in the same way For which cause right glad  I am that I have begun the history of myself in the way I have done and that I am able to go on tracing every thing in it as  Horace  says  ab Ovo  Horace  I know does not recommend this fashion altogether But that gentleman is speaking only of an epic poem or a tragedyI forget whichbesides if it was not so I should beg Mr  Horace  's pardonfor in writing what I have set about I shall confine myself neither to his rules nor to any man's rules that ever lived  To such however as do not choose to go so far back into these things I can give no better advice than that they skip over the remaining part of this Chapter for I declare before hand 'tis  wrote only for the curious and inquisitive  Shut the doorI was begot in the night betwixt the first  Sunday  and the first  Monday  in the month of  March  in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighteen I am positive I wasBut how I came to be so very particular in my account of a thing which happened before I was born is owing to another small anecdote known only in our own family but now made publick for the better clearing up this point  My father you must know who was originally a  Turkey  merchant but had left off business for some years in order to retire to and die upon his paternal estate in the county of  was I believe  one of the most regular men in every thing he did whether 'twas matter of business or matter of amusement that ever lived As a small specimen of this extreme exactness of his to which he was in truth a slavehe had made it a rule for many years of his lifeon the first  Sunday night  of every month throughout the whole yearas certain as ever the  Sunday night  cameto wind up a large houseclock which we had standing upon the backstairs head with his own handsAnd being somewhere between fifty and sixty years of age at the time I have been speaking ofhe had likewise gradually brought some other little family concernments to the same period in order as he would often say to my uncle  Toby  to get them all out of the way at one time and be no more plagued  and pester'd with them the rest of the month  It was attended but with one misfortune which in a great measure fell upon myself and the effects of which I fear I shall carry with me to my grave namely that from an unhappy association of ideas which have no connection in nature it so fell out at length that my poor mother could never hear the said clock wound upbut the thoughts of some other things unavoidably popp'd into her head  vice vers√¢  which strange combination of ideas the sagacious  Locke  who certainly understood the nature of these things better than most men affirms to have produced more wry actions than all other sources of prejudice whatsoever  But this by the bye  Now it appears by a memorandum in my father's pocketbook which now lies upon the table "That on  LadyDay  which was on the th of the same month in which I date my genituremy father set out upon his journey to  London  with my eldest brother  Bobby  to fix him at  Westminster  school" and as it appears from the same authority "That he did not get down to his wife and family till the  second week  in  May  following"it brings the thing almost to a certainty However what follows in the beginning of the next chapter puts it beyond all possibility of doubt  But pray Sir What was your father doing all  December    January  and  February  Why Madamhe was all that time afflicted with a Sciatica  CHAP V  ON the fifth day of  November  which to the aera fixed on was as near nine kalendar months as any husband could in reason have expectedwas I  Tristram Shandy  Gentleman brought forth into this scurvy and disasterous world of oursI wish I had been born in the Moon or in any of the planets except  Jupiter  or  Saturn  because I never could bear cold weather for it could not well have fared worse with me in any of them tho' I will not answer for  Venus  than it has in this vile dirty planet of ourswhich o' my conscience with reverence be it spoken I take to be made up of the shreds and clippings of the restnot but the planet is well enough provided a man could be born  in it to a great title or to a great estate or could any how contrive to be called up to publick charges and employments of dignity or powerbut that is not my caseand therefore every man will speak of the fair as his own market has gone in itfor which cause I affirm it over again to be one of the vilest worlds that ever was madefor I can truly say that from the first hour I drew my breath in it to this that I can now scarce draw it at all for an asthma I got in scating against the wind in  Flanders  I have been the continual sport of what the world calls fortune and though I will not wrong her by saying She has ever made me feel the weight of any great or signal evilyet with all the good temper in the world I affirm it of her that in every stage of my life and ate very turn and corner where she could  get fairly at me the ungracious Duchess has pelted me with a set of as pitiful misadventures and cross accidents as ever small HERO sustained  CHAP VI  IN the beginning of the last chapter I inform'd you exactly  when  I was bornbut I did not inform you  how No  that particular was reserved entirely for a chapter by itselfbesides Sir as you and I are in a manner perfect strangers to each other it would not have been proper to have let you into too many circumstances relating to myself all at onceYou must have a little patience I have undertaken you see to write not only my life but my opinions also hoping and expecting that your knowledge  of my character and of what kind of a mortal I am by the one would give you a better relish for the other As you proceed further with me the slight acquaintance which is now beginning betwixt us will grow into familiarity and that unless one of us is in fault will terminate in friendship  O diem praeclarum  then nothing which has touched me will be thought trifling in its nature or tedious in its telling Therefore my dear friend and companion if you should think me somewhat sparing of my narrative on my first setting outbear with meand let me go on and tell my story my own wayor if I should seem now and then to trifle upon the roador should sometimes put on a fool's cap with a bell to it for a moment or two as we pass alongdon't fly offbut rather courteously give me  credit for a little more wisdom than appears upon my outsideand as we jogg on either laugh with me or at me or in short do any thingonly keep your temper  CHAP VII  IN the same village where my father and my mother dwelt dwelt also a thin upright motherly notable good old body of a midwife who with the help of a little plain good sense and some years full employment in her business in which she had all along trusted little to her own efforts and a great deal to those of dame naturehad acquired in her way no small degree of reputation in the worldby which word  world  need I in this place inform your worship  that I would be understood to mean no more of it than a small circle described upon the circle of the great world of four  English  miles diameter or thereabouts of which the cottage where the good old woman lived is supposed to be the centreShe had been left it seems a widow in great distress with three or four small children in her fortyseventh year and as she was at that time a person of decent carriagegrave deportmenta woman moreover of few words and withall an object of compassion whose distress and silence under it call'd out the louder for a friendly lift the wife of the parson of the parish was touch'd with pity and having often lamented an inconvenience to which her husband's flock had for many years been exposed inasmuch as there was no such thing as a midwife of any kind or degree  to be got at let the case have been never so urgent within less than six or seven long miles riding which said seven long miles in dark nights and dismal roads the country thereabouts being nothing but a deep clay was almost equal to fourteen and that in effect was sometimes next to having no midwife at all it came into her head that it would be doing as seasonable a kindness to the whole parish as to the poor creature herself to get her a little instructed in some of the plain principles of the business in order to set her up in it As no woman thereabouts was better qualified to execute the plan she had formed than herself the Gentlewoman very charitably undertook it and having great influence over the female part of the parish she found no difficulty in effecting it to the utmost of her wishes In truth the parson join'd his interest  with his wife's in the whole affair and in order to do things as they should be and give the poor soul as good a title by law to practise as his wife had given by institutionhe chearfully paid the fees for the ordinaries licence himself amounting in the whole to the sum of eighteen shillings and fourpence so that betwixt them both the good woman was fully invested in the real and corporal possession of her office together with all its  rights    members    and appurtenances whatsoever  These last words you must know were not according to the old form in which such licences faculties and powers usually ran which in like cases had heretofore been granted to the sisterhood But it was according to a neat  Formula  of  Didius  his own devising who having  a particular turn for taking to pieces and new framing over again all kind of instruments in that way not only hit upon this dainty amendment but coax'd many of the old licensed matrons in the neighbourhood to open their faculties afresh in order to have this whimwham of his inserted  I own I never could envy  Didius  in these kinds of fancies of hisBut every man to his own tasteDid not Dr  Kunastrokius  that great man at his leisure hours take the greatest delight imaginable in combing of asses tails and plucking the dead hairs out with his teeth though he had tweezers always in his pocket Nay if you come to that Sir have not the wisest of men in all ages not excepting  Solomon  himselfhave they not had their HOBBYHORSEStheir running  horsestheir coins and their cockleshells their drums and their trumpets their fiddles their palletstheir maggots and their butterfliesand so long as a man rides his HOBBYHORSE peaceably and quietly along the King's highway and neither compels you or me to get up behind himpray Sir what have either you or I to do with it  CHAP VIII    Degustibus non est disputandum  that is there is no disputing against HOBBYHORSES and for my part I seldom do nor could I with any sort of grace had I been an enemy to them at the bottom for happening at certain intervals and changes of the Moon to be both fiddler and painter according as the fly stingsBe it known to you that I  keep a couple of pads myself upon which in their turns nor do I care who knows it I frequently ride out and take the airtho' sometimes to my shame be it spoken I take somewhat longer journies than what a wise man would think altogether rightBut the truth isI am not a wise manand besides am a mortal of so little consequence in the world it is not much matter what I do so I seldom fret or fume at all about it Nor does it much disturb my rest when I see such great Lords and tall Personages as hereafter followsuch for instance as my Lord A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q and so on all of a row mounted upon their several horsessome with large stirrups getting on in a more grave and sober paceothers on the contrary tuck'd up to their very chins with whips across  their mouths scouring and scampering it away like so many little partycolour'd devils astride a mortgageand as if some of them were resolved to break their necksSo much the bettersay I to myselffor in case the worst should happen the world will make a shift to do excellently well without themand for the restwhyGod speed theme'en let them ride on without opposition from me for were their lordships unhorsed this very night'tis ten to one but that many of them would be worse mounted by one half before tomorrow morning  Not one of these instances therefore can be said to break in upon my restBut there is an instance which I own puts me off my guard and that is when I see one born for great actions and what is  still more for his honour whose nature ever inclines him to good oneswhen I behold such a one my Lord like yourself whose principles and conduct are as generous and noble as his blood and whom for that reason a corrupt world cannot spare one momentwhen I see such a one my Lord mounted though it is but for a minute beyond the time which my love to my country has prescribed to him and my zeal for his glory wishesthen my Lord I cease to be a philosopher and in the first transport of an honest impatience I wish the HOBBYHORSE with all his fraternity at the Devil  My Lord  I Maintain this to be a dedication notwithstanding its singularity in the three great essentials of matter  form and place I beg therefore you will accept it as such and that you will permit me to lay it with the most respectful humility at your Lordship's feetwhen you are upon themwhich you can be when you pleaseand that is my Lord when ever there is occasion for it and I will add to the best purposes too I have the honour to be  My Lord  Your Lordship's most obedient and most devoted and most humble servant TRISTRAM SHANDY  CHAP IX  I Solemnly declare to all mankind that the above dedication was made for no one Prince Prelate Pope or PotentateDuke Marquis Earl Viscount or Baron of this or any other Realm in Christendomnor has it yet been hawk'd about or offered publickly or privately directly or indirectly to any one person or personage great or small but is honestly a true VirginDedication untried on upon any soul living  I labour this point so particularly merely to remove any offence or objection which might arise against it from the manner in which I propose to make the most of itwhich is the putting  it up fairly to publick sale which I now do  Every author has a way of his own in bringing his points to bearfor my own part as I hate chaffering and higgling for a few guineas in a dark entryI resolved within myself from the very beginning to deal squarely and openly with your Great Folks in this affair and try whether I should not come off the better by it  If therefore there is any one Duke Marquis Earl Viscount or Baron in these his Majesty's dominions who stands in need of a tight genteel dedication and whom the above will suit for by the bye unless it suits in some degree I will not part with itit is much at his service for fifty guineaswhich  I am positive is twenty guineas less than it ought to be afforded for by any man of genius  My Lord if you examine it over again it is far from being a gross piece of daubing as some dedications are The design your Lordship sees is good the colouring transparentthe drawing not amissor to speak more like a man of scienceand measure my piece in the painter's scale divided into I believe my Lord the outlines will turn out as the composition as the colouring as the expression and a halfand the designif I may be allowed my Lord to understand my own  design  and supposing absolute perfection in designing to be as I think it cannot well fall short of Besides all thisthere is keeping in it and  the dark strokes in the HOBBYHORSE which is a secondary figure and a kind of background to the whole give great force to the principal lights in your own figure and make it come off wonderfullyand besides there is an air of originality in the  tout ensemble  Be pleased my good Lord to order the sum to be paid into the hands of Mr  Dodsley  for the benefit of the author and in the next edition care shall be taken that this chapter be expunged and your Lordship's titles distinctions arms and good actions be placed at the front of the preceding chapter All which from the words  De gustibus non est disputandum  and whatever else in this book relates to HOBBYHORSES but no more shall stand dedicated to your LordshipThe rest I dedicate to the MOON who by  the bye of all the PATRONS or MATRONS I can think of has most power to set my book agoing and make the world run mad after it  Bright Goddess    If thou art not too busy with CANDID and Miss CUNEGUND's affairstake  Tristram Shandy  's under thy protection also  CHAP X  WHatever degree of small merit the act of benignity in favour of the midwife might justly claim or in whom that claim truly restedat first sight seems not very material to this historycertain however it was that the gentlewoman the parson's wife did run away at that time with the whole of it And yet for my life I cannot help thinking but that the parson himself  tho' he had not the good fortune to hit upon the design firstyet as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was laid before him and as heartily parted with his money to carry it into execution had a claim to some share of itif not to a full half of whatever honour was due to it  The world at that time was pleased to determine the matter otherwise  Lay down the book and I will allow you half a day to give a probable guess at the grounds of this procedure  Be it known then that for about five years before the date of the midwife's licence of which you have had so circumstantial an accountthe parson we have to do with had made himself a  countrytalk by a breach of all decorum which he had committed against himself his station and his officeand that was in never appearing better or otherwise mounted than upon a lean sorry jackass of a horse value about one pound fifteen shillings who to shorten all description of him was full brother to  Rosinante  as far as similitude congenial could make him for he answered his description to a hairbreadth in every thingexcept that I do not remember 'tis any where said that  Rosinante  was broken winded and that moreover  Rosinante  as is the happiness of most  Spanish  horses fat or leanwas undoubtedly a horse at all points  I know very well that the HERO'S horse was a horse of chaste deportment which may have given grounds for a  contrary opinion But it is as certain at the same time that  Rosinante  's continency as may be demonstrated from the adventure of the  Yanguesian  carriers proceeded from no bodily defect or cause whatsoever but from the temperance and orderly current of his bloodAnd let me tell you Madam there is a great deal of very good chastity in the world in behalf of which you could not say more for your life  Let that be as it may as my purpose is to do exact justice to every creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic workI could not stifle this distinction in favour of Don  Quixote  's horsein all other points the parson's horse I say was just such anotherfor he was as lean and as lank and as sorry a jade as HUMILITY herself could have bestrided  In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment it was greatly in the parson's power to have helped the figure of this horse of hisfor he was master of a very handsome demipeak'd saddle quilted on the seat with green plush garnished with a double row of silverheaded studs and a noble pair of shining brass stirrups with a housing altogether suitable of grey superfine cloth with an edging of black lace terminating in a deep black silk fringe  poudr√® d'or  all which he had purchased in the pride and prime of his life together with a grand embossed bridle ornamented at all points as it should beBut not caring to banter his beast he had hung all these up behind his study doorand in lieu of them had seriously befitted him with just such a bridle and such  a saddle as the figure and value of such a steed might well and truly deserve  In the several sallies about his parish and in the neighbouring visits to the gentry who lived around himyou will easily comprehend that the parson so appointed would both hear and see enough to keep his philosophy from rusting To speak the truth he never could enter a village but he caught the attention of both old and youngLabour stood still as he pass'dthe bucket hung suspended in the middle of the wellthe spinningwheel forgot its roundeven chuckfarthing and shufflecap themselves stood gaping till he had got out of sight and as his movement was not of the quickest he had generally time enough upon his hands to make his observationsto hear  the groans of the seriousand the laughter of the lightheartedall which he bore with excellent tranquilityHis character washe loved a jest in his heartand as he saw himself in the true point of ridicule he would say he could not be angry with others for seeing him in a light in which he so strongly saw himself So that to his friends who knew his foible was not the love of money and who therefore made the less scruple in bantering the extravagance of his humourinstead of giving the true causehe chose rather to join in the laugh against himself and as he never carried one single ounce of flesh upon his own bones being altogether as spare a figure as his beasthe would sometimes insist upon it that the horse was as good as the rider deservedthat they were centaurlikeboth of a piece At other  times and in other moods when his spirits were above the temptation of false withe would say he found himself going off fast in a consumption and with great gravity would pretend he could not bear the sight of a fat horse without a dejection of heart and a sensible alteration in his pulse and that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon not only to keep himself in countenance but in spirits  At different times he would give fifty humourous and opposite reasons for riding a meekspirited jade of a brokenwinded horse preferably to one of mettlefor on such a one he could sit mechanically and meditate as delightfully  de vanitate mundi et fug√¢ saeculi  as with the advantage of a death's head before himthat in all other exercitations he  could spend his time as he rode slowly alongto as much account as in his studythat he could draw up an argument in his sermonor a hole in his breeches as steadily on the one as in the otherthat brisk trotting and slow argumentation like wit and judgment were two incompatible movementsBut that upon his steedhe could unite and reconcile every thinghe could compose his sermonhe could compose his coughand in case nature gave a call that way he could likewise compose himself to sleepIn short the parson upon such encounters would assign any cause but the true causeand he withheld the true one only out of a nicety of temper because he thought it did honour to him  But the truth of the story was as follows In the first years of this gentleman's life and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle were purchased by him it had been his manner or vanity or call it what you willto run into the opposite extreamIn the language of the county where he dwelt he was said to have loved a good horse and generally had one of the best in the whole parish standing in his stable always ready for saddling and as the nearest midwife as I told you did not live nearer to the village than seven miles and in a vile countryit so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous application for his beast and as he was not an unkindhearted man and every case was more pressing and more distressful than the lastas much as he loved his beast  he had never a heart to refuse him the upshot of which was generally this that his horse was either clapp'd or spavin'd or greaz'dor he was twitterbon'd or brokenwinded or something in short or other had befallen him which would let him carry no fleshso that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid ofand a good horse to purchase in his stead  What the loss in such a balance might amount to  communibus annis  I would leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffic to determinebut let it be what it would the honest gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur till at length by repeated ill accidents of the kind he found it necessary to take the thing under consideration and upon weighing the whole and summing it up  in his mind he found it not only disproportion'd to his other expences but withall so heavy an article in itself as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish Besides this he considered that with half the sum thus galloped away he could do ten times as much goodand what still weighed more with him than all other considerations put together was this that it confined all his charity into one particular channel and where as he fancied it was the least wanted namely to the childbearing and childgetting part of his parish reserving nothing for the impotentnothing for the agednothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit where poverty and sickness and affliction dwelt together  For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence and there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of itand these were either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his steed upon any application whateveror else be content to ride the last poor devil such as they had made him with all his aches and infirmities to the very end of the chapter  As he dreaded his own constancy in the firsthe very chearfully betook himself to the second and tho' he could very well have explain'd it as I said to his honouryet for that very reason he had a spirit above it choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies and the laughter of his friends than undergo the pain of telling a story which might seem a panegyric upon himself  I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this reverend gentleman from this single stroke in his character which I think comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of  La Mancha  whom by the bye with all his follies I love more and would actually have gone further to have paid a visit to than the greatest hero of antiquity  But this is not the moral of my story The thing I had in view was to shew the temper of the world in the whole of this affairFor you must know that so long as this explanation would have done the parson creditthe devil a soul could find it outI suppose his enemies would not and that his friends could notBut no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of the midwife and pay the expences of  the ordinary's licence to set her upbut the whole secret came out every horse he had lost and two horses more than ever he had lost with all the circumstances of their destruction were known and distinctly rememberedThe story ran like wildfire"The parson had a returning fit of pride which had just seized him and he was going to be well mounted once again in his life and if it was so 'twas plain as the sun at noonday he would pocket the expence of the licence ten times told the very first yearso that every body was left to judge what were his views in this act of charity"  What were his views in this and in every other action of his lifeor rather what were the opinions which floated in the brains of other people concerning it  was a thought which too much floated in his own and too often broke in upon his rest when he should have been sound asleep  About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made entirely easy upon that scoreit being just so long since he left his parishand the whole world at the same time behind himand stands accountable to a judge of whom he will have no cause to complain  But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men Order them as they will they pass thro' a certain medium which so twists and refracts them from their true directionsthat with all the titles to praise which a rectitude of heart can give the doers of them are  nevertheless forced to live and die without it  Of the truth of which this gentleman was a painful exampleBut to know by what means this came to passand to make that knowledge of use to you I insist upon it that you read the two following chapters which contain such a sketch of his life and conversation as will carry its moral along with itWhen this is done if nothing stops us in our way we will go on with the midwife  CHAP XI  YORICK was this parson's name and what is very remarkable in it as appears from a most antient account of the family wrote upon strong vellum  and now in perfect preservation it had been exactly so spelt for nearI was within an ace of saying nine hundred yearsbut I would not shake my credit in telling an improbable truth however indisputable in itselfand therefore I shall content myself with only sayingIt had been exactly so spelt without the least variation or transposition of a single letter for I do not know how long which is more than I would venture to say of one half of the best surnames in the kingdom which in a course of years have generally undergone as many chops and changes as their ownersHas this been owing to the pride or to the shame of the respective proprietorsIn honest truth I think sometimes to the one and sometimes to the other just as the temptation has wrought But a villainous affair it is and will one  day so blend and confound us all together that no one shall be able to stand up and swear "That his own great grand father was the man who did either this or that"  This evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent care of the  Yorick  's family and their religious preservation of these records I quote which do further inform us That the family was originally of  Danish  extraction and had been transplanted into  England  as early as in the reign of  Horwendillus  king of  Denmark  in whose court it seems an ancestor of this Mr  Yorick  's and from whom he was lineally descended held a considerable post to the day of his death Of what nature this considerable post was this record saith notit only adds That for near two centuries it had been totally  abolished as altogether unnecessary not only in that court but in every other court of the Christian world  It has often come into my head that this post could be no other than that of the king's chief Jesterand that  Hamlet  's  Yorick  in our  Shakespear  many of whose plays you know are founded upon authenticated factswas certainly the very man  I have not the time to look into  SaxoGrammaticus  's  Danish  history to know the certainty of thisbut if you have leisure and can easily get at the book you may do it full as well yourself  I had just time in my travels through  Denmark  with Mr  Noddy  's eldest son whom in the year I accompanied  as governor riding along with him at a prodigious rate thro' most parts of  Europe  and of which original journey perform'd by us two a most delectable narrative will be given in the progress of this work I had just time I say and that was all to prove the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner in that countrynamely "That nature was neither very lavish nor was she very stingy in her gifts of genius and capacity to its inhabitantsbut like a discreet parent was moderately kind to them all observing such an equal tenor in the distribution of her favours as to bring them in those points pretty near to a level with each other so that you will meet with few instances in that kingdom of refin'd parts but a great deal of good plain houshold understanding amongst all ranks of  people of which every body has a share" which is I think very right  With us you see the case is quite differentwe are all ups and downs in this matteryou are a great geniusor 'tis fifty to one Sir you are a great dunce and a blockheadnot that there is a total want of intermediate stepsnowe are not so irregular as that comes tobut the two extremes are more common and in a greater degree in this unsettled island where nature in her gifts and dispositions of this kind is most whimsical and capricious fortune herself not being more so in the bequest of her goods and chattels than she  This is all that ever stagger'd my faith in regard to  Yorick  's extraction who by what I can remember of him and by all  the accounts I could ever get of him seem'd not to have had one single drop of  Danish  blood in his whole crasis in nine hundred years it might possibly have all run outI will not philosophize one moment with you about it for happen how it would the fact was thisThat instead of that cold phlegm and exact regularity of sense and humours you would have look'd for in one so extractedhe was on the contrary as mercurial and sublimated a compositionas heteroclite a creature in all his declensionswith as much life and whim and  gait√© de coeur  about him as the kindliest climate could have engendered and put together With all this sail poor  Yorick  carried not one ounce of ballast he was utterly unpractised in the world and at the age of twentysix knew just about as well how to steer his course  in it as a romping unsuspicious girl of thirteen So that upon his first setting out the brisk gale of his spirits as you will imagine ran him foul ten times in a day of some body's tackling and as the grave and more slowpaced were oftenest in his wayyou may likewise imagine 'twas with such he had generally the ill luck to get the most entangled For aught I know there might be some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of such  Fracas  For to speak the truth  Yorick  had an invincible dislike and opposition in his nature to gravitynot to gravity as suchfor where gravity was wanted he would be the most grave or serious of mortal men for days and weeks togetherbut he was an enemy to the affectation of it and declared open war against it only as it appeared a cloak for ignorance or for  folly and then whenever it fell in his way however sheltered and protected he seldom gave it much quarter  Sometimes in his wild way of talking he would say That gravity was an errant scoundrel and he would addof the most dangerous kind toobecause a fly one and that he verily believed more honest wellmeaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in one twelvemonth than by pocketpicking and shoplifting in seven In the naked temper which a merry heart discovered he would say There was no dangerbut to itselfwhereas the very essence of gravity was design and consequently deceit'twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth and that with all its pretensionsit was  no better but often worse than what a  French  wit had long ago defined it  viz A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the mind  which definition of gravity  Yorick  with great imprudence would say deserved to be wrote in letters of gold  But in plain truth he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in the world and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every other subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress restraint  Yorick  had no impression but one and that was what arose from the nature of the deed spoken of which impression he would usually translate into plain  English  without any periphrasisand too oft without much distinction of either personage time or placeso that when mention was made of a pitiful or an  ungenerous proceedinghe never gave himself a moment's time to reflect who was the Hero of the piecewhat his stationor how far he had power to hurt him hereafterbut if it was a dirty actionwithout more adoThe man was a dirty fellowand so onAnd as his comments had usually the ill fate to be terminated either in a  bon mot  or to be enliven'd throughout with some drollery or humour of expression it gave wings to  Yorick  's indiscretion In a word tho' he never sought yet at the same time as he seldom shun'd occasions of saying what came uppermost and without much ceremonyhe had but too many temptations in life of scattering his wit and his humourhis gibes and his jests about himThey were not lost for want of gathering  What were the consequences and what was  Yorick  's catastrophe thereupon you will read in the next chapter  CHAP XII  THE  Mortgager  and  Mortgag√©e  differ the one from the other not more in length of purse than the  Jester  and  Jest√©e  do in that of memory But in this the comparison between them runs as the scholiasts call it upon allfour which by the bye is upon one or two legs more than some of the best of  Homer  's can pretend tonamely That the one raises a sum and the other a laugh at your expence and think no more about it Interest however still runs on in both casesthe periodical or accidental payments of it just serving  to keep the memory of the affair alive till at length in some evil hourpop comes the creditor upon each and by demanding principal upon the spot together with full interest to the very day makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations  As the reader for I hate your  ifs  has a thorough knowledge of human nature I need not say more to satisfy him that my Hero could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos To speak the truth he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small bookdebts of this stamp which notwithstanding  Eugenius  's frequent advice he too much disregarded thinking that as not one of them was contracted thro' any malignancybut on the contrary from an  honesty of mind and a mere jocundity of humour they would all of them be cross'd out in course  Eugenius  would never admit this and would often tell him that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with and he would often add in an accent of sorrowful apprehensionto the uttermost mite To which  Yorick  with his usual carelessness of heart would as often answer with a pshawand if the subject was started in the fieldswith a hop skip and a jump at the end of it but if close pent up in the social chimney corner where the culprit was barricado'd in with a table and a couple of arm chairs and could not so readily fly off in a tangent  Eugenius  would then go on with his lecture upon discretion in  words to this purpose though somewhat better put together  Trust me dear  Yorick  this unwary pleasantry of thine will sooner or later bring thee into scrapes and difficulties which no afterwit can extricate thee out ofIn these sallies too oft I see it happens that a person laugh'd at considers himself in the light of a person injured with all the rights of such a situation belonging to him and when thou viewest him in that light too and reckons up his friends his family his kindred and alliesand musters up with them the many recruits which will list under him from a sense of common danger'tis no extravagant arithmetic to say that for every ten jokesthou hast got a hundred enemies and till thou hast gone on and raised a swarm of wasps  about thy ears and art half stung to death by them thou wilt never be convinced it is so  I cannot suspect it in the man whom I esteem that there is the least spur from spleen or malevolence of intent in these salliesI believe and know them to be truly honest and sportiveBut consider my dear lad that fools cannot distinguish thisand that knaves will not and thou knowest not what it is either to provoke the one or to make merry with the otherwhenever they associate for mutual defence depend upon it they will carry on the war in such a manner against thee my dear friend as to make thee heartily sick of it and of thy life too  REVENGE from some baneful corner shall level a tale of dishonour at thee  which no innocence of heart or integrity of conduct shall set rightThe fortunes of thy house shall totterthy character which led the way to them shall bleed on every side of itthy faith questionedthy works beliedthy wit forgottenthy learning trampled on To wind up the last scene of thy tragedy CRUELTY and COWARDICE twin ruffians hired and set on by MALICE in the dark shall strike together at all thy infirmities and mistakesthe best of us my dear lad lye open thereand trust metrust me  Yorick    When to gratify a private appetite    it is once resolved upon    that an innocent and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed    'tis an easy matter to pick up sticks enew from any thicket where it has strayed    to make a fire to offer it up with  Yorick  scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny read over to him but with a tear stealing from his eye and a promissory look attending it that he was resolved for the time to come to ride his tit with more sobrietyBut alas too latea grand confederacy with ***** and ***** at the head of it was form'd before the first prediction of itThe whole plan of the attack just as  Eugenius  had foreboded was put in execution all at oncewith so little mercy on the side of the alliesand so little suspicion in  Yorick  of what was carrying on against himthat when he thought good easy man full surely preferment was o'ripeningthey had smote his root and then he fell as many a worthy man had fallen before him  Yorick  however fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for some time till overpower'd by numbers and worn out at length by the calamities of the warbut more so by the ungenerous manner in which it was carried onhe threw down the sword and though he kept up his spirits in appearance to the lasthe died nevertheless as was generally thought quite broken hearted  What inclined  Eugenius  to the same opinion was as follows  A few hours before  Yorick  breath'd his last  Eugenius  stept in with an intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him Upon his drawing  Yorick  's curtain and asking how he felt himself  Yorick  looking up in his face took hold of his handand after thanking him  for the many tokens of his friendship to him for which he said if it was their fate to meet hereafterhe would thank him again and againHe told him he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for everI hope not answered  Eugenius  with tears trickling down his cheeks and with the tenderest tone that ever man spokeI hope not  Yorick  said he  Yorick  replied with a look up and a gentle squeeze of  Eugenius  's hand and that was allbut it cut  Eugenius  to his heartComecome  Yorick  quoth  Eugenius  wiping his eyes and summoning up the man within himmy dear lad be comfortedlet not all thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou most wants themwho knows what resources are in store and what the power of God may yet do for thee  Yorick  laid his hand upon his heart and gently shook his headfor my part continued  Eugenius  crying bitterly as he uttered the wordsI declare I know not  Yorick  how to part with theeand would gladly flatter my hopes added  Eugenius  chearing up his voice that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishopand that I may live to see itI beseech thee  Eugenius  quoth  Yorick  taking off his nightcap as well as he could with his left handhis right being still grasped close in that of  Eugenius  I beseech thee to take a view of my headI see nothing that ails it replied  Eugenius  Then alas my friend said  Yorick  let me tell you that 'tis so bruised and misshapen'd with the blows which ***** and ***** and some others have so unhandsomely given me in the dark that I might say  with  Sancho Pan√ßa  that should I recover and "Mitres thereupon be suffer'd to rain down from heaven as thick as hail not one of 'em would fit it"  Yorick  's last breath was hanging upon his trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered thisyet still it was utter'd with something of a  cervantick  toneand as he spoke it  Eugenius  could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up for a moment in his eyesfaint picture of those flashes of his spirit which as  Shakespear  said of his ancestor were wont to set the table in a roar  Eugenius  was convinced from this that the heart of his friend was broke he squeez'd his handand then walk'd softly out of the room weeping as he walk'd  Yorick  followed  Eugenius  with his eyes to the doorhe then  closed themand never opened them more  He lies buried in a corner of his churchyard in the parish of  under a plain marble slabb which his friend  Eugenius  by leave of his executors laid upon his grave with no more than these three words of inscription serving both for his epitaph and elegy  Alas poor YORICK  Ten times in a day has  Yorick  's ghost the consolation to hear his monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones as denote a general  pity and esteem for hima foot way crossing the churchyard close by the side of his gravenot a passenger goes by without stopping to cast a look upon itand sighing as he walks on  Alas poor YORICK  entirely black page  entirely black page  CHAP XIII  IT is so long since the reader of this rhapsodical work has been parted from the midwife that it is high time to mention her again to him merely to put him in mind that there is such a body still in the world and whom upon the best judgment I can form upon my own plan at presentI am going to introduce to him for good and all But as fresh matter may be started and much unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader and myself which may require immediate dispatch'twas right to take care that the poor woman should not be lost in the mean timebecause when she is wanted we can no way do without her  I think I told you that this good woman was a person of no small note and consequence throughout our whole village and townshipthat her fame had spread itself to the very outedge and circumference of that circle of importance of which kind every soul living whether he has a shirt to his back or nohas one surrounding himwhich said circle by the way whenever 'tis said that such a one is of great weight and importance in the  world  I desire may be enlarged or contracted in your worship's fancy in a compoundratio of the station profession knowledge abilities height and depth measuring both ways of the personage brought before you  In the present case if I remember I fixed it at about four or five miles which not only comprehended the whole parish  but extended itself to two or three of the adjacent hamlets in the skirts of the next parish which made a considerable thing of it I must add That she was moreover very well looked on at one large grangehouse and some other odd houses and farms within two or three miles as I said from the smoke of her own chimneyBut I must here once for all inform you that all this will be more exactly delineated and explain'd in a map now in the hands of the engraver which with many other pieces and developments to this work will be added to the end of the twentieth volumenot to swell the workI detest the thought of such a thingbut by way of commentary scholium illustration and key to such passages incidents or inuendos as shall be thought to be either of private interpretation or of dark  or doubtful meaning after my life and my opinions shall have been read over now don't forget the meaning of the word by all the  world  which betwixt you and me and in spight of all the gentlemen reviewers in  GreatBritain  and of all that their worships shall undertake to write or say to the contraryI am determined shall be the caseI need not tell your worship that all this is spoke in confidence  CHAP XIV  UPON looking into my mother's marriage settlement in order to satisfy myself and reader in a point necessary to be clear'd up before we could proceed any further in this historyI had the good fortune to pop upon the  very thing I wanted before I had read a day and a half straight forwardsit might have taken me up a monthwhich shews plainly that when a man sits down to write a historytho' it be but the history of  Jack Hickathrift  or  Tom Thumb  he knows no more than his heels what lets and confounded hinderances he is to meet with in his wayor what a dance he may be led by one excursion or another before all is over Could a historiographer drive on his history as a muleteer drives on his mulestraight forwardfor instance from  Rome  all the way to  Loretto  without ever once turning his head aside either to the right hand or to the lefthe might venture to foretell you to an hour when he should get to his journey's endbut the thing is morally speaking impossible For if he is a man of the least spirit he  will have fifty deviations from a straight line to make with this or that party as he goes along which he can no ways avoid He will have views and prospects to himself perpetually solliciting his eye which he can no more help standing still to look at than he can fly he will moreover have various  Accounts to reconcile  Anecdotes to pick up  Inscriptions to make out  Stories to weave in  Traditions to sift  Personages to call upon  Panegyricks to paste up at this door  Pasquinades at that  All which both the man and his mule are quite exempt from To sum up all there are archives at every stage to be look'd into and rolls records documents and endless genealogies which justice ever  and anon calls him back to stay the reading ofIn short there is no end of itfor my own part I declare I have been at it these six weeks making all the speed I possibly couldand am not yet bornI have just been able and that's all to tell you  when  it happen'd but not  how  so that you see the thing is yet far from being accomplished  These unforeseen stoppages which I own I had no conception of when I first set outbut which I am convinced now will rather increase than diminish as I advancehave struck out a hint which I am resolved to followand that isnot to be in a hurrybut to go on leisurely writing and publishing two volumes of my life every yearwhich if I am suffered to go on quietly and can make a tolerable bargain with my bookseller  I shall continue to do as long as I live  CHAP XV  THE article in my mother's marriage settlement which I told the reader I was at the pains to search for and which now that I have found it I think proper to lay before himis so much more fully express'd in the deed itself than ever I can pretend to do it that it would be barbarity to take it out of the lawyer's handIt is as follows  "  And this Indenture further witnesseth  That the said  Walter Shandy  merchant in

words"My mother was to lay in if she chose it in  London  "  But in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on the part of my mother which a marriage article of this  nature too manifestly opened a door to and which indeed had never been thought of at all but for my uncle  Toby Shandy  a clause was added in security of my father which was this"That in case my mother hereafter should at any time put my father to the trouble and expence of a  London  journey upon false cries and tokensthat for every such instance she should forfeit all the right and title which the covenant gave her to the next turnbut to no moreand so on  toties quoties  in as effectual a manner as if such a covenant betwixt them had not been made"This by the way was no more than what was reasonableand yet as reasonable as it was I have ever thought it hard that the whole weight of the article should have fallen entirely as it did upon myself  But I was begot and born to misfortunesfor my poor mother whether it was wind or wateror a compound of bothor neitheror whether it was simply the mere swell of imagination and fancy in heror how far a strong wish and desire to have it so might mislead her judgmentin short whether she was deceived or deceiving in this matter it no way becomes me to decide The fact was this That in the latter end of  September  which was the year before I was born my mother having carried my father up to town much against the grainhe peremptorily insisted upon the clauseso that I was doom'd by marriage articles to have my nose squeez'd as flat to my face as if the destinies had actually spun me without one  How this event came aboutand what a train of vexatious disappointments in one stage or other of my life have pursued me from the mere loss or rather compression of this one single membershall be laid before the reader all in due time  CHAP XVI  MY father as any body may naturally imagine came down with my mother into the country in but a pettish kind of a humour The first twenty or fiveandtwenty miles he did nothing in the world but fret and teaze himself and indeed my mother too about the cursed expence which he said might every shilling of it have been savedthen what vexed him more than every  thing else was the provoking time of the yearwhich as I told you was towards the end of  September  when his wallfruit and green gages especially in which he was very curious were just ready for pulling"Had he been whistled up to  London  upon a  Tom Fool  's errand in any other month of the whole year he should not have said three words about it"  For the next two whole stages no subject would go down but the heavy blow he had sustain'd from the loss of a son whom it seems he had fully reckon'd upon in his mind and register'd down in his pocketbook as a second staff for his old age in case  Bobby  should fail him "The disappointment of this he said was ten times more to a wise man than all the money which the journey  c  had cost him put togetherrot the hundred and twenty poundshe did not mind it a rush"  From  Stilton  all the way to  Grantham  nothing in the whole affair provoked him so much as the condolences of his friends and the foolish figure they should both make at church the first  Sunday  of which in the satirical vehemence of his wit now sharpen'd a little by vexation he would give so many humorous and provoking descriptionsand place his rib and self in so many tormenting lights and attitudes in the face of the whole congregationthat my mother declared these two stages were so truly tragicomical that she did nothing but laugh and cry in a breath from one end to the other of them all the way  From  Grantham  till they had cross'd the  Trent  my father was out of all kind of patience at the vile trick and imposition which he fancied my mother had put upon him in this affair"Certainly he would say to himself over and over again "the woman could not be deceived herselfif she couldwhat weaknesstormenting word which led his imagination a thorny dance and before all was over play'd the duce and all with him"for sure as ever the word  weakness  was uttered and struck full upon his brainso sure it set him upon running divisions upon how many kinds of weaknesses there werethat there was such a thing as weakness of the bodyas well as weakness of the mindand then he would do nothing but syllogize within himself for a stage or two  together How far the cause of all these vexations might or might not have arisen out of himself  In short he had so many little subjects of disquietude springing out of this one affair all fretting successively in his mind as they rose up in it that my mother whatever was her journey up had but an uneasy journey of it downIn a word as she complained to my uncle  Toby  he would have tired out the patience of any flesh alive  CHAP XVII  THough my father travelled homewards as I told you in none of the best of moodspshawing and pishing all the way downyet he had the  complaisance to keep the worst part of the story still to himselfwhich was the resolution he had taken of doing himself the justice which my uncle  Toby  's clause in the marriage settlement empowered him nor was it till the very night in which I was begot which was thirteen months after that she had the least intimation of his designwhen my father happening as you remember to be a little chagrin'd and out of tempertook occasion as they lay chatting gravely in bed afterwards talking over what was to cometo let her know that she must accommodate herself as well as she could to the bargain made between them in their marriage deeds which was to lyein of her next child in the country to balance the last year's journey  My father was a gentleman of many virtuesbut he had a strong spice of that in his temper which might or might not add to the number'Tis known by the name of perseverance in a good causeand of obstinacy in a bad one Of this my mother had so much knowledge that she knew 'twas to no purpose to make any remonstranceso she e'en resolved to sit down quietly and make the most of it  CHAP XVIII  AS the point was that night agreed or rather determin'd that my mother should lyein of me in the country she took her measures accordingly for which purpose when she was three days or thereabouts gone with child she began  to cast her eyes upon the midwife whom you have so often heard me mention and before the week was well got round as the famous Dr  Maningham  was not to be had she had come to a final determination in her mindnotwithstanding there was a scientifick operator within so near a call as eight miles of us and who moreover had expressly wrote a five shillings book upon the subject of midwifery in which he had exposed not only the blunders of the sisterhood itselfbut had likewise superadded many curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the foetus in cross births and some other cases of danger which belay us in getting into the world notwithstanding all this my mother I say was absolutely determined to trust her life and mine with it into no soul's hand but this old woman's onlyNow this I  likewhen we cannot get at the very thing we wishnever to take up with the next best in degree to itno that's pitiful beyond descriptionit is no more than a week from this very day in which I am now writing this book for the edification of the worldwhich is  March  that my dear dear  Jenny  observing I look'd a little grave as she stood cheapening a silk of fiveandtwenty shillings a yardtold the mercer she was sorry she had given him so much troubleand immediately went and bought herself a yardwide stuff of tenpence a yard'Tis the duplication of one and the same greatness of soul only what lessen'd the honour of it somewhat in my mother's case was that she could not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extream as one in her situation might have wish'd because the  old midwife had really some little claim to be depended uponas much at least as success could give her having in the course of her practice of near twenty years in the parish brought every mother's son of them into the world without any one slip or accident which could fairly be laid to her account  These facts tho' they had their weight yet did not altogether satisfy some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung upon my father's spirits in relation to this choiceTo say nothing of the natural workings of humanity and justiceor of the yearnings of parental and connubial love all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in a case of this kindhe felt himself concern'd in a particular manner that all should go right in the present casefrom the  accumulated sorrow he lay open to should any evil betide his wife and child in lyingin at  ShandyHall  He knew the world judged by events and would add to his afflictions in such a misfortune by loading him with the whole blame of it"Alas o'dayhad Mrs  Shandy  poor gentlewoman had but her wish in going up to town just to lyein and come down againwhich they say she begg'd and pray'd for upon her bare kneesand which in my opinion considering the fortune which Mr  Shandy  got with herwas no such mighty matter to have complied with the lady and her babe might both of 'em have been alive at this hour"  This exclamation my father knew was unanswerableand yet it was not merely to shelter himselfnor was  it altogether for the care of his offspring and wife that he seem'd so extremely anxious about this pointmy father had extensive views of thingsand stood moreover as he thought deeply concern'd in it for the publick good from the dread he entertained of the bad uses an illfated instance might be put to  He was very sensible that all political writers upon the subject had unanimously agreed and lamented from the beginning of Queen  Elizabeth  's reign down to his own time that the current of men and money towards the metropolis upon one frivolous errand or anotherset in so strongas to become dangerous to our civil rightstho' by the byea  current  was not the image he took most delight ina  distemper  was  here his favourite metaphor and he would run it down into a perfect allegory by maintaining it was identically the same in the body national as in the body natural where blood and spirits were driven up into the head faster than they could find their ways downa stoppage of circulation must ensue which was death in both cases  There was little danger he would say of losing our liberties by  French  politicks or  French  invasionsnor was he so much in pain of a consumption from the mass of corrupted matter and ulcerated humours in our constitutionwhich he hoped was not so bad as it was imaginedbut he verily feared that in some violent push we should go off all at once in a stateapoplexyand  then he would say  The Lord have mercy upon us all  My father was never able to give the history of this distemperwithout the remedy along with it  "Was I an absolute prince he would say pulling up his breeches with both his hands as he rose from his armchair "I would appoint able judges at every avenue of my metropolis who should take cognizance of every fool's business who came thereand if upon a fair and candid hearing it appeared not of weight sufficient to leave his own home and come up bag and baggage with his wife and children farmers sons  c c  at his backside they should be all sent back from constable to constable like vagrants  as they were to the place of their legal settlements By this means I shall take care that my metropolis totter'd not thro' its own weightthat the head be no longer too big for the bodythat the extreams now wasted and pin'd in be restored to their due share of nourishment and regain with it their natural strength and beautyI would effectually provide That the meadows and cornfields of my dominions should laugh and singthat good chear and hospitality flourish once moreand that such weight and influence be put thereby into the hands of the Squirality of my kingdom as should counterpoise what I perceive my Nobility are now taking from them  "Why are there so few palaces and gentlemen's seats he would ask with some emotion as he walked across the room "throughout so many delicious provinces in  France  Whence is it that the few remaining  Chateaus  amongst them are so dismantledso unfurnished and in so ruinous and desolate a condition Because Sir he would say "in that kingdom no man has any countryinterest to supportthe little interest of any kind which any man has any where in it is concentrated in the court and the looks of the Grand Monarch by the sunshine of whose countenance or the clouds which pass across it every  French  man lives or dies"  Another political reason which prompted my father so strongly to guard against  the least evil accident in my mother's lyingin in the countrywas That any such instance would infallibly throw a balance of power too great already into the weaker vessels of the gentry in his own or higher stationswhich with the many other usurped rights which that part of the constitution was hourly establishingwould in the end prove fatal to the monarchical system of domestick government established in the first creation of things by God  In this point he was entirely of Sir  Robert Filmer  's opinion That the plans and institutions of the greatest monarchies in the eastern parts of the world were originally all stolen from that admirable pattern and prototype of this houshold and paternal powerwhich for a century he said and more had  gradually been degenerating away into a mix'd governmentthe form of which however desirable in great combinations of the specieswas very troublesome in small onesand seldom produced any thing that he saw but sorrow and confusion  For all these reasons private and publick put togethermy father was for having the manmidwife by all meansmy mother by no means My father begg'd and intreated she would for once recede from her prerogative in this matter and suffer him to choose for hermy mother on the contrary insisted upon her privilege in this matter to choose for herselfand have no mortal's help but the old woman'sWhat could my father do He was almost at his wit's endtalked it over with her in all  moodsplaced his arguments in all lightsargued the matter with her like a christianlike a heathenlike a husbandlike a fatherlike a patriotlike a manMy mother answered every thing only like a woman which was a little hard upon herfor as she could not assume and fight it out behind such a variety of characters'twas no fair match'twas seven to oneWhat could my mother doShe had the advantage otherwise she had been certainly overpowered of a small reinforcement of chagrine personal at the bottom which bore her up and enabled her to dispute the affair with my father with so equal an advantagethat both sides sung  Te Deum  In a word my mother was to have the old womanand the operator was to have licence to drink a bottle of wine with  my father and my uncle  Toby Shandy  in the back parlourfor which he was to be paid five guineas  I must beg leave before I finish this chapter to enter a caveat in the breast of my fair readerand it is thisNot to take it absolutely for granted from an unguarded word or two which I have dropp'd in it"That I am a married man"I own the tender appellation of my dear dear  Jenny  with some other strokes of conjugal knowledge interspersed here and there might naturally enough have misled the most candid judge in the world into such a determination against meAll I plead for in this case Madam is strict justice and that you do so much of it to me as well as to yourselfas not to prejudge or receive such an impression of me till  you have better evidence than I am positive at present can be produced against meNot that I can be so vain or unreasonable Madam as to desire you should therefore think that my dear dear  Jenny  is my kept mistressnothat would be flattering my character in the other extream and giving it an air of freedom which perhaps it has no kind of right to All I contend for is the utter impossibility for some volumes that you or the most penetrating spirit upon earth should know how this matter really standsIt is not impossible but that my dear dear  Jenny  tender as the appellation is may be my childConsiderI was born in the year eighteenNor is there any thing unnatural or extravagant in the supposition that my dear  Jenny  may be my friendFriendMy friendSurely Madam  a friendship between the two sexes may subsist and be supported without  Fy Mr  Shandy  Without any thing Madam but that tender and delicious sentiment which ever mixes in friendship where there is a difference of sex Let me intreat you to study the pure and sentimental parts of the best  French  Romancesit will really Madam astonish you to see with what a variety of chaste expression this delicious sentiment which I have the honour to speak of is dress'd out  CHAP XIX  I Would sooner undertake to explain the hardest problem in Geometry than pretend to account for it that a gentleman of my father's great good  senseknowing as the reader must have observed him and curious too in philosophywise also in political reasoningand in polemical as he will find no way ignorantcould be capable of entertaining a notion in his head so out of the common trackthat I fear the reader when I come to mention it to him if he is the least of a cholerick temper will immediately throw the book by if mercurial he will laugh most heartily at itand if he is of a grave and saturnine cast he will at first sight absolutely condemn as fanciful and extravagant and that was in respect to the choice and imposition of Christian names on which he thought a great deal more depended than what superficial minds were capable of conceiving  His opinion in this matter was That there was a strange kind of magick bias which good or bad names as he called them irresistibly impress'd upon our characters and conduct  The Hero of  Cervantes  argued not the point with more seriousnessnor had he more faithor more to say on the powers of Necromancy in dishonouring his deedsor on DULCINEA'S name in shedding lustre upon them than my father had on those of TRISMEGISTUS or ARCHIMEDES on the one handor of NYKY and SIMKIN on the other How many CAESARS and POMPEYS he would say by mere inspiration of the names have been render'd worthy of them And how many he would add are there who might have done exceeding well in the world had not their characters and  spirits been totally depress'd and NICODEMUS'D into nothing  I see plainly Sir by your looks or as the case happen'd my father would saythat you do not heartily subscribe to this opinion of minewhich to those he would add who have not carefully sifted it to the bottomI own has an air more of fancy than of solid reasoning in itand yet my dear Sir if I may presume to know your character I am morally assured I should hazard little in stating a case to younot as a party in the disputebut as a judge and trusting my appeal upon it to your own good sense and candid disquisition in this matteryou are a person free from as many narrow prejudices of education as most menand if I may presume to penetrate further into youof a liberality  of genius above bearing down an opinion merely because it wants friends Your sonyour dear sonfrom whose sweet and open temper you have so much to expectYour BILLY Sirwould you for the world have called him JUDASWould you my dear Sir he would say laying his hand upon your breast with the genteelest addressand in that soft and irresistible  piano  of voice which the nature of the  argumentum ad hominem  absolutely requiresWould you Sir if a  Jew  of a godfather had proposed the name for your child and offered you his purse along with it would you have confented to such a desecration of himO my God he would say looking up if I know your temper right Siryou are incapable of ityou would have trampled upon the offer  you would have thrown the temptation at the tempter's head with abhorrence  Your greatness of mind in this action which I admire with that generous contempt of money which you shew me in the whole transaction is really nobleand what renders it more so is the principle of itthe workings of a parent's love upon the truth and conviction of this very hypothesis namely That was your son called JUDASthe fordid and treacherous idea so inseparable from the name would have accompanied him thro' life like his shadow and in the end made a miser and a rascal of him in spight Sir of your example  I never knew a man able to answer this argumentBut indeed to speak of my father as he washe was certainly  irresistible both in his orations and disputationshe was born an orator  Persuasion hung upon his lips and the elements of Logick and Rhetorick were so blended up in himand withall he had so shrewd guess at the weaknesses and passions of his respondentthat NATURE might have stood up and said"This man is eloquent" In short whether he was on the weak or the strong side of the question 'twas hazardous in either case to attack himAnd yet 'tis strange he had never read  Cicero  nor  Quintilian de Oratore  nor  Isocrates  nor  Aristotle  nor  Longinus  amongst the antientsnor  Vossius  nor  Skioppius  nor  Ramus  nor  Farnaby  amongst the modernsand what is more astonishing he had never in his whole life the least light or spark of subtilty struck into his mind by one single  lecture upon  Crackenthorp  or  Burgersdicius  or any  Dutch  logician or commentatorhe knew not so much as in what the difference of an argument  ad ignorantiam  and an argument  ad hominem  consisted so that I well remember when he went up along with me to enter my name at  Jesus College  in ****it was a matter of just wonder with my worthy tutor and two or three fellows of that learned societythat a man who knew not so much as the names of his tools should be able to work after that fashion with 'em  To work with them in the best manner he could was what my father was however perpetually forced uponfor he had a thousand little sceptical notions of the comick kind to defendmost of which notions I verily believe  at first enter'd upon the footing of mere whims and of a  vive la Bagatelle  and as such he would make merry with them for half an hour or so and having sharpen'd his wit upon 'em dismiss them till another day  I mention this not only as matter of hypothesis or conjecture upon the progress and establishment of my father's many odd opinionsbut as a warning to the learned reader against the indiscreet reception of such guests who after a free and undisturbed enterance for some years into our brainsat length claim a kind of settlement thereworking sometimes like yeastbut more generally after the manner of the gentle passion beginning in jestbut ending in downright earnest  Whether this was the case of the singularity of my father's notionsor that his judgment at length became the dupe of his witor how far in many of his notions he might tho' odd be absolutely rightthe reader as he comes at them shall decide All that I maintain here is that in this one of the influence of Christian names however it gain'd footing he was serioushe was all uniformityhe was systematical and like all systematick reasoners he would move both heaven and earth and twist and torture every thing in nature to support his hypothesis In a word I repeat it over againhe was seriousand in consequence of it he would lose all kind of patience whenever he saw people especially of condition who should have known betteras careless and as indifferent about the name  they imposed upon their childor more so than in the choice of  Ponto  or  Cupid  for their puppy dog  This he would say look'd illand had moreover this particular aggravation in it  viz  That when once a vile name was wrongfully or injudiciously given 'twas not like the case of a man's character which when wrong'd might hereafter be clear'dand possibly sometime or other if not in the man's life at least after his deathbe somehow or other set to rights with the world But the injury of this he would say could never be undonenay he doubted even whether an act of parliament could reach itHe knew as well as you that the legislature assum'd a power over surnamesbut for very strong reasons which he could give it had never  yet adventured he would say to go a step further  It was observable that tho' my father in consequence of this opinion had as I have told you the strongest likings and dislikings towards certain namesthat there were still numbers of names which hung so equally in the balance before him that they were absolutely indifferent to him  Jack    Dick  and  Tom  were of this class These my father call'd neutral namesaffirming of them without a satyr That there had been as many knaves and fools at least as wise and good men since the world began who had indifferently borne themso that like equal forces acting against each other in contrary directions he thought they mutually destroyed each others effects for which reason he would often declare  He would not give a cherrystone to choose amongst them  Bob  which was my brother's name was another of these neutral kinds of Christian names which operated very little either way and as my father happen'd to be at  Epsom  when it was given himhe would oft times thank heaven it was no worse  Andrew  was something like a negative quantity in Algebra with him'twas worse he said than nothing  William  stood pretty high  Numps  again was low with himand  Nick  he said was the DEVIL  But of all the names in the universe he had the most unconquerable aversion for TRISTRAMhe had the lowest and most contemptible opinion of it of any thing in the worldthinking it could possibly produce nothing in  rerum natur√¢  but what was extreamly mean and pitiful  So that in the midst of a dispute on the subject in which by the bye he was frequently involvedhe would sometimes break off in a sudden and spirited EPIPHONEMA or rather EROTESIS raised a third and sometimes a full fifth above the key of the discourseand demand it categorically of his antagonist Whether he would take upon him to say he had ever remember'dwhether he had ever reador even whether he had ever heard tell of a man call'd  Tristram  performing any thing great or worth recordingNo he would sayTRISTRAMThe thing is impossible  What could be wanting in my father but to have wrote a book to publish this notion of his to the world Little boots it to the subtle speculatist to stand single in his opinionsunless he gives them  proper ventIt was the identical thing which my father didfor in the year sixteen which was two years before I was born he was at the pains of writing an express DISSERTATION simply upon the word  Tristram  shewing the world with great candour and modesty the grounds of his great abhorrence to the name  When this story is compared with the titlepageWill not the gentle reader pity my father from his soulto see an orderly and welldisposed gentleman who tho' singularyet inoffensive in his notionsso played upon in them by cross purposesto look down upon the stage and see him baffled and overthrown in all his little systems and wishes to behold a train of events perpetually falling out against him and in so critical and cruel a way as if they had purposedly  been plann'd and pointed against him merely to insult his speculationsIn a word to behold such a one in his old age illfitted for troubles ten times in a day suffering sorrowten times in a day calling the child of his prayers TRISTRAMMelancholy dissyllable of sound which to his ears was unison to  Nicompoop  and every name vituperative under heavenBy his ashes I swear itif ever malignant spirit took pleasure or busied itself in traversing the purposes of mortal manit must have been hereand if it was not necessary I should be born before I was christened I would this moment give the reader an account of it  CHAP XX  How could you Madam be so inattentive in reading the last chapter I told you in it  That my mother was not a papist  Papist You told me no such thing Sir Madam I beg leave to repeat it over again That I told you as plain at least as words by direct inference could tell you such a thingThen Sir I must have miss'd a pageNo Madamyou have not miss'd a wordThen I was asleep SirMy pride Madam cannot allow you that refugeThen I declare I know nothing at all about the matterThat Madam is the very fault I lay to your charge and as a punishment for it I do insist upon it that you immediately turn back that is as soon as you get to the next full stop and read the whole chapter over again  I have imposed this penance upon the lady neither out of wantonness or cruelty but from the best of motives and therefore shall make her no apology for it when she returns back'Tis to rebuke a vicious taste which has crept into thousands besides herselfof reading straight forwards more in quest of the adventures than of the deep erudition and knowledge which a book of this cast if read over as it should be would infallibly impart with themThe mind should be accustomed to make wise reflections and draw curious conclusions as it goes along the habitude of which made  Pliny  the younger affirm "That he never read a book so bad but he drew some profit from it" The stories of  Greece  and  Rome  run over without this turn and applicationdo less service I affirm it than the history of  Parismus  and  Parismenus  or of the Seven Champions of  England  read with it  But here comes my fair Lady Have you read over again the chapter Madam as I desired youYou have And did you not observe the passage upon the second reading which admits the inferenceNot a word like it Then Madam be pleased to ponder well the last line but one of the chapter where I take upon me to say "It was  necessary  I should be born before I was christen'd" Had my mother Madam been a Papist that consequence did not follow  The  Romish  Rituals direct the baptizing of the child in cases of danger  before  it is bornbut upon this proviso That some part or other of the child's body be seen by the baptizerBut the Doctors of the  Sorbonne  by a deliberation held amongst them  April  have enlarged the powers of the midwives by determining That tho' no part of the child's body should appearthat baptism shall nevertheless be administered to it by injection  par le moyen d' une petite Canulle  Anglic√® a squirt'Tis very strange that St  Thomas Aquinas  who had so good a mechanical head both for tying and untying the knots of school divinityshould after so much pains bestowed upon thisgive up the point at last as a second  La chose impossible  "Infantes in maternis uteris existentes quoth St  Thomas  baptizari possunt  nullo modo  " O  Thomas Thomas  If the reader has the curiosity to see the question upon baptism  by injection  as presented to the Doctors of the  Sorbonne  with their consultation thereupon it is as follows    It is a terrible misfortune for this same book of mine but more so to the Republick of Lettersso that my own is quite swallowed up in the consideration of itthat this selfsame vile pruriency for fresh adventures in all things has got so strongly into our habit and humoursand so wholly intent are we upon satisfying the impatience of our concupiscence that waythat nothing  but the gross and more carnal parts of a composition will go downThe subtle hints and sly communications of science fly off like spirits upwardsthe heavy moral escapes downwards and both the one and the other are as much lost to the world as if they were still left in the bottom of the inkhorn  I wish the malereader has not pass'd by many a one as quaint and curious as this one in which the femalereader has been detected I wish it may have its effectsand that all good people both male and female from her example may be taught to think as well as read  MEMOIRE present√© √† Messieurs les Docteurs de SORBONNE  Vide Deventer Paris Edit to p    UN Chirurgien Accoucheur represente √† Messieurs les Docteurs de  Sorbonne  qu' il y a des cas quoique tr√©s rares o√∫ une mere ne s√ßauroit accoucher m√™me o√∫ l'enfant est tellement renferm√™ dans le sein de sa mere qu' il ne fait par√¥itre aucune partie de son corps ce qui seroit un cas suivant les Rituels de lui conf√©rer du moins sous condition le bapt√™me Le Chirurgien qui consulte pr√©tend par le moyen d'une  petite canulle  de pouvoir baptiser immediatement l'enfant sans faire aucun tort √† la mereIl demand si ce moyen qu' il vient de proposer est permis l√©gitime et s'il peut s'en servir dans le cas qu' il vient d' exposer  REPONSE  LE Conseil estime que la question propos√©e souffre de grandes difficultes Les Th√©ologiens posent d'un cot√© pour principe que le bapt√©me qui est une naissance spirituelle suppose une premiere naissance il faut √™tre n√© dans le monde pour ren√¢itre en  Jesus Christ  comme ils l'enseignent S  Thomas    part quaest    artic  suit cette doctrine comme une verit√© constante l'on ne peut dit ce S Docteur baptiser les enfans qui sont renferm√©s dans le sein de leurs Meres et S  Thomas  est fond√© sur ce que les enfans ne sont point n√©s ne peuvent √™tre compt√©s parmi les autres hommes d'ou il conclud qu'ils ne peuvent √™tre l'object d'une action ext√©rieure pour recevoir

   ut per eorum ministerium sacramenta recipiant ad salutem  Les rituels ordonnent dans la pratique ce que les th√©ologiens ont √©tabli sur les m√™mes mati√©res ils deffendent tous d'une mani√©re uniforme de baptiser les enfans qui sont renferm√©s dans le sein de leurs meres s'ils ne font paroitre quelque partie de leurs corps Le concours des th√©ologiens des rituels qui sont les r√©gles des dioc√©ses par√¥it former une autorit√© qui termine la question presente cependant le conseil de conscience considerant d'un cot√© que le raisonnement des th√©ologiens est uniquement fond√© sur une raison de convenance que la deffense des rituels suppose que l'on ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renferm√©s dans le sein de leurs meres ce qui est contre la supposition presente d'un autre c√¥t√© considerant que les m√™mes  th√©ologiens enseignent que l'on peut risquer les sacremens qu'  Jesus Christ  a √©tablis comme des moyens faciles mais n√©cessaires pour sanctifier les hommes d'ailleurs estimant que les enfans renferm√©s dans le sein de leurs meres pourroient √™tre capables de salut parce qu'ils sont capables de damnationpour ces considerations eu √©gard a l'expos√© suivant lequel on assure avoir trouv√© un moyen certain de baptiser ces enfans ainsi renferm√©s sans faire aucun tort √† la mere le Conseil estime que l'on pourroit se servir du moyen propos√© dans la confiance qu'il a que Dieu n' a point laiss√© ces sortes d'enfans sans aucuns secours supposant comme il est expos√© que le moyen dont il s'agit est propre √† leur procurer le bapt√™me cependant comme il s'agiroit en autorisant la pratique propos√©e de changer une r√©gle universellement √©tablie le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit s'addresser a son √©v√™que √† qui il appartient  de juger de l'utilit√© du danger du moyen propos√© comme sous le bon plaisir de l'ev√©que le conseil estime qu'il faudroit recourir au Pape qui a le droit d'expliquer les r√©gles de l'eglise et d' y d√©roger dans le cas ou la loi ne s√ßauroit obliger quelque sage quelque utile que paroisse la mani√©re de baptiser dont il s'agit le conseil ne pourroit l'approuver sans le concours de ces deux autorit√©s On conseile au moins √† celui qui consulte de s'addresser √† son ev√™que de lui faire part de la presente d√©cision afin que si le prelat entre dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussign√©s s'appuyent il puisse √™tre autoris√© dans le cas de n√©cessit√© ou il risqueroit trop d'attendre que la permission f√ªt demand√©e accord√©e d'employer le moyen qu' il propose si avantageux au salut de l'enfant Au reste le conseil en estimant que l'on pourroit s'en servir croit cependant que si les enfans dont il s'agit venoient au monde contre l'esperance  de ceux qui se s√©roient servis du m√™me moyen il s√©roit n√©cessaire de les baptiser  sous condition  en cela le conseil se conforme √† tous les rituels qui en autorisant le bapt√™me d'un enfant qui fait paro√Ætre quelque partie de son

le moyen d'une  petite canulle and  sans faire aucun tort au pere  CHAP XXI  I wonder what's all that noise and running backwards and forwards for above stairs quoth my father addressing himself after an hour and a half's silence to my uncle  Toby  who  you must know was sitting on the opposite side of the fire smoking his social pipe all the time in mute contemplation of a new pair of blackplushbreeches which he had got onWhat can they be doing brother quoth my fatherwe can scarce hear ourselves talk  I think replied my uncle  Toby  taking his pipe from his mouth and striking the head of it two or three times upon the nail of his left thumb as he began his sentenceI think says heBut to enter rightly into my uncle  Toby  's sentiments upon this matter you must be made to enter first a little into his character the outlines of which I shall just give you and then the dialogue between him and my father will go on as well again  Pray what was that man's namefor I write in such a hurry I have no time to recollect or look for itwho first made the observation "That there was great inconstancy in our air and climate" Whoever he was 'twas a just and good observation in himBut the corollary drawn from it namely "That it is this which has furnished us with such a variety of odd and whimsical characters"that was not hisit was found out by another man at least a century and a half after himThen againthat this copious storehouse of original materials is the true and natural cause that our Comedies are so much better than those of  France  or any others that either have or can be wrote upon the Continentthat discovery was not fully made till about the middle of king  William  's reignwhen the great  Dryden    in writing one of his long prefaces if I mistake not most fortunately hit upon it Indeed towards the latter end of queen  Anne  the great  Addison  began to patronize the notion and more fully explained it to the world in one or two of his Spectatorsbut the discovery was not hisThen fourthly and lastly that this strange irregularity in our climate producing so strange an irregularity in our charactersdoth thereby in some sort make us amends by giving us somewhat to make us merry with when the weather will not suffer us to go out of doorsthat observation is my ownand was struck out by me this very rainy day  March  and betwixt the hours of nine and ten in the morning  Thusthus my fellow labourers and associates in this great harvest of our  learning now ripening before our eyes thus it is by slow steps of casual increase that our knowledge physical metaphysical physiological polemical nautical mathematical aenigmatical technical biographical romantical chemical and obstetrical with fifty other branches of it most of 'em ending as these do in  ical  have for these two last centuries and more gradually been creeping upwards towards that  of their perfections from which if we may form a conjecture from the advances of these last seven years we cannot possibly be far off  When that happens it is to be hoped it will put an end to all kind of writings whatsoeverthe want of all kind of writing will put an end to all kind of readingand that in time  As war begets poverty    poverty peace  must in  course put an end to all kind of knowledgeand thenwe shall have all to begin over again or in other words be exactly where we started  Happy thrice happy Times I only wish that the aera of my begetting as well as the mode and manner of it had been a little alter'dor that it could have been put off with any convenience to my father or mother for some twenty or fiveandtwenty years longer when a man in the literary world might have stood some chance  But I forget my uncle  Toby  whom all this while we have left knocking the ashes out of his tobacco pipe  His humour was of that particular species which does honour to our atmosphere  and I should have made no scruple of ranking him amongst one of the firstrate productions of it had not there appear'd too many strong lines in it of a familylikeness which shewed that he derived the singularity of his temper more from blood than either wind or water or any modifications or combinations of them whatever And I have therefore oft times wondered that my father tho' I believe he had his reasons for it upon his observing some tokens of excentricity in my course when I was a boyshould never once endeavour to account for them in this way for all the SHANDY FAMILY were of an original character throughoutI mean the malesthe females had no character at allexcept indeed my great aunt DINAH who about sixty years ago was married and got with child by the coachman  for which my father according to his hypothesis of Christian names would often say She might thank her godfathers and godmothers  It will seem very strangeand I would as soon think of dropping a riddle in the reader's way which is not my interest to do as set him upon guessing how it could come to pass that an event of this kind so many years after it had happened should be reserved for the interruption of the peace and unity which otherwise so cordially subsisted between my father and my uncle  Toby  One would have thought that the whole force of the misfortune should have spent and wasted itself in the family at firstas is generally the caseBut nothing ever wrought with our family after the ordinary way Possibly at the  very time this happened it might have something else to afflict it and as afflictions are sent down for our good and that as this had never done the SHANDY FAMILY any good at all it might lye waiting till apt times and circumstances should give it an opportunity to discharge its officeObserve I determine nothing upon thisMy way is ever to point out to the curious different tracts of investigation to come at the first springs of the events I tellnot with a pedantic  Fescue  or in the decisive Manner of  Tacitus  who outwits himself and his readerbut with the officious humility of a heart devoted to the assistance merely of the inquisitiveto them I writeand by them I shall be readif any such reading as this could be supposed to hold out so long to the very end of the world  Why this cause of sorrow therefore was thus reserved for my father and uncle is undetermined by me But how and in what direction it exerted itself so as to become the cause of dissatisfaction between them after it began to operate is what I am able to explain with great exactness and is as follows  My uncle TOBY SHANDY Madam was a gentleman who with the virtues which usually constitute the character of a man of honour and rectitudepossessed one in a very eminent degree which is seldom or never put into the catalogue and that was a most extream and unparallel'd modesty of naturetho' I correct the word nature for this reason that I may not prejudge a point which must shortly come to a hearing and that is Whether this modesty of his was natural  or acquir'dWhich ever way my uncle  Toby  came by it 'twas nevertheless modesty in the truest sense of it and that is Madam not in regard to words for he was so unhappy as to have very little choice in thembut to thingsand this kind of modesty so possess'd him and it arose to such a height in him as almost to equal if such a thing could be even the modesty of a woman That female nicety Madam and inward cleanliness of mind and fancy in your sex which makes you so much the awe of ours  You will imagine Madam that my uncle  Toby  had contracted all this from this very sourcethat he had spent a great part of his time in converse with your sex and that from a thorough knowledge of you and the force of imitation  which such fair examples render irresistablehe had acquired this amiable turn of mind  I wish I could say sofor unless it was with his sisterinlaw my father's wife and my mothermy uncle  Toby  scarce exchanged three words with the sex in as many yearsno he got it Madam by a blowA blowYes Madam it was owing to a blow from a stone broke off by a ball from the parapet of a hornwork at the siege of  Namur  which struck full upon my uncle  Toby  's groinWhich way could that effect it The story of that Madam is long and interestingbut it would be running my history all upon heaps to give it you here'Tis for an episode hereafter and every circumstance relating to it in its proper place shall be faithfully laid  before you'Till then it is not in my power to give further light into this matter or say more than what I have said alreadyThat my uncle  Toby  was a gentleman of unparallel'd modesty which happening to be somewhat subtilized and rarified by the constant heat of a little familypridethey both so wrought together within him that he could never bear to hear the affair of my aunt DINAH touch'd upon but with the greatest emotionThe least hint of it was enough to make the blood fly into his facebut when my father enlarged upon the story in mixed companies which the illustration of his hypothesis frequently obliged him to dothe unfortunate blight of one of the fairest branches of the family would set my uncle  Toby  's honour and modesty o'bleeding and he would often take my father  aside in the greatest concern imaginable to expostulate and tell him he would give him any thing in the world only to let the story rest  My father I believe had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle  Toby  that ever one brother bore towards another and would have done any thing in nature which one brother in reason could have desir'd of another to have made my uncle  Toby  's heart easy in this or any other point But this lay out of his power  My father as I told you was a philosopher in grainspeculativesystematicaland my aunt  Dinah  's affair was a matter of as much consequence to him as the retrogradation of the planets to  Copernicus  The backslidings of  Venus  in her orbit fortified the  Copernican  system call'd so after his name and the backslidings of my aunt  Dinah  in her orbit did the same service in establishing my father's system which I trust will for ever hereafter be call'd the  Shandean System  after his  In any other family dishonour my father I believe had as nice a sense of shame as any man whateverand neither he nor I dare say  Copernicus  would have divulged the affair in either case or have taken the least notice of it to the world but for the obligations they owed as they thought to truth  Amicus Plato  my father would say construing the words to my uncle  Toby  as he went along  Amicus Plato  that is DINAH was my aunt  sed magis amica veritas  but TRUTH is my sister  This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle was the source of many a fraternal squabble The one could not bear to hear the tale of family disgrace recordedand the other would scarce ever let a day pass to an end without some hint at it  For God's sake my uncle  Toby  would cryand for my sake and for all our sakes my dear brother  Shandy  do let this story of our aunt's and her ashes sleep in peacehow can youhow can you have so little feeling and compassion for the character of our familyWhat is the character of a family to an hypothesis my father would replyNay if you come to thatwhat is the life of a familyThe life of a familymy uncle  Toby  would say throwing himself back in his armchair  and lifting up his hands his eyes and one legYes the lifemy father would say maintaining his point How many thousands of 'em are there every year that comes cast away in all civilized countries at leastand consider'd as nothing but common air in competition of an hypothesis In my plain sense of things my uncle  Toby  would answerevery such instance is downright MURDER let who will commit itThere lies your mistake my father would replyfor in  Foro Scientiae  there is no such thing as MURDER'tis only DEATH brother  My uncle  Toby  would never offer to answer this by any other kind of argument than that of whistling half a dozen bars of  Lillabullero  You must know  it was the usual channel thro' which his passions got vent when any thing shocked or surprised himbut especially when any thing which he deem'd very absurd was offered  AS not one of our logical writers nor any of the commentators upon them that I remember have thought proper to give a name to this particular species of argumentI here take the liberty to do it myself for two reasons First That in order to prevent all confusion in disputes it may stand as much distinguished for ever from every other species of argumentas the  Argumentum ad Verecundiam    ex Absurdo    ex Fortiori  or any other argument whatsoeverAnd secondly That it may be said by my children's children when my head is laid to restthat their learned grandfather's  head had been busied to as much purpose once as other people'sThat he had invented a nameand generously thrown it into the TREASURY of the  Ars Logica  for one of the most unanswerable arguments in the whole science And if the end of disputation is more to silence than convincethey may add if they please to one of the best arguments too  I do therefore by these presents strictly order and command That it be known and distinguished by the name and title of the  Argumentum Fistulatorium  and no otherand that it rank hereafter with the  Argumentum Baculinum  and the  Argumentum ad Crumenam  and for ever hereafter be treated of in the same chapter  As for the  Argumentum Tripodium  which is never used but by the woman against the manand the  Argumentum ad Rem  which contrarywise is made use of by the man only against the womanAs these two are enough in conscience for one lectureand moreover as the one is the best answer to the otherlet them likewise be kept apart and be treated of in a place by themselves  CHAP XXII  THE learned Bishop  Hall  I mean the famous Dr  Joseph Hall  who was Bishop of  Exeter  in King  James  the First's reign tells us in one of his  Decads  at the end of his divine art of meditation imprinted at  London  in the year by  John Beal  dwelling in  Aldersgatestreet    "That it is an abominable thing for a man to commend himself"and I really think it is so  And yet on the other hand when a thing is executed in a masterly kind of a fashion which thing is not likely to be found outI think it is full as abominable that a man should lose the honour of it and go out of the world with the conceit of it rotting in his head  This is precisely my situation  For in this long digression which I was accidentally led into as in all my digressions one only excepted there is a masterstroke of digressive skill the merit of which has all along I fear been overlooked by my readernot for want of penetration in himbut because 'tis  an excellence seldom looked for or expected indeed in a digressionand it is this That tho' my digressions are all fair as you observeand that I fly off from what I am about as far and as often too as any writer in  GreatBritain  yet I constantly take care to order affairs so that my main business does not stand still in my absence  I was just going for example to have given you the great outlines of my uncle  Toby  's most whimsical characterwhen my aunt  Dinah  and the coachman came across us and led us a vagary some millions of miles into the very heart of the planetary system Notwithstanding all this you perceive that the drawing of my uncle  Toby  's character went on gently all the timenot the great contours of itthat was impossiblebut some familiar  strokes and faint designations of it were here and there touch'd in as we went along so that you are much better acquainted with my uncle  Toby  now than you was before  By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by itself two contrary motions are introduced into it and reconciled which were thought to be at variance with each other In a word my work is digressive and it is progressive tooand at the same time  This Sir is a very different story from that of the earth's moving round her axis in her diurnal rotation with her progress in her elliptick orbit which brings about the year and constitutes that variety and vicissitude of seasons we enjoythough I own it suggested the  thoughtas I believe the greatest of our boasted improvements and discoveries have come from some such trifling hints  Digressions incontestably are the sunshinethey are the life the soul of readingtake them out of this book for instanceyou might as well take the book along with themone cold eternal winter would reign in every page of it restore them to the writerhe steps forth like a bridegroombids All hail brings in variety and forbids the appetite to fail  All the dexterity is in the good cookery and management of them so as to be not only for the advantage of the reader but also of the author whose distress in this matter is truely pitiable  For if he begins a digressionfrom that moment I observe his whole work stands stockstilland if he goes on with his main workthen there is an end of his digression  This is vile workFor which reason from the beginning of this you see I have constructed the main work and the adventitious parts of it with such intersections and have so complicated and involved the digressive and progessive movements one wheel within another that the whole machine in general has been kept agoingand what's more it shall be kept agoing these forty years if it pleases the fountain of health to bless me so long with life and good spirits  CHAP XXIII  I Have a strong propensity in me to begin this chapter very nonsensically and I will not balk my fancyAccordingly I set off thus  If the fixure of  Momus  's glass in the human breast according to the proposed emendation of that archcritick had taken placefirst This foolish consequence would certainly have followedThat the very wisest and the very gravest of us all in one coin or other must have paid windowmoney every day of our lives  And secondly That had the said glass been there set up nothing more would have been wanting in order to have taken  a man's character but to have taken a chair and gone softly as you would to a dioptrical beehive and look'd inview'd the soul stark nakedobserv'd all her motionsher machinationstraced all her maggots from their first engendering to their crawling forthwatched her loose in her frisks her gambols her capricios and ofter some notice of her more solemn deportment consequent upon such frisks  c  then taken your pen and ink and set down nothing but what you had seen and could have sworn toBut this is an advantage not to be had by the biographer in this planetin the planet  Mercury  belike it may be so if not better still for himfor there the intense heat of the country which is proved by computators from its vicinity to the sun to be more than equal to that  of red hot ironmust I think long ago have vitrified the bodies of the inhabitants as the efficient cause to suit them for the climate which is the final cause so that betwixt them both all the tenements of their souls from top to bottom may be nothing else for aught the soundest philosophy can shew to the contrary but one fine transparent body of clear glass bating the umbilical knotso that till the inhabitants grow old and tolerably wrinkled whereby the rays of light in passing through them become so monstrously refractedor return reflected from their surfaces in such transverse lines to the eye that a man cannot be seen thro'his soul might as well unless for more ceremonyor the trifling advantage which the umbilical point gave hermight upon all  other accounts I say as well play the fool out o'doors as in her own house  But this as I said above is not the case of the inhabitants of this earthour minds shine not through the body but are wrapt up here in a dark covering of uncrystalized flesh and blood so that if we would come to the specifick characters of them we must go some other way to work  Many in good truth are the ways which human wit has been forced to take to do this thing with exactness  Some for instance draw all their characters with wind instruments  Virgil  takes notice of that way in the affair of  Dido  and  Aeneas  but it is as fallacious as the breath of fameand moreover  bespeaks a narrow genius I am not ignorant that the  Italians  pretend to a mathematical exactness in their designations of one particular sort of character among them from the  forte  or  piano  of a certain wind instrument they usewhich they say is infallibleI dare not mention the name of the instrument in this place'tis sufficient we have it amongst usbut never think of making a drawing by itthis is aenigmatical and intended to be so at least  ad populum  And therefore I beg Madam when you come here that you read on as fast as you can and never stop to make any inquiry about it  There are others again who will draw a man's character from no other helps in the world but merely from his evacuationsbut this often gives a very incorrect  outlineunless indeed you take a sketch of his repletions too and by correcting one drawing from the other compound one good figure out of them both  I should have no objection to this method but that I think it must smell too strong of the lampand be render'd still more operose by forcing you to have an eye to the rest of his  NonNaturals  Why the most natural actions of a man's life should be call'd his NonNaturalsis another question  There are others fourthly who disdain every one of these expedientsnot from any fertility of his own but from the various ways of doing it which they have borrowed from the honourable devices  which the Pentagraphic Brethren  Pentagraph an instrument to copy prints and pictures mechanichally and in any proportion  of the brush have shewn in taking copiesThese you must know are your great historians  One of these you will see drawing a fulllength character  against the light  that's illiberaldishonestand hard upon the character of the man who sits  Others to mend the matter will make a drawing of you in the  Camera  that is most unfair of allbecause  there  you are sure to be represented in some of your most ridiculous attitudes  To avoid all and every one of these errors in giving you my uncle  Toby  's character I am determin'd to draw it by  no mechanical help whatevernor shall my pencil be guided by any one wind instrument which ever was blown upon either on this or on the other side of the  Alps  nor will I consider either his repletions or his dischargesor touch upon his NonNaturalsbut in a word I will draw my uncle  Toby  's character from his HOBBYHORSE  CHAP XXIV  IF I was not morally sure that the reader must be out of all patience for my uncle  Toby  's characterI would here previously have convinced him that there is no instrument so fit to draw such a thing with as that which I have pitch'd upon  A man and his HOBBYHORSE tho' I cannot say that they act and react exactly after the same manner in which the soul and body do upon each other Yet doubtless there is a communication between them of some kind and my opinion rather is that there is something in it more of the manner of electrified bodiesand that by means of the heated parts of the rider which come immediately into contact with the back of the HOBBYHORSEBy long journies and much friction it so happens that the body of the rider is at length fill'd as full of HOBBYHORSICAL matter as it can holdso that if you are able to give but a clear description of the nature of the one you may form a pretty exact notion of the genius and character of the other  NOW the HOBBYHORSE which my uncle  Toby  always rode upon was in my opinion an HOBBYHORSE well worth giving a description of if it was only upon the score of his great singularity for you might have travelled from  York  to  Dover  from  Dover  to  Penzance  in  Cornwall  and from  Penzance  to  York  back again and not have seen such another upon the road or if you had seen such a one whatever haste you had been in you must infallibly have stopp'd to have taken a view of him Indeed the gait and figure of him was so strange and so utterly unlike was he from his head to his tail to any one of the whole species that it was now and then made a matter of disputewhether he was really a HOBBYHORSE or no But as the Philosopher would use no other argument to the sceptic who disputed with him against  the reality of motion save that of rising up upon his legs and walking a cross the roomso would my uncle  Toby  use no other argument to prove his HOBBYHORSE was a HOBBYHORSE indeed but by getting upon his back and riding him aboutleaving the world after that to determine the point as it thought fit  In good truth my uncle  Toby  mounted him with so much pleasure and he carried my uncle  Toby  so wellthat he troubled his head very little with what the world either said or thought about it  It is now high time however that I give you a description of himBut to go on regularly I only beg you will give me leave to acquaint you first how my uncle  Toby  came by him  CHAP XXV  THE wound in my uncle  Toby  's groin which he received at the siege of  Namur  rendering him unfit for the service it was thought expedient he should return to  England  in order if possible to be set to rights  He was four years totally confinedpart of it to his bed and all of it to his room and in the course of his cure which was all that time in hand suffer'd unspeakable miseriesowing to a succession of exfoliations from the  oss pubis  and the outward edge of that part of the  coxendix  called the  oss illeum  both which bones were dismally crush'd as much by the irregularity of the stone which I told you was broke off the parapet  as by its sizethough it was pretty large which inclined the surgeon all along to think that the great injury which it had done my uncle  Toby  's groin was more owing to the gravity of the stone itself than to the projectile force of itwhich he would often tell him was a great happiness  My father at that time was just beginning business in  London  and had taken a houseand as the truest friendship and cordiality subsisted between the two brothersand that my father thought my uncle  Toby  could no where be so well nursed and taken care of as in his own househe assign'd him the very best apartment in itAnd what was a much more sincere mark of his affection still he would never suffer a friend or an acquaintance to step into the house on any  occasion but he would take him by the hand and lead him up stairs to see his brother  Toby  and chat an hour by his bed side  The history of a soldier's wound beguiles the pain of itmy uncle's visiters at least thought so and in their daily calls upon him from the courtesy arising out of that belief they would frequently turn the discourse to that subjectand from that subject the discourse would generally roll on to the siege itself  These conversations were infinitely kind and my uncle  Toby  received great relief from them and would have received much more but that they brought him into some unforeseen perplexities which for three months together retarded his cure greatly and if he had  not hit upon an expedient to extricate himself out of them I verily believe they would have laid him in his grave  What these perplexities of my uncle  Toby  were'tis impossible for you to guessif you couldI should blush not as a relationnot as a mannor even as a womanbut I should blush as an author inasmuch as I set no small store by myself upon this very account that my reader has never yet been able to guess at any thing And in this Sir I am of so nice and singular a humour that if I thought you was able to form the least judgment or probable conjecture to yourself of what was to come in the next pageI would tear it out of my book  END
