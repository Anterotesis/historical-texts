VOYAGE to the Island of LOVE  CHLOE  the following Piece peruse with Care  It of a most delicous Country treats  Nor is it difficult to travel there  You may  the Voyage make between the Sheets  A VOYAGE to the Island of LOVE  IT is but just dear  Bellamour  that I should let you hear from me and that after a Year's Absence you shou'd at last be deliver'd from the Uneasiness which the Uncertainty of my Fate has undoubtedly given you I have seen abundance of the World since my leaving you but am not sure whether in my present Condition I shall have Resolution enough to give you any tolerable Account of my Travels 'Tis adding to my present Affliction to call to mind my past Sorrows  and 'tis increasing my present Pain making my old Wounds bleed asresh to take a Survey even in Imagination of those Pleasures whereof nothing now is remaining but cruel Remembrance I believe however that it will be no small Consolation to me to communicate to one of my best Friends both my past Pleasures and Afflictions Complaining is some Ease to a Person in Misery I shall forget my Sorrows whilst I am relating my Adventures and for a Moment make a Truce with my Heartbreaking Anguish  'Tis now about a Year as you may remember since I embark'd on the wide Ocean with several other Persons of  all Ages  and  Conditions  but most of them  very giddyheaded  in search of a  delicious Country  named  Pleasure  whereof we had all of us heard a most inchanting Description Charm'd with the Thoughts of the Delights we were there to enjoy we sail'd for some Days peaceably and nothing was to be heard but Mirth and Gayety from one End of the Vessel to the other when pretty near an Island where we intended to have taken in Resreshments there arose so surious a Tempest and the Wind was so boisterous that in spite of the utmost Skill and Endeavours of the Pilot it drove us with Violence to a Coast quite opposite to that to which we were bound In this Condition we were  toss'd up and down between four and five Days after which the Weather began to clear up the Sun shone out with greater Lustre than ever and we found our selves not far off of a beautiful Island which seem'd almost cover'd with the most delightful Gardens or rather which seem'd one continued Garden and a second terrestrial Paradise Ravish'd with the numberless Beauties which every where offer'd themselves to our Eye we were all curious to know the Name of that inviting Country imagining it that to which we were bound and that the Pilot had put an agreeable Cheat upon us when he inform'd us that we had been driven so far out of our Way But there happen'd to be a Man on board the Ship who undeceived us having before made the Tour of the Island accordingly he gave us the following Information  This charming Isle which ravishes the Sight  Is sacred to the God of soft Desires  Who to all Mankind's Homage claims a Right  And ev'ry Breast inflames with am'rous Fires  None 'scape his Pow'r all feel the tingling Dart  The Young the Old the Monarch and the Slave  Who is exempt therefrom that has a Heart  The Weak the Strong the Coward or the Brave  Once in their Lives here all a Visit make  And quit their Home to see this happy Isle  Here their most ardent Wishes Center take  Dependent on the Fair One's Frown or Smile  Ten Thousand different Ways you here may land  No Wind's amiss to bring you into Port  No Chains no Guards to bar the Entrance stand  All Sides lie open for a free Resort  Th'  Agreeables  the  Beauties Graces Charms  Have all the Ports committed to their Care  And making use of  Love  's resistless Arms  Let fly at all and not a Heart they spare  Whilst this Man was giving us this Information we still drew nearer and nearer to the Island till by that Time he had made an End we were come so nigh that we cou'd distinguish every Object  Here the still Ocean quiet flows  As the least Chrystal purling Streams  No Wind but the soft  Zephyr  blows  And o'er the level Surface skims  Whose pleasing Murmurs whilst you hear  In sporting with the wanton Seas  That Nature's Self did sleep you'd swear  And therefore left the World at Peace  A Thousand Flowers along the Shore  The Pink the Lilly and the Rose  With Pleasure vye their beauteous Store  Yet the least Wonders there disclose  In Effect all along the Shore one sees an infinite Number of Things that create Admiration all the  Beauties  and  Graces  all that is  agreeable  and  charming  is perpetually to be beheld there but what surprized me the most was to observe both the  Old  and the  Ugly  in Company with the  Agreeables  I could not forbear expressing my Astonishment thereat whereupon the same Man who had given us the abovementioned Information instructed me farther as follows  Love  with his Darts does ev'ry Mortal wound  And as he's the most powerful of Kings  That on Earth in Sea or in Heav'n is found  By various Means all in Subjection brings  Thus 'tis that he to aggravate the Pains  Of those who insolent his Pow'r deride  Makes them of worthless Objects wear the Chains  And tremble at that  God  they once defy'd  Whilst he was thus instructing me I was wholly taken up with gazing with an Attention that is not usual with me upon a young Lady who was  walking upon the Sea Shore she was in the Midst of the  Beauties  and  Graces  and eclipsed their Brightness by the Lustre of her Charms I must own to you that she gain'd a Conquest over me at first Sight  For all the various Charms that can adorn  A blooming Virgin in her Person met  A Milkwhite Skin Cheeks rosy as the Morn  A Mouth with even Rows of Ivory set  Lips Coral red and suing to be press'd  Eyes that would stir an Anchoret's Desire  A Faultless Shape imagine all the Rest  Then say who would not at her Feet expire  In the mean while Ten or a Dozen little Boats loosed from the Shore these Boats were all embellish'd with the most beauteous Flowers and their Cordage was of Silk of a hundred different Colours Several little  Cupids  were the Rowers to conduct these Boats whilst numberless  Zephyrs  flying round them and fanning the Flowers continually with their gentle Breezes filled the Air with an agreeable Odour and at the same Time wafted the little Fleet to us in Peace  When they were come up with our Vessel we were entertained with an admirable Concert  of Musick wherein some exquisite fine Voices sung as follows  Ye Mortals who inflam'd with am'rous Fires  Would of this  Life  the choicest Pleasures prove  Come to our Isle and there have your Desires  There is no solid Pleasure without Love  At the same Time the  Zephyrs  hovering around us stretched out their Hands and with a sweet Smile seemed to invite us to accompany them All these surprizing Wonders had charmed me to such a Degree that I was no longer Master of myself That inchanting Beauty whom I had seen and whom I burnt with Impatience of Rejoining with somewhat I know not what that seized my Heart at the same Instant made me resolve to go ashore upon the Island accordingly I held out my Hands and the  Zephyrs  took me up and carried me into a Boat where the little  Cupids  received me with a thousand Demonstrations of Kindness  There were several in our Vessel who followed my Example but there were others likewise who stay'd behind and laugh'd at us insomuch that I was astonished at their Inflexibility when they cry'd after us jearing  Go giddy Heads those real Pleasures taste  Which in  Love  's Vanities are to be found  You'll tell your Thoughts thereof when once they're past  If e'er you 'scape from that inchanted Ground  In the mean While we made the best of our Way accompanied with Consorts of Musick and covered with Flowers and in a little While we got safe ashore  Soon as one lands a Goddess charming fair  The Mistress of the  Prudent  and  Discreet  Reason  whose Eyes so bright and Piercing are  Obstructs our passing on and crys  Retreat  But oh the dazzled Sense denies its Aid  And hides her beauteous Features from our Eyes  'Till left amidst her Foes the charming Maid  Finds that no Man in Love was ever wise  Accordingly I went on without minding her  Preaching  and ran full of Impatience towards the Place where I had seen the inchanting Creature who had induced me to land in that Country but just as I approached her a Man whom I saw near her struck a Terror into me with a single Look He was tall and of a good Mein but very grave and serious his Eyes were very modest and his  Aspect very submissive and when he looked upon me he held his Finger upon his Mouth like the Figure of the God  Silence  A young Maiden accompanied him who trode in his very Steps and mimick'd his every Action and Gesture looking at every Turn round about her to see if she was observed A little  Love  who from that Time devoted himself to my Service to bear me Company in my Travels and to instruct me gave me the following Information  He whom you there behold with Looks severe  Is call'd  Respect  and is the Child of Love  Got on  Esteem  great is his Credit here  Him therefore court if you'd successful prove  They who neglect to follow his Advice  Are very seldom Fav'rites with the  Fair  To buy his Friendship  Silence  is the Price  And even the Language of the Eyes forbear  She who so constant on his Steps does wait  Is call'd  Precaution  circumspect and wise  Of discreet Love th'inseparable Mate  In Love one must have every Way one's Eyes  Being instructed by such a good Master I paid great Civility to  Respect  and  Precaution  and desired their Friendship which they both granted me with a very good Grace This done I advanced  trembling towards the fair One who had charm'd me and begged her to do me the Honour to let me hand her which she granted with Haughtiness enough and after having talked for some Time about Things indifferent she left me and went her Way  As Night drew on  Love  conducted me to a little Village that was very near where I had a very sorry Lodging This Village is called  Anxiety  from the Name of the Lady of the Mannor to whom we made a Visit It is hardly possible to give you a tolerable Description of this Woman for she cannot sit one Moment in the same Place or Posture One Minute she is standing another Minute she lies down sometimes she walks a Snail's Pace at another Time she runs so swift it is impossible to keep up with her she never sleeps which makes her very lean and hagged then she is very negligent of herself having her Hair always dishevell'd and in terrible Disorder but especially about her Forehead by Reason she is osten rubbing it After having paid my Respects to her whereof she took no Manner of Notice I went to my Lodging and laid me down upon a Bed but could get no Rest the beautiful Charmer being always present in my Thought which caused me to make the following Reflection  My Words disjointed are and wild  Continual Sighs break off my Speech  I'm of my Liberty beguil'd  And Reason's Aid in vain beseech  Has not  Zelinda  charming Queen  Bound my Heart Captive in her Chains  E'er I her beauteous Face had seen  I never felt such cruel Pains  Next Morning I arose very early and  Love  conducted me to another Village whose Name is  Courtship  it is very different from  Anxiety  being in my Opinion one of the most agreeable Places in the whole Country  There one may tender Lovers see  In Crowds flock thither every Day  Near th'Object of their Vows to be  And with them sport the Time away  There ev'ry House is deck'd with Flow'rs  All seems magnificent and gay  In Feasts and Balls they spend the Hours  And Care and Sorrow put away  All Vice is likewise banish'd thence  Nor suffered in this blest Retreat  Ev'n Misers lavish there their Pence  Bless'd if therewith a Smile they get  Nay the most froward Mortals strive  Themselves agreeable to make  And the most stupid Sotts alive  Learn Wit and off their Folly shake  The Pensive too no longer dumb  Finds there a Tongue and talks with Ease  In short there's none who thither come  But study all they can to please  In Effect there is nothing to be seen there but continual Gallantry Neatness Magnificence Complaisancy and good Humour reside there perpetually in short every Thing there is done with the best Grace in the World  As soon as I arrived there I found myself in the most complaisant Humour imaginable besides which nothing could be more ingenious at inventing new Pleasures to divert  Zelinda  With this Design after having dressed myself very genteelly  Love  conducted me to visit her better satisfied with myself than I had ever before been in my Life but we were forced at Night to return and lie at  Anxiety  because there is no Lodging to be had at  Courtship  insomuch that I passed that Night again very disagreeably through my Impatience to see  Zelinda  and enjoyed but one Hour's sound Repose wherein my sleeping Fancy  entertained me with a Dream that was perfectly agreeable  Methought I saw my charming Dear  Within my Arms expiring lye  But she reviv'd more killing Fair  So sweet the Death was she did dye  Methought I saw a While o'ercast  The wonted Lustre of her Eyes  'Till languishing she sunk at last  Upon my Breast in Extasies  But on my waking I perceiv'd  'Twas all a fleeting Dream no more  And griev'd in Sleep to be deceiv'd  To wake more wretched than before  I returned early next Morning to  Courtship  where I was daily better and better treated by  Zelinda  insomuch that the Nights which I was forced to pass at  Anxiety  gave me very little Disquiet but after some Time having done all that lay in my Power to appear agreeable in  Zelinda  's Eyes she went one Day to another Village which is call'd  Good Reception  from the Name of the Lord of the Manor who is the most obliging and most complaisant Man in the World He is mighty easy of Access and receives every Body very well The Inhabitants of  the Place are likewise mighty civil and  Zelinda  being willing to be conformable after the Example of others treated me very obligingly and gave me Room to imagine by her Behaviour that she was not at all displeased at the Sight of me  Hereupon  Love  conducted me to  Hope  where I took up my Lodging it being a large and beautiful City vastly populous by Reason of the daily Arrival of Thousands who flock thither from all Parts Nevertheless the greatest Part of this City is built upon  Sand  and without any  Foundation  which makes it very often fall to Ruin But the other Part stands upon a pretty good Foundation for which Reason it has almost always continued in its first State This whole City is situated upon the River  Pretensions  which takes its Rise from a Mountain of the same Name bordering upon  Hope  This River is perfectly pleasant but it is dangerous imbarking thereon which is the very Reason why the Houses built upon its Banks are generally thrown down but whilst they remain standing the finest Palaces don't equal them for Beauty of their Prospect  This pleasant River is famous for the Ruin of divers illustrious Persons nevertheless I was tempted to bathe myself therein and  Love  would have let me plunge in inconsiderately enough when I met  Respect  followed by  Precaution  who  stop'd me by the Arm and told me that it was the ready Way to ruin me and that I ought to be contented with continuing in  Hope  without going to expose myself in the dangerous River  Pretensions  Hereupon I thank'd him for his good Advice and took a Walk towards that Part of the Town which is farthest from the River There it is that the Palace of the Princess  Hope  stands who is reckoned the Oracle of the Island of  Love  although it is not very safe relying upon what she says for  Fair Promises she always makes  Which Promises full oft she breaks  In Love to persevere decoys  And buoys us up with promis'd Joys  Nay often bids those Wretches live  Who the next Hour their Doom receive  By entering her Palace one meets the  Thoughts  which are always upon the Wing and fly sometimes  high  sometimes  low  and sometimes in the  Middle of the Air  according as the Fancy takes them for my Part I happened upon such as were discreet enough for they always kept an even Flight I went afterwards to see the Princess  Hope  who is actually a very amiable Lady  She has a perpetual Smile in her Countenance and a most sweet and most engaging Look one is never tired of her Company she comforts the most afflicted animates the Courage of the Proud and flatters agreeably those who are not unreasonable in their Desires when I went to pay her my Respects two Men entered her Apartment at the same Time with me one whereof had placed his Affections on one so much his Superior that he durst not promise himself any good Issue from his Passion and the other who was in the same Case hoped for all Things from his good Fortune I must own I could not help admiring the artful Address of the Princess in comforting one and animating the other To the first she said  Time  and  Respect  o'ercome all Obstacles  And  Love  unshaken may do Miracles  And turning to the other said  'Tis great and glorious sure she cry'd  T'abase a haughty Beauty's Pride  And when you make th' Attempt in vain  'Tis great by Death to end your Pain  As for my Part when I had told my Case  as she found me not to be unreasonable she said  You all may hope for from your prudent Love  And the Fair one Day will your Flames approve  Although I very well knew that she constantly flattered every Body I could not help being delighted with her Answer and it left such a pleasing Impression upon my Mind that I rested better that Night than I had done some Time before and the next Morning  Love  would have conducted me to  Declaration  But as we were on the Way thither we were again met by  Respect  who was very much out of Humour and told me that I ought not to be in such PostHaste he even reprimanded  Love  pretty sharply which the little Tyrant not being able to bear with any Manner of Patience cryed out in a great Passion  What always sigh and bear eternal Pains  Always love on and wear a Tyrant's Chains  Perhaps too dye at last and yet not dare  At the last Gasp one's Suff'rings to declare  Or know when a poor Wretch expiring lies  If she who caus'd his Death will with him sympathize  Must one to happy be the Venture run  Whether the cruel Fair e'er Life be gone  Laying aside her Haughtiness will deign  To take some Pity and to end his Pain  And not consider it may be too late  And  Culprit  first may have resign'd to Fate  Hereupon  Respect  told him that should not be my Case and that if I would be advised by him my Passion should be soon known without going to  Declaration  That as for the rest I should always find  Zelinda  at the Place to which he would conduct me whereas she would perhaps stay but one Day at  Declaration  after which I should never see her more I suffered myself to be prevailed on by these Reasons notwithstanding all that  Love  could urge to the contrary and went with him to a strong Fortress whereof he is Governor It is a Citadel well fortified with several impregnable Bastions whose Walls are so high that the Eye cannot reach the Top of them and so strong and so thick that it is impossible to shake them  Modesty Silence  and  Secresy  guard the only Gate there is to this Fortress which nevertheless is but a very little Wicket  Modesty  is a Woman of great Gravity but without affecting to appear so her Eyes have a resolute Look accompanied with a great deal of Reservedness and she goes always very  plainly dress'd having her Arms and her Neck continually covered up very close so as not to be seen by any one especially any Men  Silence  exactly resembles the Pictures you have seen of him having a sullen Look with his Eyes and holding always one Finger upon his Mouth As for  Secresy  he is hardly ever to be seen keeping himself generally concealed in an obscure Corner whence he never stirs out but when it is very seasonable and if he speaks sometimes it is very low and in a Whisper but he has excellent Parts and his Sagacity is so great that he understands every Body at the least Sign in the World He entered this Citadel in the Retinue of  Respect  without speaking a Word and almost by Stealth and we saw that  In close Retirement lives each Family  And all is done with th'utmost Privacy  No Balls or Serenades alarm the Ear  Nor i'th Streets any but at Night appear  All Persons there their own Affairs attend  Without intrusting Confident or Friend  There Lovers seldom meet but keep away  Forc'd a Constraint on their Desires to lay  There they must suffer yet not dare complain  Tho' then oppress'd with the most cruel Pain  This is the School where Lovers learn to try  The soft persuesive Language of the Eye  That silent Language which so well imparts  The inmost Thoughts and Wishes of our Hearts  Which without speaking can the Mind explain  And tell us all its Joy and all its Pain  This Citadel is called  Discretion  from the Name of the Daughter of  Respect  whom he has made his Deputy and who commands the Fortress under him She is a Lady of great Beauty though not of the Sort that pleases at first Sight but they who are used to her Company are very fond of her Conversation Her Eyes are inexpressibly piercing and lively insomuch that when they please they can make themselves understood by every Body and she has the Look of a Person of the greatest Modesty and Reservedness through which nevertheless one may discover abundance of Address and Wit which she never fails to make use of whenever she sees Occasion  After paying my Respects to her I inquired artfully where  Zelinda  lodged which when I was informed I took up my Quarters in a House that was a good Distance from thence and even when I chanced to meet her all my Discourse was upon Subjects quite different from Love Thus did I continue a considerable Time in the Citadel  leading a very miserable Life and holding no Correspondence with any  With falling Tears my Cheeks I stain'd  With Grief and Anguish worn away  'Till but a Skeleton remain'd  Of  Strephon  once so blithe and gay  Yet I ne'er let  Zelinda  hear  My Groans or in the least complain  But waited with Respect and Fear  'Till she or Death should end my Pain  The little  Love  my Companion and Instructor took Compassion on me and would have left me but I expressed such a Value and so much Kindness for him that he could not resolve absolutely upon it  After some Time I became yet more miserable than ever for  Zelinda  having discovered my Love by my Actions removed from thence and took up her Abode in the Cave of  Cruelty  This Cave is in the Hole of a Rock so steep and rugged that it is very difficult to ascend it the Entrance is forbidden to all Lovers for which Reason there is a strong Guard of Tygers placed at the Mouth to prevent their getting in I would have stopped  Zelinda  just as she was upon the Point of entering but was hind'red by a Woman  of the largest Size who was very ugly and had a Savage Look Her Eyes sticks out of her Head she has great lean long Arms with prodigious long Nails like Eagle's Talons treats every Body with a great deal of Haughtiness and Contempt and takes a Pleasure in torm enting all who approach her in short one only of her Looks is enough to cause Despair  Her Name is  Cruelty  Love's deadly Foe  Whose sole Delight's in Misery and Woe  A hideous Monster dreadful to the Sight  From whom one single Look the boldest would affright  Yet is she join'd so 'tis decreed by Fate  To  Youth  and  Beauty  as their constant Mate  For my Part I was struck with such a Terror on her first Approach that not being able to support her Looks I withdrew hastily and went to the Side of a large Torrent which falls with Violence from the Top of the Rock  From Lovers Eyes this Torrent takes its Source  Whose streaming Tears its rapid Channel fill  And down the Rock precipitates its Course  Whilst with its Fall resounds each neighb'ring Hill  Its flowing Streams soften the hardest Stone  Its plaintive Murmurs fill the Woods around  Stern  Cruelty  remains unmov'd alone  Whilst Trees and Rocks are melted with the Sound  This Torrent is surrounded by a very thick and gloomy Forest whose Trees all bear the Marks of some disconsolate Lover their Bark being all full of their melancholy Stones and Complaints the whole Forest resounds with nothing but Cries and Reproaches and that talkative Nymph  Eccho  repeats nothing but mournful and lamentable Expostulations in short one hears nothing but Death talked of in this dismal Place It was there that despairing of being ever able to draw  Zelinda  out of the Arms of  Cruelty  I frequently cry'd out  Alas  Zelinda  cruel and severe  Won't Death at least draw from your Eyes a Tear  These Woods and Rocks are soften'd with my Grief  And had they Pow'r would give me some Relief  But you  Zelinda  cruel beauteous Fair  Cause all my Woes yet leave me to despair  Thus did I make all the neighbouring Ecchoes resound with my Complaints never having any Rest nor ceasing from shedding Floods of Tears My usual Employment was to walk round the Rock where I sometimes met  Zelinda  but she was always in Company with  Cruelty  whom I endeavour'd in vain to mollify by all Manner of Submissions At last one Day when I was in a more despairing Temper of Mind than I had ever been before  Love  conducted me to the Side of a certain Lake  Despair  's dire Lake where Nymphs and Swains forlorn  Cease to be Objects of their Victor's Scorn  Hopeless to be belov'd worn out with Pain  And having languish'd Months and Years in vain  Finding their Loves inexorable quite  And liftless without them to bear the Light  Thither they come resolv'd to end the Strife  And put an End at once to Love and Life  Birds of ill Omen hover in the Air  And by their croaking Noise inspire  Despair  Whilst Thousands of wild Swans a Consort make  And sing their mournful Dirges on the Lake  Whose plaintive Harmony and dying Strains  Seem to lament th' expiring Lovers Pains  Several disconsolate Lovers walk along the Sides of the Lake and I saw some who threw themselves into it headlong I was once tempted to do the same but before I attempted to put the desperate Design in Execution a Design to which Nature is always repugnant I imagin'd it better upon second Thoughts to endeavour once more to mollify  Zelinda  and that Monster  Cruelty  To this Purpose I went and laid myself at the Entrance of the Cave with a firm Resolution never to stir from thence till I should see  Zelinda  come out There it was that by a Flood of Tears and innumerable heartbreaking Sighs I made my Complaints heard even to the Bottom of the Cave for which I was frequently very ill used by  Cruelty  In short I believe I should at last have sunk under my Pains if  Love  had not given me a Piece of very wholesome Counsel which sav'd my Life One Day when I was swallow'd up with Grief I saw a very agreeable Maiden pass by me who shed Tears as she looked upon me and seem'd by her Countenance to bestow those Tears upon my Misfortunes  Alas she seem'd to say unhappy Swain  How do I pity all thy Grief and Pain  Thy tender Passion and thy ardent Love  Deserv'd not that thy Fair should cruel prove  I thought myself so much obliged to this Maiden that I ask'd her Name and  Love  told me that it was  Pity  who used frequently to come thus and endeavour to oblige some unfortunate Lover and that if she wou'd espouse my Cause she wou'd certainly engage  Zelinda  to come out of the Cave of  Cruelty  In order to follow his Counsel I endeavour'd to prevail upon  Pity  by letting her know my deplorable Condition which she was so much moved with that she promis'd to use her utmost Efforts to assist me Accordingly it was not long before she made me sensible of the good Effects of her Promises for taking a Turn round the Rock she at last discover'd  Zelinda  and with Tears in her Eyes gave her an Account of my melancholy Condition and that in such moving Language that it drew likewise Tears from the beauteous Eyes of the inhuman Fair One  Pity  finding she had moved her Compassion conducted her to the Place where I lay and shew'd her the miserable State to which she had reduced me  Zelinda  could not help being sensibly affected with the melancholy Sight and accordingly not only began to give Ear to my amorous Reproaches  but approved thereof and at last resolved to put an End to them  Cruelty  who was informed of her Design wou'd have prevented it but  Pity  thrust her back very roughly and restored  Zelinda  to me who raising me up said  Strephon  at length thy Passion I approve  Thank  Pity  here the beauteous Child of  Love  Her Words have forc'd their Passage to my Breast  And me with tender Thoughts of thee possess'd  Live then I give thee Leave fond  Strephon  live  And with this pleasing Hope thy Heart revive  That with thy Passion won I shall one Day  With endless  Love  thy Constancy repay  'Tis impossible to express the Joy I felt at these Words I saw myself in a Moment from the most miserable of Mankind become the happiest Mortal in the Universe insomuch that in my Raptures I cry'd out  Rejoice my Heart  Zelinda  is appeas'd  No longer think then on thy Suff'rings past  But prize that Life wherewith she's not displeas'd  And think what Joys may crown it at the last  When on the dreadful Brink of Death thou stood'st  Her beauteous Hand uprais'd thee from the Grave  In common Justice then my Heart thou shoud'st  Devote to her that Life which she did save  Behold me then more happy than I ever durst have hoped to have been insomuch that I bless'd a Thousand Times a Day all the Pains I had suffer'd and they vanish'd from my Thoughts in a Moment  But  Pity  did not rest contented with bringing  Zelinda  out of that disagreeable Abode she likewise carried her on to  Confidence  and then left us to go and assist some other Lover in Distress I conjured her however at parting to remember that I shou'd always stand in need of her Good Offices whereupon she promised me her Assistance in Case of Necessity and which was more committed us into the Hands of  Confidence  who own'd the Village where she took Leave of us  This Village properly speaking is but a PleasureHouse but the most agreeable in my Opinion in the whole Island As to  Confidence  she is a Maiden Lady who has an open frank Look insomuch that one may read the inmost Recesses of her Heart and not be mistaken in one's Sentiments She is of the most even Temper  in the World always the same and there is no manner of Restraint but every one enjoys full Liberty in her House There it is that Lovers keep their  Rendezvous  in little winding Groves whose Avenues are very secret and where they are not disturbed  There it is that they have the Pleasure of talking with each other the whole Day without being tired And there it is that they see each other every Hour and yet think they don't see each other enough There they enjoy each others Conversation in private and have the pleasing Satisfaction of seeking a Thousand different Ways of seeing or talking to each other by Stealth  Billetdoux  also pass there between each other very frequently In short I spent very many happy Days there and indeed the happiest of my Life for I was continually with  Zelinda  she told me all her Thoughts and I did not conceal from her any of mine  What Pleasures past expressing I possest  How was my Soul with rapt'rous Transports blest  How sweetly had I past Life's irksome Stage  Free from those Passions that within me rage  Had my Desires but Moderation known  And I contented press'd no farther on  I met  Zelinda  wheresoe'er I went  And spoke my Mind to her without Restraint  All the Proofs of Friendship that cou'd be desired and even some Testimonies of Affection I easily obtain'd after some few Intreaties in short I liv'd the most agreeable Life in the World if I cou'd have been satisfied with it but  Love  perpetually urged me to carry her to his Temple and I was always sure of being out of her Favour whenever I proposed to her to go thither  At last however after many fruitless Intreaties we went together from the Village of  Confidence  but were hardly got out of it when a Man who seem'd to be a Person of Authority met us directly and with a strong Arm took  Zelinda  with Violence from me Notwithstanding his Incivility I cou'd not help respecting him and as I wou'd have appeas'd him without designing to look upon me he led  Zelinda  a quite contrary Way and all she cou'd do was to cry out  Strephon  farewell I dare no longer stay  Duty  against my Will drags me away  Yet live however better Days await  And keep thy Faith to me inviolate  I remain'd immoveable at this Sight and saw her go away without speaking one Word however after some Hesitation my first Resolution was to run after her and wrest her from the Arms of  Duty  by main Force but  Respect  and  Precaution  who happen'd to come by very seasonably prevented me This accidental Meeting anger'd me at the first but I had always reap'd so much Benefit by their Advice that I was resolved still to follow it  Hereupon I retired to a neighbouring Desart which seemed agreeable to my Humour 'I'is a large Valley surrounded with several Mountains and very remote from all Manner of Correspondence where there is a Castle situated in the midst of a great Wood which is the continual Abode of a melancholy Female called  Absence  She is very seldom to be seen having her Eyes always drowned in Tears and being consequently very much dejected and disfigured She is always in Mourning and perpetually accompanied by  Thoughtfulness  who is also mighty lean never fixing her Eyes long upon any single Object but looking upon every Thing and yet seeing Nothing She takes no Notice nor gives the least Attention to any Thing neither does she ever speak but quite foreign to the Purpose and hardly ever gives an Answer to what is asked of her in  short she seems to be collected within herself and to love no Company but her own The Fall of Waters and their soft Murmers and the singing of Birds are her ordinary Diversions Hereupon I entered into a strict Friendship with her and conformed myself entirely to her Manner of living retiring with my Sorrows to the greatest Solitudes and conversing alone in the same Manner as she with the Woods the Brooks the Ecchoes and the Springs  In the mean while I suffered a Thousand afflicting Torments having always a longing Desire to see  Zelinda  and not being able to satisfy that Desire what I thought most grievous of all in that Place was that the Time is longer than in any other Place in the World the Moments being Hours the Hours Days and the Days Years Besides this one meets every where with  Troubles  which are great gigantick Mortals of a very disagreeable Aspect and they are so numerous that there's no avoiding them At last being weary of living in such cruel Torment and ready to sink under it I composed the following Verses  'Tis then decreed above that I must dye  My deadly Pains admit no Remedy  And what's in vain apply'd to give me Ease  But more exasperates the fierce Disease  Thy shortliv'd Pleasures all my Soul are dead  Zelinda  is for ever from thee fled  Then cease to murmur longer and repine  And losing her thy hated Life resign  Far from the Fair who was my sole Delight  Far from those Eyes which only charm'd my Sight  By various Passions toss'd my wounded Soul  To each is made a Prey without Controul  Of my once pleasing Flame nought now remains  But cutting Sorrows and Heartwounding Pains  'Till my sad Days in deadly Langour pass'd  Quite sink me down in endless Night at last  Absence  does still a Cure effectual prove  For the Soulvexing Mem'ry of one's  Love  But woe is me to quench my raging Flame  In vain I court the melancholy Dame  True from  Zelinda  's  Love  she'as banish'd me  And from her pleasing Talk and Company  But her bright Charms whose Pow'r too well I know  Are ever present to increase my Woe  Thus I experienced the cruel Pains which  Absence  makes poor Lovers suffer and had no other Comfort but some Letters which  Love  found the  Means to get conveyed to me nevertheless I should not have lived long if  Zelinda  's having at last got free from  Duty  had not recalled me from my Exile This made me in a Moment forget all my past Pains and run to see her again with all the Impatience of an ardent Lover but I was not much happier for the Change of my Condition for I found her in a Place where no one yet ever enjoyed any Repose  There all are upon groundless Quarrels bent  And Duelling is hourly their Intent  Fully resolv'd their fancy'd Foes to end  Without respecting Brother Prince or Friend  There  Rage Suspicion Anger Envy  shed  Their dang'rous Poison upon ev'ry Head  'Till by their own or other Hands to fall  All seek For Fraud and Horrour reigns o'er all  This Place is called the  Rivals  whither I was no sooner come but I saw several Persons about  Zelinda  who redden'd with Anger on seeing me and prevented my speaking to her I felt within myself a secret Hatred and Aversion to them all and a little after thinking that  Zelinda  looked upon them too kindly I suffered myself to be conducted by  Love  to the Palace of  Jealousy  which is adjacent to the  Rivals  This Palace is yet a much more disagreeable Place than any of the rest for even  Absence  and  Cruelty  don't make one suffer half the Ills that one suffers in  Jealousy  Continual Winds Rains and Tempests render this a very unpleasant Place to reside in the Thunder growls there perpetually over one's Head and the Sky is very dark and multiplies every Object the least Shaddow strikes one there with Terrour and the whole Place is full of Precipices where People are often lost by Reason of the Darkness that reigns throughout the Whole  At the Entrance of this Palace We meet with  Passion Idle Fancies  and  Perturbation of Mind  which bewitch the Eyes in such a Manner that one sees every Thing the wrong Way  Passion  is always in a Fury without knowing any Reason why speaks very precipitately and says every Thing unreasonably and without any Order or Connection  Perturbation of Mind  is startled and disturbed at the least Thing in the World and is astonished at a meer Nothing And  Idle Fancies  are always creating their own Misfortunes because they form to themselves vain Phantoms which prove their own Torment All these Persons at my Entrance made me take a certain Draught which transformed me into quite another Man than I was before  Suspicious hot and diffident I grew  To me my Heat seem'd reasonable too  My self my self tormented to my Shame  Till every Object troublesome became  In this miserable State I went to visit  Jealousy  who is very ugly and very lean besides her being cover'd with Serpents which are perpetually gnawing her Entrails Her Look is full of Horrour and she sees not any Thing which she does not envy As soon as I entered the Room where she was she threw one of her Serpents at me which in the Fury I was then in exasperated me yet ten times more insomuch that I ran up and down every where without knowing whither I was going or to what End When I met  Zelinda  in Company I durst not approach her and trembled in my very Soul but then I endeavour'd to overhear what was said to her and her Answers and I wrested every Word she spoke to such a Sense as might torment my self When any one whisper'd her I turn'd as pale as Death immediately and interpreted the least Action and the least Gesture in Favour of others and when I did not see her I imagin'd her in the Arms of some happier Rival If she was alone I fancy'd she was waiting for some Body in short in my Phrenzy I was jealous of  every Thing I saw and even of Things inanimate  Ye Trees and Flow'rs I in my Transports cry'd  Where does  Zelinda  from her  Strephon  hide  You are the Confidents of all her Cares  With you she spends whole Days whilst I'm in Tears  Woe is me wretched Man if my Ingrate  Had to me kept her Faith inviolate  Why does she more delight in you than me  And why for Yours avoid my Company  In the mean While  Zelinda  who saw my Weakness did but smile at it at the Beginning but afterwards she resented it highly and then it was that I became acquainted with a Man who would have cured me both of my  Love  and  Jealousy  at the same Time his Name was  Spite  The mortal Enemy of Pain  Who when he's ill us'd by the Fair  Don't whining stand and sue in vain  Or give himself up to Despair  But arm'd with a Resentment brave  He wisely makes a quick Retreat  And often does a Lover save  From an entire and sad Defeat  Stung with the  Falshood  of my Fair  No more to  Love  a Vow I made  And  Spite  so far prevail'd I swear  That three whole Days from her I staid  But  Grief  and  Care  still stuck so close  And o'er my Soul had so much Pow'r  To dye her Slave I rather chose  Than cease so many Charms t'adore  I return'd then with more Violence than ever to my jealous Suspicions but after a considerable Time  Zelinda  grew weary of seeing me in so deplorable a Condition and  Pity  who had promised me her Assistance in Case of Necessity was as good as her Word and remov'd from  Zelinda  every Object that might give me any Vexation and brought me away with much Difficulty from a Place so disagreeable  Zelinda  too undeceived me as I came out and convinced me of all my Faults and Mistakes upon which I fell at her Feet and asking her a thousand Pardons cry'd  With Scorn and Rigour arm your Eyes  Be haughty cruel and severe  If Anger in my Breast arise  I'll stifle it and keep it there  No no whatever Pains I bear  Though Grief be painted in my Eyes  Ne'er shall my Heart rebellious dare  Repine or say You tyrannize  Perhaps I languishing may mourn  And beg You not to be severe  But shou'd my Breast with Anger burn  I'll stifle it and keep it there  Nevertheless  Zelinda  did not immediately seal my Pardon it was even with some Difficulty that she brought herself to support my Presence since I had been capable of so much Weakness Whereupon I endeavour'd to appease her by saying  Think think how cutting is the Grief  When gall'd by a proud Beauty's Chain  To see the cruel lovely Thief  Does only laugh at all our Pain  Think that a Lover can not live  Unless he sees whom he adores  And give me Hopes your Heart forgives  And me to Favour once restores  Since though I've lightly been to blame  And grossly wrong'd my Charming Fair  Enough I have atton'd the same  By my sad Suff'ring and Despair  At last my Tears and Intreaties together with the natural Inclination she had for me as she had confess'd to me at  Confidence  prevail'd on her to receive me again into Favour In short after many Difficulties We arrived at the Metropolis of the Kingdom of  Love  which is call'd after the Name of the Island and where the Court is kept which is beyond Expression splendid and agreeable being composed of all Sorts of Nations Ranks and Degrees Kings Princes and Subjects notwithstanding which no one there is a greater Man than another  This City is very large and every Thing there is in Confusion Persons of Merit are join'd there very often with those who have none and such as are handsome frequently leave all for those that are homely which sufficiently shews that the God who presides there is blind In the Middle of the City is a very famous Temple which is older than the World for  Love  was there when he unravell'd the Chaos This Temple is very spatious notwithstanding which it is hardly large enough to receive all the Sacrifices that are offer'd up there every Day  We went thither also to offer up our Sacrifices according to Custom and on our Entrance were obliged to deliver up the Victims which were our Hearts  Zelinda  still made some Difficulty  of parting with hers but  Desire  at last snatch'd it away not without some little Violence Our Hearts then were offered up in Sacrifices to  Love  and the Flame which burnt them did not consume them insomuch that after the Sacrifice we found them still both entire but burning  And which perhaps may seem most strange  We of our Hearts made an Exchange  Zelinda  seizing first on mine  Did thereby her's to me resign  Thus I of her's became possess'd  And treasur'd it up in my Breast  Behold me then arriv'd at the Height of all my Wishes I continued therefore some Time in the City enjoying all the Pleasures whereof Man is capable in being tenderly beloved that is to say  I was her sole Delight with me  She always cou'd have wish'd to be  In all my Griefs still bore a Share  And my least Hurt made her despair  But this was not enough for me I was still dissatisfy'd for I was bent upon carrying her to the Palace of  True Pleasure  which is the CountrySeat where  Love  goes to visit  Psyche  and with  that Design I was conducting her that Way when we met the most troublesome Mortal in the World  Pleasure's great Enemy and Foe profess'd  Who still the fondest Lovers does molest  Who o'er the Passions bears impetuous Sway  And with  Love's soft Desires  can't away  Numbers infatuated swell his Train  Charm'd with his empty Maxims to their Pain  Which all our Pleasures criminal esteem  And the least Liberties reproachful deem  This numerous Company which attended him were very much out of Order being all sickly Women who cou'd not keep up with him without great Difficulties  Love  which has taken entire Possession of all the Faculties of their Soul makes them hourly languish and pine away till they are as lean as Skeletons whilst their dying Eyes betray their Hearts and make it visible to every one that the  little God  in spite of all their Resistance maintains his Empire there  This Mortal in one Word was  Honour  and was accompany'd with  Shamefacedness  of whom I can give you no tolerable Description because she has always a Vail over her Face and will not discover herself to any one These two then  having stopt  Zelinda  said a Thousand sine Things to her which seem'd very ridiculous to me but were not esteem'd so by  Zelinda  for assoon as she heard them she resolved to be advised by them at which new Way of Behaviour I was very much astonish'd and immediately cry'd out  Mourn mourn my Eyes mourn your unhappy Fate  Mourn your Disgrace as unforeseen as great  Your Sight  Zelinda  will no longer bear  But has resum'd her Heart and leaves you to despair  If you are blest when in her Eyes you look  If Pleasure in her Company you took  Weep weep my Eyes with Floods of Tears run o'er  Those happy Days you never will see more  Nevertheless I conjured  Love  to use his utmost Endeavours to recall her and he took so much Pains therein that at last he succeeded and we pursued our Journey to the Palace of  True Pleasure  We were not very far from thence when we met with  Respect  and  Precaution  but  Respect  no longer look'd so grave and austere on the contrary he had a very gallant and gracefull Air and his Countenance was full of Smiles  Neither did  Precaution  stand so much upon Ceremonies and  Respect  said to Us with a Smile  Go perfect Lovers go feast ev'ry Sense  And of your Loves reap the sweet Recompence  My Presence now is of no Use to you  I've with your secret Pleasures nought to do  This said he embraced me and left me and he was but just gone when I saw a very handsome Woman stark naked running to Us very swift with her Hair hanging all over her Face before and quite bald behind There were several Persons there some of which quite neglected her and the others ran after her very faintheartedly notwithstanding which they all seemed very much vexed at their having suffered her to pass by them Hereupon  Love  assoon as he saw her told me that it was  Opportunity  and that she only had Interest enough to procure me Entrance into the Palace of  True Pleasure  wherefore I must not let her escape me because one cou'd not be certain ever to find her again In Obedience to his Advice therefore I ran to meet her and stopt her and she brought  Zelinda  to a Resolution of going into the Palace where we at last arrived with the greatest Satisfaction in the World for it is actually a most enchanting Place  There an eternal Spring is seen  And th' azure Sky is still serene  A Thousand Roses hourly blow  Each Moment does fresh Wonders show  The Trees with Fruit o'erloaden stand  And seem to court the Gath'rer's Hand  Each Field is dress'd in lively Green  Around a thousand Caves are seen  With Bows entwin'd all shaded o'er  Lest prying Eyes shou'd ought explore  Where Lovers pass each gladsome Day  In am'rous Sports and wanton Play  These lonesome Caves Time out of Mind  Have sacred been to  Love  we find  Nature  herself the Branches wove  The kind Receptacles of  Love  Whereall the little feather'd Quire  Pleas'd with their Mates in Pairs retire  And make the Hills and Dales around  With Love inspiring Songs resound  And others to excite the  Love  Themselves the  pleasing Lesson  prove  A Thousand little Riv'lets there  With their soft Murmurs fill the Air  Whilst kindly the still Nights conspire  To add fresh Fuel to  Love'  s Fire  There Lovers ne'er are heard complain  Of their Fair's Rigour or Disdain  But after many Troubles past  Joys ev'n beyond their Wishes taste  Why say I more since all that e'er  This World produced or Great or Fair  Have there  Love  's pleasing Passion try'd  And in their Lovers Arms have dy'd  I must own to You that one is very happy in that Place as for my Part when I consider'd that I was arrived at the Height of all my Wishes I thought I cou'd never be sufficiently satisfy'd with my good Fortune but my Happiness was too great to be lasting accordingly I soon saw the End of it as you will observe But some Days before as I was walking I met with a Maiden who was but homely but who was nevertheless very affected and never satisfy'd with any Thing She has no settled Abode because she takes no Care to provide herself of any one even the most agreeable Things being irksome to her her Name is  Coldness  She has a great Power in the  Isle  of  Love  for they who will hearken to her Counsel soon leave it without any Trouble or Regret for she conducts them to the Bay of  Disgust  where there are but too many Vessels ready to carry one away I saw several who went along with her but I thought her so homely and so unreasonable that  I wou'd not stay one Moment with her but return'd to the Palace of  True Pleasure  where some Days after I met with a Misfortune which still makes a deep Impression upon me and which I never expect to see an End of  One Morning in the Midst of all my Pleasures I saw a Man who came saucily to interrupt them his Mien was majestick and independent and his Look haughty and by his Eyes and the whole Air of his Face one might see that he was one that was absolute and knew not what it was to obey In a Word it was  Destiny  whose Decrees are irrevocable who forced  Zelinda  from my Arms All my Efforts to detain her were in vain he took her away and carried her I know not whither for I have not been able to hear of her since  Hereupon I immediately left the Palace of  True Pleasure  which seem'd disagreeable to me since  Zelinda  was no longer there and retired to the Place where I now am and where I believe I shall pass those few remaining Days which my Sorrows will allow me I am here upon the Top of a Mountain call'd the  Desart of Remembrance  its Solitude is very agreeable but what is very vexatious is that the Place is so high that it overlooks the whole  Island of Love  insomuch that one has always one's Misfortune before one's Eyes  and can't help seeing the Places through which one has pass'd and this it is that makes me miserable for which Way soever I turn I find always some Objects which recall my past Happiness to my Remembrance  I have now languish'd here for some Time and at last consider'd that you wou'd have some Reason to complain of me dear  Bellamour  if I did not let you hear from me before my Death Farewell mourn my Misfortune perhaps you may one Day stand in need of the same Consolation  FINIS  A MAP OF THE ISLAND of MARRIAGE  THE Country which I am going to describe to you is an Island of a vast Extent and indisputably the most populous of any Country in the Universe There is no Possibility of entering it but in Couples a Man and a Woman whence it happens that there is always an equal Number of both Sexes therein For no sooner has any one set his Foot in it but there is a strong Guard placed continually at the Mouths of the Harbours which prevents all Persons whatsoever from stirring from thence but on Condition of having their Partners carried to the Grave and being themselves transported to the  Peninsula  of  Widowhood  which is at one of the Ends of the Island  Nor is this Precaution needless for were it not for these Guards this Island as populous as it is would soon be a meer Desert for notwithstanding Thousands of Strangers are flocking thither every Day from all Parts being induced thereunto by the Spirit of Curiosity the first Ruin of Mankind it is very certain that most of the Inhabitants would soon swarm out again by Millions did not these numerous Guards render it impracticable  There is no Way to arrive at this vast Region but by two Ports the one whereof is called  Interest  and the other  Love  The first of these is a  trading Port  full of immense Riches where  Fathers  and  Mothers  keep a  perpetual Fair  to  put off  their  Daughters  who are set out for Sale in their Warehouses and are disposed of for good round Sums in ready Money But there is one Thing very particular in the Way of trading of these Gentry for whereas other Dealers expect Money in Return for their Goods these give a handsome Price to those who will take their Merchandize off their Hands The Port of  Interest  is  open  on all Sides and one may enter it with any Wind  The other is a most agreeable Port abounding with all imaginable Pleasures The People live there in a perpetual Spring and the Trees which are ever green are always full of Birds which  make the Air resound with their Love inspiring Harmony The only Wind that carries into this Port is a gentle Gale called  Sighs  and one always enters therein with Delight but very often before one can get in there arises  sudden Hurricanes  which come from the high Mountain of  Parents  drive the Vessels back into open Sea and prevent their putting into Port Nevertheless when the abovementioned Gale is good and perseveres constantly in blowing from the Region of  Sighs  it seldom fails of getting the better of  these Hurricanes  and bringing Passengers safe into Harbour  When one comes first within Sight of this Island and takes a View of it afar off before one's entering the Port nothing can seem either more inviting or more agreeable One is entertain'd on all Sides with enchanting Prospects that form beautiful Landskips to distant Beholders and deceive the Eye most egregiously but no sooner has one once set Foot ashore but in Proportion as one advances up into the Country one perceives that those Plains which seemed before when at a Distance to be covered with a lively Verdure to be enamelled with Flowers and to flourish with all the Beauties of the jolly Spring are overspread with Briars and Thorns and full of dark and melancholly Vales divided by Torrents and  Precipices abounding with intricate and perplexing Roads that are crossed by Morasses which render them unpassable One finds also that those beautiful rising Grounds which one fancied covered with little verdant Groves are nothing but Heaps of steep Rocks between the mournful Cypresses which overshade them besides which they are full of wild Beasts Dragons and Serpents  Thus 'tis evident that this Island affords two very different Prospects one which is very agreeable to those who have not yet set Foot thereon and only view it at a Distance and another which is highly disagreeable to those who have run themselves wilfully into that Confinement and who are no sooner inthralled therein but they offer up their most ardent Vows for that dear Liberty which they have given up so imprudently insomuch that it is just the same with them as with the Goldfinch and the Cage  How sweet to warble in a Cage  And with soft Notes our Cares t'asswage  All's there provided at our Need  Pure limpid Stream good wholesome Seed  A kind She too with whom to play  And sing and sport the Hours away  Thus said a Goldfinch blithe when he  Incag'd a Linnet once did see  Himself mean while at Liberty  With chearful Note and joyous Sound  Who made his Prison Walls resound  So  Damon  when one Day he 'spy'd  A blooming Virgin Nature's Pride  With Extasy and Rapture cry'd  Thrice happy I beyond Mankind  Were I but to that Fair One join'd  In an undissoluble Tye  With her to live with her to die  But neither Cage nor Marriage State  E'er shew their Evils 'till too late  Nor Birds nor Men find out the Cheat  'Till they are in and past Retreat  O you who burn with am'rous Fire  Wou'd you still keep alive Desire  And add fresh Fuel to the Flame  Still love but never wed the Dame  The Inhabitants of this Island are at perpetual War with those of the  Isle  of  Amathontis  or of  Lovers  which lies very near them I shall describe in the Sequel after what Manner their Wars are carried on but first it will be necessary to give a Description of the different Inhabitants of the  Isle  of  Marriage  Towards the  East  and inclining a little to the  South  one may see another  Island  separated by a great Arm of the Sea which holds no Manner of Correspondence with out  Isle  it is called  Polygamy  The  Mahometans  have usurped to themselves the Possession thereof and our rigid Laws forbid our so much as touching thereat on the most severe Penalties  Not but that there have sometimes been Travellers who have been so curious as to take a Trip thither either out of a Frolick or out of Love and have obtained Admittance there by some Stratagem But nevertheless they have not been able to effect this without embroiling themselves with the Courts of Justice and unless one has as much Gold to throw away as my Lord  Md  one runs the Hazzard of taking a Voyage with Count  Cahoon  to the  ChequerInn  in  NewgateStreet  The  Mahometans  then are left in peaceable Possession of the  Isle  of  Polygamy  and they have accordingly caused the following Verses to be cut in Golden Letters upon a Marble which is placed at the Head of the Pier of their Harbour  To satisfy Love's raging Flames  We  Mussulmans  wed twenty Dames  Although we own the strongest He  More than enough will find  one  She  But this with us a Rule we make  'Tis not too much a  Score  to take  So that among them we can find  One Wife  that's  gen'rous just  and  kind  The Island of  Marriage  is divided into five Provinces which have each of them a Capital City and several little Towns dependent thereon Four of these Provinces extend themselves along the four Sea Coasts but the largest which is chiefly peopled by the Colonies that flock thither from the other four is in the Center of the Island the Government whereof it has usurped through the prodigious Number of its Inhabitants  The four Provinces which lye along the Sea Coasts are inhabited by the  Discreet  the  Illmatched  the  IllatEase  and the  Jealous  The Head Province which is in the Middle is the famous  Cuckoldshire  whose Capital is the wellknown  Hornborough  But besides these five Provinces there are likewise two  Peninsulas  the one of  Widowhood  and the other of  Divorce  which have taken up two Necks of Land at two Ends of this Island  The Province of the  Discreet  who were formerly called the  Faithful  extends itself along the whole  Eastern Coast  Its Capital City is called  Sophia  its Buildings are modest and regular its Fortifications good and capable of making a resolute Defence it is water'd by  Chastity  which is a River whose pure Stream flows softly and without Noise although in its Course it is enlarged by the Waters of four Rivulets called  Piety Austerity Morality  and  Vigilance  These have nothing agreeable in them because they only run in Meanders and their Sides are every where covered with Briars and Thickets which prevent the Incursions of the Scouts of  Amathontis  who might otherwise attempt to land there  The Governour of this City is  Prince Integrity  and my Lord  Honour  is the Civil Magistrate their Churches are always open they live there with Frugality and enjoy no Pleasures but what are innocent The Publick Walks where they take the Air are all planted with  Linden  Trees that are sprung from those into which  Baucis  and  Philemon  were changed and all their Fences are Pallisadoes of  Laurel  sprung from the  chast Daphne  Nevertheless as delightful and well governed as this City is one can scarcely imagine how very few Inhabitants there are therein and were it not for the  Prudes  who have found the Means to get Admittance into it under the borrowed Mask of Virtue this Province would be almost a Desart  These  Prudes  then possess the largest Part of this City and inhabit a Quarter which is separated from the others by the  Obscure  a little River overshaded with Trees which shield it from the Beams of the Sun and disembogues itself into the  Black Sea  Their Houses on the Outside are not to be distinguished from those of the  Discreet  but when my Lord  Honour  goes from Time to Time and makes a narrow Inspection into the Inside of their Tenements he finds so vast a Difference between their outward Appearance and their Management within Doors that he is often forced to banish them and to send large Colonies of them to people the Head Province  The Metropolis being so poorly inhabited it may be well thought that the CountryTowns and Villages are yet worse In effect one meets only with a few scattered up and down and almost without Inhabitants and even these are of such a churlish untractable Temper that a Passenger is hard put to it to find a Lodging  Although those who are really  discreet  are  haughty  and  reserved  they behave themselves with yet less Haughtiness than the  Prudes  there are no People in the World who extol their own Merit to such a Degree as they or make such a Noise about their Virtue insomuch that they treat all  their Neighbours with the utmost Contempt But although they affect to seem wonderfully intrepid and to be eager for the Combat they often prove not to be so brave as they would be thought by their Discourse and the  Amathontins  seldom attempt to invade their Territories without making considerable Havock among them  Even amongst the real  Discreet  one may find two different Sorts one of these are so through a Principle of Honour and are always as chearful as they are invincible but there are others whose Chastity is more owing to their Vanity than their Virtue these have always a sullen Gravity in their Looks which sufficiently demonstrates that they are not at all pleased with their Condition  As little inhabited as the Country is and as severe as the Laws of their Government are it does not prevent some and those even of the  most Discreet  from removing daily into the Head Province for in short Virtue as well as the Mind grows weary of too intense an Application to one Point and is apt to abate of its first Severity but those who stay behind look upon these Deserters with Contempt for which Reason they have set up the following Inscription over the Front of their principal Gate  Ye virtuous Fair our Island's Pride  Whose sterling Honour often try'd  Has always made a brave Defence  Hither without Distrust repair  Here you may live secure from Fear  Arm'd Capapee with Innocence  What tho' we are in Number few  We're all intrepid staunch and true  Nor Treachery nor Ambush dread  Nor need we 'gainst our Honour's Foes  Implore the feeble Aid of Those  Who basely from our Colours fled  On the opposite Side of the Island that is on the  Western Coast  is the whimsical and unaccountable Province of the  Illmatch'd  The Metropolis of this Province is called the  Old Town  None of the Buildings of this City have any Conformity one with the other nor is there any Manner of Symmetry observed therein insomuch that one may often see a great Gate to a small House and a diminitive Wicket to a spacious Palace It is watered by two Rivers one whereof is called the  Fantasque  and the other the  Clandestine  The one is a River consisting wholly of Cascades and hurrying every Moment with Violence down Precipices and the other a rapid Torrent which being ashamed of showing itself runs  impetuously under Ground but notwithstanding the Care it takes to hide its Course cannot prevent its being discovered by a hollow Noise it makes in flowing  As soon as one has set Foot within the Gates of this City one hears nothing but the Cries and Complaints of Children whom either an old Mother has sacrificed to a young Rake or whom an old Debauchee has given up as Victims to a young Coquet Here the Master of a Family marries his CookMaid and there an old Beldame of Quality takes to Husband her  Valet de Chambre  and solemnizes in her own Chapel a Ceremony which serves only to add fresh Shame to her Licentiousness  At the Gates of this City grows that famous Wood mentioned by the bantering Doctor in the Play The Trees he says of this Wood bear the Heads of all Sorts of Iron Tools and the Earth underneath produces proper Handles wherewith to fit them up but it often happens that when the Iron is at full Growth and falls instead of meeting with a Handle that would be proper for it it drops upon one that matches it most preposterously For Instance the Head of a Scythe falls upon the Handle of a Pike the Head of a Halberd upon the Helve of a Hatchet and so of all  the rest insomuch that not one of them meets with a Handle suitable to its Purpose  It is just the same Case with those who make Matches so disproportionable either for Age or Quality that they only render themselves a Laughing Stock to every one who hears thereof I would have all Persons therefore remember this as an infallible Truth  On equal Hinges turns the Marriage State  No Happiness therein's allowed by Fate  Two great a Disproportion if there be  In Fortune Humour Age or Quality  For although it is a very common Saying and almost grown into a Proverb  That Love will unite the most distant Extreams in its Center  it is only in LoveAffairs that this Union must be understood to be effected with Pleasure but when the indissoluble Tye of Matrimony is in the Case the Proverb will be found no longer to hold good  Upon the  Southern Coast  of this Island is the Province of the  IllatEase  whose Capital City is  ShortAllowance  under the Command of Colonel  HardFare  The Inhabitants of this Country are melancholly and fretful the Houses are but Cottages which the Want of BellyTimber unfurnishes by little and little the Kitchens all lye  open to the  NorthWind  and the People therein have little else to do but to blow their Fingers The City is watered by  Famine  a sorry little Brook which only runs murmuring over a Parcel of FlintStones and does not afford the smallest little Fish the barren Fields yield nothing but Straw and the Vines nought but sower and distasteful Grapes  Notwithstanding this miserable Want of necessary Provision most Part of the Inhabitants and especially the Women will cheat their Bellies of the little they can afford to bestow it upon a deceitful Dress which conceals their inward Necessities under a Disguise of an easy Outside But this Desire of Finery beyond what they can afford and the Cries of a halfstarved Belly makes these Inhabitants leave this miserable Country with Pleasure and flock in large Colonies to People the Head Province and endeavour to help the Barrenness of their Lands by the kindly Showers of Gold that fall from the Pockets of their Lovers  Gallants who study Night and Day  To gain fresh Conquests o'er the Fair  The coyest she will fall a Prey  When her own Wants first lay the Snare  On the  Northern Coast  of the  Isle of Marriage  lies the Province of the  Jealous  whose Capital City is situated on the Middle of Mount  Chimaera  just in that Part which the Antients said was inhabited by  Bulls  and  Goats  the Top being possessed by Lions and the Bottom by Serpents which gave Rise to the Fable of its being an Animal composed of three Natures But the Poets who were wretched Geographers have mistaken its Situation since it is certainly in this Province that Mount  Chimaera  is situated  The Metropolis of the  Jealous  is call'd  False Belief  it is water'd by  Anxiety  which is a River whose deep yellow Stream serves the Inhabitants as a deceitful and fallacious LookingGlass and fills their Heads with  horned  Visions by representing Things to them in a quite different Manner from what they are in Reality But besides the delusive Nature of the Water of this River the Inhabitants in Imitation of the  Antojos  amongst the  Spaniards  never stir a Step without wearing upon their Noses  great  Spectacles made of  magnifying  Glass which magnifies all Objects to that Degree that the smallest Fly seems to them like an Elephant and every Atom appears to be a Pair of  large BrowAntlers  These People are the most Savage of any in the whole Island and their Country is the most rugged  and unpassable It is wholly overspread with steep Mountains cover'd with impenetrable Woods gloomy Vales and barren Plains wherefore none but the Native Inhabitants can dwell therein neither would the  Jealous  suffer them if they cou'd and much less the  Amathontins  than any others because they are firmly persuaded that they find some Means or other to accomplish their Designs every where  The Capital City altho' situated on the Side of a Hill stands nevertheless in a very obscure Place and is overshadowed with Mountains on every Side There is no Way to it but by narrow difficult Roads full of watchful Centinals whose Eyes are never both closed at one Time but the one wakes while the other sleeps They caused formerly the following Inscription to be set up upon a high Post that was erected for that Purpose beyond the  Glacis  of their Fortifications  Deceivers Sly Gallants away  This is no Place for you to stay  Yourselves who value on base Arts  To circumvent weak Women's Hearts  This City is forbidden Ground  March off nor in these Parts be found  You may indeed the  Outworks  view  But all  within's  forbidden you  The  Amathontis  being nettled at the presumptuous Confidence of these Verses march'd thither one Night blotted them out and substituted these following in their Room  When once two Hearts which burn with mutual Fires  With prudent Care conceal their fierce Desires  The subtlest He no easy Task will find  To part that Pair whom ardent Love has join'd  In vain a Fool may watch them up and down  He'll scratch his  Horns  at last and  sighing  own  When  Wife  and  Spark  are firm combin'd to gull you  Do what you please you'll find yourself their  Cully  The Streets of this City are extreamly lightsome and very strait to the End that one may be able to have a clear View of all that is transacted therein from one End to the other but the Houses are extreamly dark having but few Windows and those very small and cross barr'd The Inhabitants are mighty grave and hold very little Correspondence with their Neighbours  Although the City be pretty Populous one sees very few Folks in the Streets and the Husbands beat the TatToo very early to call their Wives  home in good Time before the Dusk of the Evening exposes them to any Surprize They are an odd sort of Mortals they are perpetually upon Thorns and one may see them hurry out and return in again every Minute with the utmost Abruptness their Eyes staring all the while and their Ears pricked up with the utmost Attention and Anguish  They apply to themselves every Word that is spoken and tremble at the Sight of a Man of Gallantry as much as a Dove at the Sight of a Hawk Then it is that they are very diverting by the Ridiculousness and Folly of their Uneasiness which is so far from being of any Service to them that they themselves contribute most to the Success of their Enemies Affairs by their perpetual teazing and provoking those whom they would defend from their Attacks Since it is certain that nothing contributes more to the Conquest of a Gallant than the Reasons one gives a Wife to revenge herself of one's ill Usage and I have known those whose Pleasure has received a more exquisite Relish by the extravagant Humours and Caprices of a jealous Cuckold  'Tis said that one Day a pretty large Colony of these  jealous  Husbands were obliged to remove all together into the Head Province and that by a very whimsical and merry Accident An  Amathontin  who had found Means to steal into their Quarters took it in his Head to post up the following Verses in the principal Square of the City  Cease  jealous Fools  your Storming cease  Which does but your own Woes increase  And add fresh Fuel to our Fires  To teaze your Spouses Night and Day  Believe me is the ready Way  To make them yield to loose Desires  Your unkind Blows to tender Wives  Your causless Brawls and restless Lives  In everlasting Discord spent  Will to yourselves most fatal prove  Will kindle Hate instead of Love  And forward what you'd most prevent  Hereupon one of the Inhabitants who having a Flea in his Ear happened to rise earlier than the Rest and had some Business in that Square went thither found these Verses tore them down that Instant hurried Home directly with all Speed and thresh'd his Wife most enormously This done he handed them about very carefully from Door to Door amongst all his Neighbours who taking each of them the Thing to himself treated his Rib just in the same Manner as the first Coxcomb but notwithstanding all the Vigilance of  these Noodles every one of the Women concerted their Measures so well together that they were fully revenged of them the very Night following insomuch that the next Morning when they awoke all these  jealous Coxcombs  found themselves in  Cuckoldshire  without having ever dreamed of it and were irrecoverably entered upon the Register of the HeadProvince  I have already observed that this City is watered by the River  Anxiety  which is a large River navigable from its very Spring Its Waters have this Property that they deprive one of Sleep it yields no other Fish but  Gudgeons  which the  Amathonlins  often prevail on these  jealous  Gentry to swallow The City is extreamly strong and inaccessible the Walls which are at least as thick as those built by  Semiramis  are surrounded on all Sides by this deep River so that there is no approaching the City but by a Bridge that is laid over the River beyond which is a narrow Causey fortified by six strong Batteries well guarded which lead up to the only Gate there is insomuch that no  Amathontin  can pass but by the Help of some Disguise But as there are no People in the World that are more ingenious than this Nation some of them perpetually find the Means to get into the City which they seldom leave without making a terrible Havock  Having given an Account of the four Nations that inhabit the Sea Coast Order next requires me to mention the Head Province of  Cuckoldshire  and its numerous Inhabitants who by a very just  Antonomasia  have assumed to themselves the Name of  Cuckolds  The Capital of this Province is called  Hornborough  and is at least as large as  London  to which it bears a very great Resemblance but like the ancient  Thebes  it has an Hundred Gates that it may be able to give Entrance to the prodigious Concourse of Newcomers who daily flock thither from all Parts All the World having a Title to a Freedom there from the greatest Emperor to the most Scoundrel Blackguard and as soon as his Spouse pleases the Husband puts in his Claim and enters into Possession in Right of his Wife In short this City and indeed the whole Province has the same Property as the  Sea  and the  Gallows  for it  refuses none  from the  Prince  to the  Beggar  It has been observed indeed by some in Exception to this that there never was  Pope Cardinal Jesuit  nor  Priest  in all this Province I suppose because they don't care for the Company of People of such bad Principles but then to make Amends there have been abundance of Rosycheek'd Protestant Divines especially  Abps Bps  and  dignified Clergymen  against whom no Exception has ever been made they being always very welcome Guests  This City is situated in the Midst of a large and fertile Plain abounding with all the Pleasures and Delicacies that can be wished for in Life the  Pactolus  runs quite through the Midst of it and its fruitful Streams which abound with golden Sand divide it exactly in two My Lord  ReadyMoney  a Grandee of  Spain  and formerly ViceRoy of  Peru  is Governor thereof the  Jupiters  also of the  Treasury  who can convert themselves into  Golden Showers  bear great Sway there it being from their powerful Body that the Magistracy are yearly chose for which Reason they have caused the following Inscription to be set over the Front of their TownHall  Whene'er We Lovers sue in vain  And neither Sighs nor Vows avail  To move the Fair to ease our Pain  The  Golden Key  will never fail  Each Side of the  Pactolus  is divided into two Quarters insomuch that the whole City consists of four Parts inhabited by four Sorts of Citizens who from their different Characters are called by different Names These are the  Contented  the  Frantick  the  Incredulous  and the  Imaginary Cuckolds  The  Contented Cuckolds  dwell in a Quarter which they have named the  Land of Plenty  they are a good Sort of People with whom a Man may do what he will and who withdraw commodiously and without Noise as soon as ever a Lover appears They would be very sorry ever to interrupt the Pleasures of those who do them the Honour to visit their Wives Their Word of Battle is  Let Pleasure be free I consent  This jovial Humour is visible in all their Looks Words and Actions there is nothing to be seen at their Houses but Dancing and Feasting perpetually Operas Balls Masquerades Hunting Matches and Parties of Pleasure of all which they are sure to be Partakers The City is neither fortified with Walls Gates or DrawBridges on their Side amongst them every one lives without Constraint and without Jealousy their only Care being after what Manner they shall divert themselves provided it is at the Expence of the  Amathontins  who are never better pleased than when they are among these good People although they never fail to send them by Degrees to an Hospital in order to make Room for others For Lovers are in one Respect like Fish  the freshest are always the best  And to the End that no Body  may be ignorant of the free and communicative Temper of those Gentry Care has been taken to have these Verses engraven on a large Plate of Gold and to have them set up in the Midst of the principal Square  With us all lead contented Lives  None e'er conceal their soft Desires  But Gallants Husbands and their Wives  Burn openly with mutual Fires  For what does Secresy avail  To guard a buxom Female's Honour  The watchfull'st Husband's Care will fail  When once the loving Fit's upon her  To yield to Fate is then the best  And we the wisest Method follow  We drink we feast we take our Rest  And in Delights and Riches wallow  Ye jealous Fools whose empty Pride  Makes you esteem our Conduct base  Had you but once the Difference try'd  Yourselves you d soon wish in our Place  With Doubts and Fears for ever cross'd  How much less happy Days d'ye pass  And who lives at another's Cost  Is not I m sure the greatest Ass  Over against these  Contented Cuckolds  and on the other Side of a large Brook that parts them  are the  Frantick Cuckolds  who have taken up their Residence in that Quarter of the Town where  Cuckoldom  has erected her  Bedlam  This Quarter which is called the Quarter of the  Pazzi  is inhabited by those Fools who take a Pleasure in publishing their own Shame in making the Courts of Justice ring with their ridiculous Complaints and diverting the Publick with the continual Farce of their Extravagancies All their Recreation is in bedaubing themselves with Filth and giving themselves abundance of Trouble and that at a vast Charge in order to convince the Courts of Justice of their having suffered a Disgrace which they ought rather if possible to endeavour to unknow themselves and with the Fruits of which the honest Lawyers feast themselves very merrily  These extravagant Wretches are divided into two Classes whereof the one have taken up their Quarters in the Hospital of the  Curables  these are such as after a fruitless Clamour which has rendered them for some Time the Talk and Jest of the Town begin to recover their Senses and say that all Things rightly considered taking one Woman with another they still like their own Wives best  The others who are lodged in a different and yet less agreeable Quarter are those  incurable Lunaticks  who under the Direction of a  hornified  Physician ride full Speed to lay their Bones in an AlmsHouse by making themselves a Prey to a senseless Obstinacy and being the continual Bubbles of the Vultures and Harpies of the Law  The Desolation of their Families the Confinement of their Wives the disowning and bastardizing of their own Children with an inexhaustable Fund of LawSuits entailed one upon another are the necessary Consequences of their Frenzy and the Countenance they find as long as they have Money wherewith to feed the hungry Lawyers is what contributes to their Infatuation and compleats their Ruin to all Intents and Purposes  One may see them always in a Fury with their Eyes swelled out of their Heads and their Faces in a Flame running from Attorney to Attorney and from Council to Council hunting for and hiring at a vast Expence false Witnesses who cover all them with Ignominy stopping their Ears against all the good Counsel that is given them and shutting their Eyes against all the Examples of those who have recovered their Senses But of all these mad Wretches none sure was ever more distracted than he over whose Door they pasted up the following Verses  Pinchwife  the maddest of the  horned  Train  Drunk with the Fumes that cloud his empty Brain  Consumes in Law the Income of a Lord  To be allowed a Cuckold on Record  Yet tell him He's a Fool and that the Town  Laugh at his Clamour and denide his Moan  That ev'ry prudent Man in such a Case  Endeavours to keep secret his Disgrace  Go preach to such a Wretch as well you might  Attempt to wash an  Aethiopian  white  On the other Side of the  Pactolus  are the  Imaginary Cuckolds  who believe themselves to be what they are not and the  Incredulous Cuckolds  who are not to be covinced that they are what they really are These are two Sorts of Citizens of very different Tempers the first resolving to be Inhabitants of this City in Spight of all that could be done to prevent them and the others being to the last Degree astonished at their being made free thereof without having any Title to it as they are pleased to flatter themselves The Houses of these Two Sorts of Citizens whose Tempers are so very different are separated from each other by a Rivulet called the  Perverse  whose Waters are so muddy and so thick that the Eye cannot discover what lies at the Bottom  The  Incredulous  are only so because they repose too intire and too implicit a Confidence in whatever their artful Wives endeavour to make them believe they live contented and at Quiet but not like those  contented Ones  in that Quarter called the  Land of Plenty  who both know of give Consent to and pocket up their  Horns  in order to reap their own Benefit from it but by the Means of an indolent Ignorance that keeps them from all Uneasiness  Whilst the Day lasts their whole Employment is to enjoy a sweet and peaceable Repose in the Forest of  Confidence  a Place that is impenetrable by the Rays of the Sun and not within the reach of the Noise of the City The one might in vain beat all their Drums and sound all their Trumpets yet would it never in the least disturb their Ears and the other might shine out with the greatest Lustre and diffuse all his brightest Rays around the Globe to as little Purpose since it would not have the least Effect upon their Eyes Happy they in their peaceful Indolence But more happy still the artful Gipsies who have brought them to such a Pass  There is nothing to be seen in this Quarter but mutual Pleasure and Endearments between the Husbands and Wives the one with an entire Confidence think they can neither find Words obliging  enough or Caresses tender enough to thank their Dears for a Fidelity which they are far from keeping and the subtle Baggages the more they deceive them the more they redouble their Wheedling their Caresses and all Manner of fond and ensnaring Endearments  On the contrary that Quarter which is inhabited by the  Imaginary Cuckolds  differs widely from this in every Particular the People there are morose quarrelfome and unsociable one may observe them always upon their Guard against every Body and both Sexes are equally subject to this Virtigo Nothing there is to be heard but Quarrels and Reproaches the one are perpetually troubled with the  Spleen  and the others with the  Vapours  their very Children fall Sacrifices to this reciprocal Caprice even the most legitimate are looked upon as Bastard Grafts every Thing there is misconstrued and they judge of nothing without Prejudice One cannot so much as set a Foot in the Streets without finding a prodigious Number falling together by the Ears and the honest Man in the Play  The Mock Doctor  who interposed impertinently between the  FaggotMaker  and his Wife in order to bring them to a Reconciliation would have found full Employment  there in meddling between the Bark and the Tree  In short these People are absolutely Incorrigible for although the Goddess of Reason once sent the famous  Moliere  to them from the  Contented Witalls  of the  Land of Plenty  in order to convince them of their Infatuation by drawing an admirable Picture of the Extravagance of their Imaginations he could never succeed in the Cure he had undertaken and their Brains remained as much addled as ever wherefore some Time after they were complimented with the following Verses  When real Ills upon us fall  If not felt they're no Ills at all  Nor do they cause much Grief or Pain  But they whom fancied Ills oppress  Sworn Foes to their own Happiness  Are blest with Health and Wealth in vain  Incurable is their Disease  In vain one strives to give them Ease  Ev'n Remedies themselves offend  And all the fruitless Pains we take  On their sick Brain a Cure to make  Texasperate them only tend  As  Hornborough  although it is of a vast Extent is far from being large enough to contain that prodigious Number of Inhabitants who have actually an incontestable Right to a Freedom there the Country round about swarms with the meaner Sort who leave the City for Courtiers Commissioners of the Treasury and Customs Gentlemen of Estates great Merchants substantial Tradesmen and some Officers of the Army but above all for an infinite Number of  GownMen  whose Profession marks them out for a  HeadPiece  of  HornWork  which they very seldom fail to wear  Having thus given an Account of the whole Body of the Island there remains now only two little Districts to be described which are two Peninsula's that run out into the Sea the one which is on a Neck of Land towards the  North  is the Promontory of  Divorce  and the other which is on another towards the  South  is the Promontory of  Widowhood  The Peninsula of  Divorce  is only separated from the Isle of  Marriage  by a very narrow  Isthmus  through which it is pretty difficult to pass It is called the  Isthmus  of  Corinth  and from thence came the Proverb that every Body is not allowed to go to  Corinth  that is to say that  every Body is not allowed a Passage into the  Peninsula  of  Divorce  The Extravagance of an old Chancellour of a Diocess who was desirous of rendering this Passage more easy induced him formerly to constitute an imprudent filthy and brutal Giant called my Lord  Congress  Superintendant of this  Isthmus  This was a  Curious  and  Shameless Wretch  who in order to remove the Difficulties of this Passage rendered  Impotent  by obliging them to be perform'd in Publick the  Conjugal Efforts  of those Husbands who would have hindered their Wives from removing into this  Peninsula  The Modesty of the Moderns wou'd no longer suffer this filthy Lord to expose the Combatants to this Shame and Infamy wherefore they have cashier'd this ridiculous Superintendant but in Return the artful  Amathontins  have brought into Play another Enchantress who has been introduced under the Name of  Separation  and they have supported her so well that she makes few Attempts without Success  It is she who now peoples the  Peninsula  of  Divorce  because the River  Repudiate  whereby they formerly arrived thither is no longer navigable thus by removing a small Evil which produced a great Good they have introduced a  small Good which does not prevent a great Evil  This little Country has neither Towns nor Villages all the Houses are separated from each other like Hermitages and to take a View of it from the neighbouring Eminencies one wou'd fancy it actually the Abode of some Anchorets But the Solitude and Melancholy of these Desarts is mightily alleviated by the frequent Intercourse of the  Amathontins  who take abundance of Delight therein and find the Means to administer agreeable Consolation to the solitary Inhabitants Above all this is the Place where the Gentlemen of the long Robe gain the most Triumphs for as the Fair Sex cannot get over the Difficulties that obstruct this Passage without the Assistance of those who wear that Robe their first Care is always to provide themselves of a Protector who may remove all Obstacles  The Inhabitants of this Country are not beloved by those in the Isle of  Marriage  but when the latter take upon them to blame their Conduct they have an Answer ready which is as follows  Full happily tho' something late  We're freed from the cursed Marriage State  That Bane and Torment of our Lives  You who've of late put on those Chains  And blame our Conduct count your Gains  When your  new Dears  are grown  meer Wives  A little Patience we beseech  E're you begin to us to preach  And you e're long will surely find  That even they who fare the best  And envy'd are by all the rest  Are far from Blest in their own Mind  Although these  Divorces  are most commonly demanded by the Women the Men sometimes don't fail to take Advantage thereof and several Husbands have even found the Means to provoke their Wives artfully to sue for them and then pretending to oppose it they suffer themselves to be cast like  Ovid  's Mistress who was overcome as he says by her own Treachery This made one of those who had got rid of his Matrimonial Burthen by this Artisice and had obtained a Place in this Solitude have the Picture of a Ship in a Storm drawn in  Fresco  in his Cell and the Pilot calling out to the Sailors to fling over board all the heaviest Luggage in Obedience to which Order one of them takes up his Wife and throws her into the Sea with the following Lines at the Bottom of the Picture  Whilst th' angry Waves run Mountains high  And o'er the shatter'd Vessel break  Throw over board the Sailors cry  Your  heaviest  Goods for all's at Stake  Pleas'd with this Order to comply  I to the Floods commit my Wife  For sure I am that never I  Had  heavier  Goods in all my Life  The other  Peninsula  is that of  Widowhood  which is upon a Promontory that lies towards the  South  and is only separated from the rest of the Island by a very narrow Neck of Land which is wholly taken up by a magnificent  Mausoleum  built after the Model of that of Queen  Artemisa  insomuch that there is no passing for any one from the Isle of  Marriage  to the District of  Widowhood  but through this Tomb by the Means of a subterraneous Vault that is contrived under it  The Inhabitants always make their Entrance there in Mourning and they live there in Joy and Pleasure the Air of this Country which every one there breaths with Freedom being the most consolatory in the World Nevertheless all the Inhabitants are not able to relish it with Pleasure and Satisfaction for there comes a Wind from the Coast of a certain little Province of the Island called  Binubia  whose malignant Atoms  cause  new Itchings  which create such Uneasiness as those that are troubled therewith believe they can have no Cure for without going to  Binubia  and breathing the Air of that Place  One cannot reenter the Island of  Marriage  but by this Coast which makes a little separate Province and has even some particular Laws which are not observed in the other Provinces  In order to set sail for this little Country of  Binubia  the Inhabitants of the Peninsula of  Widowhood  must embark at a certain little Port which has taken its Name from the celebrated  Ephesian  Matron because it was there she took shipping with her Soldier in order to set sail for  Binubia  Nevertheless several Persons have given it the Name of  Evil Counsel  although the Marble that is at the Foot of an old Statue which is placed there gives very  good Counsel  in the following Verses which are to be seen thereon  Why will you part with that dear Liberty  Which you've so sigh'd for and so dearly bought  Why run again into that Slavery  Whence fortunately you by Death was brought  From Shipwrack once escap'd the prudent Man  When he's arriv'd safe at his wish'd for Port  Tempts he the Dangers of the Sea again  To make himself of Winds and Waves the Sport  And on the other Side of the Marble one may read these other Verses  Whoe'er once freed from Marriage Chain  Hamper themselves therein again  Incorrigible write them down  A Title they can't well disown  And I with all my Soul consent  To doom them to the Punishment  Those harden'd  Culprits  must expect  Whom Mercy shewn will not affect  'Tis impossible to imagine with what violent Fits of Laughter what cutting Raillery the Inhabitants of  Widowhood  banter those who set out for  Binubia  they hire an infinite Number of Hawkers who are perpetually hollowing in their Ears  A Warning to all old Widows who marry second Husbands The lamentable History and Downfall of the old Widower who married his Cookmaid come a Halfpenny a Piece a Halfpenny a Piece  and a Thousand other such biting Jests in Derision to those who have not the Resolution to keep themselves in that happy State which perhaps they have ardently wish'd for a hundred Times before the happy Minute of their Deliverance came  But the People of  Binubia  who have often been themselves the first to rally those whom they have afterwards follow'd give once for all the following Answer to those who stay behind  Patience too soon your Bliss you boast  Perhaps you count without your Host  Already once the Fool you've play'd  And may again you're not yet dead  And perhaps they are not very much in the Wrong when they answer them in this Manner for it frequently happens that we fall into that very same Error for which we have been the first to reprehend others and most Part of the Inhabitants of  Binubia  did not engage in second Marriages till after they had often endeavoured to dissuade others from it  Binubia  is a little City whose Buildings are for the most Part old and almost ready to fall only the Walls are new whitewash'd new plaister'd up and new painted according to Art to hide all Defects Every Thing there has a melancholy and mournful Aspect and as almost every Match there has been made by the Influence of SelfInterest all there are intent upon managing their Affairs to their own private Advantage  at the Expence of their Partner whom they flatter themselves with the Hopes of surviving Accordingly the very best Employment of any in this Country is to follow the Law in order to take Advantage of the innumerable LawSuits which are daily caused by second Marriages  Nothing is to be heard there but the Complaints and mournful Lamentations of Children by a first Marriage who have been robb'd and cheated of their Right to inrich those by a second with endless Enquiries into Titles to Estates to which the Lawyers at last become the Principal Heirs and Disputes about Guardians Accounts and false Inventories In short every Thing there is in Trouble and Confusion and the Pettyfoggers have not in the World such another fruitful Nursery of LawSuits  Having now given you an Account of all the different People that inhabit the Island of  Marriage  viz the  Discreet  the  Illmatch'd  the  IllatEase  the  Jealous  the  Cuckolds  the  Binubians  the  Divorced  and the Inhabitants of  Widowhood  nothing remains but to give likewise some Description of their Enemies the  Amathontins  and the perpetual Wars they have with them  I have already observed that  Amathontis  or the Island of  Lovers  is not far distant from the Isle of  Marriage  and indeed it is so near that the  Amathontins  are every Moment invading them in prodigious Numbers and never fail making terrible Havock amongst them insomuch that they are very seldom driven out again when they have once got Footing there One Province or other is always warmly engaged with them especially  Cuckoldshire  which is overrun with their Multitudes and the others are not free from them  Their Manner of waging War is very pleasant for it is not in Incursions that make a great Noise and Bustle in the World that they place their chief Hope and Dependence no they do their Business much better by introducing themselves without Clamour by getting Footing privately and by gaining over to their Interest all the most considerable Persons in the Country But they have no sooner made a Lodgment any where but they know how to maintain themselves therein and the fewer they march in Company the more formidable they are  It is not then with open Force that they attack the Enemy whom they design to  overthrow  one hears neither Trumpet sound nor Drum beat when they march either to  storm  a  Fort  or to  give Battle  all is done without Noise  Advances  are all made either by Intrenchment or by Sap and their  Battles  are all reduced to  single Combat  every Man  singling out the Enemy  with whom he chooses to encounter  As for their Weapons  Volleys of Sighs  are their only  SmallArms Languishing  and  dying Eyes  their only  Swords  and the  softest  and  most tender Expressions  their  most dangerous Artillery  They have indeed a Kind of  Short Stilletto  which they  always  carry  about them conceal'd  and with which they sometimes give  dangerous Stabs  but this is never but when they are  very close  and  very warmly engaged  and have the  Enemy down and at a Disadvantage  for which Reason some Persons will scarcely allow it to be a  fair Weapon  but be that as it will it is well known that  few  of the  Enemy  are  afraid  of its  most home Thrusts  Their  greatest Valour  then consists only in their  Submission  and  Complaisance  to their Enemies their  Glory  is wholly confin'd to  loading  them with their  own Spoils  and their most  compleat Victory  is in  expiring  between the  Arms  of the  conquer'd Enemy  in short the  more secret  their  Triumphs  are the  greater Pleasure  they  take  in them  By this Conduct and provided the  Sinews of War  are  not wanting  there is nothing which an  Amathontin  cannot effect  No Fortifications  are  Proof  against their  Cannon  nor is there any  Fort  which will not  surrender  if they  persevere  in their  Attacks  This made them once put the following Inscription upon a  Quiver  which they dedicated to the  God of Love  In th' Island which from  Marriage  takes its Name  Especially amongst the  Jealous  Sands  The watchfull'st haughtiest and descreetest Dame  With Difficuly can escape our Hands  Yet do we never open War declare  We are a kind of subtle Privateers  And when we find a tender hearted Fair  With all her num'rous Train of Hopes and Fears  Let  Argus  all his Hundred Eyes employ  Still will we be the Masters of the Field  In Spight of him we'll seize the killing Joy  And force the coyest stubborn'st She to yield  Neither do they often fail of being as good as their Words These  Amathontins  are an agreeable free goodhumoured generous and disinterested People insomuch that instead of ravaging and amassing Spoils in the Country of  Marriage  they spend at such a Rate that they very often enrich those they have  overthrown  and  those who have connived at their getting any Footing in the Country  But whoever would attempt to describe all the Wiles and all the Stratagems whereof this artful Nation makes use of in order to introduce themselves make a Lodgment and gain a compleat Victory would be obliged to write Millions of Volumes Not but that there are among them an infinite Number of  Inconstants Indiscreet Ones  and  Impostors  one may hear Complaints made of them every Day But notwithstanding all these Complaints there would be no living without them and half their Enemies would be in a very sad Condition if they should cease to make War upon them  'Tis impossible to conceive into what a good Humour the Reading of this agreeable Piece put the whole Company by its humerous Description of the Isle of  Marriage  All owned it to be exquisitely imagined and to be carried on with the nicest Judgment at last it brought into our Minds the celebrated  Map  of  Tender  in the Romance of  Clelia  which formerly was highly extoll'd but every one agreed that this had several Beauties and a Delicacy and Turn which the other was far from coming up to  Every one then called to Remembrance those Places which had made the most lively Impression  upon their Imagination but of all the Parts of the Island they always returned again to  Hornborough  through a certain natural Inclination which seems to draw all the World thither either to make Part of its Inhabitants or to laugh at them and very often for both For the Citizens of this vast City have this merry Faculty belonging to them that they generally ridicule one another some to divert Peoples Thoughts from being fixed upon them and others to comfort themselves for their own Disgrace  At last  Melinda  one of the three Ladies who were with us and who has a delicate and just Way of thinking and expressing herself turned about to me and asked me If I could give any Reason why People were fond of having it thought that the  Horned Society  are the Chief and most numerous Part of the Inhabitanes of this vast Country  You ask me a Question Madam said I to which it is not very difficult to find an Answer for as soon as you reflect that this formidable Society consists for the most Part of Men who are  haughty unsociable morose snappish illnatured uncomplaisant uneasy  in their Circumstances and perpetually employed about every Thing that is the  most unlikely  to render a Man  gallant  and  agreeable  you will find more Reasons than one for what you desire to know  These few Words opened us a large Field of Scandal and gave us full Scope to take a general Review of some Hundreds of our Acquaintance which we accordingly did afterwards Time not then permitting by Reason Dinner was ready Wherefore we adjourned our Satire 'till Afternoon at the joint Invitation of  Ceres Bacchus  and our own Appetites which were by this Time pretty sharp set What passed afterwards may possibly prove the Entertainment of another Day if this meets with a favourable Acceptance from the Town  FINIS  THE BATCHELOR's ESTIMATE OF THE EXPENCES OF A Married Life In a LETTER to a FRIEND Being an Answer to a

Church Window and Poor's Taxes Payments to Rector Reader and Lecturer Water TrophyMoney Militia Lamp Scavengers Watch Constable  c  all which I am now free from must be then paid which cannot amount to less than    Expences of Tea Coffee Chocolate Sugar Spirits and fresh Supply of China yearly         l s d  Brought forward    To my BedMaker I pay about s a Year when married I must keep two MaidServants and a Man whose Wages and the Man's Livery must at least come to l a Year so that here is an extraordinary Expence of    Coach Watermen and ChairHire for my Wife to make Visits take the Air to see Plays  c  at a reasonable and yearly Computation    Her Expences at those Diversions    I now seldom go to see above a Play in a Season I must in Complaisance to my Wife sometimes wait on her and partake of those Entertainments for I do not think it proper she should go alone which I will moderately compute at         l s d  Brought forward    It costs me now about s a Year in Coals I am sure it must then cost me l so that here is another yearly Increase of Expence    The same of Candles in Proportion    My Wife's necessary wearing Apparel         Having a Family of my own I shall diminish little or nothing else out of the Expences of my Dinners as to the Evening Expences you know married Men go abroad as often at that Time as Batchelors and I won't promise to be more Uxorious than my Neighbours so that instead of l a Year at the most it now costs me in Dinners I shall have the following Bills to pay Yearly  viz     l s d  From the former Calculation    The Butcher    Poulterer         l s d  Brought forward    The Fishmonger    HerbWoman    Oylman    Baker    Brewer    Grocer    Confectioner    Perfumer    Cheesemonger    Wine Cider  c  at a moderate Computation    The Fruiterer    The MilkWoman    Salt SmallCoal RottenStone BrickDust Sand FullersEarth Sope Matches Vinegar Ashes ScouringPaper OatMeal Whiteing and many other little Ingredients in Housekeeping I am ignorant of         l s d  Brought forward    So that deducting thereout the l being the Charge of my Dinners there will be a necessary additional Matrimonial Expence in Housekeeping    If my Wife pleases me as I do not doubt but your Relation will I know my own Temper so well in that Respect that I shall be often making her Presents of either Rings Jewels SnuffBoxes Watch Tweezers some KnickKnacks and Things of that Nature in which one Year with another I am sure I shall expend    The Expences of the Buyingin and a Succession of Parrots LapDogs CanaryBirds  c         l s d  Brought forward    Then comes an Article I least wish for but happens in most Families my Wife's Servants the Expences of Doctor and Apothecary and though it is accidental yet one Year with another cannot come short of    As for Children I dare say our Attempts in that Respect will not prove fruitless we may reasonably expect one in every two Years if not oftner but it shall not be my Fault if it does not     The Expence of Lyingin ChildbedLinnen Midwife Nurses Cawdles Baskets Cradle Christenings Blankets Pinns Clouts  c  must at least be l so that if it should happen once in two Years it may be reckoned a yearly Expence of         l s d  Brought forward    Nursing Maintaining Education Cloaths Schooling of our Children even in their Infancy and which must be increased as they advance in Years besides their Fortunes which must be saved or got to the no small Care Toil and Fatigue of the Parent at a randam Calculation and vastly less than I am satisfied it will be    Pew in the Church    Washing my Wife's and the Family Linnen    Repairs of Furniture new Brooms Mops Brushes and Rubbers Matts Carpetts Altering Exchange and Repairs of Furniture         The Furniture of my House and TableLinnen cannot come short of l which with l for Plate without which being so moderate a Quantity I dare say my Wife nor indeed should I myself be satisfied will lie dead daily decrease in its Value and bring me in no Income I must therefore reckon my Wife's Fortune in point of its bringing me in a Yearly Income at no more than l  Now Sir as you have been a HouseKeeper and married these several Years pray tell me If in any one Article I have charged too much Whether if I have not rather undercharged them and omitted several that I being unacquainted with these Sort of Things can have no Knowledge of  If therefore it is a moderate Computation and necessary supposing Interest to continue at five  per Cent  which is unlikely the Produce of l is only l s and if it should fall to four  per Cent  is only l In the one Case I must necessarily expend on my Wife l in the other l s above the Income of the Fortune she brings besides the Hazard and Want of Security for the Money which ought to be considered  and though it be necessary yet how reasonable it is I submit to you  These Things considered and he that marries without previous Consideration acts very indiscreetly I do not see how I can marry a Woman with the Fortune you propose or that I should better my self at all by it and in Prudence People should do so or let it alone not that I propose or think to have more I must therefore live single tho' with some Regret that I cannot do otherwise and increase my own Fortune which happens to be sufficient for my own Maintenance till if I may so call it I can afford Matrimony  I wish the Lady all Happiness and a better Husband and if it be for her Satisfaction one who has thought less of the Matter not but that I have a very good Opinion of Matrimony and think of it with Pleasure as hoping one Time or other to enter into its List but I now wait with Patience till my Circumstances or Thoughts vary  One Thing I would not have you mistaken in is that I do not mean that your Relation will be thus expensive to me more than any other only that whenever I marry let her be who she will I must necessarily if she has no more Fortune  than you propose expend considerably more than l a Year on her above the Income of her Fortune and at present I cannot persuade my self to be at so great an Expence for the Sake of trying a dangerous Experiment whether the Pleasures of Matrimony are Yearly worth that Sum All which is submitted to your Consideration by  SIR  Your most Obliged Humble Servant  The Married Man's ANSWER TO THE BATCHELOR's ESTIMATE OF THE EXPENCES of a Married Life In a LETTER to  JOHN SINGLE  of GRAY'SINN  Esq  LONDON  Printed in the Year MDCCXLII  The Married Man's ANSWER TO THE BATCHELOR's ESTIMATE OF THE EXPENCES of a Married Life In a LETTER To  John Single  of  Gray'sInn  Esq  Dear SIR  YOUR Estimate has been read over and considered in our Family and now lies upon the Table to be perused by the Neighbours  Several Objections have been made to it I shall take Notice of some of them It is observed That you do not deal with that Candour and Ingenuity in stating the Account that you ought to do for in the Way you compute you make  no Allowance for the Reputation and Advantage which you will in many Respects gain and which will accrue to your self by a House kept in the Manner you mention the Credit of which in a great Measure centers in you while the Care of it lies wholly upon your Wife So that in  l per Annum  consisting of fourteen Articles from the Butcher's Bill down to BrickDust RottenStone Whiteing and other little Ingredients you will be found not only to be the greatest Cause of the Expence but will have the principal Share in the Pleasure and in the Esteem obtained by it tho' it is true  FullersRents  and  SheerLane  lose  s    d  a Day by your Dinners The same Error runs through some other Articles for my Relation will not I believe easily comprehend why she should be solely loaded with the Charge of expending  l per Annum  upon Children which you seem very well disposed to get Besides let me tell you  Jack  you ought to bring into the Account the Saving which will arise from the regular Proceeding in that Affair which upon the Change of your Condition you must make to come wonderfully cheap to you a Grandee of  Spain  reproached the Lady whom he had married with a small Fortune that he believed that every Pleasure he had had with her had cost him a  Dobloon  a Time she replied that was none of  her Fault for his Excellency might have reduced it to six  Denieres  a Time if he had pleased in the two Years they had lain together I doubt you sink an Article of your Expence here you know  Jack  your beloved  Horace  says there are Things  quibus doleat Natura negatis  and does not loveless joyless unindeared casual Fruition cost you Money You tell us of the Doctor and the Apothecary when you are married 'tis well for you if you steer clear of the Surgeon before you enter into that State Nothing but urgent Necessity can draw Money from you he that deals in cheap Pictures and cheap Women is a Loser at last  In your concluding Remark you seem unjustly to diminish my Kinswoman's Fortune for is not the  l  Furniture of your House and TableLinen with the  l  for Plate your own as much as if it were in Cash And does not every Circumstance in a married Life recommend you to the World equal to the Money it costs you if laid out prudently You have a Settlement by it that makes you a better Subject a more useful Friend and a more virtuous Man  How many are they who by Degrees hardening themselves against the Sex established by the Laws of Nature and of the Land at last fall into a horrible and odious Sin of NonConformity never  tolerated in any Christian Country This sometimes draws an Expence after it in a Composition far exceeding the  l per Annum  the proper and sole Charge of the Pleasures of Matrimony by your own Calculation which you cannot persuade your self to undergo as not thinking them yearly worth that Sum  Consider  Jack  who are your truly idle Fellows in Town and Country that saunter away their Time at CoffeeHouses and at GamingTables They are all or most of them of your Family Mr  Single  The young Fellows who are always studying how to spend Time to pass away Time to wear away Time to kill Time they are all of your Family the Reason is plain they have nothing in the World for which it is worth while to improve Time Besides Idleness teacheth all Kind of Evil and while you by your parsimonious Celibacy deny your self the proper Remedy you cherish the Disease and at the same Time you endeavour to check the River in its natural Channel you make it overflow the bordering Meadows  What Topicks are used to incite a Man to defend the Liberty of his Country 'Tis for the Sake of his Family and Posterity for the Sake of his Wife and Children the Argument will have little Force if urged for the Sake of  Jack Single  at his Chambers two Pair of Stairs high in  Grey'sInn  What Argument did the  Gascon  use to restrain a Man from a rash as he thought it Action Fighting with him won't you consider crys the  Gascon  when their Swords were drawn your Wife No says the Man Won't you consider crys he your Wife and Children No No says the other then I will reply'd the  Gascon  and gravely put up his Sword  I shall conclude with the Words of DIVINE MILTON  Hail wedded Love Mysterious Law true Source  Of Human Offspring sole Propriety  In Paradise of all Things common else  By thee Adult'rous Lust was driv'n from Man  Among the Bestial Herds to range By thee  Founded in Reason loyal just and pure  Relation dear and all the Charities  Of Father Son and Brother first were known  Perpetual Fountain of Domestick Sweets  Here Love his Golden Shafts employs here lights  His constant Lamp and waves his purple Wings  Here reigns and revels  And with DRYDEN  When fix'd to one Love safe at Anchor rides  And dares the Fury of the Winds and Tides  But losing once that Hold to the wide Ocean borne  It drives away at Will to ev'ry Wave a Scorn  FINIS  NONE BUT Fools  Marry  OR A VINDICATION OF THE BATCHELOR's ESTIMATE In ANSWER to the OBJECTIONS made against it  LONDON  Printed in the Year MDCCXLII  NONE BUT Fools  Marry  AS I am the real Author of the  Batchelor's Estimate  which has for some Time afforded Diversion to and undergone the Criticisms of the Town I think in Justice to it I should vindicate it from the Aspersions thrown on it and the Author especially from those in Print that I think worth considering As to two of them the LADY's ANSWER and the WOMAN's ADVOCATE I shall take no farther Notice of them than that they have the Names of Answers only to make the Copies of the  Estimate  which they annexed to them and pirated from the true Proprietor to sell the better As to the first the Town at its first coming out was sufficiently satisfied 'twas a  Grubstreet  as to the second I think it beneath a Gentleman to answer  it because no Gentleman could have wrote it consisting of so much Scurrility It's sufficient Satisfaction to me to observe that the Readers of it from its being so preposterous and scurrilous immediately cry out of the Author  This Fellow is a Fool  As to the Married Man's Answer because 'tis wrote like a Gentleman and with no such sordid View as the others were I chuse for those Reasons to answer it and shall therefore in so doing address myself to the Author thereof  The first Thing Sir you begin with by way of Answer is That I make no Allowance for the Reputation and Advantage which you say I shall in many Respects gain by Housekeeping Could you have mentioned any one of those many Respects I don't doubt but that you would but such a general Charge without any Reason or Foundation mention'd to support it seems to me to argue as if you could not maintain your Allegation and indeed I can't conceive how you can Does paying ParishTaxes clear our Intellects or does Matrimony refine our Judgements If not how comes it about and on what Foundation can the  married Man  and Housekeeper have a greater Reputation than the  Batchelor  I must own I don't know But now I think on't indeed in one respect he may that is by marrying an agreeable Woman he stands a very fair Chance of having a  Reputation now very much in vogue in that State which I thank my Stars I as a  Batchelor  am only capacitated to give but not to receive Was I to employ a Person to manage my Affairs I should chuse to employ the  Batchelor  in regard the  married Man  has so much to do to mind his FamilyAffairs he'll have but little Time to mind those of others  As to the Deductions you would have made on the Account of casual Fruition and the consequential Articles of it before you make such a Deduction you should first lay it down as necessary that young Fellows must  Whore  or  Marry  otherwise 'tis ungenerous to tax me as I have not committed the one that I must the other If you make it out that a Batchelor must go a  whoring  you have found out something new and as the first Discoveries of any Thing  useful  ought to have Thanks you have mine If there's no such Necessity for ought you know I may be one of those  Batchelors  that walking between two Precipices  Whoredom  and  Matrimony  may have so cautiously directed my Steps as to avoid both But as 'tis not for my  Credit  with the Fair Sex to pretend not to have been gratified by any of them I own I have had some Amours but not with such as were sordidly prostituting their Charms for Gain but with those only who gratified  me for no other Prospect than an equal Return of Love consequently no Deduction ought to be made on the Account of the Expence of it But supposing that my Taste has been so very low as to take up with those that lett their Charms to hire and that I have been at some Expence in that Respect yet as Women are nowadays very cheap pardon me I mean those of the Town and their Price runs at a low Ebb  l  a Year will drive a pretty good Trade with that Sort of Ware and I am told you may agree by the Great and for Five Guineas a Year insure yourself against any ill Consequences that may happen And if the Expence of casual Fruition is no more as prudent Dealers therein assure me it is not I am sure the Undervaluations and Omissions in my Estimate amount to above twice those Sums  You alledge and for Argumentsake suppose it true that in the Articles of Housekeeping I shall have the principal Pleasure yet I must be at six Parts in seven of the Expence Pray how stands it then Is that Encouragement to commence Husband  'Tis not my Wife but I shall bear the Load of the Expence of Children for you see her Fortune can scarcely answer any Expence at all but as she partakes of an equal if not as most allow a greater Pleasure in the begetting them I don't  see why she should not proportionably contribute to their Maintenance  By the Story of the  Spanish  Grandee you would insinuate and consistent enough with your Admission of my being well dispos'd to get Children that let it cost me what it will I may by a frequent Repetition of the Pleasures of Matrimony and I dare say not disagreeable to my Wife reduce the Expence of each Pleasure to a very minute Sum unless it was my own Fault which admits a Readiness of one Side But on a second Calculation of the Expences of the Estimate I find I shall pay for those Pleasures at the Rate of  s    d  for each Night's Lodging a meer Trifle you'll say But however whether after HoneyMoon is over which by the Way they tell me is the shortest in the Year those Pleasures will be so frequent as to reduce the Expence of them to a very minute Sum or on the other Side whether several  s  Pences will not be expended towards each Pleasure is the hazardous Experiment I still decline to make but leave it to those who have shot the  Gulf  and now know the Danger to reflect how prudent they were when they undertook so hardy an Enterprize where let the dear Partner be sullen and ill temper'd or gay and goodnatur'd let her by Chance or otherwise be ugly or agreeable  let her be obstreperous and unruly and  Xantippe  like scold me out of House and Home or be meek and condescending let her be expensive and what some good Wives have industriously done run me into Goal or the frugal and careful let her be healthy or ailing let her be a  Messalina  or a  Lucrece  let her have all the ill and none of the good Qualities yet this  dear Creature  I am destin'd to love and cherish for Life she must be Partaker of my Bed and Board From this Bargain tho' ne'er so ill concerted there's no Appeal lies or any Redress to be had Who then that lives already comfortably and happy would not knowing when he was well be Fool enough to make an Experiment where if it happens according to his Wishes he can but live still comfortable and happy and where if it does not as I believe most People will allow it to be a reasonable Chance to lay twenty to one against him he'll have only this sad Reflection I was happy but strove to be otherwise and am so Such an Experiment would be as prudent as that made by a Person who having a very valuable Diamond would needs try whether it was so hard as to bear the Strokes of a Hammer on an Anvil He satisfied his Curiosity what follow'd The Diamond broke and the Possessor of it curst his Stars for having been such a Fool  You say by Marriage I became a better Subject a more useful Friend and a more virtuous Man neither of which can I allow As to the first then There is no Law that commands or forbids us to marry He that does not transgresses no Law and he that does complies with none How can one then be a better Member of a Community or a better Subject than the other when what is said to make a Difference between them is in itself indifferent But as every Body thank Heaven is left to his own Choice and mine I think is the best being consistent with the Opinion of an inspired Writer I pronounce myself a better Subject who can without Injustice to any freely engage in the Service of my King and Country and as  Pomfret  says afford them  my Tongue my Pen my Fortune and my Sword  than he that is obliged to make use of all these to minister to the Necessities of a Family which he is ty'd to and which consistent with the Laws of God and Man 'tis his utmost Duty to provide for  To be a more useful Friend it is almost impossible for a married Man for he must and it is a great Sin if he omits it breed up maintain and provide for his Family if during that Time he should provide for a Relation do a Friend a Kindness or this or that Act of Charity it  will be looked upon to be and so it is in Fact so far a Robbery of his own Family so that the Tyes of his Duty in that Respect are so strong he can scarce do one Act of Benevolence to any other so true is the old Proverb  Charity begins at Home  And even when he has done all he can his thankless Children which by the way is no great Encouragement to beget them think he made a very ill Use of his Time in not having raised them greater Fortunes Whereas the  Batchelor  having none but himself to provide for and having the same Methods and Talents of becoming rich with  the married Man  without a Quarter of the Expence soon gains that End while it is well if the married Man with his greatest Industry supports his Family  The Batchelor  gives his Niece or Cousin a Fortune and places her in the World binds a Nephew Apprentice puts out a poor Child to School relieves a poor iudustrious Family struggling with Poverty lends or gives a Friend a Sum on an Emergency ALL these he does not as a Performance of any Duty incumbent on him nor will it be esteemed as such but as meer Acts of Benevolence he robs none he does none Injustice his Family at home want it not he is valued and respected as a truly generous Soul he sees the good Things he does rewarded in the Gratitude of the Receivers  of his Benevolence and in the Increase of his Fortune which with his good Intentions gives him Ability whilst the  married Man  tho' perhaps he may have the Inclination yet very seldom has the Ability of being half so useful a Friend as the Batchelor  As to the married Man's being more virtuous than a Batchelor I am satisfied there are so many Provocations to Passion in FamilyConcerns that the married Man lies under a frequenter Temptation to Sin in that respect And besides the necessary Parsimony a Husband must be Master of to support his Family often betrays him into a strange Narrowness of Temper and Avarice And every Body knows that there are Sins and great ones too incident only to a married State which it is well if they are avoided Those of  Omission  even were our Bosom Friends our Wives Judges I dare say are not few  As to the odious Sin of Nonconformity I think it is ungenerous in the highest Degree to suggest any Thing without due Grounds for it but let it stick on the Guilty As for my Part I assure you I love the Fair Sex so well I would willingly oblige them in any Thing in the World but  marry  them  As to sauntering at CoffeeHouses and Loss at Play I would have you know I have Business  to employ me so as not to be idle and even not to have Time so much almost as to think of Matrimony for I think none but Idlers do think on it and as to Play I am so far averse to any Thing that is attended with Hazard and Uncertainty that I decline Matrimony on that Account being with respect to the Hazard of it a Species of Gaming  The Ladies are much obliged to you for being their Advocate all the Men of Honour will surely be married immediately there will scarce be a Girl left for by the  Gascoon  Story you have plainly shewn that those that marry and have Families must of necessity be Cowards and yet I don't know how to think them so since they DARE  marry  As to the two Quotations out of  Milton  and  Dryden  pray read the following ones out of the same Authors and reconcile them  Oh Why did God  Creator wise That peopled highest Heav'n  With Spirits Masculine create at last  This Novelty on Earth this fair Defect  Of Nature and not fill the World at once  With Men as Angels  without Feminine  Or find some other Way to generate  Mankind This Mischief had not then befal'n  And more that shall befal Innumerable  Disturbances on Earth thro'  Female Snares  And strait Conjunction with the Sexfor either  He never shall find out  fit Mate  but such  As some  Misfortune  brings him or Mistake  Which infinite Calamity shall cause  To human Life and  Houshold  Peace confound  MILTON  Marriage thou Curse of Love and  Snare  of Life  That first debas'd a Mistress to a Wife  Love like a Scene at Distance shall appear  But  Marriage  views the grossdaub'd Landscape near  Love's nauseous Cure thou cloy'st whom thou should'st please  And when thou cur'st then thou art the Disease  When Hearts are loose thy Chain our Bodies ties  Love couples Friends but  Marriage  Enemies  And again  Lord of yourself uncumber'd with a Wise  Where for a Year a Month perhaps a Night  Long Penitence succeeds a short Delight  Minds are so hardly match'd that ev'n the first  Tho'  pair'd by Heaven  in Paradise were  curst  For Man and Woman tho' in One they grow  Yet first or last return again to Two  He to God's Image she to his was made  So farther from the Fount the Stream at random stray'd  How could he stand when put to double Pain  He must a Weaker than himself sustain  Each might have stood perhaps but each  Alone  Two Wrestlers help to pull each other down  Not that my Verse would blemish all the Fair  But yet if some be bad  'tis Prudence to beware  And better shun the Bait than struggle in the  Snare  DRYDEN  I would gladly know what End is attained by Matrimony you say and 'tis admitted the Batchelor has had particular Favours granted him by the Fair Sex and that he's no Novice to their Charms What Excuse has he then for Matrimony only an idle Curiosity to try whether the Pleasures a Woman affords you that has sordidly tied you Neck and Heels in Loads of Parchments and Settlements and who would have differ'd with you if your Estate had fell short of being adequate to her Fortune by l a Year whether those Pleasures are more refined than those of a truly generousspirited Girl that obliges  you without Signing and Sealing And there's one Thing remarkable that the latter neither expects nor desires your Affections any longer than she by her continuing agreeable merits them and in case as in all other fair Dealings you don't like her you are at your Liberty to act as you please But the former in case she does not answer the Sample of her Face the only one you are permitted to have and proves disagreeable she sticks to you for Life and as if touched with Birdlime the more you struggle the less you have Power so to do  But to return to my Estimate I can't conceive why I should as I find I have made so many of the Fair Sex my Enemies Says one I will certainly pull him by the Nose another threatens to box my Ears a third excludes me from the TeaTable I am forbid to make my usual Visits to them But what is most unreasonable those Viragoes I find are all out of the Case my Estimate has nothing to do with them for their Fortunes are so small exclusive of their own dear Persons which some more amorous Gentlemen may think Fortune enough that they won't bear to be estimated But did they but rightly consider is it not more generous to refrain even tho' contrary to Inclination as I proposed till my Circumstances can afford to  maintain a Woman genteelly than marry and with both our Fortunes but just barely subsist  Did young Fellows before they marry but coolly sit down and consider what they were going about and make proper Estimates 'tis to be hoped the Number of miserable Wives and unprovided Children would be very much diminish'd But in answer to all that can be alledg'd of the Expensiveness of a married State the Women cry out the Pleasures thereof are so great they are not to be rated according to any Expence that attends the purchasing of them 'Tis true Batchelors  are at a Loss  to guess what they are and if that will do the Fair Sex any Service I will admit them very great yea next to those of Heaven for like them I am sure they are  inconceivable  But now I think on't why do I talk of marrying I can have no Hopes of such Happiness each fair Lady is determined not to have the wicked calculating Batchelor tho' they'd do well to stay till they are ask'd no not if he was worth  l  But why because he told the Truth If that's to be the Case tho' I don't say I will not have them if they were worth so much and I must have NO WIFE I say CONTENT or to use the Words of a Great Man of the Law BE IT SO  From what I have said I would not have you think I dislike Matrimony or that I would cast an Odium on or ridicule that State as some modern Batchelors do Say they Matrimony is like a hungry Dog and a Bone no sooner is the Bone found but the Dog wonderfully pleas'd with the Adventure endeavours all he can to devour it but alter the Position of the Bone take it and tie it to his Tail the poor Creature runs from it with all his Speed nor is he easy till he gets rid of it Nor can I commend a Gentleman pretty well known in Town that lay in almost the worst Condition the Gratification of a loose Passion could bring him to who cry'd out in a faultering Tone to his Friend and Visitor  Even This  TOM  is better than Matrimony  No  Higher of the Genial Bed by far  And with mysterious Reverence I deem  I am Dear Sir Your very Humble Servant JACK SINGLE  Gray'sInn  We shall conclude our MISCELLANY with the two following SONGS  THE Man who for Life  Is blest with a Wife  Is sure in a happy Condition  Go Things how they will  She sticks by him still  She's Comforter Friend and Physician  Pray where is the Joy

Conjugal Kiss  When Passion is prompted by Duty  Poor Man  c  The Dog when possess'd  Of Mutton the best  A Bone he may leave at his Pleasure  But if to his Tail  'Tis ty'd without fail  He's
