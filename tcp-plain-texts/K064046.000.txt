 A DISSERTATION ON ANTIENT TRAGEDY  WHILST the taste genius and knowledge of the ancients have been universally felt and acknowledged in every other part of polite literature it is matter of admiration to consider that the Greek Theatre should so long have remain'd in neglect and obscurity In philosophy morals oratory and heroic poetry in every art and science we look back to Greece as the standard and model of perfection the ruins of Athens afford even to this day fresh pleasure and delight and nothing but her stage seems to be forgotten by us Homer Xenophon Demosthenes and many other eminent Greek writers have of late years put on an English habit and gain'd admission even into what is call'd polite company whilst Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides still lurk in schools and colleges and very seldom make their appearance at least with dirty leaves in the libraries of the great To what shall we attribute a judgment so capricious and so unaccountable partly perhaps to the hasty severity of ignorant foes and partly to the outrageous zeal of  The remarks which are handed down to us on Antient Tragedy have hitherto for the most part consisted of mere verbal criticisms various readings or general and trite exclamations of undistinguishing applause made by dull and phlegmatic commentators totally void of taste and judgment add to this that the old tragedians have been shamefully disguised and misrepresented to the unlearned by the false medium of bad translations  mistaken friendship The fate of Antient Tragedy hath indeed been singularly unfortunate some painters have drawn a too flattering likeness of her whilst others have presented us with nothing but a caricature some exalt the Greek drama as the most perfect of all human compositions without the least spot or blemish whilst others affect to call it the infant state of the stage weak infirm and imperfect and  as such treat it with the highest degree of negligence and contempt exaggerated thus on the one hand by the extravagant encomiums of injudicious learning and debased on the other by the rash censures of modern petulance it's real and intrinsic merit hath never been thoroughly known or candidly enquired into the best method however in this as in every other disputed point is to set aside all prejudice and authority and determine the cause by our own reason and judgment from a fair full and impartial view of it  THAT the spectator may be able to form a proper and complete idea of any object presented to him it is necessary to place him in such a situation as that his eye may at once comprehend the whole and every part of it for this purpose I have collected and ranged in order a few materials which in the hands of some abler writer may possibly lay the foundation for a complete history of the Antient Drama in the mean time the following sheets confine themselves to and pretend to no more than a brief account of the origin and progress of the Greek Tragedy it's end and purport the several parts properties and conduct of it the construction scenery and decorations of the theatre to which is added a transient but necessary view of the genius character and situation religion morals and politics of the people before whom it was represented together with a short sketch of the lives and characters of the three great tragedians  On the Origin of TRAGEDY  NOTHING is more agreeable to the inquisitive mind than to trace the gradual improvement of any art or science to mark the causes of it's growth and culture and pursue it through it's various stages of perfection it is much to be lamented therefore that neither Aristotle nor any other writer on Antient Tragedy hath given us an exact or regular account of it's progress and advancement from the time of it's birth to that of it's maturity and splendor the few scatter'd anecdotes which remain concerning it rather serving to awaken our curiosity than to afford us any full and satisfactory information  TRAGEDY was in it's infancy like every other production of human art extremely weak low and contemptible that wide and deep stream which flows with such strength and rapidity through cultivated Greece took it's rise from a small and inconsiderable fountain which hides itself in the recesses of antiquity and is almost buried in oblivion the name alone remains to give us some light into it's original nature and to inform us that Tragedy like every other species of poetry owed it's birth to religion  TRAGEDY or the  From  a goat and  a song The commentators not content with this most natural and obvious interpretation have given us several others Some of them turn  into  and so derive it from  the lees of wine with which we are told the actors smear'd their faces others inform us that  signifies new wine a skin of which was it seems usually given to the poet like the butt of sack to our laureats as a reward for his labours but I shall not trouble my reader with the enumeration of their whimsical conjectures  song of the goat was only a sacred hymn Bacchus we are told the first cultivator of vines imparted his  secret to a petty prince in Attica named Icarius who happening one day to espy a goat browzing on his plantations immediately seized and offer'd him up as a sacrifice to his divine benefactor the peasants assembled round their master assisted in the ceremony and express'd their joy and gratitude in songs and dances on the occasion the  This story is told by Brumoy and by twenty others with little variation It seems notwithstanding to carry with it the air of a fiction so far as it regards Icarius who seems only to have been introduced because Icaria was famous for vines and as Spon tells us in his voyage to Italy was the first place where they sacrificed a goat to Bacchus and also where tragedies and comedies were first exhibited but surely the song of the goat might be accounted for without application to any particular person Bacchus being the acknowledged inventor and cultivator of the vine it was most natural that the first planters should sacrifice to him the destroyers of it the goat being a creature as remarkably fond of the leaves of the vine as his sacrificer was of the juice of the grape we shall find that he fell a victim not to Bacchus alone and that the poet as well as the god came in for a share of him  sacrifice grew into a festival and the festival into an annual solemnity attended most probably every year with additional circumstances when the countrymen flock'd together in crowds and sung in rustic strains the praises of their favourite deity The rural sacrifice became in process of time a solemn feast and assumed all the pomp and splendor of a religious ceremony poets were employed by the magistrate to compose hymns or songs for the occasion such was the rudeness and simplicity of the age that their bards contended for a prize which as  Vilem certavit ob hircum  Art Poet  Horace intimates was scarce  worth contending for being no more than a goat or skin of wine which was given to the happy poet who acquitted himself best in the task assign'd to him  THIS was probably the period when Thespis first pointed out the tragic path by his introduction of a new personage who relieved the Chorus or troop of singers by reciting part of some wellknown history or fable which gave time for the Chorus to rest All that the actor  When Tragedy assumed a regular form these recitations which during it's imperfect state were only adventitious ornaments became the principal and constituent parts of the drama the subject of them drawn from one and the same action retaining their first name of episode  repeated between the songs of the Chorus was call'd an episode or additional part consisting often of different adventures which had no connection with each other Thus the Chorus or song which was at first the only and afterwards the principal performance became gradually and insensibly but an inconsiderable though as we shall see hereafter a necessary and ornamental part of the drama  FROM this time we may imagine the actor or reciter was more attended to than the Chorus however his part was executed it had the powerful charms of novelty to recommend it and quickly obscured the lustre of the Chorus whose songs were now of a different nature insomuch that the original subject of them the praise of Bacchus was by degrees either slightly mention'd or totally pass'd over and forgotten the priests who we may suppose for a long time presided over the whole were alarm'd at so open a contempt of the deity and unanimously exclaim'd that all this    was nothing to Bacchus the complaint grew into a kind of proverbial saying and as such is handed down to us  FROM the origin of Tragedy to the days of Thespis and from his time to that of Aeschylus all is doubt conjecture and obscurity  neither Aristotle nor any other antient writer give us the least insight into the state and progress of the Greek drama if his treatise call'd  This treatise contain'd an exact account of the names times and authors of all the plays that were ever acted  had reach'd posterity it would probably have afforded us much pleasure and instruction the names of a few and but a few tragedians during this dark period are handed down to us such were  The Bacchae a tragedy of his is cited by Athenaeus  Epigenes the Sicyonian and Pratinas who wrote fifty plays thirtytwo of which are said to have been satyrical after Thespis came his scholar Phrynicus who wrote nine tragedies for  See Strabo Herodotus and Plutarch  one of which we are told he was fined fifty drachmas because he had made it an odd reason too deep and too affecting there was also another Phrynicus author of  Call'd Andromeda and Erigone  two tragedies to these we must add  Mention'd by Macrobius and Pollux  Alcaeus Phormus and  Choerilus is said to have written no less than a hundred and twenty tragedies  Choerilus together with Cephisodorus an Athenian who wrote the Amazons and Apollophanes supposed to have been the author of a tragedy named Daulis though Suidas is of another opinion  TRAGEDY during the lives of these writers had in all probability made but a slow progress and received very little culture or improvement when at length the great Aeschylus arose who from this rude and undigested chaos created as it were a new world in the system of letters Poets and even epic poets there might perhaps have been before Homer dramatic writers there certainly were before Aeschylus the former notwithstanding we may with the utmost propriety stile the inventor and father of  heroic poetry and the latter of the antient drama which before his time doth not appear to have had any form shape or beauty He first introduced dialogue that most essential part of tragedy by the addition of a second personage threw the whole fable into action and restored the chorus to it's antient dignity  AESCHYLUS having like a tender parent endow'd his darling child with every mental accomplishment seem'd resolved that no external ornaments should be wanting to render her universally amiable he cloathed her therefore in the most splendid habit and bestow'd on her every thing that art could procure to heighthen and improve her charms We know from good authority that fifty years before his time Thespis exhibited his rude performances in a cart and besmear'd the faces of his actors with the lees of wine probably to disguise their persons and give them the appearance of those whom they represented but Aeschylus who as being himself author actor and manager took upon him the whole conduct of the drama did not neglect any part of it he improved the scenery and decorations brought his actors into a regular and wellconstructed theatre raised his heroes on the cothurnus or buskin invented the masques and introduced splendid  personae pallaeque repertor honestae  Aeschylus modicis instravit pulpita tignis  Et docuit magnumque loqui nitique cothurno  HOR  habits with long trains that gave an air of majesty and dignity to the performers  FROM the time when tragedy began to assume a regular form we find her closely following the steps of epic poetry all the parts of the epopée or heroic poem may be traced in tragedy though as Aristotle observes all the parts of tragedy are not to be found in the epopée whence the partisans of the stage with  some reason conclude that perfection in the former is more difficult to be attain'd than in the latter Without entring into this dispute we may venture however to stile  Homer says Aristotle was the first who  'invented dramatic imitations'  There was no more left for tragedy says Lord Shaftsbury than to erect a stage and draw his dialogues and characters into scenes turning in the same manner upon one principal action or event with regard to place and time which was suitable to a real spectacle  See Characterist vol II  Homer the source and fountain of the Antient drama from him the tragedians drew the plan construction and conduct of their fables and not unfrequently the fable itself to him they applied for propriety of manners character sentiment and diction  FROM this aera then we are to consider tragedy as an elegant and noble structure built according to the rules of art symmetry and proportion whose every part was in itself fair firm and compact and at the same time contributed to the beauty usefulness and duration of the whole edifice Sophocles and Euripides carefully studied the plan laid down by Aeschylus and by their superior genius and judgment improved it in a short time to it's highest state of perfection from which it gradually declined to the introduction of the Roman drama  On the parts of Antient Tragedy  AMONGST many other erroneous opinions concerning the Greek tragedy adopted by modern editors and commentators the unwarrantable division which they have made of it into  See a dissertation on this subject by Mons Vatry in the hist de l'acad vol p  acts is perhaps the most remarkable as there doth not seem to be the least ground or foundation for it in the first place neither Athenaeus nor any of the antient writers who have given us quotations from the Greek plays mention the act where the several passages are to be found which they would most naturally have done had any such division ever taken place It may be likewise observed that the word  The word  which we translate an act signifies the whole performance or drama and could not possibly therefore mean any one particular part of it  Act does not once occur in that treatise of Aristotle which gives us so exact a definition of every part of the Greek drama add to this that the tragedies themselves carry with them sufficient proof that no such thing was ever thought on by the authors of them notwithstanding which  Chorus says Vossius pars fabulae post actum vel inter actum actum See inst poet l  Vossius Barnes and several other editors have discover'd an office of the chorus which the poet never assign'd them namely their use in dividing the acts the intervals of which were supplied  by their songs though it is evident that the business of the chorus as will sufficiently appear in the following account of it was on the other hand to prevent any such unnatural pause or vacancy in the drama as the division into acts must necessarily produce besides that if we take the word act in that sense which the modern use of it demands we shall find it in the Greek tragedies composed sometimes of a single scene and sometimes of half a dozen and  On looking into the chorusses of Sophocles as they stand in the original we find that the Ajax besides the  which will be explain'd hereafter has five which are thus unequally divided to the first act two the second one the third one the fourth one the fifth none at all the Trachiniae has six the Electra but three and the Philoctetes but one regular song or intermede in the whole play If it be granted therefore as I think it is on all hands that wherever we meet with strophe and antistrophe and there only we are to conceive that the chorus sung nothing can be more absurd than to make those songs dividers of the acts when it is evident that the chorus sung only as occasion offer'd and the circumstances of the drama required which accounts for the irregularity and difference in the numbers of them If the reader will take the trouble to examine the antient tragedies he will find what I have said confirm'd in every one of them  if the songs or intermedes of the chorus are to determine the number of acts the play will consist not always of five according to our own custom but at one time of only three and at another of seven or eight  Neve minor neu sit quinto productior actu  Horace has indeed told us that there should be but five acts but it does not from thence follow that it always was so the truth after all is that this mistake as well as many others arose from an error common to almost the whole race of writers and critics on antient tragedy who have unanimously agreed to confound the Greek and Roman drama concluding them both to be govern'd by the same laws though they are in many parts essentially different they never allow for the time between Aristotle and Horace but leap from one to the other with the utmost  agility it is plain however from  Many other reasons equally forcible might be alledged some of which the reader will find scatter'd about in the notes to my Translation of Sophocles I shall only observe here that the old editions of the Greek tragedies so far from dividing them into acts do not so much as make the least separation of the scenes even the names of the persons are not always properly affix'd to the speeches no notice is taken of the entrances and exits of the actors the asides are never mark'd nor any of the gestures or actions which frequently occur pointed out to us in the margin defects which however inconsiderable may mislead the young and injudicious reader and which ought therefore to be carefully supplied by the critic or translator  the reasons here mention'd that the antient Greek tragedy was one continued representation from beginning to end  THE division into acts therefore is undoubtedly a piece of modern refinement which as much may be said on both sides I shall not stop either to condemn or approve but proceed to the only division which the antients ever made a division which nature points out to this and every other composition viz a  The cause and design of undertaking any action are the beginning the effects of those causes and the difficulties we find in the execution of that design are the middle the unravelling and resolving those difficulties are the end  See Bossu's treatise on epic poetry  beginning a middle and an end or in the words of Aristotle the prologue the episode and the exode  THE PROLOGUE of antient tragedy was not unlike the  or overture in music or the prooemium in oratory containing all that part of the drama which  Aristotle must certainly be understood to mean not the first entrance but the first song or intermede of the chorus because as Dacier and other writers have observed there are tragedies as the Persae and Suppliants of Aeschylus where the chorus enters first on the stage and opens the play to such therefore if Aristotle meant the speaking and not the song there would be no prologue a contradiction which is avoided by understanding what is here said of the  or first song which never begins till the prologue is over and matter furnish'd to the chorus for the intermede  preceded the first song or intermede of the chorus  WHAT Aristotle calls the prologue should contain according to the antient critics all those circumstances which are necessary to be known for the better understanding and comprehension of the whole drama as the place of the scene the time when the action commences the names and characters of the persons concern'd together with such an insight into the plot as might awaken the curiosity of the spectator without letting him too far into the design and conduct of it This however easy it may seem at first view is so difficult that it has scarce ever been perform'd to any degree of perfection Of the Greek tragedians Sophocles alone seems to have succeeded in this particular the prologues of  According to this rule the prologues of Aeschylus and Euripides will by no means stand the test of examination that part of the tragedy which precedes the first song of the chorus being often employ'd by those writers either in absurd addresses to the spectators or in the relation of things extremely foreign to the purpose of the drama frequently anticipating the incidents and circumstances of the play and even sometimes acquainting the audience beforehand with the catastrophe all of them capital errors which the superior judgment of Sophocles taught him carefully to avoid  Aeschylus being quite rude and inartificial and those of Euripides for the most part tedious and confused  THE EPISODE is all that part of the tragedy which is between the songs or intermedes of the chorus this answers to our second third and fourth act and comprehends all the intrigue or plot to the unravelling or catastrophe which in the  Sophocles who was certainly the most correct of the three great tragedians has I think observed this rule in all his plays but two viz Ajax and Oedipus Tyrannus for if the death of Ajax is the catastrophe of that tragedy it is over long before the last song of the chorus if the leave granted to bury him be the catastrophe as some critics contend the Episode is confined within it's proper limits but this cannot be allow'd without attributing to this piece what is a still greater blemish a duplicity of action a dramatic crime of which Sophocles in that play I am afraid cannot easily be acquitted In the Oedipus Tyrannus it is observable that the total discovery of Oedipus's guilt is made before the last song of the chorus and becomes the subject of the intermede  best antient writers is not made till after the last song of the chorus the conduct and disposition of the Episode may be consider'd as the surest test of the poet's abilities as it generally determines the merit and decides the fate of the drama Here all the art of the writer is necessary to stop the otherwise too rapid progress of his fable by the intervention of some  Brumoy compares the fable of a good tragedy to a large and beautiful temple which the skill of the architect hath so contrived as to make it appear at first view of much less extent than it really is wherein the farther you advance the more you are surprised at the vast intervening space which the extraordinary symmetry and proportion of it's parts had conceal'd from the eye  new circumstance that involves the persons concern'd in fresh difficulties awakens the attention of the spectators and leads them as it were insensibly to the most natural conclusion and unravelling of the whole  THE EXODE is all that part of the tragedy which is recited after the chorus has left off singing it answers to our fifth act and contains the unravelling or catastrophe of the piece after which it is remark'd by the critics any song of the chorus would only be tedious and unnecessary because what is said when the action is finish'd cannot be too short  On the CHORUS  WE come now to an essential  Aristotle ranks the chorus amongst what he calls parts of quantity and places it after the Exode  part of antient tragedy peculiar to itself whilst every other member of the building is universally admired and industriously copied by modern architects this alone hath been rejected and contemn'd as ungraceful and unnecessary The chorus as I before observed gave the first hint to the formation of tragedy and was as it were the cornerstone of the whole edifice as a religious ceremony it was consider'd by the multitude with a kind of superstitious veneration it is not therefore improbable that the first authors of the regular drama willingly gave way to popular prejudices and for this among many other reasons incorporated it into the body of the tragedy accordingly we find the chorus of Aeschylus resuming it's original office reciting the praises of the local deities demigods and heroes taking the part of distress'd virtue and abounding throughout in all those moral precepts and religious sentiments by which the writings of the antients are so eminently and so honourably distinguish'd  VARIOUS are the arguments that have from time to time been produced by the zealous partizans of antiquity in favour of the tragic chorus the principal of which I shall briefly recapitulate and lay before my readers begging leave at the same time to premise that whether a chorus is defensible with regard to the antient theatre and whether it should be adopted by the modern are two very different questions though generally blended  and confused by writers on this subject the former may perhaps be easily proved though the latter be left totally undetermined The antients thought it highly improbable that any great interesting and important action should be perform'd without witnesses their chorusses were therefore composed of  A chorus interposing and bearing a part in the progress of the action gives the representation that probability and striking resemblance of real life which every man of sense perceives and feels the want of upon our stage a want which nothing but such an expedient as the chorus can possibly relieve  This is the remark of one of the most ingenious and judicious critics which our own age or perhaps any other ever produced the reader will find it with many others equally just p of the first volume of a commentary and notes on Horace's Art of Poetry and Epistle to Augustus  such persons as most naturally might be supposed present on the occasion  Thus in the Ajax of Sophocles the chorus is composed of the men of Salamis his countrymen and companions in the Electra of the principal ladies of Mycenae her friends and attendants in the Philoctetes of the companions of Ulysses and Neoptolemus the only persons who could with any propriety be introduced The rest of this writer's plays and his only will stand the test of examination by the rule here mention'd  persons whose situation might so far interest them in the events of the fable as to render their presence useful and necessary and yet not so deeply concern'd as to make them incapable of performing that office to which they were more particularly appointed the giving proper advice and making proper reflections on every thing that occur'd in the course of the drama for this purpose a choriphaeus or leader superintended and directed all the rest spoke for the whole body in the dialogue part and led the songs and dances in the intermede By the introduction of a chorus which bore a part in the action the antients avoided the absurdity of monologues and soliloquies an error  which the moderns have imperceptibly and necessarily fallen into from their omission of it they avoided also that miserable resource of distress'd poets the insipid and uninteresting race of confidentes a refinement for which we were indebted to the French theatre who only appear to ask a foolish question listen to the secrets of their superiors and laugh or cry as they are commanded  BUT the great use and advantage of the chorus will best appear when we come to consider it in it's moral capacity In that illustrious period which may be call'd the golden age of tragedy the stage was not only the principal but almost the only vehicle of instruction Philosophy applied to the liberal arts for their influence and assistance she appear'd in the theatre even before she dictated in the academy and Socrates is supposed to have deliver'd many of his excellent precepts by the mouth of his  Hence Euripides was call'd '  ' 'the philosopher of the theatre'  in iis says Quintilian quae a sapientibus tradita sunt ipsis paene par  With regard to Socrates his friendship with this poet is universally known '  ' says Diogenes Laertius The comic poets of that time did not scruple to ascribe several of Euripides's plays to Socrates as they afterwards did those of Terence to Laelius and Scipio  favourite poet this sufficiently accounts for the sententious and didactic part of the antient drama for all that profusion of moral and religious sentiments which tires the patience and disgusts the delicacy of modern readers the critics of those times were of opinion however they may differ from our own in this particular that the first and principal characters of the piece were too deeply interested in their own concerns and too busy in the prosecution of their several designs and purposes to be at leisure to make moral or political reflections such therefore they very judiciously for the most part put into the mouth of the chorus  this at the same time  Euripides being obliged to put some bold and impious sentiments into the mouth of a wicked character the audience were angry with the poet and look'd upon him as the real villain whom his actor represented the story is told by Seneca  Now if such an audience says the ingenious writer whom I quoted above could so easily misinterpret an attention to the truth of character into the real doctrine of the poet and this too when a chorus was at hand to correct and disabuse their judgments what must be the case when the whole is left to the sagacity and penetration of the people  prevented the illiterate and undistinguishing part of the audience from mistaking the characters or drawing hasty and false conclusions from the incidents and circumstances of the drama the poet by this means leading them as it were insensibly into such sentiments and affections as he had intended to excite and a conviction of those moral and religious truths which he meant to inculcate  BUT the chorus had likewise another  The office of the chorus is divided by Aristotle into three parts which he calls  and  the parodos is the first song of the chorus the stasimon is all that which the chorus sings after it has taken possession of the stage and is incorporated into the action and the commoi are those lamentations so frequent in the Greek writers which the chorus and the actors make together See the second scene of the second act of Ajax in my translation Philoctetes act one scene three the beginning of the Oedipus Coloneus together with many other parts of Sophocles's tragedies where the commoi are easily distinguishable from the regular songs of the chorus  office which was to relieve the spectator during the pauses and intervals of the action by an ode or song adapted to the occasion naturally arising from the incidents and  Neu quid medios intercinat actus  Quod non proposito conducat haereat apte  HOR  This connection with the subject of the drama so essentially necessary to a good chorus is not always to be found in the tragedies of Aeschylus and Euripides the latter of which is greatly blamed by Aristotle for his carelessness in this important particular the correct Sophocles alone hath strictly observed it  connected with the subject of the drama  here the author generally gave a loose to his imagination display'd his poetical abilities and sometimes perhaps too often wander'd from the scene of action into the regions of fancy the audience notwithstanding were pleased with this short relaxation and agreeable variety sooth'd by the power of numbers and the excellency of the composition they easily forgave the writer and return'd as it were with double attention to his prosecution of the main subject to this part of the antient chorus we are indebted for some of the noblest flights of poetry as well as the finest sentiments that adorn the writing of the Greek tragedians The number of persons composing the chorus was probably at first indeterminate varying according to the circumstances and plot of the drama Aeschylus we are told brought no less than fifty into his  In the Eumenides of Aeschylus the chorus consisted of fifty furies whose habits gesture and whole appearance was by the art of the poet render'd so formidable as to frighten the whole audience an accident which so alarm'd the public that a decree was immediately issued to limit the number of the chorus  Eumenides but was obliged to reduce them to twelve Sophocles was afterwards permitted to add three a limitation which we have reason to imagine became a rule to succeeding poets  WHEN the chorus consisted of fifteen the persons composing it ranged themselves in three rows of five each or five rows of three and in this order advanced or retreated from the right hand to the left which is call'd  It does not appear that the old tragedians confined themselves to any strict rules with regard to the division of strophe antistrophe and epode as we find the choral songs consisting sometimes of a strophe only sometimes of strophe and antistrophe without the epode the observing reader will find many other irregularities of this kind in a perusal of the Greek tragedies  strophe and then back from  the left to the right which we call antistrophe after which they stood still in the midst of the stage and sung the epode  Le Choeur says Brumoy alloit de droite à gauche pour exprimer le cours journalier du firmament d'orient en occident ce tour s'appelloit strophe il declinoit ensuite de gauche à droite par égard aux planettes qui outre le mouvement commun ont encore le leur particulier d'occident vers l'orient c'etoit l'antistrophe ou le retour enfin le choeur s'arretoit au milieu du théâtre pour y chanter un morceau qu'on nommoit epode pour marquer par cette situation la stabilité de la terre  Some writers attribute the original of these evolutions to a mysterious imitation of the motion of the heavens stars and planets but the conjecture seems rather whimsical The dance we may imagine if so we may venture to call it was slow and solemn or quick and lively according to the words sentiments and occasion and in so spacious a theatre as that of Athens might admit of such grace and variety in it's motions as would render it extremely agreeable to the spectators the petulancy of modern criticism has frequently made bold to ridicule the use of song and dance in antient tragedy not considering as Brumoy observes that dancing is in reality only a more graceful way of moving and music but a more agreeable manner of expression nor indeed can any good reason be assign'd why they should not be admitted if properly introduced and carefully managed into the most serious compositions To say the truth nothing is more astonishing than the prejudices we entertain and the partiality we shew with regard to our own modes and customs we condemn the chorusses of the antients which supplied with decency and propriety the vacant parts of the drama and how do we fill up our own To be convinced of our injustice and absurdity let us suppose Sophocles or Euripides transported from the shades of elysium and entering one of our noisy theatres between the acts the audience engaged in bowing or talking to each other and the music entertaining  them with a jig of Vivaldi or the roast beef of old England how would they be surprised in a few minutes to find that all this disorder riot and confusion was in the midst of a most pathetic and interesting tragedy and that the warmest passions of the human heart were broken in upon and enfeebled by this strange and unnatural interruption  THE chorus continued on the stage during the whole representation of the piece unless when some very  As in the Ajax of Sophocles where the chorus leave the stage in search of that hero and by that means give him an opportunity of killing himself in the very spot which they had quitted and which could not have been done with any propriety whilst they were present and able to prevent it on these occasions the chorus frequently divided itself into two parts or semichorusses and sung alternately  extraordinary circumstance required their absence this obliged the poet to a continuity of action as the chorus could not have any excuse for remaining on the spot when the affair which call'd them together was at an end it preserved also the unity of time for if the poet as  See his whole art of the stage page of the English translation  Hedelin observes had comprehended in his play a week a month or a year how could the spectators be made to believe that the people who were before them could have pass'd so long a time without eating drinking or sleeping Thus we find that the chorus preserved all the unities of action time and place that it prepared the incidents and inculcated the moral of the piece relieved and amused the spectators presided over and directed the music made a part of the decoration and in short pervaded and animated the whole it render'd the poem more regular more probable more pathetic more noble and magnificent it was indeed the great chain which held together  and strengthen'd the several parts of the drama which without it could only have exhibited a lifeless and uninteresting scene of irregularity darkness and confusion  THE antient chorus notwithstanding with all it's advantages is not agreeable to every taste it hath been attack'd with great severity and treated with the utmost contempt it hath been call'd arrant pedantry an excrescency of the drama a mob of confidents even writers of approved genius and judgment have said that it is absurd to imagine the antients would ever have trusted their secrets especially those of a criminal nature to all their domestics that it is impossible to imagine that fifty or even fifteen people can keep a secret fifteen people of the same mind thought voice and expression  IT must be acknowledged that these critics have selected that part of the office of the chorus which is most liable to censure but even if we allow the objection it's full force it will not suffice to condemn the chorus itself which in the judicious Sophocles who avoided the errors and absurdities of his cotemporaries is unexceptionable in that noble author nothing is entrusted to the chorus which ought to be conceal'd nor any thing conceal'd which ought to be imparted to them we might therefore perhaps with equal justice banish from our own stage the general practice of soliloquies because Shakespear hath frequently drawn them out to an immoderate length as utterly condemn the whole antient chorus because Euripides hath in two or three of his plays made an improper use of it  'Who shall decide when doctors disagree'  SOME applaud the chorus with a kind of enthusiastic rapture whilst others endeavour to sink it into universal contempt for my own part I cannot but think it absolutely necessary on the antient stage and that it might be render'd useful and ornamental even on our own  I am notwithstanding far from being of opinion that it should be admitted constantly and indiscriminately into the modern theatre the use of it must depend entirely on the subject certain it is that there are many in our own history as well as in that of other nations where a chorus might be introduced with the utmost propriety but if after all fashion and prejudice will not suffer them to appear on the stage they may at least gain admission to the closet thither let the reader of true taste and judgment carry Elfrida and Caractacus written on the antient model and compare them with Athelstan

Verse Recitation and Music of Antient Tragedy  THE art of poetry was consider'd by the antients as a part of that general system which they term'd the  or melody and was in reality the art of making verses proper to be sung they look'd upon words not only as signs of particular ideas but as sounds also enabled by the assistance of music to express all the passions of the human mind When in the descriptive parts of the drama a dreadful or disagreeable object was to be represented the words were form'd of such harsh and jarring syllables as by grating on the ear might best impress the exactest representation of it and in like manner when the grand the beautiful or the tender was to be set before the eyes of the spectator the language was carefully and even painfully adapted to it The Greeks who were extremely solicitous to cultivate and improve their language to the highest degree of perfection took more than ordinary care in the formation of their verse the quantity of every syllable was carefully ascertain'd different words different dialects and different feet were appropriated to different species of poetry and none infringed on the rights and privileges of another Tragedy indeed as the sovereign assumed a kind of peculiar title to them all every species of verse was occasionally introduced to adorn and beautify the drama The iambic was generally made use of in the body of the piece as approaching according to the judgment of Aristotle nearest to common discourse and therefore most naturally adapted  to the dialogue this rule however is not constantly and invariably observed but sometimes departed from with judgment the metre is frequently changed not only in the songs of the chorus but in other places and that generally in the most interesting and impassion'd parts of the drama where it may here be observed it is most probable that the music and instruments accompanying the verse were changed also a happy circumstance for the poet as it must have afforded an agreeable relief to the audience who would naturally be fatigued by the repetition of the same sounds be they ever so harmonious  Since the expulsion of tragedies in rhime of all things doubtless the most absurd some of our best poets have introduced what is call'd a tag consisting of three or four couplets at the end of every act to relieve the ear from the monotony of blank verse but even this is now exploded and we are confined to the repetition of the same continued metre from beginning to end  If our own times manners and taste would admit of such variations what additional beauties would they reflect on the British theatre but such a change of metre in serious dramatic performances is render'd absolutely impossible as well from many other obstacles as from

chorus but diffusing itself through the whole drama In the th chapter of his problems he asks why the tragic chorusses never sing in the hypodorian or hypophrygian mood which are both employ'd in the scenes from which passage as well as many others that might be quoted it is evident that they sung both in the scenes or dialogue part and in the chorus also  accompanied with music  throughout and that the reciter had little else to do than carefully to observe the directions of the poet the quantity of every word was ascertain'd the time duration and rhythmus of every syllable fix'd by the

over some parts with precipitancy and drawling out others into a tedious monotony a good voice and a tolerable ear were all that the poet required of him  MUSIC is rank'd by Aristotle amongst the

rest the principal exertion of it's powers must we may imagine have been reserved for the songs or intermedes of the chorus where both the poetry and music admitted of much greater freedom and variety than in the other parts of the drama thus we see in the Antient Theatre music always accompanied her sister science assisted animated and supported her was in short in all respects her friend and fellowlabourer  Qualem decet esse sororem  The office of a dramatic poet in the time of antient tragedy required we may observe a wider circle of knowledge and far more extensive abilities than the present age demands or expects from him for besides all the other requisites it was necessary that he should be master of every kind of verse completely skill'd in music and able to direct all the evolutions movements or if so we chuse to call them the dances of the chorus Euripides we are told instructed his singers in the grave and solemn airs which accompanied all his pieces and Plutarch informs us that the people of Susae and the Persians by the command of Alexander sung the tragedies of Sophocles and his successors in the drama according to the measures which those writers had themselves prescribed at the first representation of them  TRAGEDY was in it's infancy what Aristotle calls it    made up of music and dancing and the old tragedians Thespis Pratinas Cratinus and Phrynicus according to Athenaeus bore the name of    dancers because they used so much dancing in their chorusses Tetrameters were therefore for a long time made use of  in the verse as that foot was

instruments the antients made use of in their theatrical music and in what it's principal merit consisted it is perhaps at this distance of time not easy to determine if any of my readers are desirous of prying into a subject so dark and intricate I must refer them to Plutarch's dialogue on this subject together with Mons Burette's observations on it in the tenth volume of the hist de l'Acad to which may be added P Menestrier's dissertation on antient and modern music where they will meet with as much information as I believe can be given them on this head  THE use of music in tragedy hath been matter of much doubt and contention with modern critics M Dacier thinks it by no means essential and greatly condemns Aristotle for his approbation of it it is notwithstanding indisputable that on the antitient stage music was a most beautiful adjunct to poetry and contributed in a great measure to the high finishing and perfection of the Greek drama we cannot perhaps so easily resolve how

judicious manager of Drurylane theatre has introduced it into several other tragedies with success  one of our theatres we have reason to think that when introduced with propriety it might be attended with it's desired effect  On the Construction of the Greek Theatre  THE GREEK THEATRE is amongst those superb monuments of antient taste genius and magnificence which would probably have survived the depredations even of time itself if ignorance and barbarism had not conspired to ruin and destroy it of all those noble and costly structures which Athens and Sparta dedicated to the muses we have now scarce any thing but a few inconsiderable remains sufficiently striking to raise our curiosity but at the same time too mutilated and imperfect to satisfy it Those writers of antiquity who have occasionally mention'd the construction of the theatre as they treated a subject universally known by their cotemporaries did not think themselves obliged to handle it with that degree of accuracy and precision which were so necessary for the information of posterity in consequence of which they frequently gave names to one part of the building that more properly belong'd to another and by a confusion of terms which could not mislead the readers of their own times involved their successors in a labyrinth of error and obscurity add to this that the same fate hath attended the description of the building which had before happen'd to the several constituent parts of the drama modern critics too often confound together the Greek and Roman theatre though they differ most essentially in many parts we find terms frequently appropriated to one which belong only to the other and the whole so imperfectly delineated by almost every one of them as to render it throughout a matter of doubt and uncertainty Some lights however have from time to time been thrown on this dark and intricate subject whose scatter'd rays when united and drawn to a point will exhibit to us the following tolerably accurate though still imperfect representation of it  THE ANTIENT GREEK THEATRE in it's highest state of perfection was a most spacious noble and magnificent structure built with the most  The theatre at Athens was originally built with wood but being one day remarkably crowded on the exhibition of a tragedy written by Pratinas the benches fell in many of the spectators were kill'd and the whole fabric buried in ruins this melancholy accident induced the Athenians naturally fond of spectacles to set about the construction of those superb edifices which they afterwards made use of built with the most costly marble and adorn'd with every thing that could render them solid noble splendid and magnificent  solid and durable materials and capable we are told of holding thirty thousand spectators to give my readers a proper idea of it's form I shall divide it into three principal departments one for the actors which they call'd the scene another for the spectators under the general denomination of the theatre and a third call'd the orchestra allotted to the music mimes and dancers To determine the situation of these three parts and consequently the disposition of the whole it is necessary to observe that the plan here annex'd consists on one side of two semicircles drawn from the same centre but of different diameters and on the other of a square of the same length but less by one half the space between the two semicircles was allotted for the spectators the square at the end to the actors and the intervening area in the middle to the orchestra Thus we see the theatre was circular on one side and square on the other round the whole were ranges of porticos see letters A and B more or less according to the number of stories the most magnificent

of extraordinary merit where all those were placed who had distinguish'd themselves by any signal services to the commonwealth such in process of time became hereditary and were appointed for particular families all these were very near to or sometimes in the orchestra and as close as the structure of the theatre would admit to the scene or place of representation  THE orchestra being between the two parts of the building one of which was circular and the other square partook of the shape of both varying in it's size according to that of the theatre though it's width was always

will find in the first volume of the hist de le acad quarto edition p  which they ascended to the different stories of the theatre some leading to the seats others to the porticos of course turn'd different ways but all equally wide disengaged from each other and so commodious as to give sufficient room for the spectators to go in and out without the least crowding or inconvenience  BETWEEN the orchestra and the stage was the  hyposcenium letter E so call'd because it was close to the scene or place of representation here it is most probable were placed the instruments that accompanied the actors throughout the drama  Between this part and the proscenium Mr Boindin places the Greek  or thymele letter F so call'd because in shape it resembled an altar here he imagines the chorus was placed and perform'd their songs and dances but this place with all due deference to that ingenious critic could by no means be allotted to the chorus being much too distant from the stage where we know from the tragedies themselves the chorus must always be as besides the songs or intermedes it bears a part in the dialogue throughout the piece and consequently must stand close to the other actors  BEYOND this was the large and vacant space call'd  proscenium or  letter D representing the scene of action which was always some public place as a road a grove a courtyard  adjoining to some temple or palace the length and breadth of this area or stage varied according to the size of the theatre but always of the same heighth and in the Greek theatre never more or less than ten foot  AT the extremity of the whole building was the  or postscenium letter G that place behind the scenes where the actors dress'd themselves and prepared the habits scenes machines and every thing necessary to the representation  AT the back of the stage letter L were the triangular machines for the scenery call'd by the Greeks  Utrimque aliae interdum portae quarum in postibus affixae machinae  dictae quae pro re ac tempore circumagebantur Suid To these Virgil is supposed to allude in the third book of the Georgics  Vel scena ut versis discedat frontibus  Which is thus explain'd by Servius 'Scena says he quae fiebat aut versilis aut ductilis versilis tunc erat cùm subito tota machinis convertebatur aliam picturae faciem ostendebat ductilis tunc cum tractis tabulatis hàc atque illàc species picturae nudabatur interior' What Virgil mentions was probably an improvement on the  as practiced in the Roman theatre  which as they turn'd on their own axis might be shifted on any occasion and exhibited three different views or changes of scene these were not made use of in tragedy which required but one scene throughout but most probably at the end of it to prepare the exhibition of the comedy or mime which in the antient theatre frequently succeeded each other perhaps two or three times on the same day  AMONGST the many peculiarities of the Greek theatre with regard to it's construction there is not perhaps any thing so remarkable and which we can so difficultly form any idea of as the echoea or brazen vessels which according to  Vasa aerea says Vitruvius quae in cellis sub gradibus mathematica ratione collocantur ad symphonias musicas sive concentus ita componuntur uti vox scenici sonitus conveniens in dispositionibus tactu cum offenderit aucta cum incremento clarior ac suavior ad spectatorum perveniat aures  To these echoea it is supposed Cassiodorus alludes where he says  tragaedia concavis repercussionibus roborata talem sonum videtur efficere ut paene ab homine non credatur  Cass ep lib  Vitruvius were made use of by the Greeks to render the articulation distinct and give a more extensive power to the voice an expedient doubtless extremely necessary in so large a theatre for this purpose we are told that they had recourse to several round concave plates of brass placed under the seats of the spectators so disposed and contrived by the most exact geometrical and harmonic proportions as to reverberate the voice and carry the words of the actor to the farthest part of the building the manner in which this was perform'd is I must confess to me utterly incomprehensible certain it is that no idea can be form'd of it without the most profound knowledge of antient music and antient architecture I shall not therefore trouble my readers with an explication of what few I believe would be able to comprehend but if any of them are desirous of a more intimate acquaintance with these Brazen Echos I must refer them to the sixth book of the learned Vitruvius and Mons Burette's treatise on antient music  On the Scenes Machines and Decorations  THOUGH we have no genuine or regular account now extant of the machines and decorations of the Greek theatre we have sufficient reason to conclude from the tragedies themselves still remaining that such things were made use of in the representation as we find in almost every one of them gods ascending and descending ghosts and furies frequently appearing on the stage with divinities celestial and terrestrial for all these we need not doubt but that the antients had machines of various kinds according to the various exigencies and circumstances that required them and as we learn from the scatter'd remains of Hesychius Pollux and other writers were no strangers to  sunt rudentes scenici quibus per tractoria organa latentes personae sustollebantur in scenam  rudentes qui ex alto suspensi sunt ut sustineant eos qui aere ferri videntur  Pollux  trapdoors flying chariots magnificent arches flights ropes pullies and in short all the mechanical apparatus of the stage As to the scenery we know that the strict regard paid by the Greek tragedians to the unity of place confined the whole representation of their pieces to one particular spot this however we find was sumptuously adorn'd with all the embellishments which art or nature could furnish magnificent  Scenae tragicae says Vitruvius deformantur columnis fastigiis signis reliquisque regalibus rebus  columns porticos statues paintings bassorelievos every thing which the elegant taste and genius of Greece could produce was added to enrich the  scene even so early as in the time of Aeschylus we are  Tum Athenis Agatarchus Aeschylo docente tragediam primus scenam fecit de eo commentarium reliquit ex quo moniti Democritus Anaxagoras de eadem re scripserunt quemadmodum oporteat ad aciem oculorum radiorumque extensionem centro constituto ad lineas ratione naturali respondere uti de re incertâ certae imagines aedificiorum in scenarum picturis redderent speciem quae in directis planisque frontibus sint figurata alia absidentia alia prominentia esse videantur  Vitruvius lib viii  told that the decorations of the theatre were made according to the exactest rules of perspective The whole theatre porticos excepted being as I before observed uncover'd and consequently exposed to the heat of the sun and inclemency of the weather a kind of thin curtain fasten'd probably to a large pillar or pole in the centre of the building was extended over the whole as the heat notwithstanding which is always the case in our modern tents frequently penetrated through them and the breaths of so numerous an assembly must have been offensive they had recourse to artificial showers of rain which they convey'd from the top of the porticos through the statues that were dispersed over the different parts of the building  As I do not remember that we have any authority from antient Greek writers for this anecdote I should rather be inclined to consider the perfumed water as a refinement of modern luxury and ascribe it to the improvements of the Roman theatre  Mr Boindin adds that the water on these occasions was always scented so that the spectators were not only refresh'd by this gentle dew falling upon them but at the same time regaled with the most exquisite perfume  On the MASQUES  IT appears from the united testimonies of several antient writers that the actors of Greece never appear'd on the stage in tragedy or any other species of the drama without masques it is most probable that before the time of Aeschylus to whom  Suidas and Athenaeus attribute the invention of masques to the poet Choerilus Horace gives the honour to Aeschylus but Aristotle who we may suppose was as well acquainted with this matter as any of them fairly acknowledges himself entirely ignorant of it '  says he  '  Horace ascribes this invention they disguised their features either as in the days of Thespis by daubing them with the lees of wine or by painting false hair and other artifices of the same kind with those which are practiced in the modern theatre Masques however were soon introduced and look'd on we may imagine in those days as a most ingenious device that which they made use of in tragedy was according to the best information we can gather concerning it a kind of casque or helmet which cover'd the whole head representing not only the face but the beard hair ears and even in the women's masques all the ornaments of the coif or cap being made of  The first masques were made of the leaves of a plant to which the Greeks on this account gave the name of    quidam says Pliny Arcion personatam vocant cujus folio nullum est latius  Virgil mentions them as composed of the barks of trees  Oraque corticibus sumunt horrenda cavatis  And Pollux tells us that they were made of leather lined with cloth or stuff    different materials according to the  several improvements which it received from time to time the most perfect and durable were of wood executed with the greatest care by sculptors of the first rank and eminence who received their directions from the poet It seems to have been an establish'd opinion amongst the antients that their heroes and demigods who were generally the subject of their tragedies were of an extraordinary size far surpassing that of common mortals we must not be surprised therefore to find their tragic poets in compliance with this popular prejudice raising them upon  The cothurnus or buskin was a kind of large and high shoe the sole of which being made of very thick wood raised the actors to an extraordinary size Juvenal tells us that it made them appear extreamly tall and compares an actress without her cothurnus to a pygmy  breviorque videtur  Virgine pygmaea nullis adjuta cothurnis  The cothurnus was probably of the same form as the high shoe or piece of cork bound about with tin or silver worn by the Spanish women call'd a chioppine and which it should seem by a passage in Shakespear was used on our own stage  Your ladyship is nearer heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chioppine  Hamlet act scene  the cothurnus swelling them to an immense magnitude and by the assistance of a  The tragic masques had large and expanded mouths as if says the humorous Lucian they were about to devour the spectators    large and frightful masque endeavouring to fill the minds of the spectators with a religious awe and veneration of them the tragic masques were generally copied from the busts or statues of the principal personages and consequently convey'd the most exact idea and resemblance of them which must have given an air of probability to the whole those which represented  The masque commonly used was call'd simply  the others  and    ghosts and furies were made still more terrible and frightful  but the masques of the  says Lucian      dancers or persons who form'd the body of the chorus had nothing disagreeable  As in the infancy of tragedy there were probably but few actors the use of masques gave each of them an opportunity of playing several parts wherein the character age and sex were different without being discover'd the large opening of the mouth was so contrived as to increase the sound of the voice and send it to the farthest part of the theatre which was so extremely large and spacious that without some such assistance we cannot easily conceive how the actor could be well heard or seen in all theatrical painting scenery and decoration the objects we know must be magnify'd beyond the life and reality to produce their proper effect and in the same manner we may imagine that in so extensive an area as the Greek theatre it might be necessary to exaggerate the features and enlarge the form of the actor add to this that at such a distance as most of the spectators were the natural expression of the eyes and countenance must be entirely lost The sanguine admirers of every thing that is antient bring many more arguments to defend the tragic  Masques have had their admirers in modern as well as in antient times and been used on more stages than that of Greece even towards the middle of the last century the actors both in tragedy and comedy on the French theatre wore masques The English is doubtless in this respect as well as in many others infinitely superior to the Athenian stage notwithstanding which I will promise to join the  and vote for the restoration of the antient masque whenever they will shew me one that can represent the happy features of Quin in the Character of Falstaff or give us an idea of a frantic Lear like the look and face of the inimitable Garrick  masque but after all that can be said in it's favour it is perhaps scarce defensible the face is certainly the best index of the mind and the passions  are as forcibly express'd by the features as by the words and gesture of the performer the Greeks in this as in many other particulars sacrificed propriety truth and reason to magnificence and vanity  ALL the expences of the theatre were defray'd by the state and were indeed so considerable that nothing but the purse of an opulent republic could possibly have supported them as it is confidently affirm'd by  This assertion which seems rather hyperbolical is notwithstanding supported by the grave Plutarch who speaking of the Athenians assures us that the representation of the Bacchanals Phoenissae Oedipus Antigone Medea and Electra cost them more money than the defence of their own liberties in the field or all their contests with the barbarians  historians that Athens spent more in dramatic representations than in all her wars  Of the time when Tragedy flourish'd in Greece  IT was not my design in this short Dissertation nor could indeed be comprehended within the limits of it to point out with Aristotle what tragedy ought to be but simply to shew what it was during the lives of the great triumvirate as far as we can judge from the remains now extant in my account of it's several parts therefore I have not follow'd the steps of the great critic but principally confined myself to those particulars which distinguish the antient from the modern drama and which may best enable us to form a proper and adequate idea of the Greek tragedy but even the most perfect knowledge of all the essential and constituent parts will be found insufficient for this purpose unless we take into our view also the time when and the very spot where every piece was exhibited Dramatic as well as every other species of poetry is best known and distinguish'd by the place of it's birth it will take it's form colour and complection from it's native soil as naturally as water derives it's taste and qualities from the different kinds of earth through which it flows it is absolutely necessary before we can judge impartially of the Greek tragedies to transport ourselves to the scene where they were represented to shake off the Englishman for a time and put on the Athenian  IT has been with great truth remark'd that there is allotted to every nation upon earth a particular period which may be call'd their zenith of perfection to which they approach by slow degrees and from which they gradually and insensibly recede in this happy age of power and prosperity the arts and sciences  taste genius and literature have always shone with distinguish'd lustre such was the time when Athens gave laws to all Greece whilst the glorious victories of Marathon and Salamis animated every tongue with eloquence and fill'd every breast with exultation that haughty and successful people maintain'd for a long time her sovereignty over the neighbouring nations her councils were influenced by prudence and her battles crown'd with conquest the treasure which she had seized in the temple at Delphos enabled her not only to carry on her wars with success but left her a plentiful reserve also to supply her luxuries this was the age of heroes philosophers and poets when architecture painting and sculpture foster'd by the genial warmth of power and protection so conspicuously display'd their several beauties and produced all those superb monuments of antient taste and genius which united to distinguish this illustrious aera during this happy period tragedy appear'd in her meridian splendor when the great triumvirate exhibited before the most polite and refined nation then upon earth those excellent pieces which extorted applause honours and rewards from their cotemporaries and ensured to them the deserved admiration of all posterity it may indeed with great truth be asserted that the same remarkable love of order and simplicity the same justness of symmetry and proportion the same elegance truth and sublimity which appear'd in the buildings pictures and statues of that age are conspicuous also in the antient drama  IN the time of the Greek tragedy the Athenians dictated as it were to all mankind proud by nature and elated by riches and prosperity they look'd down with the utmost contempt on the neighbouring nations whom they stiled and treated as barbarians as a republic the avow'd enemies of monarchy and dependence as a free people bold and impatient of restraint or contradiction strongly attach'd to their own laws and customs lively and active  but inconstant and superstitious their manners plain and simple but their taste at the same time elegant and refined As the theatre was supported entirely at the expence of the public the public directed all it's operations we might naturally expect therefore that the poet would for his own sake take care to adapt his compositions to the public taste to fall in with national prejudices and superstitions to sooth the pride flatter the selflove and adopt the opinions of his fellowcitizens we must not wonder to hear as we constantly do in the tragedies that remain the praises of Athens perpetually resounded the superiority of her laws and constitution extoll'd and her form of government prefer'd to every other oblique hints or direct accusations of folly and weakness in her enemies public facts frequently alluded to and public events recorded their own festivals sacrifices  See amongst many other instances the noble description of the Pythian games in the second act of Electra v p of my translation of Sophocles and the sacred grove of the Eumenides in the Oedipus Coloneus v p  religious rites and ceremonies carefully and accurately described Sparta and Thebes as rival states occasionally satyrized and condemn'd and above all every opportunity taken to point out the evils of monarchy and engrave their favourite democratical principles on the hearts of the people it is not improbable but that many of those moral sentences and political apothegms which at this distance of time appear cold and insipid to us had besides their general tendency some double meaning some allusion to particular facts and circumstances which gave them an additional lustre without this key to the Greek theatre it is impossible to form a right idea of antient tragedy which was not like our own mere matter of amusement but the channel of public instruction and the instrument of public policy those readers therefore who are utterly unacquainted with the religion laws and customs of Athens are by no means adequate judges  of it they only  Damnant quod non intelligunt  Quintilian  condemn for the most part what they do not understand and rashly judge of the whole edifice whilst they view but an inconsiderable part of the building But so warmly are we attach'd to what lies before us and so prejudiced in favour of those modes and customs which are establish'd amongst ourselves that we generally rate the merit of past performances by the standard and rule of present practice the antients therefore are subject to the disadvantage of being tried not as justice demands by their laws but by our own  AND here it is worthy of our observation to remark that the Greek tragedy seems in it's whole progress to have kept pace with the place of it's birth and to have flourish'd and declined with it's native country the rise of Athens from meanness and obscurity to power and splendor may be dated from the battle of Marathon which laid the foundation of all her future glory soon after which we find Aeschylus forming his plan of antient tragedy after him arose the immortal Sophocles who improved upon and greatly exceeded his illustrious master to these succeeded Euripides born ten years after the battle of Marathon and on the very day of the seafight at Salamis whilst these illustrious writers flourish'd Athens flourish'd also for above half a century Euripides was fifty years of age when the Peloponnesian war began from which period the superiority of Athens visibly declined and was soon entirely destroy'd by the rival power of Sparta in confederacy with the Persian

famous battles of Marathon Salamis and Plataea the perpetual scenes of slaughter and bloodshed in which he was during a long series of years unavoidably engaged seem to have tinged his imagination with that portion of the fierce and terrible so distinguishable in all his pieces during the intervals of his military occupation he found time to write no less than seventy or according to some historians ninety tragedies only seven of which are now extant when he was pretty far advanced in years he lost the poetical prize to Sophocles then but a boy or as other writers with more probability assert to Simonides in an elegy on the heroes who fell at Marathon a circumstance which so deeply affected him that he immediately withdrew from Athens and retired to the court of Hiero king of Sicily a friend of the muses whose palace was a kind of asylum for the discontented poets of Greece there we are told he lived in great affluence and splendor to the age of sixtyfive the writers of his life not willing to admit that so great a poet could dye a common death have thought proper to dignify his last moments with a circumstance which carries with it more  of the marvellous than the probable an oracle had it seems declared for oracles were always ready on these occasions that Aeschylus should fall by the hand of heaven accordingly that this might be fulfill'd it is reported that an eagle was seen in the air holding in her talons a tortoise which unfortunately for the bard she let go and dropping on the head of Aeschylus who happen'd to be walking beneath fractured his skull he is said to have gain'd thirteen victories over his rival poets which one would think was an ample recompence for the single failure that gave him so much uneasiness His tragedies were greatly admired during his life and after his death held in the highest esteem insomuch that a decree was pass'd by the senate declaring that if any person would exhibit the tragedies of Aeschylus the state would bear the charges of the chorus and defray the whole expence of the representation an honour which probably had not been bestow'd on any poet before his time though afterwards as I observed above they were generally play'd at the public cost  AESCHYLUS is a bold nervous animated writer his imagination fertile but licentious his judgment true but ungovern'd his genius lively but uncultivated his sentiments noble and sublime but at the same time wild irregular and frequently fantastic his plots for the most part rude and inartificial his scenes unconnected and illplaced his language generally poignant and expressive though in many places turgid and obscure and even too often degenerating into fustian and bombast his characters strongly mark'd but all partaking of that wild fierceness which is the characteristic of their author his peculiar excellency was in raising terror and astonishment in warm and descriptive scenes of war and slaughter if we consider the state of the drama when he

deserved it is remark'd that he never acted himself in any of his plays as Aeschylus and Euripides did his voice being too weak and low for the stage though he was always present at the representation

his moral reflections pertinent and useful and his numbers in every part to the last degree sweet and harmonious the warmth of his imagination is so temper'd by the perfection of his judgment that his

caress'd treated with the utmost respect and afterwards set them at liberty  EURIPIDES fortunately for his own character as well as for posterity is come down to us more perfect and entire than either of his cotemporaries his merit therefore is more easily ascertain'd his fables are generally interesting his plots frequently irregular and artificial his characters sometimes unequal but for the most part striking and well contrasted his sentiments remarkably fine just and proper his diction soft elegant and persuasive he abounds much more in moral apophthegms and reflections than Aeschylus or Sophocles which as they are not always introduced with propriety give some of his tragedies a stiff and scholastic appearance with which the severer critics have not fail'd to reproach him it is most probable however that in this he complied with the taste of his age and in obedience to the dictates of his friend and master Socrates who we may suppose thought it no disgrace to this favourite poet to deviate from the rigid rules of the drama in order to render it more subservient to the noble purposes of piety and virtue there is besides  in his dialogue a didactic and argumentative turn which savours strongly of the Socratic disputant and which probably procured him the name of the    philosopher of the theatre  IT is said of Sophocles that he painted men as they ought to be of Euripides that he painted them as they were a quaint remark which I shall leave the critics to comment and explain only observing that the latter is much more familiar than the former descends much lower into private life and consequently lets down in some measure the dignity of the buskin which in Sophocles is always carefully supported there are some scenes in Euripides where the ideas are so course and the expression so low and vulgar as if translated with the utmost caution would perhaps greatly shock the delicacy and refinement of modern manners the feeling reader notwithstanding will be amply recompenced by that large portion of the tender and pathetic the peculiar excellency of this poet which is diffused throughout his works his chorusses are remarkably beautiful and poetical they do not indeed as Aristotle has observed always naturally arise from and correspond with the incidents of the drama this fault however his chorusses generally make amends for by the harmony of their numbers and the many fine moral and religious sentiments which they contain  UPON the whole though Euripides had not perhaps so sublime a genius as Aeschylus or a judgment so perfect as Sophocles he seems to have written more to the heart than either of them and if I were to place him with the other two in the school of painters I should be inclined from the softness of his pencil to call him the Corregio of the antient drama  FROM the works of these three illustrious writers and from them  Of all the Greek tragedies produced by various writers and which are almost innumerable we have only thirtythree now remaining though according to the generally received account no less than two hundred and sixty or upwards were written only by the three great tragedians all the rest except a few inconsiderable fragments fell a sacrifice to barbarity and are buried in oblivion  alone we must draw all our knowledge of the antient Greek tragedy which in the view we have here taken of it appears to be full complete and perfect and has been miserably disjointed and torn to pieces by the moderns from the ruins of this noble edifice have arisen two very imperfect structures the opera and tragedy of latter times both greatly though not equally defective the former confining itself merely to the eye and ear makes but a slight impression on the mind whilst the latter from it's omission of the chorus music scenery and decoration falls short of that beauty and perfection which is only to be found in the antient drama we must at the same time fairly acknowledge that our manners and customs our opinions views taste and judgment are so different from those of Greece that her drama is by no means in every respect a proper model and standard for modern poets and must after all we can advance in it's favour always remain among those reproachful monuments of the purity and simplicity of former ages which we cannot imitate though we are forced to admire  IT must be confess'd that antient tragedy hath it's share with every thing else of human imperfection too strict an attention to the unities hath fetter'd and confined it many of it's beauties are merely local and temporal the plots are frequently  uninteresting and illconducted the speeches either too long or too short the expressions sometimes course and indelicate in the general management and representation of the whole too much is sacrificed to popular prejudice superstition and vanity the ruling passions of an Athenian audience too strong an attachment to the laws customs and form of government then prevailing threw a dull air of uniformity over the drama the same story the same characters and sentiments even the same expressions too often occur in different tragedies that simplicity which so distinguish'd the manners of the antients had naturally it's influence over their taste also they selected one plain but noble object and all the variety which their dramatic poets aim'd at or which the spectators required of them was to place that in different lights without suffering any other to intercept the prospect of it they admitted no episodes underplots or any of those extraneous incidental ornaments which make up modern performances  One of the greatest advantages of modern tragedy over the antient is perhaps it's judicious descent from the adventures of demigods kings and heroes into the humbler walk of private life which is much more interesting to the generality of mankind  and confined themseves principally to the faults and perfections of the great as Milton observes of them  'High actions and high passions best describing  But because their taste was more correct and severe it doth by no means follow that it was less true and perfect than our own the moderns heap incident on incident sentiment on sentiment and character on character a change which is perhaps rather to be attributed to the corruption of our taste than to the improvement of it it is always a mark of a vitiated stomach when  wholsome and natural food is rejected with disgust and provocatives used to raise the appetite in the same manner I cannot but be of opinion that our impatient thirst after what critics affect to call business is nothing but the result of false taste and depraved judgment because antient tragedy is not crowded with a heap of unnatural episodes stuff'd with similies metaphors imagery and poetical flowers the moderns treat it with contempt and find nothing in it but a poverty of sentiment a want of order and connection in the scenes a flatness and insipidity in the dialogue a coarseness and indelicacy in the expression but even if we should grant the truth of every objection there would still remain to compensate for all these real or seeming imperfections a variety of true and striking beauties in antient tragedy and there only we shall find a most exact and faithful picture of the manners of Greece it's religious and civil policy sublimity both of sentiment and diction regularity symmetry and proportion excellent moral aphorisms and reflections together with a most elegant and amiable simplicity diffused through every page  IN a word to affirm as many who have more learning than judgment sometimes will that there are no good tragedies but the antient is the affectation of scholastic pedantry to deny them their deserved applause and treat them with ridicule and contempt is on the other hand the effect of modern pride ignorance and petulancy upon the whole French Italian Spanish and German critics may perhaps find some excuse for their severe animadversions on the antient Greek tragedy it may exercise their envy and find employment for their spleen and illnature as they have nothing of their own to put in competition with it but Englishmen should be above such envy  and such malevolence because they can boast a dramatic writer superior to all that antiquity ever produced we may safely join with the most sanguine partisans of Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides in the sincerest admiration of their several excellencies and rejoice within ourselves to see them all united and surpass'd in the immortal and inimitable Shakespear  FINIS
