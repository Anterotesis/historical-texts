 THE FAIR AMERICAN A COMIC OPERA IN THREE ACTS AS IT IS PERFORMED WITH UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE AT THE THEATREROYAL DRURYLANE  WRITTEN BY F PILON  DEDICATED TO THE RIGHT HON LORD CAMDEN LORD PRESIDENT OF HIS MAJESTY'S MOST HONORABLE PRIVYCOUNCIL  LONDON PRINTED BY J ALMON No FLEETSTREET  M DCC LXXXVâ–ª  TO THE RIGHT HON LORD CAMDEN LORD PRESIDENT OF HIS MAJESTY'S MOST HONORABLE PRIVYCOUNCIL  MY LORD  WHEN I consider the high rank you have long held as an enlightened Statesman an accomplished Orator and a wise Legislator I fear I shall incur the censure of presumption for daring to trespass upon that attention so much more nobly employed in meditating your country's good But great minds can descend with ease from the dignity of their spheres to the contemplation of the most minute objects and what would confuse or impede the operation of feebler faculties acts only as a relief to superior spirits lending them additional vigour in pursuits which call forth all their energies Your Lordship's partiality to the Dramatic Muse is well known and the MECAENAS of a GARRICK may naturally expect that Writers for the Stage will lay their offerings at the feet of a Nobleman universally allowed the most exquisite Judge in their own artNot content with the private satisfaction I enjoy from my veneration for splendid abilities and distinguished virtue I am ambitious the world should know I am capable of admiring themThere is a protecting influence in the name of CAMDEN that recommends to the wife and to the good it is auspicious to every Muse and every honorable undertakingand as such I have prefixed it to my work in imitation of the first CAESAR who concealed his baldness under a laurel  I have the honor to remain with the most profound respect MY LORD Your most devoted and obedient

AMERICAN  ACT I  SCENE  An Arbour in a Garden  CHARLOTTE  and  RACHEL  discovered  SONG  CHARLOTTE  WHEN unrelenting fates ordain  That lovers ne'er shall meet again  What object round can joy impart  Or wean from woe the bleeding heart  In shades and silent scenes we find  The only joy that soothes the mind  There uncontroul'd fond thoughts may rove  And back recall the hours of love  But ah when balmy Hope is fled  To Pleasure's voice the heart is dead  Then Mem'ry only wakes to shew  How deep the wretch is sunk in woe  The sailor thus who far from shore  Hears all night long the tempest roar  Soon as the morning lights the skies  Beholds his vessel bulge and dies  Rachel  I don't know how other people may find themselves but the coming on of winter always makes a vast change in my spirits I have often wished that I had wings that I might fly round the world after the summer  Charlotte  I never heard you find fault with the season of the year in London Rachel  Rach  Lord Ma'am one has so much pleasure in London it is impossible to know the difference betwixt summer and winter But how mortifying it is to live so trifling a distance from Bath and to be so seldom indulged with the pleasures of itI long to see my old master laid up with a fit of the gout as much as he does to get ease from it for then you know Ma'am the family would remove to lodgings on the South Parade with what pleasure I put on his flannels and see him pump'd of a morning  Charl  But I thought your regard for me had reconciled you to your present situation  Rach  And so it has Ma'am if my regard for you was not very great indeed do you think I'd consent to be buried alive in this old crazy mansionhouse that looks as if it were left standing only for the rooks to build their nests in Ah Ma'am if I had your beauty and your fortune I'd see the world and the world should see me too  Charl  But what could you do with a man of my father's temper  Rach  More than he could do with a girl of my spiritWhenever our sex is used ill by a crossgrain'd old father or a surly husband especially Ma'am when we are a little  handsomish  it is either because we don't know our own power or are afraid to use it Why there's Mr Summers now who has been so long courting you what is the reason Mr Bale won't consent to your marriage Isn't he a gentleman of as good family and as good fortune as any in the country Od's my life Ma'am pluck up a spirit and since he is determined to shut us up like two starlings in a dark cage I think it is fit he should know we have learned to talk in our confinement  AIR  RACHEL  When Cupid little fly rogue blooming fair and young  First wounds the lover's heart how sweet's a woman's tongue  We rob the bees of honey if we speak or sing  But when the knot is tied each word has then a sting  'Tis all clickclack whate'er we say  Both jarring night and noon  But ring the changes still each day  And talk things into tune  About his cage with joy the nimble squirrel climbs  His prison quire forgot whilst tinkling go the chimes  Thus husbands manag'd well tho' fetter'd to the ground  Think when they shake their chains there's music in the sound  'Tis all clickclack c  Charl  It is turned of five o'clock I expected my cousin Angelica before this hour from London  Rach  Ah the sweet good natured young lady Well if I was a man I should be in love with her up to  inspiration  I do believe I shall cry my eyes out whenever she returns to America  Charl  Her father has a fine fortune in that country and is too fond of his amiable daughter to let her continue much longer in Europe Though she has been only six months in England two of which you know she passed with us her near relations my esteem and regard for her are as fixed as if we had been friends from our infancy  Angelica  Without  No no I'll go into the garden to her  Rach  As I hope to be married Madam here comes Miss Angelica herself  Charl  With all the eagerness of true friendship I fly to meet her  Enter  ANGELICA  in a black Silk Cloak  Charl  My dear Angelica how happy have you made me by this visit  Ang  And to enhance the value of it I am come down to you when every body else begins to think of quitting the countryin the month of September  when the groves have ceased to be tuneful and old Autumn is shaking hands with Winter as if I came on the opening of the season to enjoy the pleasures of partridgeshooting  Rach  Comes forward  I hope your Ladyship has been well since I had the pleasure of seeing you last But I need not ask that few ladies bring such complections from London  Ang  I am very well Rachel thanks to a good constitution in spite of the gay scenes late hours and cloudy atmosphere of the capital  Charl  Go Rachel and prepare tea  Rach  Do you chuse it Ma'am here in the garden  Charl  No in the front parlour and let me know when it is ready  Exit  Rachel  Ang  There is a cloud hangs upon your brow Charlotte come open your heart and let friendship disperse it  Charl  You remember Mr Summers  Ang  Yes and from the grave tone in which you pronounce his name I conclude you two have quarrelledPho pho if that's all I'll make up the breach when lovers fall out the highpriest of Cupid is piling up the blind God's altars with a little fresh fuel which of course gives a temporary damp to the blaze but a few sighs breathed from the bottom of two repenting hearts and their flames burn brighter than before  Charl  Would I had nothing more serious to make me unhappy but every tender hope and fonder vision which rose in flattering prospect are no more Summers's visits have been long forbidden my inhuman father insists upon my banishing every thought of him as he had himself fixed upon another match for me I have never seen the husband of his choice nor did I know his name till this morning but I understand that he is next heir to a title and is expected here every hour to fulfil the ambitious views  of my father and give my fate for life the seal of wretchedness  RONDEAU  Adieu ye fleeting hours of love  That stole unmark'd away  And fondly promis'd once to prove  As blest each future day  Where yonder vi'lets scent the vale  I met the faithful youth  There first he breath'd his tender tale  And vow'd eternal truth  Such joys are past no more we meet  These wellknown haunts among  When Love's musician pipes so sweet  Her plaintive evening song  Adieu ye fleeting hours c  Ang  Poor CharlotteFortune is determined to persecute us both for know my friend I am not what I seemthe gaiety of my words and looks are all a counterfeit my heart is like yours the martyr of a fatal passiona passion so hopeless that every smile which peers upon my brow shews like a garland some poor victim wears that's doom'd to bleed in sacrifice  Charl  Can that be possible  Ang  You say that you are debarred all intercourse with the man of your heart he neither hears your sighs nor is witness to the tears you shed for him My destiny is to the full as forlorn with this difference that I have not the faintest hope of my passion ever meeting a return and that I am divided from the object of it as far as seas and the western world can part us  Charl  Is there a heart so insensible that loveliness like Angelica's could make no impression on  Ang  You shall hearAs my father lived in the interior part of the province of SouthCarolina he sent my brother attended by two servants to escort me in safety to Charles Town where I was to embark  for England Through the ignorance of guides we lost our way and fell in with a party of the French but were scarce made prisoners when an alarm was given of an enemy being in sight Oh Heavens how my heart beatIt was a detachment of horse from the King's troops Motionless and dumb I heard the shout of warsaw both battles charge when a trance relieved me from the agony of my fears The first object my eyes afterwards encountered was an officer in the British uniform who looked tenderly in my face as if he had been anxiously waiting my recovery Oh Charlotte how shall I describe him to youImagine a person the most captivating manners the most winningly polished and a countenance in which sweetness had so tempered the manly daring of the soldier that like Mars when disarming by the Graces he appear'd resigning the Laurel for the Myrtle of Love I hear the music of his voice this moment"Madam" said he taking me respectfully by the hand  you are no longer a prisonerIt gives me inexpressible concern that the nature of my orders will not allow me to see you safe to the end of your journey but if we ever meet again  At these sad words the drums beat and the trumpet blew its silver summons my brother in the same instant urged the dangers of delay and pressed me to renew our journey with reluctance and regret I yielded to his remonstrances when turning round to take a parting look of my gallant soldier I found he was gonethe whole party had rode off at full speed in a few minutes I could see nothing but a cloud of dust and for ever lost sight of my deliverer  Charl  Had you no means or opportunity of learning his name  Ang  Yes I understood from one of the wounded left behind after the action that his name is Mountford a Colonel in the English army  Charl  Mountford did you say Colonel Mountford  Enter  BALE  Bale  I am very proud Charlotte to find the Colonel employs so much of your thoughtsI have just received a packet from his father Lord Mountford acquainting me that his son arrived four days since from America and that I may expect him this afternoon at my house in order to fulfil the articles of the bargain concluded in his absence therefore prepare to receive the man who is to be your husband  Ang  Good HeavensWhat do I hear  Bale  Seeing  Angelica    Ah my blooming American RoseI am transported to see thee once more in the countryCome throw your arms around your old uncle's neck and let him welcome you  Kisses her  Ang  Dear Sir I am glad to see you  Bale  I vow to George this is very fortunateto come down just in the nick of time to be present at your cousin's weddingI certainly should have sent for you if I thought I could depend upon your keeping a secret but it is the part of prudence to conceal all plans of consequence till they are too ripe to be frustrated by accident or stratagem This was my method forty years ago in matters of business a secret in my possession was treasure underground no funding it out in whispers and halfhints to set the Bulls and the Bears of curiosity at work I was as close as an iron chest and had a knack of holding my tongue without ever looking the wiser for itBut this was all method and whoever expects to thrive in the world must consider method as the foundationstone upon which Trade builds the house of Wealth and Prosperity  Charl  Then Sir you are determined upon my undoing  Bale  'Zounds would you have me break my word with my Lord Mountford and forego the advantages of so noble an allianceBut say no more  my plan is laid and if I had no regard to my promise or to my interest I hope I have some little regard to consistency and method in my proceedings  Charl  But when the whole happiness of my life is at stake  Ang  Dear uncle will you suffer me to reason with you  Bale  I'll not hear a syllable from either partyI am fixed in my resolution and my daughter knows itDo you think I have got a weathercock upon my shoulders I never retract my word nay so rigidly am I attached to regularity and system that I never change my habits of action in any one particular In conformity to that rule look here at this coat  Shews his coat  it was the fashion thirty years ago when some regard was paid to the button manufactory Look here too at the cock of this hat and the form of these buckles they were likewise all the mode in the Duke of Marlborough's time and I wish for the sake of my country that some more of the good old customs of that time were still in fashion  SONG  Let young fops and old fools of all ranks combine  To flock like trim jackdaws to Fashion's vain shrine  In such if one moment they're worthy of note  Opinion is only the cut of a coat  For my part I'll steadily stick to one mode  Tho' my fashion is old 'tis English and good  All cure sure our enemies think we are past  Or they never would smuggle their taylors so fast  If things now go wrong that they'll mend where's the chance  When the nation is put in strait waistcoats by France  For my part c  In the days of Queen Bess fine beaux were all seen  With lace ruffs two yards round quill'd under the chin  Then an Englishman dress'd in a style all his own  And the sea was his empirethe globe was his throne  Since this is acknowledg'd I'll stick to my mode  Tho' my fashion is old 'tis English and good  Ang  Tho' my father is your brother Sir you differ very widely in temper from him  Bale  There is an instance in which nature herself did not observe method your father from his childhood had a leaning to extravagance and when the young spendthrift had squander'd away all his pocket money at school I used to advance him a fresh supply at twopence in the halfcrown premium why to this moment I have a particular hour in the day for doing every thing and as the clock strikes my performance chimes echo to the sound of it but here is a curious calculation which I have made that tells me at a glance of the eye how every hour of my life is disposed of for twenty years to come  pulls out a pocketbook  now mark here's the third of August ten in the morning reading the General Evening Post with my remarks upon the siege of Gibraltar  Ang  A ccording to that calculation the siege must last for fifteen years  Bale  Why Troy held out a siege of ten years and I think we have abler engineers in our service than ever king Priam had but pray take notice here I come to the year ninetynine February sixteenth eleven forenoon taking the air if the weather permit if not exercising at the dumb bell to open my chest and give me a freedom of breathing  Ang  Why yes in the year ninetynine you may want something to give you a freedom of breathing  Enter a  SERVANT  Serv  Colonel Mountford's servant is arrived Sir with part of his baggage  Bale  You know the apartments allotted for his mastershew him there and tell the butler to make  much of him    Exit  Servant  Come Angelica pluck up your spirits my girlif I could get you a husband and keep you on this side of the Atlantic how it would astonish your fatherlet me see who have we got in the neighbourhood ods so there's my old friend Dreadnought that served last war under Hawke ecod I believe he sail'd round the world with Anson too  Char  And if you had sailed round the world in search of a husband you cou'dn't have fixt upon such anotherbut Sir tho' you may sport with my happiness and make it subservient to your caprice or your ambition you should consider that you have no such power over my cousin  Bale  I only mean to advisebut I think he's a very good looking man for his ageto be sure you may know by his walk that he has been more used to the quarterdeck than the drawingroomthen perhaps you'll say he's tann'd and has got a few scars in his countenance but these are Valour's credentials and the old Admiral looks the nobler for them  Ang  You may spare yourself the trouble of providing me with a husband for my heart is unalterably engaged to another  The clock chimes quarter past five  Bale  Ods so I'm engaged too there goes the quarter and I'm so much beyond my hour of writing letters  Exit  Ang  Nothing upon earth sure could have been more unfortunate  Char  My heart will not admit a thought of any man but Summers  Ang  As we are acquainted with the state of each other's sentiments why not consult the means of defeating your father's tyranny  Char  I'll immediately acquaint Summers of the danger we are in lend me your cloak  Puts on Angelica's cloak  I'll slip down thro' the garden in case of any enquiry you can easily make an excuse for me  Some step must be taken immediately for this night determines my fate  Ang  Here comes your father again let us get out of his way  They retire  Bale  My good friend I never break in upon my hours if you have any message to deliver to my daughter yonder she goes with her cousin  Carb  Which of the two young ladies is Miss Bale Sir  Bale  That's she without a cloakI must beg your pardondear me this is destructive of all method  Exit  Bale  in a passion  Manet  CARBINE  Carb  Trumpets and kettledrums but she's a fine girl and when she shifts her ground her gait has the majesty of a charger What a park of artillery plays from her eyes what an ambush for Love is that rogueish dimple in her left cheekthe bravest soldier that ever faced the thunders of battle need not be ashamed to tremble at approaching such a breastwork my master to be sure is very much averse to the match at present but I fancy he'll alter his tone when he has seen his mistress her cousin has left her and she moves this way as my orders are to bring a particular account of her person I'll take possession of this post for the advantage of reconnoitering I have not seen so much beauty in all my different quarters tho' I have been in the army since I was the height of a ramrod  ANGELICA  comes on  Ang  This is his servant I'll speak to himAs I take it Sir you are Col Mountford's servant  Carbine  bows very low  Carb  I have that honor Ma'am my ancestors have been in the Colonel's family for more than a century  Ang  Your ancestors friend  Carb  Yes Ma'am I am fourth in the line from the great Oliver Carbine who lost his head in holding  Lord Mountford's stirrup at the battle of Ramillies  Ang  A most respectable descent I must confess I make no doubt then you are a confidential servant  Carb  My master Ma'am never undertakes any thing of consequence without consulting me'tis Carbine what's your opinion or what do you think upon every expedition  Ang  Then tell me I beseech you to be sincere but first as an earnest of my friendship take this  gives him money  don't think I mean to bribe you  Carb  I scorn a bribe Ma'am as much as I value this mark of your Ladyship's generosity  Puts up the money  SONG  You may take a piece of gold  And your conscience ne'er the worse  When the chinkers are not told  From Corruption's venal purse  But a bribe is a thing your Ladyship I know  Were I willing to receive one never cou'd bestow  Should that lilly hand so kind  With goodnature running o'er  To heap favours be inclin'd  For this one I'd take a score  But a bribe c  Ang  How is the Colonel disposed to his approaching marriage  Carb  Madam he thinks time commands a halt every hour till he lays his heart and his laurels at the feet of his mistress  Aside  There can be no harm in that volley of mere powder without ball for he must have no cyes if he does n't like her  Ang  Then I'm undone  Aside  did you never hear him talk of another Lady with any seeming partiality  Carb  No as I hope to be faved Madam  Ang  What did he never speak of one he met by the most extraordinary accident in America  Carb  Oh she was an American Ladynow Ma'am I understand you yes yes I know all about that affair there was an American Lady he often talk'd of and talk'd to and there was a good deal of talk about their conversation but that's all over I give you my word Madam  Ang  What do you mean Sir  Carb  Dear Ma'am young fellows will be young fellows and youth is a soil that yields the better crop for having a little wild oatseed sown in it but the Colonel Ma'am is a man of the strictest honor he has resigned his former commission and now wishes to sight under the banners of an English commander  Ang  I find he has got a most strenuous advocate for his vices  Car  His vices Lord Ma'am how can you call a stray thought especially before marriage by so hard a name for my part I consider these little trips of the fancy in the light of deserters the partial defection of a few from an army is no reproach to the loyalty of the main body oh Ma'am his heart lies in this house  Ang  Every word he utters serves but to plunge me deeper in despair ah wretched wretched Angelica all hope is now vanish'd and you may dedicate what remains to be endured of your joyless life to tears and solitude  Aside  Carb  By all that's unaccountable she's jealous of him already I have often heard of love at first sight but did not think it possible before that jealousy could subsist between two lovers whose eyes had never exchanged a single glance together  Aside  Ang  You have answer'd all my questions friend  Carb  And I hope to your Ladyship's satisfaction  Ang  Oh entirely  Carb  That gives me great pleasure so I humbly take my leave Madam his honor your father told me your wedding was fixed for Thursday I shall wish you joy with all my heart but before I strike  my tent give me leave to assure you Ma'am that you and my master will be the happiest pair in England  Exit  Carbine  Manet  ANGELICA  He has taken me for my cousin all this time Oh heavens what an emotion his parting words have given my heart his master and I " the happiest pair in England" the treacherous illusion shoots with deceitful joy across my heart as some faint taper shews a cavern's gloom or as the lightning's momentary ray reveals the frowning aspect of the night to warn the world of thunder  SONG  How serenely the morning first ope's its meek eye  And looks like an angel with smiles from the sky  Yet ere noon some black tempest with terror shall sound  And the Spring's tender blossom is blown to the ground  Thus it fares with our hopes when love fills the heart  In sunshine they rise and in clouds still depart  But Venus herself never shines in her sphere  Till that mourner the Night bathes her cheeks with a tear  Enter  CHARLOTTE  Ang  You are very soon returned  Charl  The Daemon of Mischance persecutes me this morningI was obliged to turn back for fear of a discovery my father contrary to usage immemorial has left his letters half written and is now reprimanding the gardener for depriving the family of the benefit of the sundial by hiding the plate with oabbageleaves and dried flowertops  Ang  The Colonel's servant has been here since and mistook me for you  Charl  I wish his master would make the same mistake  Ang  I have no right to encourage a glimmering of hope for oh Charlotte he loves you from report  his servant assured me that he burns with impatience to see you  Charl  If there was the smallest foundation for that piece of intelligence the master not the servant would have been the bearer of it I have a month's mind to elope and leave a clear stage to you  Ang  That would be such a mark of friendship  Charl  And such a proof of loveAt all events I'll write to him I don't think it safe to venture out till evening but he must know my situation immediately pressed as I am betwixt a man I adore and one who is my utter aversion  Ang  And the Colonel  Charl  For Heaven's sake don't mention the odious creature's nameI hate the very sound  Ang  Nay Charlotte that's too much  Charl  Oh Madam if you please I'll be in love with him  Ang  Nor that either  Charl  In the name of Perplexity then what am I to do  Ang  There is a middle course a certain barrier betwixt Indifference and Love upon which Friendship erects her temple  Charl  I understand youIf I find he wishes to make me his wife I shall hate him but if he prove true to love and my Angelica I'll wear him like a jewel next my heart  DUET  ANGELICA  and  CHARLOTTE  Bright'ning prospects fill my breast  Peace may soon return again  Life's a chequer'd scene confest  Pleasure oft succeeding pain  Friendship's genial voice is sweet  When with cares of love we pine  But to make the bliss complete  Love and Friendship both be mine  Exeunt  SCENE  a Room at an Inn  Colonel  MOUNTFORD  and  FRIBOURG  discovered  Mountf  I am surprised Carbine is not yet returned  Frih  Sil vous plaint Monsieur if you please me go for him  Mountf  Do you know where to go  Frib  No upon my vord  Mountf  Why that's spoke like a Swiss too pliant not to make a proffer of his services though he can render none  Frib  But if you let me know Monsieur where you send Carbine  Mountf  I have sent him to the house of my fatherinlaw that is to be and the rascal stays as long as if he meant to pass the evening there  Frib  Oh ho votre fatherinlaws that be matter of great consequence en bienAs you tink of marriage is it not fit your head should undergo some reformation  Mountf  There's time enough for that I'm in no great hurry about the matter I assure youI commissioned Carbine to bring me some account of my mistress and her family but charged him not to drop a syllable of my arrival my thoughts are wandering towards another object  Enter  WAITER  Waiter  A gentleman of the name of Summers enquires for Colonel Mountford  Mountf  SummersShew him in    Exit  Waiter  It must be my old friend George whatever has brought him to this part of the world I know no other Summers but himself This is most fortunate to meet a particular friend in a place where I did not expect to find a single acquaintance  Enter  SUMMERS  Sum  Dear Mountford welcome to England I am heartily rejoiced to see you but to meet thus  unexpectedly after an absence of four years gives me as much pleasure as surprise  Mountf  Believe me George neither your pleasure nor your surprise exceed mine upon this occasion But in the name of Wonder what brought you to this quarterHow did you find me but  Sum  In answer to your first question I must tell you that it is now about a twelvemonth since I have succeeded to an uncle's estate down here in Somersetshire and have resided ever since at Bath and in reply to your second I met my old acquaintance Carbine who directed me here to you But you'll not stay any longer at an inn when your friend has a house to accommodate you  Mountf  I am sorry George I can't accept of your invitation but I must go to my fatherinlaw's  Sum  'ZoundsYou are not married too  Mountf  Not yet but I am to be very shortlyI am quite an altered man from what you knew me formerly in London  Sum  Altered indeedWhat the gay sprightly Mountford whom Cupid with all his art could never chain to be at last ensnared by that old dotard Hymen  SONG  Fickle youth thro' the garden of beauty may range  And from fair one to fair one inconstantly change  Like the bee in the bell of the cowslip repose  Steal a kiss from the lilly then wing to the rose  But should Hymen once happen thesspoiler to meet  He compels him for life to enjoy the same sweet  Nor complain of hard fate but imprint on your mind  That true pleasures should be like rich odours confin'd  Mark the drop that distils from a cloud as it crost  If it fall in the sea how for ever 'tis lost  And passion divided like a spark will depart  But when Hymen has six'd it a flame lights the heart  Mountf  The match I am come upon I must own is entirely prudentialBut what would you say to me if I had been downright in love since I left England had doted to excess felt all the pains of the most lively passion and for a woman I never beheld but once  Sum  I am not at all surprised at that the power of beauty is divine and when the stroke comes from Heaven it is no wonder death should ensue instantly But now came this spark to kindle all of a sudden to such a blaze  Mountf  Commanded last year on a secret expedition through the interior part of SouthCarolina I met a woman who at first sight made an impression on me I feel to this hour She was taken prisoner by the French when I had the good fortune to be the instrument of her deliverance but as my orders were to proceed by the most rapid marches I was obliged to quit her nearly in the instant I had rescued her and what is worse before I had an opportunity of knowing who she was  Sum  Did she refuse to tell you her name  Mountf  No but I feared to ask it for you must know there was a gentleman with her who from his attention I took to be her husband then whatever servants she had were dispersed by the engagement or I might have learned her name and place of abode but Fortune was my foe and determined we never should meet So now at my father's earnest request I have quitted the army in order to take a wife he has chosen for me and forget this fair enchantress I have been so long dreaming of  Sum  I commend your prudence much and am happy to find the scene of your matrimonial project is to be in my neighbourhood  Enter  CARBINE  Car  Joy joySir I have seen her and such a charming creature I never beheld in all my marches  Mountf  Then it seems she's handsome  Car  HandsomeSir she's the most liberal lady in England  Mountf  I understand you it is to her liberality she is indebted for this praise of her beautyShe has given this fellow money to make a good report of her    To  Sum  and were she Deformity itself he'd paint her in the colours of an angel  Car  Your Honor wrongs meby the pride of a soldier you doI confess she did force a small present upon me but it was done after such a genteel manner that out of politeness to the lady and respect for your Honor of whom I considered myself the humble representative I could not possibly refuse it  Sum  Come Carbine give some description of her  Car  Imprimis  her person is of the true height neither above or below the mark but right battalion standard  Mountf  The rogue speaks of her as he would of a recruit he had inlisted  Car  I have inlisted many a recruit your Honor and never surveyed one half so nicely  Mountf  Proceed Sir with your description  Car  Pausing  In the second place as to her eyes whether they were black or blue I cannot speak positively but you know either is a good colour Sir and equally bewitching  Mountf  Can't you tell which  Car  No no cannot charge my memory  Sum  This is no great proof Carbine of your having considered the young lady's person so nicely  Car  I beg your Honor's pardon but I could no more look full into a pair of fine eyes at first than I could gaze at the sun in full splendor besides there is a somewhat combustible with your Honor's leave about my own heart and I have known a single spark cause the explosion of a magazine  SONG  Should Love throw a shell  What soldier can tell  On which side the danger may fall  By a glance from the eye  Your poor Carbine may die  As if shot thro' the heart by a ball  When a beauteous maid  With glitt'ring parade  Appears in the blaze of her charms  To resist is in vain  We're ta'en pris'ners or slain

having rejected your proposals Meet me without fail immediately at the garden gate for unless some effectual measures are taken to defeat my father's intentions you must for ever resign all thoughts of your unfortunate CHARLOTTE  What can she possibly meanMy mind will be on the rack till I am satisfied  Mountf  That letter George seems to have made you uneasy  Sum  It has made me most unhappyIt comes from a woman I adore appointing an interview immediately in order I suppose to let me know that she new can be mine  Mountf  'Sdeath man as she continues to correspond with you and grant you private meetings she'll clope if you put her to the trial  Sum  I don't know that  Mountf  You shall make the attempt I am determin'd nay I'll not quit you till I have seen you both whisk off in a

hurricane  Rach  'Tis that which frightens me sowhat cou'd take her out said I such a night Oh that curs'd fish pond at the bottom of the garden  Bale  What do the wench mean  Rach  I wish such a thing as a fish pond was never invented  Bale  I begin to be alarm'd why Rachel sure you don't think any accident has happen'd to her  Rach  I see he's frighted and so I'll punish him  Aside  you know you have been a most cruel father Sir and a disappointment in love will make a woman do any thing  Bale  I shall go distracted if she's not found  Rachel  Then consider what the world will say to you

Angelica I'll go tell her of it this moment  Exit  Rachel  Bale  So then my whole plan is come to the ground henceforward I may pay as little regard to method as my daughter has done in her proceedingsmy calculations toomy cares for a rising generation are all become useless no later than yesterday I made a provision in the army for a youth who tho' he's not yet born I sat down as a general I had likewise married two of my granddaughters to great advantage in the next century but the rebellion of this undutiful girl has clouded all my prospects so that it's probable I shall leave

I was here the house was all chearfulness the doors flew open as if the hinges had life in 'em then I thought the servants all so well bredthe butler in particular is the most of a gentleman perhaps ever presided in a pantry  Mountf  And while I have been assisting my friend Summers to remove his mistress from her father's all this change has happen'd neither my fatherinlaw or my intended bride

remembrance I declare that I owe my freedom to the gallant Mountford  Mountf  There are certain moments in which the mind doubts whether it actually wakes or is only deluded by the phantoms of a vision I am now Madam in that state I remember full well every circumstance of our accidental meeting in America since when your image has never been absent from me but it is with difficulty I credit my senfes when they tell me I behold you in England and oh transporting thought approach you with a claim that makes you mine for ever  Ang  This is exceedingly strange but the Colonel I find as well as his servant takes me for Charlotte shall I undeceive him will it not be cruel now I find he loves meHe will discover his error too soon I fear  Aside  Mountf  How Madam am I to interpret these cold looks With silent eloquence methinks they say though you give me your hand you have not a heart to bestow with it  Ang  That would be ingratitude in the extreme after the service you had render'd me the obligation I owe you Colonel believe me has sunk deep in my heart  Mountf  Still Madam you dwell on the nature of your obligation to me you owe me none when I rescued you from captivity I did no more than my duty as a soldierI cannot will not presume upon a service rendered by accident no Madam nor will I ungenerously take advantage of your father's countenancing my addresses if you do not approve of themThis reserve these embarrass'd looks too plainly declare you can never love me though thro' a false notion of justice you would become the willing sacrifice of an ideal gratitude  Ang  There are certain circumstances Colonel which I cannot conceal  Mountf  I understand you Madamyour affections are fixed on another if so don't consider me as an obstacle to your wishes I'll quit this house tomorrow morning nor ever more trouble you with my addresses  Ang  Generous nobleminded fellow  Aside  It would be cruel Colonel not to set you right in one particular but you may rest assur'd

is an evergreen Sir time has made very little alteration in himBut dear Sir nothing could equal my surprise  Bale  Interrupting the Colonel  I assure you Colonel your surprise could not be greater than mine but you can't suppose I ever dreamt of such a thing when I proposed the match  Mountf  How is it possible you could have expected it  Bale  I must confess it gives me much concern you have

Certainly Sir else why did I come to your hourse  Bale  The night is very dark Colonel  Mountf  The night's very dark and what's that to us  Bale  'Tis no object to be sure as you are bent upon the matterit's very unlucklybut we shan't have full moon these ten days  Mountf  I should suppose we had full moon tonight by your conversation  Aside  Bale  Ah Colonel my daughter has acted a most artful part by meI never discovered how her inclinations were really disposed till just before your arrival  Mountf  And was not that time enough Sir  Bale  Too late by six hours had I the least suspicion of it this morning  Mountf  I am very glad you had not as it might have been the cause of your making unnecessary preparationsMiss Bale's reserve on this occasion is strictly conformable to the natural delicacy of her sex  Bale  The devil take such delicacy  Aside  Mountf  Now I like her the better for it  Bale  You do  Mountf  I do upon my soul I never could be happy with a woman that had not that turn of temper  Bale  Then I am sure Colonel you can't be at a loss for a wife to your mind in these times  Mountf  I told her  Mountf  Yes I have  Bale  Where  Mountf  In this room  Bale  What my

been mistaken for you know we are old acquaintance  Bale  How the devil should I know any such thing  Mountf  I thought she had told you of it  Bale  Never open'd her lips to me on the subject  Mountf  This is truly extraordinaryWhy Sir 'tis now above eight months since I first saw her I never had her out of my thoughts sinceNay Sir as a farther proof of what beauty like hers can do Lieutenant Middleton belonging to my own troop was as much enamour'd at his first and only interview Poor fellow he was trepann'd some time ago for a desperate wound he received a little above the temple and has never since been rightly in his understanding  Bale  It appears to me that some more of the regiment has undergone the same operation  Aside  Mountf  But Sir I am perfectly satisfied with your daughter's reception of meand now as there is no bar in the way of my happiness I'll act with the same freedom as if I was already one of the family I have an old and most particular friend at Bath

made voyages enough in his timethey say he'd make nothing of sailing to the world's end and back again  Carb  But this is a kind of conversation in detachments When cruel creature may I expect that the cartel of Love will bring about an exchange of hearts between us  Rach  Really Sir I think it rather too soon to propose that questionBesides I'd have you to know that I like to be courted as well as my betters and expect to hear a man talk to me of his stames and his darts and write lovesongs on me  SONG  He who'd win my heart must shew  That he doats upon me so  Every thought has left him quite  But to please me morn and night  Sighing still "I burn I die  "In the sunshine of thine eye"  Woman's heart delights to prove  That she conquers man by love  Where is all his boasted pride  When he sits by beauty's side  Sighing still c  Every warbler of the grove  Learns his sweetest note from love  And the youth to beauty dear  Speaks in music to her ear  Sighing still c  Carb  'Sdeath

I have met in the family  Exeunt severally  SCENE  a Parlour in Admiral  Dreadnought's  House  Miss  KITTY DREADNOUGHT  and Mrs  WILMOT  Kitty  Upon my word there is something very prudish in that notion what never marry a second time  Mrs Wil  You misapprehend me I do not censure the practice in others I only say that under the circumstances I found myself left a widow it is impossible I can ever think of a second husband  Kitty  Then you have no family incumbrance like other women for my brother the Admiral out of regard to Captain Wilmot has taken your son under his protection and means to provide for him  Mrs Wil  That is one reason out of many why it appears to me I should not change my condition Is it not to the merit of my deceased husband I owe the favour shewn to my son Is it not to that husband's merit also I am indebted for the asylum I enjoy under your brother's hospitable roof if I could forget all the love I ever bore the dear partner of my heart gratitude says I shou'd not insult the memory of a man whose spirit seems still to attend me like a guardian angel with a fondness that survives the grave  Kitty  Well as my time is to come yet I will not pretend to answer for my conduct when I become a widow inexperienc'd young women often form rash refolutions but marriage makes great changes in us  Mrs Wil  It has often surpris'd me Miss Kitty how it happens that you have remain'd so long single  Kitty  So long Ma'am I don't know what you mean by long unless you think one shou'd marry in a bib and tucker  Mrs Wil  I beg pardon Ma'am I only meant to observe that your many amiable qualities united to your fortune and family entitle you to every notice  Kitty  Lord what can one do with such an out of the way being as my brother who never visits or sees  company above once or twice a year indeed what company is he fit for except such sea bears as himself has he not converted the house into a kind of land man of war doesn't the family go to bed by an evening gun and a'n't all the servants at night slung up in hammocks  DREADNOUGHT  speaking as he enters    Tell the groom to bring me word what trim the saddlehorses are in and bid the coachman make ship ready for a cruise  Kitty  By these orders my brother's going abroad  Enter  DREADNOUGHT  Dreaed  I have just receiv'd a card of compliments inviting you Kitt and the Widow and myself to friend Bale's I understand that his danghter lays her proper course at last and is now bearing down Matrimony roads under flying topsails  Kitty  Then Mr Summers's hopes are all over for I am positive old Bale wou'd never give his daughter to him  Dread  No no poor Summers's hopes are all gone to the bottom the vessel's designed for a commander of quality and I was sorry to hear it for Summers is as honest a fellow as ever broke bisket I wish he'd take you in tow Kitt he shou'd have five thousand down upon the binnacle and as much more when death sets my anchor a peak  Kitty  Lord brother how you confound me  Dread  You are not fresh launch'd to be sure from boardingschool dock but what of that now its the fashion to paint the prow every morning and hang out the colours of all nations in the rigging an old hulk with a sheathing of gold makes such a gingerbread appearance that she'll pass for a new frigate  Mrs Wil  I have just heard from my son William Sir he desires his most respectful duty to his benefactor his second father  Dread  Widow I regard you and I regard your son for the sake of one who is gone upon the voyage  we must all sail without compass or pilot I was lieutenant of the Ruby when he was rated midshipman on the same ship's books from the day he boarded the French firstrate we took off Brazil and killed the Captain and Lleutenant with his own cutlass I said that he'd turn out one of those days a very brave fellow and so he did for when he knew it was his duty to fight he never counted his guns and their smoak prevented him from counting those of an enemy he was always the first to form the line the last out of action and no man cou'd say he ever disobeyed a signal but his heart was oak English oak to the centre and as if my brave friend cou'd never die 'till that part was wounded he was shot thro' it  SONG  Omitted in the representation  Ye gallant souls that beat so high  With England's glory in each vein  From his example learn to die  Whose honor never knew one stain  At break of day two sail appear'd  And on the larboard quarter stood  For action strait the decks were clear'd  Which soon alas was dy'd with blood  My friend maintain'd the th' unequal fight  Till bringing all his guns to bear  With redhot balls their thunder fright  And up one Frenchman blew in air  The other struck her colours now  But oh too late his life to save  For ere the hostile slag was low  A shot had marked him for the grave  Kitty  I can't put poor Mr Summers out of my headI am exceedingly concern'd for him but I do n't suppose he ever thought so much about her as she wou'd fain make the world believe Lord what is she a mere aukward piece of still lifepray widow what's your opinion of Miss Bale  Mrs Wil  She's agreeable but no beauty  Dread  Now I say she is and what's more it will be a long time before she wants the repairs of some folks who find fault with her I have often compared a fine young woman to Old England jealousy raises a combination of powers against both but in spite of all compacts whether female or Bourbon the world will pay due honors to the broad pendant of Beauty and the English Flag  Kitty  Lord brother with what countenance can you pretend to talk of beauty  Dread  Why for that matter Kitty I don't think either of us hang out a good countenance for the subject  Kitty  Speak for yourself  Dread  Your face speak for you  Kitty  Let us go Mrs Wilmot and prepare for the visit he's as rough as his own element  Exeunt Mrs  Wilmot  and Miss  Kitty  Manet  DREADNOUGHT  This woman is in a continual state of mutiny she's harder to govern than a threedecker she kept me in a storm for a long time about my servants but old Cable Dreadnought was moor'd too fast to his opinion I'll have none

decks  Ex  Groom  Oh here comes the coachman  Enter  BOREAS  Bor  I'm surpris'd so fine a seaman as your Honor would venture out tonight  Dread  Why not old Boreas  Bor  The wind sets right in our teeth  Dread  Can't you make the voyage by long tacks  Bor  The worst on't is the gale blows so fresh that I fear my box will go by the board  Dread  Then you had better unship it entirely and steer

me from this house the discovery was made by one of his own servants therefore he wishes to convey me off without the knowledge of any of the family When you knocked at the door I thought it was my father I am not safe a minute here  Mount  I would fain dear Madam make you a tender of my services but what assistance can I lend you stranger as I am in this part of the world Let me seelet me see  Musing  Is there no way by which I can shew at least my good intention An excellent thought has come into my head I'll take her to my fatherinlaw's and introduce her to my dear Charlotte that excellent girl will compassionate her distress and give her a secure asylum    Turns to  Charlotte  If you'll venture yourself Ma'am under my protection I'll conduct you to the house of a young lady who is very shortly to be my wife whose goodness of heart will make her happy in serving you  Char  What shall I do Harriet  Miss Mel  Upon my word I think you had better accept of the gentleman's invitation  Char  But how will Mr Summers know where to find me  Mount  My servant shall wait his returnDo you Carbine stay for Mr Summers let him follow in the chair and conduct him with the greatest secrecy  into my apartment don't if possible let one of the family see him till you have informed me that he is come  Carb  Your Honor may depend upon my conducting the gentleman under safe escort  Mount  Chear up dear Ma'am you shall soon be in a place of safety  Exeunt  Manet  CARBINE  My master is devilish gallant tonightWhen I found him so wonderfully taken with his mistress nothing ran in my head but a warm kitchen fireside and the smoking hot prospect of a good supperThen to be obliged to strike my tent and march at a moment so criticalI had just opened my first battery against the heart of the chambermaid a fine sprightly wench of eighteen with a soft rolling blue eye that sends every glance like a shot from a riflebarrelIt was curs'd unlucky to be obliged to raise the siege when I saw the Governor preparing to send out a flag of truce to surrender the garrison  SONG  A soldier's life is always sweet  In every town a fair we meet  The martial drum and gay cockade  Is sure to win each village maid  To distant climes with him she'd go  And brave each toil and threat'ning foe  But this the soldier's rule should be  Love still the fairyet still be free  Tho' beauty boasts of pow'rful charms  More fatal far than hostile arms  From ambush tho' the fair rush on  Yet never let the soldier run  Bold as a lion let him prove  The sallies of impetuous love  For ever this his rule should be  To love the fairyet still be free  Enter  SUMMERS  followed by two Porters with a Chair  Sum  Come get into the chair immediately Why she's gone  Looking round with surprise  Carb  Yes Sir she's gone with my master to a place where you may be sure her father will never dream of seeking her and I was left behind to conduct you there  Sum  Oh I am satisfied since she's with my friend but has there been any alarm in my absence to occasion this sudden departure  Carb  A devil of an alarm it seems the poor lady was frighten'd out of her witsBut come Sir get you into the chair and for fear of accidents draw the curtains close about you  Summers  goes into the chair    I'll march on before and be the vanguard to protect your Honor in the trenches  Exeunt  SCENE  changes to  BALE's  House  Enter  ANGELICA  Ang  What upon earth can have become of this Colonel He left the house abruptly and nobody can tell where he is gone to or when he will return Does this behaviour correspond with the passionate declaration he made to me of love His words and actions are downright contradictions  Enter Mrs  WILMOT  Mrs Wil  My dear Ma'am I am under the greatest anxiety for you have you heard from Miss Bale yet  Ang  I expect Rachel with news every moment  Mrs Wil  I wish Ma'am it were in my power to assist you with more than my good wishes  Ang  My dear Mrs Wilmot it is assisting me materially to have a person in whom I can repose a confidence  Mrs Wil  Suppose I break the matter to the Admiral and strive to gain him over to your interest  Ang  That's a forlorn hope indeedMy uncle proposed him to me for a husband and but for Charlotte's elopement I should have had the old Admiral  before this time breathing out his passion in full gales at my feet  Mrs Wil  You don't know Ma'am my good friend's character was he even in love with you and afterwards told of the mutual attachment between you and the Colonel he would take a pride in resigning his pretensions  Ang  I should not like to trust him  Mrs Wil  He is the true English seaman rough as the element on which he once fought the battles of his country but there is a tenderness of heart and a greatness of soul about him not always found under a more polished outsideHe is a stranger to dissimulation himself and abhors it in othersBut indeed I have often observed that the manners of British seamen are peculiar to themselves as if there was something that mended the heart and purified the mind in the very air of the ocean  Ang  A propos  here he comesI thought he had been gone out with my uncle  Mrs Wil  Suppose then I speak to him  Ang  I'll speak for myself there is a better thought than yours come into my head  Mrs Wil  Then I'll leave you together but remember the character I have given you of him  Exit Mrs  Wilmot  Manet  ANGELICA  Ang  Now Cupid take the sharpest arrow from your quiver and convert it into a harpoon to strike this Leviathan in love for me  Enter  DREADNOUGHT  Dread  I have

Ang  Make a prize of it you should say Admiral  Dread  If such a prize had fallen into my hands all the jewels in the salt seas should not ransom it from me  Ang  Hold hold Admiral there are many captures made which do not turn out upon trial to be good prizes  Dread  That's very true Ma'am but when there is any foul play in the case the vessel is discharg'd at Doctors Commons  Ang  If I should listen to your professions how can I be certain that you are sincere  Dread  How do I know what degree of Latitude I am in by taking an observation of the sun when it is in the meridian  Ang  Man is well express'd by the sun before marriage but I'm of opinion the moon has more to do with him afterward did you never take an observation of that planet  Dread  I don' know how it is Ma'am but this conversation appears to me a kind of traverse sailing and then a woman trims so sharp she always gets the weather gage of me  Ang  You promise then to be constant  Dread  As the needle to the north  Ang  But marriage may prove an approach too close and when that happens marriners report that there is always a great variation  Dread  Madam your wit enables you to fire two broadsides to my one then let me aim a shot ever so well it does no manner of execution for want of strength in my powder having obliged me therefore  to drop astern I wish to know before I sheer off whether I shall ever hoist my flag on board of the America  Ang  Why Admiral my marriage depends entirely upon that of my cousin  Dread  Prithee how  Ang  I made a solemn promise never to give my hand to any man till she was disposed of to Mr Summers and here I make another promise never to marry at all if she's weded to the Colonel  Dread  That bears very hard upon me  Ang  It does not singly Sirmy resolution is fix'd Oh that odious Colonel it is he who has caus'd all our confusion I am told that he has declared he will not leave the house without a wife  Dread  Say you so I'll try himI'll send him a challenge and make him eat his words or he shall blow old Cable out of the water  Ang  Not for the world so precious do I hold your life that to preserve it I'd even break my promise and marry him myself  Dread  And leave me to founder I tell you what Ma'am I'll make him an offer of my sisterHe can't want a wife more than she wants a husband to my knowledge she has been these twenty years heaving out the lead but never cou'd get into proper soundings  Ang  Do you think he'll have her  Dread  If he wants a wife so much he will  Ang  Well do any thing but challenge him try once more your influence with my uncle 'twill break my heart if Charlotte's marriage with the Colonel shou'd oblige me to deny you  Exit  Angelica  Manet  DREADNOUGHT  Old and season'd as my own heart is such an

vessel Cable fitter for a guardship than a convoyAn old man of war may lie safe enough at the Nore under doble anchors and so may I at Bachelor'sPoint with a single hauser but should either of us part from our stations and the land squalls freshen why we may drive up in distress to Gravesend and ground thereMarriage is avoyage round the world a man must expect to meet with all weathers before he

lights immediately  Exit  Mountford  Manet  CHARLOTTE  Char  This gentleman though a stranger to me is Summers's friend and as such I have relied on him Perhaps it was imprudent to accept of his protection without knowing him better but my fears deprived me of all reflectionI have one comfort however to think it is better being taken any where than home again  Reenter  MOUNTFORD  with Lights  Mount  For fear of discoveries you see Ma'am I have brought the lights myselfand now I'll go for my dear Charlotte  Exit  Mountford  Char  His dear CharlotteI find this lady and I are namesakes  Looks round her with astonishment  Can I credit my sensesWhy he has brought me to my own houseWhat madness to put myself in the power of an utter stranger This man has been suborn'd by my father and under pretence of friendship for Summers has betrayed meWhat shall I doWhich way shall I turn me to shun the  ruin hanging o'er my headThere is no way of avoiding it I resign myself to my fate  Throws herself in a chair and appears buried in despondency  ANGELICA  and  MOUNTFORD  appear behind  CHARLOTTE  at the upper end of the Stage  Ang  Who in the world can he have got with him  Mount  She is belov'd by that friend I esteem most upon earth and as such I beg you wou'd consider her  Ang  Your recommendation Colonel would go a great way towards winning my esteem for any body but one of my own

Mountford  Ang  He himselfby whatever wonderful turn of chance you came into his power  Char  I scarcely know myselfall I can tell you is that I saw him in Summers' company supposed him his friend and put myself under his protection  Ang  Then your being brought here was a plot concerted between this man and your father  Char  Don't you perceive it  Ang  Too plainly for my happinessand yet when I consider the matter more maturely I am half inclined to think he did not know youyou remember his servant already took me for you and he himself to the last moment addressed me by the name of Charlotte  Char  Grant that he might for some time have been under a mistake of that nature don't you imagine that my father has long since undeceiv'd him no it was a deep laid scheme to impose on the credulity of poor Summers  Ang  If your suspicions be well founded he is the most accomplished of Hypocriteswhen he recommended you just now to my protection his words his every look breathed nothing but sincerity and compassion  Char  The villain who wears his purpose in his face will be shunned he must sheath his dagger in a smile before he can wound with it  Ang  Oh that every heart was like mine a stranger to dissimulation Why is the countenance made a mask for the soul when it should be a mirror in which every eye might behold the true features of the mind in the deformity of vice or the loveliness of virtue  Char  Now all's over here he comes with my father  Bale  Without  I tell you Colonel you are deceiv'd it is not possible  Enter  BALE  and  MOUNTFORD  the former appears astonished seeing  CHARLOTTE  Bale  Eh my eyes are none of the best but if there be any dependance on them that is my daughter Charlotte  Char  Now Angelica what do you think of the honour of your

take notice of the other young lady in company with Miss Bale  Bale  Certainly I did  Mount  Have you any objection to her continuing in the family a few days  Bale  Objection Zounds what objection can I possibly have  Mount  Why tobe sure Sir you can have no reasonable objection and yet it's not one man in a thousand who wou'd be so indulgent  Bale  Indulgent do you call it Damme if I'd bid her quit my house if she chose to remain in it these twenty years  Mount  Shaking him by the hand  Truly Sir this is very kind very kind of you indeed and be assured I shall ever gratefully remember the obligation  Bale  Upon my word this is very pleasant But seriously Colonel do you think it such a favour that I permit my niece to continue in the house with her cousin  Mount  What then she's your niece  Bale  Only my brother's daughter  Mount  Oh the devil I have made a charming blunder to bring a woman who had eloped to the house of her uncleI might as well have brought her to her father's  Aside  Enter  CARBINE  Carb  A word in your ear Sir  Carb  and  Mount  retire to the back of the stage  Bale  I am so perplex'd with false appearances on every side that I cannot distinguish between the shadow and the substance Well if Charlotte did elope it is evident the Colonel knows nothing of the matter and it's not my business to undeceive him there is something very extraordinary in all this and yet there may be method in it if I cou'd find it out  Coming forward  Mount  Go warn him instantly of his danger  Exit  Carbine  Enter  SERVANT  Serv  Sir Mr Summers is in the house  Bale  Summers what a piece of assurance  Mount  Don't be angry with him Sir for he never wou'd have come here if I had n't suggested the scheme  Bale  O then this was a scheme of your suggesting  Mount  Entirelyand as he has taken up his quarters with you I hope you won't drive him out of the garrison  Bale  There are certain quarters in Moorfields that I think will become your garrison  Aside  Mount  Come come Mr Bale you must be poor Summers's friendnay I insist upon itIf you knew how many good qualities he possessed by Heaven you wou'd regard him as a son  Bale  Zounds wou'd you wish that he was my son  Mount  I wish he was your nephew  Summers  Without  I insist upon admittance  Enter  SUMMERS  Sum  Mr Bale you may think it extraordinary to see me in your housebut do not attribute my presence to either disrespect or any intention of injury before I came here I was trepann'd by a false friend  Points to  Mountford  Bale  Damme if I don't think you both were  trepan'd  Mount  Was it

 Mount  For whom  Bale  For my daughterwhom this good friend of your's was endeavouring to steal away from you  Mount  He pretended love to your niece  Bale  That was all a pretence to impose upon you  Mount  Dare you maintain to my face Summers that it is to the daughter of this gentleman your pretensions aspire  Sum  Dare II never will resign my claim to her but with my life  Mount  Then you shall win her at the hazard of that lifeDraw thou dishonour to the name of friend  Sum  Ay this is acting the villain with consistency  Both draw and fight  Enter  ADMIRAL  Adm  What friends and

even so Sirbut I hope it was not to a  name  that you have been making so many passionate professions  Mount  Madam your beauty your accomplishments have rivetted fetters upon my heart no earthly power can break asunder  Bale  Though matters are not taking the turn I could wish there is something like the appearance of method at lastWell Colonel as there can be no more mistakes let me introduce you to the real Charlotte who is to be your wife  Mount  I beg leave to withdraw my claim Sir in favor of my friend Summers who I hope is now convinc'd I never entertain'd a thought of

fine young fellow with a good fortune is looking out for the fair wind of your consent to marry your daughterFriend Bale for a long time I have had a great regard for you but I am sorry to remark that in this case you have put to sea more with a view to making a prize than doing the duty which honor requires of youSome fathers treat their children as if they were trafficking in gold dust and elephants teeth and had forgot that the slave trade was abolished in England  Bale  Takes  Dread  aside  Between ourselves Admiral as my daughter went off with him and this Colonel won't have her I should have no objection to giving my consent only I am afraid I shall lose my character for ever by it as a man of method  Dread  But you'll gain a point in the other course and establish your character as a man of understanding  Bale  Well Summers as Charlotte appears determin'd to have nobody but you I'll let the Colonel see he shan't overturn all my calculationsYou shall have my daughter
