Bath  Miss Wing  Mr Henry Samson Woodfall  Josiah Wedgwood  Esq  Y  Mr Joseph Younger  PREFACE  I AM well aware that some of the earliest Letters to be met in this Collection will at first Glance appear too trivial for Publication and that Persons who limit their Perusal to them will be apt to pronounce unfavourably of the whole I therefore think it necessary to assign my Reasons for including them and at the same Time give a short Account of the Work in general  These Letters are truly what they are announced in the Titlepage  Genuine  The Lady to whom they were written entrusted me with the Publication On my first Perusal of them I thought they contained Matter much too good to be lost The moral Lessons wherewith they abound being chiefly calculated for younger Minds I took the Liberty in my Proposals to recommend the Work as a  proper Companion to the Time of Education in both Sexes Those Letters which contain Critiques on many celebrated Writers appeared to me not unworthy the Notice of Men of Reading and Erudition I revised and transcribed those on  Homer  in particular with the Original and  Pope  's Translation at my hand and can at least venture to affirm there is a great Deal of  New  in Mr  Preston  's Remarks I declare with great Truth that I have his Reputation at Heart more than my own Emolument and therefore hope for his Sake my weak Judgment may not be called in Question  My Motive for retaining those initiatory Letters which seem less consequential were partly in hope that they might have the same good Effect on other Pupils which they had on his It may be objected that they contain Rules which are to be found in every French Grammar Granted But to use a Maxim of our Writer's may not a Precept or two scattered in this light epistolary Manner have more Force than all the formal Documents that ever were penned What has been may be I am a Witness that his Pupil  profited excellently by this Mode of Instruction I therefore think the Insertion of them cannot be wholly useless beside that it gives an Opportunity of admiring that kind and easy Pliancy with which a Man of Learning and Genius descended to the Level of a puerile Comprehension  I lament that it has not been in my Power to obtain a Sight of the young Lady's Letters We have her Tutor's Word for her being possessed of good Sense and a Quickness of Apprehension Her Remarks therefore could not but be entertaining if not instructive inasmuch as they came pure and genuine from the Heart unsophisticated with casuistical Reasonings or Pedantry of Expression He frequently mentions the Pleasure her Letters afford him unfortunately they are all wanting she had the Affliction to lose her Friend and Instructor when he was many Miles distant from her and all Attempts to recover his Papers proved fruitless  To account for the endearing Terms in which the Tutor sometimes addresses his Pupil be it known he was her  GodFather    and his unremitted Attention to the Improvement of her Mind demonstrates how conscientiously he regarded that important Office he undertook at her Baptism which is too often by the Generality of Mankind as iniquitously neglected as it inconsiderately assumed  For the Gratification of such Readers as wish to be more nearly acquainted with Mr  Preston  I have prevailed on the Lady to sketch his Character which I hereunto subjoin  I have little more to say I mean to give an useful Work to the Publick Should I fail in my Judgment my Intention at least is good and however weak my Abilities may be I have this comfortable Reflection that they are dedicated to a  moral Purpose  to which Important End I wish that all my little Labours should conduce as most suitable to my Inclination and most consistent with my Profession  LETTER To the EDITOR  YOU ask me for a Character of my rever'd Mr  P  You tell me I must hasten for that the Publication is in great forwardness Alas what a Task have you given me already have I suffered extreme Pain on a Reperusal of his Letters which since his Death I have never dared to look into till you encouraged me by saying they might be of the same Service to others which they had once been to me Flattered by this Opinion I ventured to read them again all my Affection all my Gratitude all my Respect awakens but all embittered by the Recollection of my Loss he lives and dies to me again on this Review of what I owe to him I am now less equal to the Task you require of me than I was when I first delivered the Papers to your Hands I then deferred writing  what you wished through a Consciousness of Incapacity and a Shame at delivering my Sentiments intentionally to the Press That Consciousness that Shame is now absorbed in my Fears for the sacred Reputation of my beloved Teacher what will an idle a dissipated Public say of these valuable Letters Should they be treated with Scorn or even Disrespect I shall never forgive myself Is it not possible that Persons without a Tythe of his Understanding his Education or his Virtue will set themselves up for Condemners of his Sense his Literature and his Morals Have not I trespassed on the Duty I for ever owe his Memory in running such a Risque My Motive must be my Apology and if the Departed know any thing of the Actions of Survivors he will know I mean but to pursue his own Plan of doing as extensive Good as my Power will let me To that Public who will shortly receive them I can only say the favoured Individual to whom they were addressed owes all the little Merit you and her other partial Friends have ever ascribed to her under Heaven to the Lessons she received from the Author of these Letters naturally petulant  capricious obstinate he knew with happy Art how to turn even her Failings to Account and skillfully used even the  Curvings  of her Temper as Instruments to the Improvement of her Mind The Letters truly are what you have announced them Genuine the Writer was a Gentleman of an antient and honourable Family once of affluent Fortunes the Name you have adopted in lieu of his own indicates the Misfortune of his Life He was accounted a Man of the first Sense among Men of Sense his Education was compleat his Literature deep yet polished his Taste nice yet not  cavillous  if I may use the Word his Wit was as sound as his Judgment and as sweet as his Manners his Humour was infinite and harmless as it was pleasant This was his Character from Men of Standard Judgment for it is not to be supposed that  I  at any Time could be capable of understanding this Part of it much less at Sixteen at which Age I had the Unhappiness to lose him but what I have repeated is no more than I have heard often asserted by Persons of established Reputation for Skill in what they spoke of But his Heartto describe that is  properly  my Province Yet how shall I be equal to it Pious as a primitive Christian Chearful in the same Degree he was pious Benevolent in the most extensive Sense of the Word Beneficent as far as a limited Power would let him Mild in his Censures Strict in his Actions Charitable in Thought Word and Deed Merciful even to an Infect Kind not only in Intention and Act but his very Address was Kindness pourtrayed yet was he to use his own Words speaking of Mrs K  very resentful if he conceived himself slighted  A strong Trait of his Character was the Pliancy with which he yielded to his fallen Fortunes and the  un  yielding Spirit with which he supported an Independence in despight of them If it would not appear too fanciful I should say he united in his Temper the poetical Descriptions of the Ivy and the Oak The Misfortune hinted at owing to Education and the Principles of his Family early imbibed in the youthful Part of his Life depriving him of the Means of providing for a Family equal to their Birth and his Spirit kept him a single Man my Father and himself involved  in the same Cause and the same Consequences were the most intimate Friends he prevailed on Mr P to take Charge of me as a GodChild an Office he held so sacred that he never took it on him but for me and from that Time he looked on me as his own and I'm sure felt all the Affection of a Father for me nor did I ever feel the Loss of one my own dying while I was an Infant till I lost him  Thus have I endeavoured to fulfil your Request and be assured that neither my Affection or my Gratitude have impelled me to flatter the Character of a Man whose Worth exceeds the Power of Words That the precious Deposit I have committed to your Care may meet with such a Reception as the Gentleness of your own Heart and the Goodness of your Intention induces you to think it will is at present the most fervent Wish  of Dear Sir c  P S  Such of your Readers as are inclined to judge liberally will allow for the Plainness of the Style in a Correspondence with a Girl from seven Years old to sixteen He strove to be plain in order to be  quicker understood and the rather as some of his Subjects are abstruse but the Definition the Illustration the Lesson the Sentiment the Moral are equally good as if dressed in a more lifted Style they may be considered as Mr P himself says of  Creech  's  Horace  a wholesome Pill without any Gilding  GENUINE LETTERS  LETTER I Mr PRESTON to Miss NANCY BLISSET  Dear Nancy  I WAS just now at your Mama's who was gone out so I don't know how you got to W or whether she has heard from you  It is to be remembered here that the Pupil was at this Time just turned ten Years of Age which accounts for the Tutor's descending in his Stile to the Comprehension of a Child    I send you here enclosed a Craftsman  There was at the Time of this Correspondence as great a Contest between high Party and low Court and Country as we have now between Majority and Minority This excited the young Lady's Curiosity which it was the Tutor's Rule never to thwart He hoped also to turn this Curiosity to Account and by feeding her Vanity give her a Taste for History particularly that of her own Country  All the political Papers of this Day are but indifferent however I would not be worse than my Promise besides the Articles of News may divert you  Pray let me know if you got safe to the Country and if you had any Adventures by the Way  He wished to give her a Habit of making Observations and Reflections on every Occurrence to prevent Things sliding off her Mind and by encouraging her to transmit them to Paper help her to develope her own Ideas and form a Stile  worth noticing Be sure to write to me Give my humble  Service to your Aunt How does she do  I allow you to write the first Letter you send me in English if you please I shall write you in French the next Time and send you an Exercise  I am  dear Nancy  your affectionate Friend J PRESTON  London  July    LETTER II  Ma chere Nannette  J'AY receu votre Lettre par le Poste d'Hier mais c'est sans Datte Je vais toute à l'heure en Campaigne où je  resterai jusqu'à Mardi A mon Retour je vous marquerai les petits Defauts dans les Traductions que vous avez fait En general elles sont fort bonnes et je les ay lû avec beaucoup de Plaisir  It was Mr P's constant Method to use more Praise than Blame since from the Turn of his Pupil's Disposition he found he got Credit for the latter in Proportion as he bestowed the former and she generally stopped short if she found the Balance on the wrong Side    Faites mes Compliments à Madame S J'ay donné votre Lettre à votre Mere  Je suis votre très sincere Ami J PRESTON  A Londres  ce    de Juilett    LETTER III  Dear Nancy  I Have the Pleasure of yours of the th current I have not yet got Time to look into the Translation to see if it is done right  Pray translate the enclosed Passage  A Passage from the English Telemachus to be rendered into French  not at once but take two or three different Times to do it in and study it well for the French is very nice which I shall send as soon as you have finished the Translation  Why do you begin Words with a small that ought to be begun with a  great Letter Pray learn to write in a fashionable Way  Give my hearty Service to your Aunt We have no News  Je suis tous jours  ma chere Nannette  votre Ami très affectioné  This little Mixture of the Languages in one and the same Letter is frequently repeated and seems purposely done to make Instruction sit lighter on his Pupil and coax her rather than compel her into Learning and undoubtedly proves the Tutor's Knowledge of human Nature See a Sketch of her Disposition given in the Notes on the last Letter  J PRESTON  July    LETTER IV  Dear Nancy  I Have sent you the Original of your two Translations There are Differences between them that I don't think much of but pray observe the Nicety  of the French in using the Pronouns  du dela de en  and so forth Observe too that you use the singular for the plural and sometimes the plural for the singular You will fall eternally into this Error unless you will fix the Conjugations of Verbs in your Head Pray examine the Translation by the Original Word by Word and study the Reasons of their Difference by this Means you shall become more a Mistress of the French in six Weeks than you have been in all all your Time hitherto The Leisure the Country affords and the little Avocation you have there afford an excellent Opportunity for this  Why do you say I set you long Tasks I do not I bid you take Time and don't fatigue yourself Perform them à deux ou trois reprises ou a combien vous le voulez mais ayez garde de les faire tous jours soigneusement  I design to translate for your Use the History of  Nonchalante Babellarde  and  Finette  not only for the sake of the French but for your Conduct in Life They deserve to be got by heart and printed deep in your Memory though they seem to be written only for young Children  This is another Instance of the Tutor's Knowledge of human Nature this little Compliment thus judiciously thrown in serves at once to encourage her and to excite her farther Emulation it is also a Proof that whatever Book she read he always directed her Search towards the Moral  yet they contain a most excellent  Moral When you are going to do or say something that you are in doubt if it ought to be said or done consider whether it will be like  Nonchalante  or  Babellarde  or  Finette  But I am afraid that you will begin to think I am a  Babellarde  so I conclude in assuring you that few People love you better than dear Nancy  Your faithful Friend J P  Faites mes Compliments à Madame votre Tante  London  July    P S  I don't wonder at the great Difference between your Translation and the Original in  Telemaque  because the English is so different from the Original but you'll observe the real Faults I herewith send another Test of your Abilities  LETTER V  Dear Nancy  I Received yours of the th which is worse Writing than any of your former Letters You don't point out the Place in  Telemaque  from which you took the second Translation in yours but I can scarcely read it You have so strong an Inclination to write the initial Letters of your Name small that you do it always to your Mama and to me sometimes namely in your last  I observe with Pleasure a good deal of the Genius and true Turn of the French Language in your Letters and Translations but you neglect the most common Things namely the Spelling  the Construction and Regimes des Verbes Pray dear Nancy correct that and learn to dispose your Letter in a handsome Manner  You translate too much at a Time Do a little at once and do it well Take more Care of your Writing and learn to point  I go to the Country this Afternoon and return on Monday when I expect to find one from you  Vous etes trop empressée ma Fille d'ecrire beaucoup à la fois Ecrivez moins et avec plus de Soin Faites mes Compliments à Madame votre Tante et soyez persuadé que  Je suis votre fidelle Ami J PRESTON  A Londres  ce    de Juillet    P S  Je vous envoyerai une Critique sur votre derniere Lettre dans la mienne de Lundi Encore je suis à vous  LETTER VI  Dear Nancy  I Have been out of Town since Saturday At my Return I got your Letter but it is neither dated nor pointed I am glad to find the Spirit of the French Language in your Letters and Translations and they grow better every Time you write but as I told you before you neglect the Modes Tenses Numbers Construction and Regimen which are as it were the very Rudiments of the Language Then you write with so heavy a Hand that one would think  you rather used a Gravingiron than a Pen  I have sent you on the other Side of this Sheet your Translation of the last Task I set you with the Original opposite to it I would have you my dear consider it Word by Word not only for the GrammarPart but likewise to learn the true Idiom of the French and the Difference of that from the English I shall only trouble you with one Example  We  say "He put his Affairs in good Order" The  French  say "He put a good Order to his Affairs" You'll see in your Translation you have followed the English Idiom  Be it remembered and allowed for in the Midst of all these Idioms that Mr P being a Scotchman falls into many Idioms even in his own English    I shall continue this Subject in my next In the mean time I assure you that your Letters give me very great Pleasure  Adieu ma chere Nannette  Je suis votre c J P  London  Aug    P S  I send you another Task which I have translated nearer to the French Idiom than the former that it may be the easier run into French when you undertake it  Faites mes Compliments a Madame votre Tante  Encore une sois adieu  LETTER VII  London  Aug    My dear Nancy  MY last was by Thursday's Post I received yours Yesterday in which you excuse the Faults of your Translations by pleading that they are not committed through Carelessness but surely you don't look into your Grammar else you would spell more correctly and observe the Differences of the Numbers and Tenses better  Your Letters and Translations give me great Pleasure there is something so much of the French Turn in them  They are only the most common Things which you oversee You spell  English as well as a Man of Learning does and much better than the most Part of your Sex I would have you as perfect at spelling French I don't expect that your Translations should be equal to the Original How can that be when the Translation that I send you and which you are to render again into the Original is so widely different from the Original itself But then I would have you observe the Difference nicely as it would make a lasting Impression on your Mind I would have you make some Paper up in different Folds then write your own Phrase on one Side and the French Original on the other if the Difference is worth noticing for instance in this Manner  You say Le soin de sa famille lui chagrina le plus  The Original Ce que l'inquietoi  le plus c'etoit le soin de sa famille  Yours is not bad French but then the other is better If you'll take this Method it will infix the most proper and elegant Expression deep in your Mind  I shall detain you no longer having many Letters to write I have enclosed another Paper than I used to send you though it bears the same Name because it is more diverting than the former I shall set you no Task today for I would not chuse to oppress you I am just going to your Mama's that if she thinks fit she may add a Postscript  The Weather is not more uncertain than the Rumours we have of Peace and War  Adieu ma chere Nannette  Je suis à vous c c J P  P S  You should add now and then a Postscript to your Mother for you should not be guilty of so much as the Appearance of Neglect to her  LETTER VIII  London  Aug    Dear Nancy  I Received yours of the th instant I am charmed with the Translation It is the best you have done and much better than I expected It is impossible  that it can be so good French as that of so great a Master as  Mons Perrault  but by setting them in Opposition you see the Difference and if you will mind it and keep the Copies that you may have recourse to them on occasion I do not know a better Way to attain to the Purity of the French Language  In your Letter you say "La Consideration de cela que vous  faire  pardonner c" instead of "que vous  fait  pardonner" and so on in many Instances using the Infinitive for the Imperfect of the Indicative Mood "Ma Tante vous  faire  les Compliments" for vous  fait  " These Mistakes are so obvious that nothing but Carelessness  She has endeavoured to exculpate herself from the Charge of Carelessness yet here she is again arraigned for it Probably she was unconscious of it She did not mean to be inattentive and was only hurried on by early Warmth and wished if possible to attain the Essence of Learning without the necessary Forms that lead to it Such Instances are not uncommon  can make you fall into  them Vous ne devez pas vous pleindre de peu de Capacité parceque vous l'avez belle et bonne et vous en etes bien redevable à Dieu  You should carefully remark the principal Differences between the French and English Manner of Speech This is what we call different  Dialects  It is impossible to enumerate them they are so many but the greatest arise out of these Particles  ou en du des de  c When we would say A thing is generally reported we use this indefinite Expression "It is said" or "They say" The  French say "On dit" We say "At that time" They say "Du temps" We say  "In Europe"  They say "Of  Europe"  We say "I have got a Fever" They say "A Fever has taken me" Then the Use of  à  or  de  before the Infinitive is very hard to be distinguished without great Care as you will see by comparing the last Translation with the Original In like Manner the Difference is difficult between  en  and  dans  when the Adverb  ne  is to be used and when not We say "He is richer than you think c" The French say "He is richer than you don't think" Then we have an auxiliary Verb which they want and which adds great Force and Energy to our Expression on some Occasions and that is the Verb  do  When we aver a  Thing with Vehemence we say "I  do  say soI  do  think so" This is much stronger than to utter simply "I say soI think so" You may observe the Force of this auxiliary  do  in many other Expressions  Nannette  adieu jusqu'à Jeudi et faites mes Compliments à Madame votre Tante  J P  P S  I shall defer sending you your last Translation and  Perrault  's Original till Thursday  LETTER IX  London  Aug    Dear Nancy  ON the other Side you have your Translation and on the next the Original Pray mark the Difference  for though yours is much better than I expected yet you'll find in the other a shorter Way of Expression My Trans  ation which was impossible to be made  iterally from the French has occasioned a greater Difference between yours and the original French than would have been otherwise Besides though you sometimes use Words different from the Author that is nothing your Words have the same Meaning  You'll observe you sometimes mistake  he Gender I shall only notice two In  tances  You  say "Rien de si  indolente  u'etoit  Nonchalante"  The  Author  says Rien de fi indolent your Mistake is you  hink  indolent  agrees with  Nonchalante  nd therefore you put it in the Feminine  Gender but it agrees with  rien  and so should have been in the Masculine  The next thing is you say "Le même Longeur du Temps" This is a stiff Expression besides it is an Anglicism  We  say "The same Length of Time" but the  French  say "Assez long Temps" Moreover this Expression is so natural and usual that I wonder you endeavoured to find out another  I have no more Faults to find only in the Spelling but the Translation is so well in the main that I will send you some little Present for it  I hope to hear from you tomorrow how you like Baron  Tomlison  's Speech  Inserted in a Craftsman  You have never acknowledged the Receipt of any of those Papers  Adieu ma chere Nannette jusquà Samedy  J P  LETTER X  London  Aug    Dear Nancy  I HAVE the Pleasure of yours of the th instant which is still better than any of the former only you forget to spell aright You say  Vous me traiter  instead of  Vous me traitez Ceci vous trouverai  instead of  Ceci vous trouvera  The French is exceeding well but observe you write "J'ay receu chaque Papier vous m'avez envoyé" This  is an Anglicism for we say "I have received every Paper you sent me" instead of "every Paper  that  you sent me" but the French do not so it should have been "Chaque Papier  que  vous m'avez envoyé  I have not been abroad since Saturday being confined to the House by a great Cold I have sent you on the other Side the rest of  Babillarde  's Character I want to know how you do and how you pass your Time  Mr Preston among his other Attentions to his favourite Scholar used much to endeavour at impressing on her Mind an Idea of the  Value of Time  and wished her to be continually employed Sports and Recreations he called Employments in their turn especially when earned by Application to more serious Affairs but  sheer Idleness  he used to say in the Scottish Dialect  the human Mind should think shame of  which you may write in English and at Length  When I can go abroad I shall remember what I promised Your following Tasks shall be shorter than the former that you may consider them well and not be hurried in point of Time I am with my hearty Service to your Aunt ma chere Nannette  à vous J P  P S  You'll observe that the Translation herewith sent is very near the French Idiom This I did to make it more easy for you When you return to Town I would have you try to put these Translations into more proper English We come next to the Character of  Finnette  which I shall divide into three small Tasks à sin que vous vous en acquittier à votre Aise et avec Plaisir  LETTER XI  London  Aug    Dear Nancy  I HAVE the Pleasure of yours of the th and shewed it to your Mama who was writing to you in the mean Time but I suppose her Letter don't reach you till this Night  You certainly do not remark the Differences between the Original and your Translation or you would not fall so often into Faults which are so obvious You frequently mix Substantives and Adjectives of different Genders together and Nouns and Verbs of different Numbers I have reproved you twice for that word  mis  which you use both in  the singular and plural Number and yet you have it twice in the last Translation  I remarked to you formerly that you used the perfect Time when the imperfect was more proper and if you had but compared the Original with your own Translation you would have found it as I said You are to observe as I told you before when you speak of a particular Thing done some time ago you should use the perfect but when you speak of a Thing usually done the imperfect For Example  "Elle mettoit l'Ordre dans la Maison du Roi" That is she  used  to do it But when it is only a peculiar Action done  once  or at a  certain  Time  "Elle mit l'Ordre" c  Observe also that they do not use the Word  avec  in  France  in so extensive a Sense as we do  with  in  England  What we translate into  with  is sometimes à sometimes  de  in French  As the true Idiom of a Language is generally the last Point which is learned and requires a greater Degree of Comprehension than is necessary for understanding a plain grammatical Rule I hope this Passage will not be deemed too trifling to have been retained It is possible that a young Mind might receive a deeper Impression from meeting a Rule thus in the Course of a Letter than in the formal Mode of Instruction  Remark too they say  La Cadette de ces deux  we say "The youngest of the three" The Sense is the same though the Expression is somewhat different for  Cadette  signifies properly one that is younger  Le Cadet  for Example is  the younger Brother  whereas  Cadette  in this Place implies  the Sister who was younger than the other two  When they talk of any Thing that we learn they use  scavoir  instead of  pouvoir  as you may see in the Original and it is worth your Observarion  I cannot say but the Translation has the  true Spirit  of French in it for this reason it vexes me to see you fail in the commonest Things I shall not trouble you with a new Exercise till Saturday that you may consider what I have remarked in this and my fomer Letters with Care and Diligence  Je suis votre Ami J P  LETTER XII  London  Aug    Dear Nancy  I Have the Pleasure of yours of the th I have not yet seen your Mama when I do I shall deliver her your Letter  I shall not dispute your Care but there is a wide Difference between taking Care and taking due Care We may exercise a great deal but if it is not rightly conducted it may be very unprofitable If you would survey your Verbs with Attention you would not  write  liser  for  lire  nor  ils etoit  for  ils etoient  These Errors would never happen if you were as circumspect as you ought to be I do not expect that you should fall upon the best Phrases in the French Language that is impossible but when you compare the Originals with your Translations you should do it with so much Accuracy as to imprint the French Phrases and Idioms strongly on your Mind Remember what I wrote to you about the Exercise  The Character of  Finette  on the other Side when you lay that and the Original together you will have a good Opportunity to remark the different Use of the perfect and imperfect Tense  I have got  Gil Blas  to divert you when you return to Town if you are very anxious to see it and are to stay some further Time in the Country I will send it by the Coach  I was far from well when I wrote last and rather worse on Sunday but have been prevailed upon to take a Medicine and am now much better  They talk warmly of putting more Ships in Commission and raising additional Forces as if there were to be an Invasion and the Pope the Devil and the Pretender French Tyranny and arbitrary Government were all ready to burst in upon us  And at one Sup  To eat us up  as the Dragon of  Wantley  devoured the three poor Children The antiministerial People however say that all this Noise is only like crying  boh  to make a Child quiet and that  the poor Children three  are  England Scotland  and  Ireland  whom they want to make lie quiet till they tye them down in their Cradle and rock them fast asleep Don't you remember when I used to frighten you with the  Fox  Nancy This is just such another Farce if you will believe our  Patriots  as they call themselves But we must not trust them too far for they are thought to be dissatisfied if not disaffected and some of them even suspected  to be  Jacobites  and love their Country notwithstandingBut how can that beWell these Things are above our ordinary Capacities and so we'll e'en let them alone  Ne lisez vous quelquefois la Sainte Ecriture

YOU still continue to use the singular Verb for the plural Is not this Negligence in the highest Degree These little Faults apart the Translation is admirable by far the best you ever made and you improve in every one I grant it is your Application to write fine French that makes you neglect common Things but then it looks ugly to see such good French defective in the very first Principles that a Beginner would be ashamed of I do not think  il causoit  for  il faisoit  good French Pray observe the Arangement of the Original and compare it with your Translation You say  il fit  l'Infidelité de cet Homme de retomber  They say  il fit retomber l'Infidelité  c Hence you may remark that they put as few Words as they can between the Infinitive and the Verb that governs it After  faire  they never use the Particle for Example  je le ferai entrer  and not  d'entrer  or  à entrer  On the whole your Translation charms me and the Faults are but like a little Mole or two on a fine Face I shall give you but a very short Task this Day  I can promise you vast Pleasure in the reading of  Gil Blas  It is worth observing how nicely Mr Preston slides in another Author and lays it before his Pupil as if with a View to her Amusement only By this Means Instruction wears the Face of Kindness and while he fixes her Attention on the Pleasure of the Story and the Utility of the Precept he insensibly advances her in the Knowledge of the Language  It is both instructive and pleasant and very pretty  French I thought it might divert you now and then in bad Weather  I commend you much for accustoming yourself to read the Psalms and Chapters for the Day As the Psalms are a Piece of the finest Poetry in the World as well as of the most divine and exalted Devotion and as you have a Taste for Poetry  How admirably does this excellent Man lead her to a Love of Religion and while he flatters her Vanity in allowing her to have a Taste for the great Beauties of the divine Poetry he at once excites an Attention which is most likely to awaken or even form that Taste and obliges her to employ so much more Time that the Principles of Piety may take Root which by a cursory Reading might make but little Impression on so young a Mind  and like every body who has a Taste must have some preferable Passages  in all Authors I should be glad to know which are your favourite Psalms I will acquaint you afterward which were mine when I was about your Age and which remain so still  J P  LETTER XIV  London  Sept    Dear Nancy  I Have the Pleasure of yours of the th instant Your Translation is admirable It outdoes all your former Outdoings  as our  Laureat  says  Colley Cibber  Esq  There are only two Things scored which you'll correct yourself so I shall not speak of them  I give you till this Day Se'nnight to translate the Exercise I now send I have preserved the French Air and Idiom as much as I could to lead you by the Hand as it were to translate it well  Madame votre Mere se porte passablement bien Madame M elle et moi nous dinames ensemble hier chez elle Madame Mvous faite bien de Compliments Le Temps commence d'etre un peu rude ne serez vous pas de Retour  bientot  Tout le Monde de votre Connoisance a grande Envie de vous revoir  You cannot imagine my dear Nancy whar Pleasure your Choice of the Psalms gives me they are every one my own Favourites every one without Exception But then I had some more such as the but especially the The th is also a fine Psalm but I would have you read them in the Bible and not in our PrayerBook The Stile is much nobler in the Bible that Translation being far better than the other  The Book of  Ecclesiastes  is the properest Book I know to be read for making a true Judgment and Estimate of human Life and the Things of the World and the Book of  Proverbs  and the Wisdom  of  Jesus  the Son of  Sirach  in the  Apocrypha  contain the wisest Precepts for the Conduct of private Life  We may observe in this Place and indeed throughout these Letters how strongly Mr Preston inculcates the Maxim that a servent Piety is the necessary and indispensable Qualification of a wise welllettered and a polished Mind    I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  LETTER XV  Dear Nancy  THIS is chiefly to cover the enclosed from your Mama I am afraid you are ill that you have not wrote to me these two Posts but perhaps you have been busy or

There has not been any Loss of the Tutor's Letters to occasion this great Chasm in the Dates He was in Town with his Pupil and the Instruction was carried on in Person During this Interval he grounded her in English and French and made her acquainted with such easy Writings as he judged necessary to train her Mind to a Knowledge of higher Authors How far she profited may be seen from those which he proposes for the Subjects of their Letters in this Renewal of their Correspondence    Dear Nancy  NOthing has happened since I saw you worth writing We set out yesterday Morning at a Quarter after four and arrived here this Evening at a Quarter before eight heartily weary of the StageCoach as most People are  I was at Church this Forenoon and heard a Sermon preached before the Heads of the University  I hope you will continue to translate and be strict to the same but you must take some Liberty in the Expression because the Idioms of the two Languages will not admit of a literal Translation you must therefore follow Horace's Advice  Not Word for Word too faithfully translate  In my next I shall begin to make Observations upon Virgil Homer Milton or any other Author you shall think fit to mention to me for we may vary our Subject occasionally and derive Advantage from it Whatsoever Book you  are engaged in if there be any Point on which you may wish to have my Opinion I hope you will apply without Reserve and be assured I shall always gratify myself when I can oblige you  I give my humble Service to your Mother and Aunt and am  my dear Nancy  your sincere Friend and Servant J P  LETTER XVII  Oxon  Sept    Dear Nancy  I Received your Letter yesternight and am charmed with it It is written with Sense and Spirit and in an easy familiar  Stile as all Letters should be written The Writing too is good the Lines strait and the Paper kept free from Blurs or Blots These Particulars give me Pleasure Pray persevere in this Care and Attention Good Habits are full as easy to be attained and preserved as bad ones The only Point is to s  t out in a right Way at first and enter upon it with Determination  I would have you by all Means purchase the  Archbishop of Cambray's Dialogues des Morts  with the Fables and Lives of the antient Philosophers they are all bound up together in one Volume It is an excellent Book and though one would think that you a young Girl should have little to do with the Lives  of old Philosophers yet you cannot fail of finding many Things which will be of vast Advantage to you if you duly observe them You will perceive that even the greatest Men were subject to gross Failings and Follies but the main Points to claim your Observation are those wise Rules and Maxims that were established among them some by one some by another and the salutary Observations they made of Men and Things These if you consider them will be of great Service to you in the Conduct of Life  I would have you my Dear to read often the Proverbs of  Solomon  the  Ecclesiastes Ecclesiasticus  and the  Wisdom of the Son of Sirach  There are few Books which I know fit to be compared  with them for Instructions to make us wise and happy  I would likewise recommend to you the th th th th th and th Satires of  Juvenal  and the d of  Persius  and that you would think well and often on them  Preserve still that Goodness and Sweetness of Temper of which you are so much Mistress and that Modesty Humility and Freedom from Affectation Pride and Vanity which without Flattery are so remarkable in you Persevere unceasingly in Affection and Obedience to your Mother in Kindness and Compassion to your FellowCreatures and above all in the Fear and Love of God there  will be then no Danger but that you will find People who will love and esteem you nay very probably even pique themselves on serving you and be proud to be thought your Friends and Benefactors  Let me hear from you often my Dear write freely Let me always know what you are about and what happens to you I long to hear that you are gone into the Country lest you should not be in Time to see Mrs Fbefore she leaves it She is a most deserving Woman and I could wish to make you acquainted with her An Intimacy with a Person of real Merit is one great Blessing of Life they who live longest perceive this most Inform me when you set out  and I will send you a Letter of Introduction  There is a little Book called the  Duke of Rochefoucault  's Maxims full of excellent Observations on the World and human Life I would have you procure this little Treatise either in French or English as you can best meet with it  Adieu ma chere for this Time My kind Service to your Mother and Aunt  I am your faithful Friend J PRESTON  LETTER XVIII  Oxford  Sept    My dear Nancy  AS soon as this comes to your Hand pray carry the enclosed Letter The Gentleman to whom it is addressed and his Wife passed through this Place the Day before yesterday She will be glad to see you she talked very kindly of you and said she had heard a great Character of you  She is a Person of much Worth and good Sense If you converse with her freely and naturally like yourself without Ostentation or Affection you cannot miss to please her  I have heard some of your Acquaintance complain that you are too bashfulregard not thatyour Modesty becomes you Be not too pressing to gain Applause If you go on in your own Way it will come to you uncourted and Love and Esteem will come along with it Endeavour to merit it and the more indifferent you seem about it the more certain you are to acquire it  I have a long Letter for you soon so I shall say no more now but adieu ma très chere  Je suis tout à vous J P  P S  My humble Service to your Mother and Aunt Adieu encore my little dear  LETTER XIX  Oxford  Sept    My dear  I Have your agreeable Letter of the th instant and would have answered it before but that I have been  gaged lately in a little Business which has prevented my writing to you so often as I intended  You want to have long Letters from me I want the same Thing from you I wish you had been particular about your Visit to Mr and Mrs F and that you had let me know the Subject your Conversation turned upon You don't tell me if Mr Whas sent the  Archbishop  of Cambray  's Book nor what you think of  Rochefoucault  's Maxims but as you are deeply engaged in  Homer  I can easily excuse that  There are infinite Beauties in  Homer  and though all Translations must in some Respects fall short of so great an Original yet I think Mr  Pope  preserves the Life and Soul and Fire of it in a great Degree There is not such a vast Warmth and Ardour in  Virgil  but then there is such a Beauty and I may say Loveliness in him as passes all Description nor is it possible for the Heart of a Reader who is ignorant of this Original to form any Manner of Idea of it When you read  Pope  's Translation you read something like  Homer  himself but  when you read  Dryden  's Translation of  Virgil  you can scarce have any Notion or Image of his genuine Excellencies No Painter ever gave more fine and lively Expression to a Picture or with more Exactness and Judgment than  Virgil  gives to his Descriptions Nay if you saw the Thing itself represented before you it would scarcely make a deeper Impression Yet I do not hereby presume to aver that  Dryden  was a Poet inferior to  Pope  but he was old and not à  son Aise  when he translated  Virgil  A betExcuse however may be brought for him namely that neither our Language nor to my Belief any other Language in the World can come up to the Beauty Elegance and Energy of the matchless Original  Though no one can read  Homer  who has any though ever so little Elevation of Fancy without being charmed with him yet if we are let into his great Design the Structure and Contrivance of his Fable the Plot Conduct and Execution of the Whole with what the Criticks call the Characters the Sentiments Diction Figures Descriptions c I say when these Things are duly known we shall have a much greater Pleasure in reading him than otherwise we can possibly attain  If you will read  Pope  's Introduction to the  Iliad  with Care it will prove of great Use to you You should also make yourself acquainted with his Notes but in order to have a just Conception of this  Stile of Writing it is necessary to pay great Attention to  Bossu  's Treatise of Epick Poetry It is commended as the most judicious Essay on that Subject that ever was written and though it be of little Use to us till we are somewhat acquainted with Epick Poetry yet once dipped into that excellent Way of Writing it is of infinite Service to give us a true Taste for it We should experience the Advantage of it in a high Degree through the  Iliad  the  Odyssey  the  Aeneid  and  Paradise Lost  Many other Epick Poems are written which perhaps may as well be let alone as read I except some prose Performances such as  Telemaque Tasso  's  Jerusalem delivered  has been recommended to me  well worth reading it was originally written in Italian  I am apt to think Mr  Preston  was not singular in having lived many Years ignorant of this beautiful Production Within the small Circle of my Acquaintance I have been amazed on quoting  Tasso's Jerusalem  to find several Persons of exquisite Taste and Lovers of reading utter Strangers to the very Name It is surely an admirable Poem and should be universally known  There is however I am told an old Translation of it into English by  Edward Fairfax  which I am going to read forthwith A Friend on whose Taste and Judgment I can depend assures me it is an admirable Work abounding with exquisite Poetry and all the Spirit of an Original  Statius  who certainly had a great poetic Genius wrote an Heroic Poem in Latin called the  Thebaid  but it falls so infinitely short of  Virgil  in some Particulars and  perhaps in  all  except in his Fire of which  Statius  had a large Portion that his Poem and  Virgil  's are often opposed to each other in  Bossu  by way of contrast so that you may there see close and nice Examples of Judiciousness and Injudiciousness Beauties and Defects It might be of great Advantage to you to have  Statius  and  Virgil  before you when you read  Bossu  that you might immediately consult the Originals when any remarkable Quotation is made There is some Part of the  Thebaid  translated by Mr  Pope  but I do not know if the whole is rendered into English by any Hand Now if you are inclined to read  Bossu  I will send it to you  There are some noble Beauties in  Homer  and  Virgil  which I have with great Accuracy observed Perhaps the chief of them may have been noticed by other People however as they are  my own  and not borrowed from though they may resemble others I flatter myself they may not be unwelcome to you  To begin with  Homer  We are to consider in the first Place what was his Design or End in writing an Heroick Poem abstracted entirely from the Tendency of the Work  The End this Poet proposed to himself perhaps was to procure Praise perhaps Profit The latter has been too often the Case of Poets and if the Tradition be  true that  Homer  was blind and poor it might have been the same with him  Horace  ingenuously confesses of himself  Paupertas impulit audax  Ut Versus facerem  to wit  Poverty which is impudent compelled me  to write Verses  Yet when we consider the Sublimity and almost Divinity of  Homer  's Writings we are surely tempted to think that he was not poor if he was how much is he to be admired and revered who scorned to stoop to low disgraceful Subjects by which however he might possibly have obtained an easier and more plentiful Subsistence than by producing such a laborious sublime and useful Work  It is probable that the  Aeneid  was wrote with a Design to compliment  Augustus  Caesar  and procure his Favour Allowing this I cannot but think that  Virgil  pleased himself at the same Time with the Beauty and Loveliness of the Characters and Descriptions he gave us and in the Reflection of having endeavoured to make Mankind better by representing the Excellence of Virtue and Detestability  I believe this is a Word of Mr  Preston  's own Coining but the Strength and Application of it appeared to me to carry the Apology with them It cannot be objectionable I presume to any but a Caviller A liberal Judge scorns on every flight Occasion ta make a cold Appeal to a Dictionary Not but in my humble Opinion the Word though not to be found is very justifiable in grammatical Propriety We have  Placability  us well as  placable  and why not  Detestability  as well as  detestable  And are not such Liberties so long as they do not contradict Reason and Probability not only allowable but Praiseworthy inasmuch as they contribute to enlarge and enrich our Language  of Vice in their distinct Colours  You perceive hereby that we are to distinguish between the End an Author  proposes to himself by his Work and that which he proposes to the World The general Design and Tendency may be equally to amuse and improve Mankind the particular Tendency to inculcate some useful Truth in the Minds of those Persons for whom the Work was chiefly written  Virgil  founds his Subject on the Actions and Sufferings of  Aeneas  from the Destruction of  Troy  till he settled a new Empire in  Italy  and the Lesson to be deduced from it seems to be the great Efficacy of a due Mixture of active and  passive Virtues His  Aeneas  is wise just pious valiant goodnatured patient and firm to his Purpose These Virtues carry him at last through all his Difficulties but his Patience and Piety seem most important to him This is nicely judicious in the Author to make the Hero owe his Happiness to his unrepining Endurance of Hardships his implicit Submission to the Will of Heaven and his pious Affection for his Father his Son his Friends and his People hence he is beloved of them all and we find notwithstanding his long Sufferings he was the peculiar Care of Heaven  Man is not a faultless Being  Virgil  therefore did not chuse to draw his Hero out of Nature He has described him with the Imperfections of a human Being  He is very culpable in his Behaviour to  Dido  This is his great Fault but you see the Author has judiciously attributed that to him which the greatest of Men are liable to and the best of Men sometimes fall into  Aeneas  however acted not half so bad a Part by  Dido  as  David  did with respect to  Bathsheba  and  Uriah  and yet you see it cost  Aeneas  very dear and it was not without great Grief and Anguish of Heart that he extricated himself at last Supposing the Story to be true a Man of so much Goodness of Disposition as  Aeneas  must have had many bitter Reflections during the whole Course of his Life for his Behaviour at  Carthage  and the fatal Event which attended it  Dido  stands a great Example to all Ages of the Danger and Ruin a Woman  of Virtue exposes herself to who ventures to give way though ever so slightly to the first Advances towards illicit Love To your Sex she should be a perpetual Warning It is worth your while to set the Picture before you We will forget the  Queen  and consider her as more Woman We find her struggle with her Inclination at first and even swear against giving way to her Passion yet she listened with Pleasure to every thing  Aeneas  said By Degrees she is overcome She then throws off all Reserve and Shame neglects her Affairs gadds about with him from Place to Place throwing aside all the Decorum of her Sex and Situation rides and hunts with him At length poor Woman she finds he is going to forsake her  She storms and threatens weeps and intreats by Fits now sends a resentful now a submissive Message He answers all with Respect and Goodmanners but at he same Time with Coldness and Indifference This Treatment fills her with Agony unspeakable Rest and Sleep are utter Strangers to her At length he departs from  Carthage  then she becomes distracted exposes herself to the whole City execrates herself for not having destroyed him his Son and herself she then sinks again into Complaints and Lamentations till she is lost in Despair and resolves to sacrifice her Life Possessed with this horrid Determination she becomes outrageous and flies through her Apartments with the Looks and Fury  of a Fiend devoting him and his Posterity to endless Torments The Presents he had made her then meet her Eyes she dissolves into Tears at the Sight and moans in painful Recollection over the happy Hours she had passed with him Unable longer to endure the Variety of Torments that surround her she slays herself with a Sword which had belonged to the Author of them and in the Agonies of Death throws herself on the rich Apparel he had left behind him Be it not forgot that in this Act of Despair she placed the Picture  It is remarkable that in some capital Paintings of the Death of  Dido  this very natural and striking Circumstance of the Picture is omitted by the Artists  of her Lover on the funeral Pile Thus  notwithstanding all her Rage and Re  entment Love held the largest Dominion over her Mind and possessed her  o the last  Collect the whole and meditate well  pon it It nearly behoves you and  very one of your Sex so to do for be  ssured my dear Nancy every loose  etrayer is pictured in  Aeneas  and every  educed Woman in  Dido  From the Days of  Virgil  to this present Hour the  etrayer will abandon the Victim of his  nwarrantable Passion and the Victim will sink under Misery and Despair and  uch must be the End of every licentious Amour yet your unhappy Sex will not  ake Warning though all Ages and Histo  ians unite to prove the fatal Truth  I have given you a very long Letter the Story of  Dido  led me so far beyond what I proposed but as it was done with a view to your future Safety and Welldoing I hope you will not think I have said too much but will treasure up in your Remembrance this cautionary Admonition of  your very sincere Friend J P  LETTER XX  Oxon  Sept    Dear Nancy  THE Beauties and various Incidents in the Fourth Book of the  Aeneid  engaged me so closely as to make me  postpone what I should before have observed namely the Tendency of this most noble Poem I now come to it  Near the Beginning of the first Book  Virgil  makes this Reflection "So great a Task was it to found the Roman Empire  Tantae Molis erat Romanam condere Gentem  So it runs in the Original and in  Dryden    Such Time such Toil requir'd the Roman Name  Such Length of Labour for so vast a Frame  " From which I am of Opinion that the immediate and particular Design of his Work was to imprint on the Minds of the  Romans  his Countrymen a great Esteem for themselves a passionate Love for their Country and a becoming  Piety and Gratitude towards the Gods those Gods who had fought for them who had led them through so many Dangers and Difficulties and after such severe Encounters with other Nations and even with some of the Deities themselves who were Enemies to the  Trojans  had at last settled them in that fine Country of  Italy  and from small Beginnings had enabled them to grow up to such a Height as perhaps the World had never seen before nor ever shall again  If this was  Virgil  's Design and surely it is very probable how agreeable is it to what we find in holy Writ  Jacob  says  I have passed over this Brook with my Staff and now I am become two Bands  Moses  tells the Israelites that they were the fewest of all People and God had made them a mighty and a strong Nation This is in order to excite in them Gratitude and Piety  David  in a hundred Places mentions the Assistance of God whereby from a low and de  picable Estate he was become great and mighty  I am poor and needy but the Lord careth for me  He teacheth my Hands to fight  A Bow of Brass is broken by my Arms  By my God I shall leap over a Wall  He subdueth the People under me  As the Lord liveth who hath redeemed my Soul out of all Adversity  c  Now  Virgil  when he wrote his  Aeneid  seems to have been possessed of the same Sentiments as those of  David Moses  and  Jacob  It appears manifestly so by the Spirit which runs through his whole Work  We find him every where in love with Piety Prudence Patience Constancy of Mind Modesty Humanity Candour and in short with all that is praiseworthy He has beside a Passion for the BellesLettres  and Arts and Sciences in general and by his Maxims recommends a sober industrious Life and Contentment with a little rather than we should prostitute ourselves and our Principles for Gain so that this noble Work is not only a fine Poem but moreover a compleat System of Morality  Not only the Virtues abovementioned are recommended and placed in a favourable Light throughout the whole Work but their contrary Vices are branded with Infamy and Detestation always hurtful if not fatal to the Persons possessed of them The Author makes Virtue and Piety carry People through all Difficulties that is in most Instances but he has peculiar Exceptions He knew too much of the World and of Nature  to make it always so This would have been contradictory to Experience and even his own Maxims for he frequently gives us plain Intimations that it often pleases Providence to do and bring about Things which we cannot account for You may remember for Instance that at the Burning of  Troy Aeneas  lost his wife  Creusa  in the Confusion He returned and went again through all his Dangers in quest of her At last she  appears  to him and desires him to employ no more Sollicitude about her for he was never to see her again She adds that such Things do not happen but by the Will and Ordination of Heaven intimating that it was the great Mother of the Gods who had detained her in those Parts purposely that she might not  be enslaved by the Greeks Lastly she recommends with great Earnestness their Son  Ascanius  to his Care the common Pledge of their Love Now to ask why a virtuous affectionate Couple should be so dreadfully separated and why  Creusa  should perish in  Troy  who had not deserved it by any Crime were to ask a presumptuous and an impious Question allowing the Story to be true It was undoubtedly to answer some great and better Purpose intentionally concealed from our weak Judgments and this is the Lesson which  Virgil  means to give us  Creusa  's tender Concern for her Child is most affectingly natural and the Reality has been verified in the Deathbed Farewel of many worthy Wives  Will you permit me to digress one Moment to mark to you a Beauty of this Kind in our great dramatic Bard our  Shakespeare  In the third Act of  Hamlet  when the  Ghost  appears to the Prince and his Mother in the Closet "to whet his almostblunted Purpose" he suddenly breaks from that to a tender Concern and Compassion for the Queen's Situation  But see Amazement on thy Mother sits  O step between her and her fighting Soul  Conceit in weakest Bodies strongest works  Speak to her Hamlet  This Solicitude for the Sufferings of one who in Life was dear surviving the Grave is most inexpressibly beautiful  To return to  Virgil  don't you think Nancy that if he had lived since Popery came into the World the Roman Catholics would have said that the Mother of the Gods detaining  Creusa  meant that the  Virgin Mary  had taken her into her especial Service  Whenever this Author makes virtuous Persons suffer it is necessary that you should observe he makes them guilty of some Fault which naturally brings on their Distresses and it is to such Fault yon must attribute them abstractedly from their good Qualities I shall give you a short Instance or two  The hopeful the beautiful the virtuous  Pallas  was killed untimely in  the very Bloom of his Youth so was the charming young  Euryalus  the only Joy of his Mother as the other was the only Hope of his Father  Lausus  met also the same Destiny the worthy Son of an unworthy Father  Now while you pity them consider they were all three too rash The Heat of Youth carried them beyond the Bounds of Prudence they all loved their Parents and were beloved by them with great Tenderness but that Heat and Impetuosity rendered them disobedient  Pallas  's Eagerness made him  break his Promise  to his Father The Case was much the same with  Lausus  after he had saved his Father's Life his Eagerness prevented his attending him though often and often sent for  Euryalus  undertook  an Exploit above his Years and that without taking Leave of an affectionate Mother Much is to be learned from these Examples for though  Virgil  does not expressly say they suffered on these Accounts yet he plainly insinuates it Again the impious Father of  Lausus  is forced to confess that his Wickedness was the original Cause of his Son's Loss and owns it to be a just Judgment on him  By these Examples  Virgil  teaches us how dangerous it is to fail in a Point of Duty to Parents albeit through the mere Frailty of our Nature and neither out of Contempt nor Stubbornness of Temper  Adieu my dear  J P  LETTER XXI  Oxon  Sept    My dear  THE infinite Beauties of  Virgil  have carried me so much farther than I intended that if I can prevail upon myself I shall contract what I have to say further on this Subject into a narrow Compass though there are so many Charms in this glorious Poem that I scarce know how to quit it  To point out all the Excellencies of the  Aeneid  it would be necessary to repeat the whole Poem I will therefore only touch on some of those Passages  which please me most and are what I judge the chief Beauties  In the first Book we may remark his meeting with his Mother under the Figure of a Huntress his going to  Carthage  the Reception which the Queen gave him and her becoming enamoured of him and the Artifice which  Venus  used for that Purpose  The Story of  Sinon  in the second Book the Return of  Aeneas  to seek his Wife his Interview and Conversation with her Spirit and the affectionate Care and Anxiety he testified for his Father his Son and whole Family are very affecting  How striking are his Adventures and Distresses through the whole third Book  but particularly his Encounter with  Helenus  and  Andromache  How natural was all that happened on that Event The Story of  Achaemenides  the  Cyclopes  and the Description of  Aetna  In the fourth Book the whole Process of the Loves of  Aeneas  and  Dido  with their fatal Consequences are beyond all Parallel all Power of Imitation  In the fifth the funeral Games are introduced in Honour of  Anchises  particularly the Mockfight of the Children called Ludus Trojanus These are followed by the burning of the Ships and Behaviour of the Matrons  The whole sixth Book is inexpressibly fine his meeting with  Dido  and their mutual Behaviour thereon his encountering  Deiphobus  and his Father and having the Ghosts of his Posterity shewn him are all most awefully affecting  Shakespeare  seems to have imitated this last Circumstance in his  Macbeth  How well does he describe the Joys of Heaven and Hell and what Sort of Inhabitants are to be found in each Place The chief in Heaven are those who have suffered Wounds and Death for their Country Priests who have lived a holy Life becoming their Profession and Bards who have written and sung in pious Strains not unworthy of the  Gods intimating that those who prostitute such sublime Talents to mean and vitious Purposes deserve nor the Care of Heaven Next in Degree to these are Persons who have employed their Life in Arts and Inventions for the Benefit of Mankind and such as have distinguished themselves by doing good  In the other State he allots the greatest Share of Misery to those who when alive hated their Brethren Herein the Writer agrees exactly with what our  Saviour  said to  Peter  about forgiving his Brother and what is likewise inculcated in many other Parts of Scripture St  John  says  He that sayeth he loveth God and hateth his Brother is a Lyar and the Truth is not in him  We next behold those who have rejected their Parents defrauded their Dependants and deceived such as confided in them after which come those who have sate brooding over their Gold and refused to share it with the needy those who have sold their Country for mercenary Ends have wrested the Laws and destroyed the Constitution and those who have dared to be guilty of Adultery or Incest To what noble Purposes my dear Nancy does this visionary Scene conduce How admirably has  Virgil  's Fancy and Morality gone Hand in Hand  Do you not admire that charming Description in the seventh Book of the different Nations who came as Allies to the War which was impending Their Behaviour Habits Arms Customs how infinitely entertaining and particularly the charming Picture of  Camilla  the female Warrior and her Troop of Ladies  The great Events in the ensuing Part of the Work are  Aeneas  's Visit to  Evander  the Conversation and Consequences the simple Way of Life pursued by that old Prince the Story of  Cacus  and that of  Nisus  and  Euryalus  the Praises of  Hercules  the Speeches of  Turnus  and  Drances  and the Deaths of  Pallas Camilla  and  Lausus  What noble Fire and Spirit does he display when he describes the  Conflict between  Aeneas  and  Turnus  and how sublime are the Sentiments of the latter when he discovers that he had been pursuing a Spectre instead of  Aeneas  and again when he is about to expire These my dear Nancy are such great and beautiful Passages as appear to rise in your Estimation the more you consider and the oftner you peruse them  It is worth your while also to observe how humane a Man and how fine a Gentleman  Virgil  appears throughout his whole Work With what Pleasure does he dwell on Instances of Piety paternal Love filial Duty conjugal Affection Humanity Hospitality and every social Virtue With what apparent Delight  does he speak of a lovely Child or a promising Youth We see Instances of this in his  Ascanius Astyanax Euryalus Pallas  and  Lausus  He seems to describe with no less Participation of Joy Examples of fond tender Parents in  Aeneas Evander Creusa Andromache Amata  and the Mother of  Euryalus  He instructs us in the Knowledge of human Nature wherein he was deeply skilled by painting the Love and Concern for a worthy Son in the savage and impious Mind of  Mezentius  We may hence derive some very important Truths and Lessons We learn first that Love to our Children is so inherent that Persons who acknowledge no other Claim who feel no other Call of Nature  and who are actually guilty of great Faults in other Respects still preserve their Duty and Affection here We learn beside that Worth and Goodness will always be beloved and admired and extort some Degree of Approbation even from the most unfeeling Heart Had the Son of  Mezentius  been less deserving probably his Father would not have mourned his Loss to such Excess  Aeneas  not so strongly regretted having killed him nor would  Virgil  have bewailed him in such Terms as to use the Expression of  Horace  "were worth his dying for" He lost his Life through his Excess of Virtue he was alarmed with Grief and Fear at Sight of his Father's Danger rushed between him and  Aeneas  and preserved his Parent By  this we are taught another useful Truth namely that no Fault of a Parent can supersede the Duty of a Child He might have escaped after he had preserved his Father but Rashness so incident to Youth drove him to venture beyond his Strength  Aeneas  forewarned him he was deaf to this humane Advice and his Death was the natural Consequence  How finely natural is the Interview between  Aeneas  and  Andromache  the Widow of  Hector  and Mother of  Astyanax  It is worth your while to place them plainly and exactly before you She weeps he stands amazed and can hardly  hiss  out such is the literal Meaning of  Virgil  's Expression a few Words  When she has Power of Utterance she expatiates on many Subjects at once she relates the Story of her Life since the taking of  Troy  then enquires of his then questions him about his Son if he was not a promising Youth if he did not copy after him and his Uncle  Hector  and if he did not take to Heart the Death of his Mother At parting from  Aeneas  she takes Leave of  Ascanius  she calls him the very Picture of her poor  Astyanax  she discovers the same Countenance Eyes and Hands and that had he happily survived he would have been of the same Growth This is the very Strength and Beauty of Nature whose Workings and Effects are the same in all Degrees of Life Our Stations may be different but our Feelings are alike  Virgil  not only dwells upon the Duty of Children to their Parents but even to their Nurses to those who have had the Care of their Infancy He recommends this and exalts the Character of his Hero at the same Time That Part of the Coast of  Italy  where the Nurse of  Aeneas  was buried was called after her Name and the pious Hero bestowed on her an honourable Funeral  How pleasing is the Description of  Anna  's Nurse whom  Dido  treated with the same Tenderness as she would her own who was deceased with an Intent and busy Air labouring to execute the Queen's Orders  Virgil  's Expression is "Studio anili" that is with that Caution  and Concern so peculiar to her Age and Office  Our Author appears also as partially fond of his old Men who are good and pious his  Priam Anchises Evander  and  Butes Priam  is the first Man to encourage  Sinon  and  Anchises  is the same to  Achaemenides  You see the Care and Attention which the Tutor of  Ascanius  shews his Pupil Thus  Virgil  paints Mankind in every Stage and Station of Life and in all with equal Propriety his Judgment never fails him  I had forgot to recommend two very fine Passages the Meeting between  Alecto  and  Turnus  and the Story of  Aeneas  's Shield made by  Vulcan  Had I  nothing to divert me from this my favourite Employ of instructing you my Observations should be more copious and distinct but still I hope they are what will be of some Use If I have not tired you I will employ another Letter on this same Subject so difficult do I find it to leave this admirable Writer ever desiring you to retain in your Mind that it is not in Order to make you a Critic only to enable you to read these two incomparable Poems the  Iliad  and  Aeneid  with Pleasure and Profit  I am  my dear Angel  tout à vous J P  P S  I send this by a private Hand  LETTER XXII  Oxon  Sept    My dear Angel  I Received yours of the d instant it gave me more Pleasure than I can express Your Sentiments of particular Passages in  Homer  so far as you have read are just and fine and I desire you will give me your Thoughts on all the Remainder as you proceed  Homer  certainly strikes us more than  Virgil  at first He surpasses almost all Writers in Loftiness in Strength in Fire and in a boundless Fancy But more of this at Length when we come to have him before us and make him our  mutual Topic though in Truth you have prevented a good deal of what I should have had to say on him and will continue so to do as you go on I will now conclude my Observations on the  Aeneid  and that in as few Words as possible  Virgil  makes his Hero not only do humane Offices to his Friends his Relations and to his Nurse but even to his Servants His Care of the Funerals of  Misenus  his Trumpeter and  Palinurus  his Pilot are Instances of this  When he describes a funeral Pomp a Sacrifice the Admission of an Ambassador the Consecration of a Trophy the Celebration of a Festival the Solemnities  at declaring War or concluding Peace or any Ceremonial whatsoever it is not only most beautifully delivered but we may be assured he lets us at the same time into the exact Manners and Customs of the  Romans  on all such Occasions so that Delight and Instruction go Hand in Hand  Not only every word in  Virgil  is a Jewel but they are all so put together that every Sentence may be said to represent a String of Jewels set to the best Advantage and the whole  Aeneid  is so compact one Part so connected with another that they tend to illustrate each other in the most striking Colours and follow in such natural Order and Process as renders  the whole Work beautiful and places it in the most becoming Point of Sight  It is observable that  Virgil  never uses an idle Word Although there are some things the Purpose whereof we do not perceive at a first reading yet on nearer observation before or by the Time we reach the End of the Poem we plainly discover it I'll give you an Instance of this fine Address in  Virgil  He makes his Hero not only the greatest Character in his Work but also the most beautiful and virtuous This is the Reverse of  Homer  's Proceeding who seems to make  Hector  's Character the most lovely of his Heroes and perhaps both Poets were in the Right as I shall hereafter  endeavour to make appear when we come to compare Notes on the Greek  Virgil  describes  Turnus  fierce and haughty when he kills  Pallas  he does it with Pleasure he insults over him and dispatches a cruel Message to his Father He indeed sends back the Body for this Author seems resolved not to make  Turnus  so savage as  Achilles  but spoils him of his Armour and puts it on himself together with the gorgeous Belt which  Pallas  wore Now we should be apt to suppose at this particular Crisis that there was nothing more implied herein than that it was customary for great Warriors to wear the Arms of Adversaries whom they had subdued But we find afterwards  that  Virgil  had a particular Use to make of this Belt which he had so especially mentioned  Turnus  puts it on and wears it in Triumph whereon the Poet makes a useful Reflection and at the same time gives us a Hint of what will follow "The Mind of Man" says he  elated with Prosperity is incapable of behaving with Moderation and blind to Futurity The Time will come when  Turnus  will sorely regret that ever he assaulted  Pallas  I will break off here lest my Letter should be too long and give you one more on this Subject  The Lines you have quoted  "As when the Moon refulgent Lamp of Night" c l to l  are in my Opinion the most beautiful in the  whole  Iliad  If you remember one Night as we were coming through the Park after I had repeated to you  Milton  's Description of a fine Evening I endeavoured to give you those but could not recollect them all  Adieu my Dear J P  LETTER XXIII  Oxford  Oct    My Dear  YOUR Letter of the th came safe to my Hand on the th I really cannot tell you particularly when I shall be in Town but believe it will be some Time this Month My comings depends on the Receipt of some Letters from  Scotland  As you intend to read the  Aeneid  again there are many things that I shall pass over because I would not forestall the Pleasure you are to have if you read it with due Attention I shall only finish the Remark I began about  Pallas  's Belt  When  Aeneas  vanquishes  Turnus  at the latter Part of the Poem  Turnus  sues for his Life Now it was not proper to grant it and the Nicety was how to make  Aeneas  who was so famous for Humanity and a merciful Disposition not comply with the Request and yet preserve his own Character Behold this very Belt is made use of which naturally and critically meets his Eye at the very Instant when his Anger begins to relent and his Heart to melt He immediately fires with fresh Resentment on  recollection of the cruel Insults which  Turnus  was guilty of when he flew  Pallas  Hence a noble Indignation Resentment and even Compassion for the Fate of  Pallas  occasions the Death of  Turnus  and thus the Poet by a beautiful Stroke of Fancy makes that great Event the Result of Friendship and Pity which otherwise had been an Act of Cruelty We learn also from the Instance before us this fine Lesson "That what People are most proud and vain of is often the Occasion of their Ruin" There is a noble Reflection to this Purpose at the End of the tenth Satire of Juvenal All that I have further to say about the  Aeneid  is to point out to you some charming Comparisons and then I have done with it This I shall do in my next  Letter which I propose writing on Sunday  I would have you my dear look into the Lives of the ancient Philosophers and particularly regard their Observations made on Life they will be of great Use to you  You do not tell me what you think of the Duke of  Rochefoucault's  Maxims and Observations  I am now going through Ovid's Metamorphoses anew and the more I read the more I am charmed with it I wonder you do not proceed in that Work No Man surely had ever so easy so natural so charming a Manner of telling a Story You love Novels  Ovid  has an  Hundred at least and all of them infinitely beautiful in their Way But no more of him at present It will be near a Week before I can say any thing to you about  Homer  Adios  It is necessary to observe here that Mr Preston had an Intention had he lived to make his Pupil acquainted with Italian Spanish and Latin after she was wellgrounded in English and French It is with this view therefore that he occasionally slides in particular Words to awaken her Curiosity in order to make that Instruction wear the Air of a Gratification of her Inquiries rather then the Imposition of a Task which if formally laid down might appear too heavy and laborious  Yours most sincerely J P  LETTER XXIV  Oxford  Oct    My Dear Nancy  I Wrote to you on the st instant with a small Enclosure which I hope is come safe to Hand It will enable you  to buy the  Iliad  since you love it so well and furnish you with a little Pocket money over and above  You neither write me if you have been to see the Lady I recommended again nor how you like  Rochefoucault  nor the Archbishop of  Cambray's  Lives of the Philosophers but I fancy  Homer  engages all your Attention at present  I shall conclude all that I have to say about  Virgil  with pointing out some few striking Comparisons  In the first Book of the  Aeneid Neptune  reproving the Winds and the Waves is well compared to a Man of Merit and Authority speaking to an enraged Mob In the Fourth  Dido  to a wounded Deerand  Turnus  and  Aeneas  to two distinct Conflagrations in different Parts of a Forest or two Torrents pouring down a steep Hill When  Aeneas  after the Arrow was drawn out with which he was wounded is returning to the Place of Battle with the whole Corps de Reserve while Clouds of Dust arise and the Earth trembles with the Beating of the Horses Feet his Enemies struck with Terror are nobly compared to Husbandmen who see a black Storm coming across the Sea that threatens universal Ruin destroys the Trees and lays waste the Fruits of the Earth  The Poet makes it still more terrible by one peculiar Circumstance which is a  whisking  Wind a certain Forerunner of such a dreadful Storm as he there describes  Aeneas  pursuing  Turnus  and not being able to overtake him is aptly likened to a Hound pursuing a Deer and this is so lively a Representation to one who has seen such a Chace as nothing can surpass ☞ Again  Turnus  in his Engagement with  Aeneas  when confounded with Fear and the bad Omens he had met with and persuaded the Gods were against him fights indeed but in such a Manner as one imagines one does in a Dream How forcibly picturesque But read it That exceeds all Description  There is however a Comparison in  Milton  which is far beyond all I ever read in  Virgil Homer  or any where That is the Comparison of  Michael  and  Satan  to two black Clouds that fill up the different Parts of the Sky big with Thunder Lightening and Tempest and at last discharge their whole Artillery at each other  The last Observation I shall make on  Virgil  is that he has been a great Lover of what is called the Belles Lettres We can perceive that be admired Painting himself by what he relates of  Aeneas  admiring the Paintings in  Dido  's Palace before he broke through the Cloud and by his charming Description of  Aeneas  's Shield You will find too he loved Statuary  Musick and Architecture and you may discern the same of  Ovid  in a hundred Places We see two Instances of his Skill in the Contest between  Pallas  and  Arachne  and beside how nicely he understood the Art of weaving Arras I am reading him over just now He has so many beautiful Stories that I wonder you do not take more Delight in him than you appear to do You love Novels and I never read any so beautiful as his  Pyramus  and  Thisbe Medea  and  Jason Scylla  and  Minos Cephalus  and  Procris Ceyx  and  Alcyone Perseus  and  Andromeda  the Fable of  Niobe Pallas  and  Arachne  the  Muses  and the  Pierides Meleager  and  Atalanta  and a Hundred more are Stories the most exquisitely told that are any where to be found and are withal perfect  Images of Nature You may likewise discern through all how the Poet is delighted with whatever is good and virtuous worthy and laudable and on the other Hand how he detests all kind Vice of and Wickedness nay even every Degree of Rudeness and Illmanners  It is clear to me that  Ovid  was not only one of the greatest Wits and one of the best of Men but one of the bestnatured besthumoured and bestbred Gentlemen in the World He wrote indeed with a Sort of Carelessness and his unhappy Banishment hindered him to correct his admirable Poem the  Metamorphoses  which has ever since continued the great Fund whence Sculptors Painters and Writers of Operas and some  other Dramatic Authors have derived their Subjects  Adieu my Dear  ☞ This is a Sight which it is true I saw once and therefore took care never to see it a second Time  LETTER XXV  Oxford  Oct    My dear Nancy  I Received your most agreeable Letter of the st instant with infinite Pleasure Your Remarks on  Homer  are most agreeable and just I must only observe that  Idomeneus  assisting a wounded Soldier of his own Party and insulting an Enemy are not at all irreconcileable As to what you call a Slip of the Poet's Memory I shall look into the Passage and give you my Opinion in my next  I heartily agree with you in your Censure of  Homer  's making his Heroes so savage and this brings into my Mind a Passage of  Horace  Aliquando bonus dormitat  Homerus  that is  The excellent  Homer  sometimes nods or is like to drop asleep  In Allusion to this the great Earl of  Roscommon  It is much to be lamented that this excellent Writer is not so well known as he deserves to be His Works should be as familiar as dear to all Men of true Taste and Principles He shines with double Lustre forasmuch as he was brave enough to draw his Pen in the Cause of modest Virtue in the licentious Age of  Charles  the Second  in one of his Poems speaking of  Homer  says  His bullying Heroes and his scolding Gods  Make us suspect he sleeps as well as nods  I have much more to say but not Time for it at present I leave off unwillingly  Je suis  Ma très chere  le votre J P  Je scaurois bien dire ce que dit u  Poete excellent      This little playful Condescension to the youthful Disposition of the Pupil in a Man of Learning and Genius is surely a strong Proof of the Sweetness of Mr Preston's Temper and the Mildness of his Heart He still is the Instructor though in a more familiar and engaging Stile We may here discover in a great Measure how extensive an Education he proposed to give her had he lived since it is evident he had at this Time made her Mistress of the Greek Alphabet  A Trial of Skill for youUnriddle it  Hold the Question in your last remains unanswered  Though  Juno  put on the Cestus of  Venus  she still continued  Juno  and  Jupiter  did not take her for  Venus  for she was his Daughter But  Homer  's Poems  re full of the Mythology of the Antients  hat is allegorical Stories By the Ce  us of  Venus  are implied those Charms  nd fine Accomplishments which make Woman lovely  Juno  in fine laid down  l her jealous Fits her Pride her Illna  re and Scolding and put on Sweetness  nd Kindness in their stead If I remem  er right the Poet also says that she dres  d after bathing and washing all Impure  ess from her Person insinuating hereby  how becoming is Elegance and Cleanliness in either Man or Woman  Encore adieu ma chere Je vous souffle dix Baisers  LETTER XXVI  Oxford  Oct    My Dear  I HAVE just now received a Letter from you not dated I wonder the Books should have cost you so much especially  Homer  But I presume you do not know where they may be cheapest purchased or the Bookseller has imposed on youNo matter You have the Authors for your constant Amusement  You have given me a very particular Account how you have laid out the Contents of the Draught but that was more than I desired I only wished to know how it had been  chiefly  bestowed not how you had laid out every Farthing That had been the Exaction of a hard Dealer not the liberal Claim of a Guardian and Friend The more prudently you lay out your Money the better for yourself and this was all the Satisfaction I required I think however you have assigned all that is disbursed to good Uses  I shall write again soon  Adios  J P  LETTER XXVII  Oxford  Oct    My dear Nancy  THE last I wrote to you was short and this will not be much longer it being the fifth Letter this Day and I am accountable for the Dispatch of as many more this Post Pray deliver the enclosed without loss of Time  I hope to be in Town this Week or the next at farthest but let not that hinder your writing to me as oft as you have Leisure If you have Nothing to write write me that Nothing for Nothing you can write will be unwelcome and Nothing will even be welcome if it  look  like Something  In this Play upon a Word Mr Preston seems to have had the following Line of  Ovid  's Art of Love in his Mind or at least is justified by it "If there be  Nothing  brush that  Nothing  thence"  It will shew at least a kind Attention and that is very valuable  In my next I shall treat about  Homer  and hope to have a Letter from you upon that Author that is to say a Continuation of your Remarks This too I flatter myself I shall receive soon  Give my humble Service to your Mama and Aunt and believe me to be  my dear Nancy  your hearty Wellwisher and real Friend J P  LETTER XXVII  Oxford  Oct    My dear Nancy  I HAVE the Pleasure of yours of the st instant and am exceedingly pleased to find you have executed all my Commissions with so much Address and Prudence  You need not fear being troublesome to the Lady your new Acquaintance if you go at proper Times Observe the Disposition the Family is in and whether Business or any other Cause may not make your Visit unseasonable which you'll easily discover and in that case let your Stay be short Take care too  always to leave a due Distance of Time between your Visits What I wrote you once before I will write again though it becomes almost unnecessary now Never give yourself Airs nor shew Affectation nor endeavour to  shine  as it is called Talk modestly within the Compass of your Understanding and if you don't court Praise Praise will court you  Before I enter upon  Homer  let me observe that you have omitted to mention the Figure  Hector  makes at the End of the Twelfth Book where he breaks through the Grecian Entrenchments  like sudden Night and with Eyes burning like Fire  as the Poet expresses it This is thought one of the most spirited Passages in the whole Work It is incomparable  in the Greek and not much short of the Original in the English  I am sorry to tell you that I cannot see you so soon as I expected It will not suit my Affairs to leave this Place for ten Days yet but be sure to write me often in that Time that is as often as your other Business will allow and let  Homer  be the Subject of your Letters I will write you as frequently as I can and begin upon the same Subject  I have just now entered upon  Pope  's Preface and Essay to see whether some of the Particulars I have remarked are not in his Observations  Homer  will furnish us Matter enough to write about I would rather have you send short Letters  and often than long Letters and seldom  My kind Service to your Mama Aunt and Mrs M I hope to dine with you on my Birthday  Adieu my dear Life  I am your real Friend and Servant J P  LETTER XXIX  Oxford  Oct    My dear Nancy  JUST now I have the Pleasure of yours of the th You mentioned a Passage in the Thirteenth Book of the  Iliad  which was the last on that Subject I  am just now reading the Observations on the First Book I hope to see you on Thursday Night or Friday Morning and when I come we shall compare Notes I do not mean to be guilty of a Pun here though it sounds much like it  I shall go tomorrow to a Gentleman's House about twelve miles from this where I shall stay three Days and thence set out for London  My intended Visit is not the Call of Business but mere Matter of Ceremony which you know I am not over fond of yet I think it a kind of Duty to comply with it The Gentleman was here for a Week during which Time I conversed with him frequently He is sensible and his Character good He pressed me earnestly  to give him my Company some Days at his Retreat An earnest Intreaty is a warm Compliment and as my Peculiarity of Humour namely a dislike to Strangers was my strongest Objection I held it incumbent on me by the Rule of Politeness to submit my own Peculiarity to his There are many Punctilios which we ought to give way to as Brethren of Society if a more important Claim does not interfere  Give my Service to the Persons mentioned in your Letter and write me by next Post After that I hope to see you before you will have occasion to write again  I am  dear Nancy  yours most affectionately J P  LETTER XXX  We here see the Tutor on his return to  Oxford  after a short Excursion to  London  and it is worth while to draw a Parallel between the modern Mode of travelling and that which was practised Thirty Years ago Here were Ten Hours consumed in getting Twentyseven Miles and almost two Days requisite for travelling from  London  to  Oxford  Had our present Expedition on the Road been proposed to our Ancestors as a possible Thing they would probably have derided it as the Dream of a Lunatic  Wickham    Miles from London  Nov    My dear Life  I WENT to Bed Yesternight that is to say this Morning about two I was wakened about Five and in the Coach near half an Hour after Seven We got to Uxbridge before Twelve where we took Breakfast but I had wisely drank  three Dishes of Coffee and eaten a buttered Toast beforehand  We arrived here before Five We dined and now after finishing the enclosed Letter I write you this desiring you not to neglect the Enclosure My Health is not clever but I hope to sleep well tonight and then I shall be right again To Children and Persons advanced in Life Sleep is a Medicine for many Ills and surely the pleasantest of all Medicines Did you ever read  Shakespeare  's Tragedy of  Macbeth  if not get it and send me your Opinion of it I will transcribe his Passage on Sleep which for the luxuriant Variety of sweet and no+ble Images is scarce to be equalled  The innocent Sleep  Sleep that knits up the ravell'd Sleeve of Care  The Death of each day's Life sore Labour's Bath  Balm of hurt Minds great Nature's second Course  Chief Nourisher in Life's Feast  What a Group of beautiful Images are here Nor has the great Bard assembled them merely to indulge his fine Fancy no they are of a Piece with the great Action of the Scene and answer an important moral End for by how much he endears to us the inestimable Blessing of Sleep by so much he aggravates the atrocious Crime of Murder from the Commission whereof  Macbeth  is but just returned Observe too the first Epithet which he gives to Sleep  innocent  it is very copious It not only implies that Sleep is innocent in itself that while we  sleep we are free from Guilt but that Sleep most naturally dwells with innocent and undisturbed Minds  I have no doubt but I shall dream of you tonight for I have been dreaming of you all Day I shall write you again on Sunday and include a small Missive to Mr K which you will deliver when you think fit Give my humble Service to your Mama and Aunt and believe me to be most truly  your Friend J P  LETTER VIII  Oxford  Nov    My dear Nancy  I Wrote to you from  Wickham  which I hope is come to your Hand I have little to say at present only that I am well  having arrived here safe and found on Saturday about three o'clock  I have enclosed a Letter to Mr K which you need not deliver till you have Occasion for a Recruit of Cash I shall endeavour to get some Franks for you Let me know when you meet with a  Spencer  to your Mind though I think you have so many Books already to read and consider that you need not be over hasty  Go on with your Observations on the  Illiad  and write to me soon When you sit down to write you should be at Leisure have a Disposition for it have the Subject digested in your Mind be in a chearful complying Humour have a good Pen good Ink and good Paper and  place yourself in an easy and convenient Posture All these Things will make you write so as to please and even make the Hand itself more agreeable  My humble Service to your Mama and Aunt and be assured that I am  my dear Angel  your most affectionate and faithful Friend J P  LETTER XXXII  Oxford  Nov    My dear Nancy  I HAD the Pleasure of yours of the th the next Day after it was written I have very little to say at present  and believe I should not write at all till another Occasion were it not for the Pleasure I take in conversing with you and for fear you should think I forget you which I never do  I greatly approve your not going to Mr K till you have an absolute Occasion for that was the Purpose of giving you the Credit You know my dear young as you are I have not scrupled to acquaint you exactly what I hold in trust for you and it would be Folly to lavish away in Trifles what is meant for material Uses besides you would neither have the Satisfaction nor Advantage that I intend if you were to misemploy your little Fortune But I am counselling one who wants no Advice in these Points My  Letter of Credit is not in Force till tomorrow but you did not know that and I am pleased you did not as in that Case your postponing your Claim had been the Consequence of my Advice which is now the Result of your own Prudence Purchase the Capuchin you mention if you have a Fancy for it be the Price what it may There is no Occasion for a trifling Oeconomy in Matters which are real Necessaries of Life To retrench in Superfluities is our chief Duty and ought to be our constant Care Were this Point generally attended to I believe moderate Incomes would go much farther than they do at present  Have you made the Improvements in your Apparel which I recommended Have you seen your agreeable Acquaintance  How does she How do your Aunt and Mother Tell me all that relates to you though in the most distant Degree  I am just now going to read a Book of the  Iliad  that I may be the better enabled to converse with you on that Subject  Adieu ma très chere petite Ange et sois bien et assurement persuadée que  Je suis votre très fidelle Ami J P  LETTER XXXIII  Oxford  Dec    My dear Nancy  I Should begin this Letter with  Homer  and proceed in Form and Order but I have so many Letters to write this Day  that I dare not venture on it I shall only mark out two or three Passages in the Fourth Book of the  Iliad  which I have just now read and which I think peculiarly fine  The first is at Line  As when the fleecy Flocks unnumber'd stand  In wealthy Folds and wait the Milker's Hand  The hollow Vales incessant Bleating fills  The Lambs reply from all the neighb'ring Hills  The second is at Line  As Torrents roll increas'd by num'rous Rills  With Rage impetuous down their echoing Hills  Rush to the Vales and pour'd along the Plain  Roar thro' a thousand Channels to the Main  The distant Shepherd trembling hears the Sound  So mix both Hosts and so their Cries rebound  These are two fine Comparisons and at the same Time are noble Descriptions I the rather quote them to you because you might possibly pass them over without regarding them so much as you never saw the Originals of which these Descriptions are a Picture but if you had seen them as I have often done being born and bred up all my younger Days in a very mountainous Country you would own that nothing can be more natural or beautiful  To understand the first Comparison rightly it is necessary to know that when the Lambs arrive at a certain Age they are weaned and put in a separate Flock by themselves The Ewes are put in Folds to be milked That reciprocal  Desire which the Ewes and Lambs have to be together makes them bleat incessantly and when within hearing they regularly answer each other those Sounds the Hillsecho back and fill the whole Valleys or Glens as we call them in  Scotland  with a very agreeable Noise even Musick is scarcely more agreeable at least to me  How exceedingly fine is the Description of Discord Line  Small at her Birth and rising every Hour  c  This is very judiciously placed where  he Grecians and Trojans who were  early reconciled dissent again The Colouring suits the Nature of Discord or  trife admirably which often arises  from very small Beginnings perhaps from a meer Trifle and to what a monstrous Height does it sometimes grow It reminds me of what Solomon says  The Beginning of Strife is like the letting in of Water  for if we will make but a small Passage for Water to enter at it will itself enlarge it sufficiently We have this expressive Proverb in  Scotland  The Mother of Mischief is no greater than a Midge's Wing  that is a Gnat's Wingintimating how small a Circumstance how worthless and inconsiderable may occasion much Contention and great Mischief  The Moral on the whole is  Avoid Strife as much as possible  and as the Apostle says excellently  Seek Peace with all Men  Adieu  my dearest Nancy  I am your faithful Friend J P  P S  I forgot to remark to you that the Description of the Storm and Torrents breaking down the Sides of the Hills in the Twelfth Book of the  Aeneid  are admirably painted  LETTER XXXIV  Oxford  Dec    My dear Nancy  I HAD a Letter from you by yesterday's Post which gave me great Pleasure  I should now begin to explain to you the Nature of the  Iliad  the  Odyssey  and the  Aeneid  but I do not know if you have yet made any Progress in the admirable Treatise on Epick Poetry by  Monsieur Bossu  If you have read and marked him attentively I could omit many Things as needless and yet write a great deal more that you would understand and be pleased with But this would not be proper before you have read that compleat Treatise which unfolds the whole Art and Mystery of the Epick Poem  Mr  Pope  I think says that the  Iliad  points out the Effects of Anger the  Odyssey  those of Patience and Wisdom The Effects of Anger and Resentment are  rash mad and foolish Actions tending to Misery and Destruction The Effects of Patience and long Suffering are welladvised Actions terminating in the Accomplishment of our Wishes and leading to Happiness  Horace  who knew Mankind as well perhaps as any Man who lived before or since his Time except some few whom we meet in the Holy Writings says that "He who violently hastens his Revenge renders the very End he would attain ineffectual" The  Iliad  and  Odyssey  are two great Examples of the Truth of this In the former we see the Rage and Resentment of  Achilles  and  Agamemnon  frustrate the very Design for which they came to  Troy  to wit the Destruction of the Town What Miseries did they not occasion What loss of gallant Men And  Achilles  who  even got the better in the Contest between him and  Agamemnon  paid dear for it in the Loss of his beloved  Patroclus  What though he had the Satifaction or rather Triumph of killing  Hector  a much worthier Man than himself yet that did not remove his Grief and Misery for after that we still find him in the Agonies of Sorrow so true is it that even when our blind and mad Desires are granted we find ourselves as far from Happiness as we were before Again what did the Satisfaction of killing  Hector  cost him In the first Place we see he was forced to forego the savage Pleasure he took in abusing the Body of that illustrious Chief in spite of his Teeth as we say  Jove  compelled him to forego it He was even obliged to do honour to the  Corpse Furthermore we find his own Fate was attached to that of  Hector Hector  told him at his Death  the Gods would not let his Death pass unrevenged  Apollo  accordingly met  Achilles  at the  Scean  Gate and revenged it home and to his utter Disgrace made him fall at last by a far less worthy Hand than that of  Hector  I shall take Notice of this Particular more at length in some following Letter All I shall add at present is that it is true we have not such Thunder and Lightning so great an Eclat such bold Characters such Force such Grandeur and Majesty in the  Odyssey  as in the  Iliad  yet the  Archbishop of Cambray  observes that the Antients at least the best Judges and Criticks of Antiquity do not give  the  Iliad  the Preference I shall not repeat what he says on that Head but refer you to his own Words they are in the  Dialogues des Morts  Adieu  my dear Nancy  I am your unfeigned Friend J P  LETTER XXXV  Oxford  Dec    My dear  YEsterday's Post brought me yours of the th in which your Hurry makes you leave out some Words and misplace others this I wish you to guard against It is a Neglect unworthy of you  Before you proceed in the  Iliad  I must beg you to read  Bossu  at least some Chapters in the Beginning of his admirable Treatise They will give you a proper Idea of the Nature and Plan of this and every other Heroick Poem There is also a short Discourse on Epick Poetry prefixed to the last English Translation of  Telemaque  which is well worth your Attention though I cannot agree with the Writer in preferring  Telemaque  to  Homer  and  Virgil  I do not recommend these Books in order to make you a nice Critick but to enable you to read such Works as the  Iliad Odyssey Aeneid Paradise Lost  and  Telemachus  with greater Pleasure and Profit You may add to the List  Tosso  's  Jerusalem  which I have just finished a fine Poem indeed and admirably translated and  Ramsay  's  Travels of Cyrus  about which we will talk when I come to Town  There are several other Works some of which you have that will be of great Service towards forming a true Idea of those noble Authors and likewise of all other kinds of Poetry such as  Aristotle  's  Art of Poetry Roscommon on Translated Verse Horace Vida  and the  Duke of Buckkingham  's  Art of Poetry Rapin  's and  Dacier  's  Discourses on Eloquence and Poetry Dryden  's and  Pope  's  Discourses Pope  's  Art of Criticism  the most excellent  Archbishop of Cambray  's  Discourse on Eloquence  and the  Spectators on Milton Congreve  's  Letter on Humour  is also most excellent and  judicious so are  Dr Trapp  's  Discourses on Virgil  These Writings will give you a true Notion of Tragedy Comedy Satire Pastoral Ode Elegy and Song as well as of Epick Poetry which last indeed together with Tragedy and Comedy are the three great Species of Poetry  I will now suppose that you have formed or procured a right Notion of the Nature of an Heroick Poem and of the Action that it must be one great intire marvelous but not incredible Piece of a just Length instructive and entertaining I will presume likewise that you have a Notion of the Characters Manners Sentiment and Diction and of the ornamental Aid of Figures Episodes Descriptions and Similes or Comparisons  by which those Characters and Manners are set off to Advantage  This being all presupposed let us enquire what  Homer  proposes to do in his two matchless Poems and then examine the End and Tendency of that Proposition  We will begin with the  Iliad  Mr  Pope  says that the Subject of the  Iliad  is the shortest that ever was undertaken namely the Anger of  Achilles  Mr  Dryden  if I am not mistaken says that  Virgil  's Proposition or Subject is far preferable to the former The one is the Anger of  Achilles  the other is the Establishment of a noble Empire the noblest perhaps that the World ever saw  Now I cannot agree altogether either with  Pope  or  Dryden  for in the first Instance it is not the Anger of  Achilles  simply considered that  Homer  proposes for the Business of his Poem but the Delays Disappointments and Calamities which attended the Greeks in Consequence of the Anger and Resentment of  Achilles  This is the Plan which he lays down and on which he promises to proceed and the particular Moral that naturally arises from it is the most proper and useful that could be offered to his Countrymen The Grecians were composed of many little States it was therefore their Interest to be unanimous and closely united when engaged in a common Cause How apt then was his Moral He wished them to learn that their Safety  consisted in their Union and that Discord and Dissension would be their Ruin this was in the Course of Time actually verified  Philip  of  Macedon  overthrew and enslaved them and the Means he pursued to bring it about was first by sowing Dissension among them and dividing one State from the other So divided he found them an easy Conquest The same Thing has happened a thousand Times since not only in sovereign States and Kingdoms but even in private Families One of our Saviour's Tenets is  A Kingdom divided against itself cannot stand  and this is the grand Moral which arises out of the particular Subject of the  Iliad  In the next Place if we consider the Tendency of the Poem I do not see but  it may be deemed of as great Consequence as that of the  Aeneid  though it may not be so speciously agreeable The Tendency of the one is to shew by what Means Degrees and worthy Qualities a mighty Empire was founded The Tendency of the other to point out the Misconduct the Vices and Follies by which a great Undertaking was almost ruined and indeed had been entirely so but for an extraordinary Accident and the whole Force of  Greece  overpowered This last is surely as useful a Lesson as the first and strictly justifiable in  Homer  inasmuch as he proposed to write another Poem wherein he was to demonstrate the great and good Effects of Virtue for such is the Purport of the  Odyssey  I think it is Mr  Addison  who says that beside the grand particular Moral that arises out of an Epick Poem or that which the Poet had chiefly in view there are many others which contingently result from the Fable This is certainly true it appears manifestly in  Homer  and perhaps it was as much his Intention to shew these as the great Moral abovementioned In my ensuing Letters I will occasionally mark out some of these and describe what I conjecture to be the greatuniversal Intention of the Author At present I fear I haved tired you so shall trouble you no more for two or three Days  Adieu  ma très chere  J P  LETTER XXXVI  Oxford  Dec    My dear Nancy  I HAVE some few Remarks to

Poet and the Prophet  I am  my dear Nancy  le votre J P  LETTER XXXVII  Oxford  Dec    My dear Nancy  BY yesterday's Post I received yours of the th but cannot much commend the Writing I do not desire you to write me when you are in so very great a Hurry rather put it off till you have more Leisure  I shall not trouble you with a long Letter of Particulars at present but give you my Opinion of the  Iliad  in general  Beside the great Moral thereof there are many other Things which the Conduct of the Poem was meant to set forth  We are shewn the ill Effects of unlawful Love vain Glory Pride Injustice Breach of Faith Dissimulation Cowardice Covetousness  c  for Instance in  Paris Agamemnon Asius Pandarus Dolon  and many others Hence as the  particular  Intent of this wonderful Poem is to shew the fatal Consequences of Dissension and Anger among Princes so the main and general Design seems calculated to point out the bad Effects of ungoverned Passions and Appetites in all Mankind to set forth that our giving way to them leads into Sin that one Sin leads into another and the whole into Misery and Punishment  The great Moral arising from it is to give it you in the Greek    that is to say "So the Counsel of the Gods was perfected or fulfilled" This is the very Beginning of the  Iliad  and Mr  Pope  has translated it  Such was the sov'reign Will and such the Deom of  Jove  But  Homer  is much shorter more simple and sublime for  does not only signify  Will  but  Counsel  and  wise Determination  hereby teaching us that Misery is the Consequence of illgoverned Passions and according to the stated Nature of Things it must be so How agreeable is this to the Spirit of the sacred Scriptures where it is said  The Counsel of the Lord endureth for ever but the Counsel of the wicked shall be brought to nought  I was very well pleased the other Day when I found the above Sentence called in  Pope  's Notes the  grand Moral  of the Poem for in Truth though I had always thought so I did not know that any one had said it  Adieu  my dear  J P  LETTER XXXVIII  Oxford  Dec    My dear Nancy  I Wrote to you yesterday and having now a leisure Afternoon I shall continue the same Subject  Homer  shews us there is a necessary natural Connection between giving way to our inordinate Appetites and Affections and transgressing our Duty to God and Man and thence a consequential Tendency to Misery and Punishment It is in this Sense that one of the minor Prophets fays "Is there Evil in the City and the Lord hath not done it" teaching us thereby that no Mischief or Evil befalls an impious City or People but what happens by the wise Counsel and Will of God  There are two Ways whereby the great Author of the  Iliad  shews us the Connection between Misery and Sin and between Sin and inordinate Affections The one is the natural Connection we  have before observed the other the immediate Vengeance of God proceeding from his Displeasure Of these we  without Number both in  and  Holy Writings for  the P  gues of  Aegypt  are such a  Paral  el that one would almost  Homer  had copied from  Moses  and  Madame  acier  have observed that the Gradation of Punishments related by  Moses  is imitated by the other and in both the long Suffering and Goodness of God is remarkable In the  Iliad  first the Dogs then the Fowls of the Air then the Cattle lastly the People themselves were smitten with the Darts of  Apollo  In the Scripture the Lice the Locusts the Flies c preceded the cutting off the firstborn But  I need not say more on this Head only refer to the Passages and indeed many other Poets as well as  Homer  abound with Examples of this Kind  The next Thing to be pointed out my dear is how admirably the Greek Poet has made inordinate Affections beget Offences to God and Injuries to Man and how naturally and clearly he has made Miseries and Punishments arise out of the former But I will not detain you longer now than to with you Health and Happiness and that you may improve these Things not less to your Advantage than to your Pleasure  Adieu  my dear Nancy  I am always yours J P  LETTER XXXIX  Oxford  Dec    My dear  I Wrote you on Friday the th and thought I might possibly hear from you on Sunday but perhaps my Letter did not come Time enough to your Hand  Mr  Pope  has observed that through the  Iliad Homer  has in a Manner made every thing done by Divine Providence Some Deity always assists the Hero who gets the better except  Ajax  alone When  Hector  breaks through the Grecian Wall and sets fire to their Ships  Jupiter  assists him When he is killed  Jupiter  has abandoned him and  Pallas  assists  Achilles  In a Word in all Encounters and in all Actions where any Point is to be gained by Valour Courage or Wisdom the supreme Power assists in Defeat and Disappointment that Power deserts them How conformable still to the holy Writings where God is said "To put Wisdom into the Heart to strengthen it" and on the contrary "To make blind and to harden the Heart"  Virgil  has often said that such and such an Event came about by Chance by the Vicissitude of Fortune and by the Instability of human Affairs Perhaps he meant the same with  Homer  since he has often mentioned the Fates or Decrees  of the Gods in very express Terms though his Meaning is not so clearly pointed but  Homer  is peculiarly strict in his Expressions for he always makes the Will or Counsel of the Supreme to be the Disposer of every thing by which we may learn what worthy Sentiments he had of the true God and that all Things must be regulated by his wise Counsel howsoever they may appear mere Chance to  us  who by reason of our human Blindness and Weakness can neither foresee nor avoid Thousands of Events that fall out every Day and every Hour  This perhaps you will reckon a Digression and it is so but it opens  the Way to what I shall write you in my next  I am  my dear Nancy  your real Friend J P  P S  After writing the above I have received yours and shall answer it tomorrow or next Day  LETTER XL  Oxford  Dec    Dear Nancy  HOMER's Intention as I have observed before is to shew us that inordinate Affections lead to Sin and Sin to Misery He gives us a hundred  Instances to prove this but the chief is  The Wrath of Achilles  The great Design and Tendency of the  Iliad  is repeatedly set forth and illustrated by Mr  Preston  yet I cannot presume it was through Inadvertency to what he had once said it was certainly his Intention so to do in order to make a strong and lasting Impression on his Pupil's Mind    Beside the Instances themselves the beautiful Order and natural Connection in which he disposes them fully illustrate his Proposition and from the whole Tenor of his Story this Conclusion naturally arises that the Counsel and wise Disposition of God is fulfilled in every thing Mr  Pope  has shewed this in his Notes on many particular Passages throughout the  Iliad  but if we take a short View of the Fable or Story  we shall then see it in the clearest Light  Though the Author begins with the  Wrath of Achilles  yet in the Course of his Works he takes care to shew us the Source of  all  the Miseries which he has painted in his most admirable Poem  Paris  was a Youth of royal Blood beautiful and amorous he sung and played he seduced from her Husband the most beautiful Woman in the World perhaps as amorous as himself Her Husband who had hospitably entertained him resents this Usage he asks the Assistance of his Friends and the neighbouring States They sail to  Troy  destroy  the Country and at last sit down before the Town The Daughter to the Priest of  Apollo  was made a Captive Her Father goes to redeem her  Agamemnon  refuses his most just Suit threatens and illtreats him The Priest complains to his God who sends Plagues first upon the Grecian Cattle then upon the People The Causes hereof are enquired the Prophet is afraid of the King but being assured of Protection from  Achilles  proclaims aloud the Cause of the Displeasure of Heaven  Agamemnon  insults him Hereupon a Contest ensues between  Agamemnon  and  Achilles  wherein they illtreat each other  Agamemnon  threatens to take  Achilles  's Captive  Briseis  from him and actually does it on which  Achilles  refuses to  fight for the  Grecians  The  Trojans  obtain many Advantages by this Refusal A Duel is proposed by  Paris  and accepted on the Terms proposed  Menelaus  is treacherously wounded The  Trojans  refuse to restore  Helen  or stand to the Terms agreed on and though  Priam  was certainly of the same Opinion with  Antenor  that she ought to be given up yet through Indulgence to his Son he subscribes to a Breach of the Agreement Hereupon Battle on Battle ensues Both  Greeks  and  Trojans  are miserably destroyed and consequently many Proofs are given of Courage Wisdom Piety Constancy Patience Friendship and Compassion as also of Cowardice Rashness Brutality Vanity Cruelty and almost of all Virtues and Vices The several  Incidents are managed with great Address Honourable Embassies are sent to  Achilles  to return to the Service of the  Greeks  He is inexorable till  Hector  kills his Friend This gets the better of his Resolutions he returns to the Fight from a Principle of Revenge and kills  Hector  Adieu  J P  LETTER XLI  Oxford  Dec    My dear  IN my last I gave you a short Summary or Argument of the whole Fable of the  Iliad  which is so nicely connected one Incident or Circumstance  so naturally and orderly depending on another that each Part serves to strengthen and illustrate the other and the whole leads to a Demonstration of the Author's first Proposition to wit that the Wrath of  Achilles  occasioned many and grievous Miseries to the  Greeks  Hence we are taught that Strife and Dissention as I have observed before are the certain Ruin of any common Cause State Kingdom or Family that inordinate Affections lead to Vice that Vice increases in its Course insomuch that one Sin if I may be allowed the Expression begets another and consequently such Persons as give way to their Passions and Lusts become gradually degenerate fall from bad to worse till they are irrecoverably plunged in Guilt and Unhappiness  Homer  shews us also that the Wrath of God hangs over the Head of the wicked whether a Nation King or private Person God sends his Judgments upon them withdraws his Assistance fights against them sends judicial Blindness and Hardness of Heart upon them and assists their Enemies to overthrow them who in executing the secret Will of Heaven are themselves sometimes guilty of the same Crimes he made them the Instruments to punish and are in their Turn chastized  On the other Hand he shews how much good Men engaged in a righteous Cause are favoured by Heaven The Way to obtain this Favour he points  out to be by supplicating and serving God and the Return to be made by Thankfulness and Praise  In my next I shall illustrate all this from the Summary of the Poet's Fable  I am  my dear Nancy  your affectionate Friend J P  LETTER XLII  Oxford  Dec    My dear Nancy  I Received your Letter written on ChristmasDay and wrote to you the Day after that Date but I had sealed mine before yours came to hand so did not chuse to open it  I told you in my last except one that  Homer  's Purpose in his  Iliad  is to shew us that inordinate ungoverned unrestrained Passions and Appetites are the Means of leading us into Sin and consequently into Misery and that the Order and Connection of the Story helps to set this Position in the strongest Light I gave you likewise a short Sketch or Argument of the  Iliad  Now let me comment a little on it and we shall thereby not only see  Homer  's great and accurate Judgment but discover some very valuable Truths on which if we will well observe and improve happy will it be for him or her who does it  The Source of all this Mischief the Destruction of  Troy  and of the whole  royal Race of that Kingdom of infinite Woes and Miseries to their Allies as well as to the Grecians was  an unlawful Amour  The Cause which  Homer  assigns to wit  The Wrath of Achilles against Agamemnon  is but an intervening not the original Cause  The Seduction of Helen  and Breach of Hospitality in carrying her off during her Husband's Absence that Husband who had entertained the Seducer kindly who was a Person too of such Distinction no less than a King these I say were the original Source of all those Woes and Devastations  Here we cannot but admire the Judgment of  Homer  and the Excellency of his Fable  Paris  was a King's Son  Helen  a Queen two of the handsomest Persons in the known World  Homer  would teach us herein that handsome Men and Women are subject to much greater Inconveniencies of this kind than others Such a Man has great Advantages over the fair Sex and such Women are more liable to Flattery and the Danger of having their Morals spoiled by false Suggestions of intriguing Men who never fail when they meet with a Woman of Virtue to endeavour to reason her out of it before they can hope for Success Not half so much Pains is ordinarily taken on Women who are but homely and we see daily that more fine Women are ruined than others  Homer  chose for his Purpose two Persons of such exalted Condition so highly  bred alike possessed of some Virtues and yet made the Crime very black for the following Reasons  Had they been Persons of mean Degree or abandoned Principles they would not have made so deep an Impression on our Minds nor should we have had that Care or Concern at least not that Pity for them which in the present Case we feel every now and then to return upon us  If  Paris  had been a downright Ruffian and  Helen  a low dissolute Wretch they could not have been of any Use to the Poet then or to us now What can be learned from two People quite sunk in Debauchery But these though bad enough had yet great Remorses at least  Helen  and  Paris  was not a Ruffian though he was a Seducer Now where some good Qualities are mixed with bad where Virtue and Sin struggle together and sometimes Honour sometimes natural Frailty gets the better the Poet can shew Humankind as it is and place it in a very instructive Light otherwise he cannot  It was absolutely necessary to make the Crime very provoking and the Person injured of a very distinguished Character else the Poet could not with any due Probability have brought all  Greece  together in Arms to revenge the Injury Had  Helen  been a Person of mean Degree Kings and Princes would not have leagued together to resent her Husband's  Wrongs had the Injury been slight it could not have borne a Quarrel nor could  Homer  have vindicated his Greeks whom he is so fond of nor the Gods themselves had he built his beautiful Poem on a slight Event Again if  Paris  had been of low Extraction whom could the Greeks fight against Not  Troy  for the whole State and their Allies could not have engaged in the Defence of one who was less then a King's Son In the one Case  Homer  could not have had his Greeks to fight in the other he could nor have had the Trojans to fight against On the whole therefore I hope you will agree with me that the Bard was most judicious in chusing two Persons of great Distinction of great Beauty and guilty of a great Crime to be the Originals  whereon to found his excellent moral Poem  Adieu  ma Charmante  J P  LETTER XLIII  Oxford  Jan    My dear  I Have the Pleasure of yours of the d and am very glad to hear you are in good Health I presume both your Aunt and Mother are well since you mention nothing to the contrary  It would be very agreeable to me that you write of the  Odyssey  Your last Letter on  Homer  was of the th of  December  so that Correspondence has been  long suspended In my next I shall resume my Observations on the  Iliad  but shall now contract them as much as possible there being many Things in Mr  Pope  's Remarks which anticipate what I should otherwise have observed  I did indeed expect a longer Letter from you at least two or three short onesa Method that I shall pursue hereafter Nothing damps the Spirit wherewith a Correspondence should be kept alive so much as neglecting to write a little because you have not Leisure for a great deal Remember this Maxim and pursue it  My humble Service and believe me to be my dear little Angel  Your sincere Friend J P  LETTER XLIV  Oxon  Jan    My dear Nancy  PUrsuant to my Promise of yesterday I sit down to give you only a short Letter I now return to  Homer  I would have you read over my former Observations on this Subject when you peruse this Letter In the tenth Year of the War between the two Nations we have seen the  Greeks  sit down  before  Troy Homer  's Poem begins here and the Circumstance wherewith he opens it is the Dissention which happens between  Agamemnon  and  Achilles  This fatal Difference had almost ruined the  Greeks  It arose you remember from  Agamemnon  's Refusal to accept Ransom for the Priest of  Apollo  's Daughter only because he loved her better than his own Wife He affronts the Priest abuses and threatens the Augur  Calchas  calling him a false Interpreter of the Will of Heaven Hereupon a Quarrel arises between the King and  Achilles  They insult and defy each other till in the End  Agamemnon  takes from him his Captive Briseis  What we have to remark on this Event is well worth Notice we see  Agamemnon  fall into the very Crime which he came to revenge How highly natural There is nothing more common in ordinary Life than to stumble into the same Faults and Errors for which we condemn others How blind and partial are we to ourselves How quicksighted to those around us Both Men and Women are equally culpable in this Respect You remember  Congreve  's  Amoret  She loves herself yet others hates  For that which in herself she prizes  Adieu  ma très chere  J P  LETTER XLV  Oxford  Jan    My dear  THOSE human Frailties I was upon in my last Partiality to ourselves and Uncharitableness to our Neighbour are the Causes of more than half the Mischief that happens in the World Hence it was that our  Saviour  perpetually preached the NonResentment and Forgiveness of Offences Nothing can so much contribute to the Peace of Mankind To return to  Homer  We see this inordinate Affection in  Agamemnon  betrayed him into Passion Rudeness and Injustice and these  brought on Misery What Insults did he not undergo What stinging Reproaches did he not endure To what Grief Shame and Repentance was he not exposed In what Calamities did he not involve his Army How was he constrained to court and sue to  Achilles  And how were his Supplications rejected and his Proffers scorned Here is a natural Connection between his Crime and the sad Effects of it  Observe likewise his Crime was not only punished in its own Consequences but by the absolute Interposition of Heaven The Plague is sent upon the  Greeks  and Burials are heaped on Burials This is exactly conformable to what our holy Religion teaches namely that one Sin naturally draws on another  and that the End and Wages of Sin are Death or Misery Beside this inherent Punishment God sometimes sends immediate Vengeance Being essentially merciful he begins with milder Judgments but upon Obstinacy and Impenitence he pours forth the Fullness of his Wrath In  Pope  's Notes you see the Conformity of the Procedure in this Plague to that inflicted on  Pharaoh  It is observable that  Agamemnon  fell into a Crime of the same Nature with that of  Paris  but not near so heinous in Degree the Punishments therefore were only proportionable  Troy  was utterly destroyed for the atrocious Crime of that People and their obstinate Continuance in it The  Greeks  suffered severely  but were not destroyed forasmuch as their Crime or Perseverance therein was not so flagrant  We gather also from this excellent Poem that People are oft involved in the Vices and Punishments of their Princes A wicked King is not only a Plague in himself to his Subjects but in his Sins he calls down Judgments upon them This is confirmed in the Scriptures as well as in  Homer  For instance in the d Book of  Kings  Chap xxiv we read  Surely at the Commandment of the  Lord  came this upon  Judah  to remove them out of his Sight for the Sins of  Manasseh  according to all that he did  And also for the innocent Blood that he shed for he filled  Jerusalem  with innocent Blood which the  Lord  would not pardon  The holy Writings teach us that Children are punished for the Faults of their Parents  Homer  shews us the same  We often see Children unaccountably as far as Appearance goes involved in the Faults of their Parents and suffering on their Account it appears strange at first but on due Reflection we must allow there is nothing more natural in the common Course of Things than that the Sins of a Parent should fall heavy on a Child There is such a Connection between them the one is so much a  Part of the other that this Consequence can hardly be avoided at least in many Instances  The Scriptures teach us that  God  makes one People the Instrument of his Vengeance on another and again contrarywise  Ephraim  shall destroy  Manasseh  and  Manasseh Ephraim    and it is said to the People of  Israel  You shall be a Scourge and a Plague to the Heathen that are about you and they shall be a Scourge to you  Nothing can be more natural or more just with respect to two guilty Nations  Homer  enforces the same the  Trojans  and  Greeks  are both guilty but not  equally they are both punished but not equally only in Proportion to the Size and Aggravation of their Crimes and they were made reciprocally the Means of each other's Punishment Through the whole Bible particularly in the Prophets and more especially in  Isaiah  and  Jeremiah  this Doctrine is strongly inculcated  How amazingly great then is  Homer  We find a Heathen through the Strength and Justness of his own Conceptions and Sentiments agree almost in every Point with "the Word of God" And by the Tenor of the whole his  grande Morale  is fully evinced namely    The Counsel of God was accomplished  I wish you Health and Happiness Believe me to be  My dear Angel  your J P  LETTER XLVI  Oxford  Jan    My dear Nancy  I'LL let  Homer  stand still a while and give you a short Description of  Oxford  On the Road from  London  we come first within Sight of the City at about two Miles Distance on the Top of a pretty high Hill called  ShootoverHill  Here we have a View of the River with  the plain Country embanking it and on either Hand a Range of Hills The River below  Oxford  is called the  Thames  but at  Oxford  there are two Rivers that on the West is called the  Isis  that on East the  Cherwell  The one comes from the North the other to wit  Isis  from the North West They meet at  Oxford  which stands in the Point between them on a little rising Ground surrounded with Rivers and Meadows on the East West and South and with fine Corn Fields on the North Beyond those Meadows and Rivers are two Tracts of pretty high Hills covered with Pasture Corn and Woods intermixed When you come within View of the Town from  ShootoverHill  it strikes you very agreeably with a great Number of public Buildings  such as Churches Colleges Schools the Theatre PrintingHouse Dr  Ratcliffe  's Library  c  Just as you enter  Oxford  from  London  you cross the  Cherwell  by a Bridge thence ascend gradually to the Middle of the Town then you descend as gradually till you come to the  Isis  over which you pass by several Bridges The many Canals into which these two Rivers have been cut have been the Occasion of so many Bridges about  Oxford  Their private Buildings are but ordinary but the great Number of public Buildings the Squares Avenues of Trees the Gardens Groves fine Walks and beautiful Country around make it a  most delightful Place in Summer The Streets for the chief Part are clean and dry  This Description though but faint is enough to give you a Sort of Taste of the Beauties of  Oxford  If you wish to be more particularly informed let me know and I will do the best I can to satisfy you I subjoin a Sort of Sketch or Plan of  Oxford  Drawn very correctly though with his Pen only a strong Instance of his assiduous Kindness and probably more valuable to his Pupil than the most accurate and beautiful Engraving  as well as I am able to give it I should have told you that the two Rivers are very unlike each other the  Cherwell  is deep flow and muddy with many Turnings and Windings the Banks overgrown consequently  the Water not easily to be come at in many Places The  Isis  has a strait Course runs pretty swift the Water clear the Bottom gravelly and firm and the Banks smooth clean and disengaged from Woods or Shrubs  Adieu  my dear Angel  I am yours J P  LETTER XLVII  Oxon  Feb    My Dear  I Received yours of the st of this Month on the Day thereafter and in Return will endeavour to gratify your Curiosity respecting this City  The  University  here is one of the most famous in the World it is a Place for Education in all the liberal Sciences For this Purpose there are no less than seventy Colleges and five or six Halls where Instructors in these respective Branches reside namely for Divinity Logic Physic Anatomy Astronomy Law Rhetoric and Languages Each of these Colleges is a Building by itself and many of them are very stately Each is likewise a separate Society by itself governed by its own Laws and Customs under its own particular Charter and the whole incorporated into one great Body is called the  University  Hence they derive great Privileges The City of  Oxford  is subject to them they send Members to Parliament and every College  has a particular Founder as a King Queen or other distinguished Personage  Those who have built and first settled Endowments on Colleges are called the Founders those who have left Sums of Money Lands or Books since their Foundation are stiled Benefactors  The Halls were originally Buildings belonging to some particular Colleges though separated from them and were erected for the Conveniency of lodging Students when the Colleges were too much crowded or for the Reception of the Sons of great Men who did not like to be confined to strict CollegeHours But now Things are altered  Some of the Halls have been turned into Colleges and others are wholly independent of them  You desire perhaps to know the Difference between these Buildings  A College is a Body corporate within themselves who have a Charter of their own and can buy and sell take and enjoy by Gift or Legacy in their own Name The Charter is a Grant from the King  A Hall has one Head or Chief in the same Manner as a College and like that is also a Part of the University It has its own Rules Orders and Government but no Charter consequently is  not a Body Corporate within itself The Society possess no Lands nor Rents nor can they take and enjoy like a College in their own Name When any thing is given or bequeathed for their Use they cannot

the great and important Subject of  Homer  's Poem was to be admired but also his judicious Manner of conducting it and the Beauty of the whole Contexture of his Fable or Story whence it is not only pleasant as well as profitable but from being pleasant it makes a deeper Impression on our Memories and we recollect it with continual Satisfaction  The Writer seems admirably to have adopted this agreeable Precept in his own Practice He catches hold of every Opportunity to throw in that Simplicity and Playfulness which make Instruction most engaging A Tribute of this Kind is paid to the Memory of Mr  Savage  in an elegant Latin Inscription in the Cloister of  Westminster Abbey  The Monument is said to be erected by the Scholar of that Foundation From this Inscription I have taken my Motto for this Work the Turn of it being so immediately adapted to our Tutor's Disposition May I be forgiven if I here subjoin the whole and presume to add an humble Imitation of it in English which I have been induced to attempt merely from the Delight I have taken in the Original  INSCRIPTION  Tu nostrae Memor usque Scholae dum Vita manebat  Musa nec immemores nos sinit esse tui  Ipse Loei Genius te moeret Amicus Amicum  Et Luctu Pietas not propiare ferit  Nobiscum assueras docto puerascere Lusu  Fudit ingenitos cruda Senecta Sales  Chare Senex Puer hoc te saltem Carmine donat  Ingratum Pueri nec

As Friend for Friend laments in mournful Strains  And Piety but aggravates our Pains  How wouldst thou sport with us in learned Play  And sage Advice in Wit's light Strains convey  A Pupil gives this grateful Verse to thee  Nor can a Pupil's Verse unwelcome be    Homer  has made use of wonderful Stratagems for this Purpose The Enumeration of the Ships the Names of the Commanders the geographical Description of the several Countries they came from the characteristic Distinction of the Leaders the nice Plot contrived to give us an Idea even of the Make and Shape of their Persons in bringing  Helen  to describe them to old  Priam  the engaging of  Paris  and  Menelaus  first then of  Ajax  and  Hector  in single Battle the manifest Advantage he gives to  Menelaus  and a sort of Advantage to  Ajax  though not great the  Trojans  breaking  the Truce wounding  Menelaus  and refusing to restore  Helen  All these serve to vindicate the Greeks and ascribe Blame to the Trojans  Observe that though several of the Grecian Heroes have now and then the Advantage over  Hector  yet he in his Turn has the Advantage over every one of them This is that the Poet may give the greater Honour to  Achilles  who is the only Man designed at last to conquer  Hector  and not even then without the Assistance of a Deity nor till Heaven had abandoned  Hector  We see too that  Hector  though the best Man among all the Heroes either Greek or Trojan and the Man whom  Jupiter  loves for his Piety and other Virtues was yet involved  in the common Calamity He fought 'tis true from Love to his Country and Family but he fought on the wrong Side How agreeable this to the holy Scripture There we find national Sins draw down Judgments on such particular Persons as are no Matter by what Means involved therein  The Case of good old  Priam  seems to be the same with that of good old  Eli  Though  Priam  approved not of his Son  Paris  's Crime yet he was indulgent to him and did not compel him to do Justice Herein his Default was parallel to that of  Eli  of whom the Lord says to  Samuel  I will judge his House for ever for the Iniquity which he knoweth because  his Sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not  Sam  B I C i Ver  It is worth your while to read this whole Chapter and that preceding it  In Mr  Pope  's Notes you will read the several Instances of  Homer  's Judgment in the whole Conduct of his Story so I need not repeat them I shall mention only two  You know it is a Proof of great Judgment in a Poet to suit every Circumstance with Propriety and to make his Personages act in Character There is an Instance of the former when  Homer  to relieve us from the Fury of a Battle  brings in his Heroes in a sort of Parley as that between  Glaucus  and  Diomede  to which I refer you Another Instance is in his fit Disposal of Time as Mr  Pope  has observed in that busy Night which preceded  Hector  's breaking in upon the Grecian Intrenchments  To illustrate his Persons acting up to Character consider the Care and Concern  Nestor  is in when the Embassy is sent to  Achilles  You know the Embassadors were  Ulysses Phoenix  and  Ajax  Observe their different Characters their different Modes of Behaviour the different Impressions their Speeches made on  Achilles  and the different Treatment he gave them Again observe the different Demeanour of the Grecian Heroes  on that melancholy Night when as the Poet expresses it  Hector  's Approach in ev'ry Wind they hear  And  Hector  's Fury ev'ry Moment fear  All this is worthy to be remarked with the utmost Care It is admirably fine and proves to what a great Degree  Homer  has kept up to what the Critics call MORES the MANNERS  I am my dearest yours J P  By way of Postscript to my Letter of this Day I shall add a few Lines  You see through the whole  Iliad  that the Gods always refused the Prayers and Supplications of wicked Men especially those who continued in their wicked Courses I need not quote Ex+amples We see the same verified in many Passages of the Scripture and it is confirmed by no less an Author than  Our Saviour  Not every one that faith unto me Lord Lord but he that doeth the Will of my Father that is in Heaven  The great Moral of the  Iliad  was confirmed by the sad Experience of Aftertimes and one would almost think that  Homer  had foreseen for  Philip  of  Macedon  as well as the Kings of  Syria  and  Persia  The Romans after taking Advantage of the Dissensions that arose among the Greeks or of those they sowed among them themselves fell a Prey to other Nations at last and this will certainly happen to be the Case of the  United Provinces  one Time or other unless they continue to be more wise and virtuous than any States ever were united in the same Manner as they  are  Now my dear I should be glad you would let me know what you next wish to converse about in this Manner As I read  Homer  through I shall hint to you such particular Beauties as I occasionally meet  You do not tell me whether or no you have the little Essay on Epic Poetry before your  Telemaque  Be sure to write me what you like best in the  Odyssey  as you read it but don't confine yourself to that and read it only when you please To relish what we read and profit by it we should sit down to it with an Inclination  Adieu ma très chere Nannette et soyez persuadée que je vous aime tant que j'aime mes yeux  J P  LETTER XLIX  Oxon  Feb    My dear Nancy  I DARE say you are beginning to be weary of  Homer  as well as you love him and of the many Observations we have made therefore we will drop him after this and my next Letterat least for some Time and find another Subject for our epistolary Conversation  In the mean Time please to observe that when  Achilles  was reconciled to  Agamemnon  it was not either that his Anger was abated or that the Love of his Country or his Countrymen got the better  of it but another Piece of Resentment and Desire of Revenge got the better of the former as it was incompatible with the other And this new Resentment of his was still more furious than the first and much more unreasonable for certainly  Hector  was in the right to kill  Patroclus  and though  Achilles  might lament the Death of his Friend yet there was no Reason for his exercising such a brutal Passion against a fair Enemy  You will find this very agreeable to the Accounts we have in the Holy Scriptures of the Dispensations of God who makes every thing even the Sins and Follies of People contribute to advance and bring about the Completion of his  sacred Purposes and Will It still serves too to illustrate his  grande Morale  which he never loses Sight of    The Jews when they cried out against our Saviour  Crucify him crucify him  little dreamed that they were forwarding the Salvation of Mankind nor had  Judas  any such Design when he betrayed him neither did the High Priest know the grand Import of his own Words when he said  It was expedient for one Man to die for the People  Thus Providence punished the Greeks by the Fierceness of  Achilles  and by that very Fierceness saved them when reconciled to them Many are the Instances  of this Kind in the sacred Writings  David  says  The Wrath of Man shall turn to thy Praise and the Residue thereof thou shalt restrain  Another Thing very well worth observing and which is still a great Proof and Illustration of the Truth of the above Moral is this  Homer  never brings any great Event to bear any fortunate Act to be performed or noble Virtue exercised without the Assistance of a divine Power When his Heroes fail it is because the  Gods  have forsaken them Do they succeed It is because the  Gods  are with them Do they act prudently The  Gods  inspire them Do they act foolishly  The  Gods  blind them But then it is as observable that this is the Result of their own Conduct and Principles There is a Something in their Minds which renders them either dear or detestable to the Deities This is agreeable to the whole Tenour of the Old Testament as you may read in an hundred Instances of the Kings of  Israel Juda Syria  c c  Lastly you see the Means of acquiring the Favour of the Supreme was next to a virtuous Life bespeaking him by Prayer This is the Practice of all  Homer  's great Men and the Success of their Undertakings was always accompanied with Sacrifices of Praise and Thanksgiving This was understood to  be an indispensable Return of Duty and Gratitude to the Gods When  Hector  escapes safe from  Diomede  the latter cries out  Once more thank  Phoebus  for thy forfeit Breath  Well by  Apollo  are thy Pray'rs repaid  And  Jupiter  says in more Places than one when speaking in  Hector  's Favour  That he had offered many Sacrifices to the Deities  Thus as these Heroes imputed the Escape of their Enemies to some God so when they expressed their Hopes of getting the better of them they are frequently accustomed to say  If such or such a God assist me  Herein they conformed to the Phrase in Scripture  They did not put their Trust in their  own Swords or Bows  Virgil  has given us an Instance of an Hero 'tis true who did put his Trust in his own Strength I mean  Mezentius  My own right Hand says he is my God and the Dart I am going to throw  But  Virgil  took Care beforehand to represent him a most impious Wretch and a Tyrant and makes his End suitable to his bad Character  Now my dear fearing I have sufficiently tired you I will add no more but that I am  your faithful and most affectionate Friend J P  LETTER L  Oxon  Feb    THIS subsequent Letter may more properly be stiled a Postscript to to the foregoing wherein I forgot to observe to you that when the Purpose of Heaven was fulfilled by the Resentment of  Achilles  against  Hector  the former was checked in his Career before the half of his Resentment was satisfied He had doomed the Body of  Hector  to be without Burial and funeral Honours to be left a Prey to Dogs and Vultures but  Jove  and the other Gods would not permit that  Hector  was dear to them on Account of his Piety  Jove  would  have him buried honourably and  Achilles  was obliged to let go his Hold Herein the Residue of his Wrath was restrained Heaven having no further Use for it and herein also is verified another Passage in Scripture  Precious in the Sight of the Lord is the Death of his Saints  Ps  cxvi  Ver    I am  my dear Nancy  ever yours J P  LETTER LI  Oxon  Feb    My dear  I SAID in a former Letter that I had done with  Homer  but I find I have not  In order to make his Morals or the Application of his Doctrine relish better he has beautifully diversified his Story He has introduced many Episodes that are very delightful for Example that which  Glaucus  tells to  Diomede  that which  Phoenix  tells to  Achilles  that which  Nestor  relates and many others Observe too they are always told in a  proper Place and always recommend some Virtue or arraign some Vice  Many of his Episodes and other Stories have also the same Tendency with the great Design that is to say to shew the ill Effects of Division Resentment and obstinate Revenge particularly that of  Phoenix  to  Achilles  or to shew us that inordinate Lusts Affections or Appetites lead to Sin and Misery or to illustrate the  grande Morale  That God's Will must be accomplished and his Counsel must stand  And by continually mixing these Stories in his Work he calls up our Attention to the great Purpose of it  Besides this great Purpose he gives us occasional Precepts Instances of what  is fit decent prudent and of their Contraries He sets before our Eyes many beautiful and useful Things in Nature as of the Heavens the Earth rural Labours Winter Summer Harvest Rocks Mountains Rivers Seas  c  as likewise of artificial Things namely of War Peace Commerce  c  But I refer you to what Mr  Pope  has said hereon  The last Thing that I shall desire you to observe is this Though the main Design of the  Iliad  is to shew us that Misery flows from Sin and Sin from unbridled Appetites yet he therein presents us with many Instances of Happiness and Success flowing from doing our Duty and contrarywise in the  Odyssey  though the main Tendency of that Poem be to shew that Happiness slows from a Discharge of our Duty to God and Man which is the Consequence of subduing our Passions yet he mixes in the Course of his Story frequent Instances of Misery arising out of Sin  To concludeI fancy to myself that I see  Homer  like a most renowned old Philosopher or one of the ancient Prophets preaching to his Countrymen in this Manner"Learn O my Countrymen that all Unhappiness proceeds from Sin and Sin proceeds from inordinate Affections Learn that all Happiness proceeds from Virtue and Virtue from hearkening to the Dictates of Reason that in the one Case God will assist you  in the other desert you To obtain his Assistance you must depend on him you must ascribe all to him that you do well you must apply to him by servent Prayer and not that alone but you must leave Vice and embrace Virtue otherwise God will not hearken to you though you make many Prayers and when he blesses and assists you you must render him the Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving"  "To confirm the first of these my Doctrines I will tell you a Story of the Wrath of  Achilles  and the Quarrel that happened between him and  Agamemnon  supreme Leader of the Grecians at the Siege of Troy which besides confirming my first Doctrine will plainly prove  that Divisions and Dissensions among People united in a common Cause and Interest though they may consist of many little independent States and Sovereignties must probably be the Ruin of them all This may be the Case of Greece and you may be swallowed up by some great Prince or other if Divisions be raised and encouraged among you"  "To prove my second Doctrine to wit that bridling your Passions acting with Patience Prudence and Piety and consequently having God to favour you will lead you to Success through the greatest Difficulties I will tell you a Story of the Travels of  Ulysses  And from both you may derive this important Truth namely that every thing whatsoever is ordered  disposed governed conducted and established by the allwise allpowerful and immutablycertain Will of God and must be brought to the Period that he has set and determined"  If you have  Creech's Horace  at Hand read the second Epistle of his first Book of Epistles It is inscribed to  Lollius  You will see there in what View he considers these two Poems  Adieu  J P  LETTER LII  Oxon  Feb    My dear Nancy  I AM highly gratified in seeing you take so much Delight in the  Iliad  particularly in the moral Doctrine inculcated throughout that excellent Poem  By the Earnestness wherewith you desire me still to continue my Remarks it should seem as if you conceived there were no other Author fit to be the Subject of our epistolary Correspondence There are many more Some you have ever at Hand If you would now and then read the Proverbs of  Solomon Ecclesiastes  the Wisdom of  Solomon  and of  Jesus  the Son of  Sirach  with the Archbishop of  Cambray  's Dialogues Fables and Lives of the Philosophers they could not miss to furnish you with Abundance of Reflections equally proper for Writing and Conversation and this they would do without its being necessary that you should comment on every Passage you read there or write down every Reflection that presents itself only such  as most strongly and naturally affect you  I am pleased with your Observations on many of  Homer  's Beauties I have gone through the Author as I have examined them These added to those of Mr  Pope  who has been so copiously excellent leave very little for me to say but I will oblige you wherever I can Nothing has occurred to me till now with the th Book open before me It would be endless to point out every Passage I think excellent I shall only confine myself to such as I fancy will admit some particular Remark or Illustration  The Complaint against  Jove  at Line is what Mankind in general is too  guilty of We lay to the Charge of God what is our own Fault  Jeremiah  seems to have been exactly in this Predicament when he says "Why art thou to me as a Lyar  c"  At Verse  Diomede  says to  Agamemnon  Thou first and thou alone in Fields of Fight  Durst brand my Courage and defame my Might  He recollects the Reproach cast on him in a former Book though at that Time he made no Reply to it Hence we learn  to take Care what we say  for though we may fancy an Expression forgot it may return and be of bad Consequence when we least expect it  Verse  Nestor  says  Now pray to Jove to grant what Greece demands  Pray in deep Silence and with purest Hands  This is agreeable to what our Saviour recommends "When thou prayest enter into thy Closet  c"  and  David  says "I will wash my Hands in Innocency and so will I compass thine Altars O Lord"  In the Beginning of Book the tenth observe with how much Propriety  Agamemnon  is employed then  Menelaus Diomede Nestor  and  Ulysses  The Wisdom of  Diomede  in chusing  Ulysses  for his Companion together with the whole Transaction of that Night point out  the great Use of taking Advice and Assistance in an arduous Enterprize  Adieu  J P  LETTER LIII  Oxon  Feb    NEptune's Progress to assist the Greeks in Book the Thirteenth is admirably described and Mr  Pope  has shewn us the Affinity between that and a Passage in the sixtyeighth Psalm but there are many other Places in the holy Writings wherewith it may be compared It would be endless to enumerate them they will occur to you in your Perusal of that sacred Volume which is absurdly given as a TaskBook  to Children indiscriminately of all Capacities when it is an Exercise for the most adult and experienced Understanding  What Mr Preston says here is surely no Contradiction to his having recommended the  Bible  to his Pupil though so early as at Years of Age Be it observed that by his excellent Instructions she had then read other Authors and was more than capable of digesting what he proposed namely the  Proverbs Ecclesiasticus  c He only objected to the absurd Custom practised then as at this Day of suffering Children  to learn to read  from the Bible whence they too often contract a Distaste to the most edifying and important Volume that can in the Process of their Lives be laid before them    If I may be excused for saying it I think there are some few Faults in Mr  Pope  's Translation and Notes in these two Books In Book xiii Verse  His troops unpractis'd in the Fights of Stand  is surely a strange Expression  Mr  Pope  's Note on  Hector  's Reproach to  Paris  Verse  Illfated Paris Slave to Womankind c  is not accompanied with his usual Judgment  Hector  indeed is bold and impatientso far he may resemble  Achilles  but he is neither violent nor unjust Though he was impetuous yet we see through the whole Book that he was manageable  Achilles  never was and had not  Hector  Cause during the Course of the War to be highly offended at  Paris  Book xiv Verse  Great Jove awaking shook the blest Abides  With rising Wrath and tumbled Gods on Gods  The latter Part of this Translation I could wish not quite so  low  though it is pretty near the Original which actually  signifies  throwing the Gods about  c It reminds me of an Expression in  Lee's Oedipus  Gods meet Gods and jostle in the dark  I shall write you again on Friday Je suis avec mes Complements ou ils sont dues le votre  J P  LETTER LIV  Oxon  Feb    My Dear  I HAVE now reperused the th and th Books of the  Iliad  Your own Observations on these are remarkably good therefore I have very little to say  In Verse Book xv the Swiftness of a God Compared to that of the Thought of Man is inimitably beautiful Mr  Pope  has justly remarked it but a much inferior Genius could not have overlooked it  In Verse we find  Nestor  placing the Confidence of his Prayer in his Piety towards the Gods which confirms one of  Homer  's great moral Rules and which I have touched upon in a former Letter  Book xvi Verse This Simile is extremely striking Literally rendered from the Greek it would run thus  No Child that runs after its Mother and holds her fast by the Robe and hinders her from proceeding and looks up in her Face weeping to make her take it in her Arms  c  You cannot imagine how beautiful it is in the Original  In Verse  Homer  now makes the same Implication in the Person of  Patroclus  that he did formerly in the Person of  Phoenix  namely the Obstinacy of  Achilles  and the ill Consequences thereof This is an Epitome of the whole Scope of the Poem which as Mr  Pope  remarks  Homer  every now and then introduces to fix our Attention to his great Design  In my preceding Letter I endeavoured to distinguish the Disposition of  Hector  from that of  Achilles  In Verse we have a strong Instance of the savage Temper of the latter How unlike the pious  Hector  Verse This Description of  Patroclus  besides being admirably beautiful conveys an excellent Moral  I have just received yours but have not yet had Time to read it all Adieu jusqu'á Dimanche  I am your affectionate J P  LETTER LV  Oxon  Feb    My dear Nancy  SINCE I wrote you last which was on Friday I have perused two Books more of the  Iliad  accompanied with your Observations  The Conflict at Verse Book xvii about the Body of  Patroclus  is wonderfully fine How naturally is it compared to Fires that rise and sink by Turns  Homer  seems fond of the Image himself for he repeats it in Book xviii Indeed the whole Struggle from the Time  Patroclus  was killed till  Achilles  appeared is most admirably described  Book xviii Verse  Pensive he sate for all that Fate design'd  Rose in sad Prospect to his boding Mind  This Picture of  Achilles  is most affectingly fine But here I will presume to say we may prove Mr  Pope  to have been wrong in his Remark on a former Book where he avers "It was Jealousy of his  Honour that made  Achilles  lay his Commands on  Patroclus  not to fight with  Hector  " We see here that he immediately imagines him to have been slain whence it appears more probable that his warning him to shun  Hector  's Force was from Apprehension of the Consequences not Jealousy of the Motive  Verse Here are four admirable Lines The Description of the Shield is admirable throughout What Mr  Pope  himself has said about it and what he has quoted from others will in great Measure give you a true Taste of Sculpture and Painting and deserves to be read often  I am  my dear Nancy  yours truly J P  LETTER LVI  Oxon  Feb    My Dear  I HAVE now gone through another Book of  Homer  and made the following Remarks  Book xix Verse  Achilles  confirms the Observation I formerly made namely that it was not the Love of his Country but a new Resentment that incited him and though he preaches here against Resentment and obstinate Fury yet it is obstinate Fury which here possesses him and actually makes him preach against it  Verse  Agamemnon  in his Speech confirms your Observation laying the Blame of his Folly on Fate and the Gods and thinks thereby to clear himself of the Imputation I think the Story he tells here though to the Purpose might have been spared Mr  Pope  observes very justly that  Homer  always regards due Decorum He makes  Achilles  rise but  Agamemnon  sit still  Verfe Here  Achilles  imputes the Blame of his own Folly to  Jove  as  Agamemnon  did before and herein as in other Instances it may be said that  Homer  means to remind us of the great Tendency of his Poem for he tells us it was the high Will of  Jove  that doomed their Strife and doomed the Greeks to fall  Book xx Verse I think what  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  has said in this Note is very reasonable and as strong as any thing Mr  Pope  has said against it How the Fact really was is hard to know at this Distance of Time  I shalt finish what I have to say on the  Iliad  in two more Letters I believe and hope to conclude this Week  I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  LETTER LVII  Oxon  March    AT the Beginning of Book the Twentyfirst the Description of the Flood endeavouring to drown  Achilles  is the Produce of a vast Imagination The Comparison at Verse is admirable as is also the Conflagration and the Effect it had on the Fishes  But with Submission I think all the Scuffle between  Juno  and  Diana  Verse very ridiculous  Verfe This Comparison and the Note upon it proves what I have often  observed a Conformity between  Homer  and our Holy Scripture  Book xxii Verse A further Confirmation how dear are pious Men to God  Verse Read the Notes here Methinks Mr  Pope  or  Eustathius  overacts the Defence of  Homer  in this Place  The Note here entirely belongs to  Eustathius Pope  is not actually only negatively involved in it merely by not having contradicted what was asserted by the other  They explain the supernatural Assistances which  Achilles  receives into Allegory yet affirm the like when shewn to  Hector  to be real merely to favour or rather to aggrandize the Valour of  Ajax  and  Achilles  Verse Here is surely one of the most beautiful Passages in the whole  Iliad  and what  Andromache  observes and complains of we find verified to this Day It ever has and will be so  The Lamentations of  Priam Hecuba  and  Andromache  in this Book and those of  Hecuba Helen  and  Andromache  in the last are all different they arise from different Motives and each Person utters what immediately belongs to his or her Character and Circumstances a further Proof how judiciously  Homer  has preserved the  Manners  throughout his Poem It is again evinced in Book xxiii Verse The Behaviour of  Achilles  in this Place how very consistent The Appearance of the Ghost of  Patroclus  and all that passes is extremely fine  In the Detail of Prizes given to the Racers at the funeral Games observe the following Lines  A Woman for the first in Beauty's Bloom  Skill'd in the Needle and the lab'ring Loom  Do they not imply with many other Passages in this Poem that Women how beautiful soever are not prized without some useful and laudable Qualification  Verse Here we have a beautiful Picture of an old Man instructing his Son how to win the Prize and we also discern with what an extensive Genius  Homer  was blessed for the Rules that  Nestor  gave being universally useful are as much in Force now as they were then  The Observation on Line by Madame  Dacier  and  Pope  's subjoined Sneer are in my Opinion equally nonsensical  The Note on Verse beginning at these Words  But also his Design might be to compliment the Greeks  c  is by no Means just and even contradicts what the Author has often said of  Ajax  To return to the very first Note on this Book I cannot concur with Mr  Pope  's Opinion in Defence of  Homer  's Conduct in carrying on his Work for two Books after the Death of  Hector  He urges that  Homer  's Undertaking was to describe the Anger of  Achilles  and as that  Anger did not die with  Hector  but persecuted even his Remains so the Poet still keeps up to his Subject But Mr  Pope  with Deference I speak it is mistaken it is not simply the Anger of  Achilles  that is  Homer  's Subject but that particular Anger and Resentment which was so destructive to  Greece  and took Birth from his Dissension with  Agamemnon  This Subject after the Death of  Hector  is entirely exhausted and the Revenge then pursued is of a different Nature from the  Wrath  which  Homer  undertook to sing for instead of being destructive it then becomes advantageous to the Greeks  In my next I shall give you my Opinion of the Reasons which induced the  Author to protract his Work beyond the Death of  Hector  I thought to have done it here and so have finished this Subject of our Letters but the Assizes are now held in this City Some Gentlemen from London engage my Time and an Acount I have just received of the Duke of  Hamilton  's Death unnerves my Spirits  Your last is come to Hand the Matter and Handwriting please me infinitely  Adieu my dearest I will write again on Sunday  Yours truly J P  LETTER LVIII  Oxford  March    Dear Nancy  I HAVE now read the  Iliad  to an End and have but few Remarks to make on the two last Books  Book xxiii Verse  The huge Ox bellowing falls with feebler Cries  Expires the Goat the Sheep in Silence dies  These two Lines are a just Picture of the Nature of the respective Animals How characteristically affecting is the last to a tender Mind  Ver Here are eight fine Lines and they shew us what was the Creed at that  Time The last I think much exceeds the Original  These two Notes escaped me when I wrote last as many other Things do and indeed Mr  Pope  's Excellence in Criticism has left very little in the Power of any succeeding Commentator I seldom repeat to you what he has said unless I think it so remarkable as to deserve your peculiar Attention  I now proceed to the twentyfourth Book and shall consequently very soon put an End to this Subject which has entertained us so long  Verse This Description of  Achilles  's Lamentation is admirable though the  Lines and are not in my Judgment so full and so expressive as in the Original which is as follows if literally rendered  Sometimes he lay on his Side sometimes he turned quickly on his Back then he lay prone on his Face and then he stood strait up on his Feet  Verse This is an exceeding natural Picture of a Person particularly one in Years overwhelmed with Grief Mr  Pope  's Note is most judicious and well worthy Attention There is nothing more common than for a Parent in the first Transports of Affliction to prefer a Child that is dead to all who remain alive  I have done now with particular Remarks and though we have dwelt on this Subject so long I yet feel a Desire to communicate my general Sentiments I mean my Opinion of  Homer  's continuing his Poem beyond the Reconciliation of  Achilles  with  Agamemnon  Perhaps I may not express myself so well as to be understood or my Arguments may appear too subtle not solid enough Be that as it may I shall expect an impartial Account of your Sense of them and what your Sentiments really and unreservedly are on the same Point  But this in my next and then adieu  Homer  I am  my dear Angel  your faithful Friend J P  LETTER LIX  Oxon  March    My dear Nancy  IN these my general Sentiments on our great Bard I must be very frank and the rather to induce you to be so in your Answer I profess myself of a different Opinion from Mr  Pope  concerning the Reasons which induced  Homer  to carry on his Work beyond the Death of  Hector  I am apt to think the true Reason was that the Poet had many more beautiful Things to say which he was unwilling should be lost and truly I am glad they were not But then the Question is whether he has done  judiciously in protracting the Work rather than to close it with the Death of  Hector  as  Virgil  has finished the  Aeneid  with that of  Turnus  To form a right Judgment hereon we should consider the Subjects of the respective Poems that is what those two great Poets proposed by them  The Subject of the  Aeneid  is the Atchievements as well as Sufferings of  Aeneas  till he brought about a Settlement in a new Kingdom for himself his Family and the People in  Italy  To the Accomplishment of all this there was no Obstruction but the Rivalship of  Turnus  consequently on his Death all  is compleated There was no need to carry the Work further though one  Masshoeus  has added a thirteenth Book wherein  Aeneas  is married to  Lavinia  But this is superfluous The great Obstacle being removed the Poet leaves us to imagine all the rest What he had proposed was entirely fulfilled to wit all the Sufferings his Hero had to undergo with Seas and Winds with Men and Gods and all the cross Accidents he had to wrestle with and bravely subdue by his Patience or Exploits But it is not so in the  Iliad  The Poet there proposes to sing the fatal  Consequences  of the Resentment of  Achilles  It was therefore very justifiable in him to carry on his Work beyond the Time that Resentment lasted If it ought to have ended  with that there was no Need to make him kill  Hector  for that Event fell without the Period of his Resentment to  Agamemnon  which is the Groundwork of his Poem But the Poet certainly designed to shew not only the sad Disasters that befel the  Greeks  through the Resentment of  Achilles  but to give still a stronger Impression of the bad Effects of Dissension among Chiefs as well as other Persons whose Interests are united He paints the great Change of the Grecian Affairs for the better on his Reconciliation with the Leader of the  Greeks  The Ships are saved  Hector  is killed the Trojans are repulsed and driven within their Town What follows namely the dragging the Coarse of  Hector  round  Troy  the Grief and Behaviour of  Achilles  on  the Loss of  Patroclus  the Institution of the  Games  at his Funeral all this is in order to compleat the Character of his Hero to shew us his Virtues as well as his Vices He makes him an extraordinary Person both Ways and yet of vast nay of absolute Importance to the successful Issue of the War He has probably given him this mixed Character as a Lesson how Princes and Rulers ought to manage Persons of great Importance who have strong Qualities both good and bad so that they may turn the former to their Advantage and by a cautionary Prudence divert any bad Effects from the latter  To point out the Importance of  Achilles  still stronger it was necessary to set  forth that of  Hector  Though this is done throughout the whole Work while  Hector  lived it is not sufficient The Poet does not stop there The Circumstances of his Death the Lamentations of his Father Mother Wife Sister  Helen  and the whole People the Behaviour of the  Grecians  and indeed  Achilles  's own Speech after he had killed him render him still more important than all that had been said or described of him before  Add hereunto the Approbation in which he was held by  Jupiter Apollo Mercury  and almost all the Gods their Resentment at  Achilles  on his Account their compelling the Body to be delivered up to honourable Burial and  Achilles  himself lifting it on the Bier  I am apt to think that Piety which  Homer  has all along recommended was the great Lesson he proposed to inculcate by this last Book The Praises of  Hector  for his Piety occur so thick and the Concern of the Gods for his Death is so strongly painted that one would be tempted to believe  Hector  was as much his Hero as  Achilles  only of another Kind and though the Poet condemns the Cause he was concerned in and makes him suffer for it yet he seems to be more in Love with him than with his professed Hero He does ample Justice to his Virtues and seems to make him much rather than  Achilles  a Pattern for Imitation  Remember you are to send me your free Opinion on all I have said I don't desire you to write very long Letters Write two or three short ones at different Times and then put them all under one Cover  I am  my dear Nancy  yours J P  LETTER LX  Oxon  March    Dear Nancy  I Received your Favour of the th but have not yet laid in Provision for a Letter on the  Odyssey  I have at last  read the two Plays you desired me  Sir Fopling Flutter  and  Sir Courtly Nice  The Man of Mode  or  Sir Fopling Flutter  was first written The Author was a highbred Gentleman his Characters are well drawn the Dialogue is easy natural and genteel there is a great deal of Wit and good Sense in the Conversation among the principal Characters especially between  Dorimant  and  Loveit  and between the same Gentleman and  Harriet Old Bellair  is very entertaining he is goodnatured pleasant open and sincere in a Word he is a downright Country Gentleman of the best Sort  If I mistake not the  Spectator  long ago censured this Play as being built  on a wrong Foundation for says he "the End of it is to promote Vice"  Dorimant  his fine Gentleman is a Wit well bred of excellent Sense and extremely engaging but totally devoid of Faith and Honour  Harriet  the fine Lady is perpetually despising her Mother The Scene of the OrangeWoman and drunken Shoemaker is too gross and ought not to have been brought into such polite Company A Lady of good Quality and a fine young Heiress lodging in an OrangeWoman's House is I think wrong judged and  Dorimant  affirming his Intention of marrying  Harriet  was to repair his Fortune is in my Opinion out of Character unless that as a Rake he thought Shame to own that he was really in Love but  surely even that is driving the Rake too far for  Dorimant  The  Spectator  after having remarked some Passages in this Comedy adds  This whole celebrated Piece is a perfect Contradiction to good Manners good Sense and common Honesty Nothing but being lost to a Sense of Innocence and Virtue can make any one see it without observing more frequent Occasion to move Sorrow and Indignation than Mirth and Laughter  He had great Reason indeed for what he said The Sufferance of such immoral Pieces perverts the true Intent of the Stage which was meant to be a Place of instructive Amusement not empty Dissipation That Mr  Addison  considered it in this Light is evident from the two Pieces he gave to the Theatre  Cato  and the  Drummer  The Growth of licentious Pieces is principally if not altogether to be ascribed to the vitiated Taste of an Audience The vulgar Expression  If there were no Receivers there would be no Knaves  may be here not unaptly alluded to  If there were no Encouragers of immoral Pieces none such would be represented  It cannot be doubted but the Regulator of a Theatre would rather desire to see it a Seat of Decorum than of Licentiousness or that an Actor would be better pleased to utter Sentiments of Truth and Virtue than those of Vice and Immorality  The other Play  Sir Courtly Nice  seems to be an Imitation of  The Man of Mode  though a faint one Notwithstanding there are some good Things in the former yet the Characters are not by far so genteel nor is there so much Wit or good Sense in the Dialogue as in the latter  Farewel  is a sort of  Dorimant  only not vicious  The Aunt  is a Copy of  Lady Woodvill  and  Leonora  of  Harriet  The Contrast between  Hothead  and  Testimony  is diverting but I cannot think they are naturally brought in  Sir Courtly Nice  is well drawn but not so delightful a Fop as  Sir Fopling  nor do I think his Foppery savours so much of the "Gentleman" I do not know what to make of  Lord Belguard  I think him in the main a silly Fellow though perhaps  with some Smattering of good Sense and Breeding  Hothead  's Behaviour to him is quite  outrée Crack  's Character appears overdone and the unravelling of the Plot not entirely natural  Surly  altogether is too gross though some Part of what he he says is entertaining enough There are certainly many worse Plays The Purpose and Tendency of this Piece being rather good than otherwise gives it in my Opinion one material Ascendancy over  The Man of Mode  Perhaps what I have said may engage you to read them over again and then I shall be glad to have your Opinion of them  I am  my dear  your sincere Friend J P  LETTER LXI  Oxon  March    My dear Angel  I Received a Letter from you just as I had finished my last and since that I have received yours of the th instant  I am exceedingly pleased with your Observations on the  Odyssey  I only regret that you have not made more and have gone so quickly through it In a late Letter I reminded you of some Books which I had mentioned formerly such as the Bible and Apochrypha  Rochefaucault  c where you might find very good Subjects for our Conversation  I have begun to read the  Odyssey  but shall only at this Time take notice of the Observation you make on the Answer  Telemachus  gives to  Mentes  about the Doubtfulness of his Legitimacy  Pope  says  Whatever Truth there may be in the Reply there is very little Decency in it  I must own myself of a different Opinion I think  Telemachus  rather means a Compliment than a Reflection on his Mother The Meaning of the Author in my Conception amounts to this  The Certainty of our Legitimacy depends on the Word and Honesty of our Mothers Penelope avows me to be her Son by Ulysses and considering the virtuous Character of my Mother there is no Doubt to be made of my being so her Avowal of it amounts to absolute Proof  Prefixed to the  Odyssey  is an Abstract from  Bossu  on Epic Poetry which if I had read it before I wrote my Letters on the  Iliad  would ha  saved me a great deal of what I wrote as it will many Things which otherwise I might write on the  Odyssey  It is a most excellent Piece and I would have you read it over and over again  I remember when I was very young the fourteenth Book of the  Odyssey  pleased me peculiarly and I then minuted down my Observations upon it If I recollect right it is the Conversation between  Ulysses  or  Telemachus  and  Eumoeus  I have not the Volume at Hand just now  I am mightily pleased with your last Letter it is written clean and carefully the Style is good and the Observations just and judicious I hope to have more such from you soon In every Letter I write I shall transmit my Remarks on two Books You have prevented me in many  Tell me particularly how your Mama does and believe me to be  my dear Nancy  yours unalterably J P  LETTER LXII  Oxon  March    IN the first Book of the  Odyssey  we find the Misfortunes that befel the Companions of  Ulysses  sprung from the very Cause whence those in the  Iliad  arose namely an Offence to the Gods they had committed an Affront to  Apollo  Their impious Folly dar'd to prey  On Herds devoted to the God of Day  B i V  The next Point wherein they resemble each other is in the Assistance of Heaven in all Difficulties being granted to the virtuous obtained by Prayer and returned by Sacrifice and Thanksgiving  The next is in the Vengeance of Heaven on wicked Men I must again recommend to you to read the Abstract from  Bossu  prefixed to the  Odyssey  You well observe that Hospitality is represented in a most beautiful Light in both Works  I think all that Mr  Pope  and the other Commentators have said in the Note on Verse does not satisfactorily account for this Voyage of  Ulysses  and we find the Suitors afterwards drawing the Occasion of a Jeer from that very Passage  Or comes from Ephyre with Poisons fraught  And kills us all in one tremendous Draught  B ii Ver  To remark some particular Passages I go back to the first Book The Advice given by  Mentes  to  Telemachus  Verse deserves your closest Attention The prudent Caution at Verse  If yet Ulysses views the Light c  is very remarkable  Book ii Line  To climb with haughty Fires  The royal Bed c  has been much criticized and not without Reason There is something rather too free in the Expression  What a natural and affecting Picture is given of the old Nurse Verse  She filled the Walls with Cries  And Tears ran trickling from her aged Eyes  The Description of  Telemachus  's Embarkment and setting sail gives a beautiful Close to this Book It is as excellent in Mr  Pope  's Translation as it is natural in the Original  J P  LETTER LXIII  Oxon  March    My Dear  I Have read over the third and fourth Books of the  Odyssey  The Advice which  Mentor  or rather  Pallas  in his Shape gives to  Telemachus  at the Opening of the third Book is most admirably prudent and just  Verse and are very poetical and instructive to all Degrees of Life  Verse Notwithstanding what Mr  Pope  says here about the Force of Destiny I think no other Defence can be made for  Telemachus  than his Youth and that Impatience which naturally arises from a long Endurance of Afflictions The Answer of  Pallas  which is most admirable certainly points it out  Verse What a charming Instance have we here of the Power of good Advice when delivered in a pleasing amiable Way Poetry and Music united with divine or moral Precepts conspire to keep the Mind from giving way to Temptation  Verse Besides that this is a very judicious Observation in the Poet for the Reasons which Mr  Pope  assigns in his Note it includes an excellent moral Precept to Mankind  Verse to What an admirable Picture is given us of  Nestor  and his Family  Book iv Verse I cannot but think it somewhat indecent in  Telemachus  to stile his Father  the Man  but perhaps this is the Fault of the Translator I have not the Original by me at present to determine it  The Stanza at Line is an Instance of what I have often remarked  to be one great Point through the whole Work and at Verse we see it again  Book v I agree with you that nothing can be more beautiful than the Grotto of  Calypso  and the Environs but Verse I think is a little obscure the frequent Repetition of the Word  HE  without a Distinction seems to make it so It runs  Go then he may he must if HE ordain  would it not have been better thus  Go then he may he must if JOVE ordain  Perhaps you will say I am cavilling at Words but I  feel  the Objection strongly I think too that calling  Ulysses the Man  Verse is not so well  would not  the Prince  or  the Chief  have done better  Ver    Ulysses rob'd him in the Cloack and Vest  appears to me not particular enough There is something too inconsequential for the Hero  Verse Notwithstanding all that Mr  Pope  has said in Defence of  Ulysses  being able to compleat his Boat in four Days Time from the Description of it I think it is hardly probable  The Critics have been very severe on these Words "the wellfought Wall" Verse  You see my Observations on this Book are rather employed in finding Faults than discovering Excellencies and I really think Mr  Pope  has made more Escapes herein than in any I have read yet  The Note upon Verse is very fine and merits particular Notice  Book VI is charming throughout It gives us a delightful Picture of the Goodnature Hospitality paternal Affection and Simplicity of the Manners of the Antients Verse and perfectly agree wich the holy Psalmist where He says "Whoso giveth to the Poor lendeth to the Lord" Pray return to Verse and read the Note  on that Line and the subsequent Note and consider them carefully The Manner of  washing  observed in the Former is usual at this Day in many Places of Scotland especially when they wash what they call great Linen as Sheets TableCloths c  I thought my Dear I should have been able to get through a Book or Two more for I find what is in the Notes and what you have observed will cut my Work very short but your Letter is just come to Hand which I have read with vast Pleasure only I think you go too fast through  Rochefacault  I hope to have another from you soon on that Subject  Je vous envoyeray Vendredi par la Carosse de Monsieur  Bew  une petite
