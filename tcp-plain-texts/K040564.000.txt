 A LICK at a LIAR OR Calumny Detected  BEING An Occasional Letter TO A FRIEND FROM  Theophilus Cibber  Comedian  'Tis  SLANDER  Whose Edge is sharper than the Sword whose Tongue  Outvenoms all the Worms of  Nile  whose Breath  Rides on the Posting Winds and doth  belye  All Corners of the World Kings Queens and States  Maids Matrons Nay the Secrets of the Grave  This viperous  Slander  enters  Shakespear  's Cymbeline  Sine meIbis in Urbem  Hei mihi quod  Domino non licet ire tuo  OVID  LONDON  Printed for R GRIFFITES in  St Paul's ChurchYard  Price Sixpence  THE PREFACE  OF how small Concern soever the Writer of the following Letter may be to the Public yet as their kind Opinion is of the utmost Importance to him and as some scandalous Aspersions and malicious Representations of him are herein confuted or set in a right Light His Name being prefixed to it may possibly raise Curiosity enough to occasion its being readThese  Reasons 'tis suggested will prove a sufficient Apology for publishing what was first intended only for the private Perusal of a few particular Friends  A LETTER c  I GUESS Business has prevented your calling on me for some time past as I know you do not want good Nature besides I am certain you had me in your Mind having been informed you were kind enough to speak in my behalf when my Character was attacked by a  low Fellow  who  unworthily  bears the  Name  of a  Comedian  because during a Dearth of decent Performers he is suffered unnoticed to murder many a Part to the Reproach of our present sterile Stage while he modestly misconstrues the  Forbearance  of the  Town  into an  Approbation  This Slanderer whose Soul is darker than his dusky Countenance which often dingily degrades a genteel Comedy by his disgraceful Appearance has as I am well informed been very busy in propagating some Falshoods to my Prejudice at this most unpardonable Juncture when I can't come Abroad to give him an Answer if he were worthy one  If his Mind had the least Tincture of a  Gentleman  a Name which indeed neither his Birth Education or Morals give him the least Pretensions to he would know that now to utter even a severe Truth were an Act of Inhumanity and that to indulge Spleen against the Unfortunate is as base as cowardly striking the Prostate What he may be pleased to say of me as an Actor is delightfully despicable I have too proper a Contempt for his MockJudgment not to consider his Disapprobation as a Compliment and must imagine any one of True Taste would regard his Praise as the severest Satire  Were I disposed to throw away my Time in Drawing this Notorious Man at full Length and Paint him in his  proper Colours which I may possibly be provoked to if he does not learn to restrain his Fibbing Tongue I could exhibit to View a Monster which every one but his scurvy self would start at I should have held him quite beneath my Notice as is all he utters but that the Appetite of Slander in many is too predominant and 'tis possible when the filthiest Fellow throws a Profusion of Dirt some may chance to stick if not timely thrown off I shall endeavour therefore to wipe away the sooty Smears of this Chimneysweeper by relating a simple Fact which will I flatter myself amply confute the malicious Tales of this unprovoked rancorous MortalI say unprovoked for I am not conscious I was ever guilty of an Injury towards him in Thought Word or Deed and as this Viperous Gnatho has ever to my Face affected to be my Friend his Backbiting appears the more surprisingly injurious and shocking Why this bad Man has thus endeavoured to blacken me I should not readily have been able to account for had not the entertaining  Inspector  furnished me with the following Paragraph in his Essay on Detraction  c  One would imagine by the Spirit and eager Pleasure with which Calumnies are raised and propagated that Men supposed they obtained into their own Possession all those good Qualities of the Credit of which they robbed another With those who are warmest in the Practice something like this is perhaps the Case Virtue they place in no Esteem farther than as an Article of Reputation and in this they see it only as owing its Lustre to Comparison They feel a thousand Obstacles to raising themselves up to the Level of those whom they envy but they see the same End is to be answered by bringing them down to theirs If they cannot add to the Merchandise in one Scale they will steal away the Weights from the other and the Balance will this Way also appear equal  Let me add a Line or two more from that Writer which seem  apropos  He who is himself abandoned and has not Virtue to inspire a Resolution of reclaiming will snatch at every Opportunity of Scandal in another and  he will urge it as a Proof that all Mankind are like him only that they are Hypocrites  While I am expressing my  Contempt  and  Detestation  of this  Detractor  let me confess my Obligation to Mr MACKLIN who I understand was candid enough in my Absence to contradict on his own Knowledge some of the Slander uttered against me This he is the more praiseworthy for and the Act more particularly merits my Regard as there was not any strong Intimacy subsisting between usBe so good to make my Compliments to him and let him know  I have a grateful Sense of his Behaviour to me  There are other  Chatterers  in a CoffeeHouse I am told  "who like to VillageCurs bark when their Fellows do"  The most of these are the mere  Faggots  of a  Theatre  who just serve to fill up the  MusterRoll  of a  Company  NAMES that now and then  clutter up  a  PlayBill  with as little Significancy as ROE and DOE in a  Writ  or JOHN ANOKES and TOM ASTILES in a  Law Case  When you hear any of 'em  mentioned you no more annex the Idea of an Actor to the Names of the former than you do to the latter the Idea of any one Breathing Might not one cry out with FALSTAEF when they are seen or mentioned  I am a Rogue if I am not ashamed of my Company  These are a Kind of Parrots who fancy they entertain while their Prating is but the Pest of the Public Society yet they will be heard though they are more disturbing to a rational Conversation than the pert and noisy Chirpings of caged Birds in a small Room on a sunshiny DayAmong these may be one or two perhaps who by a lucky Hit in some farcical Extravaganza with Buffoonery and Impudence which with the Million too frequently pass for Humour and Spirit sans Judgment or Genius gain the Applause of a Day and then deem themselves Actors much as some modern Metremongers from the Success of a slight Sonnet sung with universal Applause forsooth at  SadlersWells  assume the Character of Poets  These choice Brethren of the Buskin and Sock with which our present Theatres too much abound are a sort of  Things who have no Chance for being Conspicuous but by the Removal or Abuse of Actors to whom the Encouragement and continued Approbation of the Town may have given an established Reputation their little malicious Envy is easily accounted for and their cobweb Arts presently seen through  Pour ces Petits Hommes du Jour je me mocque de ceux  But now to answer the two particular LIES this  Bad Man  has told of me  viz  That I ran away from  Ireland  in  Debt  and left my  Bail to pay a Debt  for me in  Liverpool  How I succeeded in  Dublin  as an Actor you may have heard and a Gentleman a Wellwisher of mine having published an Account of the  Irish  Theatre in a Letter from  Dublin  to a Friend in  London  printed in the  Inspector  or  London Daily Advertiser  last Summer which I send you inclosed  See the  Appendix p  to that I refer you as far as relates to Stage AffairsAs to my Conduct off the Stage I may affirm I lived reputably and decently and my Mind being more at Ease while I was there for three Years than it had been for a long time before I know of No Irregularities I gave way  to there that could either bring Shame to myself or cause my Friends to blush for me  I remained in  Dublin  a Fortnight after the Theatre was closed and my Contract with the Manager was determined I always openly declared I intended for  London  in the SummerBut some private Business calling me hither sooner than I expected I commission'd a Friend to pay any Debts I might accidentally have forgot and immediately after my Sailing an Advertisement was published and continued to that Effect for several Days in ESDAL's NEWS LETTER of which I have some in Possession to produce if requisite And now I think I may fairly aver there is No one Person there has any Demand upon me  But now to return to  Liverpool  That I was two Years since arrested at  Liverpool  is certainA Gentleman there passed his Word for my AppearanceThis he was the more inclineable to do as He knew the original Plaintiff was not the Best of Men and had Reason to believe the  Debt was honestly disputableI yielded myself to the Attorney the next DayThe Gentleman knowing how much the Benefits for I was then acting in a Company there depended on my Performance and a favoured friend of his having one comeing on continued his Security to the AttorneySome Time after I came Post to  London  in order to settle a Bill in Chancery which I was preparing to justify myself And the Opening of the Theatre in  Dublin  to which I was engaged was so near at Hand being pinched in Time I was under a Necessity of getting thither as fast as possible  In the Interim a  Responsible Friend  of  mine  gave the Gentleman at  Liverpool  a  Satisfactory Counter Security  Had Things turned out ever so Bad as who can answer for Law Proceedings the Gentleman at  Liverpool  could not suffer But the Plaintiff dying the Affair was at an EndAnd neither one nor t'other of the Securities ever did or can sustain any Damage  "Somewhat too much of this"  And now I have only to add my Request that you would make my Compliments to all good natured Friends that enquire after meAs the Way from  Westminster  hither is Now ABRIDG'D and the Road clean and pleasant I am in Hopes having given Security for the Rules to see some of 'em at my Habitation in  Falcon Court  where oh strange to tell I lodge opposite to No less a Person than my Half Name sake THEO Kg of CCA  Thus sport the Fates with all sublunar Things  And Prisoners make of Players and of Kings  When the Term comes  Diu multumque Desiderat  I may with the Convenience of a Day Rule contrive to break from this  Retirement  if properly called on and like the ROMAN CINCINNATUS from the  Plough  once more enter on a Scene of PUBLIC ACTION  Don't you smile at the extravagant Modesty of the ComparisonLaugh and welcomeYou know I was always oddHowever is it not a laudable Ambition to be seen in good Company I confess I should not be unwilling once more to tread the Stage were no other Advantage to accrue to me from it but the Satisfaction of Entertaining a Town to whom I have formerly been greatly obligedyet I can't pretend to say in my present Circumstances I should Only do it  pro Bono Publico  as our Daily Advertisers  c  have it  So modern Quacks would have it understood  They vend their Nostrums for the Public Good  No Let my Motto be PRODESSE ET DELECTAREwhich explain'd as follows shews it  belongs  to the  Actors  as well as the  Poets  When from a Candid Audience we excite  Applause and Laughter on a Crowded Night  We  have our  Profit They  have their  Delight  I shall not now trouble you with the Epistle I design'd for my LordI had the Happiness to meet him as he was going to  BHth  He did me the Honour to stop his Coach to talk with me near Half an HourYou know His condescending Affability His Good Humour and His  many  other  amiable Qualities  which  make  even His  Inferiours  Happy and  endear  Him as much to Mankind in His  private Life  as His  Great Talents  make Him  Esteem'd  and  Honour'd  in His  publick Station  You'll not wonder therefore when I tell you He said many Goodnatur'd Things to me and made me some Compliments on my Theatrical Capacity which though my Gratitude can't forget 'em it will better become me silently to Pride my self thereon than vainly to repeat 'em He confirm'd what you had informed  me That I was not unenquired after among some of the First Distinctionand from what He farther said I have Reason to flater myself whenever I play agen I shall be honour'd with a Noble AppearanceAre not  you tired  with  reading I  am of  writing  this  long Letter  Perhaps you'll say 'tis somewhat like my LifeLight Loose Negligent and unconnectedWhatever may have been my Faults or Indiscretions I can honesty say with King  Lear"I have been a Man more sinn'd against than sinful"  That I may tire you no farther"Fare thee well at once  I am  SIR  Your Sincere Obliged Friend And most Obedient c THE CIBBER  APPENDIX  A  Letter  sent last  June  from a Gentleman in  Dublin  to his Friend in  London  Referred to in the foregoing Epistle Page    Dublin  June    SIR  AS I have some Business that detains me here longer than I exexpected I shall now give you an Epistolary Account of the  Irish  Theatre which I proposed to have reserved as a Topic of Conversation  Know then I have still continued a constant PlayHunter and have found my Time not misemployed I ever thought Plays the most rational as well as the most agreeable Amusement and the Company of the Theatre Royal in  Dublin  is well worthy of Encouragement The numerous and polite Audiences they have had this Season shew the whole Town are of my Mind We have two Theatres here but they are both rented by one Person That in  Aungierstreet  has the largest and loftiest Stage but not being so conveniently situated for the Town in general is rarely used unless for Assemblies a Dramatic Opera or now and then a Play That in  SmockAlley  is chiefly for Plays It is a compleat pretty House not so large as those of  London  consequently the Decorations cannot be so magnificent but the Scenes are very decent and the Habits  c  extremely handsome  The Performances are various and regularly conducted no Person whatever being admitted behind the Scenes Mr SHERIDAN is the chief Director and merits the Encouragement of the Public for  his Abilities as an Actor particularly in the Characters of HORATIO in the  Fair Penitent  MACBETH HAMLET and CORIOLANUS They perform near twice the Number of Plays here to what they do in  London  and act near as many Nights tho' their Company is not near so large in Number Some Plays have been repeated a dozen Times in the Season to very crowded Audiences particularly the  Provoked Husband  the  Trip to the Jubilee  and the  Nonjuror  the  Relapse Sir Fopling Flutter  the  Careless Husband  the  Double Dealer  the  Distrest Mother King John Jane Shore  the  Mourning Bride  and  Henry the th  have been often acted which is greatly owing to the inimitable Performance of Mrs WOFFINGTON who charms all but chiefly the Judicious in the Characters of  Lady Townly Sir H Wildair  and  Maria  this last mentioned Part is I think one of the highest drawn Characters in Comedy and she does the excellent Author Justice nor is the Success of the  Nonjuror  a little owing to the masterly Performance of Mr CIBBER who supports the Character of Dr  Wolf  throughout with a drole Dignity a priestly Pride insinuating Cunning and affected Humility as marks the Character  with true Humour Spirit and Propriety and shews him a just Comedian These two Comedians in most of their Parts excel others but in these they may be said to excel themselvesI always esteemed him a good Actor but had not seen him act since the Beginning of when he appeared not in such perfect Health as he seems now to enjoy with a happy Flow of Spirits He has this last Winter given great Delight in the several Characters of  Lord Foppington Sir Fopling Flutter Sir Francis Wronghead Beau Clincher Polonius Scrub Sir Paul Pliant Clodio Don Manuel Barnaby Brittle Gomez Abel Drugger c  in all which he shew'd a thorough Knowledge of Life and an unconfined Genius he pursues Nature and plays them with admirable Variety  Were I to expatiate on the various Merits of the three beforementioned Performers I should send you a Pamphlet instead of an Epistle so shall only add that the Contention here concerning WOFFINGTON has been wherein she shone most whether in Tragedy or Comedy She's great in both but the latter gives her an Opportunity of shewing the greater Variety and she's so much a Mistress of  her Profession 'tis scarce easy to determine what Cast of Parts most properly belong to her since I have beheld her with uncommon Admiration as a  Jane Shore  an  Hermione  and  Andromache  a  Constance  a  Lady Betty Modish  and a  Lady Pliant  in the Space of a few Weeks Mr SHERIDAN is excellent in  Maskwell  and CIBBER and WOFFINGTON are highly entertaining in the drole Characters of  Sir Paul  and  Lady Phant  Tho' my Paper is almost full and your Patience I doubt not well nigh tired I must mention her extraordinary Performance in  Phoedra  Her Attitudes were gracefully picturesque justly adapted to her various Descriptions and Passions None seem'd forced or studied Her Countenance was equally expressive and she so well managed her Voice she neither wanted Power or Variety through the whole Part Her  Queen Catherine  also in  Henry the th  and  Volumnia  in  Coriolanus  were fine Performances Nor can I decline giving Praise to CIBBER in the Character of  Wolsey  which he performed at his second Benefit the principal Actors here have two each in one Season to a vast Audience with deserved Applause  To conclude Of the three Performers I have here mention'd I think may be justly said what a late celebrated Writer observed of one of them  Judiciously considered in their various Lights they are but barely received as they deserve when the Audience appears most favourable to them  I am Sir c  ADVERTISEMENT  AS I find there are People in the World capable of hearkening to and receiving the grossest and most improbable Falshoods as Truth and having fatally experienced the Error of negligently suffering such Scandal to pass unnoticed or unanswered I now think it an indispensible Duty to myself and the Public to prosecute such Vilifiers as the Law directsin order therefore to bring such Vilifiers to Justice I hereby offer a Reward of Five Guineas to any Creditable Person that will bring legal Proof of any Inventor Propogator Writer Printer or Publisher of any scandalous Libel  c  against me  THE CIBBER  Octob
