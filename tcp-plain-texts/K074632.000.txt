Habit  BOOK THE FIRST  CELESTIAL Maid from genuine Science sprung  Thee the pretended Sage whose leaden eye  Inwrapt in metaphysic gloom ne'er deigns  A cheerful smile thee with contracted brow  And haughty gesture all his vassals shun  While by the Graces drest Instruction owns  Thy guiding hand Celestial maid attend  Tho barren be the subject o'er its' wilds  So may a verdure not their own be shed  And blooming flowers With me then turn thy sight  On the prime Infantstate of helpless Man  On the first dawn of life when Nature now  Ushers her tender offspring into day  Observe the young ideas how they wake  In gradual order till at length matured  By time they speak a living soul within  View too the transient flash of mirth the ills  Not real yet afflictive the quick thought  For ever varying glanced from toy to toy  Then constant motion pleases then the ear  Catches at every sound the eye untired  Darts its wild ray and every object thrills  The newborn sense with joy Come Virgin teach  How on the government of these first years  Depends the future Man no vulgar theme  No fruitless task experiencing thy aid  WE write to reason Hence ye doating train  Of Midwives and of Nurses ignorant  Old Beldames grey in error positive  And stiff in prejudice whose fatal care  Oft death attends or a life worse than death  O YOUTH whoe'er thou art to beauty's charms  A slave to all that inexpressive grace  Which native modesty and truth bestows  On their more beauteous minds and which exalts  Britannia's Daughters o'er the female world  Is thy Beloved propitious Doth the god  Kindle his nuptial torch And dost thou wish  The name of Father amiable humane  To view thy little Progeny around  Happy wellformed and strong Attend the Muse  Th' instructive Muse shall teach thee to obtain  Thy heart's desire And say wilt thou fair Nymph  Complacent heed with favourable eye  The moral lay refined and pure To thee  Custom hath given while active life shall call  Thy Husband forth amid its boist'rous walks  Domestic rule Thine is the nursery's charge  Important trust from him what absence hides  Thy constant anxious care shall well supply  HEALTH is the greatest blessing Man receives  From bounteous Heaven by her the smiling hours  Are wing'd with transport she too gives the soul  Of firmness without her the hand of toil  Would languid sink the eye of reason fade  To this then bend thy care O Parent Mind  Array thy Child in health a nobler dress  Not gorgeous Majesty can boast the thanks  Of future gratitude thou wilt receive  More than around him from thy treasured hoard  Then showering sums profuse or giving all  Thy herds and bleating flocks tho thousands range  Thy spacious meads or cloath thy ample hills  WOULD'ST thou thy children blest The sacred voice  Of Nature calls thee where she points the way  Tread confident No labyrinth is here  No clue of Ariadne wilt thou need  To Theseus given Fair is her open path  And strong the steady light she casts around  Instinctive light the surest safest guide  THY Child is born See where the treacherous nurse  Or Priestess of Lucina in her hand  The ready medicine brings Forewarned beware  Within the fatal drug lurks death by this  Thousands from yet untasted life retire  Thousands of infant souls yet sanctified  By custom other reasons are assign'd  And Nature is accused of impious deeds  She ne'er committed Nature will preserve  Whate'er she frames and what the Child requires  In his new state sagaciously provides  Both food and remedy Before the sun  Hath from his birth encircled half the sphere  He asks plain as expressive signs can ask  The Mother's breast Without a moment's pause  Hear the mute voice of instinct and obey  Know the first efflux from the milky fount  Is Nature's chymic mixture which no power  Of Art presumptuous can supply this flows  Gently detersive purifying bland  This each impediment o'ercomes and gives  The young unfetter'd springs of life to play  Hence too the Mother is secure The streams  Her Infant's health promoting flow to her  Salubrious otherwise confined or urged  Back to their source what evils may she dread  Sickness and giddy languor shivering cold  And heat alternate dire obstructions pangs  Of sharpest torture cancers by the juice  Of boasted hemlock not to be removed  O MOTHER let me by that tenderest name  Conjure thee still pursue the task begun  Nor unless urged by strong necessity  Some fated some peculiar circumstance  By which thy health may suffer or thy child  Suck in disease or that the genial food  Too scanty flows give to an Alien's care  Thy orphan Babe Oh if by choice thou dost  What shall I call thee Woman No tho fair  Thy face and deckt with unimagined charms  Tho sweetness seem pourtray'd in every line  And smiles which might become a Hebe rise  At will crisping thy rosy cheeks tho all  That's lovely kind attractive elegant  Dwell in thy outward shape and catch the eye  Of gazing rapture all is but deceit  The form of Woman's thine but not the soul  Had'st thou been treated thus perchance the prey  Of death long since no child of thine had known  An equal lot severe O unblown Flower  Soft bud of Spring Planted in foreign soil  How wilt thou prosper Brush'd by other winds  In a new clime and fed by other dews  Than suit thy Nature From a stranger hand  Ah what can Infancy expect when she  Whose essence was inwove with thine whose life  Whose soul thou didst participate neglects  Herself in thee and breaks the strongest seal  Which Nature stamp'd in vain upon her heart  O LUCKLESS Babe born in an evil hour  Who shall thy numerous wants attend explore  The latent cause of ill thy slumbers guard  And when awake with nice sedulity  Thy every glance observe A parent might  A Hireling cannot tho of blameless mind  Tho conscious duty prompt her to the task  She feels not in her breast th' impulsive goad  Of instinct all the fond the fearful thoughts  Awakening Say at length that habit's power  Can something like maternal kindness give  Yet ere that time may the poor nursling die  BESIDES who can assure the lacteal springs  Clear and untained Oft disorder lurks  Beneath the vivid bloom and cheerful eye  Promising health and poisonous juice secrete  Slow undermining life stains what should be  The purest nutriment Hence worse than death  Long years of misery to thy blasted child  A burthen to himself by others shunn'd  He wishes for the grave and wastes his days  In solitary woe or haply weds  And propagates th' hereditary plague  Entailing on his name the bitter curse  Of generations yet unborn a race  Pithless and weak of faded texture wan  Like some declining plant with mildew'd leaves  Whose root a treacherous insect gnaws unseen  BUT whether lost in pleasure in the round  Of modish life and dissipation gay  Misnamed polite the welfare of her child  The fair Barbarian looks on with an eye  Distant and cold or imitating her  As faults of higher station always gain  Partial abettors the neglected muse  Hath to the parent in life's middle rank  Tuned her unfructuous lay she shall not cease  Desponding weightier arguments for them  More strenuous more coercive she can bring  To which perhaps selfinterested love  Will ope their listening sense Of mental joys  And pure delight they would not understand  Or relish the description But if health  They covet nor before the genial prime  Wish the stern Fates to cut their vital thread  Those hearts may prove susceptible of fear  Which instinct love and duty could despise  Nor seek We fabled incidents to strike  With superstitious dread the mind but truth  Plain honest truth inspires the homely song  SHE who refuses to her Young One's lip  Her swelling bosom each returning year  Conceives and each returning year sustains  The pangs of childbirth Harass'd by fatigue  The strongest constitution droops but soon  The weaker system like a blighted flower  Falls underneath the shock The nursing time  Was meant by wisest Nature as a stay  A vacant interspace in which the nerves  And threads of life unstrung might reassume  Their native tone endued again with strength  And corresponding freedom to support  The day of toil As a sure medicine  To root out many an illness else untamed  From the soft female frame T'invigorate  The fragile texture and with grateful force  Astringe the fibres morbid and relax'd  But if not e'en these motives can persuade  T' improve her charms new beauties to possess  Is Woman's utmost wish View then the Fair  Who to this sweet employment turns her mind  Delighted Health sits on her polish'd brow  And shews the veins beneath Spreads o'er her cheek  The vermil glow her eyes with lustre fills  Decks her with radiant smiles and all her form  With grace ineffable and comeliness  Invests Enough of theseThe Muse beholds  With rapture some of other kindOh hail  Ye real Mothers Ye whose hearts are full  Of sensibility Who highly pleased  Would not for all the gewgaws Pride can boast  Loosen the magic knot which joins in one  Your Babes and you or see a Hireling share  The love which to a Mother sole belongs  O Thou to whom one of this pious train  I with esteem and veneration bend  Lead on with decent step uncheck'd by fear  To those domestic haunts where peace expands  Her wings and Harmony delighted dwells  Let me behold thee rivet thy fix'd eye  On the young infant Form then press it close  Glose to thy throbbing heart then on it's lips  A thousand kisses print thy eyes with joy  O'erslowing in each feature nicely scann'd  Tracing the dear resemblance of it's fire  And lo where pleased beyond expression pleased  To see thee in the sweetest task employ'd  Of female duty where thy Husband hangs  Enamour'd o'er thy bosom not the night  Which gave thee to his arms bestow'd a joy  To this superior thrilling to the mind  Sincere and homefelt O true name of love  Tender Affection Genuine Source of bliss  Immaculate and pure The transient blaze  Of passion soon subsides thy steadier fire  Time but increases Soft coercive band  Connecting souls Without thee what is life  Mild Halcyon of the breast whose summer wing  Calms every raging storm To thee the wise  The good still offer incense all who bear  No sordid stains nor any but the dull  Or grovelling in her parsimonious mood  By nature form'd or whom with iron hand  Tyrannic Custom rules despise thy sway  THRICE happy She by inclination led  By nought withheld to add this pleasing link  This heartendearing bond to the sweet ties  Of married love But should'st thou e'er be doom'd  Votaress of truth and virtue to resist  Th' attractive warmth by their eternal hands  Implanted to resist the liberal call  Of duty and desire condemned by ails  From causes unforeseen to tear the Pledge  From thy fond bosom while thy sickening heart  Bleeds at the thought condemn'd another's care  T' invoke for him the Babe thy straining eyes  Gaze on with nameless pleasure Let my lay  Direct thy choice for the momentous task  Whom to retain what Parent to adopt  For thy unconscious young one for from her  Not only nutriment perhaps he takes  To life and growth subservient but who knows  How far the stamina yet unevolved  How far the soul herself as yet unformed  For texture vigour passions intellect  On this thy act depend Far from the bounds  Of the rank city let some trusty Friend  Explore the strawrooft cott there firm of nerve  Her blood from every grosser particle  By hardy labour and abstemious Fare  Sublimed the honest peasant's mate shall ope  Her hospitable arms receive with joy  The infant Stranger and profusely yield  Her pure balsamic nurture to his lip  But since the keenest eye may be deceived  And vice will lurk amid the country haunts  To innocence devoted it were meet  T' investigate among the village Tribe  Their Neighbour's mode of life Heeds she the laws  Of matronlike sobriety Her fame  Is it from all suspicion clear Her soul  To wedlock true Feels she a Parent's love  To her own Offspring tenderly benign  Does she her husband's constant heart possess  Nor seeks he foreign pleasure Every doubt  Extinguish'd here still curiously persist  Nor terminate thy search examine round  Her little mansion see if there in spite  Of poverty the step of cleanliness  Attractive Nymph unhesitating treads  Her age too claims thy notice let not time  On restless wing have stolen from her face  The bloom of youth nor be she green in years  For torpid or impaired by frequent use  The flexile vessels which convolved in maze  Wrapp'd within maze secrete the purer stream  Their office will more sparingly perform  Or less nutritious particles supply  And if thy nurse be young the thoughtful mind  Of prudence would not to her charge confide  What claims exactest assiduity  And serious vigilance There are who think  Too subtile in their theory the Nurse  Should with the Mother aptly coincide  In age and temperament but heeding well  The precepts we have given thou may'st neglect  Such trivial niceness Health from each extreme  Removed is not to colour of the hair  Or to complexion tinged with red or brown  Consined Excess thou should'st indeed avoid  Of plump or lean nor would I choose th' adust  And highly bilious or the sable hue  Of clouded melancholy Be it then  Thy primal care to fix on vigorous health  Adorn'd with smiles the lovely progeny  Of constant cheerfulness and sweet content  Nor would I tho confest a quality  Inferior in it's kind not prize the voice  From harshness free whose soft tone can compose  The froward Babe or gently bid it wake  And view the youngeyed morn O thou who help'st  To throng the crowded Town restrain'd by force  Within that court of death where every gale  Is tainted with pollution did the Muse  If some sad cause forbade thee to pursue  The Mother's genuine office to the fields  Serene and rural Lares order forth  Thy tender Infant not from needless fears  And vain precaution did she dare to thwart  The dictates of humanity She sees  What do not to thy eye perhaps appear  The dreadful train of ills which swarm within  Th' unhallow'd precincts Well she knows how few  Out of the many myriads cityborn  Survive in just proportion scann'd with those  Who bask in freer day Yet much avails  A Parent's unabating love and sharp  Is absence to the soul But can'st thou purge  Th' unwholesome atmosphere gravid with seeds  Of latent sickness Suffocation fell  Angina Apthous Sores Eruptions dire  Pertussis sierce and squalid Atrophy  Say can'st thou bid the flagging South speed by  Nor stagnant o'er his muchloved mansion brood  With darkening plume of poison and of death  Prolific When each danger I review  Shudd'ring with fear I scarce would bid thee prove  The Nurse's task tho nought should intervene  Of fatal accident and thou art bound  By every tie of nature to the deed  For can'st thou round thy Infant's brow entwine  A magic wreath Or cause an Angel lift  His shielding arm Thou can'st not Follow then  The precepts of experience yet let oft  Maternal fondness guide thee to the place  Where rests the little sojourner there view  How cherish'd how improved and lingering chide  The rapid step of stillprogressive time  Which hurries thee reluctantly away  BUT can the Mother change unblamed the town  For some sequester'd villa What denies  Her bed of sickness quitted to retreat  And seek the haunts where Peace on flowers reclined  Lists to the warbling songster of the grove  Or from the gentlyrising hill surveys  The grazing herds and rivulet which winds  Meand'ring thro the distant vale Where Health  Sports on the level green and young delight  Smiling attends Where bounteous Nature sheds  Her choicest blessings and with guardian wing  Protects her favourite progeny Retire  My fair Disciple haste to scenes like these  And underneath thy roof invite to dwell  The Fosterer of thy child Despise with me  Th' insipid train of vanity and pride  The foppery of custom quaint parade  Of ceremonial visit idle farce  Of masquerade or ball where real joy  Ne'er entered conversations gayly dull  Unblest by exiled friendship glare of courts  And mummery of the Great Be't thine to walk  With Reason and enjoy th' harmonious voice  Of conscious Rectitude whose soothing strain  Can lift the soul beyond what vulgar thought  Can distantly imagine If thou must  Require another's aid thy place to fill  Her conduct thou direct and regulate  The manner of her life a pleasure this  Inferior yet affording ample room  To gratify the smer nerve of love  To see thy Substitute at stated times  The lifesustaining food supply to mark  How thrives her young Dependent and each day  Appears addition manifest to gain  In size and stature while his eyes beam forth  At least to Fancy's peering search the dawn  Of future reason and intelligence  HERE as in all things Nature opens wide  Her page instructive Did'st thou not behold  How in her homely dwelling Health imbued  With reseate tint the cheeks and firmly strung  The muscles of her elder boy thy Nurse  Hath left behind She was not surfeited  With dainty cates and high luxurious fare  When him she suckled never did a draught  Stronger than water pass her thirsty lip  Pernicious ale she knew not When released  From short confinement to her various wants  No Friend no Servant minister'd her Babe  She fill'd then gave up to the soft embrace  Of sleep meanwhile no sedentary life  She led she spun the woof in order meet  She set her cott the viands she prepared  With which at eventide to welcome home  The Husband whom she loved Or in her arms  Bearing her grateful burthen out she hied  Braving the summer's heat or winter's cold  And as she walk'd caroll'd th' incondite lay  Of rustic merriment Seek not to change  Her usual regimen for if thou dost  Should she escape the fever which impends  Expect thy Child attack'd by cholic pangs  To writhe in torture or perhaps at once  Convulsions sierce shall snatch him from the world  For now her stomach which from diet hard  By habit's force and potent exercise  Elaborated chyle of blandest sort  Oppress'd by crudities corrupts the blood  With viscid recrement Or else the Brain  That source of motion urged by sympathy  Creates new impulses of morbid kind  The vital threads affecting and from thence  Th' elastic arteries and ruddy stream  Within their coats contain'd the different glands  Their various store secreting nor escapes  Among the rest the lacteal tide the food  By nature of thy Child but now his bane  O HABIT Powerful Ruler of Mankind  Great Principle of action Reconciled  By thee to every clime the human Race  O'erspread this globe around the frozen pole  Scorn the stern brow of Winter nor beneath  Th' equator's torrid influence dread the shafts  Of vengeful Phoebus thou presidest wellpleased  Over th' innocuous vegetable meal  Which on the banks of Ganges or of Ind  Satiates the temperate Bramin Thou can'st tame  To wholesome nourishment the sanguine feast  Of th' everroving Scythian To thy laws  We subjugate the willing neck profest  Thy vassals nor the mental faculties  Dost thou not sway by thee inwrapt in maze  Of subtle politics the Statesman plans  His fraudful schemes unceasing Thou sustain'st  The Sage who labours for the public good  With patriot care though oftentimes assail'd  By black ingratitude The midnight lamp  Of meditation trimm'd by thee reveals  To keen Philosophy Truth's awful face  And all his toil is pleasure Led by thee  The Bard retreats from Vice's noisy reign  And in the secret grot with Fancy holds  Delicious converse while her hand withdraws  The veil from Memory's ideal store  And all th' associated tribe of thought  Displays before his view Still may I bend  Before thy shrine O Habit when thy rules  With Nature's disagree not neither then  May we unpunish'd break them else in vain  Shalt thou attempt to fasten round my heart  For know that Reason and her Sister Form  Fair Virtue can untwist thy magic cords  And to their will tho not annihilate  Can all thy laws attemper and refine  END OF THE FIRST BOOK

elate who cast a glance  Of supercilious scorn on strains like these  Stiling them low While sweet Humanity  Attentive listens vain the Cynic sneer  Or Cynic frown She her warm cheek suffused  With blushes sprung from conscious virtue owns  She thinks no task too mean no work too low  Whose end is public good would save a life  Rather than deck herself in glittering robes  And boast of titled honours sooner give  One ornament to grace the Commonweal  Than purchase a whole empory of wit  Come modest Dame and o'er my numbers meek  Preside come with Simplicity who hates  The swelling phrase bombast th' insipid term  Pompously introduced as Artists vile  O'er forms uncouth their dazzling colours spread  And mock the eye She too shall bid the train  Of haughty Ignorance for 'tis the curse  Of Pride to be with Ignorance conjoined  Keep far aloof nor read the hallow'd lay  YET not alone to Women do We write  The Nurse or Mother Subjects such as these  Oft have the Sages old of Greece or Rome  In studious mood employed full well they knew  That from the birth those Heroes must be form'd  Whom Athens might with future joy admire  Or hardy Sparta Heroes who might urge  To their sublimest pitch the rights of men  Brave every danger for their Country's cause  And make the Persian tremble tho inclosed  By countless Millions Heroes who might act  Deeds which the Gracchi would not blush to own  Or Scipio bravest noblest of mankind  Themes such as these employ'd the generous soul  Of Locke when with the patriot spirit fired  Of Plato or Lycurgus He assay'd  The manly task from custom's harpy claws  And the soft lap of luxury to snatch  The Babe t' enervate idleness foredoom'd  Or sickly languor to connect his mind  With vigorous organs it's impulsive will  Apt to perform and run with ease and strength  The great and difficult career of life  Desirous to behold our British Youth  Outrival ancient fame Come then ye Sires  Whom love of Offspring or of Country sways  You will approve my verse the Nursery's care  From you will gain attention Wisdom's voice  And deep philosophy to you have taught  It's consequence and worth Oh aid the toil  Of a fond Mother with your reason guide  Her gentler faculties invigorate  Her virtuous weakness to your wellknown voice  She will she cannot but with pleasure yield  And follow precepts sanctisied by You  WHAT aliment the tender Babe requires  How best sustain'd the Muse proceeds to sing  To Nature then attend She hath prepared  No food but milk alone and if it flows  In plenteous rills abundant is the store  Thus fed the lamb over the grassy turf  Sports frolicksome the patient ox who turns  Sweltering all day the stubborn glebe by this  Nourish'd at first his present strength acquired  And will thy Infant cease to thrive supplied  With this nepenthe Rather He will gain  New vigour every hour and healthful smile  Tho sickness scoul around Yet some there are  Who fill from morn to noon from noon to eve  Nay thro the hours of night the suffering Child  With various cates heedless of nature's lore  Cruelly kind unknowing that they thus  Fatten a victim for the hungry grave  For from repletion every ill severe  Which threatens childhood arm'd with keener force  Invades the delicate frame How oft 'twere sit  The Suckling should imbibe the milky stream  From the first dawn of morning till the sun  Set in the west experience must evince  All do not feed alike some greedily  Drain at a meal the lacteal beverage  Others more nice require the frequent treat  YET when Night spreads her mantle o'er the Globe  And leads on sleep and silence it is meet  T' obey her mandate rest thy careful head  O Mother let thy tender Nurseling rest  Why wilt Thou anxious to thyself create  Unnecessary pain At evening close  Forth from her den starts the fell Lioness  And thro the gloomy desart urges on  Eager for prey her rapid step She leaves  Her sleeping young one nor expects he food  Till she return with morning's early beam  Yet this is He who shall hereafter reign  Lord of the forest and with kingly voice  Appal his listening subjects But thy heart  Is soft and cannot bear thy Infant's cries  Oh Heaven forbid that I should wish thy breast  Steel'd to his real misery But these  Are cries which evil custom hath begot  And blind indulgence unalarm'd sustain  A few short trials bear unmoved the shock  At first indulged not He will fret no more  Believe me nor from hunger nor from pain  These wailings spring How different is the shriek  And agonizing groan from sobs like these  Transient and humorsome To cloath thy Child  With health some little violence endure  Nor to the dictates plain of candid truth  Thy ancient Nurse's doating saws prefer  THE Stomach ever full is ever weak  But from refreshing sleep and abstinence  Digestion thrives and kindliest nutriment  Th' absorbent veins inhale wherewith the warm  And plastic arteries by due degrees  Upbuild the human fabric or by which  Each slender thread and fibre is evolved  Gaining mysteriously their destined bulk  And firm elastic motion Robb'd of sleep  The Warrior droops his head and longs no more  To plunge amid the fight The Rustic faints  Vigorous e'erwhile nor strains his sinewy arms  Holding the plough but nerveless and unmann'd  Presses his homely pallet sending forth  Vain wishes to the Power who from him flies  And can the gentle frame of Woman bear  Constant disturbance and unrest Her strength  Melts down apace the bloom forsakes her cheeks  A peevish listlessness succeeds she pines  And oversedulous is now unfit  To fill that office which she most desires  WOULD'ST Thou thy Child to pass the hours of night  Wrapt in sleep's downy plumage Banish far  The lazy cradle useless but to give  Relief to th' indolent attendant race  Who fain would batten in perpetual sloth  Who shrink at slightest toil and ill deserve  The viands they devour At first indeed  During the circuit of a moon or twain  'Tis fit thy Charge should only eat and sleep  Nature demands it Afterward contract  The hours of sleep by day and in th' embrace  Of carefulness let exercise divert  The lively Infant chiefly when his eye  Now looks around unknowing what he sees  Now when he springs and spreads his little arms  And smiles and utters sounds which strike thine ear  With wondrous pleasure Tho We now permit  Some added food its quality regard  As of important consequence We praise  Above the rest the farinaceous tribe  Bread wellfermented unadulterate  With deleterious alum this with milk  And with the limpid element decoct  Yet always mindful of the golden mean  Be even this with moderation used  Nor ever glut the stomach till it loathes  And the superfluous aliment rejects  The wrinkled Sibyl laugh to scorn and all  Her dreams fallacious when pronouncing this  A sign of health Nature indeed is kind  And various her attempts t' evacuate  What would be noxious and 'tis well thy Child  Hath still sufficing strength But he poor Babe  Had he the sense to guide his appetite  Would shun this consequence of mere excess  No proof of health disgustful to the eye  WE blame thee not for yielding to the voice  Of Error if beneath the solemn garb  Of old experience hid and selfconvinced  Not meaning to deceive how should thy young  Untutor'd mind resist her lore But when  Truth meets thy sight and pointing shews the way  To Nature's bower thy blind associate quit  Enter the hallow'd shade converse with her  Pure Nymph peruse her lineaments divine  And to her voice impartial ope thy heart  IT is not strange that Prejudice should gain  Access to thy soft bosom Who can boast  His freedom Wide and potent is her sway  No Fiend in stronger bonds hath held enslaved  The groaning nations In Cimmerian gloom  Where light ne'er penetrates but Darkness sits  In fixt essential majesty enthroned  Unconscious Sloth by Ignorance compress'd  Brought forth this Monster To the haunts of men  Taking her way the stars grew pale her wings  She spread incumbent o'er the subject world  Nor suffered men to view what slender bounds  Divided them from brutes in torpid state  Plunged deep they lay supine for many an age  Till Aegypt first rebell'd Mother of arts  And boasted fount of wisdom Yet tho bold  Th' adventure She to burst the galling chain  Strove unsuccessful Mid the twilight groves  Of sacred Memphis on the banks of Nile  Prolific wondrous stream or round the walls  Of hundredgated Thebes in union close  With Superstition dwelt the Pest abhorr'd  And underneath her hieroglyphic veil  Incongruous forms commingled Nor in Greece  Reign'd she less absolute her Sages hence  Built their fallacious systems airy shades  And phantoms of the brain with wordy war  Fought in defence each of his waking dream  And suffer'd Truth with Socrates t' expire  How long beneath her power did Europe bend  Prompted by her Ambition eaglewing'd  Taught ancient Rome amid the lust of sway  Intent on crimson conquest to neglect  Humanity and virtue till the pile  By valour rear'd fell from it's giddy height  Shatter'd within by luxury without  Assail'd by savage fierceness Then what depth  Of native gloom of thickincircling night  Witness'd her presence Every art was lost  Each effort of the mind or else sunk low  Grouch'd to the yoke while o'er the puzzled schools  Exalted shook his worse than iron rod  The Tyrant Stagyrite and Physic awed  By Galen's sullen Genius dared not heal  Each lovelier grace each elegance unknown  Each genuine ornament till Taste o'erwhelm'd  With deathlike Sleep in Leo's age revived  Philosophy extinct till Bacon rose  The morning star of science by whose beams  Transfixt as erst the fabled Python fell  Lay vanquish'd huge Authority Then first  Experiment with radiant lamp disclosed  The stores of bigot Time and taught with nice  Laborious hand from each fictious gem  To separate the true Hence day by day  The rigid shackles fall selfloosed or brace  Mankind less strictly we for Nature's laws  Read Nature only Wisdom smiles serene  With freedom bless'd and Fools alone are slaves  AND say wilt Thou in this enlightened age  O Mother single stand and lend thine ear  To hoar and quaint Tradition Wilt thou treat  Thy Child by their opinion whose advice  Thou would'st not follow in one act beside  Judge by thyself What languor what fatigue  Attends the fuller meal What dire effects  What tumults oft from the crude surfeit rise  And why is reason thine if not with care  To govern him whose yet unripen'd frame  Of sense is vacant Tho with greater ease  His stomach may the superplus expel  Than older gluttony yet caution dreads  Events unfortunate the nerves convulsed  Fever and each ill symptom which attends  The growing teeth Unskill'd to curb himself  His appetite guide thou So duly fed  Each meal affording what may satisfy  Not burthen nature on thy happy Child  Hygeia shall with eye propitious look  His shall be comely vigour winning smiles  Freedom from pain protection from disease  And stamina wellknit to undergo  Each future change of evervarying life  Each toil each danger nay perhaps a base  On which hereafter may be firmly rear'd  Each virtue social public warm resined  Each intellectual moral excellence  FOR tho the Child of weaker nerves may seem  With quickest parts endow'd yet should he rise  Thro numerous perils to the height of Man  Oppress'd with listless torpor how can he  Brave the meridian ray of public life  Reflecting on himself how shall his mind  Expand t'ward other's feelings Nay too oft  Those blossoms immature of sense on which  We gaze with pleasure and astonishment  Spontaneous from the blighted stalk descend  Or yield harsh tasteless fruit This stroke severe  Thou shalt avoid more rationally kind  If form'd by nature delicate thy love  Guided by judgment shall his strength improve  At least his weakness or th' effects it brings  Shall not proceed from errors of thy own  Thou wilt not gorge thy Child and all night long  He sleeps serene an interval of rest  In which the stomach clear'd of every load  Fortuitous its healthful state preserves  He wakes alert prompted by hunger keen  T' imbibe the draught nutritious Thee too Sleep  Hath charm'd with opiate rod no froward cries  No tortures of thy Infant caused by crude  Unwholesome or accumulated fare  Have broke thy tranquil slumbers Thou too seest  Placid the break of morn and to thy Babe  The wellsecreted copious aliment  Preparest to give which sad anxiety  And restless hours in her who idly fond  And painfully solicitous hath watch'd  The night for other purposes design'd  Rob of its balmy essence else derived  Sprightly and plenteous from the genial chyle  A weak thin vapid unsubstantial juice  Whence to the tender organs of her Babe  A morbid irritation which destroys  Their natural and necessary tone  Till haply dire disease or death ensues  Is there a stronger

THIRD  AGAIN from busy care from thoughts which prey  On the reflecting mind from the rank walks  Of Men where folly dwells and base design  And flattery mean and servile complaisance  From the dissembled Friend whose hollow heart  Professing service aims but to deceive  I seek the Muse whose charms can softly steal  Affliction from itself whose power can smoothe  The paths of rugged toil can heal the wound  Of discontent and calm the throbbing breast  Of indignation To my theme again  Wellpleased I turn and view the simple race  Of Infant Innocence as yet unwarp'd  By education blameless nature their's  And passions undebauch'd from envy free  From guile and that assembled crew of ills  Produced by commerce with a tainted world  AND say wilt Thou to whom long since had flow'd  The grateful strain if apprehensive doubt  Had not shrunk fearful from the public eye  And dreaded lest thy praises should appear  Link'd to our slighted numbers Say wilt Thou  CULLEN Unrivall'd Master of thy art  Of soul acute throughout the winding maze  Of every devious system to pursue  And mark the steps of error By whose aid  Edina rears her Academic palm  While to thy precepts listening gathers round  Attentive Youth from each fardistant shore  And bigot envy droops beneath the ray  Of thy superior lustre In whose heart  Dwells candour inmate of the truly great  And modest diffidence Whom judgment sage  By long experience taught directs to fix  The bounds of theory ne'er own'd a guide  But where observance faithfully severe  Hath ceased to pry yet by her labours skill'd  As with a glance nicely to separate  What vulgar minds by seeming likeness caught  Absurdly blend and deem thy conduct rash  Till they behold with wonder health array  Those cheeks in rosy mantle lately view'd  As death's pale harbingers For to thy eye  Memory her fairest tablet swift presents  And method gives that readiness of thought  By them ascribed to fancy but which springs  From painful application Say wilt Thou  Accept our tributary verse Thou wilt  For in thy breast the softer graces dwell  Nor hath Philosophy with stern controul  Lessen'd the milder virtues of the Man  Thine is the breath sincere of friendship thine  Compassion's unaffected ardour thine  The Husband's and the Father's tender love  And warm benevolence incircling all  AT length from stricter vigilance the Child  Is freed O Mother wean'd from thy embrace  Yet the refused thy bosom still attend  With guardian mind still prize our lays for thee  For Him attuned sincere however else  Wanting due ornament nor haply needs  Important truth the vivid dress of words  The tinsel decorations which the song  Inferior claims Nine moons are past twelve more  As we have taught proceed such thrifty fare  Is best thy Child's pure nature doth not ask  Variety of meats He thrives He grows  His cheeks unsullied bloom his soul expands  Thou seest his smiles his gay incessant voice  Resounds what covets thy fond wish And now  His strength increased his more elastic limbs  By constant motion exercised his teeth  Given for utility not shew demand  Food more substantial Yet by every grace  Which doth or ought t' inspire the female breast  By holy temperance by every nice  Exciting sensibility but chief  By that internal sting which goads the soul  To potent love of offspring I conjure  I charge thee Mother Friend with strict regard  Consult thy Child's unvitiated taste  Oh as Thou would'st th' invenom'd adder shun  Renounce their false opinion who seduced  By ignorance misjudging think whate'er  Delights their grosser appetites will please  Will suit his unhabituated lip  And thus unknowing but with liberal hand  Cherish their Babes with poison Wretched Race  Unconscious Criminals Murthering thro love  The hapless Beings they would die to save  By social laws estranged from Nature's paths  We lead an artificial life and feel  Unnumber'd wants which indolence begets  On fond imagination Polisht high  The cultivated manners yield no doubt  Joys of superior kind hence speaks the stone  At sculpture's touch the breathing Canvas lives  And Poetry and Music fire the soul  A thousand nameless elegancies mix  Our jarring minds and by collision soft  Vanquish their native roughness modest Love  Binds her enchanting Cestus on our steps  The Graces wait we drop the tear humane  Of sacred pity and Benevolence  Tho powerless to relieve affords a sigh  The chaster Genius of convivial mirth  Around our table smiles and drives far off  Brutal ebriety profusion yields  The place to neatness and th' internal sense  Is caterer to th' external Thus upraised  By slow degrees from barbarism obscure  Man gains his elevation Oh how blest  Could everroving Fancy be content  But always on the wing She strains her slight  In quest of novelty Hence every thread  Finestretch'd before must still be finer drawn  Our polisht manners turn to frivolous  The soul of Art neglected We behold  The outward shew unskill'd to comprehend  The large design on parts minute on toys  And splendid colourings we doat reject  The strain emphatic curious of the phrase  Uncommon or sonorons period round  And music must surprize not charm the heart  To elegance succeeds the spurious brood  Of soft voluptuousness Love holy love  The fairest flower life's garden e'er can boast  Falls to the ground and changeful wantonness  Rank particolour'd weed springs forth sure bane  To every virtue Pity dwindles down  To mean selflove and seeming generous  We're but the slaves of vanity We seek  We covet the protracted meal and still  Goad as it palls our jaded appetite  With new incentives Ransack every elime  Commerce the boasted cause for every rare  And stimulating condiment spread o'er  Our northern boards the spices of the south  Adapted to it's habitants to us  Noxious and only fit to gratify  The sense debauch'd which loathes it's proper fare  FOR by cold gales our muscles firmly braced  Act with due force Or else th' ethereal stream  Perhaps condensed flows stronger from the brain  And gives to every limb it's healthful tone  Not so beneath more torrid Heavens there sink  The vital powers to mortal languor doom'd  Unless excited by the quickening warmth  Of aliment more active What to them  Nature commands to us her laws forbid  And tho unconscious of immediate ill  At length the stomach harrasst and o'erworn  By this licentious diet fails the pulse  Weakly contracts each nerve decays old age  Hastes immaturely on and round the brow  Scatters untimely snows The softer Sex  Indulging thus besides the common lot  Suffer peculiar accidents which well  The skilful Muse if so inclined could sing  E'en accidents which thwart the general law  Nor to their muchdesiring souls allow  To clasp a Child and bear a Mother's name  BUT whether Thou beneath the sordid yoke  Of luxury wilt not bend and truly wise  Refined but not enervate view'st with joy  The plain and frugal table such as erst  Angels and Patriarchs sought Or whether warp'd  By tyrant custom as we blushing own  Many there are in these degenerate days  Women the worst of Epicures remove  Far from thy Children each highseasoned dish  Each sauce impregnate with the seeds of fire  Each spice and pungent vegetable none  Admit of foreign or of native growth  SHORT is the time stretch'd to its utmost date  Of Man's existence to contract thy own  Intent yet spare thy Child draw not a veil  O'er the young morn of life From thee He springs  Would'st thou so quickly trace his setting beam  Plunged in death's sable wave ere thou hast run  Thy own brief day Daughter of Fashion no  Tho all thy relative affections fade  And every soft sensation droops beneath  The sickly blast of pleasure tho thou flit'st  On giddy plume and thoughtless mid the wilds  Of vanity and folly we acquit  Thy devious soul of wilful homicide  Read then our moral page and better taught  Know right from wrong and sense by action prove  Should'st thou reject our lays as who can scan  The deeds of mad caprice wellpleased we turn  From gay saloons from courts from haughty wealth  And midnight riot to more gentle scenes  Sure of the spotless heart and it's applause  LEARN from thy Child O Parent He will teach  Full oft the diet suited to his frame  View with what marks of loathing He at first  Rejects the hot and acrid instinct dwells  Within a faithful guard his rapid pulse  And native warmth by these are quickly urged  Beyond their bounds He relishes the bland  And to thy taste insipid these controul  Each motion nor permit his heat to rise  Above it's due degree Nor less he shuns  Destructive Bacchus why then will his Sire  By frequent repetition strive t' o'ercome  Nature's dislike why but because himself  Fond of the rosy God and led astray  By reverend prejudice he wholesome deems  The feverstirring draught Nor wants he names  Of high authority Physicians sage  To justify his creed But Use destroys  The benefit He seeks and if disease  Should wine's assistance claim it then may lose  Its medicinal power To every word  Each act attentive Children imitate  Whate'er they see or hear this principle  Strongly within their little breasts alive  Impels them oft to venture hardy war  Against antipathy Of this beware  The struggle nicely mark and point their aim  To proper objects Nor because You praise  The circling glass and they with many a sip  Vanquish their feelings deem that Nature prompts  To what except more rarely it abhors  INDULGE aversion combat with desire  A maxim safe and just for this by Art  Misled may urge to danger but t' abstain  Will prove at least innocuous Nor believe  That from ourselves We judge and interdict  What our own taste refuses When the frame  Is perfect when the fibres have acquired  Their utmost growth more steady are the laws  Of our corporeal organs less disturbed  To change less subject Never would I shun  The friendly intercourse of souls which wine  In moderate draughts augments We know it's power  To cheer the wretch desponding and forlorn  Upon the sickly couch to mitigate  Stern fever's putrid vehemence excite  The torpid heart till it propell anew  The languidcircling blood in every vein  More strenuously alive to calm the rage  Of phrenzy and imagination's tide  Vagueshifting to controul till reason smile  Full well we know it's power to raise the strength  Of drooping age and in his sluggish limbs  Awake the latent fire But Childhood needs  No foreign aid to stimulate the brain  Ever with rapid speed from forth that fount  Of heat and motion bursts the nervous stream  Each irritable fibre is fullfraught  Almost t' excess nor asks the least supply  Canst thou improve on Nature She this store  Puts to it's proper use this urges on  In due proportion each increasing tube  Muscle and bone and ligament Canst thou  Direct her actions Rather shalt thou find  T' exceed will cause defect thy Child curtail'd  Of his just size and stature weak and wan  And should He rush hereafter madly rush  Amid th' intemperate herd and daily seek  The noisy rout of Comus how too late  Wilt thou repentant mourn thy rash exploit  His appetite first led astray by thee  His early relish of the fervid bowl  NICE and perhaps erroneous in their plan  The younger animals as yielding less  Of due nutrition and digested slow  Some disallow That food prepared from those  Of growth mature thro th' intestinal maze  Less tardily proceeds we not deny  More acrid are the juices it contains  Whence stimulating more it's fibres hard  With labour wrought to chyle The young are bland  Composed of humours suited to the young  Viscous nutritious slower in their course  But as th' absorbents greedily imbibe  Whate'er is nutritive by this delay  They drink their fill and to the solids add  The mild tenacious substance Yet not bound  To partial theory without reserve  We bid thee take thy choice of all the tribes  Which bounteous Heaven affords and common use  Before thee sets of every age and size  All but the stall'd and cramm'd by filthy sloth  And gluttony perverted from the state  Of wholesome nature send the mass corrupt  Of nauseous humours and of rancid oil  Far from thy board In simplest manner drest  Of these one daily meal we grant thy child  But not commixt his be one dish alone  Grudge not with these of vegetable store  A plenteous portion nor permit the bread  To lye untouch'd beside him Thus indulge  His appetite and let him freely eat  Till hunger be sufficed This rule observe  All animals which wildly range the earth  Or fluid air and all of vigorous age  With flesh of darker grain experience finds  More alkalescent these the freer use  Of plants and herbs acescent will demand  The tame the young and those of whiter hue  Require them less Heed well what we condemn  All things which housewife art with care preserves  Acid or salt or saccharine all cates  Of unfermented flour composed or those  Of fulsome sweetness and enrich'd with wine  THESE let thy Child avoid And be his drink  The purest element with which of old  Heroes and Champions at th' Olympic games  Sated their thirst and glorious deeds perform'd  In war and manly exercise or He  The Heavendevoted Nazarene to whom  Cords were as threads when fired with holy zeal  He burst his bonds and with his single hand  Hew'd down opposing armies Hence each spring  And limpid fountain every stream which flow'd  Softmurmuring o'er it's pebbled bed was graced  By wise antiquity with hallowed forms  Pure nymphs and gentle Naiads Well they knew  The virtues of the crystal wave e'er vile  Fermented liquors had enslaved their taste  And thinn'd mankind Pass we th' Atlantic foam  Where Britain o'er her Alien Sons now claims  Disputed sway a hardy people there  Inhabited bold active in the chace  Unequall'd patient of fatigue to foes  Tho unrelenting yet to honour just  True to their plighted faith to strangers kind  Not one of limb deform'd or trembling nerve  Among them dwelt and numerous were the tribes  WE did not root them out with savage hand  And bathe their fields in blood but to their lips  More slyly proffer'd the Circean charm  They drank the poison down and by degrees  Relinquish'd their paternal fields to us  Rare scatter'd are their clans some quite extinct  Potent of yore ere the destroying draught  Was introduced The remnant are corrupt  Perfidious treacherous European cups  Have taught them every European vice  Still flourishing perhaps had they disdain'd  The snare contented with the simple streams  Which issue from their rocks Give then thy Child  The blameless fluid friendly to mankind  From whence Hygeia fills her sacred urn  Nectar of paradise nor will He gain  Unless debauch'd a liquor to his taste  More grateful Nay would'st thou if age permit  And strength unbroken thy example add  Trust me no other beverage will so well  Assist digestion none the spirits cheer  Inspire with calm serenity the mind  And make the night glide by in tranquil sleep  BUT lo where with Vertumnus comes the Nymph  Presiding o'er the garden in her hand  Waves Amalthea's horn whence prodigal  Her freshest store descends She asks me why  This long neglect And bids me sing her gifts  Her various fruits whose juices the warm fdun  By secret fermentation hath matured  From aqueous acid bitter and austere  To rich luxurious flavour Hither lead  The Childish train indulgent let not fear  In scanty measure to their taste impart  The ripe and wholesome banquet Still while roll  The summer months along while heat intenfe  Darts through our frame and stimulates our nerves  Till languor each o'erlabour'd thread subdue  And in each tube the purple current teems  With seeds of putrid violence to them  The summer months innocuous roll along  Innocuous glows the fervid sky controul'd  Their baneful influence by Pomona's aid  FOR them unsparing for we scarce can set  The limits of restriction pluck thy fruits  Nature's delicious antidote 'gainst all  The hidden venom of the fultry year  Mild cooling saponaceous nutritive  For them the blushing berry underneath  It's verdant leaf is hid for them adorns  It's rough and prickly shrub for them depends  The clustering currant from it's smoother stem  For them is deck'd each tree The ruddy peach  The golden apricot the cherry boast  Of Kentish soil the fragrant nectarine  The plum green purple azure the moist pear  The apple theme of the Silurian Bard  In fulness of profusion grow for them  Nor would I when by chance more vigorous suns  It's harshness meliorate not cull for them  Th' autumnal grape nor to their lips forbid  The wellrear'd melon nor th' Ananas' rich  And poignant crispness They are form'd for all  And all for them More cautiously supply  Whate'er by rough or bitter husk and shell  Is circumscribed and all the hoard which asks  The mellowing hand of age Or those we gain  From climes fardistant ere they have acquired  Their just perfection gather'd shaddock crude  Pomegranate orange Let Hesperia's Sons  Let th' Antillean Planter or the Tribes  Of fertile Asia gratify their taste  With all th' unlabour'd bounty of their soil  Yet is not our's ungrateful industry  Here cloathes our fields our gardens and our groves  With plenty all it's own Pomona smiles  For cultivation oft bestows a zest  Which wild exuberant Nature would deny  ERE yet we close the strain one error more  The Muse will combat Tenderness may prompt  Whene'er thy Child shall ask thee to bestow  The needless viand In his younger days  We bound thee not to rules But now when o'er  His head four annual suns have roll'd advise  That he be taught submission to the laws  Of social life which stated hours appoints  For action and repast Nor heed the voice  Of ignorance which talks of exercise  And quick digestion Often well we know  The vicious taste of idle wantonness  Demands restraint But lest to thee it seem  As real hunger from the coarser loaf  A pure tho homely nutriment supply  His craving thus with certainty detect  Fictitious appetite His other meals  Yet undirected both at morn and eve  Be fresh drawn broths and milk in various forms  With rice or other farinaceous grain  Inspissated We would not stint thy Child  And know his growth requires a constant flux  Of plastic fluids nay 'tis best to err  If err in quantity the flexile tubes  Of Children will perhaps with ease transpire  What is redundant But with heed observe  Add thy discretion to the Muse's lore  And reason and experience be thy guides  Now duly taught by thy maternal care  O never may He turn his vagrant steps  Aside to dwell mid the polluted tents  Of bestial luxury We would not wish  A stoical indifference to fly  Forever those delights which sway mankind  Th' exhilarating bowl which opes the heart  And festive banquet where preside the powers  Of wit and decent mirth but may He live  Born for society no hermit sour  Or driveling moralist absurdly grave  And singularly dull Temperate by choice  But not austerely abstinent By thee  Is the foundation in his primal years  Firm laid by which he need not sacrifice  To rigid niceness but with health his friend  Will not start back from every little change  Which weaker habits must with caution shun  Or cannot with impunity indulge  Thine is the work and gratitude shall then  Repay the debt the filial debt he owes  Then shalt thou feel tho strong th' instinctive tye  Of blind affection what sublimer joys  Reason affords the generous mutual bond  Thy tender love his tribute of the soul  THUS far the Muse Didactic hath assay'd  Her purposed theme scattering before the steps  Of Truth and Science o'er their toilsome paths  The not unfrequent flower the sweets which bloom  On those delicious banks forever green  Fed by translucent rills which murmuring sweep  O'er sands of gold where Fancy loveliest Nymph  Delighted strays or with the Sylvan powers  Dryads and Fauns disporting joins the dance  And sings her wildest note or silent stands  Her roving eye her giddy step enthrall'd  Attentive to Minerva's heavenly voice  Enamour'd of her wisdom and from Her  Receives the potent wand by Judgment form'd  And waves it o'er her works which thence remain  Unfading and immortal Rest not here  O Virgin still be Infant Man thy theme  And what of cloathing what of exercise  He needs relate nor his diseases scorn  With hand benign to paint and teach the cure  THOU wilt not if the sharp inclement air  Of cold neglect freeze not thy vital warmth  And in the cave of solitude fast bind  Thy wings aspiring which shall shed their plumes  Of varied die or fold thee ever round  In sullen indignation Rather far  From thee be thoughts like these Stoop not thy soul  To fears of vulgar nature high above  This sordid earth direct thy piercing eye  And view where rear'd beyond the gulph of Death  Stands Fame's refulgent dome to living Wight  Aye inaccessible Still as of yore  Thou sought'st th' Ascrean or the Mantuan Bard  Thy visions spread before my raptured sight  And soothe my ear with those celestial strains  Which on Olympus' lofty top reclined  Charm Jove himself while virtue reason truth  Humanity and love each sound applaud  And bless th' unprostituted lyre Oh hail  Ye pure ethereal Bards who nobly stoop'd  To teach mankind who round the flowing locks  Of fancy cast the sacred wreathe inwove  By the fair fingers of Utility  Which scorns caprice and whim amusive toys  And trifles vain th' unprofitable gawds  Which catch the light and airy mind of Youth  Or vacant Pleasure Hail again ye Bards  Nor only ye of Greece and Rome who first  Stole from the croud profane my chastened thoughts  And as I gazed upon your page inspired  The holy frenzy of ambitious love  Aiming with ardent but successless toil  To emulate your beauties Ye too hail  Ye sons of Britain Masters of the song  Thou AKENSIDE late wept by every Muse  Whose skilful hand unlock'd the secret source  Of mental pleasure founded in the new  The graceful and sublime Nor blind to worth  Tho still upon this waveworn shore it stand  Of troublous life by envy's blasts assail'd  Be thou ungreeted ARMSTRONG in my verse  Thou Parent of the Prophylactic Lay  Nor MASON thou whose polisht taste instructs  To form the English Garden mingling art  With rural wildness and simplicity  Nor BEATTIE Friend of Truth whose Gothic harp  As if from magic touch emit such tones  That e'en Apollo might his lyre forget  And wonder at the harmony while pleased  In Edwin's ripening Genius we behold  The progress of thy own Hail too ye Friends  Of Nature and the Muse of soul refined  Of judgment unimpair'd by slavish Art  Unmanacled who feeling dare confess  The pleasure which Ye feel who mid the scenes  Of calm retirement from the genuine cup  Nectareous virtuecrown'd drink true delight  While the mad riotous crew at distance heard  Disturb not your pure ears nor aught inspire  But pity and contempt To you alone  These Bards have sung to you alone I sing  O LET me mingle with the hallowed band  By you exalted Let me scorn with you  The base luxurious dissipated Great  Who to the yoke of every foreign vice  Bow down the neck disgraceful and retain  Only the name of Britons Strangers They  To every wish each thought of nobler kind  Absorb'd in selfish joys of public good  Of private virtue heedless Skill'd to game  To waste their trifling hours beneath the shade  Of indolence to steer the fragile bark  O'er the smooth wave of folly They applaud  What taste condemns their highest excellence  To deck with richest offerings the vain shrine  Of those Musicians who distort the most  The native elegance and most pollute  Each charm of Melody or those who urge  The human voice divine to heights which well  Madness might emulate While JACKSON'S strains  Breathing in every note the soul of love  Of passion feeling sense and sentiment  Flow unrewarded save that Nature stands  Listening and drinks in every thrilling sound  Delicious but unprofitable meed  Of elevated Genius Fond of shew  Of pompous scenes of barren novelties  Of tortured incidents and poor finesse  Filch'd from the Gallic or Italian stage  They relish not while they pretend t' admire  Our Shakespeare's matchless energy The voice  Of wisdom they despise the sacred lyre  They trample in the dust a catch a glee  A song obscene a libel which destroys  Some good man's peace of mind and blasts his fame  Strikes their weak souls with

Of Youth on Fancy's pinions wasted back  The daring Visitor of times unknown  And future ages like a spicy breeze  Steals her delicious fragrance like a breeze  From Zeylon or Sumatra which enchants  The Sailors heart tho night involves the coast  And hides it's lovely foliage from his view  While in his mind He sees the blooming groves  And haply thinks them fairer than they are  SWEET o'er my bosom stole the breath of Fame  In early life on Fancy's pinions borne  Th' ideal prospects rose supremely fair  And in extatic vision I beheld  Perennial bays distinguishing my tomb  For not unuseful or of light import  The strains I sung And though mid glades obscure  Dwelt the sequester'd Muse from riot far  From pomp imperious and the lordly board  Begirt with servile slatterers yet her breast  By human kindness sway'd where'er had pierced  The British language manners arts and arms  Revered the Good and baseborn Envy dead  Or vanquisht or engaged with living worth  Exulted in th' esteem of times to come  And Virtue's mutual friendship unreserved  In distant Continents where horrid War  Now stains with Brother's blood the guilty soil  In distant Islands mid their nodding palms  And growing sweets her eyes survey'd with joy  The willing Parent bending o'er her lay  DEAR to the youthful mind ye Prospects hail  Ye Visions wideremoved for deep Ye thrill'd  Fixing as real all your traces there  And if illusive all yet riper Age  Can scarce believe the flattering scenes untrue  Or cease the vivid colours to behold  Bright glowing thro the shadowy lapse of years  MEANWHILE O CODRINGTON whose generous heart  Blames not the tenor of my partial song  By whom uncensured flows the selfapplause  Whose temper mild as an autumnal sky  No cloud obscures with feelings warm yet ruled  By cautious judgment in whose breast resides  Friendship's pure Heavendescended flame alive  To all a Parent's fondest love yet both  Under superior reason's nice controul  Directed to their truest end and use  For thee and such as thee an audience small  In space and number circumscribed by wealth  By rank and titles undebased again  I venture the Pierian spring to seek  And tread on sacred ground How difficult  Where thro the laurel groves and myrtle shades  The verdant alleys lawns and rising slopes  Thick strewn with flowers of every various hue  Of every various season Elegance  Coy Nymph unsated wanders on each scene  With curious eye commenting from the sweets  The neverfading blooms each virid arch  Selecting meetest garlands to suspend  Upon the tree of Taste most eminent  In the poetic region underneath  Whose fragrant shelter Phoebus and the Nine  In chorus met attune their happier strains  Of rarest harmony How difficult  By Health and Youth attended to pursue  The bashful Maid attract her favouring eye  And wooe Her to bestow a single wreathe  CAN I then hope whom sickness long hath drench'd  In her Lethaean dews with feeble limbs  And wan complection from her hands to bear  Those gifts which unpossesst my lays must creep  Dully monotonous nor touch the heart  Nor win th' approving mind Yet witness Thou  Witness my Friend Who know'st the human frame  Each drug of cordial each of healing power  To me in vain administer'd what toil  I must experience now the Nymph to trace  Through her meand'ring walks what partial chance  Should she my languid homage not disdain  YET thy inciting voice the conscious thought  Sprung from the love of kind which tells Me all  Will not be frustrate nor the darling wish  Of public good be wholly unfulfill'd  Some loitering sparks of that once brighter flame  My soul enkindling prompt me to a task  Long interrupted Where in slumbers deep  It rests t' awaken the Didactic Lyre  With it's more solemn notes to mingle tones  So they to memory fail not to recur  Oft heard of yore as t' ward the lucid fount  I stole not unforbidden tones which please  Heighten'd the more by contrast and engage  Amusive the charm'd ear till it imbibe  Instruction with delight till melody  Not the chief object seem it's liquid voice  Yielding to reason's energy divine  OF Cloathing now of Heat and Cold We sing  Unanimating themes but which require  Th' attention of the Bard as not of use  Inferior to the subjects which erewhile  He strove t' adorn nor claiming notice less  From the true bosom of Parental Love  STILL heed We Nature and her guiding steps  Pursue nor tho with moans and plaintive cries  From his concealment issues to the light  Man's tender Progeny believe He feels  Th' external air his undefended frame  Keenly invade These moans these cries proceed  From other causes To his lungs at once  Expanding their nice substance rushes in  The forceful air The circulating blood  Alters it's course thro channels unessay'd  Impell'd whose first resistance haply claim  Exertions of the labouring heart quick strong  If not convulsive yet irregular  Exertions of the lungs themselves to gain  Their necessary powers and genial spring  Add too that oft each muscle every limb  Strain'd and compresst scarce bears the gentlest touch  Sore from the late hard conflict undergone  And agonies maternal But to cold  Know He is born impassive or at least  With vital warmth supplied to render vain  It's most severe assault beyond the scale  Of heat which stimulates maturer age  HE needs not Art's assistant hand or dress  Of studied care Uncloath'd in wilder climes  Like the more hardy natives of the soil  E'en in the polar regions He might brave  The freezing atmosphere Nay unwithheld  By dubious fears tho placed indeed beneath  More favouring skies there are who from his birth  Plunge th' infant stranger in the gelid wave  Where unappall'd the mother too enjoys  The bath's refreshing coolness But nor harsh  Nor fanciful We shall not recommend  To Thee more delicate in form and mind  Daughter of Britain these examples drawn  From savage nations and from tribes remote  Cloath'd be thy Child so polisht custom wills  And decent manners But in airy garb  Loose and uncinctured Thus He shall avoid  The torment of accumulated heat  Nor from unnatural coercion feel  Distress and anguish With minuter rules  To croud the page and dull or quaint describe  His vesture what materials should compose  Each article and whether by the loop  Or pin restrain'd tho as the last may bring  Danger nay death the caution which forbids  It's use above the trivialseeming cause  Important rises descants such as these  Prolixly mean would argue in the Muse  Failure of judgment no respect to Thee  Suffice the general maxim to dilate  And to the test each consequence reduce  Be thine Bright glows the warm maternal soul  And clear illumined by a hint alone  NOR flows with that necessity the strain  As erst it might when barbarous hands around  The newborn Babe fold over fold inwreath'd  The circling band Amid the wanton gales  Which Luxury breathes amid the changeful swarms  Which Fashion decks in her chameleon hues  Amid th' increasing follies of our age  And vices not perhaps destructive less  Than those of old tho softer milder far  Link'd with humanity and taught to charm  To poison by politeness Justice owns  While the rough virtues of our ancestors  And manly genius We no more behold  Our souls revolt from habits which enslaved  Unamiable their Minds and from the sway  Of Prejudice whose galling shackles long  Their vigorous faculties controul'd This truth  Justice confesses this th' instructive Muse  GLADLY O Mother We congratulate  Thy Infant who from life's first dawn enjoys  His birthright who the vital air at will  Inhales nor feels corporeal bonds With me  Revert thine eyes and Lo their hapless Sons  How braced and pinion'd who t' extend the reign  Of civil liberty with ardour toil'd  Who fought who bled t' extend it Nor escaped  The Race preceding our's See where they lye  True objects of compassion round them close  Is fixt the painful bandage not a limb  Can move sad victims to th' erroneous creed  Which holds that Nature incompletely acts  And forms defective works that Art may give  The strength by her refused and perfect thus  Th' unfinisht system gasping they recline  In real martyrdom The shriek is heard  The groan the sob expressive but in vain  In vain the little Captive as awhile  Released from durance utters sounds of joy  Stretches his arms wellpleased and smiles and casts  His looks delighted on the cheerful blaze  Or waving taper To his fetters soon  Remanded He in vain attempts to cope  With arbitrary power each effort tries  Shews by each deed th' abhorrence which He feels  Adding th' emphatic eloquence of tears  Of inarticulate but deep distress  And struggles allimpassion'd to be free  WITH pity and contempt thy soul beholds  This picture What calamities ensued  Experience proved but idiot bigotry  Confess'd them not Th' evolving principle  Within the plastic juice augmenting size  Thus partially impeded could not urge  The destined fibres onward or enlarge  By due accretion e'en the vital cells  Requiring speediest growth Yet active still  In disproportion'd manner to the head  Unseemly bulk

 For many a year pined underneath the force  Of this domestic torture For as erst  The Mother strove t' assist their infant nerves  And give to weakness strength She now assay'd  Her progeny t' embellish and their shape  To mould as fancied beauty in her eye  Deceptive shone Heaven that the human Mind  Warp'd by imagination should believe  Or e'en suggest it possible the form  Whose archetype the Deity Himself  Created in his image could be changed  From it's divine proportion and receive  By alteration comeliness and grace  That round the Zone which awkwardly reduced  E'en to an insect ligament the waist  The blooming loves should sport enticing charms  And young attractions Heaven that e'er a Bard  The genuine Bard is Natures' sacred Priest  Forgetful of his charge should deck with praise  As fair and lovely what would strike the soul  Unwarp'd by custom as a subject fit  For scorn indignant spleen or ridicule  Yet Prior tho nor taste nor reason blend  Their essence with the verse while lasts the tongue  Thy numbers help'd to polish while the powers  Of melody bear sway the verse shall live  Beauteous description of a Gothic Shape  OH may the manners of thy nutbrown Maid  Her artless truth simplicity of soul  Her fondness and intrepid constancy  Long in the bosoms of the British Fair  Tho banisht every other region dwell  Delighted inmates May their eyes still beam  With all her speaking rays their cheeks endue  Her modest crimson But may never more  "The Boddice aptly laced" their panting hearts  Confine or mutilate that symmetry  Of limb and figure whence a Zeuxis' hand  His allaccomplisht Helen might have form'd  Or a Praxiteles with happiest art  Sculptured a Venus Tho Meridian day  Behold them drest as potent fashion bids  Girt with exterior ornaments uncouth  Trappings disgustful yet at morn or eve  Or when they to the genial bed repair  Still may they charm the melting eye of love  With elegance and grace the fabled Dames  Of classic soil transcending native grace  And elegance unveil'd which mocks attire  RETURN Digressive Muse t' approach the shore  Of Cyprus or to breathe the tepid gales  From Achedivias' Island wafted round  Is not thy choice tho CAMOENS' Shade invite  And MICKLE with his glowing spirit fraught  As each heroic so each scene of joy  Paint with a Master's fire unlimited  By cold translation Never may our strain  One vague idea raise which spotless minds  May blush to own much less insult the glance  Of virgin purity or harshly wound  The conjugal and chaste maternal ear  DIGRESSIVE Muse return our proper theme  Is Man's first helpless state our tuneful aid  Th' ingenuous Parent claims Resolved to bless  Thy Child with ease and freedom taught to shun  By the dire act of Swathing all constraint  So baneful let no part escape thy care  Nor load the head nor till he walk abroad  At least till firmly he can press the ground  Cover the legs or feet Some precepts here  To Cloathing unattached or slightly link'd  We mean t' inculcate Need I then to thee  O Mother whom the soul refined alone  Can prompt t' inspect my numbers recommend  The Virtues' dear Correlative as They  The mental frame so the corporeal She  Adorning rendering pure the decent Maid  Unsullied Cleanliness with Her full oft  Thy Charge to visit Not that to her shrine  E'en from thy tender years thou hast not paid

acrimony pierced tormented shrieks  Or moans incessant Neither scorn as vain  The dictates which succeed from Reason learn'd  BANISH the softer couch let not thy Child  Recline on down his pliant bones but now  From cartilage emerging on the bed  Which yields beneath his weight may haply gain  Thus frequently recumbent a deformed  And twisted aspect by Chirurgic skill  For ever irreclaimable Nor less  Such accident t' avoid with cautious eye  Th' attendant mark who bears him in her arms  And let Her oft his posture shift oft change  From right to left altern A careless Tribe  Purchased by

her the brow  The tone of high command let all her days  Roll on illumed by kindness and esteem  Think her thy fellowlabourer and thy friend  Alleviate every future ill of life  And if thou can'st remove them Ne'er may She  Who with maternal prudence and the warmth  Of zeal affectionate hath lent her aid  To form thy Children to support to raise  From perilous estate to strength and health  Feel the distressful sting of poverty  Or if the means are not withheld in thee  Want a protector But if more than this  Her bosom hath the nutriment supplied  Which thine refused still more may she demand  And thou in justice grant the liberal boon  AND Oh Ingenuous Youth whose blood now flusht  With yet unsatiated desire quick beats  In every pulse to mix in active life  Intent or climb where science points the way  Oh Virgin Who with beauty deckt and gay  In unperverted innocence around  Survey'st thy Homagers yet covetest  One faithful heart alone Oh recollect  Her assiduity her diligence  And tender care to which Thou owest the frame  Able to cope with business or sustain  The toil which knowledge asks to gather in  Her widespread harvest That attentive zeal  To which thou owest the comeliness of shape  Those beauties which from every eye attract  Th' applausive glance and every breast inspire  With love or admiration Recollect  Not frigidly or faintly like the crew  Who every pleasure center in themselves  Not with weak indecisive apathy  But with a bounteous and expanded soul  Estranged from self replete with gratitude  BECAUSE the winged Nations fondly brood  Over their unfledg'd Young because We view  Where'er reclined her newborn Offspring press  Close to the Parent Quadruped because  By instinct irresistible impell'd  The Mother longs t' embrace her infant Charge  And hide it in her bosom while thro wilds  Or o'er the desart mountain as she roves  The Savage still her clinging Babe sustains  Some this communicated warmth affirm  Is needful and that Man's elsedrooping Race  Requires the genial contact Mindless they  How far from Nature's simpleness diverge  Our steps our every action Were the Child  Unclad by day unshelter'd thro the night  We should not hesitate to recommend  What otherwise We smile at or perchance  Hold but of dubious consequence Our lays  Have taught what cold his system can repell  First into light immerging And if cloath'd  As custom bids he from himself will gain  This added warmth condensed and on himself  Recoiling Better thus than haply sunk  Beneath the load which our nocturnal rest  Demands to feel th' intense phlogistic heat  Of temporary fever or to melt  In copious steam away Much better thus  Than by the Mother or the Nurse oppresst  In heavy sleep to frustrate all the schemes  Parental love had formed or placed within  Some ancient Hireling's bed instead of warmth  From generous blood and balmy breath supplied  To warm the shrivell'd Dotard But if laid  From thee remote or in the couch with thine  Conjoin'd why should'st Thou not examine well  And frequently his lodgment so inform'd  Thou can'st not fail O Mother to perceive  What suits his constitution what to add  What to subtract doubtless thy native sense  Beyond my strains will teach thee that when rules  Fierce Sirius lighter vestments will suffice  Than when Aquarius opes his fullfraught urn  And Winter arm'd with piercing frost defies  Th' unwarlike Sun Thy prudent soul will know  His limbs in health blest with the temperate mean  Nor heat nor cold betray Yet truth forbids  To slight exceptions which are often found  Eluding justest rules Should some disease  Attack thy Child and anguish writhe his frame  To shivering pain thy near approach may give  Solace and ease nay as it were foment  Assuage and lull the smart or should He pine  With more than common weakness from his birth  Afflicted blasted or untimely born  With nerves imperfect as th' exotic flower  Thrives not but when included from the winds  It's fibres by the sun's concenter'd rays  Are duly irritated he may want  Thy vital stimulating heat But soon  E'en then attempt increase of strength to give  By other means and seek at first the Bath  Of moderate temperature by slow degrees  Proceeding till his habit can support  The powerful shock which colder lymph imparts  BUT so diffusive is the tyrant reign  Of Fashion such our table's proud excess  Such is our love of cards time's Murderers  Keen agitators of the gentlest breasts  Which ought to be the gentlest such those hours  Those midnight hours corrodent of the bloom  Which else would decorate the female cheek  And animate the lips which now are pale  Such the destructive arts when beauty fades  It's meretricious semblance to display  The lifeless white and nevervarying blush  Detected by the curious eye which hates  The fraud and painted Cytheraea scorns  Such are our Matrons such except the Few  Who nobly singular behold and smile  At Folly's deeds absurd that all who spring  From them may well partake the feeble nerve  And vapid blood in which more faintly glows  The living principle and what for some  We erst prescribed We now prescribe to All  To all their children neither do We think  Even to them the song may flow in vain  For should Caprice applaud who oft usurps  The throne of Sense and guides the public taste  In her wild fit round Merit's brow the wreathe  Intwining which for Folly she design'd  They too may cast a glance across the page  Which Fashion bids them read Know then Ye Fair  Whom tho my heart approves not I behold  With truest pity know th' unhappy Babes  Whom you have toil'd unceasing to produce  Fragile and delicate a word of your's  Perhaps may rescue from impending fate  Oh issue your commands great is the power  Of cold Yourselves no doubt have often sought  In fervid summer it's benign effects  In the salt deep whence braced You might endure  The winter's hard campaign And hence new tone  Your Offspring shall derive their stamina  In some degree corrected while the force  Of nervous influence more intensely thrills  Th' arterial frame and the lax Muscle swells  YE Frigid Springs wherever first appear  Your bubbling sources underneath the grot  Or pendent shade Ye everliving Streams  Where'er Ye wind pellucid thro the vales  Your pastoral mazes or o'er rocks abrupt  Hurl down your dashing foam Ye Rivers wide  Where'er in proud procession to the Main  Your copious tribute rolls to You my song  Should grateful riseYe Naiads who direct  Each scatter'd rill ere in coactive strength  They flow exuberant to your praise attuned  Should sound the note melodious and your names  Would I ye Nymphs recount and joyful paint  Your attributes and virtuesBut your Priest  Your favourite Akenside his hallow'd lays  Hath not in vain effused with pious voice  Hymning your benefits and all around  Your sacred haunts hath cast a magic spell  Forbidding each profaner foot the groves  The caves the dells obscure where Ye sojourn  And your chaste bosoms shelter from the fire  Of scorching Phoebus wantonly t' approach  Or rudely violate Nor shall my feet  Profanely tread your darkembowering shades  Nor shall my roving eye with curious search  Your deep recesses pierce Yet O Ye Springs  Ye Streams Ye Rivers clear And Thou by whom  They all are fed to whom they all return  Exhaustless Ocean with the general song  Which choral Nature pours my voice shall join  Tho undistinguish'd and with all that creep  Or run or fly or vegetate shall own  Your fructifying lifepreserving power  Your power which Thales which the Man of Thebes  Contemplating affirm'd to listening Greece  That water all transcends unrivall'd best  The sole prolific element of things  WHETHER your moisture cloathe th' exulting meads  With herbage or slowdeluging the plain  You fertilize the soil while Millions view  The prospect with delight sure pledge of wealth  Of copiousteeming harvests Whether soft  And gentle your refreshing dews descend  Absorbed by each inhalant leaf and flower  Whether your rains entangle as they fall  Th' electric fluid and with vital strength  Each seed inform each fainting plant supply  Whether You offer to the thirsty lip  Delicious draughts or to the anguid frame  Of sickness your invigorating waves  Wherein to bathe and feel the tonic force  Of Cold at every trial brace the limbs  The heart the brain react at every shock  Till all their pristine energy restored  The fibres move responsive to their sway  And the once loitering blood propell'd anew  Warm thro it's channels to the surface flows  You mid the general song which Nature pours  My grateful strains shall praise For not Unread  In Poeon's hallow'd lore not uninform'd  By chemic Art your healing qualities  I too may boast to know and whence derived  From earths or salts or mineral particles  Combined suspended by attraction's laws  Or held in union by aerial chains  And crown'd with sprightly  Gas  Hence led by hope  By reason led I drank with eager lip  At those salubrious springs which make renown'd  Our British Baiae but th' obstructing cause  Of ill or relaxation faint remain'd  Such mischief waits on sedentary hours  And studious midnight thought Hence now the shores  Of hoary Neptune hence the sounding caves  I seek and turn to the refreshing breeze  My languid face inhaling as I sit  The briny spray or mark the rising sun  Beyond the vast expanse diffusing wide  His glorious beams and at his orient light  Dip in the fluid element nor breathe  To either Power unheeded orisons  SURELY not duped by Fancy I perceive  At times as struggling to be free the trace  Of longforgotten feelings And my limbs  More firmly press the beach And t'ward the flood  I move unaided by ministrant hands  O DAWLISH

Goddess and benignant smile  On her true Votary not Cythera's fane  Not Eryx nor the laurel boughs which waved  On Delos erst Apollo's natal soil  However warm enthusiastic Youth  Dwelt on those seats enamour'd shall to Me  Be half so dear To thee will I consign  Often the timid Virgin to thy pure  Incircling waves to thee will I consign  The feeble Matron or the Child on whom  Thou may'st bestow a second happier birth  From weakness into strength And should I view  Unsetter'd with the sound firmjudging mind  Imagination too return array'd  In her onceglowing vest to thee my lyre  Shall oft be tuned and to thy Nereids green  Long long unnoticed in their haunts retired  Nor will I cease to prize thy lovely strand  Thy towering cliffs nor the small babbling brook  Whose shallow current laves

in general cannot be taught to the Vulgar nor could those of Children be contained in a work like this much less could the skill and judgment be imparted necessary for the administration of RemediesFalse notion because Children cannot describe their feelings that the seats and causes of their Diseases are therefore unknownDiseases of Children not so simple as Some have imaginedThe Causes also are many and variousNecessity of applying for speedy assistanceThis even should it be unsuccessful will binder the remorse which might follow a different conductThe effects of this remorse exemplified in an EpisodeInoculationRise and progress of the SmallpoxIntroduction of Inoculation into Europe by Lady Mary Wortley MontagueThis duty inculcatedConclusion  BOOK THE SIXTH  TO thee whom laudable Ambition fires  Surmounting every obstacle to climb  The height of science rivalling the fame  Of Arbuthnot or Garth or learned Mead  With whom in life's gay morn my heart inwove  A bond of union which no power but death  Can e'er untwine whose warm whose liberal voice  Hath oft approved my strains in this perchance  Too partial yet humane and in the song  Contemplating the Friend This verse to thee  MILMAN as worthier of thy classic ear  I now devote nor would I on thy time  Sacred to public good or studious thought  Intrude the futile levities of wit  Or useless elegance howe'er refined  WITH prudence nursed and by it's precepts formed  Thy Child O Parent haply will ascend  Unhurt to manhood Yet events there are  Which not my lays can teach the means to shun  Nor thy assiduous caution can elude  For He is mortal and to mortal ills  Prone from his birth Each violent Disease  The human race invading may be his  And some confined exert their baleful force  On Infancy and Childhood What thy care  What rural scenes what the pure lymph and food  Aptly supplied what his own active powers  Indulged the frigid bath and cleanliness  With regulation due of heat and cold  Can frustrate or prevent and much they may  He will avoid At least the shafts of Death  Shall oft be blunted Nature's vigorous arm  Her shield protending while her faithful aid  Joins with thy ardent wishes Is thy mind  Anxious and fond with this unsatisfied  And dost thou ask the latent plagues to view  Skulking in ambush know their different signs  Learn their Prognostics fatal or secure  And the resources which progressive Time  Hath found and liberal Practice can select  WHAT wilt Thou gain so taught Augmented fears  Doubled anxiety In every look  If slightly changed in every wanton cry  Or sudden start thy love solicitous  The feeds of dire disaster will perceive  And haste with needless remedies t' oppose  A fancied mischief till thy Infant feels  Perhaps thus often treated real pain  Say that Disease were fixt and that our page  Lay full before thee fraught with justest rules  Could'st thou with timid mind and throbbing heart  Presume t' apply them Would'st thou not immerst  In hesitation all attempts forego  If not the tone and bias of thy soul  Mistaking We for such as thee ne'er strung  The lyre humane nor e'er the lyre will string  YET much the welfare of thy Child We prize  And doubtless even from his natal hour  Beginning could in graphic order paint  Every distemper each appropriate name  Disclose their diverse symptoms and their cure  And when th' instructive plan We first essay'd  Imagination's inconsiderate eye  Colleagued with Youth this finish'd work beheld  But Judgment render'd stronger by the lapse  Of twice seven years rejects the green design  A theme inelegant for verse unfit  Tedious and long and barren and to Thee  Of little profit nay with danger stored  A TASK like this the Muse without regret  Leaves to some  Medicaster  who the quill  Dextrously wielding aims at vulgar praise  We know the failure of Generic marks  Employ'd on Species near the bed of pain  We know what nice distinction is required  What accurate serenity of thought  What sedulous attention to collect  Each circumstance minute and from the traits  Commingled and fictitious to detach  What suits peculiar natures and the turns  Of endless and immense Varieties  WOULD then the Mother would the wary Nurse  If such there be from so disturbed a fount  To them disturbed it's muddy waters draw  And sport with human life Not thus reproach'd  Shall flow my numbers which the hand of rash  Or doating Ignorance shall ne'er supply  With poison Never will I stoop to win  The Multitude's applause by deeds or words  Which candour must despise Nor e'en in song  Reflections cast on others that on me  May light the praise of fools tho plansible  Each note appeared and for the common good  Intended solely Much less with abuse  Degrade the very Art I once profess'd  For conscious of the toil it's practice claims  Th' inquietude the watchful nights the days  To thought intense devote when jovial Mirth  Holds it's nocturnal orgies and the voice  Of empty Vanity is heard at noon  Tho far beneath th' illustrious Great I knew  What form'd their sterling worth and placed them high  Above the selfish mean Empiric race  SUCH were the Sages of th' Asclepian line  Thus from the Coan to th' incipient age  Of Boerhaave lived the Prime of every school  Thus Sydenham over every school Supreme  Such Huxham lately ran his course of fame  While GLASS with evening brightness still adorns  The western sky and proves not yet extinct  The true the genuine Hippocratic beams  Patient t' observe They unremitting scann'd  The book of Nature while their souls enlarged  Took in and added to their proper store  All past experience methodized and clear  How vain their labour if a tract compiled  By some assuming specious shallow Scribe  Could teach th' inferior orders of Mankind  With strict discernment thro the tangled maze  Of it's progressive symptoms to conduct  Each dangerous Malady it's cause unveil  And each adapted remedy prepare  Could these my strains embrace the various ails  Infesting Childhood to thine eyes display  The various antidotes and give that sound  Unerring judgment which alone acquired  By use and contemplation can insure  The proper time of trial can advise  With confidence and justify the deed  YET what We may what nor the Muse forbids  Nor our own sense condemns is freely thine  IF from the Mother's bosom We remove  Those false opinions which her gentle soul  Unwittingly possess if we describe  The limits of her care and when t' invoke  Superior Wisdom's aid if on her mind  Some duties we impress and tyrant fear  And more tyrannic superstition drive  Far from her dwelling not in vain We write  And many a fell disease o'ercome her Sons  Her Daughters shall hereafter bless the day  Which brought these wellmeant numbers to her ear  BECAUSE the Child with reason unendow'd  And power of speech by words t' express his grief  Nature permits not some believe the source  Of anguish and affliction is conceal'd  From every eye and deem assistance vain  Or to the Nurse or vaunting Midwife trust  Who cases manifold and similar  Have oft beheld and never fail'd to cure  For Each her Nostrum boasts if harmless this  And trifling it were well did not the wing  Of Time speed fast th' irrevocable hour  Of wisht redress But frequently the drug  They praise the cordial drops are fraught with death  Hurrying convulsions on of direst kind  Or with narcotic venom strong imbued  Plunging their Patient in eternal sleep  YET Nature in thy Child tho not in words  Speaks plain to those who in her language verst  Justly interpret Are the different tones  Of woe unfaithful sounds Can He whose sight  Hath traced the various muscles in their course  When irritated in the different limbs  Retracted or extended or supine  Fix no conclusions on the seat of pain  Is it of no avail to mark the breath  How drawn the face the motions of the eye  The salient pulse th' eruptions on the skin  The skin itself constricted or relaxt  The mode of sleep of watching heat and thirst  From which and numerous traits beside arranged  Combined abstracted and maturely weigh'd  Judgment it's practice forms Are characters  Like these which ask the nicedecyphering soul  Intelligible to the Beldames Old  Who wrapt in darkness utter prophesies  And lying oracles which cheat the ear  Or follow'd to destruction lead the way  Oh may good Angels kindling in thy breast  The lamp of reason guard thee from their snares  Blind Guides assiduous to deceive the Blind  TRUTHS partially adopted oft admit  Ingressive Error Children are presumed  As fresh from Nature's hand with maladies  Of simpler kind to labour than the frame  Of grosser Age Say this belief were true  A general rule If simpler than they are  Hence treated still we cannot but decry  Th' unsound opinion which for all alike  One favourite mode of practice recommends  If just the notion Aesculapius' Son  Might as a vain intruder be dismiss'd  The Mother could supply his place unblamed  But nor with idle terrors do we seek  To wound affection from experience taught  We know what medicines different in effect  And opposite the varying symptoms claim  Antiphlogistics which the vital heat  Increased depress and Cardiacs which excite  And Opiate Sedatives in vulgar hands  Pernicious as the deadly nightshade's juice  And Drastics harsh which utmost skill alone  And wise discretion when the moment calls  Should dare advise Th' uncomprehensive Mind  Or prejudiced or wishing to repose  In inactivity is likewise prone  To simplify the causes and accuse  That which perhaps exists not but which reigns  As it conjectures eminent o'er all  THE wild delusions which this source affords  With silent scorn or pity hath the Muse  Often attested The luxuriant glands  In Infants stiled of disproportion'd size  And the too copious fluids they secern  Or tough and viscid Some alone condemn  As if these glands by nature were ordain'd  So large without design or worse to prove  The cisterns of disease Acidity  Some only blame and some the sting severe  Of acrimonious humours These accuse  The noisome worm however hid from fight  Those as exciting fever reprobate  Nought but the growing teeth Repletion Some  While Others dreadful fits survey within  Or e'en pretend to trace them in the smile  Of downy sleep Nor Women solely err  The Pedant has his whims and He the light  Fantastic Form who superficial skims  The froth of science yet would fain appear  Most intimate in it's profoundest depths  Nor a phaenomenon beholds to which  Like the first Man intuitively wise  He cannot give a name What strange conceits  Have not Philosophers embraced Intent  The principles of Galen to defend  Or to deduce from chymic elements  Recondite causes Or the line apply  And mathematic rule to buildings raised  On mere imaginary ground Or search  The moon and aspects of the distant stars  While Some from animated Beings thick  Diffused thro space invisibly minute  Have every ill derived tormenting Man  LET All who will enjoy their pleasing dreams  So human life be safe and Theory  Held in firm durance never guide the pen  When sickness needs assistance But of this  Be sure O Parent to thy Children flow  From numerous causes which would tire thy ear  And pass the stated limits of our verse  Their diverse ails tho not perhaps like Us  Subject to putrid ferments yet from them  Not wholly free nor from the power of cold  Of sultry heat of humid air and dry  And fell Contagion whose resistless aim  If placed within it's reach no Wight can shun  Of mortal mould nor e'er escape the bane  Unless around her favourites Nature cast  Impenetrable mail no work of art  SHALL then by fear impeded None attempt  To rescue Childhood from distress and pain  But those by long and toilsome study taught  T' investigate the cause the symptoms scan  And judge what they portend Th' impartial heart  Unmoved by sordid lucre by the goad  Of mean selfinterest wishes to the Race  Of Infant Innocence no worse a fate  But not to combat what the Muses Nine  And e'en the Delian God with all his power  Could never vanquish and because the step  Of Paeon's Votary is not always near  Attend our strains When the weak head declines  And the eye droops when now th' inconstant cheek  Is red now pale when fretful restless hot  The stomach and intestines discomposed  And in their office changed when the young springs  Of life more quick or tardy seem to move  Than Nature wills We would not to thy Child  Forbid thee tho We dare not recommend  Nor can approve the deed unless by fate  Widely sequester'd from th' experienced eye  Reason's sole plea to give a portion due  Of th' Indian root or taught the quantity  With nice exactness which his Age may claim  Some useful Antimonial or that mild  Insipid light absorbent by it's name  Magnesia better known or join'd with this  More strengthening Rhéum from Siberian wilds  Or Turkey's regions brought Here ends thy care  For now the transient obstacles o'ercome  Alacrity returns or still He pines  Still his distemper gains increasing force  And if the cause should thus be deeply fixt  Thy efforts would be vain perhaps unsafe  At least engend'ring danger by delay  And Danger often marches close by Death  HERE let thy love thy conscience take th' alarm  Love for thy Child and terror at the guilt  Of dire infanticide Perhaps the worst  Of ills impends Convulsion lurks unseen  Fever already riots in his veins  Or suffocation threatens to destroy  Trust not Thyself trust not the babbling Hag  Let Fondness all alive and light'ning round  Detect Her as Ithuriel's spear the toad  Couch'd at the ear of Eve with poison fill'd  YET shun despondence cherish warmest hope  Seize fleet occasion ere it passes by  And call th' ingenious Leach his happy skill  Shall to it's pristine health thy Babe restore  If allo'erruling Providence permit  If not to th' indefatigable Mind  Tho learning all it's mysteries hath reveal'd  Tho judgment clear and long experience join  Their potent aid A WARREN will be foil'd  A HEBERDEN or BAKER cannot save  But Thou from every taint of guilt or blame  Art free thy duty is perform'd tho poor  That solace is which counsels Be resign'd  Fetter the strong sensations rapidwing'd  And glean content from rectitude of thought  Who thus can lose the Darling of the eye  The little lively Cherub who e'en now  Begins his voice to modulate and lisp  The halfform'd tale Ah wherefore was he given  So soon resumed and snatch'd from cheerful day  That Heaven best knows Yet if thou wilt indulge  Thy just emotions give them ample scope  Recall each mimic gesture every sound  Each look when pleased or wayward in his mood  He struck with inexpressive tenderness  The soul parental With thy struggling heart  The Muse shall sympathise shall add to thine  Congenial notes sincere But time shall heal  The rankling wound and soften by degrees  Nay quite o'ercome reflection's sharpest pangs  Till Memory tracing to the fount of Grief  Views it at length unruffled and beholds  Thro the calm lymph Woe's once detested form  Affectionately pensive yet serene  THE Human Soul with fortitude can bear  Or with elastic energy expell  Or slowly certain vanquish every ill  But dread remorse The Selfaccused descend  Low in the scale and abject or they pine  Afflicted or amid the blaze of noon  Perceive no change in the dark midnight gloom  Which reigns within Despair stands scouling by  And sullen Madness crouches for his prey  OH may thy Mind whatever doom'd to feel  Whate'er of anguish pain or penury  Wounds of ingratitude or slighted love  This worse than all that famine fire or steel  This horrid Fiend avoiding never shrink  Beneath his weight by conscious thought condemn'd  Nor may Evadne's melancholy fate  Be ever thine What beauties could She boast  How fair in virgin innocence Her charms  Pierced deep for unaffected was the Maid  And justest education had improved  Not tortured Nature Melody had chose  Her voice for it's loved vehicle of sound  Tho mute She spake her eye had magic fire  Her shape her gesture every action beam'd  Expressive elegance Could the young heart  Of Polydore resist her wondrous power  He strove not to resist He heard He saw  And all his melting soul was Her's alone  Nor did She view th' enamour'd Swain or hear  Scornful the tender vows He breathed for his  Was the smooth open front of candid truth  The modest cheek the soft persuasive glance  Of true affection and the sigh sincere  The lawns the meads beheld them and the groves  Of quivering alder and the willows green  Skirting the mazy brook nor e'er beheld  Happier and purer Mortals nor e'er caught  Amid their shades or on their mossy banks  Notes more impassion'd from the Doric Muse  Than Polydore to his Evadne sung  THUS fixt immutably thus rivetted  By strong attraction not a Father's frown  For his imagination had pourtray'd  Evadne in the higher rank of pride  Of wealth and pageantry not five long years  Of absence could from either's heart erase  The other's image Yet again They met  Auspicious was the meeting for the soul  Of Age severe now moved resolved to bless  The constant Youth and to his arms resign  The beauteous Maid He bless'd the constant Youth  And to his arms the beauteous Maid resign'd  Fair shone the morn of their espousals fair  The coming morn and promised to the eye  Of raptured love a train of prosperous days  OH Happiness how exquisitehow brief  Affliction is the lot of Man below  And often Misery when the soul of joy  Flushes with transport breathes a sudden air  Of chilling frost the genial warmth destroys  And florid bloom One eve Evadne sat  Alone in swift succession to her view  Rose many a fairy prospect but the light  Which gilded them was Polydore's the sun  Was He illuming animating all  The forms of her creation Even then  She felt his warm embrace and press'd She thought  His glowing cheek to her's for him prepared  The table smiled for him brightbeaming shone  The rosy wine the footsteps of his steed  She heard in every gale But him alas  The living Polydore she never saw  That Steed had proved unfaithful to his trust  With mad'ning swiftness t'ward the gate He flew  While far behind his breathless Master lay  THE feelings of Evadne to describe  Weak is the Muse and nerveless are her strains  What can support her Where exists the Power  Which can detain her from the grave that holds  Her Lord in death What but the Babe which smiles  Unconscious of his loss as on her breast  Her nurturing breast He hangs For him She lives  For him sustains the load of grief and strives  To tear the rooted anguish from her mind  He is the charm which reconciles her thoughts  To the loath'd world for Polydore in him  She sees in the dear pledge of amity  Stampt with his image with his vital blood  Inform'd and breathing sweet his balmy breath  HATH not Misfortune spent her deadly shafts  Illstarr'd Evadne In thy Child appear  The symptoms of disease and onward hastes  Impetuous Fever To a form like thine  A temper blameless with emotions pure  Humane and amiable ah why did Heaven  Refuse staid Judgment firmness to resist  Error importunate and strength to shun  Credulity which hears the Dotard's tale  And thinks it truth Who taught thy Grandam hoar  The secrets of an art to which the Mind  Of vigorous energy and years of toil  Are scarcely equal By what Demon urged  Malicious with what evil Spirit fill'd  Of selfconceit and folly dares She hope  T' accomplish what requires the searching eye  Of Genius and the labour'd skill of deep  And accurate attention On thy Child  She looks then proves her wisdom First the teeth  Are blamed and charms are tried and Nostrums given  Next Fits internal and her poisonous drugs  She brews like Circe Then the noxious Worm  And Anthelmintics various She procures  And oft repeats the drench Each different cause  She e'er has heard suggested is accused  And every remedy She ever knew  Administer'd while still the last her voice  Solemnly slow declares will banish pain  And with miraculous and sudden force  Restore the suffering Babe who lies meantime  Opprest with double woe by his disease  And that pernicious treatment which from plain  And simple has converted it at length  To mortal violence Now Nature yields  Reluctantly o'ercome Evadne sees  The Victim of presumptuous Ignorance  Conviction flashes on her mind She calls  For aid too late He dies and with him dies  Her Polydore again She raves She tears  Her flowing locks Yet passionate excess  May waste itself and Peace once more return  It might return as when She felt the pangs  Of absent love as when her heart was torn  Losing it's dearer portion But the sting  Of sharp reflection by Herself impell'd  What hand shall e'er extract Her delicate  And feeling mind imaginationstruck  Shrinks from existence while by day by night  These sounds pervade her ear "Thy Child is slain  And Thou wert an Accomplice" Horrid sounds  Inviting on his cloud the dreary Shape  Of melancholy Madness Oh what notes  What different notes utters Evadne now  Enfrenzied and forlorn from those which erst  Amid their shades or on their mossy banks  The groves responsive heard the joyous groves  Of quivering alder and the willows green  Skirting the mazy brook those Doric notes  Which Polydore to his Evadne sung  TURN We from scenes like these which o'er the soul  Of weeping Sympathy diffuse a gloom  Yet not unchasten'd by the milder ray  Of selfacquitting thought and firm intent  To shun the latent rocks of deep distress  By pious caution guided from our theme  Not thus abstracted it's preceptive notes  Yet unrelinquishing and sorrows mists  Dispell'd which o'er the breast of Innocence  Flit like a cloud across the summer sky  To happier mansions objects of delight  And joyful prospects turn to where thy Child  Hath by Inoculation overcome  The Plague Variolous As Hercules  The spotted Snakes defeating transport flush'd  Alcmena's glowing cheek so over thine  I see the kindled radiance Whether born  In Ethiopic wilds or mid the sands  Of parch'd Arabia or where spread the shores  Girding the Caspian from his natal place  Pursuing Mahomet's widewasting arms  The Monster rush'd on Europe pale dismay  Horror and Death rapacious in his train  For many a Century without controul  When ragid his fury by pernicious skies  Aroused or propagated far and wide  By fell Contagion He destroy'd Mankind  The Cities groan'd The Matron o'er her Babe  In unavailing trance of anguish hung  The Lover offer'd up his fruitless vows  And wearied Heaven importunately fond  To save the Beauty which his soul adored  The Babe the Mother's self became his prey  The Youth and Virgin sunk into the tomb  If life were granted beauty was effaced  Each decent feature tumid and enlarged  Roughen'd or dented with unseemly scars  MEDICINE was whelm'd with shame the Roman page  Was silent nor the Grecian could afford  An antidote for evils Grecia's Sons  Had ne'er imagined Rhazes wrote in vain  And even Sydenham's efforts had their bounds  For the cold lymph by Prejudice was shunn'd  And Sydenham tho He oft by freer air  Tamed the devouring heat and shook the throne  Of learned Ignorance declaring war  Against it's regimen adverse to life  And compounds teeming with destructive fire  Alexipharmic poisons could not change  The rank malignant nature of the Pest  Which still when favouring constitutions reign'd  And in peculiar Habits all his art  Baffled invincible his art beyond  All Mortals else and only not divine  THE triumph was reserved for Female hands  Thine was the deed accomplish'd MONTAGUE  What Physic ne'er conjectured What described  By Pylarini by Timoni sketch'd  Seem'd to Philosophy an idle tale  Or curious only She by patriot love  Inspired and England rising to her view  Proved as a truth and proved it on her Son  A manly Mind where reason dwelt supreme  Was Her's the little terrors of her sex  Despising by maternal fondness sway'd  Yet bold where confidence had stable grounds  How far superior to the turbann'd Race  With whom She sojourn'd scrupulous and weak  YET this is She whom Pope's illiberal verse  Hath dared to censure with malicious spleen  And meanlycoward soul Redoubled Bard  What hath thy satire tho it often flow  Happy and poignant with Horatian ease  What hath thy moral lay tho pure and just  And elegant of profit e'er produced  Of high advantage to thy natal Land  Compared with her bequest Thy numbers charm  The listening ear and with thy polisht stile  Taste is enamour'd She hath been the cause  Of heartfelt joy to thousands thousands live  And still shall live thro her thy song can please  None but the Sons of Britain or the Few  Of nice and studious leisure She unlock'd  The springs of satisfaction and delight  And with perennial comfort bless'd the World  LET Me then urge this duty nor to fear  Or superstition yielding let thy Child  Encounter in his native shape the Fiend  And brave his violence For whither say  To what sequester'd haunt canst Thou retreat  Where He will not pursue How vain thy flight  How sure thy victory if as Art direct  And wise Experience thou anticipate  His threaten'd blow So when the Patriarch's arm  Was stretch'd to wound his Son An Angel came  And saved the victim from impending death  GENTLE and almost harmless is the bane  By Skill communicated which regards  The times and seasons nor infects the Child  If to Dentition's wonted state arrived  For ill the labouring frame can then endure  An added stimulus Nor yet before  That period lest to Epilepsy prone  By the contagious vapour raised He quit  Sudden the precincts warm of light and life  This too the cold of winter bids Us shun  Potent the vessels to contract increase  Their tonic force and in the system stir  Fierce inflammation And the summer heat  By which all putrid ferments are sublimed  And render'd doubly fatal These extremes  Avoided in the temperate months alone  Let every prudent Matron be resolved  T' obey the call of duty and of love  Unless the dread contagion thickening round  Impell them to neglect each guarded rule  Yielding by force to peril's just alarm  NEED We in this our Aera when mature  And vigorous reason prospers groundless fears  Oppose by arguments the groundless fears  Of fondness or religion In thy mind  No terror should or can with justice dwell  But lest as naturally seen by Art  Unmodified uncheck'd the stern Disease  Should thy young Charge assault If He escape  His lot is fortunate Assaulted thus  Oft from an Hundred only many die  From many Hundreds None or one perchance  Of those inoculated Why should thine  Be the poor solitary One If death  Follow a treatment which can soothe the Pest  And meliorate it's nature could his life  Be granted to thy fervent prayer when arm'd  And with it's proper rage it took the field  This be thy source of comfort Nor believe  That Providence is tempted by the deed  From Providence flows reason to Mankind  And Reason teaches Us to fly from ill  And covet good Th' invention the success  Is the true warrant of approving Heaven  Who would not rather cross a shallow frith  When first the rising tide begins than wait  Hemm'd in a nook till with impetuous force  It sweep Him from his station Who refuse  By Franklin's pointed rod to draw the stream  Of lightning on their roofs because the cloud  Might harmless pass above thus safe convey'd  In unterrific silence to the ground  THO rare th' Examples now and scatter'd mark  Th' unhappy Beings who from idle dread  Or weak maternal love in Childhood's state  This boon received not and who sharing yet  Th' hereditary feelings want themselves  Firmness of soul th' omission to supply  Mark where they pine in solitude oppresst  By anxious thought to whom Man's cheerful Race  Affords no joy the voice of Music breathes  It's choral notes unheard the stage displays  The living manners and th' assembly beams  With sprightliness and elegance in vain  The City nay the Village bounds they fly  And shift from place to place as from the pack  Of clamorous Hounds and Men in wild affright  The trembling Hare Oh never may thy Sons  Thy Daughters thus be cursed in early life  By thee from all these future horrors freed  The mirthful croud with innocence of heart  Joining wellpleased the gay the social hour  Nor shunning nor desiring but awhile  To soften care or fit the soul for acts  By relaxation due of nobler kind  Endow'd by Thee with comeliness no trace  Of this abhorr'd Distemper left behind  And all it's wonted ravages

south to where the towers ascend  Of famed Petropolis Or crossing wide  Th' Atlantic foam why in the newfound World  Which more to Her than it's Discoverer owes  Appears no structure sacred to her praise  Yet shall Imagination rear the dome  And fix th' expressive marble Hither come  Ye Nymphs and Swains with flowery garlands deck'd  Your polisht foreheads on the shaven green  Which fronts the Temple ply your nimble feet  The jocund dance inweaving Hither come  Ye Fauns and Dryads Hither glowing Love  And spotless Beauty Youth with radiant eye  And blooming Health While underneath the beech  Or oak which waves it's consecrated shade  Humanity and Wisdom smiling view  The festive Throng mid whom the Graces play  And quitting their proud bowers and lofty hill  The Muses utter notes divinely sweet  Such as of yore They sung when Gratitude  Tuned to the Friends and Patrons of mankind  The genuine lyre ennobled by it's theme  FINIS
