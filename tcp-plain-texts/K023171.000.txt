 ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT  ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT  A DIALOGUE Something like  HORACE  By Mr  POPE  LONDON  Printed for T COOPER at the  Globe  in  Paternosterrow  Price One Shilling  ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT  DIALOGUE  A  _NOT twice a twelvemonth you appear in Print  And when it comes the Court see nothing in't  You grow  correct  that once with Rapture writ  And are besides too  Moral  for a Wit  Decay of Parts alas we all must feel  Why now this moment don't I see you steal  'Tis all from  Horace  did not  Horace  say  "Lord  Fanny  spun a thousand lines a day  And long before you in much better metre  "Laugh at those Fools who put their trust in  Peter  But  Horace  Sir was delicate was nice  Bubo  observes he lash'd no sort of  Vice  Horace  would say  Sir  Billy  serv'd the Crown  Blunt  could do Bus'ness  Hggins  knew the Town  Sir  George  of  some slight Gallantries  suspect  In rev'rend  Sn  note a  small Neglect  And own the  Spaniard  did a  waggish thing  Who cropt our Ears and sent them to the King  His sly polite insinuating stile  Could please at Court and made AUGUSTUS smile  An artful Manager that crept between  His Friends and Shame and was a kind of  Screen  Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico  Tangit admissus circum praecordia ludit  But 'faith your very Friends will soon be sore  Patriots  there are who wish you'd jest no more  And where's the Glory 'twill be only thought  The Great man never offer'd you a Groat  Go see Sir ROBERT  B  See Sir ROBERThum  And never laughfor all my life to come  Seen him I have but in his happier hour  Of Social Pleasure illexchang'd for Pow'r  Would he oblige me let me only find  He thinks one Poet of no venal kind  Come come at all I laugh He laughs no doubt  The only diff'rence is I dare laugh out  A  Why yes with  Scripture  still you may be free  A Horselaugh if you please at  Honesty  A Joke on JEKYL or some odd  Old Whig  Who never chang'd his Principle or Wig  A Patriot is a Fool in ev'ry age  Whom all Lord Chamberlains allow the Stage  These nothing hurts they keep their Fashion still  And wear their strange old Virtue as they will  If any ask you "Who's the Man so near  "His Prince that writes in Verse and has his Ear  Why answer LYTTELTON and I'll engage  The worthy Youth shall ne'er be in a rage  But were his Verses vile his Whisper base  You'd quickly find him in Lord  Fanny  's case  Aegysthus Verres  hurt not honest FLEURY  But well may put some Statesmen in a fury  Laugh then at any but at Fools or Foes  These you but anger and you mend not those  Laugh at your Friends and if your Friends are sore  So much the better you may laugh the more  To Vice and Folly to confine the jest  Sets half the World God knows against the rest  Did not the Sneer of more impartial men  At Sense and Virtue balance all agen  Judicious Wits spread wide the Ridicule  And charitably comfort Knave and Fool  B  Dear Sir forgive the Prejudice of Youth  Adieu Distinction Satire Warmth and Truth  Come harmless  Characters  that no one hit  Come  Henley  's Oratory  Osborn  's Wit  The Honey dropping from  Tyl  's tongue  The Flow'rs of  Bubton  the Flow of  Yng  The gracious Dew of Pulpit Eloquence  And all the wellwhipt Cream of Courtly Sense  That first was  Hvy  's  F  's next and then  The Ste's and then  Hvy  's once agen  O come that easy  Ciceronian  stile  So  Latin  yet so  English  all the while  As tho' the Pride of  Middleton  and  Bland  All Boys may read and Girls may understand  Then might I sing without the least Offence  And all I sung should be the  Nation  's  Sense  SoSatire is no moreI feel it die  No  Gazeteer  more innocent than I  And let a God'sname ev'ry Fool and Knave  Be grac'd thro' Life and flatter'd in his Grave  A  Why so if Satire know its Time and Place  You still may lash the Greatestin Disgrace  For Merit will by turns forsake them all  Would you know when exactly when they fall  But let all Satire in all Changes spare  Immortal  Sk  and grave  Dere  Silent and soft as Saints remove to Heav'n  All Tyes dissolv'd and ev'ry Sin forgiv'n  These may some gentle ministerial Wing  Receive and place for ever near a King  There where no Passion Pride or Shame transport  Lull'd with the sweet  Nepenthe  of a Court  There where no Father's Brother's Friend's Disgrace  Once break their Rest or stir them from their Place  But past the Sense of human Miseries  All Tears are wip'd for ever from all Eyes  No Cheek is known to blush no Heart to throb  Save when they lose a Question or a Job  B  Good Heav'n forbid that I shou'd blast their Glory  Who know how like WhigMinisters to Tory  And when three Sov'reigns dy'd could scarce be vext  Consid'ring what a Gracious Prince was next  Have I in silent wonder seen such things  As Pride in Slaves and Avarice in Kings  And at a Peer or Peeress shall I fret  Who starves a Mother or forswears a Debt  Virtue  I grant you is an empty boast  But shall the Dignity of  Vice  be lost  Ye Gods shall  Cibber  's Son without rebuke  Swear like a Lord or  Rich  outwhore a Duke  A Fav'rite's  Porter  with his Master vie  Be brib'd as often and as often lie  Is it for  Wrd  or  Peter  paltry Things  To pay their Debts or keep their Faith like Kings  If  Author of a Book intitled The Oracles of Re  on  Blount  destroy'd himself he play'd the man  And so may'st Thou Illustrious  Passeran  But shall a  Printer  weary of his life  Learn from their Books to hang himself and Wife  This this my friend I cannot will not bear  Vice thus abus'd demands a Nation's care  This calls the Church to deprecate our Sin  And hurls the Thunder of the Laws on  Gin  Let humble  Foster  if he will excell  Ten Metropolitans in preaching well  A simple Quaker or a Quaker's Wife  Outdo  Ldffe  in Doctrineyea in Life  Let lowborn ALLEN with an aukward Shame  Do good by stealth and blush to find it Fame  Virtue  may chuse the high or low Degree  'Tis just alike to Virtue and to me  Dwell in a Monk or light upon a King  She's still the same belov'd contented thing  Vice  is undone if she forgets her Birth  And stoops from Angels to the Dregs of Earth  But 'tis the  Fall  degrades her to a Whore  Let  Greatness  own her and she's mean no more  Her Birth her Beauty Crowds and Courts confess  Chaste Matrons praise her and grave Bishops bless  In golden Chains the willing World she draws  And hers the Gospel is and hers the Laws  Mounts the Tribunal lifts her scarlet head  And sees pale Virtue carted in her stead  Lo at the Wheels of her Triumphal Car  Old  England  's Genius rough with many a Scar  Dragg'd in the Dust his Arms hang idly round  His Flag inverted trails along the ground  Our Youth all liv'ry'd o'er with foreign Gold  Before her dance behind her crawl the Old  See thronging Millions to the Pagod run  And offer Country Parent Wife or Son  Hear her black Trumpet thro' the Land proclaim  That "Not to be corrupted is the Shame"  In Soldier Churchman Patriot Man in Pow'r  'Tis Av'rice all Ambition is no more  See all our Nobles begging to be Slaves  See all our Fools aspiring to be Knaves  The Wit of Cheats the Courage of a Whore  Are what ten thousand envy and adore  All all look up with reverential Awe  On Crimes that scape or triumph o'er the Law  While Truth Worth Wisdom daily we decry  "Nothing is Sacred now but Villany"  Yet may this Verse if such a Verse remain  Show there was one who held it in disdain  FINIS  BOOKS lately Printed for T COOPER  The
