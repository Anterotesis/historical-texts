 AN APPEAL TO  Honour  and  Justice  Tho' it be of His Worst ENEMIES  By DANIEL DE FOE  BEING A True Account of his Conduct in Publick Affairs  JEREM xviii  Come and let us smite him with the  Tongue  and let us not give heed to any of his Words  LONDON  Printed for J BAKER at the  Black Boy  in  PaterNosterRow    AN APPEAL TO  Honour  and  Justice  c  I Hope the Time is come at last when the Voice of moderate Principles may be heard hitherto the Noise has been so great and the Prejudices and Passions of Men so strong that it had been but in vain to offer at any Argument or for any Man to talk of giving a Reason for his Actions And this alone has been the Cause why when other Men who I think have less to say in thier own Defence are appealing to the Publick and struggling to defend themselves I alone have been silent under the infinite Clamours and Reproaches causeless Curses unusual Threatnings and the most unjust and injurious Treatment in the World  I hear much of Peoples calling out to punish the Guilty but very few are concern'd to clear the Innocent I hope some will be inclin'd to Judge impartially and have yet reserv'd so much of the Christian as to believe and at least to hope that a rational Creature cannot abandon himself so as to act without some Reason and are willing not only to have me defend my self but to be able to answer for me where they hear me causlesly insulted by others and therefore are willing to have such just Arguments put into their Mouths as the Cause will bear  As for those who are prepossess'd and ac  ding to the modern Justice of Parties are  to be so  Let them go  I am not  them  but against them  they act so  to Justice to Reason to Religion  to the Rules of Christians and of  Manners that they are not to be argued  but to be expos'd or entirely neglected  a Receipt against all the Uneasiness which it may be supposed to give me and that is to contemn Slander and think it not worth the least Concern neither should I think it worth while to give any Answer to  if it were not on some other Accounts of which I shall speak as I go on  If any  ask me why I am in such hast to publish this Matter at this time Among man  other good Reasons which I could give these are some  I think I have long enough been made  Fabula Vulgi  and born the Weight of general  Slander and I should be wanting to Truth to my Family and to my Self if I did not give a fair and true State of my Conduct for impartial Men to judge of when I am no more in being to answer for my self  By the Hints of Mortality and by the Infirmities of a Life of Sorrow and Fatigue I have Reason to think that I am not a great way off from if not very near to the great Ocean of Eternity and the time may not be long e're I embark on the last Voyage Wherefore I think I should  even Accounts  with this World before I go that no Actions Slanders may lie against my Heirs Executors Administrators and Assigns to disturb them in the peaceable Possession of their Father's Character Inheritance  I fear  God grant I have not a second Sight in it  that this lucid Interval of Temper and Moderation which shines  tho' dimly too  upon us at this time will be but of short Continuance and that some Men who know not how to use the Advantage God has put into their Hands with Moderation will p  sh in spight of the best Prince in the World at such extravagant Things and act with such an intemperate Forwardness as will revive the Heats and Animosities which wise and good Men were in hopes should be allay'd by the happy Accession of the King to the Throne  It is and ever was my Opinion that Moderation is the only Vertue by which the Peace  and Tranquillity of this Nation can be preserv'd even the King himself  I believe his Majesty will allow me that Freedom  can only be happy in the Enjoyment of the Crown by a moderate Administration if his Majesty should be oblig'd contrary to his known Disposition to joyn with intemperate Councils if it does not lessen his Security I am perswaded it will lessen his Satisfaction It cannot be pleasant or agreeable and  I think  it cannot be safe to any just Prince to Rule over a divided People split into incens'd and exasperated Parties Tho' a skilful Mariner may have Courage to master a Tempest and goes fearless thro' a Storm yet he can never be said to delight in the Danger a fresh fair Gale and a quiet Sea is the Pleasure of his Voyage and we have a Saying worth Notice to them that are otherwise minded  Qui amat periculum periibat in Illo  To attain at the happy Calm which as I say is the Safety of  Britain  is the Question which should now move us all and he would Merit to be call'd the Nation's Physician that could prescribe the Specifick for it I think I may be allow'd to say a  Conquest of Parties  will never do it  a Ballance of Parties MAY  Some are for  the former  they talk high of Punishments letting Blood revenging the Treatment they have met with and the like If they  not knowing what Spirit they are of  think this the Course to be taken let them try their Hands I shall give them for lost and look for their Downfal  from that time  for the Ruin of all such Tempers slumbereth not  It is many Years that I have profess'd my self an Enemy to all Precipitations in publick Administrations and often I have attempted to shew that hot Councils have ever been distructive to those who have made use of them Indeed they have not always been a Disadvantage to the Nation as in King  James  II's Reign where as I have often said in Print his Precipitation was the Safety of us all and if he had proceeded temperately and politickly we had been undone  Faelix quem faciunt  But these things have been spoken when your Ferment has been too high for any thing to be heard whether you will hear it now or not  I know not  and therefore it was that I said  I fear  the present Cessation of PartyArms will not hold long  These are some of the Reasons why I think this is the proper Juncture for me to give some Account of my self and of my past Conduct to the World and that I may do this as effectually as I can being perhaps never more to speak from the Press I shall as concisely as I can give an Abridgment of my own History during the few unhappy Years I have employ'd my self or been employ'd in Publick in the World  Misfortunes in Business having unhing'd me from Matters of Trade it was about the Year when I was invited by some Merchants with whom I had corresponded abroad and some also at home to settle at  Cadiz  in  Spain  and that with Offers of very good Commissions but Providence which had other Work for me to do placed a secret Aversion in my Mind to  quitting  England  upon any account and made me refuse the best Offers of that kind to be concern'd with some eminent Persons at home in proposing  Ways  and  Means  to the Government for raising Money to supply the Occasions of the War then newly begun Some time after this I was without the least Application of mine and being then seventy Miles from  London  sent for to be Accomptant to the Commissioners of the Glass Duty in which Service I continued to the Determination of their Commission  During this time there came out a vile abhor'd Pamphlet in very ill Verse written by one Mr  Tutchin  and call'd THE FOREIGNERS In which the Author  who he was I then knew not  fell personally upon the King himself and then upon the  Dutch  Nation and after having reproach'd his Majesty with Crimes that his worst Enemy could not think of without Horror he sums up all in the odious Name of FOREIGNER  This fill'd me with a kind of Rage against the Book and gave birth to a Trifle which I never could hope should have met with so general an Acceptation as it did I mean  The TrueBornEnglishman  How this Poem was the Occasion of my being known to his Majesty how I was afterwards receiv'd by him how Employ'd and how above my Capacity of deserving Rewarded is no Part of the present Case and is only mention'd here as I take all Occasions to do for the expressing the Honour I ever preserv'd for the Immortal and Glorious Memory of that Greatest and Best of Princes  and who it was my Honour and Advantage to call Master as well as Sovereign whose Goodness to me I never forgot neither can forget and whose Memory I never patiently heard abused nor ever can do so and who had he liv'd would never have suffered me to be treated as I have been in the World  But Heaven for our Sins remov'd him in Judgment How far the Treatment he met with from the Nation he came to save and whose Deliverance he finished was admitted by Heaven to be a Means of his Death I desire to forget for their sakes who are guilty and if this calls any of it to mind it is mention'd to move them to treat him better who is now with like Principles of Goodness and Clemency appointed by God and the Constitution to be their Sovereign least he that protects righteous Princes avenges the Injuries they receive from an ungrateful People by giving them up to the Confusions their Madness leads them to  And in their just acclamations at the happy accession of His present Majesty to the Throne I cannot but advise them to look back and call to mind who it was that first Guided them to the Family of  Hanover  and to pass by all the Popish Branches of  Orleans  and  Savoy  recognizing the just authority of Parliament in the undoubted Right of Limiting the Succession and Establishing that Glorious Maxim of our Settlement  viz  That  it is inconsistent with the Constitution of this Protestant Kingdom to be Govern'd by a Popish Prince  I say let them cell to mind who it was that guided  their Thoughts first to the Protestant Race of our own Kings in the House of  Hanover  and that it is to King  William  next to Heaven it self to whom we owe the Enjoying a Protestant King at this time I need not go back to the particulars of his Majesty's Conduct in that Affair his Journey in Person to the Country of  Hanover  and the Court of  Zell  his particular management of the Affair afterwards at home perfecting the Design by naming the Illustrious Family to the Nation and bringing about a Parliamentary Settlement to effect it entailing thereby the Crown in so effectual a manner as we see has been sufficient to prevent the worst Designs of our  Jacobite  People in behalf of the Pretender a Settlement together with the subsequent Acts which followed it and the Union with  Scotland  which made it unalterable that gave a compleat Satisfaction to those who knew and understood it and removed those terrible apprehensions of the Pretender which some entertain'd from the minds of others who were yet as zealous against him as it was possible for any to be Upon this Settlement as  I shall shew presently  I grounded my Opinion  which I often express'd viz  that I did not see it possible the Jacobites could ever set up their Idol here and I think my Opinion abundantly justify'd in the Consequences of which by and by  This Digression as a debt to the Glorious Memory of King  William  I could not in Justice omit and as the Reign of his present Majesty is esteem'd Happy and look'd upon  as a Blessing from Heaven by us it will most necessarily lead us to bless the Memory of King  William  to whom we owe so much of it How easily could his Majesty have led us to other Branches whose Relation to the Crown might have had large pretences What Prince but would have submitted to have Educated a Successor of their Race in the Protestant Religion for the sake of such a Crown But the King who had our Happiness in View and saw as far into it as any humane sight could Penetrate who knew we were not to be Govern'd by unexperienc'd Youths that the Protestant Religion was not to be Establish'd by Political Converts and that Princes under  French  Influence or Instructed in  French  Politicks were not proper Instruments to preserve the Liberties of  Britain  fixt his Eyes upon the Family who now possesses the Crown as not only having an undoubted Relation to it by Blood but as being first and principally Zealous and Powerful assertors of the Protestant Religion and Interest against Popery And  Secondly  stored with a visible Succession of worthy and promising Branches who appear'd equal to the Weight of Government quallified to fill a Throne and guide a Nation which without Reflection are not famed to be the most easy to Rule in the World  Whether the Consequence has been a Credit to King  William  's Judgment I need not say I am not Writing Panegyricks here but doing justice to the Memory of the King my Master who I have had the Honour very often to hear express himself with great satisfaction  in having brought the Settlement of the Succession to so good an Issue and to repeat his Majesty's own Words  That he knew no Prince in  Europe  so fit to be King of  England  as the Elector of  Hanover I am persuaded without any Flattery that if it should not every way answer the Expectations his Majesty had of it the fault will be our own God Grant the King may have more Comfort of his Crown than we suffer'd King  William  to have  The King being Dead and the Queen Proclaim'd the Hot Men of that Side as Hot Men of all Sides do Thinking the Game in their own Hands and all other People under their Feet began to run out into those mad Extreams and precipitate themselves into such Measures as according to the Fate of all intemperate Councils ended in their own Confusions and threw them at last out of the Saddle  The Queen who tho' willing to favour the High Church Party did not thereby design the Ruin of those who she did not Employ was soon alarm'd at their wild Conduct and turn'd them out adhering to the moderate Councils of those who better understood or more faithfully pursued her Majesty's and their Countries Interest  In this Turn fell Sir  Edw Seymour  's Party for so the High Men were then call'd and to this Turn we owe the Converson of several other Great Men who became  Whigs  upon that Occasion which it is known they were not before which Conversion afterwards bega  that unkind Distinction of Old Whig and  Modern Whig which some of the former were with very little Justice pleased to run up afterwards to an Extreme very pernicious to both  But I am gone too far in this Part I return to my own Story In the Interval of these Things and during the Heat of the first Fury of Highslying I fell a Sacrifice for writing against the Rage and Madness of that High Party and in the Service of the Dissenters What Justice I met with and above all what Mercy is too well known to need a Repetition  This Introduction is made that it may bring me to what has been the Foundation of all my further Concern in publick Affairs and will produce a sufficient Reason for my adhering to those whose Obligations upon me were too strong to be resisted even when many things were done by them which I could not approve and for this Reason it is that I think it is necessary to distinguish how far I did or did not adhere to or joyn in or with the Persons or Conduct of the late Government And those who are willing to judge with Impartiality and Charity will see reason to use me the more tenderly in their Thoughts when they weigh the Particulars  I will make no Reflections upon the Treatment I met with from the People I suffer'd for or how I was abandon'd even in my Sufferings at the same time that they acknowledg'd the Service it had been to their Cause but I must mention it to let you know that while I lay friendless and distress'd in the Prison of  Newgate  my Family ruin'd and my self without Hope of Deliverance a Message was brought me from a Person of Honour who till that time I had never had the least Acquaintance with or Knowledge of other than by Fame or by Sight as we know Men of Quality by seeing them on publick Occasions I gave no present Answer to the Person who brought it having not duly weighed the Import of the Message the Message was by Word of Month thus  Pray ask that Gentleman what I can do for him  But in return to this kind and generous Message I immediately took my Pen and Ink and writ the Story of the blind Man in the Gospel who follow'd our Saviour and to whom our Blessed Lord put the Question  What wilt thou that I should do unto thee  Who as if he had made it strange that such a Question should be ask'd or as if he had said  Lord doest thou see that I am blind and yet ask me what thou shalt do for me  My Answer is plain in my Misery  Lord that I may receive my Sight  I needed not to make the Application and from this time altho' I lay four Months in Prison after this and heard no more of it yet from this time as I learn'd afterwards this noble Person made it his Business to have my Case represented to Her Majesty and Methods taken for my Deliverance  I mention this Part because I am no more to forget the Obligation upon me to the Queen than to my first Benefactor  When Her Majesty came to have the Truth of the Case laid before Her I soon felt the Effects of her Royal Goodness and Compassion  And first Her Majesty declar'd That She left all that Matter to a certain Person and did not think he would have used me in such a Manner Perhaps these Words may seem imaginary to some and the speaking them to be of no Value and so they would have been if they had not been follow'd with farther and more convincing Proofs of what they imported which were these That Her Majesty was pleased particularly to enquire into my Circumstances and Family and by my Lord Treasurer  Godolphin  to send a considerable Supply to my Wife and Family and to send me to the Prison Money to pay my Fine and the Expences of my Discharge Whether this be a just Foundation let my Enemies judge  Here is the Foundation on which I built my first Sense of Duty to Her Majesty's Person and the indelible Bond of Gratitude to my first Benefactor  Gratitude and Fidelity are inseparable from an honest Man But to be thus oblig'd by a Stranger by a Man of Quality and Honour and after that by the Sovereign under whose Administration I was suffering let any one put himself in my stead and examine upon what Principles I could ever act against either such a Queen or such a Benefactor and what must my own Heart reproach me with what blushes must have cover'd my Face when I had look'd in and call'd myself ungrateful to him that sav'd me thus from distress  Or  Her that fetch'd me out of the Dungeon and gave my Family Relief Let any Man who knows what Principles  are what Engagements of Honour and Gratitude are make this Case his own and say what I could have done less or more than I have done  I must go on a little with the Detail of the Obligation and then I shall descend to relate what I have done and what I have not done in the Case  Being deliver'd from the Distress I was in Her Majesty who was not satisfy'd to do me Good by a single Act of her Bounty had the Goodness to think of taking me into her Service and I had the Honour to be employ'd in several honourable tho' secret Services by the Interposition of my first Benefactor who then appear'd as a Member in the publick Administration  I had the Happiness to discharge my self in all these Trusts so much to the Satisfaction of those who employ'd me tho' often times with Difficulty and Danger that my Lord Treasurer  Godolphin  whose Memory I have always honour'd was pleas'd to continue his Favour to me and to do me all good Offices with Her Majesty even after an unhappy Breach had separated him from my first Benefactor The Particulars of which may not be improper to relate and as it is not an Injustice to any so I hope it will not be offensive  When upon that fatal Breach the Secretary of State was dismiss'd from the Service I look'd upon my self as lost it being a general Rule in such Cases when a great Officer falls that all who came in by his Interest fall with him And resolving never to abandon  the Fortunes of the Man to whom I ow'd so much of my own I quitted the usual Applications which I had made to my Lord Treasurer  But my generous Benefactor when he understood it frankly told me That I should by no means do so for said he in the most engaging terms My Lord Treasurer will employ you in nothing but what is for the publick Service and agreeable to your own Sentiments of Things And besides it is the Queen you are serving who has been very good to you Pray apply your self as you used to do I shall not take it ill from you in the least  Upon this I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer who receiv'd me with great Freedom and told me smiling  He had not seen me along while  I told his Lordship very frankly the Occasion That the unhappy Breach that had fallen out had made me doubtful whether I should be acceptable to his Lordship That I knew it was usual when great Persons fall that all who were in their Interest fell with them That his Lordship knew the Obligations I was under and that I could not but fear my Interest in his Lordship was lessen'd on that Account  Not at all Mr  De Foe reply'd his Lordship  I always think a Man honest till I find to the contrary  Upon this I attended his Lordship as usual and being resolved to remove all possible Ground of Suspicion that I kept any secret Correspondence I never visited or wrote to or any way corresponded with my principal  Benefactor for above three Years which he so well knew the Reason of and so well approv'd that punctual Behaviour in me that he never took it ill from me at all  In Consequence of this Reception my Lord  Godolphin  had the Goodness not only to introduce me for the second time to her Majesty and to the Honour of kissing her Hand but obtain'd for me the Continuance of an Appointment which Her Majesty had been pleas'd to make me in Consideration of a former special Service I had done and in which I had run as much risque of my Life as a Grenadier upon the Counterscarp and which Appointment however was first obtain'd for me at the Intercession of my said first Benefactor and is all owing to that Intercession and Her Majesty's Bounty Upon this second Introduction Her Majesty was pleased to tell me with a Goodness peculiar to Her self That she had such Satisfaction in my former Services that she had appointed me for another Affair which was something Nice and that my Lord Treasurer should tell me the rest and so I withdrew  The next Day his Lordship having commanded me to attend told me That he must send me to  Scotland  and gave me but three Days to prepare my self Accordingly I went to  Scotland  where neither my Business nor the manner of my discharging it is material to this Tract nor will it be ever any part of my Character that I reveal what should be concealed and yet my Errand was such as  was far from being unfit for a Sovereign to direct or an honest Man to perform and the Service I did on that Occasion as it is not unknown to the greatest Man now in the Nation under the King and the Prince so I dare say his Grace was never displeased with the Part I had in it and I hope will not forget it  These things I mention upon this Account and no other  viz  to state the Obligation I have been in all along to Her Majesty personally and to my first Benefactor principally by which  I say I THINK  I was at least obliged not to act against them even in those things which I might not approve Whether I have acted with them farther than I ought shall be spoken to by it self  Having said thus much of the Obligations lay'd on me and the Persons by whom I have this only to add That I think no Man will say a Subject could be under greater Bonds to his Prince or a private Person to a Minister of State and I shall ever preserve this Principle that an honest Man cannot be ungrateful to his Benefactor  But let no Man run away now with the Notion that I am now intending to plead the Obligation that was upon me from Her Majesty or from any other Person to justify my doing any thing that is not otherwise to be justify'd in it self  Nothing would be more injurious than such a Construction and therefore I capitulate for so much Justice as to explain my self by this Declaration  viz  That I only speak of these  Obligations as binding me to a negative Conduct not to fly in the Face of or concern my self in Disputes with those to whom I was under such Obligations altho' I might not in my Judgment joyn in many things that were done No Obligation could excuse me in calling Evil Good or Good Evil but I am of the Opinion that I might justly think my self oblig'd to defend what I thought was to be defended and to be silent in any thing which I might think was not  If this is a Crime I must plead guilty and give in the History of my Obligation abovemention'd as an Extenuation at least if not a Justification of my Conduct suppose a Man's Father was guilty of several things unlawful and unjustifiable a Man may heartily detest the unjustifiable thing and yet it ought not to be expected that he should expose his Father I think the Case on my side exactly the same Nor can the Duty to a Parent be more strongly obliging than the Obligation laid on me But I must allow the Case on the other side not the same  And this brings me to the Affirmative and to enquire what the Matters of Fact are what I have done or have not done on Account of these Obligations which I have been under  It is a general Suggestion and is affirm'd with such Assurance that they tell me it is in vain to contradict it That I have been employ'd by the Earl of  O  d  late Lord Treasurer in the late Disputes about Publick Affairs to write for him or to put it into their own Particulars have written by his Direction taken the Materials  from him been dictated to or instructed by him or by other Persons from him by his Order and the like and that I have receiv'd a Pension or Sallery or Payment from his Lordship for such Services as these  If I could put it into Words that would more fully express the Meaning of these People I profess I would do it  One would think it was impossible but that since these things have been so confidently affirm'd some Evidence might be produc'd some Facts might appear some one Body or other might be found that could speak of certain Knowledge To say things have been carry'd too closely to be discover'd  is saying nothing  for then they must own  that it is not discover'd  And how then can they affirm it as they do with such an Assurance as nothing ought to be affirm'd by honest Men unless they were able to prove it  To speak then to the Fact Were the Reproach upon  me only  in this Particular I should not mention it I should not think it a Reproach to be directed by a Man to whom the Queen had at that time entrusted the Administration of the Government But as it is a Reproach upon his Lordship Justice requires that I do Right in this Case The Thing is true or false I would recommend it to those who would be call'd honest Men to consider but one Thing  viz  What if it should not be true Can they justify the Injury done to that Person or to any Person concern'd If it cannot be prov'd if no Vestiges appear to ground it upon how can they  charge Men upon Rumours and Reports and joyn to run Men's Characters down by the Stream of Clamour  Sed quo rapit impetus undae  In Answer to the Charge I bear Witness to Posterity that every Part of it is false and forg'd and I do solemnly protest in the  Fear  and  Presence  of him that shall Judge us all both the Slanderers and the Slandered that I have not receiv'd any Instructions Directions Orders  or let them call it what they will of that kind  for the Writing any Part of what I have written or any Materials for the putting together for the Forming any Book or Pamphlet whatsoever from the said Earl of  O  d  late Lord Treasurer or from any Person by his Order or Direction since the Time that the late Earl of  G  in  was Lord Treasurer Neither did I ever shew or cause to be shew'd to his Lordship for his Approbation Correction Alteration or for any other Cause any Book Paper or Pamphlet which I have Written and Publish'd before the same was Printed work'd off at the Press and Publish'd  If any Man living can detect me of the least Prevarication in this or in any Part of it I desire him to do it by all means and I challenge all the World to do it  And if they cannot  then I appeal  as in my Title  to the Honour and Justice of my worst Enemies to know upon what Foundation of Truth or Conscience they can affirm these things and for what it is that I bear these Reproaches  In all my Writing I ever capitulated for my Liberty to speak according to my own Judgment of Things I ever had that Liberty allow'd me nor was I ever imposed upon to write this way or that against my Judgment by any Person whatsoever  I come now historically to the Point of Time when my Lord  Godolphin  was dismiss'd from his Employment and the late unhappy Division broke out at Court I waited on my Lord the Day he was displac'd and humbly ask'd his Lordship's Direction what Course I should take His Lordship's Answer was  That he had the same good Will to assist me but not the same Power That I was the Queen's Servant and that all he had done for me was by Her Majesty's special and particular Direction and that whoever should succeed him it was not material to me he supposed I should be employ'd in nothing relating to the present Differences My Business was to wait till I saw things settled and then apply my self to the Ministers of State to receive Her Majesty's Commands from them  It occur'd to me immediately as a Principle for my Conduct that it was not material to me what Ministers Her Majesty was pleas'd to employ my Duty was to go along with every Ministry so far as they did not break in upon the Constitution and the Laws and Liberties of my Country my Part being only the Duty of a Subject  viz  to submit to all lawful Commands and to enter into no Service which was not justifiable by the Laws To all which I have exactly oblig'd my self  By this I was providentially cast back upon my Original Benefactor who according to his wonted Goodness was pleased to lay my Case before Her Majesty and thereby I preserv'd my Interest in Her Majesty's Favour but without any Engagement of Service  As for Consideration Pension Gratification or Reward I declare to all the World I have had none except only that old Appointment which Her Majesty was pleased to make me in the Days of the Ministry of my Lord  Godolphin  Of which I have spoken already and which was for Services done in a foreign Country some Years before Neither have I been employ'd or directed or order'd by my Lord T  r aforesaid to do or not to do any thing in the Affairs of the unhappy Differences which have so long perplex'd us and for which I have suffer'd so many and such unjust Reproaches  I come next to enter into the Matters of Fact and what it is I have done or not done which may justify the Treatment I have met with And first for the Negative Part what I have not done  The first Thing in the unhappy Breaches which have fallen out is helping up Scandal upon the Persons and Conduct of Men of Honour on one Side as well  on the other those unworthy Methods of falling upon one another by personal Calumny and Reproach This I have often in print complain'd of as an unchristian ungenerous and unjustifiable Practice Not a Word can be found in all I have written reflecting on the Persons or Conduct of any of the  former Ministry I serv'd Her Majesty under their Administration they acted honourably and justly in every Transaction in which I had the Honour to be concern'd with them and I never publish'd or said any thing dishonourable of any of them in my Life Nor can the worst Enemy I have produce any such thing against me I always regretted the Change and look'd upon it as a great Disaster to the Nation in general I am sure it was so to me in particular and the Divisions and Feuds among Parties which follow'd that Change were doubtless a Disaster to us all  The next Thing which follow'd the Change was THE PEACE No Man can say that ever I once said in my Life that I approv'd of the Peace I wrote a publick Paper at that time and there it Remains upon Record against me I printed it openly and that so plainly as others durst not do That I did not like the Peace neither that which was made nor that which was before a making That I I thought the Protestant Interest was not taken care of in either That the Peace I was for was such as should neither have given the  Spanish  Monarchy to the House of  Bourbon  or the House of  Austria  but that this Bone of Contention should have been broken to Pieces that it should not have been dangerous to  Europe  on any Account and that the Protestant Powers  viz Britain  and the  States  should have so strengthen'd and fortify'd their Interest by their sharing the Commerce and Strength of  Spain  as should have made them no more afraid either of  France  or the  Emperor  So  that the Protestant Interest should have been superior to all the Powers of  Europe  and been in no more Danger of exhorbitant Power whether  French  or  Austrian  This was the Peace I always argued for pursuant to the Design of King  William  in the Treaty of Partition and pursuant to that Article of the Grand Alliance which was directed by the same glorious Hand at the Beginning of this last War  viz  That all we should conquer in the  SpanishWestIndies  should be our own  This was with a true Design that  England  and  Holland  should have turn'd their Naval Power which were eminently superiour to those of  France  to the Conquest of the  SpanishWestIndies  by which the Channel of Trade and Return of Bullion which now enriches the Enemies of both had been ours and as the Wealth so the Strength of the World had been in Protestant Hands  Spain  whoever had it must then have been dependant upon us the House of  Bourbon  would have found it so poor without us as to be scarce worth fighting for and the People so averse to them for want of their Commerce as not to make it ever likely  France  could keep it  This was the Foundation I ever acted upon with relation to the Peace It is true that when it was made and could not be otherwise I thought our Business was to make the best of it and rather to enquire what Improvements were to be made of it than to be continually exclaiming at those who made it and where the Objection lies against this Part I cannot yet see  While I spoke of things in this manner I bore infinite Reproaches from clamouring Pens of being in the  French  Interest being hir'd and brib'd to defend a bad Peace and the like and most of this was upon a Supposition of my Writing or being the Author of Abundance of Pamphlets which came out every Day and which I had no hand in And indeed as I shall observe again by and by this was one of the greatest Pieces of Injustice that could be done me and which I labour still under without any redress that whenever any Piece comes out which is not liked I am immediately charg'd with being the Author and very often the first Knowledge I have had of a Books being publish'd has been from seeing my self abused for being the Author of it in some other Pamphlet publish'd in Answer to it  Finding my self treated in this manner I declin'd writing at all and for a great Part of a Year never set Pen to Paper except in the publick Paper call'd the  Review  After this I was long absent in the  North  of  England  and observing the Insolence of the  Jacobite  Party and how they insinuated fine things into the Heads of the Common People of the Right and Claim of the  Pretender  and of the great Things he would do for us if he was to come in of his being to turn a Protestant of his being resolved to maintain our Liberties support our Funds give Liberty to Dissenters and the like and finding that the People began to be deluded and that the  Jacobites  gain'd ground among them by these Insinuations I thought  it the best Service I could do the Protestant Interest and the best way to open the Peoples Eyes to the Advantages of the Protestant Succession if I took some Course effectually to alarm the People with what they really ought to expect if the  Pretender  should come to be King And this made me set Pen to Paper again  And this brings me to the affirmative Part or to what really I HAVE DONE and in this I am sorry to say I have one of the foulest most unjust and unchristian Clamours to complain of that any Man has suffer'd I believe since the Days of the Tyranny of King  James  the Second The Fact is thus  In order to detect the Influence of  Jacobite  Emissaries as above the first thing I wrote was a small Tract call'd  A Seasonable Caution  A Book sincerely written to open the Eyes of the poor ignorant Country People and to warn them against the subtle Insinuations of the Emissaries of the  Pretender  and that it might be effectual to that Purpose I prevail'd with several of my Friends to give them away among the poor People all over  England  especially in the  North  and several thousands were actually given away the Price being reduced so low that the bare Expence of Paper and Press was only preserv'd that every one might be convinc'd that nothing of Gain was design'd but a sincere Endeavour to do a publick Good and assist to keep the People entirely in the Interest of the Protestant Succession  Next to this and with the same sincere Design I wrote Two Pamphlets one entituled  What if the  Pretender  should come  The other  Reasons against the Succession of the House of  Hanover Nothing can be more plain than that the Titles of these Books were Amusements in order to put the Books into the Hands of those People who the  Jacobites  had deluded and to bring the Books to be read by them  Previous to what I shall farther say of these Books I must observe that all these Books met with so general a Reception and Approbation among those who were most sincere for the Protestant Succession that they sent them all over the Kingdom and recommended them to the Peoples reading as excellent and useful Pieces insomuch that about Seven Editions of them were Printed and they were Reprinted in other Places and I do protest had his present Majesty then Elector of  Hanover  given me a thousand Pounds to have written for the Interest of his Succession and to expose and render the Interest of the  Pretender  odious and ridiculous I could have done nothing more effectual to those Purposes than these Books were  And that I may make my worst Enemies to whom this is a fair Appeal Judges of this I must take leave by and by to repeat some of the Expressions in those Books which were direct and need no Explication and which I think no Man that was in the Interest of the  Pretender  nay which no Man but one who was entirely in the Interest of the  Hanover  Succession could write  Nothing can be severer in the Fate of a Man than to act so between two Parties that both Sides should be provok'd against him It is certain the  Jacobites  curs'd those Tracts and the Author and when they came to read them  being deluded by the Titles according to the Design  they threw them by with the greatest Indignation imaginable Had the  Pretender  ever come to the Throne I could have expected nothing but Death and all the Ignominy and Reproach that the most inveterate Enemy of his Person and Claim could be suppos'd to suffer  On the other hand I leave it to any considering Man to Judge what a Surprize it must be to me to meet with all the publick Clamour that Informers could invent  being Guilty of writing against the  Hanover  Succession and as having written several Pamphlets  in Favour of the  Pretender  No Man in this Nation ever had a more riv  d Aversion to the  Pretender  and to all the Family he pretended to come of  than I  A M  that had been in Arms under the Duke of  Monmouth  against the Cruelty and Arbitrary Government of his pretended Father That for twenty Years had to my utmost opposed him King  James  and his Party after his Abdication That had serv'd King  WILLIAM  to his Satisfaction and the Friends of the Revolution after his Death at all Hazards and upon all Occasions That had suffer'd and been ruin'd under the Administration of  Highfiyers  and  Jacobites  of whom some are  at this Day COƲNTERFEIT Whigs  It could  not be the Nature of the Thing could by no means allow it it must be monstrous and that the Wonder may cease I shall take leave to quote some of the Expressions out of these Books of which the worst Enemy I have in the World is left to Judge whether they are in Favour of the  Pretender  or no but of this in its Place  For these Books I was prosecuted taken into Custody and oblig'd to give Eight hundred Pound Bail  I do not in the least object here against or design to reflect upon the Proceedings of the Judges which were subsequent to this I acknowledg'd  then  and  now  acknowledge  again  that upon the Information given there was a sufficient Ground for all they did and my unhappy entring upon my own Vindication in Print while the Case was before their Lordships in a Judicial Way was an Error which I neither understood and which I did not foresee and therefore altho' I had great Reason to reflect upon the Informers yet I was wrong in making that Defence in the Manner and Time I then made it and which when I found I made no scruple afterward to Petition the Judges and acknowledge that they had just Ground to resent it Upon which Petition and Acknowledgment their Lordships were pleas'd with particular Marks of Goodness to release me and not take the Advantage of an Error of Ignorance as if it had been consider'd and premeditated  But against the  INFORMERS  I think I have great Reason to complain and against  the Injustice of those Writers who in many Pamphlets charged me with writing for the  Pretender  and the Government with pardoning an Author who wrote for the  Pretender  and indeed the Justice of those Men can be in nothing more clearly stated than in this Case of mine where the Charge in their Printed Papers and Publick Discourse was brought not that they themselves believ'd me Guilty of the Crime but because it was necessary to blacken the Man That a general Reproach might serve for an Answer to whatever he should say that was not for their Turn So that it was the Person not the Crime they fell upon and they may justly be said to persecute for the sake of Persecution  as will thus appear  This Matter making some Noise People began to enquire into it and to ask what  De Foe  was prosecuted for seeing the Books were manifestly written against the  Pretender  and for the Interest of the House of  Hanover  And my Friends expostulated freely with some of the Men who appear'd in it who answer'd  with more Truth than Honesty  That they knew this Book had nothing in it and that it was meant another way but that  De Foe  had disoblig'd them in other things and they were resolv'd to take the Advantage they had both to punish and expose him They were no inconsiderable People who said this and had the Case come to a Tryal I had provided good Evidence to prove the Words  This is the Christianity and Justice by which I have been treated and this Injustice is the thing that I complain of  Now as this was a Plot of a few Men to see if they could brand me in the World for a  Jacobite  and perswade rash and ignorant People that I was turn'd about for the  Pretender I think they might as easily have prov'd me to be a Mahometan  therefore I say this obliges me to state that Matter as it really stands that impartial Men may Judge whether those Books were written for or against the  Pretender  and this cannot be better done than by the Account of what follow'd after the first Information which in few Words is thus  Upon the several Days appointed I appear'd at the  Queen's Be  Bar  to discharge my Bail and at last had an Indictment for High Crimes and Misdemeanours exhibited against me by Her Majesty's AttorneyGeneral which as I was inform'd contain'd two hundred Sheets of Paper  What was the Substance of the Indictment I shall not mention here neither could I enter upon it having never seen the Particulars But I was told that I should be brought to Tryal the very next Term  I was not ignorant that in such Cases it is easy to make any Book a Libel and that the Jury must have found the Matter of Fact in the Indictment  viz  That I had written such Books and then what might have follow'd I knew not Wherefore I thought it was my only way to cast my self on the Clemency of her Majesty whose Goodness I had had so much Experience of many ways representing in my Petition that I was far from the least  Intention to favour the Interest of the  Pretender  but that the Books were all written with a sincere Design to promote the Interest of the House of  Hanover  and humbly laid before her Majesty as I do now before the rest of the World the Books themselves to plead in my behalf representing farther that I was maliciously inform'd against by those who were willing to put a Construction upon the Expressions different from my true Meaning and therefore flying to her Majesty's Goodness and Clemency I entreated her Gracious PARDON  It was not only the native Disposition of her Majesty to Acts of Clemency and Goodness that obtain'd me this Pardon but as I was inform'd her Majesty was pleas'd to express it in the Council  She saw nothing but private Pique in the first Prosecution  and therefore I think I cannot give a better and clearer Vindication of my self than what is contain'd in the Preamble to the Pardon which her Majesty was pleas'd to grant me and I must be allow'd to say to those who are still willing to object that I think what satisfy'd her Majesty might be sufficient to satisfy them and I can assure them that this Pardon was not granted without her Majesty's being specially and particularly acquainted with the things alledg'd in the Petition the Books also being look'd in to find the Expressions quoted in the Petition The Preamble to the Patent for a Pardon as far as relates to the Matters of Fact runs thus  WHereas in the Term of the  Holy Trinity  last past our Artorney General did exhibit an Information in our Court of  QueensBench  at  Westminster  against  DANIEL DE FOE  late of  London  Gent for Writing Printing and Publishing and causing to be Written Printed and Published THREE LIBELS the one entituled  Reasons against the Succession of the House of  Hanover  with an Enquiry how far the Abdication of King  James  supposing it to be legal ought to affect the Person of the  Pretender One other entituled  And what if the  Pretender  should Come Or some Considerations of the Advantages and real Consequences of the  Pretender  's possessing the Crown of  Great Britain And one other entituled  An Answer to a Question that nobody thinks of  viz  What if the Queen should Die  And whereas the said  Daniel De Foe  hath by his humble Petition represented to us that he with a sincere Design to propagate the Interest of the  Hanover Succession  and to animate the People against the Designs of the  Pretender  whom he always looked on as an Enemy to our Sacred Person and Government  did publish  the said Pamphlets In all which Books altho' the Titles seem'd to look as if written in Favour of the  Pretender  and several Expressions as in all ironical Writing it must be may be wrested against the true Design of the Whole and turn'd to a Meaning quite different from the Intention of the Author yet the Petitioner humbly assures us in the solemnest Manner that his true and only Design in all the said Books was by an ironical Discourse of recommending the  Pretender  in the strongest and most forcible Manner to expose his Designs and the ruinous Consequences of his succeeding therein which as the Petitioner humbly represents will appear to our Satisfaction by the Books themselves where the following Expressions are very plain  viz  That the PRETENDER is recommended  as a Person proper to amass the  English  Liberties into his own Soveraignty supply them with the Privileges of wearing WOODEN SHOES easing them of the trouble of chusing Parliaments and the Nobility and Gentry of the Hazard and Expence of Winter Journeys by governing them in that more righteous Method of his ABSOLUTE WILL and enforcing the Laws by a Glorious STANDING ARMY paying all the Nations Debts at once by stopping the Funds and shutting up the  Exchequer  easing and quieting their Differences in Religion by bringing them to the UNION of POPERY or leaving them at Liberty to have no Religion at all  That these were some of the very Expressions in the said Books which the Petitioner sincerely design'd to expose and oppose as far as in him lies the  Interest  of the  Pretender  and with no other Intention NEVERTHELESS the Petitioner to his great Surprize has been misrepresented and his said Books misconstrued as if written in Favour of the  Pretender  and the Petitioner in now under Prosecution for the same which Prosecution if farther carried on will be the utter Ruin of the Petitioner and his Family Wherefore the Petitioner humbly assuring us of the Innocence of his Design as aforesaid files to our Clemency and most humbly  prays our most Gracious and Free Pardon WE taking the Premisses and the Circumstances aforesaid into our Royal Consideration are graciously pleas'd  c  Let any indifferent Man Judge whether I was not treated with particular Malice in this Matter who was notwithstanding this reproach'd in the daily Publick Prints with having written treasonable Books in behalf of the  Pretender  nay and in some of those Books as before the Queen her self was rereproach'd  with having granted her Pardon to an Author who writ for the  Pretender  I think I might with much more Justice say I was  the first Man  that ever was oblig'd to seek a Pardon for writing for the  Hanover  Succession and  the first Man  that these People ever sought to Ruin for writing against the  Pretender  For if ever a Book was sincerely design'd to farther and propogate the Affection and Zeal of the Nation against the  Pretender  nay and was made use of and that with success too for that purpose THESE BOOKS  were so  and I ask no more Favour of the World to determine the Opinion of honest Men for or against me than what is drawn constructively from these Books Let one Word either written or spoken by me either publish'd or not publish'd be produced that was in the least disrespectful to the Protestant Succession or to any Branch of the Family of  Hanover  or that can be judg'd to be favourable to the Interest or Person of the  Pretender  and I will be willing to wave  her Majesty's Pardon and render my self to Publick Justice to be punish'd for it as I should well deserve  I freely and openly Challenge the worst of my Enemies to charge me with any Discourse Conversation or Behaviour in my whole Life which had the least Word in it injurious to the Protestant Succession unbecoming or disrespectful to any of the Persons of the Royal Family of  Hanover  or the least favourable Word of the Person the Designs or Friends of the  Pretender  If they can do it let them stand forth and speak no doubt but they may be heard and I for my part will relinquish all Pleas Pardons and Defences and cast my self into the Hands of Justice  Nay to go farther I defy them to prove that I ever kept Company or had any Society Friendship or Conversation with any  Jacobite  so averse have I been to the Interest and to the People that I have studiously avoided their Company upon all Occasions  As nothing in the World has been more my Aversion than the Society of  Jacobites  so nothing can be a greater Misfortune to me than to be accus'd and publickly reproach'd with what is of all things in the World most abhorr'd by me and which has made it the more afflicting is that this Charge arises from those very things which I did with the sincerest Design to manifest the contrary  But such is my present Fate and I am to submit to it which I do with Meekness and Calmness as to a Judgment from Heaven and am practising that Duty which I have studied long ago of  Forgiving my Enemies  and  praying for them that despitefully use me  Having given this brief History of the Pardon  c  I hope the Impartial part of the World will Grant me That being thus Graciously Deliver'd a second Time from the Cruelty of my Implacable Enemies and the Ruin of a Cruel and unjust Persecution and that by the meer Clemency and Goodness of the Queen my Obligation to her Majesty's Goodness was far from being made less than it was before  I have now run through the History of my Ohligation to her Majesty and to the Person of my Benefactor aforesaid I shall state every thing that follow'd this with all the Clearness I can and leave my self lyable to as little Cavil as I may for I see my self assaulted by a sort of People who will do me no justice I hear a Great Noise made of Punishing those that are GUILTY but as I said before not one Word of Clearing those that are INNOCENT and I must say in this Part they Treat me not only as I were no Christian but as if they themselves were not Christians They will neither prove the Charge nor hear the Defence which is the unjustest thing in the World  I foresee what will be alledged to the Clause of my Obligation  c  to Great Persons And I resolve to give my Adversaries all the  Advantage they can desire by acknowledging beforehand That  no Obligation to the QƲEEN or to any Benefactor can justify any Man's acting against the Interest of his Country against his Principles his Conscience and his former Profession  I think this will Anticipate all that can be said upon that Head and it will then remain to state the Fact as I am or am not Chargeable with it which I shall do as clearly as possible in few words  It is none of my Work to enter into the Conduct of the Queen or of the Ministry in this Case the Question is not what  they have done  but what  I have done  And tho' I am very far from thinking of them as some other People think yet for the sake of the present Argument I am to give them all up and Suppose  tho' not Granting  that all which is suggested of them by the worst Temper the most censorious Writer the most scandalous Pamphlet or Lampoon should be True and I'll go through some of the Particulars as I meet with them in Publick    st  That they made a Scandalous Peace unjustly Broke the Allyance Betray'd the Confederates and Sold us all to the  French  God forbid it should be all Truth in the manner that we see it in Print But that I say is none of my Business  But what hand had I in all this  I never wrote one word for the Peace  before it was made  or to Justify it after  it was made  let them produce it if they can  Nay in a  Review  upon that Subject while it was making I Printed it in plainer Words than other Men durst Speak it at that Time That  I did not like the Peace  nor did I like any Peace that was a making since that of the PARTITION and that the Protestant Interest was not taken Care of either in that or the Treaty of  Gertrudinburgh  before it  It is true that I did say That since the Peace was made and we could not help it that it was our Business and our Duty to make the best of it to make the utmost Advantage of it by Commerce Navigation and all kind of Improvement that we could and this I SAY STILL and I must think it is more our Duty to do so than the Exclamations against the thing it self which it is not in our power to Retrieve This is all that the worst Enemy I have can Charge me with  After the Peace was made  and the  Dutch  and the Emperor stood out I gave my Opinion of what I foresaw would necessarily be the Consequence of that Difference  viz  That it would inevitably involve these Nations in a War with one or other of them  any one  who was Master of Common Sense in the publick Affairs might see that the standing out of the  Dutch  could have no other Event For if the Confederates had Conquer'd the  French  they would certainly have fallen upon us by way of Resentment and there was no doubt but the same Councils that led us to make a Peace would Oblige us to maintain it by preventing too great Impressions upon the  French  On the other hand  I alledged that should the  French  prevail against the  Dutch  unless he stopt at such Limitations of Conquest as the Treaty oblig'd him to do we must have been under the same necessity to renew the War against  France  and for this Reason seeing we had made a Peace we were oblig'd to bring the rest of the Confederates into it and to bring the  French  to give them all such Terms as they ought to be satisfied with  This way of Arguing was either so little Understood or so much Malign'd that I suffer'd innumerable Reproaches in Print for having Written for a War with the  Dutch  which was neither in the Expression or ever in my Imagination But I pass by these Injuries as small and trifling compar'd to others  I  suffer under  However one thing  I  must say of the Peace  Let it be Good or Ill in its self  I cannot but think we have all reason to Rejoyce in behalf of his Present Majesty That at his accession to the Crown He found the Nation in Peace and had the Hands of the King of  France  tied up by a Peace so as not to be able without the most infamous breach of Articles to offer the least Disturbance to his taking a Quiet and Leisurely possession or so much as to Countenance those that would  Not but that  I  believe if the War had been at the height we should have been able to have preserved the Crown for his present Majesty its only Rightful Lord But  I  will not say it should have been so Easy so Bloodless so Undisputed as now and all the Difference  must be acknowledged to the Peace and this is all the Good  I  ever yet said of the Peace  I  come next to the general Clamour of  the Ministry being for the Pretender I  must speak my Sentiments solemnly and plainly as I always did in that matter  viz  That if it was so  I  did not see it nor did I ever see Reason to believe it This  I  am sure of that if it was so  I  never took one step in that kind of Service nor did  I  ever hear one Word spoken by any one of the Ministry that  I  had the Honour to know or Converse with that favour'd the Pretender But have had the Honour to hear them all Protest that there was no Design to Oppose the Succession of  Hanover  in the least  It may be Objected to me That they might be in the Interest of the Pretender for all that  It is true they might  But that is nothing to me  I  am not Vindicating their Conduct but my own as  I  never was Employ'd in any thing that way so  I  do still protest  I  do not believe it was ever in their Design and  I  have many Reasons to confirm my Thoughts in that Case which are not material to the present Case But be that as it will it is enough to me that  I  acted nothing in any such Interest neither did  I  ever Sin against the Protestant Succession of  Hanover  in Thought Word or Deed and if the Ministry did  I  did not see it or so much as suspect them of it  It was a Disaster to the Ministry to be driven to the Necessity of taking that Set of Men by the hand who no body can deny were  in that Interest But as the former Ministry answer'd when they were charg'd with a Design to overthrow the Church because they favour'd joyn'd with and were united to the  Dissenters  I say they answer'd  That they made use of the  Dissenters  but granted them nothing  WHICH BY THE WAY WAS TOO TRUE So these Gentlemen Answer  That it is true they made use of  Jacobites  but did nothing for them  But  this by the by  Necessity is pleaded by both Parties for doing things which neither Side can justify I wish both Sides would for ever avoid the Necessity of doing Evil for certainly it is the worst Plea in the World and generally made use of for the worst Things  I have often lamented the Disaster which I saw employing  Jacobites  was to the late Ministry and certainly it gave the greatest Handle to the Enemies of the Ministry to fix that universal Reproach upon them of being in the Interest of the  Pretender  But there was no Medium The  Whigs  refused to shew them a safe Retreat or to give them the least Opportunity to take any other Measures but at the Risque of their own Destruction and they ventur'd upon that Course in hopes of being able to stand alone at last without help of either the one or the other in which no doubt they were mistaken  However in this Part as I was always assur'd and have good Reason still to believe that her Majesty was steady in the Interest of the House of  Hanover  and that nothing was  ever offer'd to me or requir'd of me to the Prejudice of that Interest On what Ground can I be reproach'd with the secret reserv'd Designs of any if they had such Designs as I still verily believe they had not  I see there are some Men who would fain perswade the World that every Man that was in the Interest of the late Ministry or employ'd by the late Government or that serv'd the late Queen was for the  Pretender  God forbid this should be true and I think there needs very little to be said in Answer to it I can answer for my self that it is notoriously false and I think the easy and uninterrupted Accession of his Majesty to the Crown contradicts it I see no End which such a Suggestion aims at but to leave an Odium upon all that had any Duty or Regard to her late Majesty  A Subject is not always Master of his Sovereign's Measures nor always to examine what Persons or Parties the Prince he serves Employs so be it that they break not in upon the Constitution that they govern according to Law and that he is employ'd in no illegal Act or have nothing desir'd of him inconsistent with the Liberties and Laws of his Country If this be not right then a Servant of the King's is in a worse Case than a Servant to any private Person  In all these things I have not err'd neither have I acted or done any thing in the whole Course of my Life either in the Service of her Majesty or of her Ministry that any one can say has the least Deviation from the strictest  Regard to the Protestant Succession and to the Laws and Liberties of my Country  I never saw an Arbitrary Action offer'd at a Law dispens'd with Justice deny'd or Oppression set up either by Queen or Ministry in any Branch of the Administration wherein I had the least Concern  If I have sin'd against the  Whigs  it has been all NEGATIVELY  viz  that I have not joyn'd in the loud Exclamations against the Queen and against the Ministry and against the Measures and if this be my Crime my Plea is twofold  I did not really see Cause for carrying their Complaints to that violent Degree  Where I did see what as before I lamented and was sorry for and could not joyn with or approve as joyning with  Jacobites  the  Peace  c My Obligation is my Plea for my silence  I have all the good Thoughts of the Person and good Wishes for the Prosperity of my Benefactor that Charity and that Gratitude can inspire me with I ever believ'd him to have the true Interest of the Protestant Religion and of his Country in his view if it should be otherwise I should be very sorry And I must repeat it again that he always left me so entirely to my own Judgment in every thing I did that he never prescrib'd to me what I should write or should not write in my Life neither did he ever concern himself  to dictate to or restrain me in any kind nor did he see any one Tract that I ever wrote before it was Printed So that all the Notion of my writing by his Direction is as much a Slander upon him as it is possible any thing of that kind can be and if I have written any thing which is offensive unjust or untrue I must do that Justice as to declare He has had no hand in it the Crime is my own  As the Reproach of his directing me to write is a Slander UPON THE PERSON I am speaking of so that of my receiving Pensions and Payments from him for writing is a Slander UPON ME and I speak it with the greatest Sincerity Seriousness and Solemnity that it is possible for a Christian Man to speak That except the Appointment I mention'd before which her Majesty was pleas'd to make me formerly and which I receiv'd during the time of my Lord  Godolphin  's Ministry I have not receiv'd of the late Lord Treasurer or of any one else by his Order Knowledge or Direction one Farthing or the Value of a Farthing during his whole Administration nor has all the Interest I have been suppos'd to have in his Lordship been able to procure me the Arrears due to me in the time of the other Ministry SO HELP ME GOD  I am under no Necessity of making this Declaration The Services I did and for which her Majesty was pleas'd to make me a small Allowance are known to the greatest Men in the present Administration and some of them were then of the Opinion and I hope  are so still that I was not unworthy of her Majesty's Favour The Effect of those Services however small are enjoy'd by those Great Persons and by the whole Nation to this Day and I had the Honour once to be told  That they should never be forgotten  It is a Misfortune that no Man can avoid to forfeit for his Deference to the Person and Services of his Queen to whom he was inexpressibly oblig'd And if I am fallen under the Displeasure of the PRESENT Government for any thing I ever did in Obedience to her Majesty in THE PAST I may say it is my Disaster but I can never say it is my Fault  This brings me again to that other Oppression which as I said I suffer under and which I think is of a Kind that no Man ever suffer'd under so much as my self And this is to have every Libel every Pamphlet be it ever so foolish so malicious so unmannerly or so dangerous be laid at my Door and be call'd publickly by my Name It has been in vain for me to struggle with this Injury It has been in vain for me to protest to declare solemnly nay if I would have sworn that I had no hand in such a Book or Paper never saw it never read it and the like it was the same thing  My Name has been hackney'd about the Street by the Hawkers and about the CoffeeHouses by the Politicians at such a rate as no Patience could bear One Man will swear to the Style another to this or that Expression another to the Way of Printing and all so positive that it is to no purpose to oppose it  I publish'd once to stop this way of using me that I would Print nothing but what I set my Name to and I held it for a Year or Two but it was all one I had the same Treatment I now have resolv'd for some time to write nothing at all and yet I find it the same thing Two Books lately publish'd being call'd mine for no other reason that I know of than that at the Request of the Printer I revised two Sheets of them at the Press and that they seem'd to be written in Favour of a certain Person which Person also as I have been assur'd had no Hand in them or any Knowledge of them till they were publish'd in Print  This is a Flail which I have no Fence against but to complain of the Injustice of it and that is but  the shortest Way  to be treated with more Injustice  There is a mighty Charge against me for being Author and Publisher of a Paper call'd  The MERCATOR  I'll state the Fact first and then speak to the Subject  It is true that being desir'd to give my Opinion in the Affair of the Commerce with  France  I did as I often had done in Print many Years before declare That it was my Opinion we ought to have an open Trade with  France  because I did believe we might have the Advantage by such a Trade and of this Opinion I am still What Part I had in the  Mercator  is well known and would Men Answer with Argument and not with personal Abuses I would at any time defend every Part of the  Mercator  which was of my doing  But to say the  Mercator  was mine is false I neither was the Author of it had the Property of it the Printing of it or the Profit by it I had never any Payment or Reward for writing any Part of it Nor had I the Power to put what I would into it Yet the whole Clamour fell upon me because they knew not who else to load with it And when they came to Answer the Method was instead of Argument to threaten and reflect upon me reproach me with private Circumstances and Misfortunes and give Language which no Christian ought to give and which no Gentleman ought to take  I thought any  Englishman  had the Liberty to speak his Opinion in such things for this had nothing to do with the Publick The Press was open to me as well as to others and how or when I lost my  English  Liberty of speaking my Mind I know not neither how my speaking my Opinion without Fee or Reward could authorize them to call me Villain Rascal Traytor and such opprobious Names  It was ever my Opinion and is so still that were our Wooll kept from  France  and our Manufactures spread in  France  upon reasonable Duties all the Improvement which the  French  have made in Woolen Manufactures would decay and in the End be little Worth and consequently the Hurt they could do us by them would be of little Moment  It was my Opinion and is so still that the Ninth Article of the Treaty of  Commerce  was calculated for the Advantage of our Trade let who will make it  that is nothing to me  My  Reasons are because it TYED up the  French  to open the Door to our Manufactures at a certain Duty of Importation THERE and left the Parliament of  Britain  at Liberty to shut theirs out by as high Duties as they pleas'd HERE there being no Limitation upon us as to Duties on  French  Goods  but that other Nations should pay the same  While the  French  were thus bound and the  British  free I always thought we must be in a Condition to Trade to Advantage or it must be our own Fault This was my Opinion and IS SO STILL and I would venture to maintain it against any Man upon a publick Stage before a Jury of fifty Merchants and venture my Life upon the Cause if I were assured of fair Play in the Dispute But that it was my Opinion That we might carry on a Trade with  France  to our great Advantage and that we ought for that reason to Trade with them appears in the Third Fourth Fifth and Sixth Volume of the  Reviews  above Nine Year before the  Mercator  was thought of it was not thought Criminal to say so then how it comes to be Villainous to say so now God knows I can give no account of it I am still of the same Opinion and shall never be brought to say otherwise unless I see the state of Trade so altered as to alter my Opinion and if ever I do I will be able to give good Reasons for it  The Answer to these things whether mine or no was all pointed at me and the Arguments were generally in the Terms of Villain Rascal Miscreant Lyer Bankrupt Fellow Hireling  TurnCoat  c  what the Arguments were better'd by these Methods that I leave to others to Judge of Also most of those things in the  Mercator  for which I had such Usage were such as I was not the Author of  I do grant had all the Books which have been called by my Name been written by me I must of Necessity have exasperated every Side and perhaps have deserved it but I have the greatest Injustice imaginable in this Treatment as I have in the perverting the Design of what really I have written To sum up therefore my Complaint in few Words  I was from my first entring into the Knowledge of publick Matters and have ever been to this Day a sincere Lover of the Constitution of my Country zealous for Liberty and the Protestant Interest but a constant Follower of moderate Principles a vigorous Opposer of hot Measures in all Parties I never once changed my Opinion my Principles or my Party and let what will be said of changing Sides this I maintain That I never once deviated from the Revolution Principles nor from the Doctrine of Liberty and Property on which it was founded  I own I could never be convinc'd of the great  Danger  of the PRETENDER in the Time of the late Ministry Nor can I be now convinc'd of the great  Danger  of the CHURCH under this Ministry I believe the Cries of one was politically made use of then to serve other Designs and I plainly see the like Use made of the other now I spoke my Mind freely then and I have done the like  now in a small Tract to that purpose not yet made publick and which if I live to publish I will publickly own as I purpose to do every thing I write that my Friends may know when I am abused and they impos'd on  It has been the Disaster of all Parties in this Nation to be very HOT in their Turn and as often as they have been SO I have differed with them all and ever must and shall do so I'll repeat some of the Occasions on the  Whigs  Side because from that Quarter the Accusation of my turning about comes  The first Time  I had the Misfortune to differ with my Friends was about the Year when the  Turks  were besieging  Vienna  and the  Whigs  in  England  generally speaking were for the  Turks  taking it which I having read the History of the Cruelty and perfidious Dealings of the  Turks  in their Wars and how they had rooted out the Name of the Christian Religion in above Threescore and Ten Kingdoms could by no means agree with And tho' then but a young Man and a younger Author I opposed it and wrote against it which was taken very unkindly indeed  The next Time  I differed with my Friends was when King  James  was wheedling the  Dissenters  to take off the Penal Laws and Test which I could by no means come into And as  in the first  I used to say I had rather the Popish House of  Austria  should ruin the Protestants in  Hungaria  than the Infidel House of  Ottoman  should ruin both Protestant and Papist by overrunning  Germany  So in the  other I told the  Dissenters  I had rather th Church of  England  should pull our Cloaths off by Fines and Forfeitures than the Papists should fall both upon the  Church  and the  Dissenters  and pull our Skins off by Fire and Fagot  The next  Difference I had with good Men was about the scandalous Practice of  Occasional Conformity  in which I had the Misfortune to make many honest Men angry rather because I had the better of the Argument than because they disliked what I said  And now I have lived to see the  Dissenters  themselves very quiet if not very well pleased with an Act of Parliament to prevent it Their  iends indeed laid it on they would be Friends indeed if they would talk of taking it off again  Again  I had a Breach with honest Men for their Male treating King  William  of which I say nothing Because I think they are now opening their Eyes and making what amends they can to his Memory  The fifth  Difference I had with them was about the  Treaty of Partition  in which many honest Men were mistaken and in which I told them plainly then That they would at last End the War upon  worse Terms  and so it is my Opinion they would have done tho' the Treaty of  Gertrudenburgh  had taken Place  The sixth Time  I differed with them was when the  Old Whigs  fell upon the  Modern Whigs  and when the Duke of  Marlborough  and my Lord  Godolphin  were used by the  Observator  in a Manner worse  I must confess for the Time it  lasted  than ever they were used since nay tho' it were by  Abel  and the  Examiner  But the Success failed In this Dispute my Lord  Godolphin  did me the Honour to tell me  I had served him  and  his Grace also  both  faithfully  and  successfully  But his Lordship is Dead and I have now no Testimony of it but what is to be found in the  Observator  where I am plentifully abused for being an Enemy to my Country by acting in the Interest of my Lord  Godolphin  and the Duke of  Marlborough What WeatherCock can Turn with such Tempers as these  I am now in  the seventh  Breach with them and my Crime now is That I will not believe and say the same things of the  Queen  and the late  Treasurer  which I could not believe before of my Lord  Godolphin  and the Duke of  Marlborough  and which in Truth I cannot believe and therefore could not say it of either of them and which if I had believed yet I ought not to have been the Man that should have said it for the Reasons aforesaid  In such Turns of Tempers and Times a Man must be tenfold  a Vicar of  Bray or it is impossible but he must one Time or other be out with every Body This is my present Condition and for this I am reviled with having abandon'd my Principles turn'd  Jacobite  and what not God Judge between me and these Men Would they come to any Particulars with me what real Guilt I may have I would freely acknowledge and if they would produce any Evidence of the Bribes the Pensions and the Rewards I have taken  I would declare honestly whether they were true or no If they would give a List of the Books which they charge me with and the Reasons why they lay them at my Door I would acknowledge any Mistake own what I have done and let them know what I have not done But these Men neither shew Mercy or leave place for Repentance in which they act not only unlike their Maker but contrary to his express Commands  It is true good Men have been used thus in former times and all the Comfort I have is that these Men have not the last Judgment in their Hands if they had dreadful would be the Case of those who oppose them But that Day will shew many Men and Things also in a different State from what they may now appear in some that now appear clear and fair will then be seen to be black and foul and some that are now thought black and foul will then be approved and accepted and thither I chearfully appeal concluding this Part in the Words of the Prophet  I heard the Defaming of many Fear on every side Report  say they  and we will Report it All my Familiars watch'd for my halting saying Peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail against him and we shall take our Revenge on him  Jerem  Mr  Pool's Annotations  has the following Remarks on these Lines which I think are so much to that Part of my Case which is to follow that I could not omit them His Words are these  'The Prophet  says he  here rendreth a Reason why he thought of giving over his Work as a  Prophet his Ears were continually filled with the Obloquies and Reproaches of such as reproached him and besides lie was afraid on all Hands there were so many Traps laid for him so many Devises devised against him They did not only take Advantage against him but sought Advantages and invited others to raise Stories of him Not only Strangers but those that he might have expected the greatest Kindness from those that pretended most courteously they watch  says he  for opportunities to do me Mischief and lay in wait for my Halting desiring nothing more than that I might be enticed to speak or do something which they might find Matter of a colourable Accusation that so they might satisfie their Malice upon me This hath always been the Genius of wicked Men  Job  and  David  both made Complaints much like this'  These are Mr  Pool's  Words  And this leads me to several Particulars in which my Case may without any Arrogance be likened to that of the Sacred Prophet except only the vast Disparity of the Persons  No sooner was the Queen Dead and the King as Right required proclaim'd but the Rage of Men encreased upon me to that Degree that the Threats and Insults I receiv'd were such as I am not able to express If I offered to say a word in favour of the present Settlement it was called fawning and turning round again on the other hand tho' I have meddled neither one way or other nor written one Book since the Queen's Death yet a great many things are call'd by my Name and I bear  every Day the Reproaches which all the Answerers of those Books cast as well upon the Subject as the Authors I have not seen or spoken to my Lord of  Oxford  but once since the King's Landing nor receiv'd the least Message Order or Writing from his Lordship or any other way Corresponded with him yet he bears the Reproach of my Writing in his Defence and I the Rage of Men for doing it I cannot say it is no Affliction to me to be thus used tho' my being entirely clear of the Facts is a true support to me  I am unconcerned at the Rage and Clamour of  Partymen  but I can not be unconcern'd to hear Men who I think are good Men and good Christians prepossess'd and mistaken about me However I cannot doubt but some time or other It will please God to open such Mens Eyes A constant steady adhering to  Personal Vertue  and to  Publick Peace  which I thank God I can appeal to him has always been my Practice will AT LAST restore me to the Opinion of Sober and Impartial Men and that is all I desire What it will do with those who are resolutely Partial and Unjust I cannot say neither is that much my Concern But I cannot forbear giving one Example of the hard Treatment I receive which has happened even while I am Writing this Tract I have six Children I have Educated them as well as my Circumstances will permit and so as I hope shall recommed them to better Usage than their Father meets with in the World I am not indebted One Shilling in the World for any part of their Education  or for any thing else belonging to bringing them up yet the Author of the  FlyingPost  Published lately That I never pay'd for the Education of any of my Children If an Man in  Britain  has a Shilling to demand of me for any part of their Education or any thing belong to them let them come for it  But these Men care not what Injurious Things they Write nor what they Say whether Truth or Not if it may but raise a Reproach on me tho' it were to be my Ruine I may well Appeal to the Honour and Justice of my worst Enemies in such Cases as this  Conscia Mens Recti fama Mendacia Ridet  CONCLUSION by the Publisher  WHile this was at the Press and the Copy thus far finish'd the Author was seiz'd with a violent Fit of an Apoplexy whereby he was disabled finishing what he design'd in his farther Defence and continuing now for above Six Weeks in a Weak and Languishing Condition neither able to go on or likely to recover at least in any short time his Friends thought it not fit to delay the Publication of this any longer if he recovers he may be able to finish what he began if not it is the Opinion of most that know him that the Treatment which he here complains of and some others that he would have spoken of have been the apparent Cause of his Disaster  FINIS
