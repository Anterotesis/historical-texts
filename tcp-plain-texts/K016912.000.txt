 Mr BURKE's SPEECH IN WESTMINSTERHALL On the th and th of February WITH EXPLANATORY NOTES  THIS SPEECH CONTAINS WHAT MR BURKE IN HIS LETTER TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY CALLS  "THOSE STRONG FACTS WHICH THE MANAGERS FOR THE COMMONS HAVE OPENED AS OFFENCES AND WHICH GO SERIOUSLY TO AFFECT MR SHORE'S ADMINISTRATION AS ACTING CHIEF OF THE REVENUE BOARD"  WITH A PREFACE CONTAINING MR BURKE'S LETTER TO THE CHAIRMAN ON SIR JOHN SHORE'S APPOINTMENT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BENGAL AND REMARKS UPON THAT LETTER  LONDON PRINTED FOR J DEBRETT OPPOSITE BURLINGTONHOUSE PICCADILLY MDCCXCII  PREFACE  DURING the recess of Parliament when Mr Burke has no authority to interfere in his senatorial character in the concerns of any public body in the kingdom he has addressed a letter to the Chairman of the East India Company to the following effect  "That he has heard and that the report is generally credited that Mr Shore is in nomination or actually appointed to the office of Governor General of Bengal  That having been appointed by the House of Commons a Member of the Committee to impeach one of their late Governors General he thinks it his duty to inform the Chairman that in the exercise of the functions imposed on that Committee by the House they had found Mr Shore to be materially concerned  as a principal actor and party in certain of the offences charged upon Mr Hastings  namely in the maladministration of the Revenue Board of which under Mr Hastings he was for some considerable time the acting Chief  "That he thinks it incumbent upon him also to inform the Chairman that some of the matters charged as misdemeanors  in which it appears that Mr Shore was concerned  are actually in evidence before the Lords  "That other facts of a very strong nature which the Managers for the Commons  have opened as offences  are upon the Company's records copies of which are in the possession of the Managers and that they go  seriously to affect Mr Shore's administration as acting Chief of the Revenue Board    "That the Committee of Managers cannot consistently with their duty in making good the charge confided to them by the House of Commons avoid a proceeding on those matters or taking such steps both for supporting the evidence already before the Peers as well as putting the other and not less important matters into such a course of proceeding as the ends of justice and the public policy may require That the Managers have not in any instance deviated from their duty  "That in this situation it is for the Court of Directors to consider the consequences  which possibly may follow  from sending out in offices of the highest rank and of the highest possible power  persons whose conduct appearing on their own records is at the first view of it very reprehensible and against whom such criminal matter on such grounds in a manner so solemn and by men acting under such an authority as that of the House of Commons is partly at issue and the rest opened and offered before the highest Tribunal in the nation  "  Mr Burke in the first paragraph of his letter appears to be ignorant of what every man knew who looked into a newspaper a month ago  On the th of September the intended appointment of Sir John Shore was announced On the th he was unanimously appointed  On the d of October his Majesty was pleased to create him a Baronet of Great Britain so that he came under that description of persons whom to use Mr Burke's words  "The King delighteth to honour"  and we should have imagined that so loyal a subject as Mr Burke would have delighted to know the King's pleasure On the d of October Sir John Shore kissed hands on his creation and on his appointment and dined on that day with the Court of Directors and the King's Ministers On the th of October he was at the Queen's DrawingRoom On the th he left London On the th the day Mr Burke's letter is dated he was at Bath and quitted it to proceed to to Falmouth on the th  But Mr Burke is so much in the woods that he heard not one single word of these several circumstances though he does say that the account is generally credited of his being in nomination  or actually appointed    If he believed the last repeat he very well  knew  that whether the  first idea  of Sir John Shore's appointment originated in Leadenhallstreet in Mr Dundas's apartments at Somerset House or at Mr Pitt's seat at Holwood it could  only  be  made  with the  full complete and entire approbation of the King and his Ministers  The public must look to Mr Pitt and Mr Dundas for the propriety of Sir John Shore's appointment Mr Burke's letter is therefore a direct attack upon those ministers whom he has ventured to threaten with the future vengeance of Parliament for preferring a man whose conduct  he  and  he alone  has represented as at the first view of it  very reprehensible    We are confident that so strong an instance of presumption in an individual is not to be met with Mr Burke has no right at this moment to use the name or authority of the House of Commons for  any purpose whatever still less for that of intimidation Either his letter was intended to stop Sir John Shore's appointment to annul it if it had taken placeor it was an unmeaning rhapsody But Mr Burke does not know that the House will  reappoint  him a Manager It is even possible that the House may say  "We will not be the tools and instruments of corrupt revengeful or factious men of any party or description Above Â£ has by this time been expended in a disgraceful persecution of an indivual We voted to  continue  the impeachment of Mr Hastings not from any knowledge  we  had of the charges preferred against him for  we  never looked into a  single  allegation but because  we  thought a dissolution did not of necessity abate an impeachment and because we had so much confidence in  the sense  and  justice of the last House  as to believe that they did not place an implicit  credit in the assertions of any man but that they had  sober and rational grounds  for believing that Mr Burke  spoke truth  when he told them that Sir John Shore was  a creature of Mr Hastings  that kingdoms which Mr Hastings found flourishing he left  desolate  that a  whole people happy  at his accession he made miserable for thirteen years and that the  public revenues  which were  productive  on his arrival declined  rapidly  under his adminstration But to our  astonishment  the King's Ministers have promoted to the high office of Governor of Bengal the very man whom Mr Burke has  called the creature of Mr Hastings  and whom Mr Burke so strongly censured in WestminsterHall We find that this gentleman so selected has solemnly deposed before the Peers that Bengal had greatly  improved  in  population  and  agriculture  during the government of Mr Hastings that under  him  property  was better protected and the natives happier than under their own Sovereigns and that of Mr Hastings the Natives  had a very favourable opinion  Have the King's Ministers selected a man for so high an office who is capable of laying  perjury on his soul to serve Mr Hastings  and if not if Sir John Shore is to be  believed upon his oath  we disgrace ourselves and our Constituents by suffering such execrable falsehoods to continue to stain the journals of the last Parliament Nor is this all the King's India Minister has annually presented accounts of the state of Bengal to this House We have ourselves seen by those accounts the progressive improvement of the revenues of Bengal during his government and since his departure and they  prove  supposing the accounts to be  correct  that Sir John Shore has sworn the truth Whatever motives the King's India Ministers may  have for acting so  inconsistently  we ought to be actuated by a love of justice alone As Representatives of the people it would be disgraceful to us to vote away their money annually and to oppress in a manner unexampled in any age or nation a meritorious individual because infamy must rest somewhere if any part of this prosecution has been wantonly maliciously or carelessly undertaken But the infamy will fall upon our heads if after such clear and decisive proofs that Bengal was  not  in the situation described by Mr Burke we still permit him to say in the name of the Commons of Great Britain that the country has been desolated its inhabitants plundered and destroyed and its revenues diminished by Mr Hastings"  We think it much more natural for the House to declare these manly sentiments because  they are the sentiments  universally prevalent amongst their constituents  than to find them ready to second Mr Burke's attack of Sir John Shore or to vote alternately with Mr Dundas that white is black and black is white  But can Mr Burke in this instance depend upon Mr Pitt and was it an article in that curious treaty  We state this fact of the treaty on the authority of a pamphlet which is in every body's hands We have no doubt of the truth of it because Mr Burke declared in the House that Mr Pitt  had neutralized  and  dulcified  him by his conduct  on the impeachment of Mr Hastings    which so completely  neutralized  and  dulcified  Mr Burke that for two years he has ceased to abuse Mr Pitt in the gross terms which he formerly applied to him was it we ask an article of the treaty that the national purse the national honour the honour of the King and even of Mr Pitt himself should be ceded  for ever  to Mr Burke Though Mr Pitt may have listened  with calm tranquillity or with secret satisfaction to Mr Burke while he spent his rage upon his old connections or upon Mr Hastings yet he will hardly be pleased with so very direct an attack upon himself  It was a duty  imposed by the law  upon Mr Pitt and Mr Dundas to examine with the closest attention every transaction of Sir John Shore's public life before they  acquiesced  in his appointment We are  confident  that in this instance they performed their duty and we believe that  they  and not the Directors were induced to  solicit  Sir John Shore to accept the office because he appeared to them to have acted with the strictest integrity and honour and for the national interests in all those transactions which Mr Burke presumes to say appeared on the first view  very reprehensible    We are indeed well aware that Mr Burke has brought Mr Pitt and Mr Dundas into  an unfortunate dilemma Sir John Shore's appointment  does throw some little disgrace  upon  that impeachment  for which those Ministers  voted  but in justice to all parties we will state  how far they were concerned    The whole of that immense mass of matter which was called "Revenues" was opened by Mr Francis in a Committee of the whole House on the th of April The charge in substance was that between and Mr Hastings had violated private property had oppressed most grievously persons of all ages ranks and descriptions had annihilated the nobility and country gentlemen of a great empire and had materially injured the public revenues by his various and oppressive modes of collecting them  Mr Pitt most eloquently and strenuously opposed every allegation in the charge He  declared that Mr Francis's description of Bengal was utterly  unfounded  that country being in a most  flourishing  and  prosperous state  and that his statement of a  declining revenue  was  disproved by the evidence of figures    Mr Fox with much vehemence supported Mr Francis and expressed his concern that Mr Pitt  who had lately been in the habit of agreeing with them  should differ upon this  the most important of all their charges  Mr Fox undoubtedly was right that this was the  most important of all the articles  It was so stated by Mr Burke originally who declared that if Mr Hastings  had  improved the face of a country had made a numerous people happy had extended commerce and encreased population and the Public income  he  never would have conceived the idea of entering into a  minute scrutiny  of the conduct of such a man If this were not mere  verbiage  what can Mr Burke say after having heard the evidence of Sir John Shore  He was supported warmly by Mr Burke  Upon the division Mr Pitt Mr Grenville Mr Dundas and Lord Mulgrave the  four India Ministers with their Secretary Mr Rouse the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Law Officers of the Crown were in a minority Fiftyfive voted with Mr Pitt seventyone with Mr Francis who consequently carried his question by a majority of fifteen  To those who do not know what was the  routine  of business in the  last Parliament  it may be necessary to explain  how  such a circumstance occurred  It was the custom of the Treasury to send notes to their friends to request attendance when the Minister was anxious to succeed in a question and the Opposition had some active partizan who took the same means  to collect their forces  Mr Francis being a man of some consequence on their side the party were summoned  and they came in a body to his support    Whether Mr Pitt from delicacy did not issue his Treasury notes as it was a judicial question or whether he was determined that his influence should never be exercised  for Mr Hastings  though he took ample pains on many occasions to exercise it  against him  the fact is that from a thin attendance of Mr Pitt's friends he was left in a minority  But there were  other stages  in the course of this article when Mr Pitt might have thrown it out had he pleased for it was not presented to the House in its  present form  until the th of May and the Tuesday following was appointed for taking it into consideration At this time Mr Dundas had opened his first India Budget and to a man of  reason  it was perfectly clear that unless Mr Dundas  imposed false accounts upon the House  the Revenue Article was a gross libel on the Government of Bengal  A Member who believed Mr Dundas told truth and that the article was filled with false assertions took the liberty to speak to Mr Pitt on the th of May upon this subject and also to Mr Rouse He reminded Mr Pitt that he had voted against the Revenue article  in toto  He pointed out how glaringly it falsified all Mr Dundas's assertions and all his accounts and he asked Mr Pitt if he did not intend to oppose it on the Tuesday and to endeavour to throw it out altogether Mr Pitt told that Member in reply that he should give no further opposition to the article but he did not condescend to explain  his reasons  for being silent so that  in point of fact  Mr Pitt  actually voted  in direct contradiction to sentiments forcibly and eloquently delivered by himself any opposition by an unconnected Member to an article which Mr Pitt and Mr Fox supported would have been idle in the extreme  But if Mr Pitt had given  notice  that he would oppose the revenue article on  its third reading  and if then he had pointed out how materially it cut up all that Mr Dundas had said we are confident that the article would have been totally rejected We remember to have seen Mr Pitt a little ruffled on being left in a minority on a question relative to the African Carrying Trade he told the House that he would oppose the clause which had been carried against him  on the Report  and  then  an irresistible phalanx crowded down which insured his success  As the matter now stands we allow that the last Parliament agreed with Mr Francis that Bengal was  irretrievably ruined  and with Mr Dundas  that it was the most flourishing country in India    But  this House  is not at all responsible for the  absurdity  or the  injustice  of the last  what has this House ever heard about Bengal except from Mr Dundas and  his communications  have been most flattering indeed to Mr Hastings and to Sir John Shore who acted under him  Of the revenue article voted by the last Parliament this House  knows nothing  for the best of all possible reasons because it would not condescend  to inquire    This House voted two Resolutions  The first on the th of December the second on the th of February  The first that the Impeachment of Mr Hastings was  depending  or in other words that an impeachment existing at a dissolution was not  abated  by that dissolution  The second Resolution was that this House would proceed no further in the Impeachment beyond those articles  on which the Managers had already closed their evidence  excepting  only  to  Contracts Pensions    and  Allowances  and those were finished in six days in Westminster Hall  Beyond this the present House has not gone The articles voted by the last House may have been very well or very ill founded very true or very falseThey might have been considered with great care and attention or by far the greater number may not to this moment have been read by the Members who voted for themThis House neither knew nor cared about themThey  lent the authority of their name  to  all  that the Managers  had done in the last Parliament  of which they could know  nothing  and they  tied up Mr Burke  from  proceeding beyond certain specified points in future    We conclude it was an article of the treaty with Mr Pitt which the latter insisted upon that Mr Burke should not go on  eternally  because he  lamented  in the House  The th of February    that he was  compelled  to yield to the criminal impatience of the times and to give up all the remaining articles the Contracts excepted  Mr Burke therefore cannot stir one step without the  authority of the House  No consequences hostile to the Directors or to the King's Ministers can follow from Sir John Shore's appointment unless he can persuade the House to  rescind  their last resolution The House may undoubtedly prefer  new articles  even while Mr Hastings is upon his defenceThe House  may  prolong the trial as long as it lives and its successors may also continue it until a hundred more of the Judges make a journey to the other worldThere is nothing  substantially unjust  that the House may not do according to the strict forms of Parliamentary Impeachments but Mr Burke has no right to presume that the House  will  suffer him to move an inch beyond  a Reply  upon the matter  now at issue  If there is common sense in his letter he must move to impeach Mr Pitt and Mr Dundas for reducing to  contempt  the impeachment of Mr Hastings by nominating to the office of Governor General a man who has been  a principal actor and party  in the maladministration of the revenues but we confidently affirm that he has not a  shadow  of foundation on which to rest a charge against the King's Ministers or the Court of Directors The King's Ministers never would allow that the revenues had been ill administered  Mr Burke writes to the Chairman  "The Managers for the Commons have opened  facts of a very strong nature  which go  seriously  to affect Mr Shore's administration and they  offered  evidence upon them to the Lords"  It is true that  Mr Burke  did open such facts as he calls them but in the first  place he acted without authority in opening themand secondly the facts or by far the greater number of them  were not true  and thirdly Sir John Shore cannot be responsible for such facts as were true in any possible point of view He certainly  did  reflect very  seriously  upon the character and conduct of Sir John Shore but in so doing  he exceeded his powers  and it was neither more nor less than the groundless calumny of an unauthorized individual  To prevent therefore  all further misrepresentations  we now publish  those facts of a very strong nature  which Mr Burke  opened  and we print them from minutes taken at the time by a shorthand writer There may still be some errors owing to the rapidity of Mr Burke's utterance but they cannot materially affect his argument those who have read Mr Dodsley's abstract in his Register will find how clearly both accounts agree in all essential points  If Mr Burke's doctrine were to prevail what would be Mr Pitt's situation A Manager on an India Impeachment has but to select all the meritorious servants of the public and if he can like Mr Burke call names with the fluency of a Marat or a Parisian Poissarde he may apply the epithet  Creature  to one man  Secret Agent  to a second  Bribe Broker  to a third  Murderer  to a fourth  Corrupt Instrument  to a fifth  Captain General of Iniquity  to a sixth  Villain  to a seventh and so on until he forces Mr Pitt to have recourse to the Ranks of Opposition for a Governor General  Many years ago Mr Burke played the same game though he then acted by authorityAs soon as the Rockingham Administration were in power he drew out a Parliamentary Report  In  in which he most violently attacked the Directors for appointing Sir John Macpherson and Mr Stables to the Supreme  Council and the Hon Mr Stuart and Mr Sulivan to a succession upon vacancies  He imputed to Sir John Macpherson a design to support the Nabob of Arcot by bribing the King's Ministers and Parliament itself Mr Stables was an improper person because he had not been in the Civil Service Mr Stuart was an accused man and Mr Sulivan was the son of the Chairman  As Mr Burke however has once more thought proper to allude  "to the offences opened by the Managers"  that is  by himself  the story shall be told in intelligible language  The Managers knew nothing of this story until Mr Burke told it in Westminster Hall and he himself only got the hint of it from Mr Francis two days before the trial commenced    The day after he had concluded his account  of those offences  the late Lord Chancellor  for the trial after surviving almost a hundred of its Judges has now outlived the President of the Court stated in the House of Lords  "that the new matter introduced by Mr Burke in his opening speech was of such a nature that compared with it the articles important as they were  sunk to utter insignificance  and that Mr Burke would be a  calumniator  if he did not put it into such a form as might enable Mr Hastings to refute it if he could not refute it then no punishment in the power of their Lordships to inflict could be adequate to his offences"  The Duke of Richmond took the same line and added the epithet "base" to that of calumniator  Of these speeches Mr Burke took no notice In the next year Mr Burke in one of his rants called Mr Hastings "a Murderer" Mr Hastings complained  to the House of Commons next day of this scandalous outrage he complained also of the introduction of the story of Deby Sing in the preceding year and he prayed the House to frame both accusations into articles if  they  thought there were grounds to do so if not to redress the injury which he had sustained  The House censured Mr Burke for the first offence against decency and justice but they rejected the second complaint not because it was  unfounded  but because Mr Hastings had not complained of the injury as soon as he received it  Mr Burke affirmed  upon this occasion  that he was  determined  to go into this story of Deby SingThe year passed over  and he did nothing    In the next year  On the th of May    evidence  was offered upon it as he tells the Chairman but however in such a manner we will venture  to say as no  lawyer  could have advised for instead of going to the House of Commons and there stating  the grounds  for implicating Mr Hastings in any transactions of Deby Sing as a foundation for an additional article either Mr Burke or Mr Anstruther called for an opinion delivered by Mr Hastings in January in which he says  "that he so well knows the character and abilities of Rajah Deby Sing as easily to conceive it was in his power to commit the enormities laid to his charge and to conceal the ground of them from the English Resident Mr Goodlad"  Upon this opinion the Managers said  "they would next proceed to shew what those enormities were which might be concealed from the English gentlemen residing there and which might be committed without their knowing any thing of the matter"  This miserable attempt was instantly opposed by the Counsel of Mr Hastings who at the same time pressed Mr Burke to go to the Commons and if he could persuade  them  to accuse Mr Hastings they would most eagerly and gladly meet the accusation but they would neither allow Mr Burke to make charges of  his own authority  nor permit him to adduce evidence upon charges so made  The opinion of the Lords was called for and they  instantly  determined  "That it is  not  competent for the Managers for the Commons to give evidence of the enormities actually committed by Deby Sing  the same not being charged in the Impeachment  Printed evidence page  "  A rational man would have supposed that after such a decision Mr Burke would have done one of two thingseither that which his  character  and his  honour  required namely to bring the subject  fully before the last House of Commons  or to have been silent for ever He did not adopt the first and best measure nay as it respects  Mr Hastings  he has totally dropped it but as soon as his Majesty had honoured Sir John Shore by his favour and when the King's Ministers had selected him  "for an office of the highest trust and the highest possible power"  then Mr Burke revived this story of Deby Sing in his letter to the Chairman in order to make an impression  against Sir John Shore  To rescue  his character  therefore from the calumnies of Mr Burketo rescue the character of the British nation in India from the reproach which Mr Burke has so unjustly cast upon it we have printed his speech and we have added explanatory notes in order to prove that no one English gentleman can be responsible for the conduct of Deby Sing  It has been rumoured in the vicinity of St James's that Mr Burke has complained  of Sir John Shore's appointment to Mr Dundas in very strong terms To this worthy gentleman his complaints are not improperly addressed In return for Mr Burke's important services to Ministers he might have expected a continuance of that cordial support which Mr Dundas has hitherto given him in carrying on the impeachment  Mr Burke may have addressed Mr Dundas with great propriety in the following terms To support you in office I have given up character principle and consistency No very long period has elapsed since I affirmed in the face of the House of Commons and of my country  "That all the acts and monuments in the records of peculation the consolidated corruption of ages the patterns of exemplary plunder in the heroic times of Roman iniquity never equalled the gigantic corruption of a single act"  conceived and executed by you and  Mr Pitt I solemnly pledged myself to be  "a steady earnest and faithful assistant to any one who should bring forward any plan that might tend to a subversion of that most  corrupt  and  oppressive  system for the government of India  The passages marked by inverted commas are taken from the speeches printed by Mr Burke himself  "  which you and Mr Pitt have established under the sanction of Parliament but so completely was I  "  neutralized  and  dulcified  "  by your support of the impeachment that I have now  forgot  all my former speeches though I printed them publicly and though Mr Dodsley has very lately sent a fresh edition of them into the world  The system which I censured so loudly is still continued in all its parts but I have  long since  ceased to sound the trumpet of alarm and you may violate Treaties you may disgrace the honour of Great  Britain in short you  might  have done  any thing  provided you had given me all the money and all the time and all the influence I wanted to carry on the impeachment But it was not enough that I ceased to be your determined and persevering opponent I have lately rendered you most essential services I have lost no opportunity of exposing the weakness of that party to whose interests my best days were devoted I have used every means in my power to scatter them to atoms I have so far  succeeded  that the  people  now believe there is hardly one honest public man in this nation I have supported your Proclamation I have excited the fears of the Aristocratic Whigs and I have made the Houses of Wentworth Cavendish and Bentinck your own  In return for these important services you have disgraced me in the opinion of  every man of honour in the nation You ought to have remembered the high tone which I affected when I originally moved the Impeachment of Mr Hastings I did not venture at once to accuse him of spending half a million improvidently in thirteen years while he added millions to the public resourceswith all the extravagance of the American war before their eyes with the pensions sinecure places and Peerages so lavishly bestowed by Ministers of late years open to their view the Country Gentlemen would have scouted every idea of a criminal prosecution upon so contemptible charge I therefore played a deeper and a more artful partI began by telling them that provinces once most flourishing Mr Hastings had desolatedthat countries once eminently peopled were now inhabited only by beasts of preythat institutions sacred in the opinions of nations he had publicly  violatedthat commerce he had destroyed and that the revenues by his mismanagement had greatly declined The Country Gentlemen believed me and they voted with me My work from this time was easy in the House but out of doors your annual budget in which you so pointedly contradicted all my statements hurt my reputation considerably and as if that were not enough you have now taken a step which has  ruined me  and will materially injure  you  Had you  no recollection  of the evidence which  the new Baronet  gave in Westminster Hall The man whom  you  have made Governor General has sworn that from to including every year of Mr Hasting's administration Bengal had progressively  improved  in agriculture and  population  that the natives were  happier  and their property  better protected in that period  than under their own sovereigns and that  of Mr Hastings  they entertained  a very favourable opinion  How can I affirm hereafter that Mr Hastings was a tyrant an oppressor a murderer a captaingeneral of iniquity or that India on his departure from it felt relieved from a weight under which she had long groaned It will be said to me if the solemn testimony of a man whom  your gracious sovereign delighteth to honour  and whom his confidential servants have appointed Governor General of India is to be believed you Mr Burke have been imposing upon and deceiving us What answer can I make unless I am ready to pronounce that next to that act which I so violently censured a few years ago this appointment of Sir John Shore is  "the most gigantic instance of corruption"  ever committed in the world  But though you and Mr Pitt had no  consideration  for me  you might have been alarmed  for yourselves  Though it be true that you differed most widely from me as to the state of Bengal and when I declared it to be ruined irretrievably you pronounced it to be most  flourishing  and  prosperous  yet it is equally true that you  ultimately voted  with me and you have paid the Solicitors bill for very heavy charges incurred by my orders in an attempt to prove  legally  what  you  have publickly declared to be utterly  unfounded in truth    You ought to have recollected that since this most unhappy business in France the people of England have had the insolence to think and to speak what they think with much more freedom than formerly There is no longer a blind reverence paid to great names or to great authoritiesRemember my words in Parliament prophetic they were and the prediction is almost accomplished  I said that in this impeachment of Mr Hastings  "Infamy must necessarily rest somewhere"  It will not be from me alone that the public will ask how it happens that sixty thousand pounds of their money has been expended that the first principle of Magna Charta has been violated by the extension of a criminal trial to a period unknown  in former times  and which no man could have suspected would have happened  at any time  They will say that you have proved your disbelief of the  foundation  of this impeachment by preferring a man who has destroyed  that foundation  by his evidence or they will take up the argument in my letter to the Chairman and totally condemn the appointment so that in either case  you  cannot escape the censure of the publicand was this a time to turn politics into farce The mysteries of Government should be concealed from the too prying eyes of the swinish multitude I have  in my time  been guilty of great indiscretions but I have repented and have made every reparation in my power The time was when I affirmed and took care to let the whole world know  "that Kings  Mr Burke's speech on the Reform February  were naturally lovers of low company"  The time was when I censured the University of Oxford for its unconstitutional address to the Throne  In May on the American war  The time was when I complimented the republican Thomas Paine as the great and successful champion of American independence  Mr Burke's letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol in  The time was when I gloried in my correspondence with good Dr Francklin  Mr Burke's speech in December  though the law pronounced him a rebel and declared such correspondence to be illegal The time was when the King's friends were disgusted by certain intemperate words which fell from me during  his indisposition but I am now the avowed champion of monarchy of the church and of aristocracy throughout the world Indeed my dear friend you have acted inconsiderately to give no harsher term to your conduct This was not a time to expose me or to risque your own situation What conclusion can sober and thinking men come to They will say that Mr Hastings having been made as you well know the ladder by which Mr Pitt and yourself climbed to power you took the first opportunity to shew  ministerial gratitude  for favours conferred They will say that  my old friends  having lost  their situations  by attacking that man felt a resentment which is  venial  at least and that they have acted under the influence of that resentment Of myself they will say that my enquiries have been so very deep that I must have known the true state of India to be as  you  have described it in the House of Commons In short when  they consider that no one person whom we have represented as having been injured by Mr Hastings has been redressed by you or Mr Pittthat no one  resource  which Mr Hastings procured has been  abandoned  by governmentthat no one system which  he  framed has been altered essentially  by you  that the man  Sir John Shore  whom I described as having entered into a corrupt collusion with another person whom I painted as the most execrable of villains  Deby Sing  has been selected by you for the government of Bengalthat this man so selected was for many years the principal Manager of the Revenues under Mr Hastings and has borne testimony to the prosperous condition of Bengal the happiness of its inhabitants and their regard for Mr Hastings When they consider that the credit of the two great parties of England and of the last Parliament is implicated in the decision of the impeachment and that with all the  influence and all the money employed in more than five years we have not been able to procure  one solitary individual  to prefer a complaint against Mr Hastings  from India  but on the contrary have received the most  damning proofs  of the respect and veneration in which the natives of India hold this persecuted man what will be the conclusion what can be the conclusion which the people will draw It must be this that we have been actuated by private motives in thus persisting in error and ought to be responsible to our country for so unprecedented a protraction of a criminal trial  Mr Burke might well express these sentiments to Mr Dundas He has favoured his late FellowManagers with a copy of his letter to the Chairman and it would be  to their edification  if he would  also  give them the contents of his letter to Mr Dundas  THE END  Mr BURKE's SPEECH c c  DINAGEPORE my Lords is a countrypretty nearly as large as all Yorkshire together and has a prince at the head called the Rajah or Zemindar of Dinagepore I find that about July  He died in April and his adopted son was on the th of June ordered to succeed to the zemindary by an unanimous vote of the board Messrs Hastings Francis and Wheler  the Rajah died leaving a half brother and a son A litigation instantly arose in the family and this litigation was intirely to be referred and it must finally be decided by the Governor General and Council being the ultimate authority  for all the revenue questions there and they were to proceed on the opinion of the register in their decision It came before Mr Hastings and I find he  That is the whole Board  decided the question in favour of Sudernand Sing son of the Rajah against his half brother I find on that decision a rent settled and a fine paid so that all this transaction is fair and above board and I find along with it many extraordinary acts for I find that Mr Hastings took a part in favour of the minister Hyderbeg agreeable to the principles of others and contrary to his own and on his establishing the authority of the minister Hyderbeg I find he gave the guardianship of this son to the brother of the Rajah as he is called the brother of the wife of the late Rajah deceased and when the steward of the province was coming down to represent his case to Mr Hastings Mr Hastings  The whole Board  not only sent him back so far from hearing him fully but he ordered him actually to be turned out of his office to bring in another that could only increase the family dissension  I find he has taken a sum of Â£ in for this account seems to begin in July or somewhere thereabouts and to the same period in there was a regular payment so that if it refers to the money paid to him from the Rajah it is a sum of money corruptly taken by him As judge he receives it for judgment but whether the judgment be right or wrong true or false he corruptly receives the sum of Â£ for that judgment  This assertion could not be true because this money began to be received on the th of August eight months before the death of the old Rajah and as appears by the managers' evidence was principally paid in the year  he received it you will observe through Gunga Govind Sing who was the broker of agreements he was the person that was to receive it by monthly instalments and to pay it to Mr Hastings Gunga Govind Sing's son had in his hand all the papers and documents so that Mr Hastings takes a bribe from an infant of five or six years old through the hands of the register whose opinion was to have the whole weight in settling the judgment This was not a public tribute or fine so that in fact  through the register of the country the keeper of the records he receives a bribe from a family in point of judgment in disinheriting the brother I do not say whether it was proper or not I know these questions of adoption are the most curious in the Gentoo law this I know he succeeded for a bribe through a man who was in the office of record this I contend and I find very soon other parties concerned  My Lords I found very soon after this that the man who gave it and all the officers under him were turned out of their employments by Gunga Govind Sing My Lords we find them all accused without any appearance or trace upon record of the mismanagement of his affairs and accordingly to prevent the relations of his adopted mother to prevent those who might be supposed to have interest in the family from abusing him in the trust of his affairs and management of his fortune Gunga Govind Sing for I hope you will not suffer me if I had a mind to name that tool of a thing called the Committee of Â£ a year Gunga Govind  Sing I will do him justice to say that if he had known that there was another man more accomplished in all iniquity than Gunga Govind Sing Mr Hastings would have given him the first place in his confidence turns them all out of office but then there was another next to him a person called Deby Sing he ranked under Gunga Govind Sing This man although he had in former transactions in Purnea for sook the very shape rules and names of virtue yet Mr Hastings is to acquit him of thisthey were reconciled on this occasion Deby Sing came into office superseding all the othersThere is an English gentleman one Mr Goodlad whom you will hear of presently they appointed him and the first act they do is cut off Â£ a month from the Rajah's allowance because he is stated to be extravagant and to have a great number of dependants to maintain in short there is such a flutter and bustle there never was such a tender guardianship and superintendance as Deby Sing uses  always with the knowledge of Mr Hastings  to this poor Rajah who had just given Â£ if he did give Â£ for his inheritance to Mr Hastings but probably because that money could not  come out of the surplus of his affairs Mr Goodlad had taken Â£ a month from his establishments which will go very handsomely to the payment of any private fine but Mr Hastings should at least have examined before they were turned out whether it was proper or no Now they are turned out and when I come to enquire I do not find that the new guardians have brought to account one shilling of the money they received there is not a single shadow no not one word to be found in the accounts of Deby Sing and Mr Goodlad They first put Deby Sing in possession of the Rajah's family and the management of it and the very next step in the course of one year is to give him the farming of the whole receipt of these three provinces  Mr Burke makes an important mistake hereDeby Sing took the farm of Dinagepore in May In September Mr Shore entered a minute on the Committee Proceedings stating the enormous expences of the Zemindar of Dinagepore an infant of six years of age and recommending a reduction of those expences In consequence of this minute Deby Sing and Mr Goodlad had the superintendence of the family Mr Hastings had  been three months absent from Calcutta  at this time and did not return until February  If the  Peshcush  was not received  as a bribe for the nomination of the Rajah it was received as a bribe for office Which is the best or the worst I shall not pretend to determine or whether Mr Hastings got it from Deby Sing for appointing him guardian or for the judgment but you find the Rajah in his possession you find his house and education in his possession this makes it necessary you should know that after committing the family of the Rajah to him he accepted the proposals Deby Sing made in the name of his son  "and" say the Committee "his abilities and indefatigable attention to business are so well known that we trust the measure will meet with your approbation c  This is a quotation from a letter written by Mr Shore to the Governor General and Council in the month of November in which he relates the measures taken by the Committee of Revenue for letting the lands of Bengal It appears by that letter that the Zemindar of Dinagepore being a minor the Committee had farmed the province to Deby Sing upon this principle only that he had offered what they thought the best terms for the Company and being a man whom Mr Shore had well known from his intimacy with Mr Ducarell and by Deby Sing's having been employed under Mr Shore himself for many years at Moorshedabad he gives him that fair character which he conceived him to merit It was in that Deby Sing was accused of malpractices during the famine of and in he was acquitted chiefly on the testimony of Mr Ducarell  "  Here is an acknowledgment of his fidelity and that he is a person to  whom no objection can be made This present to Mr Hastings is by him recorded and sent to the East India Company Mr Hastings has recorded though he publicly authorised Deby Sing's nomination to this great body of power that he knew Deby Sing to be a man against whom the most atrocious iniquities were charged that were ever charged upon man Now though it is a large field and though it is a thing that I feel reluctance in mentioning exhausted as I am at present yet such is the magnitude of the subject such the hurtful consequences of superseding all persons to give the country into the hands of Gunga Govind Sing and Deby Sing that I will proceed It is not a subject for me perhaps to go into unless I can prove to you that Mr Hastings knew  the man and that he has avowed his knowledge of him though he accepts him as a man against whom no possible objection could be made  It is necessary to state to you who was this Deby Sing to whom these great trusts were appointed and profits given Deby Sing was a person of the tribe of Banyans that is to say the trading and merchant class of India and he was practised in all those little arts and frauds to get money and was successful He was employed by Mahomed Reza Cawn while that great man had the management of all the affairs of state and revenue in his hands under the Company Deby Sing paid his court to him with all the assiduity and subtilness which those who have no principle are very apt to use When M R Cawn was brought down by Mr Hastings and ordered on a strange charge to Calcutta  It is a singular fact that as often as people in power in England have had a wish to carry a point against the East India Company they have had recourse to the foulest calumnies Mr Burke here does justice to Mahomed Reza Cawn but in when Lord North and his friends made Mr Hastings  the single exception  to the universal abuse bestowed upon the servants of the Company Colonel Dow wrote a book in which there is the following passage reflecting upon Mahomed Reza Cawn  "Year after year brought new tyrants or confirmed the old in the practice of their former oppression The tenants being at length ruined the farmers were unable to make good their contract with government Their cruelties to those in prison recoiled at length on themselves Many of them were bound to stakes and whipped but their poverty ceased to be feigned Their complaints were heard in every square of Moorshedabad  and not a few of them expired in agonies under the lash  "  In at the distance of ten years when  another attack  was made upon the Company a similar unjustifiable calumny was repeated by Mr Burke Mahomed Reza Cawn no longer in power under the British government had  recovered  his character but  our administration  in India was as bad as ever  "Were we to be driven out of India this day said Mr Burke in nothing would remain to tell that it had been possessed during the inglorious period of our dominion by any thing better than the Ourang Outang or the Tiger"    Deby Sing lent him considerable sums of money for this great man was accused of great crimes and acquitted Â£ in debt that is to say as soon as he was a  great debtor he ceased to be a great criminal Deby Sing obtained his interest and one of the first great concerns intrusted to him was the province of Purnea how did he shew himself there he so well acquitted himself in that place that the province was totally ruined and desolated To give you an idea of this the revenue that in one year was Â£ fell the next year to Â£ and he so completely dried up all the source of the revenue that it produced not equal to half of what it had been originally let at Now when the farmers who were Calcutta Banyans looked at the province in which they hoped to make their fortunes they suddenly fled from it and gave Â£ to be rid of the bargain The corruptions and oppressions were too abominable to escape notice and accordingly this man was removed from his employment in but not from his profits which he kept  This alludes to a transaction which happened immediately after Mr Hastings came to Bengal in Deby Sing had managed the province of Purnea when it was superintended by Mr Ducarell A complaint was preferred against him to Mr Hastings in who ordered him under a guard to Moorshedabad After a full enquiry the complaint was proved to be illfounded and Mr Ducarell of whom Mr Fox spoke in such high terms of praise was the principal evidence to prove his innocence and his meritMr Burke knows this just as well as the editor does  Stigmatized but still in power he  obtains the office of high Duan  Deby Sing was appointed Duan to the provincial council of Moorshedabad and Mr Shore Persian translator to that council in November the former continued in this office until the abolition of the provincial council in February Mr Burke so confounds dates and places that it is necessary to explain what he leaves so obscure  or deputy steward of the great province the capital of the country in short the whole power of Duan fell into his hands  The council consisted of young men not like other young men of pleasurable dispositions but like young men in India willing to possess pleasure and the means of acquiring a good fortune by the effects of ruin Deby Sing took compassion upon them  and endeavoured to lead them to the ways of property and pleasure There is a tax in that country much more productive than honourablea tax on public prostitutes which Deby Sing imposed and with that ability for which he has been so much commended he selected those who had the greatest personal merit the ladies were called Pearl of Price Ruby of Pure Blood c c c c all those fine names that heightened the general harmony and increased the vivid satisfactions of love with all the allurements of avarice and Deby Sing made frequent visits to the young gentlemenHe carried this moving seraglio about with him wherever he went and he supplied his guests liberally with the best wines of France and exquisite entertainment with the Indian perfumes and every thing that tends to increase the luxuries of such a scene This great magician amongst them chaste in the middle of dissoluteness sober in the midst of drunkenness and active in the lap of drowsiness brought these young men such papers to sign as in a sober hour never could have been given and  accordingly he conveyed to himself such grants as never could have been made otherwise  We can take upon us to affirm that the whole of this account is a fable This provincial council consisted of some of the ablest servants ever employed in the revenue line in Bengal On its first formation the second member of the government was the chief Mr Baber the second Mr Maxwell third Mr Hosea fourth and Mr Hogarth fifth some of those were succeeded by Mr Cowper now a member of the supreme council Mr David Anderson whose merits are generally known Mr Moore Mr Foley and others but not one of that loose and detestable character described by Mr Burke  This keeper of brothels is the man that was chosen by Mr Hastings as a proper man to superintend the young Rajah to lead him in the path of all piety and virtue Deby Sing knew that pleasure would not do alone and he supplied pleasure under that species of entertainments which he knew very well how to manage but it would not have done if he had not done something also for their necessitites and accordingly he got the sole and regular government he got several provinces under various names sometimes appearing in his own name sometimes disappearing  and shrouding himself under others as successful or detected villany gave him countenance or made him timid  Not one trace of such transactions in the province of Moorshedabad as Mr Burke relates is to be found  My Lords in this new case every situation was a new bribe he oppressed the people and in one of them he publicly acted by proxy As for the farm at Dinagepore he was given it with great apparent consideration he was given it at an advanced rent but he was to take care it should not be levied with any new contribution and he was sent by Mr Hastings  This is a very unfounded statementDeby Sing got the farm of Dinagepore from the Committee of Revenue in May after much consideration upon no other ground than this that his terms were upon comparison with other proposals the most advantageous to Government and the same for the other two provincesThe acts of the Committee were confirmed by the Governor General and Council  to govern these three great countries of Dinagepore Rungpore and Edaracpore He did not lose a moment If you can forget his character you may easily believe that  Deby Sing had not a more correct memory The first thing he did  This charge on the public investigation was dispovedMr Burke states this and all that follow as if they had been facts proved by evidence  was to seize on all the gentlemen of that country throw them all in prison keep them in irons and oblige them to sign a paper for the increase of their rents  This also was disproved    The next step he took was to lay on them a number of new taxes which by his covenants he was not to have laid those taxes amounted to as much as the increased rent of the landed gentry and freeholders of the country Being thus in imprisonment obliged to sign those bonds and loaded with taxes they became totally unable to pay the next step was to seize on and sequester the lands those that pay no taxes are the demesne lands for themselves and their families and those that pay rents are those that wish to maintain an independance These demesne lands were sold for one year's purchase  the price there is ten years  It was proved that the lands sold which were very inconsiderable in their value were sold at a fair price Deby Sing was compelled to restore them and to lose the purchase money because he had acted without the permission of Government in making the purchases  Who were they sold to You are ready to anticipate me they were sold to Deby Sing himself through one of his agents they amounted in all to the amount of Â£ sterling a year  We should imagine there must be a mistake here as the lands sold did not amount to seventy thousand rupees a year and the Governor General and Council compelled Deby Sing to restore them all The price of lands in Bengal is two and not ten years purchase The whole rent of Rungpore was not more than Â£ a year  but according to the value of money in that country they were worth very considerable sums but were sequestered and purchased so much under their proper rate that the fee simple of an acre of land sold for about seven or eight shillings and the miserable wretches received the payment for the lands out of the money that was collected from them The money was  put into a separate collection and the moment it was paid the rents were raised again and the produce was reserved as a sacred deposit for himself or some other person whom Mr Hastings should appoint  There was no accusation of this sort made  The next was the sale of the goods they were obliged to carry them to market and there is one circumstance that will especially call for your pity Most of the persons who are principal landholders or Zemindars happened at that time to be women The sex  there  are in a state of imprisonment but by their sanctity they are treated with all possible attention and respect No hand of the law can touch them but they have a custom of sending family bailiffs and family serjeants into their houses and accordingly such persons came into their houses and became masters of them the men and women all fled all the charity lands were sold at the same market But this is not all there were things yet dearer to them the poor consolations of imagination at death for all the substantial miseries of life There were lands set apart for their funeral service how dear they were to all  the people of India I hope you will know on further enquiry But this tyranny of Deby Sing more consuming than fire more greedy than the grave seized these lands also and sold indeed almost all the Zemindars possessions Their houses were burnt their carts were broken up These things are to come in proof  This was  impossible  until the matter should be first charged in the House of Commons that House whose Delegate Mr Burke was  never heard a word of this story    This was the manner in which all the principal gentry all the secondary gentry all the women and all the minors were disposed of What was the situation of the poor men of the yeomen I say their situation is ten thousand times worse if possible if there are degrees of degradation in utter ruin They were driven like horned cattle into the common prison and there they were obliged to sign as the principal Zemindars had done before they were obliged to sign recognitions to their utter ruin they were let out only to their destruction There were such an incredible variety of new taxes imposed every day that they were obliged to sell almost all the corn  of the country at once It happening to be a year of fulness and the markets overloaded their crops did not sell for above onefourth of the value so that being overloaded with taxes they came to the next resource they were obliged to sell every where and hurry to market all the cattle those cattle that were worth s or s apiece five of them were known to sell for s The next thing that they were to part with was the ornaments of the women They were obliged to be parted with They do not decorate themselves according to our mode but their decoration was a resource upon emergency and if they have got any gold it may serve for assistance They were all forced to be brought to market along with the cattle so that gold and silver sold for per cent under its value But some will say gold and silver sold under its value certainly where there is an overloaded market and wicked purchasers  Permit me my Lords to set before you the state of the people that remain the victims of this oppression What you are going to hear is an answer from the author Deby  Sing who being charged with this compulsory sale of the lands says  "It is notorious that poverty generally prevails among the husbandmen and the poor are seldom possessed of any substance except at the time they reap their harvest and this is the case that such numbers of them were swept away by famine their effects were only a little earthenware and their houses a handful of straw the sale of which was not worth a few rupeesbut it is still incredible that there should not be a want of purchasers"  My Lords I produce this strange testimomy from the person himself who was concerned in racking these people and I produce it to shew the state of the country It is not bribes of Â£ only Those who give these bribes of Â£ must receive four times that sum The people while they were harassed in this manner sought that dreadful resource that misery is apt to fly tothey fell into the hands of usurers Usurers are a bad resource at any time those usurers to the hardness of that kind of description of people added another that makes men ten times  worse that is their own necessity They had very little help against the oppression of power they were obliged to pay to answer the bribes and gifts given to Mr Hastings not or per centno such thing per cent by the year beggaring the people therefore was the only resource Such is the consequence of briberyThe poor unfortunate people in this way stript of every thing land and cattle their ininstruments of husbandry next go to market after that the persons attending them dragged them from their own miserable hovels and their last homes were burnt to the ground It was not the exaction of revenue it was a cruel robbery and there remained to the unhappy people of that country but two things their families and their friends Men generally console themselves with a satisfaction in proportion as they are deprived of other advantages that they still find a resource at home but the most tender of parents the most affectionate and tender husbands could not console themselves with their children or their wives This was the case of the country in respect of their penury  I am obliged to make use of some apology for the horrid scene I am now going to open My Lords you have already had enough more than enough of oppressions upon poverty and oppressions upon propertyAnd my Lords permit me to make the apology to you that Mr Paterson made a man that I wish if ever my name should be mentioned to posterity may go down along with his if possible though in a secondary degree  It will naturally be supposed that this story of Mr Burke's made a considerable noise in Calcutta Mr Paterson who is a man of honour and character was by no means inclined to sacrifice truth in return for Mr Burke's eulogium but wrote the following Letter to Mr Chapman a Member of the Board of Revenue inclosing in it a statement of facts which proved that Mr Hastings was absent from Calcutta during the course of the inquiry into the conduct of Deby Sing though he was the  first  to order its commencement and to turn Deby Sing out of all his employments pending the inquiry  "DEAR CHAPMAN  "IT was with sincere concern that I saw my Reports on the Rungpore insurrection produced as a charge against Mr Hastings How little he had to do in this business you will see from the inclosed statement of facts You will find  that as far as rested with him  his conduct was such as you would expect  from a man of his humanity I have no party interest to serve  but it must give you satisfaction to see a vindication of Mr Hastings from one who has  no other motive  for the step  than that of justice    Yours c J PATERSON  CALCUTTA  Sep  Charles Chapman Esq  This Letter and the statement inclosed in it are amongst the Records at the India House    His apology is this it is mine  "that the punishments inflicted upon the Ryots of Rungpore and Dinagepore were in many instances of such nature that I would rather wish to draw a veil over them than shock your feelings by a detail but it is substantially necessary for the sake of justice and humanity and the honour of Government that they should be exposed to be remembered in future"  My Lords let this be my anticipating apology It is indeed a most disgraceful scene to human nature that I am now going to mention When the people were stript of every thing it was in some cases suspected  and justly that they had hid some part of their grain Their bodies were then applied to the fiercest mode of torture which was this they began with them by winding cords about their fingers there they clung and were incorporated together then they hammered wedges of wood and iron between their fingers till they  The cruelties mentioned in this part of Mr Burke's speech were charged to have been committed in a small district called Dhee Jumla dependent upon Dinagepore No complaints were made from any other part of Dinagepore The first accusation turned out to be false after a solemn enquiry upon oath  crushed and maimed those honest and laborious hands which never were lifted to their mouths but with a scanty supply of provision these were the hands so tortured out of which you have purchased a substance which has furnished this country with the entertainment of china a substance drawn from themselves and their children of which you and all this auditory and all this company have made that very luxurious meal without a farthing expence to Great Britain for years What was the return Cords hammers  tortures and maiming was the return This is the situation in which those hands were bound which act with resistless power when they are lifted up to heaven powerful in prayer against the authors of such confusion Let us at least deprecate and secure  ourselves from the vengeance due to those who massacred them Let us for God's sake it is a serious thought They begun there but if they begun there there they did not stop The heads of the villages the leading yeomen of the country respectable for their virtue and age were tied together two and two unoffending and thus helpless they were then thrown over a bar and beat with bamboo canes on the soles of their feet 'till their nails started from their toes and were afterwards so beaten with cudgels that their blood ran both from their noses eyes and ears  This charge was also proved to be false after the fullest investigation    My Lords they did not stop there bamboos wangees rattans canes commonwhips and scourges were not sufficient They  found a tree in the country which bears strong and sharp thorns Not satisfied with those other cruelties they scourged them with that Not satisfied with this but searching every thing through the deepest parts of nature where she seems to have forgot her usual benevolence they found a poisonous plant which is a deadly caustic which inflames the bruised part and often ends with death This they applied to those wounds My Lords this we know that there are men so made that even the pains of the body fortify the sufferer to bear the pains of the mind The mind strengthens as the body suffers and rises with an elastic force against those that torture it The mind gets the better of the body Those people that are dealt with in this manner people that can bear their own tortures cannot bear those of their children and friends The innocent children were brought and scourged before the face of their parents cruelly scourged before their parents  After a very full enquiry this charge was found to be false    They bound the father and the son face to face arm to arm body to body and in that state they whipt them with every refinement of cruelty so that every blow which escaped the father should fall upon the son and every blow which escaped the son should fall upon the father so that where they did not wound the sense they should wound and tear the sensibilities of nature This was not all Virgins that were kept from the sight of sun were dragged into the public court which should be a refuge against all oppression and there in the presence of the day their delicacies were offended and their virginity cruelly violated by the basest and cruellest of mankind  Not a syllable of this charge was true  It did not end there The wives of the men of the country only suffered less by this they lost their honour in the bottom of the most cruel dungeons where they were confined  This charge and the next also proved totally false  These are wrongs to the people wrongs to their manners wrongs to their bodies and the feelings of mankind they were dragged out naked in  that situation exposed to public view and scourged before all the people  My Lords here is my authority  The authority thus quoted by Mr Burke was a translation of a complaint delivered to Mr Paterson and by him transmitted just as he received it to the Board of Revenue There was an  art  practised by Mr Burke in this instance of which we hope  no other man in England is capable  How could the Lords or the auditors have supposed that all Mr Burke's  authority  was an allegation not enquired into  for otherwise you will not believe it credible My Lords what will you feel when I tell you that they put the nipples of the women into the clift notches of sharp bamboos and tore them from their bodies  The horror which this accusation excited in Bengal induced the Commissioners to make the most strict enquiry into the truth of it and it appeared that it was utterly unfounded  They applied burning torches and cruel slow fire to their bodies  My Lords I am ashamed to open it these infernal fiends in defiance of every thing divine and human plunged torches  into the source of life  This charge excited equal horror but on the fullest enquiry it was proved to have been made without the smallest foundation  My Lords this excites feelings that modesty which more distinguishes man than even his rational nature bids us turn from the view of and leave it to those infernal fiends to execute their cruel and diabolical tortures where the modesty of nature and the anxieties of parents may not follow them These are cruelties that arose from the giving power to such a man as Deby Sing and his infernal villains  My Lords I had forgot I have it here the manner in which you may know the length the breadth and depth of these horrible cruelties They took these unfortunate husbandmen whom they had imprisoned they whipt them I assure you these details are not pleasant but they are useful These men were taken often out of prison awoke from their sleep and these tormentors watched for the moments when  nature takes refuge from life in a state of insensibility they were awoke to be whipped  Of this charge no shadow of proof appears Nor can I even find that such a charge was preferred to Mr Paterson or any other living  again next morning in winter time when the country was quite destroyed by frost which to them is more terrible than to us They were plunged into cold water then led out into the villages to see if they could raise any thing from the hands of the villagers  My Lords the people of India are patience itself their patience is too criminal but they burst at once into a wild and universal uproar and unarmed rebellion from one end to another The two provinces  This is not a true statement The fact is that  Dinagepore  never broke out into rebellion That province paid a revenue of Â£ a year and the balance of the first year of Deby Sing's lease was not and the second not Â£The insurrection broke out in  Rungpore  only  broke out into general rebellion The people fell  as most commonly happens on those less guilty and murdered them they destroyed the subordinate instruments of tyranny then followed Mr Goodlad who had  been a patient witness  of all these things  This is a most cruel and unjustifiable attack upon a gentleman of irreproachable character who fills an important office in Bengal Mr Goodlad was the Collecter of Rungpore when the rebellion broke out but he never received a single complaint that he did not instantly redress  Having finished our remarks upon Mr Burke's statement of the cruelties we earnestly call our readers attention to the following opinion of Sir John Shore recorded by him when judgment was pronounced upon Deby Sing in November  "I cannot conclude without an additional remark that there never was a cause which appears to have been more thoroughly investigated or more impartially conducted Every member of the existing government at the time  Messirs Hastings Wheler Macpherson and Stables  it is notorious had formed a decisive opinion against Deby Sing in consequence of Mr Paterson's reports and the measures adopted were conformable to those sentiments and calculated to shew that if proved guilty he had no mercy to expect It was under this decided and avowed disapprobation of Government that the Commissioners reluctantly undertook an investigation of this cause Their proceedings in my opinion do equal credit to their integrity and to their understandings Facts are not left to bare assertion for support Every charge and some not specifically pointed out to the Commissioners is examined with scrupulous accuracy and wherever evidence could be obtained it has been sought for and brought forward The proceedings are not summary but voluminous and minute and if the conduct of any Zemindar or farmer in the country were to pass an investigation of the same nature I may venture to assert that he would not be deemed innocent"  "The transactions in Dhee Jumla  Where the atrocious cruelties stated by Mr Burke were said to have been committed  being wholly unconnected with the proceedings in Rungpore I have followed the example of the Commissioners in considering them separately Their report is so full clear and decisive that I shall content myself with referring to that in support of my opinion which is that Deby Sing so far from being culpable in any instance alleged against him appears to have been moderate in his demands for rent attentive to the complaints preferred and to have punished the persons proved to have oppressed the Ryots on their complaints  I am happy also to remark that many of the worst accusations preferred against him appear to have had no existence whatever  "  Signed J SHORE  Though Sir John Shore acquits Deby Sing of having had any share in such acts of cruelty as were really committed in Dhee Jumla while he states also that many of the worst accusations were utterly unfounded yet the conduct of Deby Sing in  Rungpore  did not escape his censure at the same time he thought it but justice to remark that the actual guilt of Deby Sing bore no sort of proportion to the magnitude of the charges preferred against him  To say no more he was a patient witness of the rebellion He immediately sent  for British officers who ordered military execution and you may easily believe how  soon regular troops got the better of unarmed despair They were conquered vanquished and slaughtered and Mr Goodlad ordered that of these miserable people two or three should undergo the process of the law and be publicly hanged up and hanged up they were  But my Lords though the rebellion seemed to be crushed the country was in that situation that Mr Goodlad was  obliged to write down to Calcutta that there never had been so material and serious a rebellion in Bengal This was in and it made a very great noise in Calcutta But there is such a gulph between us and Calcutta that I venture to say not one of all the great and noble auditors present ever heard of it On the contrary it is a constant rule that whenever any thing is quiet in Bengal you are sure to hear of it Here the inside of Bengal Government was exposed to view When they heard this they thought it behoved them not to pass by such conduct and which a poor easy man could not tell how to account for They therefore cast about for a goodnatured easy man who should make that sort of report which might lay faults on both sides and as a retrospect could only tend to renew greivances that the criminal should be left in possession of his acquisitions and the people of their possessions They wished it might appear that the material cause of the insurrection might be the determination of the Zemindars to pay no more rent The Committee however thought it necessary to send a Commissioner to examine into the  cause of the insurrection and they cast about to find a man that was fit to be a good representer of affairs that so the channel of all this ferocity and wickedness should be concealed Accordingly they found out a man of a tolerable free character supposed to be a man of moderation almost to excess mild quiet totally unconnected with party and of peaceable character  If it were of consequence to expose Mr Burke's blunders upon all occasions the writer of this note would observe that the real character of Mr Paterson except that he is a man of honour and integrity is directly the  reverse  of Mr Burke's description He is a gentleman of uncommonly  lively parts  a very neat poet an excellent companion and with great good nature in private life possesses an admirable turn for satire as every man of letters in Bengal well knew Mr Paterson was appointed the Commissioner on the recommendation of Sir John Shore the latter being the acting Chief of the Committee and Mr Paterson  one of his assistants    They thought that just such a man as that was exactly the man for their purpose and they took it for granted that from him they might expect an account in which faults should be left out on both sides and buried in oblivion and it should be remembered that a retrospect could only tend to renew grievances They chose  well but there never was a man so mistaken in the world Mr Paterson undert his quiet honest character concealed a vigorous mind deciding understanding and a feeling heart He is the son of a gentleman of venerable age and extraordinary character in this country who long filled the seat of Chairman of the Committee of Supply in the House of Commons but is now retired to an honourable rest in the neighbourhood this son as soon as he was appointed to the commission dreaded the consequences but to justify himself he took out a letter that he had received from his father which was the preservation of his character and the destruction of his fortune and this letter enjoined him to pursue such a perfect line of conduct and to hazard every prosecution rather than to disgrace truth that he went up into the country in a proper frame of mind to do his duty I beg to read from his letter how that gentleman found that country on his arrival and how he accounts for the rebellion  "In my two reports I have set forth the general manner that oppession has provoked the husbandmen to part with  their stock and goods I mean not to enumerate them now every day my enquiries serve to confirm the facts the wonder would have been if they had not revolted seeing it was not a collection of the revenue but a robbery with criminal punishment and every instrument of disgrace and this extended to every individualThere is a period at which oppression will be resisted Conceive the situation of the husbandman Every thing they had in the world was dragged away exposed to every exaggerated demand and sold at so low a price as not to answer that demand subjected to criminal punishment with the loss of his women and cast"  You will allow the full effect of prejudice on this subject the consequence of a loss of the cast to these persons I have stated to your Lordships before the loss of the cast there amounts to more than a complete excommunication outlawry or attainder in this country the man or woman that has lost their cast are no longer the children of their parents  and they can survive only in the estimation of the lowest and basest of mankind But there was an instrument of torture to them still worse there is a kind of pillory a disgrace in that country particularly to the Bramins which is to be put on a bullock with drums beating and led through the town this was so done  This punishment was inflicted and very properly upon a man called Basdeo Doss who had of his own authority  inflicted such of the cruelties upon some of the inhabitants of Dhee Jumla as they really suffered  When Sir John Shore gave his opinion in November upon this cause he remarked that Basdeo Doss deserved the most exemplary punishment for his conduct  and the people supplicated that the man should not be so cruelly treated I have now stated the causes of the rebellion and the opinion of the man when he saw that country which was not a matter of inquisition it was a matter of public notoriety There is an expression of one of the men that went into it that he passed twelve miles without seeing a light and without finding means of fire to dress his necessary  food All these hurtful calamities were the consequence of the government of Deby Sing one would imagine that this drew upon him the severity of the Governor that if ever there were any arbitrary power it would be here exercised we must not be too hasty in forming an opinion The report of the Commissioner might be subjected to great mistakes  This alludes to a minute of Sir John Shore which he presented in the Committee of Revenue in which he expresses his doubts of the truth of the facts and observes that if they were of such a nature as Mr Paterson had stated proofs might be procured without any difficulty  Gunga Govind Sing when it came before him well played his part On the first report the committee were a little stunned they did not know what to do with it but at last after that came down a full report with evidence in the full body of it  This is not the caseMr Paterson merely transmitted the complaints as he received them and was not responsible either for their truth or falsehood  as the Commissioner was a man of business and of serious thinking he made such a report filled with such a body  of evidence as probably the records of that country cannot furnish Reports of all persons who act in the government by its authority in public functions exercising public trust are entitled to presumptive credit  This is undoubtedly true but it was not from any doubt of Mr Paterson's veracity that Sir John Shore  required some proofs  of the assertions made by the Natives who delivered the complaints to Mr Paterson  for the truth of all they assert and throw the responsibility and the burden of the proof on those that shake it unless corruption malice or some evil disposition is found in the person who makes this report it ought to pass in the opinion of those who ordered it as proof but very different ideas prevail in this committee of Mr Hastings The first act of this executive body neither having the right or the name of a judicial character was to turn Mr Paterson into a voluntary accuser having made a charge they call upon him to prove it they put Deby Sing against Mr Paterson they take an objection that the depositions are not all upon oath they were never ordered to be upon oath not one  word is upon oath they throw a doubt a shadow upon them all In short Deby Sing appears as your Lordships imagine he will appear a very difficulty a very slur in the way of their commission and they suppose that Mr Paterson has been carried away by the warmth of his imagination that he has assumed what is not to be proved they allow that presumptive proofs are pretty strong against Deby Sing and Mr Hastings is of opinion that there is nothing here charged against him of which he is not guilty  Here again is one of those  misrepresentations  of which we hope Mr Burke  only  is capable Mr Hastings never pronounced any opinion on the case of Deby Sing because the enquiry was not completed during his Government but he was so much prejudiced against him that he ordered him  to be removed from all  his appointments  pending the  enquiry and he declared just before he left Bengal that such was his opinion of Deby Sing that he thought he  might  be guilty of the enormities alleged against him and that he  might  be able to conceal them from Mr Goodlad This strongly confirms what Sir John Shore said  "that every member of the Government had formed a decided opinion  against  Deby Sing and that  if proved guilty he had no mercy to expect  "  My Lords  I am sorry to break your attention it is a subject that pains me very much it is long difficult and arduous but with the blessing of God if I can I will go through it today The next step they took was their putting him into the shape of an accuser to make good a charge which he made out much to their satisfaction  The next step they took was a charge  At this period Mr Burke suddenly laid his hand upon his breast and dropped down His brother his son and other gentlemen came to his assistance The Court broke up in the utmost confusion Some ladies  fainted  while others had sense and firmness to treat this  oratorical trick  as it deserved An engraver has given us a view of the High Court in Westminster Hall during the heighth of this curious scene    February th  IN CONTINUATION  MY LORDS  I AM convinced that my continuation of this cause has been attended with some difficulties  to your Lordships on account of my inability to proceed yesterday but your Lordships' love of justice has removed every obstruction and I therefore proceed with confidence to the business now before your Lordships I think to the best of my remembrance the House adjourned at the period of time in which I was endeavouring to illustrate the mischiefs that happened from Mr Hastings throwing off his responsibility by delegating that power to a council and in fact to Black Men and the consequence of it in preventing the detection and the punishment of the grossest abuses that ever were known to be committed in India or in any other part of the world I stated to you that Mr Commissioner Paterson was sent into that country that he was sent with all the authority of Government with powers not only to hear to report but to redress the grievances which he should find in short there was nothing wanted to his power but an honest Court to report to He reported those things which I delivered to you and did very imperfectly very faintly and shortly according to my materials state to you  that instead of being furnished with that share of power which Mr Hastings has endeavoured to use on other occasions against those who had incurred his private resentment this man was put in all business of offence and defence which the most litigious and prevaricating laws that ever were invented to screen peculation and power from the cries of an oppressed people could effect Mr Paterson who as I stated was deputed with all the authority of Government to a great province was now considered as a voluntary accuser and to make good the articles of his charge against Deby Sing but I believe Deby Sing did not long remain in the humble sinking suppliant situation of a man under charges or in a secondary and subordinate situation as answering those charges By degrees as the protection increased his boldness grew along with it he no longer took the tone of an accused person he reverses the situation imposed on Mr Patterson he beeomes Mr Paterson's accuser he began at first to say he believed he was mistaken took up things a little too warmly he now steps forward charges him with forgery  and desires to be heard in this nominal Committee This business has now taken a third shape first Mr Paterson is a Commissioner to report then he is to make good his charge then he is accused and ordered to answer the charges this is the third metamorphosis of Mr Paterson's situation In this situation which is what I will venture to say never happened before in the annals of mankind he was ordered to bring Deby Sing to prison that infamous character that abandoned mortal loaded with crimes by the Committee themselves Deby Sing was committed under guard but he was soon taken from under that guard and he sat assessor by the side of Mr Paterson In such a situation all human constancy would be shaken and its manhood gone To report the grievances of those that had been rich but were now undone by oppressors was invidious the road of fortune was easy to Mr Paterson I believe you are convinced that the Committee would not have received a different report as a proof of bribery they would rather have received it as tending to soften and conciliate this difficult matter and to settle the order of  Government as soon as possible but this man who withstood all temptations whose honour fidelity principle and good character received the thanks and withstood the thanks of those that accused him this man was turned into the accused person in this Committee In this situation I must do him the justice to say he never tottered one moment he stood like a hero  The whole of this part of the account is so extremely wild that no man without explanation can understand it Sir John Shore complained that Mr Paterson's accounts were inaccurate or vague and he censured him for disrespect to the Committee Mr Paterson replied and after much altercation the Committee sent to the Supreme Council all their correspondence with Mr Paterson and  every document and every information  which they had received from him relative to the insurrection and to the conduct of Deby Sing The Supreme Council  Mr Hastings being at Lucknow  viz Mr Wheler Sir John Macpherson and Mr Stables met four days successively morning and evening and having read Mr Paterson's reports and the documents they unanimously resolved  that three sworn Commissioners  should be appointed to go through this cause and that Deby Sing should be  confined  and his property  attached  until judgment was pronounced by the Governor General and Council The whole of this proceeding is strictly  just fair  and  honourable  but were it otherwise Mr Hastings was  absent  and  ignorant of every part of it  Sir John Shore observes in that every member of the Bengal Government in had formed a  decided opinion against Deby Sing  and that if found guilty  he had no mercy to expect    he was sent  as a protector when the people looked upon him as carrying with him the whole power of Government He was forced to go back to try whether among a miserable ruined undone abject people he was to find any who had courage enough to stand to their former accusations such treatment no servant of Government ever received The next step was to appoint another set of Commissioners to try the question between him and Deby Sing  Here Mr Burke closes his account of the complaints which were made from Rungpore We will therefore in a very few words give a fair state of the transactions relative to that province  In the year Sir John Shore and the Committee of Revenue conceived that the Government ought to receive about seventy thousand rupees a year from that province beyond the rent of the preceding year and at that advanced rent Deby Sing agreed to take it entering into obligations not to impose any additional taxes upon the Ryots This engagement was for two years The first year's rent was paid without a balance or a complaint When six months of the second year were expired an insurrection broke out in the province and Mr Paterson was sent by Sir John Shore and the Committee to enquire and report the cause of it He transmitted to the Committee several papers in which certain Zemindars and Ryots stated the several facts which Mr Burke has mentioned To determine upon the truth of these complaints the Supreme Council appointed three sworn Commissioners and after the fullest and the most minute investigations by far the greater number were found to have no sort of foundation In some instances Deby Sing following the example  of the Zemindars  had collected the revenues with a rigour and severity very unusual under the British Government in India and he was compelled to make complete satisfaction for every act of injustice he had committed but when the points in which he  was culpable  are compared with the  accusations  stated by Mr Burke the man must appear to be perfectly innocent The unjustifiable deception of Mr Burke was in stating all the facts as if they had been  proved  and established by evidence  Who were those gentlemen  men appointed on the commission A set of juniors  The three gentlemen appointed were  three years senior to Mr Paterson in the  service and as Sir John Shore well observed  reluctantly  undertook the office imposed upon them and which it was not in their power to refuse  They were to enquire into the proceedings  and he was to appear like an accused person but without authority to make out such a state of defence as he could In that situation he represented and sent I believe one of the most pathetic memorials that ever was sent to a Council He was a man of honour and principle and well deserved for his conduct the honour of suffering all the persecutions in the cause of virtue  Mr Paterson applied to the Supreme Council for permission to go to Rungpore This permission the Council viz Messrs Wheler Macpherson and Stables granted Mr Hastings being absent and as utterly unconnected with the business as Mr Burke himself  He went back into that country without his commission The junior servants that were sent to enquire into the iniquity into the utter ruin of the country spent a long time in matters of form but they found they could not do without a representative and Deby Sing was sent down to them This man was under an accusation he was considered as a prisoner and according to the mild ways of that country and especially where they chose to be mild he was not imprisoned in the common goal  at Calcutta not in the prison of the Fort not in the goal where Nundcomar was put when he appeared in Calcutta he was put under sepoys he was permitted to go abroad and Mr Hastings with an address which seldom failed him and never wanting to a man possessing Â£ managed to convert this guard into a retinue of honourThey attended him with their sidearms only and marked him out as a great magistrate instead of attending upon him as a guard When he was ordered to send a vaqueel he refused upon which the Commissioners finding they could do without him instead of saying if you will not send you are not to come yourself allowed him to come It was not necessary for him to be there but he comes himself and enters this place rather as a person arriving from victory than as a man under the load of these charges The complainants saw him a person high in authority in the country All these marks of respect should have been turned into marks of infamy to this infernal villain whose conduct I have had the honour or rather I should say I have been obliged to mention to your Lordships  Mr Paterson seeing the minds of the people broken subdued and prostrate under it and that so far from the means of representing his duty between the criminal and magistrate he had not that of defending his own innocence represented to these Commissioners the junior servants of the Company that this appearance and this immense retinue tending to strike terror into the minds of the natives had prevented him from executing justice The Council  That is Mr Wheler Sir John Macpherson and Mr Stables in the absence of Mr Hastings  sat upon it and they found it was true that it would have an evil tendency On the other hand they say for they are very tender he should appear under a guard therefore they take a middle way and they ordered them to UNSKREW their bayonets and to consider them as troops The next step they took was to release Mr Paterson from all concern in these transactions One would have thought that it was only right for Deby Sing to be excluded No there he sat as a sovereign four years They enjoyed the office and  Deby Sing remained in honour though in something like confinement  This concluding part of Mr Burke's speech is unfortunately but too true the special Commission of Enquiry was appointed in March Mr Hastings who was then absent and did not return to Calcutta until November and left India the first of February following expressed his surprise that the report had not been made and moved that the Commissioners should be peremptorily ordered to make their report in two months The enquiry was so  minute  that it was not until February that they entirely closed all their proceedings and it was not until the th of November that judgment was pronounced which Lord Cornwallis justly laments as a great evil    Now my Lords to bring all this business home to Mr Hastings I stated to you before that I considered Mr Hastings as responsible for the acts of the people he employed doubly responsible if he knew them to be bad I charge him with putting men of evil characters in situations in which any evil might be committed I charge him as Chief Governor with destroying the institutions of the country which were and ought to have been the check upon this people  I charge him with putting a person called a Steward or  Dewan  of the province as a controul on the Farmers General of it so that no controul should exist and that he should be let loose to rapine and destruction for the two offices were both vested in him It may be askedDid Mr Hastings order these cruelties I answer No But if be had kept firm to the duty that the Act of Parliament had appointed all the revenue regulations must have been made by him But instead of that he appointed Gunga Govind Sing and placed him in the seat of government Mr Hastings is responsible for destroying his own legal capacity next for destroying the legal capacity of the council not one of whom could have any knowledge of the country  There is something so very foreign from the actual fact in this statement that we shall offer a few remarks upon it It has happened that Sir John Shore arrived in England in time to depose in WestminsterHall that the appointment of the Committee of Revenues did  not  tend to deprive the Supreme Council of all knowledge of a revenue and that it did not tend to throw power into the hands of Mr Hastings The public official accounts prove that considerable advantages resulted to the public by an actual increase of the revenues at a time as Mr Hastings observed to the Directors in May  "when the preservation of the Company's interest  in every part of India  depended upon realizing the resources of Bengal"  Without troubling our readers with confused and perplexed accounts of remissions settlements or balances we shall content ourselves by taking from the records in WestminsterHall the actual amount of the net money paid into the Company's treasury from the landed revenues the three years  preceding  and the three years  subsequent  to that plan of Mr Hastings' which is supposed contrary to truth and the universal knowledge of mankind to have involved Bengal in such a scene of distress as no other country ever experienced  Preceding the new System  Subsequent to it  Â   Sicca Rupees  Â   Â                           Â     Â     So that this country so ruined and undone by the change produced a net addition of Sicca rupees or Â£ sterling and the improved and improving state of Bengal from that time to this must convince any rational being that there is no foundation for the many simple stories we have heard of the distressed state of Bengal for if Mr Hastings had violently kept up the revenue for three years by improper or oppressive exactions those revenues must have fallen off in succeeding years whereas in fact the country has continued progressively improving to the present time  When he had done that and had  destroyed all power in the country he had every thing in his own hands and for all things he is answerable They could not  possibly have concealed from the public eye such acts as these the Provincial Councils had removed but Mr Hastings destroyed every charge Having destroyed every controul above and below and delivered the whole country into the hands of Gunga Govind Sing for all his acts he is responsible I have read to you and I hope and trust it is fresh in your remembrance that Deby Sing was presented to Mr Hastings by Gunga Govind Sing namely by that set of servants as they call themselves who act as they themselves tell us and most naturally as the tools of Govind Sing and he is further responsible because he took the bribe of Dinagepore the country that was ravaged in this manner  We have already stated that  Rungpore  and not  Dinagepore  was the province in which the insurrection broke out  We shall prove he took  bribes of some body or other in power of Â£ through the medium of that person whom he had appointed to exercise all the affairs of the Supreme Council above and of all the subordinate Council belowSo that you see he had appointed a Council of Tools at the expence of Â£ to do all the offices for the purpose of establishing a bribefactor general a general receiver and agent of bribes through all the country and he is answerable for the whole  Mr Burke in his most singular composition assumes it  as a fact  that Mr Hastings had delivered over the whole kingdom of Bengal to Gunga Govind Sing in whose hands the Committee of Revenue were  tools  and therefore for all  his acts Mr Hastings is responsible    But in this letter to the Court of Directors remonstrating against the appointment of Sir John Shore to the government of Bengal he affirms that he finds Mr Shore to have been materially concerned  as a principal actor and party  in the maladministration of the Revenue Board and that against him much criminal matter is at this moment at issue before the highest Tribunal in the nation  Without attempting to reconcile to common sense such absurdities and contradictions it will be sufficient to observe that  no one act  of oppression alleged to have been committed by Mr Hastings or by Sir John Shore or by Gunga Govind Sing has been  proved  and let the calculation be made in any possible way it will be found that in the three years following the establishment of the Committee of Revenue the revenues actually  netted  considerably  more  than the revenues  netted  in the three last years of the Provincial Council  That Mr Burke most grossly abused the power  delegated  to him by the last Parliament is  unquestionably true  He confessed it when he said that he  ought not  to be expected like Shylock  to cut just the pound of flesh and no more  To shew the mans utter  inconsistency upon all subjects  we insert the following passage from his "Appeal"  "What can sound with such horrid discordance in the  moral ear  as this position that a Delegate  with limited powers  may break his engagement to his constituents  assume an authority never committed to him to alter things at his pleasure  and then if he can persuade  a large number of men to flatter him in the power he has usurped  that he is absolved in his own conscience and ought to stand acquitted in the eyes of mankind On this scheme the maker of the experiment must begin with  a determined perjury That point is certain  He must take his chance for the expiatory addresses This is to make  the success of villainy  the standard  of innocence  "  It is true Mr Burke was not a  sworn delegate  but no man of honour needs  an oath  to keep him to the strict line of his duty He has well defined the functions  of a delegate  let us examine how he exercised those functions himself  He was appointed  one of the delegates  of the last House of Commons His duty was  defined  namely to make good  certain articles  which  that House  had voted Though the fact be true that the House had never read by far the greater number of those articles yet Mr Burke had an undoubted right to expatiate as he pleased on every allegation in those articles however irregularly or unjustly they were voted But in manifest contradiction  to his own sense of the moral obligations imposed upon a delegate  he introduced the episode of Deby Sing a subject on which  his constituents  had never heard a word and of course they could give  him  no instructions upon it Nor was this all he told his story most unfairly  He imposed upon his auditors by stating the facts as if the  truth  of them was beyond all question and that consequently the only matter for consideration hereafter would be whether Mr Hastings and Sir John Shore could be made  responsible  for the facts Yet Mr Burke  knew  that the  truth  or  falsehood  of the facts was a subject of a very long and solemn enquiry the result of which was as it has  since  appeared that the facts charged were false in their most material parts Where the charges were not without foundation it was proved that they had been very greatly exaggerated    THE END
