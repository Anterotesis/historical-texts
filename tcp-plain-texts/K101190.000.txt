 TRACTS CONCERNING THE ANCIENT AND ONLY TRUE LEGAL MEANS OF NATIONAL DEFENCE BY A FREE MILITIA  I The ancient CommonLaw Right of  associating with the Vicinage  in every County District or Town to

Town to support the Civil Magistrate in maintaining the Peace  MAN being by  nature  a social creature it is  natural  for him to  associate  with his brethren and neigh∣bours for common defence against all  unjust violence  and such  association  being  just  and  reasonable  as well as  natural  we have not only a  right  thus to associate but are even  bound  to do it by a branch of the

For which he cites Bracton l i c  This c seems to be an error of the press instead of c num the proper reference to Bracton's dec∣laration concerning the NATURAL RIGHT of all men  to  RESIST VIOLENCE AND INJURY  Hoc autem jus gentium soium hominibus commune est veluti erga Deum religio ut parentibus et patriae pareamus ut  VIM  atque  INJURIAM PROPULSEMUS  nam  DE JURE  hoc evenit ut quod quis ob

citizen to be exercised and expert in  "Arms of Defence and Peace"  for mutual protection but these alas are too generally discouraged and ne∣glected whilst  arms of offence and robbery  are eagerly pre∣paring in every port The unprincipled and abandon∣ed part of mankind that lay aside all  discernment be∣tween right and wrong  are prompted by royal Procla∣mations not merely to  "covet their neighbours goods"  but to  lay wait for and take  them whereby war is more notoriously declared and is infinitely more active  against trade and the honourable merchants of the world  than a∣gainst the standing armies and navies of our enemies Thus the seas swarm with piratical banditti carrying letters of  dispensation for dishonesty  and  the earth is filled with violence  Have we not cause to expect some tre∣mendous vengeance to vindicate the  righteousness of  GOD or that the Almighty will once more command the ele∣ments to sweep  corrupted man  from the face of the earth We are secured indeed by divine promise from any future general destruction by a deluge of  water  but the elements of  tempest  and  fire  are still reserved to exe∣cute the wrath of GOD and are frequently mentioned as the instruments of his vengeance Isaiah xvii Psa lxxxiii cxlviii Dan ii Thess i Pet iii  num So the Author of Doctor and Student in his second chapter concern∣ing the law of Nature and Nations and the law of Reason asserts that  by the law of reason it is lawful to repell force with force and that it is  THE RIGHT OF EVERY ONE  fas est unicuique se tueri  c    TO DEFEND HIMSELF  AND HIS PROPERTY AGAINST UNJUST VIOLENCE  Lex rationis permittat plurima fieri ut scilicet quod licitum est vim vi repellere et quod  fas est unicui∣que  se tueri et rem suam defendere contra vim injustam

the body due circumstances being observed    Quod licitum est vim vi repellere pro tuitione corporis debitis circumstantiis servatis  C p  b  Now as the Laws of  reason  and  nature are immutable  Et

 of every individual to  repel force with force  in defence of himself and property can never be an∣nulled by  any act of parliament  but must ever be esteemed as  immutable rights of the common law  and must always remain in force unless the government should unhappily  cease to be  LEGAL by setting aside the first foundations of the LAW Ancient statutes however though not the foundation of  these rights  yet bear ample testimony to the exercise or usage of them for what is  the power of the countie  so often mentioned in the an∣cient law and statutes but  an armed as∣sociation of the

time of king James I the word is explained by the Greek plural  which signifies  arms  or instruments of war of all sorts in general and this is the sense also of the word  Armure  as used in the

loose    s    d  for every shot" Also  if the inhabitants of any towne have not made and continued  their Buts as  they ought to do    lose  s  for every moneths  Eirenarcha book p  for which he cites Hen VIII c in which indeed the obli∣gation for  every man  to have arms and  be exercised  therein is expressed still in stronger terms  viz    that butts be made on this side the feast of St Mi∣chael the Archangel next coming in e∣very city town and place by the inha∣bitants of every such city town and place  ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF ANCIENT TIMES USED  and that the said inhabitants and dwellers in every of them be  COMPELLED TO MAKE AND CONTINUE SUCH BUTTS  upon pain to forfeit for every    months so lacking    s And that  THE SAID IN∣HABITANTS SHALL EXERCISE THEM∣SELVES WITH LONGBOWS IN SHOOTING AT THE SAME and else∣where in holy days  and other times convenient  And to the intent that EVERY PERSON  may have bows of mean  price  be it enacted  c  § iv and v Thus the law not only  permits  but ab∣solutely  requires  EVERY PERSON to  have arms  and be EXERCISED in the use of them  The exercise of the Longbow was formerly esteemed the most effectual mi∣litary discipline for the defence of the kingdom and is so declared in another act of parliament of the same year cap    Divers gentlemen yeomen and servingmen  now of late have laid apart the  good and laudable exer∣cise  of the  Longbow  which always heretofore hath been  the surety safeguard and continual defence of this realm of England and an inestimable aread and terror to the enemies of the same  Extract from the preamble to the act of Hen VIII c  Hence it is plain that  gentlemen yeomen and serving men  were required by law to be  exercised in the use of such arms  as were esteemed the best for the safe∣guard and defence of the realm  and therefore as the law at that time  required  EVERY MAN  to be exer∣cised  in the use of the  then  fashionable weapons the reason of the law holds e∣qually  good to  require the exercise of  ALL MEN in the use of the present fashionable weapons the  musquet and bayonet  But even at that time the use of mus∣quets or guns was allowed to the inha∣bitants of all cities boroughs and mar∣kettowns and for the very fame reason the defence of the realm by a provisio∣nal clause of the lastmentioned act § vi  Provided alway and be it enact∣ed  c  that it shall be lawful from henceforth to all gentlemen yeomen and servingmen of every lord spiri∣tual and temporal and of all knights esquires and gentlemen and to ALL THE INHABITANTS  of cities bo∣roughs  and

esquires and gentlemen and the INHABITANTS  of  EVERY CI∣TY BOROUGH AND MARKETTOWN  to have and keep in every of their houses any such handgun or handguns  of the length of one whole yard  c  and NOT

keep not in readinesse such horses geldings weapon armour or other furniture for the wars as after the proportion of his abilitie he ought to have and keepe  Eirenarcha book iv c p Thus stood the law so late as the latter end of queen Elizabeth's reign when the book lastcited was published and the general tenor of the doctrine respecting the  right of Englishmen to have arms  hath since been confirmed by  the Declaration of Rights in the Act of Settlement  Wm Mary st c though it seems now to be limited to  Protestant subjects viz  That the subjects which are Protes∣tants  MAY HAVE ARMS FOR THEIR DEFENCE  suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law  This latter expression  "as allowed by law"  respects the limitations in the abovementioned act  of Hen VIII c which restrain the use of  some particular sorts of arms  meaning only such arms as were liable to be concealed or otherwise favour the designs of murderers as  crossbows little short handguns and little hag∣buts  and all guns UNDER CERTAIN LENGTHS specified in the act but  proper arms for defence  provided they are  not shorter  than the act directs are so far from being forbidden by this statute that they are clearly authorised and  "the exercise thereof"  expressly re∣commended by it as I have already shewn And indeed the laws of England always required the people to be armed and not only to be  armed  but to be  ex∣pert in arms  which last was particular∣ly recommended by the learned chancel∣lor Fortescue  et revera non mini∣me erit regno accommodum ut  incolae ejus in armis sint experti    Indeed it will be of no small advantage to the  kingdom that the inhabitants be  EX∣PERT IN ARMS  De Laudibus Legum Angliae c xliv p And in the notes and remarks on this book by the learned Mr Justice Aland we find the following observations to the same purpose 'In the Confessor's laws' says he 'it is'  DEBENT  "All freeman  OUGHT"  debent  it is their duty  TO HAVE ARMS and to keep them always ready for  the defence of the kingdom  c  UNIVERSI LIBERI HOMINES  c  ARMA HABE∣RE ET ILLA SEMPER PROMPTA CONSERVARE AD TUITIONEM REG∣NI  c  "See" says he  the laws of the Conqueror  TO THE SAME PUR∣POSE  The custom of the nation  con∣tinues this learned judge  has been  TO TRAIN UP THE FREEHOLDERS TO DISCIPLINE v and C ii c iii and ib § and title WAR  in the table to the statutes  Among the ancient constitutions or ordinances of the kingdom recorded in the Myrror of Justices chap i § we read that it was ordained  that every one of the age of years and above  should prepare him  se apprestat  to kill mortal offenders in their notorious crimes or to follow them from town to town with hue and cry  c  The true purpose and advantage of ha∣ving  all the inhabitants  of this kingdom trained to arms is farther manifested in our old law books and statutes as in the Westminster Primer cap xvii on the case when any cattle are unlawfully taken and driven into any castle or strong hold  c    Le Visc  •  ou le Bailife prise ove luy  POYAR DE SON COUNTIE  ou de sa Bail et voile assaier de faire de ceo repl' des avers a celuy qui les aver prise  c  That the sheriff or the bailiff shall take with him THE POWER OF HIS COUNTY or of his bailiwick and  shall endeavour to make replevin  or recovery  of the cattle  from him that hath taken them  c  And lord Coke remarks on this  Nota  EVERY MAN  is bound by the CommonLaw to assist not only the Sherife in his Office for the Execution of the King's Writs which are the Commandments of the King  ACCORDING TO LAW  "Commandment of the King according to Law"  Any commandment of the king which falls not within this description is  not binding  or  valid in law  for the king's commands ought only to proceed  by due process of the law  through the king's courts of justice which are  the only  proper channels in which  the executive power  of this limited monarchy can legally flow and be exerted because it is one of the first principles of our constitution  that the king can do nothing on earth as he is the minister and vicar of  God  but that only which he may do by the law    Nihil aliud potest rex in terris cum sit Dei minister et vicarius nisi id solum quod de jure potest  Bract lib iii c And this teaches us how to understand the trite maxim that  "the king can do no wrong" i e  he has no legal  authority to do wrong    Potestas sua juris est et non injuriae  Bract lib iii c  He has not any peculiar prerogative  either to  do wrong  or to decline from  doing right  and  justice  NON EST ULLA REGIS PRERO∣GATIVA  quae ex justitia et equitate quicquam derogat  Rot Parl Hen IV num But if any king of this  limited monarchy  should nevertheless wilfully  do wrong  and presume to rule contrary to the laws and fundamental principles of the ancient constitution he ceases to be  "the minister and vicar of God"  and in the eye of the law immediately commences  Minister Diaboli    Potestas enim juris solius est Dei injuriae vero  DIABOLI  et  CUJUS  opera fecerit  EJUS ET MI∣NISTER ERIT  Fleta lib i cap p See also in Bracton lib iii cap p who after reciting the same doctrine concerning the effect of  good  or  bad  measures adds  "Igitur dum facit"  rex  JUSTITIAM  vicarius est  REGIS AETERNI  minister autem  DIABOLI  dum declinet ad injuriam  and the consequence must be fatal even to the  temporal  state of such an one because all legal authority of the sovereign ceases in this realm if the king presumes to rule by  "will and pleasure"  instead of law  for there is  NO KING  where  WILL  governs and  NOT LAW  Non est enim rex ubi dominatur voluntas et non lex  Bract lib i c The advisers therefore of illegal measures or any measures that require an  undue influence  in parli∣ament to make them pass are so far from deserving the title of the  "king's friends"  that they are really his most dangerous enemies they are  traitors  whose  disloyal  councils lead to certain destruction as nothing but  "righteousness can establish the throne"  but also his  Baily that hath the Sheriffe's Warrant in that Behalfe hath the same Authori∣ty  c  Inst p  The attack of a castle or place of arms must require disciplined troops and therefore it was certainly necessary that "EVERY MAN"  so bound by the commonlaw to assist should be trained to arms  in order to fulfil his duty And the learned Nathaniel Bacon in his historical Dis∣course of the Uniformity of the Govern∣ment of England st part p re∣marks that  the Strength consisted of the Freemen and though many were bound by Tenure to follow their Lords to the Wars and many were Voluntiers yet it seems  ALL WERE BOUND UPON CALL UNDER PERIL OF FINE AND WERE BOUND TO KEEP ARMS  for the Preservation of the Kingdom their Lords and their own Persons and these they might neither pawn nor sell  but leave them to descend to their Heirs  c  The commonlaw right of the people of England  to have arms  is also clearly ex∣pressed  by the great and learned judge Bracton one of the most ancient writers of our commonlaw who is justly es∣teemed of unexceptionable authority  ei qui justè possidet licitum erit cum ar∣mis contra pacem venientem ut expellat cum armis repellere ut per  ARMA TU∣ITIONIS ET PACIS quae sunt justitiae  repellat injuriam et vim injustam et ar∣ma injuriae  c  Bract lib iv c  i e    to him who justly possesses it SHALL BE LAWFUL  with arms  to re∣pel him who cometh to expel with arms against the peace that by ARMS OF DEFENCE AND PEACE  which are of justice he may repel injury and unjust violence and arms of injus∣tice  c  The late unhappy tumults prove that these principles of the English constitu∣tion are as  necessary  to be enforced  at pre∣sent as ever they were  for had they not been fatally neglected and disused the  abandoned rioters would have been quel∣led and secured by the neighbouring in∣habitants of Westminster  c  in  their first attempts  or in case they had advan∣ced towards the city if  the proper barriers had been reserved  the citizens would have had time to get under arms to support their own magistrates in securing the peace of the city for any attack upon the gates or posterns would have justified an im∣mediate discharge of firearms or other weapons against the assailants without waiting for the command of a peaceofficer and as the inhabitants of each city and county are required to make good the damages sustained on such oc∣casions by private individuals it is plain that the  inhabitants themselves  in their collective capacity do form that proper POWER from which the law requires the  prevention  of such damages and the support and defence of the civil magis∣trates for otherwise the law ought to  have directed the damages to be deduct∣ed from the last preceding parliamentary grants to the  army  If it be alledged that there can be no occasion in these modern times to arm and train the inhabitants of England because there is an ample military force or  standing army  to preserve the peace yet let it be remembered that the great∣er and more powerful  the standing army is  so much more necessary is it that there  should be a proper balance to that power  to prevent any ill effects from it though there is one bad effect which  the balance  howsoever perfect and excellent cannot prevent and that is  the enormous and ru∣inous expence  of maintaining  a large num∣ber of men without any civil employment for their support  an expence which nei∣ther the  land  nor  trade  of this realm can possibly bear much longer without pub∣lic failure  No Englishman therefore can be truly LOYAL who opposes these essential principles of the English LAW  One of the articles against cardinal Wolsey Hen VIII was for that he did endeavour to subvert antiquissimas leges hujus regni universumque hoc regnum  Angliae  legibus  imperialibus  subjugare  'Tis fit that those who attempt to subvert the laws should according to the old writ be carried  ad goalam de Newgate  Merito beneficium legis amittit qui  legem ipsam  subvertere intendit  Mr Justice Aland's Notes on Fortescue de Laudibus Legum Ang p  whereby the people are required to have  arms of defence and peace  for mutual as well as private defence for  a stand∣ing army of regular soldiers is entirely re∣pugnant to the constitution of England and the genius of its inhabitants  No English king before Charles II had any other guards than his pensioners and yeomen of the guard first appointed by that great oppressor of his people Henry VII save Richard II who with the aid of profligate archers made himself absolute The usurper  Cromwell  it is notorious kept up an army in support of himself and his tyranny  and Charles II being connived at in keeping a few ad∣ditional guards he insensibly increased their num∣ber till he left a body of men to his successor great enough to tell the parliament he would be no longer bound by the laws he had sworn to  In the year immediately after the conclusion of the war with France it is well known how far the soldiery against king William's inclination and earnest endea∣vours were reduced On behalf of the court it was then declared that  the army was not designed to be made a part of our constitution but to be kept only for a little time till the circumstances of Europe would better permit us to be without them  To which it was answered and reasons given to prove that  these conspirators against their country were sa∣tisfied that their continuance then was an establish∣ment of them for ever  'And it was farther obser'ved that  the very discontents they might create would be made an argument for the continuing of them but if they should be kept from oppressing the people in a little time they would grow habitual to us and almost  become a part of our constitution  and by degrees we should be brought to believe them not only  not dangerous  but  necessary  for every body saw but few understood and those few would never be a∣ble to persuade the multitude that there was any dan∣ger in those men they had lived quietly with for some years  'And moreover that  without dear bought experience any body may know before hand what will be the natural consequences of  a standing army  From the day you set them up you set up your mas∣ters you put yourselves wholly into their hands and are at their discretion It is  the conquest  of the nation in the silentest shortest and surest way They are able to dispose of your lives and estates at  will and pleasure  and what can a foreign conque∣ror do more If after this we live and possess any thing it is because they let us and how long that shall be neither  we  nor  they themselves know    Conti∣nued Corruption standing Armies c considered  p  Standing armies were not unknown indeed to our ancestors in very early  times but they were happily opposed by them and declared  illegal  A remarka∣ble instance of this is related by Sir Ed∣ward Coke in his th rep p Cal∣vin's case but with a very  erroneous  ap∣plication of the doctrine as there are in many other instances of that particular report for which the chancellor or judges probably who spoke and not the reporter must one day be answerable  It appeareth by Bracton lib iii tract c fol that Canutus the Danish king having settled himself in this kingdom in peace  kept  notwith∣standing  for the better continuance thereof great armies within this realm  Yet Bracton was more wise and honourable than to conceive or hint  that  great armies  so kept by the king were proper instruments  for the better continuance of peace  for he says no such thing this being only a  disloyal  conceit of some modern judge concern∣ed in the argument of Calvin's case but to return to the words of the reporter  The peers and nobles of England distas∣ting  THIS GOVERNMENT BY ARMES AND ARMIES  And every Englishman that has not the same  dis∣taste  is surely  disaffected  to the true constitution and laws of his country and may justly be charged with  disloyalty  for none but  freemen  ought to be trusted with arms in a  free country  and not men that are enslaved un∣der martial law in regular

persuaded the king that they would provide for the safety of him and his people and yet his armies carrying with them many incon∣veniences should be withdrawn  c  This would be a proper language and  true policy for a free British parliament to adopt  "Hereupon"  says the reporter  Canutus presently withdrew his armies and within a while after he lost his crown  c  Here again the judge whoever he was that spoke betrayed a most  disloyal  preju∣dice in favour of  a government by arms and armies  which led him into a no∣torious falsehood for though the former part of the sentence is true that king Canute  "withdrew his armies"  yet the latter part that  within a while after he lost his crown  is totally  false  and the judge by asserting that  groundless  circumstance seemed inclined to insinu∣ate that  the withdrawing the armies  occa∣sioned the supposed  loss of the crown  which was far from being the case The great and noble Canute reaped the bene∣fit of his prudent and generous conformity to the free constitution of this  limited mo∣narchy  for he enjoyed a long and glori∣ous reign  after  he sent back his Danish  soldiers which according to Matthew of Westminster p was in the year and he held the crown with dignity and glory to the end of his life in the year when he was buried at Winchester with  royal pomp    regio more  ib p and his two sons also who separately succeeded him died like∣wise  kings of England  for they lost not the kingdom but by natural deaths and the want of heirs  Happy would it have been for Eng∣land had all succeeding kings been as wise and truly politic as the great Canute who feared not to commit the care of his own person and those of his foreign friends that attended him to the  free laws and limited constitution of this king∣dom  The old English maxim however against  a government by arms and ar∣mies  ought never to be forgotten  Odimus accipitrem quia semper vivit in armis    June    A GENERAL MILITIA ACTING BY A WELLREGULATED ROTATION IS THE ONLY SAFE MEANS OF Defending a free People  A GENERAL MILITIA ACTING BY A WELLREGULATED ROTATION IS THE ONLY SAFE MEANS OF Defending a free People  THE establishment of standing armies is perhaps the most dan∣gerous of all political expedients and has been fatal to the liberty of every na∣tion upon earth that has adopted it and therefore though the doctrine of  necessity  is generally pleaded to excuse the mea∣sure  yet there seems rather a  necessity  of absolutely rejecting it and of forming the national defence upon some other less dangerous plan  The service of a  national militia  may be divided into equal proportions of at∣tendance  by rotation  so as to inculcate and diffuse a sufficient knowledge of arms and military discipline throughout the whole body of a nation or people and thereby supersede the baneful  necessity  of keeping  regular troops or standing armies of mercenaries  Whenever the public safety demands the assembling and continuance of a large body of troops in actual service to watch and resist the motions of any powerful in∣vader a regular military  Roster of Service  from the  whole national mi∣litia  is the safest and best means of forming and continuing such an army in the field because it would be not only the least burthensome to individuals but  also less dangerous to the community at large for if the regularity of  rotation  were duly observed no man would be so long detained from his ordinary calling and occupation as to lose his  civil capa∣city  and way of livelihood at home nor be thereby unwarily drawn into a  separate interest  from his fellowcitizens which was unhappily the case of the Parliament's army in for after having bravely defended the  national liberty  for some years this very army became the instru∣ment of a most hateful national  bondage  under a military tyrant  The nature of a Roster is well descri∣bed by General Bland in his Treatise of military Discipline from p to When a great army is formed by several nations in alliance which send into the field each of them a different number of battalions a  Roster  is esteemed the best expedient for regulating and dividing the general service into due proportions  amongst them all and General Bland has given in p of the abovemen∣tioned Treatise the form of such  a Roster general for the detaching of bat∣talions according to that in Flanders in    He has also given  Tables of Proportion for detaching private men  that is for detaching them from the seve∣ral battalions in the field that the dan∣ger and fatigue of the service especially at sieges may be equally divided among them And nearly on the same plan tables might be formed for detaching the  individuals of a national militia from the several parishes or districts to which they belong in due proportion to the number of males enrolled in each of them  whereby the hardship and inconveniences of mili∣tary duty for the common safety would be equally divided among the whole na∣tion and of course the time of actual service would be most profitably diminish∣ed  to each individual whilst the know∣ledge of arms and discipline would be re∣gularly  circulated  into all parts of the country and with it also such a sensible perception to each individual of his fel∣lowship or incorporation with the whole national community as would plainly tend to prevent all partial and undue emu∣lation of particular counties or districts a∣gainst their neighbours for by such provincial jealousies the ancient states of Greece were unhappily disunited and their attention withdrawn from that true mutual interest and defence of each other without which none of them could long subsist in freedom whereas if on the contrary they had been inured to the so∣cial duty of serving in one common army drawn equally from each confederate state by a proper  "Table of Proportion"  and duly changed by  rotation  to pre∣vent them from becoming  mere soldiers  there would have been no just cause to  be jealous of each other's power as be∣tween the Athenians and Lacedaemoni∣ans  c  for all successes as well as losses would have been equally divided among them so that no particular state could have acquired by victory any en∣viable advantages peculiar to itself to in∣cite the jealousy of the rest but every individual in every part would by these means have been led to consider himself not merely as a member of a sin∣gle petty state or district but with a more enlarged idea of his own social cha∣racter as a member rather of the whole community of free citizens throughout all Greece for the circulation  A  Rotation  or general circulation of public duty may be compared to those  "wheels within wheels"  which give life vigour and activity to a  whole com∣munity  by enabling it howsoever extensive and scat∣tered with respect to local  situation  to move and ex∣ert itself as  one united living body  actuated by  one spirit  like as the hosts or armies of the commonwealth of Israel are typified by the Cherubim or  four  living creatures as represented in the standards of the four principal tribes united in  one animated  system of action moving altogether with wheels or rotations and wings  full of eyes  within and without  For in a state that is perfectly free and in such on∣ly the eyes of the several individuals of which it is composed are permitted to look forward with effect to the true interests of the community at large and may well be considered as the eyes figuratively represented in the whole body of the Cherubim and in all their parts their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels full of eyes round about every eye in that great united figurative body of the Cherubim help∣ing to  enlighten  the  intention  and thereby influence the motion or government of the whole  of the  Roster  would have been a most effectual bond of union to secure the connexion and communication of the most distant branches of the confederacy and by preserving the general body of the peo∣ple in their  civil capacity  and  ordinary occupations  it would also have rendered them less liable to be drawn from the common interest of the state at large partially to favour the arbitrary designs of any usurping commander in chief or pet∣ty tyrant for no generalofficer had such a confederacy of national union been  duly established would have been able to assume more power and authority than what was fairly delegated by the ma∣jority of suffrages in one  great united general council  of chosen citizens from e∣very part  The general body of individuals in such a case indeed submit themselves to serve by rotation the humble station of private soldiers but the time of ser∣vice being limited and  equal  to all men in duration it would be no great hard∣ship especially if each freeman that bears arms was allowed his  natural right  of suffrage in the state his due share of legislative influence to controul the commanders and regulate the service  In a nation consisting of six millions of souls which number England is com∣monly said to contain the number of males capable of bearing arms and who according to  natural right  are justly en∣titled also to a share in the legislature  would be estimated at a fourth part of that number according to the most ge∣neral mode of estimation  viz  men from which number a  Roster of ac∣tual service from home  only for one month each man in the space of a whole year would supply a constant army in the field of men if so many were necessary A continual change  every month  or every  fourteen days  of half a battalion at a time out of each district or still in smaller proportions  viz  a few companies at a time or even by halfcompanies from smaller divisions or pa∣rishes would be most adviseable that every part of the country might always re∣tain nearly the proportion of eleven parts out of twelve of its own militia as well for the purposes of guarding it as to carry on the ordinary culti∣vation and other necessary local occupa∣tions without interruption Persons a∣bove the common rank might serve in squadrons of horse if they preferred  that kind of service as  equites  or  es∣quires  Those men whose time of service approached as being next upon the es∣tablished  Roster  should be more carefully exercised  at home after the hours of la∣bour  for one month at least before their time of marching By these means they would be prepared for the service and the very march if properly conducted would add to their discipline The cer∣tainty of returning when relieved by companies of their neighbours in so short a time as  one month  if they lived so long or two months allowing for the march out and home would much reduce the anxiety of parting from their families and friends  It will probably be objected that a national militia which has been exercised only in small bodies is incapable of ef∣fectual service against an enemy but for this a remedy may be found Let the army be first formed in a separate en∣campment  at such convenient distance from the enemy that they may not be liable to an immediate attack  A central situation must of course be chosen for this camp of discipline where the several companies from the whole nation may be regimented under proper generalofficers and be daily ex∣ercised in  large bodies  for a whole month or six weeks if necessary be∣fore they are brought to face the enemy And for this reason it would be expe∣dient to require from each individual I mean the first time he is entered on the  Roster  one month or six weeks atten∣dance  more  than the generally esta∣blished proportion of time on the  Roster  which would be only once in his whole lifetime and therefore no great hard∣ship in order to be exercised with a large body of troops in some of the principal and most necessary movements and evolutions for the field and after the month or six weeks training in the camp of discipline  an army of men might be marched to the camp or camps of actual service to do duty for the time allotted to each upon the  Roster  against the com∣mon enemy and the number might be continually kept up by monthly detach∣ments of battalions from the first camp of discipline in proportion as the time of service allotted to each of the former companies upon the  Roster  should ex∣pire The country would also be guard∣ed by the returning disciplined compa∣nies dispersed in every part and the knowledge of arms and discipline by the time a  single circulation  of the  Roster  was completed  viz  in one year would be diffused throughout the  whole nation  which would thereby be enabled after∣wards to exert itself gloriously upon any sudden emergency for it might afford to bear even the loss of six such capital ar∣mies of  viz  in all men before it would be necessary to in∣crease the time of service from one month  to two months actual service for each disciplined man in a whole year With so small a portion of time employed in military service every man might pre∣serve his ordinary occupation either in trade or husbandry and maintain his rank and situation in life with his family as a  free citizen in his own district  at all other times when the  Roster  of public service did not demand his personal at∣tendance from home But when by a contrary method a national militia is so long continued in actual service without  rotation  as to inure the individuals to a neglect and disuse of their ordinary em∣ployments in their respective counties and districts they gradually lose their  civil capacity  and from  free citizens  are apt to become  mere soldiers  depen∣dent on their military  Sold  or sti∣pend and the favour of superiors where∣by they acquire such a slavish submission to COMMAND be it  just  or  unjust  that  they readily undertake to execute those very measures and designs which they themselves perhaps have previously condemned alledging that  a soldier has no right to judge for himself  thus indiscriminately applying to the general propriety or impropriety of any military undertaking a principle which proper∣ly relates only to the necessary discipline and mode of conducting it in the field after a man has absolutely consented and engaged to serve in it  and that a sol∣dier must go  say they  wherever he is ordered without any demur about the propriety or injustice of the service  So that they establish not only a  passive  but an  active obedience  to the will of others which makes the profession  dis∣honourable dishonourable  I mean in those who admit this doctrine of  unlimi∣ted obedience  which is derogatory to their  natural dignity as men  for they give up an indispensible quality of  human nature  the right of discerning between  good  and  evil  which is nothing less than a deser∣tion or apostatising from the duty which  every man  owes to God and his eternal laws and thereby render themselves and their profession the bane of every state where they are established and a disgrace to  human nature  REMARKS CONCERNING THE Trained Bands OF LONDON  REMARKS CONCERNING THE Trained Bands OF LONDON  THE Militia or Trained Bands of London have never been known to misbehave in  actual service  however despicable they may appear in their annual musters  Citizens of London from the most ancient times were required to keep arms in their houses The annual mus∣ter is rather a  muster of the arms  than of  the men  who would probably go out to  actual  service if there should be really occasion for them but even the meanest of  the men  as they now are generally sent out being for the most part substitutes if they were exercised for a few hours three times a week only for one month and restrained from the use of strong li∣quors during the time of exercise would be found more serviceable if there was any real occasion of public defence than is generally conceived  Of this real facts afford the best proof the irregularity of the Trained Bands and want of discipline were as conspicuous and notorious it seems in the year as at present for when Capt Skippon afterwards MajorGeneral was directed by the parliament to attend them as a guard with two companies of the  Trained Bands  of London Lord Clarendon's account of that matter is expressed in the folloWing contemptuous terms  This man  says he meaning Skippon  marched that day in the head of their  TUMULTUARY ARMY  to the parlia∣menthouse  Bk iv p  Yet Lord Clarendon himself makes ample reparation to the  Trained Bands  for this contempt when he speaks of their  unexpected  behaviour at the battle of Newbery for though he allows their  inexperience both of danger and service  he expressly attributes to the  steadiness  of the Trained Bands the preser∣vation of the parliament's army No troops in the kingdom had at that time been able to withstand the spirited char∣ges of Prince Rupert's welldisciplined horse till this  tumultuary army  which seems to be an exact description also of their present musters for the first time compelled them to wheel about  Rapin speaks of the brave defence of the  infantry  on that day in very high terms but without mentioning what par∣ticular troops they were so that no rea∣der would suspect that he described the  actions of the  "tumultuary army"  of the city  After the Prince had routed  the ca∣valry  of the enemy  says Rapin meaning the  parliament's cavalry    he fell upon their  infantry  which though deprived of the help of the cavalry received him with so much  intrepidity  that he was  repulsed  several times without being able ever to penetrate  Après avoir mis en deroute  la Cavalerie  des en∣nemis il alla tomber sur leur  Infanterie  qui bien que dénuée du secours de la Cavalerie le reçut avec tant d'intrepidi  é qu'il fut repoussé plusieurs fois sans qu'il pût jamais la percer  Rapin tom viii p  But Lord Clarendon candidly attributes the glory of the day to those whom he before despised as a  tumultuary army  "The London Trained Bands"  says he  and auxiliary regiments of whose  IN∣EXPERIENCE  of  DANGER  or  ANY KIND OF SERVICE  beyond the easy practice of their postures in the Artil∣lerygarden men had till then  TOO  CHEAP AN ESTIMATION  behaved themselves to wonder and were in truth the preservation of that army that day For they stood as a  BULWARK AND RAMPIRE TO DEFEND THE REST  whereby he attributes to them the chief resistance  and when their wings of horse were scattered and dispersed kept their ground  SO STEA∣DILY  that though Prince Rupert him∣self led up  THE CHOICE HORSE  to charge them and endured their storm of small shot he could make no impression upon their stand of pikes  BUT WAS FORCED TO WHEEL ABOUT  of so sovereign be∣nefit and use is that readiness order and dexterity in the use of their arms which hath been so much neglected  Bk VII p  Thus the  City Pikemen  are commend∣ed as a standard pattern of military disci∣pline viz for their  readiness order and dexterity in the use of arms  by  the very same historian who had entitled them  a tumultuary army  a very short time before this occasion which extorted his commendation A moderate and suffi∣cient discipline for real service is more easily and sooner acquired than people generally conceive and nothing is want∣ing to the present establishment of City Trained Bands but more frequent mus∣ters for about an hour or an hour and a half at a time  after the hours of labour  for if they were allowed this advantage they would be nearly upon the same foot∣ing as the Militia of New England Con∣necticut  c  which lately conquered the welldisciplined army of General Bur∣goyne they would be nearly upon the  same footing  I say except in one point which is that the  New England Militia  have always maintained the ancient con∣stitutional right of choosing their own officers in the public  Folkmotes  which the learned Judge Atkins by the best autho∣rities  has proved to be the original consti∣tution of our national Militia Polit Tracts p  The present establishment of the  county regiments of Militia  savours too much of a  standing army  both in  disci∣pline  and  the effect  of the service upon the  common men  who by being absent too long a time from their families and ordinary occupations are apt to become  mere soldiers  despising their former trades and employments and consequently  cea∣sing to be citizens  Nothing surely can be more dange∣rous to a free state than such  an effect  as this for the  professed soldier  generally gives up to superior COMMAND  Command  is properly  imperium  the essence of  em∣pire  for the title of  imperator  or  emperor  originally signified nothing more than  the commander in chief of the army  and though this power of  command  was gene∣rally delegated at first by the election and appointment of the people or senate and of course was esteemed subject to their controul yet by the usurpations of suc∣cessful military chiefs when the forces under their command have been detained so long in actual service as to lose their  civil capacity  and become a  standing army  of mere  soldiers  dependent on their  sold  or military pay instead of their former  civil  connections and useful occupations it has always been liable to be changed from a  limited command  to  "merum imperium"  or  abso∣lute dominion  which Leopold Metastafius a learned Roman Advocate very properly stiles  "belluina potestas"  a  beastly  power a term which most aptly characterizes the  enormity  and consequent  illegality  of  unlimited mo∣narchy  And this use of the term  belluina potestas  is strictly  legal  and justifiable because it is the  very mark  by which the prophets of God have branded all the ar∣bitrary dominations of mankind from the Babylo∣nian head of the great and terrible image of Tyranny down to  its very toes  the present divided kingdoms of the earth which still exist in power and must so con∣tinue for some little time longer for the punishment and destruction of depraved man until it shall please God in his mercy to break them in pieces by  his eter∣nal kingdom  which will then  become a mountain  or earthly establishment of government  and fill the whole earth  Dan ii For all the said temporal em∣pires and kingdoms are included in the prophetic repre∣sentation of  four great and terrible beasts  see Dan vii so that the  belluina potestas  is undeniably attributed to  all of them  and that we may more clearly demonstrate that the term denotes a power unlimited by law and due popular controul it is necessary to remark that the characteristical property of each of these  beastly  em∣pires is "  to do according to his  WILL" that is with∣out limitation of  law right  or other  just controul  in favour of the people such  unlimited  WILL at is called  "absolute"  i e  "loosed from"  all due restraint of the people or other  obligation  whatsoever This  bestial  mark of  absolute will  was the characteristical property of the  first beast  the Babylonian head or  winged lion  of the Chaldees "  whom he  WOULD" NAY the proper Chaldee word for WILL both verb and noun  he slew and whom he  WOULD      he kept alive and whom he  WOULD    again  he set up and whom he  WOULD    once more  "he put down"  Dan v So that the  will  of the monarch was manifestly the  only law  of that empire and the unhappy effects of such  unlimited  power even to the  monarch himsself  is strongly marked in the very next verse  But when his heart was lifted up  the natural conse∣quence of such undue exaltation  An excellent antidote against the evil of  royal will  or  undue exaltation  is prescribed in Deut xvii viz That the king shall  "write out for himself a copy"  or rather a  duplicate    "of this law"  i e those written laws of God which had  twice  been solemnly  read  not only in the presence but  in the ears  or hearing  of  ALL  the people  and had as often been solemnly confirmed at each  public reading  by the voluntary assent of  all the people  saying  "all that the Lord hath said will we do"  Exodus xxiv Thus the divine laws became the regular  statutes  of that nation  And it"  viz the king's own written duplicate of the law  shall be with him and be shall read therein all the day of his life that be may learn to fear the Lord his God  TO KEEP ALL THE WORDS OF THIS LAW AND THESE STATUTES TO DO THEM  and the rea∣son of thus  limiting  the ROYAL WILL by laws and statutes is assigned in the very next sentence  that  HIS HEART BE NOT LIFTED UP ABOVE HIS BRETHREN  and that he turn not aside from the command∣ment  to  the right band or  to  the left  which is surely a strict  li∣mitation  of the  regal power  a measure highly important to the true in∣terst even of the monarch himself viz  to the end that he may pro∣long  his  days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of Is∣rael  And in like manner the kings of all Christian nations should be  limited by the same statutes  excepting only those statutes which were merely  ceremonial  or  temporary  And they should be still farther  limited  by the more perfect  statutes  of the Christian revelation without being allowed the least power of WILL or prerogative to  turn aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left  that the decla∣red purposes of the Gospel in behalf of man viz  on earth  PEACE  good will towards men  may be  effectually established  and that  the  WILL of our heavenly Father which is always  righteousness  and  peace  may  "be done on earth as it is in heaven"  for that is the true effect of the approaching  kingdoms of God on earth  which all Christians are taught to promote by their daily prayers But the princes of the world under the influence of our spiritual enemy the  dragon  which hath given his power to  the beast  do openly oppose the  effectual  esta∣blishment of  God's kingdom on earth  by impiously claiming to them∣selves a  royal prerogative  to  make  WAR  or peace  without the advice and assent of the people or congregation which is manifestly to  LIFT UP THEIR HEARTS ABOVE THEIR BRETHREN  and of course  "the earth it"  once more  "filled with violence"  see p whereby the  royal  promoters of it are rendered dreadfully obnoxious to the vengeance and retribution of the Almighty when his approaching  kingdom  shall  come "to destroy the destroyers of the earth"    Rev xi But if kings would be contented to govern with  legal  authority i e authority  duly limited  by the  uninflu∣enced  representation of each nation or people  freely  and  equally  elected for  every session  of each national council and would after the example of king Canute magnanimously rely under God on their national hosts of free armed citizens instead of  standing armies  for the securi∣ty of their  crowns  they would stand clear of the heavy judgements de∣nounced against  the body of the beast  and would have no cause to fear the approaching  kingdom of God  nor the irresistible stroke by which it will  break in pieces  the whole image of tyranny and  "cut off all the horns"  or crowns  "of the wicked"  Psa lxxv and lxxvi for  legal  kings are effectually secured by the scripture promises in favour of RIGHTEOUSNESSviz that  "the horns"  or rather  crowns    of  THE RIGHTEOUS  shall be exalted  Psa lxxv so that they may truly hope to  reign with the just  when  the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom  UNDER THE WHOLE HEAVEN  shall be gi∣ven to the people of the saints of the Most High  c Dan vii    and his mind hardened in  PRIDE  he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him and he was dri∣ven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the  BEASTS  a notable instance of God's vengeance against the  belluina potestas  of royal  will  and  pleasure  "  and his dwelling was with the  WILD ASSES"  c  Dan v  c  By this very  example  did the holy prophet reprove a wicked and  unbridled  descendant of the same monarch just before the total dissolution of his empire as he had also previously warned the royal ancestor himself to  break off his sins by  RIGH∣TEOUSNESS  c  which would have effectually restored  due limitations  to his government and destroyed the baneful  "belluina potestas"  which occasioned the warning but the counsel was neglected and of course the monarch was humbled and his empire ruined for then were the  wings of the  BEAST of Babylon plucked  and his dominion taken away  Dan vii  Absolute will  was also the essential property of the succeeding empire or the  second beast viz  the MedoPersian monarchy described elsewhere under the figure of an impetuous  ram  which pushed westward and northward and southward  so that no  BEASTS  might stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but  the prophet now adds the principal  bestial  or  brutal  mark  HE DID AC∣CORDING TO HIS WILL  and became great  Dan viii For after the Persian monarchs had once ac∣quired the baneful  "belluina potestas"  by the establish∣ment of  standing armies  in every province even the onceboasted  laws of the Medes and Persians  became as vague and uncertain as the  royal will and pleasure  to which they were of course subjected howsoever  un∣changeable  they might have been reputed in the com∣mencement of that empire  Neither was the  third beast  the cruel  fourheaded fly∣ing leopard  of the Grecian empire without the same characteristical mark of  absolute will  though it is not expresly annexed to Daniel's description of that com∣pound of Tyranny in his seventh chapter but in the farther description of the Grecian empire chap xi v the same  wilful  or  unlimited  dominion is clearly foretold  A mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion  and then follows the mark of the beast "  and shall do according to his  WILL"  The king mentioned in the th verse that  shall do according to his  WILL  and exalt himself and magnify himself above every God  is generally understood to denote the  fourth and last beast  or  empire  which  still ex∣ists  being that most noxious and tremendous beast with  iron teeth  described in Dan vii  which devour∣ed brake in pieces and stamped the residue under his feet  i e  in the most violent and  beastlike  manner which is plainly to "  do according to his  WILL" We see then how aptly  unlimited command  or  merum impe∣rium  is expressed by the term  "belluina potestas"  The  unlimited will  of a king is so great an abomina∣tion in the eye of the  English Commonlaw  that the ex∣ercise of it in this country is declared to be an effectual disqualification or abasement from the  regal  dignity  for there is  NO KING  where  WILL  governs and not law    Non est enim rex ubi dominatur  VOLUNTAS  et non lex  Bract lib i c  A king of England  ceases to be king  when  he ceases to be limited by the  LAW for it is a rule of the com∣monlaw that  "a king can do nothing" i e  by virtue of his office  on earth while he is the minister and vicar of God except that alone which  BY LAW  he may    "Nihil enim potest rex in terris"  c  nisi id solum quod de  JURE  potest  c See the note in pages and And therefore when the law is  suspend∣ed  or set aside which is the highest and most bane∣ful  injustice  the king's power ceases to be  "ae jure"  for in the eye of the law he is esteemed  Minister di∣aboli dum declinet ad injuriam  so that he and his ministers reduce themselves thereby to the common level of all other bad men and whatsoever  power  or  force  in that case they may be able to exert has no better foundation than the temporary power of banditti which may be lawfully and conscientiously resisted by all men  A king of England therefore though he is  supreme  or  sovereign  in personal dignity and rank yet he is  not so  in will and power because in these the law to avoid the  belluina potestas  of  absolute monarchy  requires that he should be duly  limited  by the people a necessary distinction this respecting  supremacy  of which the un∣fortunate K Cha I seems not to have been aware or he would not with his dying breath have denied the people's right to a  share in the government  saying  It is not for having share in government sir that is nothing pertaining to them a subject and a  SOVEREIGN  are clear different things  c  and so they certainly are with respect to  personal dignity  or  rank  when com∣pared  as individuals  and yet the  sovereignty  or  supreme power  belongs of right to the people i e to the ma∣jority of them or to the majority of their duly elected representatives  "And therefore"  we may say with that learned casuist Bp Taylor in his Ductor Dubi∣tantium lib iii c rule p  it is but a weak and useless distinction when we speak of kings and princes by them meaning the  SUPREME POWER  to say that some are  ABSOLUTE  some are  LIMITED  in their power  That is the distinction is weak and useless only when we mean to speak of the  supreme power  this is clearly the bishop's meaning as the following con∣text will shew for otherwise the distinction to be made between  absolute  and  limited "kings and princes"  is so far from being  weak  and  useless  that it is the necessary and proper criterion between the  illegal  and  legal  dominion of kings the  limited  alone being  legal  in this kingdom  For  the bishop adds  it is true that some princes are so  i e  are  LIMITED  in their power "but then"  says he  they "are  NOT  the  SUPREME  power"  This is directly to the point in question and he adds a farther illustration of it  It is a contradiction  says he  to say that the  SUPREME POWER  is limited or restrained for that which  RE∣STRAINS  it is  SUPERIOR  to it and therefore the other is  NOT SUPREME  That a king ought not to have the  supreme power  is clearly laid down by the best wri∣ters on the English  Common Law  and particularly by Judge Bracton one of the most ancient as well as the most respectable authorities  Rex sub Deo et Lege Rex habet  SUPERIOREM  Deum  scilicet  item  LE∣GEM  per quam factus est rex item  CURIAM SUAM  viz comes barones  c Bract lib c xvi p  "Lex fraenum est potentiae"  c  That such a power of RESTRAINT is vested in the LAW as well as in the LEGISLATORS of this  limited  monarchy is clearly proved by Mr Acherley in his book on free parliaments He argues from the words of the  original writs of summons to parliament  that the  determining or decisive power  demanded by the said writs  ad faciendum ea  i e the insuperable and urgent busi∣nesses for which the parliament is called is  derived from the people  and is  independent  and his inference is good and he gives a remarkable instance of this  inde∣pendent power in the people  which is their answer to the pope respecting the banishment of Adomar Bp of Win∣chester in Ann Hen Viz  Si dominus rex et regni majores hoc vellent COMMUNITAS tamen ipsius Adomar ingressum in Angliam jam nullatenus sustineret  That if the king and lords would do this thing meaning if they would revoke the banish∣ment  yet the commons  WOULD NOT SUFFER  or bear Adomar's  residence in England  And the commons caused their speaker Petrus de Montford  'vice totius communitatis'  to sign and he did sign this answer  p  From this example therefore as well as from a great multitude of other instances of the power of the  English commons  it is manifest that there is  no supreme power  in England without the concurrence and assent of  the peo∣ple  not a  general assent  once for all to throw  the supre∣macy  into other hands but an  especial assent  for every new circumstance that may be liable to affect their in∣terest For which cause also parliaments ought indis∣pensably to be newly elected  every session  according to ancient usage i e  every year once and more often if need be  and that in as  equal  a proportion of  representation  as possible because the more  equitable  in this point it is made the more conducive it will surely be to the happiness and true permanent interest both of king and people  But if on the contrary by the modern  innovations  of  triennial  and  septennial  elections reduction of the right of voting venality of almost depopulated boroughs  c  the  supreme power  should be gradually corrupted it must become a  supreme  evil to the destruction of  good government  and  peace  for in such a corrupted state nothing can thrive under it but  standing armies  and that which always regularly attends their establishment throughout all the branches of the fourth or Roman tyranny I mean the  belluina potestas  of imperial  will  and  command  against which the vengeance of the Al∣mighty is clearly denounced so that those persons who yield themselves instruments to promote either the one or the other are guilty of the grossest impiety A free militia therefore is the only just and legal means of internal national defence  that indis∣pensible  human right of judging between  good  and  evil  which alone constitutes  the distinction between  men  and  brutes  and through a false notion of military  honour the soldier is apt to think that his duty requires an  implicit active obedi∣ence  on all occasions whereby  the standing armies  of all nations are con∣stantly  and regularly the tools of despo∣tism and the bane of all good and limi∣ted government  A  national militia  therefore ought to be constituted upon principles as op∣posite  to those of  standing armies  as pos∣sible and no rules or arrangements  whatever that may tend to detach men from their ordinary callings and employ∣ments  as  free citizens  ought on any account to be admitted  The CityMilitia even upon its pre∣sent establishment was always respecta∣ble when  real service  was wanted  HINTS OF SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHICH MAY BE USEFUL TO Military Associations  HINTS OF SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHICH MAY BE USEFUL TO Military Associations  AS the sole purpose of  Military As∣sociations  is to support the  Civil Magistrate  and to join  the power of the countie  when legally summoned by sheriffs  c for common defence  it is ne∣cessary that each associated company be formed upon principles as opposite to those of  standing armies  valour and good discipline excepted as can possibly be devised  The  freedom  and  equal  natural rights of individuals and the preservation of their  civil capacity  must therefore be considered as objects of the utmost impor∣tance and consideration in order to which  the freedom of election  in the ap∣pointment of  officers  and a  frequent re∣newal of choice  therein are absolutely necessary to be maintained  Let the whole corps of Associators in every neighbourhood or  vicinage  di∣vide themselves into small bodies of ten persons each in their respective districts and let each ten or decennary choose from among themselves a  tithingman  or serjeant to superintend the discipline of the ten and to receive and communi∣cate to them all summonses from the Ci∣vil Magistrate or orders from the  Com∣mittee of Association  and to transact such other business as the nature of the  Associ∣ation  may require the power of the ser∣jeants nevertheless to be subject to the con∣troul  of a majority of the ten who choose them respectively and no other  military  of∣ficers should be appointed except officers of  Platoons  for a single day viz when the corps is divided into Platoons for exercise agreeable to the mode recommended by General Bland p at which time each platoon ought to choose its own leader whose power should cease with that day's exercise An experienced per∣son must however be chosen at a pre∣vious general meeting to instruct and di∣rect the corps in the general manoeuvres and evolutions of the field who should from time to time be appointed  Com∣mandingofficer of the day  In times of actual service the LordMayor or ei∣ther of the sheriffs that are present must be considered as the legal commander of the association  As three decennaries or serjeants guards will be the proper complement for a  pla∣toon  so two platoons or six decennaries  being sixty men will be a convenient number for a  company  and ten such com∣panies a sufficient number for a  battalion  or ward division as it will be equal to two townships or two county hundreds  There should be  within  each ward se∣veral places appointed for drilling or teach∣ing  the common exercise  to  small parties  and also one place more spacious for those that are become expert in handling their arms to be taught  the platoon ex∣ercise  to form themselves into compa∣nies to march wheel  c  But if a place cannot be found  within the ward  sufficiently spacious for such a  general ex∣ercise  of the whole body it is probable that two or three places may be found therein sufficient for the exercise of  single companies  or at least of  single platoons  which should be appropriated accordingly and none of these places of exercise should be open to the inspection of strangers as it must be irksome to gentlemen to be over∣looked  before they have acquired some tolerable knowledge of the military disci∣pline One place of  general rendezvous  should likewise be appointed  within each ward  for the neighbours to assemble in case of any sudden alarm  To prevent the individuals of the Asso∣ciation from being injured in their  civil  ca∣pacity care must be taken that the times of  drilling and private exercise  be appoint∣ed both before and after the usual hours of labour and that an option be given to the learners of attending either at the  mor∣ning  or  evening exercise  as shall be most convenient to themselves that no man may be induced to neglect or injure his ordi∣nary calling or  occupation  by which his  civil capacity  is maintained and for the same reason the times of  public exercise in larger bodies  should not be  more fre∣quent  than is absolutely necessary for ac∣quiring  a moderate and useful discipline  rather than a critical nicety in the military  manoeuvres which latter would take up more time than  men of business  can usu∣ally spare and which must finally have the bad effect of tiring out many of the most useful members of society and therefore it is not only necessary to re∣strain the  too great frequency  of such meet∣ings but also the  duration  of each meet∣ing that as little time may be lost to the individuals as possible and that those who attend may not incur the necessity of  taking any refreshment whatsoever  while they are out  on exercise  or in  going  or  re∣turning  which would otherwise occa∣sion many inconveniences too obvious to be mentioned besides an  unnecessary ex∣pence  to individuals which ought cer∣tainly to be avoided in large  promiscuous  societies because  all  cannot  equally  afford it But if any man has acquired so de∣praved an appetite that he cannot endure four or six hours exercise and a general review if properly conducted will not  require more time  without taking food or liquor  he ought to be esteemed totally unqualified for the Association till he can cure himself of such an  unmanly  and disgraceful habit which is entirely in∣consistent with the  military duty  even of  a citizen  Single decennaries single platoons or even single companies should not be per∣mitted to march into the country  with their arms and uniforms  by way of ex∣ercise or  amusement to themselves  without an express leave given by a general meeting of the associators nor without due caution to be taken for preserving good order by the attendance of a suffi∣cient number of peaceofficers to prevent any disputes or affrays with strangers lest the indiscretion of a few individuals of the corps on such an excursion should injure the reputation of the whole body of associators And the third rule given by a very ingenious and learned  writer in a tract entitled  An Inquiry into the legal Mode of suppressing Riots  should be strictly observed that the As∣sociation should  not  UNNECESSARILY  march through streets or highroads nor make any the least  MILITARY PARADE  but consider themselves entirely as a part of the  CIVIL STATE  And they ought also carefully to observe the caution referred to by his fifth rule respecting the use of  arms in suppressing  RIOTS  viz  that it is extremely hazardous for pri∣vate persons to proceed to those extremi∣ties in common cases  and that they should not attend to any  private  person that shall  PRESUME  to raise the power of the county which is the province of the sheriff undersheriff or magistrate  but let them wait for a  legal  summons from those that have the proper authority before they  take their arms  to assist in keeping the peace though they have  certainly a right to assemble as  neighbours without their arms  to consult and use all peaceable endeavours to allay or pre∣vent the ill consequences of any sudden commotion that has occasioned an alarm  By the constitution of this kingdom as well as by many express laws still in force  apprentices wards and indeed lay∣men of all ranks and conditions from fifteen to sixty years of age  are required  to have arms  and be duly  exercised  in the use of them for the national defence See p It would therefore well become the housekeepers of every ward and par∣ticularly those who are members of any wardassociation to encourage their  ap∣prentices servants  and  dependents  to learn their  military exercise  with the common  militiaarms  belonging to each house at such places in the ward as may be appointed for that purpose the ex∣pence of which should first be defrayed  by the respective  wardassociations  until the utility of the measure is rendered ob∣vious to the wards at large that the housekeepers at each wardmote maybe induced to adopt it For by these means the housekeepers might always have a sufficient number of able and wellinstructed  substi∣tutes to serve for them in the militia  which would thereby be rescued from the oppro∣brium of  incapacity  with which it has so frequently of late been charged and the necessity of any  new reform of the CityMilitia  which might be attended with very dangerous consequences to the rights and liberties of citizens would be there∣by precluded And if in case of any more tumults or riots  an armed Citywatch  should again be thought necessary these disciplined  Militiasubstitutes in each ward  might be enrolled in a  Roster  for that particular service under the proper Militiaofficers and their attendance might be so divided and diminished by  a due  Roster  as to be very little burthen∣some to the individuals enrolled where∣by a small stipend to each for the time of his actual attendance would be suffi∣cient to render the service  voluntary  Or  Volunteers  might be invited by rewarding a certain adequate proportion of  watchduty  with the  free∣doms of the city  and by ordaining that no artificer or journeyman employed in the city be molested as a  Nonfreeman  provided he enters himself a  Volunteer  on the watchroll of the ward wherein he is employed  The appearance also of the City Mi∣litia might be rendered more respectable by the addition of  drilljackets  with some proper distinction of  uniform facings  to denote the ward or district of each
