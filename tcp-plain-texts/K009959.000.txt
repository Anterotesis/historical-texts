 THE  British Visions  OR  ISAAC BICKERSTAFF  Sen  Being TWELVE PROPHESIES FOR THE YEAR  Enter'd into the HallBook of the Company of STATIONERS  Printed in the  North  and Reprinted at  London  and Sold by J BAKER at the  BlackBoy  in  PaterNosterRow  Price  d    THE PREFACE  IN the Year  Isaac Bickerstaff    Esq  the Prophet who formrrly Prophesied and Foretold you so many Remarkable Things  viz  in the Year all which as is well known are most exactly come to pass and having by my Knowledge and Acquaintance for above One Hundred Years with the Stars and with utmost diligence applied my self to know by the Aspects of Heavenly Bodies and other Methods also what shall happen on the Earth I say that I the aforesaid  Isaac Bickerstaff    Esq  am moved as well by Astrological Vision as the especial  Genius  of those Powers which influences human Bodies to make known to the World what shall come to pass  By this Prophetick Skill I once amongst other well known Events Predicted and Foretold you That  John Partridge  the Almanackmaker should Die and be Buried on or before such a day of the Month which as you all know came to pass to a Moment  Having therefore obtained such an undoubted Skill and Judgment in these most useful and advantageous Things I can no longer refrain from letting my Countrymen of this Nation know the great Revolutions of Kingdoms and States and the dreadful Things that shall suddenly come to pass in the Earth I am also the more earnestly moved to this great and wonderful Vndertaking because it is revealed to me by the same wonderful Prophetick Skill that such great and terrible Things such surprizing Events and such Dessolations are preparing in the World and shall come to pass this ensuing Year as were never seen by the Eyes of any Living or would enter into the Conceptions of any Man to foretell had they not by an extraordinary acquired Skill in knowing and determining such Things been foreseen by me  Isaac Bickerstaff    Esq  Sen  And thus honest Reader being nothing doubting of thy diligent Attention to what I shall Prophesie I bid thee Farewell  The  British Visions  or  Isaac Bickerstaff  's Twelve Prophesies for the Year  PROPHECY I  I Shall begin my Years of Wonders as the Course of Nature begins it Councils and Confederacies act all the Courts and Princes of  Europe  and the time of Year is only for such Things but as here the Seeds of Blood are sown the plentiful Crop that is to follow derives from and is produced by the Private Combinations of Men and Devils to disturb the World  Three Scenes of Council shall this Month discover themselves in the World what the Production or Effects shall be of either of them I shall farther lay open in my next these are Councils in this Nation Councils of  France  Councils of  Mahomet  The Councils of this Nation shall produce great Strife Faction and Malecontent stirs with Heat and Animosities among the several Parties that are among us to the great Encouragement of our Enemies and to the great Discouragement of good Men yet the Calmness and Prudence of some shall lessen or at least protract the Danger for a while Disputes of Ecclesiastick Affairs shall embroil this Island and those People who regard neither God nor Devil shall make the greatest stir about Religion every Church however safe cries out they are in danger and the Debauchees of the Nation learn to play the Pharisee and say to their Neighbour  Stand off I am holier than thou  Let  Europe  tremble at what is contriving now in the Cabinets of Princes which like the Seeds of Distempers  in the Body will quickly break out in Feavors Fluxes Cankers Calentures and all the Symbals of the Bodily Distempers of Men in the Politicks of Nations  France  consults now how to support  Spain  embroil the Emperor bring home the  Swede  restore  Bavaria  doze  Savoy  fright the  Dutch  and divide the  English  and he will in some Measure accomplish them all  The  Turk  consults how to humble the  Muscovite  subject the  Pole  and keep fast the King of  Sweden  but the  Swede  will make a Cats Foot of the  Turk  play him a slipery Trick get out of his hands and leave him to fight with the  Muscovites  and  Poles  where the War shall be bloody cruel successful to neither side and only useful to shew God's Judgments on both  PROPHECY II  After Consultations comes Preparation this takes up all  Europe  with the Return of the Spring every Nation Struggles with themselves to make their Preparations for War formidable and with one another to be first ready for the Bloody Work they are about  The Confederates attempt vigorously to succour King  Charles  in  Spain  but  O the Success    Spain  not yet ripe for Deliverance resists her Friends embraces her Enemies and struggles hard against what she believes she must at last submit to  But this is not the Generation that must enjoy the Fruit of this Strife the Chiefs fight for the Possession neither part obtain it both take their long Journey before the War is over and the Game at Chess is left to Posterity to play it out  Philip  goes first I  Isaac Bickerstaff  Elder having the Second sight see the famous Mausoleum for the young Hero of  Bourbon  in the Escurial at  Madrid  and there lies the hope of a Crown yet the  French  Monarch with the same Obstinacy supports the War maintains the Breach and prompts the  Spaniards  still to defend themselves against their own Happiness  Philip  before he dies fights three Battles with the Confederates and is Victor in two of them but dies in  May  and leaves the War to be carried on with less Success than before should it be left to the Merits of the Persons  Philip  deserves the Crown of  Spain  far better than  Ch  s  as he appears active valiant brave and unwearied in the Face of his Enemies however he dies King and Sleeps in Peace tho' he never Reigned so  Now the  Swedes  prepare to break out of  Pomeren  and it appears that  France  and the  Swedes  are in a strict Confederacy and they shall be more fatal to  Europe  than the League with the  Turk  The  Swedes  sending Forces from  Stockholm  carry the Plague into  Pomerania  from whence it spreads to the utmost Corners of  Europe  Kings and Emperors shall flye from this dreadful Enemy but find no Recess Plague finds them out and as War spreads Pestilence goes hand in hand and both shall consume and destroy without Mercy  Europe  is all busie in fitting out their Armies the Drums beat in every Kingdom for Soldiers not a Prince or State in this whole part of the World but shall be embark'd in the Quarrels of  Europe  and be engag'd in War either as Principal or as Auxilary  The Armies of  France  and  Spain  are in the Field first and much Blood shall be shed in  Spain  before the end of  February  The Confederates Struggle hard but Things do not answer the Expence  PROPHECY III  The Preparations for War are finish'd now the Troops on all sides appear in the Field a third Battle in  Spain    Philip  's Forces flie in their Turn tho' no great advantage made of the Victory In  March  the  French  make two great Efforts upon the  Rhine  one to join the  Swede  who Marches towards the  Elbe  and the  French  towards  Saxony  the other towards  Bavaria  and the  Germans  in no readiness to receive them suffer all manner of Mischiefs  The Dauphin of  France  dies the Pope sickens and is very weak the Duke of  Savoy  relapses but the King of  France  more vigorous than ever pushes all before him the beginning of Summer  A great Prodigy appears in the East two Kings struggling to make it appear which was the better Christian he that changed his Religion to gain a Crown or he that flies to  Mahomet  to recover his Crown The  Turks  advance now in three great Armies and one Battle is fought before the end of  March  in which the King of  Sweden  gains some ground but is wounded in the Action and makes no Advantage of the Battle  Now the miserable Fate of  Europe  approaches the War begins in  Poland    Muscovy    Hungary  on the  Rhine  and in  Spain  In  Flanders  and  Savoy  they cannot be ready so soon  A great Battle on the Frontiers of  Portugal  in which the  Portuguese  do as they use to do  viz  run away the  Spaniards  ravage  Portugal  ruin three Provinces if these were not  Portuguese  the  Spaniards  had not had the Victory and if these were not  Spaniards  the  Portuguese  would be no more a Kingdom but the sloth of the  Spaniards  saves  Portugal  till  England  relieve her  A great Minister of State dies in the Month of  March  England  feels great want of Trade great want of Money and great loss of Credit which puts her to many Inconveniencies but let her prepare for worse Things than these  PROPHECY IV  Note  In this place in the Original Manuscript the following Paragraph was Inserted which the Printer in the  North  declin'd to put in for fear of giving Offence  The Words are these  The House of  Austria  feels a Blow this Month which Changes the Measures of  Europe  The Emperor resigns to Fate and the Choise both of a new Emperor and new King of  Spain  takes up the Consultations of all the Courts in Christendom  The Empire feels hard Things beset on every side and weak in Arms as well as confused in Council the  Swedes  and the  French  invade  Bavaria  the  Hungarians  supported by the  Turks  recover all they have lost in  Hungary  the  French  make a terrible Eruption over the  Rhine  the Circles of  Swabia  and  Franconia  suffer incredible Evils and Blood Famine and Pestilence rages over the Empire  The Duke of  Bavaria  restored to his Dominions by the  French  dies of the Plague in  April  and the Affairs of that Electorate come to some Settlement by the succeeding of his Son who has other Things to mind than War The Elector of  Cologn  Brother to the  Bavarian  goes to see his Brother reinstated but lives not to return to his own Principality  The Emperor retreats from  Vienna  for fear of the  Turks  and  Hungarians  and goes to  Prague  but the Plague gets into  Bohemia  and separates the Imperial Court some great Princes die of that Distemper also  In the Month of  April  a great City in  Flanders  besieged by the  French  but the Confederates coming on they raise their Siege they are made amends by surprizing another strong Town in the middle of the Day A Bloody Action in  Flanders  between part of the Armies in which the  French  seem to have the Advantage but decline coming to a decisive Battle and draw off from the Field Death in this Battle puts an end to the Ambition of two or three great Men on either side  Bousslers  lies now in the Bed of Honour and his Grace  shall bear him Company into the other World so he that was envied before shall be pitied now for want of a Rival  In the same  April  King  Philip  's Forces Bombard  Barcelona  but Relief comes to King  Charles  and in his turn he chases them now the Face of Things change in  Spain  and  Philip  's Fate approaches  The  Danes  now prepare to invade  S  nen  and make another fruitless Attempt upon the King of  Sweden  's Countries from whence they are again beaten and bring  back Poverty and the Plague which not only visits their Capital City but makes sad havock in their Court not excepting the Royal Family  The King of  P  demits his Crown in favour of his Son and submits to go the way of all Princes This Year is fatal to Crownd Heads  PROPHECY V  Now  Europe  begins to Tremble the People find an Employment different from the War the Living having Work enough to Bury their Dead  By the end of  May  the various kinds of this new Plague has Touch'd most parts of  Europe  The  Swedes  as before bring it to  Pomeren  thence they carry it to  Saxony Via Brandenburgh  the  Saxons  give it to the  Bohemians  the  Bohemians  to the  Bavarians  they to the  Grisons  and they again to the  Smiss  The  Hungarians  bring it another way from  Poland  and carrying it into  Croatia  it Crosses the  Adriatick  to  Italy  and siezes upon the  Venetian  from thence it pushes into  Milan  and visiting  Turin  it passes thro'  Rome  to the Kingdom of  Naples  and in spight of the interruption of Commerce by the War crosses over into  Sicily  Innumerable Numbers of People shall perish by this desolating Distemper yet the World as if the Hand of Heaven did not or could not destroy them fast enough still make War and the Kings of the Earth apply themselves to their ruinous Designs with as much fury as ever  The King of  Sweden  now appears in his own Colours and shall in the Month of  May  be in full march to enter  Poland  if not  Germany  but his Army consisting of many Nations new raised and undisciplin'd wasts away without much Fighting and he may see that Heaven does not bless his Ambitious Designs with success answerable to his Expectations Three of his greatest Generals and in whom was his chief Confidence die of the Plague and tho' he gains some advantage he can make no great use of it his power being lessened by the other Accidents of War  The  Turks  and the  Muscovite  Men of a side draw towards one another but the Decisive Stroke is not yet many bloody Skirmishes happen between the  Tartars  and the  Cossacks  against the  Muscovite  The Month of  May  lays King  Philip  low in  Spain  and  Charles  Triumphs over his Enemy a third time but his Joy like all Temporal things is but of a small duration The War in  Spain  costs much Money much Blood much Counsel but does not fully answer our end Many a brave  English  Man leaves his Bones in that Country whose Blood might have been better spent  Another Bloody Action between the Armies on the side of  Germany  in which much Blood is lost and both sides give GOD praise for being beaten  This Year is a Year rather of Blood than of Victory no  Bleinhim  no  Pultowa  No Decisive Battle happens any where on this side  Hungary  yet more Men killed than would be in many such Battles  PROPHECY VI  As the hot Weather comes on Men's Blood grows warm this subjects and exposes them to fatal mischiefs the plague of War and the War of Plague  Italy  and  Germany  have by this time felt the fury of the Contagion and dreadful Ravages have been made in all the populous Nations on that side  Shall  Britain  be free flatter not your selves with Expectations of it many Plagues visit this Nation and whole Parties of Men suffer the Infection all sorts of Men shall die some politickly some really the Grave makes no Distinction of  Whigg  or  Tory  High or Low  Church  Three Bishops go off the Stage first Dukes Earls Barons and PrivyCounsellors follow a great Rot falls among the CourtSheep and the Murrain upon the Stallions of this  Sodomitish  City The Infection spares none But alas for the Sheepherds of our Flocks they fly and leave their Flocks to be scatter'd  But let them remember it from  Isaac Bickerstaff  's Words the Sheepherds that forsake the Sheep committed to their  Charge shall fall in their flight when those that stay shall remain In this general Desolation it is not difficult for me to Name you Persons by Titles and Sirnames that shall be infected with Plagues of one sort and another whose Eyes shall not see the end of these things but the Number is too great and you cannot bear the distinction of Persons at this time  Let it be sufficient then to tell you Your Desolation is beyond expression and the Number whose Carkasses shall fall in this Wilderness is not to be Number'd  Yet for the encouragement and support of the Poor Heaven promises Plenty in the Fields and there shall be no want of Bread Food shall encrease tho' not the Mouths that feed on it and what the Sword or other Plagues shall devour shall leave room for those that remain to Live with more abundance  Yet for all these Terrors Men shall not repent or abate their Divisions their Animosities their Wars and pursuit of Blood over the Earth  About this time a terrible and bloody Battle happens between the  Swedes  and the  French  against the  Germans  and much blood shed but the Emperor's Affairs are not yet ripe for Deliverance and he must be a second time saved by the Protestant Allies or be lost for good and all The  French  now Master several Towns and large Territories and if ever  Bavaria  is Restor'd it's now  But strange Resistance is preparing against those mischiefs tho' no effect is seen this year the next will produce something more effectual  PROPHECY VII  Now the World Ripe for Action is altogether by the Ears and Blood rages in all parts of  Europe    France  has gone on with too much Success but receives a check vomits up much of his rapid Conquests and by the vigour of the Confederates is made to doubt whether he can keep his own or no yet he stoops not to make offers of Peace but swells with Pride and Revenge  Germany  seems to be a general Scene of blood and finds it next to impossible to  avoid falling into the War with the  Turks  the  Swedes  and  French  insult her in their Turn and make three large Incisions into her most tender parts  Sweden  grows great War and Diffassection together with want of Money and Strength distresses the  Pole  yet they Fight with Obstinacy against all The  Muscovite  pushes the  Turk  in his Turn and revives things on that side But this Year decides not the Fate of  Poland  The Protestant Interest gains nothing by this cruel War either in  Germany    Silesia  and  Hungaria  yet hopes and promises support them and they dispair not yet  Spain  lies still now the Sun keeps the Peace there the excessive heats give a recess from Action and gives time to our ungovernable Soldiers to kill themselves with Eating ripe Grapes Drinking new Wine and gorging themselves with the Luscious Fruits of a Luxurious Climate A new General and new Councils produce new effects there but the Army suffers much by Diseases for which we supply the Grave with new Recruits for the  Antum  Campaign  A rich plentiful Harvest in  Britain  makes the Hearts of the Country glad and  Britain  proves this Year the Granary of  Europe  a great increase and a good Market revives our Commerce but we want this Relief for we have many Losses abroad and dreadful Diseases at home affecting the Bodies or Minds of the People  PROPHECY VIII  Among the several Armies that range  Europe  none escape a most bloody Action but these in  Flanders  The  Swedes  the  Poles  the  Muscovites  the  Turks  the  Germans  make War not after the new but the old fashion and Fight as it were by mutual consent whereever they meet so that every Post now brings News of Battles and Slaughter About  August  the  Turks  and  Muscovites  Fight a terrible Battle Victory mocks both sides and both sides mock the World with their pretences to it yet the  Turks  appear sooner in the Field again and seem to feel the loss least tho they have most Men in the Roll of Slaughter  If the real Plague spreads near us it is this same Month GOD preserve our populous Towns from such a stroke the Desolation of  Dantzick  where yet they tell us a Fifth part of the People perish'd will be a Fleabite to what we must suffer but the Prophet tells you  If you escape this Year you should not flatter your selves about the next  Germany  may expect a bloody Campaign if the  Swedes  are beaten in  Poland  for if that Monarch finds his Work hard on that side he encreases his Stength for diversion on another  Denmark  seems this Year to borrow the old Character of the  Muscovites  neither fit for War or Peace for they make nothing of their Attempts any where and are beaten every where  A fruitless War upon the  Alps  where Men Fight with Mountains and Rocks are frighted with Snow and Torrents of Water struggle hard with Nature and Art and go home with little or nothing  PROPHECY IX  Spain  moves again about  September  and the Armies tho' weaknened by Fluxes and Feavers draw out Now if at all  Charles  's Affairs revive yet the  French  struggle hard and part with what they lose but by Inches Two bloody Actions weaken both sides and they take breath a while but  Charles  's gains Ground tho' with great loss of Men  France  supplies  Spain  with Men  Spain France  with Money Great Advantages arrive from the Supplies both receive from the West  Indian  Treasures and great Losses befall some People the latter end of the Summer by Sea to the Discouragement of Trade and Ruin of the Merchants  Another terrible battle in the Northern Countries the  Muscovite  grows strong by being beaten and the  Swede  weak by Victory The  Turk  makes great Havock in  Europe  and ravages great part of  Poland Hungary  begins to stir and the Emperor feels the Effects of suffering his Neighbours to grow too powerful but is too weak  to do any thing considerable having Enemies on every side  France  ends the Campaign Inglorious on every side and tho' he has not so much loss this year as he has formerly met with yet finds himself languish under the Expence his Kingdom wasting exhausted and gasping and makes Overtures of a Treaty but it comes to nothing for want of Sincerity  PROPHECY X  The Flux of Blood abates the Season about  October  enclines the Parties out of breath with a long Campaign to draw off and give over in  Dauphine  the  Germans  dare not stay to act on this side the  Alps  or the  French  on the other for fear of being cut off from their Retreat by the Snow on the Mountains so they end the Campaign with mutual Loss mutual Mischief and having mutually done nothing worth Notice  The  Swedes  push still on fighting against Elements as well as Enemies with invincible Obstinacy and resolve to Winter in the heart of  Poland  a Country wasted by War and more likely to starve the Armies in their Quarters than refresh them  Cold weather freezes up the Plague and the Desolations of that kind abate but let them not comfort themselves with the Notion of a Deliverance from it because of an Intermission  The Armies on the  Rhine  and in  Flanders  separate and may cast up their Accounts if they please they find on every side Loss and Decay of Strength much Blood much Treasure spent many Nations ravaged and ruined and the end of the Campaign looks still but like the beginning of the War yet  Spain  has no Recess but both sides prepare for a Winter War here we begin to see a new Turn and King  Charles  may bid fair for a third Visit to  Madrid  yet he keeps not all he gains and Treaty rather than Battle seems to be the end of that War at last  PROPHECY XI  The Generals now come home make their Report exalt the Merits of their own Actions emulate and decry one another and the Unfortunate bear the Load of ill Conduct according to the Custom and Usage of Mankind  The active part of the War being quite over they stand still and take breath awhile till the Winter Quarters being settled the great Ones come to lay their Heads together for the next Year  Some further Abortive Conceptions of Peace appear in the World amuse the Parties a while and then vanish again yet on the one side of  Europe  a formal Treaty begins is carried on with Cunning and Insincerity on both sides and ends in renewing the War  Spain  is still the Seat of Action we gain Ground but lose a World of Men and some Relief miscarries which Disappointment retards the Proceedings and baulks a very hopeful Prospect yet they push hard and have hopes of success a great Province revolts and changes Hands which gives a new Turn to Things but want of strength delays finishing the Work this Year and before that Defect is supply'd some Ground is lost again  PROPHECY XII  Now the World enters into Council Parliaments Assemblies of Estates Regencies Divans Grand Councils of War meeting of Generals and Mareschals take up all the Nations of  Europe  nothing of Peace is heard among them but  carrying on the War with vigour  is the Word Taxes for raising Money and Money for raising Men filling of Magazines refitting of Navies and recruiting Armies is the Language of all this part of the World  Would the great Men of  Europe  bring all their Accounts together would they cast up their Accounts and bring the Ballance of the whole to one foot of Profit and Loss  the Madness of Mankind would appear monstrous and be seen in its own Colours A Million of Lives have been lost this Year by War Pestilence and Famine Vast Treasures exhausted beyond the possibility of Account Countries wasted Cities ruined Villages burnt Frontiers plundered yet the Nations of  Europe  prepare to carry on the furious Quarrel as if nothing but the Destruction of Mankind was in their Design In  Spain  the War goes on still and Winter gives no Recess a warm Action concludes the Year in which both sides suffer loss The Confederates have the Advantage yet no great gain is made of the Matter The VVar is push'd on with great Animosity and Indefatigable Vigour of the Commanders with great loss of Blood on both sides but this Year gives no View of the End  The CONCLUSION  Thus have I  Bickerstaff  the Aged given you a View of this fatal Year that is yet to come the Sum of the Matter lies in a few Heads  France  gains at first by exerting her self with uncommon Vigour but loses again both her Glory and her Advantages before the end of the Campaign  Britain  is at a vast Expence rather gains than loses but not suitable to her Occasion any more than to her Expectation  The  Muscovite  suffers vast Losses yet gains Ground  The  Swedes  gets Victory with little profit  The  Turks  makes great Spoil with very little gain  The  Poles  have some Advantages by which they are ruined  The Empire is delivered from Peace  The  Dane  by want of Success delivered from the VVar  On every side  Europe  is afflicted plagued harassed and ravaged by the VVar and yet sees no end of her Sorrows VVhat shall befall her in the year to come shall be also foretold in its Season by me  Isaac Bickerstaff  FINIS
