 A SECOND LETTER TO THE Bishop of  BANGOR  Wherein his Lordship's NOTIONS OF  Benediction Absolution  and  ChurchCommunion  Are prov'd to be Destructive of every Institution of the  Christian Religion  To which is added a POSTSCRIPT In Answer to the OBJECTIONS that have been made against his former Letter  By  WILLIAM LAW  M A  The Second Edition  LONDON  Printed for  W INNYS  at the  Prince  's

that engag'd me in the Examination of your Lordship's Docrines in a Former Letter to your Lordship And the same Motive I hope will be thought a sufficient Apology for my presuming to give your Lordship the Trouble of a Second Letter  Amongst the Vain Contemptible Things whereof your Lordship would create an Abhorrence in the Layity are the  Trifles  and  Niceties of Authoritative Benedictions Absolutions Excommunications  Preservative  p    Again you say that  to expect the Grace of God from any Hands but his own is to affront him  P    And  that all depends upon God and our selves That Human Benedictions Human Absolutions Human Excommunications have nothing to do with the Favour of God  P  It is evident from these Maxims for your Lordship asserts them as such that whatever Institutions are observed in any Christian Society  upon this Supposition that thereby Grace is conferr'd thro'  Human Hands  or by the Ministry of the Clergy such Institutions ought to be condemn'd and are condemn'd by your Lordship as  trifling useless and affronting to God  There is an  Institution  my Lord in the  yet  Establish'd Church of  England  which we call  Confirmation  It is founded upon the express Words of Scripture Primitive Observance and the Universal Practice of all succeeding Ages in the Church The Design of this Institution is that it should be a Means of conferring Grace by the Prayer and Imposition of the  Bishop's Hands  on those who have been already Baptized But yet against all this Authority both Divine and Human and the express Order of our own Church your Lordship teaches the Layity  that all Human Benedictions are useless Niceties  and  that to expect God's Grace from any Hands but his own is to affront him  If so my Lord what shall we say in Defence of the Apostles We read  Acts  that when  Philip  the Deacon had baptiz'd the  Samaritans  the Apostles sent  Peter  and  John  to them who having pray'd and  laid their Hands on them they receiv'd the Holy Ghost who before was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus  My Lord several things are here out of Question  First  That something else even in the Apostolical Times was necessary besides Baptism  in order to qualifie Persons to become compleat Members of the Body or Partakers of the Grace of Christ They had been baptiz'd yet did not receive the Holy Ghost till the Apostles Hands were laid upon them  dly  That God's Graces are not only confer'd by means of  Human Hands  but of some particular Hands and not others  dly  That this Office was so strictly appropriated to the Apostles or Chief Governours of the Church that it could not be perform'd by Inspir'd Men tho' empower'd to work Miracles who were of an inferiour Order as  Philip  the Deacon  thly  That the Power of the Apostles for the Performance of this Ordinance was intirely owing to their superiour Degree in the Ministry and not to any extraordinary Gifts they were endow'd with For then  Philip  might have perform'd it who was not wanting in those Gifts being himself an Evangelist and Worker of Miracles Which is a Demonstration that his Incapacity arose frorn his inferior Degree in the Ministry  And now my Lord are all  Human Benedictions Niceties and Trifles  Are the Means of God's Grace in his  own Hands alone  Is it wicked and  affronting to God  to suppose the contrary How then comes  Peter  and  John  to confer the Holy Ghost by the Imposition of their Hands How comes it that they appropriate this Office to themselves Is the Dispensation of God's Grace in his  own Hands alone  And yet can it be dispens'd to us by the Ministry of some Persons and not by that of others  Were the Apostles so wicked as to distinguish themselves by a Pretence to vain Powers which God had reserv'd to himself And which your Lordship supposes from the Title of your  Preservative  that it is inconsistent with  Common Sense  to imagine that God would or could have communicated to Men  Had any of your Lordship's wellinstructed Layity liv'd in the Apostles Days with what Indignation must they have rejected this sensless Chimerical  Claim  of the Apostles They must have said Why do you  Peter  or  John  pretend to this  Blasphemous Power Whilst we believe the Gospel we cannot expect the Grace of God from any Hands but his own  You give us the  Holy Ghost  You confer the Grace of God Is it not impious to think that  He should make our Improvement  in Grace depend upon your Ministry or hang our Salvation on any  particular  Order of Clergymen We know that God is Just and Good and True  and that all  depends upon Him and our selves and that  Human Benedictions  are  Trisles  Therefore whether you  Peter  or you  Philip  or both or neither of you lay  your  Hands upon us we are neither better nor worse but just in the  same State of Grace  as we were before  This Representation has not one Syllable in it but what is founded in your Lordship's Doctrine and perfectly agreeable to it  The late most Pious and Learned Bishop  Beveridge  has these remarkable Words upon  Confirmation  How any Bishops in our Age dare neglect so considerable a Part of their Office I know not but fear they will have no good Account to give of it  when they come to stand before God's Tribunal  First Volume of Sermons    But we may justly and therefore I hope with Decency ask your Lordship how you dare perform this Part of your Office For you have condemn'd it as  Trifling  and  Wicked  as  Trifling  because it is an  Human Benediction  as  Wicked  because it supposes Grace confer'd by the  Hands of the Bishop  If therefore any baptiz'd Persons should come to your Lordship for Confirmation if you are  sincere  in what you have deliver'd your Lordship ought I humbly conceive to make them this Declaration  My Friends for the sake of  Decency  and  Order  I have taken upon me the Episcopal Character and according to Custom which has long prevaild against Common Sence am now to lay my Hands upon you But I beseech you as you have any Regard to the Truth of the Gospel or to the Honour of God not to imagine there is any Thing in this Action more than an useless empty Ceremony For if you expect to have any Spiritual Advantage from  Human Benedictions  or  to receive Grace from the Imposition of a Bishop's Hands you affront God and in effect renounce Christianity  Pray my Lord consider that Passage in the Scripture where the Apostle speaks of  Leaving the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ and going on unto Perfection not laying again the Foundation of Repentance from dead Works of Faith towards God of the Doctrine of Baptisms and of Laying on of Hands and of the Resurrection of the Dead and of eternal Judgment  Heb    My Lord here it is undeniably plain that this Laying on of Hands which is with us called  Confirmation  is so fundamental a Part of Christ's Religion that it is called one of the First Principles of the Doctrine of Christ and is placed amongst such primary Truths as the Resurrection of the Dead and of Eternal Judgment  St  Cyprian  speaking of this Apostolical Imposition of Hands says  The same is now practis'd with us they who have been baptiz'd in the Church are brought to the Presidents of the Church that by our Prayer and Imposition of Hands they may receive the Holy Ghost and be consummated with the Lord's Seal  And must we yet believe that all  Human Benedictions  are Dreams and the Imposition of Human Hands trifling and useless and that to expect God's Graces from them is to affront  him Tho' the Scriptures expressly teach us that God confers his Grace by means of certain  particular Human Hands  and not of others tho' they tell us this  Human Benediction  this Laying on of Hands is one of the first Principles of the Religion of Christ and as much a Foundation Doctrine as the Resurrection of the Dead and Eternal Judgment and tho' every Age since that of the Apostles has strictly observ'd it as such and the Authority of our own Church still requires the Observance of it  I come now my Lord to another Sacred and Divine Institution of Christ's Church which stands expos'd and condemn'd by your Lordship's Doctrine and that is the  Ordination  of the Christian Clergy where by means of an Human Benediction and the Imposition of the Bishop's Hands the Holy Ghost is supposed to be confer'd on Persons towards consecrating them for the Work of the Ministry  We find it constantly taught by the Scriptures that all Ecclesiastical Authority and the Graces whereby the Clergy are qualified and enabl'd to exercise their Functions to the Benefit of the Church are the Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit Thus the Apostle exhorts the Elders  to take heed unto the Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made them Overseers  Eph But how my Lord had the Holy Ghost made them Overseers but by the Laying on of the Apostles Hands They were not immediately call'd by the Holy Ghost but being consecrated by  such  Human Hands  as had been authorized to that purpose they were as truly call'd by him and sanctified with Grace for that Employment as if they had receiv'd an immediate or miraculous Commission So again St  Paul  puts  Timothy  in mind  to stir up the Gift of God that was in him by laying on of his Hands  Tim  And now my Lord if  Human Benedictions  be such idle  Dreams  arid  Trifles  if it be  affronting to God  to expect his Graces from them or through  Human Hands  do we not plainly want new Scriptures Must we not give up the Apostles as Furious HighChurch Prelates who aspir'd to presumptuous Claims and talk'd of conferring the Graces of God by their own Hands Was not this Doctrine as strange and unaccountable then as at present Was it not as inconsistent with the Attributes and Sovereignty of God at that time to have his Graces pass through other Hands than his own as in any succeeding Age Nay my Lord where shall we find any Fathers or Councils in the Primitive Church but who own'd and asserted these Powers They that were so ready to part with their Lives rather than do the least Dishonour to God or the Chiristian Name yet were all guilty of  this horrid Blasphemy  in imagining that they were to bless in God's Name and that by the Benediction and Laying on of the Bishop's Hands the Graces of the Holy Ghost could be confer'd on any Persons  Agreeable to the Sence of Scripture and Antiquity our Church uses this Form of Ordination  The Bishop laying his Hands on the Person's Head saith Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of a Priest in the Church of God committed unto thee by the Imposition of our Hands  From this Form it is plain  First  that our Church holds that the Reception of the Holy Ghost is necessary to constitute a Person a Christian Priest  dly  That the Holy Ghost is confer'd through  Human Hands    dly  That it is by the Hands of a Bishop that the Holy Ghost is confer'd  If therefore your Lordship is right in your Doctrine the Church of  England  is evidently most corrupt For if it be dishonourable and affronting to God to expect his Grace from any Human Hands it must of necessity be dishonourable and affronting to him for a Bishop to pretend to confer it by his Hands And can that Church be any ways defended that has establish'd such an Iniquity by Law and made the Form of it so necessary How can your Lordship answer it to your Layity for taking the Character or Power of a Bishop from such a Form of Words You tell them it is affronting to God to expect his Grace from  Human Hands  yet to qualifie your self for a Bishoprick you let Human Hands be laid on you after a manner which directly supposes you thereby receive the Holy Ghost Is it wicked in them to expect it from  Human Hands  And is it less so in  your Lordship to pretend to receive it from Human Hands He that believes it is affronting to  God  to expect his Grace from Human Hands must likewise believe that our Form of Ordination which promises the Holy Ghost by the  Bishop  's  Hands  must be also affronting to God Certainly he cannot be said to be very jealous of the Honour of God who will submit himself to be made a Bishop by a Form of Words derogatory upon his own Principles to God's Honour  Suppose your Lordship was to have been consecrated to the Office of a Bishop by these Words  Take thou Power to sustain all things in Being given thee by my Hands  I suppose your Lordship would think it intirely Unlawful to submit to the Form of such an Ordination But  my Lord receive thou the Holy Ghost  c is as impious a Form according to your Lordship's Doctrine and equally injurious to the Eternal Power and Godhead as the other For if the Grace of God can only be had from  his own  Hands would it not be as innocent in the Bishop to say  Receive then Power to sustain all things in Being  as to say  Receive the Holy Ghost by the Imposition of my Hands  And would not a Compliance with either Form be equally unlawful According to your Doctrine in each of them God's Prerogative is equally invaded and therefore the Guilt must be the same  It may also well be wonder'd how your Lordship can accept of a Character which is or ought to be chiefly distinguish'd by the Exercise of that Power which you disclaim as in the Offices of  Confirmation  and  Ordination  For my Lord where can be the Sincerity of saying  Receive the Holy Ghost by the Imposition of our Hands  when you declare it affronting to God to expect it from any Hands but his own Suppose your Lordship had been preaching to the Layity against owning any Authority in the Virgin  Mary  and yet should acquiesce in the Conditions of being made a Bishop in her Name and by recognizing her Power Could such a Submission be consistent with Sincerity Here you forbid the Layity to expect God's Grace from any Hands but his yet not only accept of an Office upon Supposition of the contrary Doctrine but oblige your self according to the Sence of the Church wherein you are ordain'd a Bishop to act frequently in direct Opposition to your own Principles  So that I think it is undeniably plain that you have at once my Lord by these Doctrines condemn'd the Scriptures the Apostles their martyr'd Successors the Church of  England  and your own Conduct and have hereby given us some reason tho' I wish there were no Occasion to mention it to suspect whether you who allow of no other Church but what is founded in Sincerity are your self really a Member of any Church  I shall now proceed to say something upon the Consecration of the Lord's Supper which is as much expos'd as a  Trifle  by your Lordship's Doctrine as the other Institutions St  Paul  says  The Cup of Blessing which we bless is it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ  My Lord is not this Cup still to be bless'd Must there not therefore be such a thing as an  Human Benediction  And are Human Benedictions to be all despis'd though by them the Bread and Wine become Means of Grace and are made the Spiritual Nourishment of our Souls Can any one bless this Cup If not then there is a Difference between Human Benedictions Some are authorized by God and their Blessing is effectual whilst others only are vain and presumptuous If the Prayer over the Elements and the Consecration be only a Trifle and a Dream and it be offensive to God to expect they are converted into Means of Grace by an Human Benediction why then did St  Paul  pretend to bless them Why did he make it the Privilege of the Church Or why do we keep up the same Solemnity But if it be to be bless'd only by God's Ministers then how can your Lordship answer it to God for ridiculing and abusing Human Benedictions and telling the World that a particular Order of the Clergy are not of any necessity nor can be of any Advantage to them For if the Sacrament can only be bless'd by God's Ministers then such Ministers are as necessary as the Sacraments themselves  St  Paul  says the Cup must be bless'd If you say any one may bless it then though you contemn the Benedictions of the Clergy you allow of them by every body else If every body cannot bless it then you must confess that the Benedictions of some Persons are effectual where others are not  My Lord the great Sin against the Holy Ghost was the Denial of his Operation in the Ministry of our Saviour And how near does your Lordship come to it in denying the Operation of that same Spirit in the Ministers whom Christ hath sent They are employed in the same Work that he was He left his Authority with them and promis'd that the Holy Spirit should remain with them to the End of the World that whatsoever they should bind on Earth should be bound in Heaven and whatsoever they should loose on Earth should be loosed in Heaven that whosoever despises them despises Him and Him that sent him And yet your Lordship tells us we need not to trouble our Heads about any particular Sort of Clergy that all is to be transacted betwixt God and our selves that Human Benedictions are infignisicant Trifles  But pray what Proof has your Lordship for all this Have you any Scripture for it Has God any where declar'd that no Men on Earth have any Authority to bless in his Name Has he any where said that it is a wicked presumptuous  Thing for any one to pretend to it Has he any where cold us that it is inconsistent with his Honour to bestow his Graces by  Human Hands  Has he any where told us that he has no Ministers no Embassadors on Earth but that all his Gifts and Graces are to be receiv'd immediately from his own Hands Have you any Antiquity Fathers or Councils on your side No The whole Tenour of Scripture the whole Current of Tradition is against you Your Novel Doctrine has only this to recommend it to the Libertines of the Age who universally give into it that it never was the Opinion of any Church or Churchman It is your Lordship's proper Assertion  That we offend God in expecting his Graces from any Hands but his own  Now it's strange that God should be offended with his own Methods or that your Lordship should find us out a Way of pleasing him more suitable to his Nature and Attributes than what he has taught us in the Scriptures I call them his own Methods For what else is the whole  Jewish  Dispensation but a Method of God's Providence where his Blessings and Judgments were dispens'd by  Human Hands  What is the Christian Religion but a Method of Salvation where the chief Means of Grace are offer'd and dispens'd by Human Hands Let me here recommend to your Lordship the excellent Words of a very Learned and Judicious Prelate on this Occasion  This will have no Weight with any Reasonable Man against the Censures of the Church or any other Ordinance of the Gospel that they make the Intervention of other Men necessary to our Salvation since it has always been God's ordinary Method to dispense his Blessings and Judgments by the Hands of Men  Dr  Potter  's ChurchGovernment  p      Your Lordship exclaims against your Adversaries as such Romantick strange sort of Men for talking of Benedictions and Absolutions and of the Necessity of receiving God's Ordinances from proper Hands Yet my Lord here is an Excellent Bishop against whose  Learnings Judgment  and  Protestantism  there can be no Objection who says if a Person have but the  Use of his Reason  he will have nothing to object to any Ordinances of the Gospel which make the Intervention of other Men necessary towards the Conveyance of them since that has always been God's ordinary Method The Bishop does not say it is necessary a Man should be a  Great Divine  to acknowledge it so he be but a  Reasonable Man  he will allow it Yet your Lordship is so far from being this  Reasonable Man  that you think your Adversaries void both of Reason and common Sense for teaching it You expressly exclude  All  Persons from having any thing to do with our Salvation and say it  wholly  depends upon God and our selves  You tell us that  Authoritative Benediction is another of the Terms of Art used by your Protestant Adversaries in which they claim a Right in one Regular Succession of Blessing the People  Page  An ingenious Author my Lord in the Opinion of many if not of most of your Friends calls the  Consecration  of the Elements  Conjuration  Rights of the Christian Church  your Lordship calls the  Sacerdotal Benediction  a  Term of Art  too plain an Intimation tho' in more remote and somewhat softer Terms that in the Sence of a  Certain Father  of the Church her Clergy are little better than so many Jugglers  Your Lordship says  If they only meant hereby to declare upon what Terms God will give his Blessings  to Christians  or to express their own hearty Wishes for them this might be understood  So it might my Lord very easily and I suppose every body understands that they may do this whether they be Clergy or Layity Men or Women For I presume any one may declare what he takes to be the Terms of the Gospel and wish that others may faithfully observe them But I humbly presume my Lord that the Good Bishop abovemention'd meant something more than this when he spake of  Ordinances which make the Intervention of other Men  necessary  to our Salvation and of God's dispensing his Blessings  in virtue of them through their Hands  There is a superstitious Custom in your Lordship's Account it must be so yet remaining in most Places of sending for a Clergyman to minister to sick Persons in imminent Danger of Death Even those who have abus'd the Clergy all their Lives long are glad to beg their Assistance when they apprehend themselves upon the Confines of another World There is no reason my Lord to dislike this  Practice  but as it supposes a Difference between the  Sacerdotal Prayers  and  Benedictions  and those of a Nurse  We read my Lord that God would not heal  Abimelech  tho' he knew the Integrity of his Heart till  Abraham  had prayed for him  He is a Prophet  said God  he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live  Gen  Pray my Lord was not God Just and Good and True in the Days of  Abraham  as He is now Yet you see  Abimelech's Integrity  was not available it self He was to be pardon'd by the Prayer of  Abraham  and his Prayer was effectual and so represented because it was the Prayer of a  Prophet  Suppose my Lord that  Abimelech  had said with your Lordship  That it is affronting to God that we should expect his Graces from any Hands  but  his own that all is to be transacted between God and our selves  and so had rejected the Prayer of  Abraham  as a mere Essay of  ProphetCraft  He had then acted with as much Prudence and Piety as  your Lordship's Layity would do if you could persuade them to despise  Benedictions  and  Absolutions  to regard no  particular sort of Clergy  but intirely depend upon God and themselves without any other Assistance whatever  We read also that  Joshua was full of the Spirit of Wisdom for Moses had laid his Hands upon him  Deut Was it not as absurd my Lord in the Days of  Joshua  for  Human Hands  to  bless  as it is now Did there not then lie the same Objection against  Moses  that there does now against the Christian Clergy Had  Moses  any more  Natural Power  to give the Spirit of Wisdom  c  by his Hands than the Clergy have to confer Grace by theirs They are both equally weak and insufficient for these Purposes of themselves and equally powerful when it pleases God to make them so  Again when  Eliphaz  and his Friends had displeased God they were not to be reconciled to God by their own Repentance or transact that Matter only between God and themselves but they were refer'd to apply to  Job My Servant Job shall pray for you for him will I accept  Job Might not  Eliphaz  here have said shall I so far affront God as to think I can't be bless'd without the Prayers of  Job  Shall I be so weak or senseless as to imagine my own Supplications and Repentance will not save me or that I need apply to any one but God alone to quailfie me for the Reception of his Grace  Again  The Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto Aaron and his Sons saying on this wise shall ye bless the Children of Israel saying unto them  The Lord bless and keep thee  c and I will bless them  Numb    Again  The Priests of the Sous of Levi shall come near for them hath the Lord thy God chosen to minister unto him and to bless in the Name of the Lord  Deut    Now my Lord this is what we mean by the Authoritative Administrations of the Christian Clergy whether they be by way of Benediction or of any other kind We take them to be Persons whom God has chosen to minister unto him and to bless in his Name We imagine that our Saviour was a greater  Priest and Mediator  than  Aaron  or any of God's former Ministers We are assur'd that Christ sent his Apostles as his Father had sent him and that therefore they were his true Successors And since they did commission others to succeed them in their Office by the Imposition of Hands as  Moses  commission'd  Joshua  to succeed him the Clergy who have succeeded the Apostles have as Divine a Call and Commission to their Work as those who were call'd by our Saviour and are as truly his Successors as the Apostles themselves were  From the Places of Scripture above mentioned it is evident and indeed from the whole Tenour of Sacred Writ that it may consist with the Goodness and Justice of God to depute Men to act in his Name and be ministerial towards the Salvation of others and to lay a Necessity upon his Creatures of qualifying themselves for his Favour and receiving his Graces by the Hands and Intervention of mere Men  But my Lord if there be now any Set of Men upon Earth that are more peculiarly God's Ministers than others and thro whose Administrations Prayers and Benedictions God will accept of returning Sinners and receive them to Grace you have done all you can to prejudice People against them You have taught the Layity that all is to be transacted between God and themselves and that they need not value any particular sort of Clergy in the World  I leave it to the Great Judge and Searcher of Hearts to judge from what Principles or upon what Motives your Lordship has been induc'd to teach tesethings But must declare that for my own part if I had the greatest Hatred to Christianity I should think it could not be more express'd than by teaching what your Lordship has publickly taught If I could rejoice in the Misery and Ruin of Sinners I should think it sufficient Matter of Triumph to drive them from the Ministers of God and to put them upon inventing new Schemes of saving  themselves instead of submitting to the ordinary Methods of Salvation appointed by God  It will not follow from any thing I have said that the Layity have lost their Christian Liberty or that no body can be sav'd but whom the Clergy please to save that they have the arbitrary Disposal of Happiness to Mankind Was  Abimelech  's Happiness in the Disposition of  Abraham  because he was to be receiv'd by means of  Abraham  's Intercession Or could  Job  damn  Eliphaz  because he was to mediate for him and procure his Reconciliation to God  Neither my Lord do the  Christian Clergy  pretend to this despotick Empire over their Flocks They don't assume to themselves a Power to damn the Innocent or to save the Guilty But they assert a sober and just Right to reconcile Men to God and to act in his Name in restoring them to his Favour They receiv'd their Commission from those whom Christ sent with full Authority to send others and with a Promise that he would be with them to the End of the World From this they conclude that they have his Authority and that in consequence of it their Administrations are necessary and effectual to the Salvation of Mankind and that none can despise Them but who despise Him that sent them and are as surely out of the Covenant of Grace when they leave such his Pastors as when they openly despise or omit to receive his Sacraments  And what is there in this Doctrine my Lord to terrifie the  Consciences  of the  Layity  What is there here to bring the prophane Scandal of  Priestcraft  upon the  Clergy  Could it be any ground of  Abimelech  's hating  Abraham  because that  Abraham  was to reconcile him to God Could  Eliphaz  justly have any Prejudice against  Job  because God would hear  Job  's Intercession for him Why then my Lord must the Christian Priesthood be so horrid and hateful an Institution because the Design of it is to restore Men to the Grace and Favour of God Why must we be abus'd and insulted for being sent upon the Errand of Salvation and made Ministers of eternal Happiness to our Brethren There is a Woe due to us if we preach not the Gospel or neglect those ministerial Offices that Christ has entrusted to us We are to watch for their Souls as those who are to give an Account Why then must we be treated as arrogant Priests or  Popishly  affected for pretending to have any thing to do in the Discharge of our  Ministry  with the Salvation of Men Why must we be reproach'd with  Blasphemous Claims  and  Absurd Senseless Powers▪  for assuming to bless in God's Name or thinking our Administrations more effectual than the Office of a common  Layman  But farther to what purpose does your Lordship except against these Powers in the  Clergy  from their  common Frailties  and  Infirmities  with the rest of Mankind Were not  Abraham  and  Job  and the  Jewish  Priests Men of like Passions with us Did not our Saviour command the  Jews  to apply to their Priests notwithstanding their Personal Faults because they sat in  Moses  's Chair Did not the Apostles assure their Followers that they were Men of like Passions with them But did they therefore disclaim their Mission or Apostolical Authority Did they teach that their Natural Infirmities made them less the Ministers of God or less necessary to the Salvation of Men Their Personal Defects did not make them depart from the Claim of those Powers they were invested with or desert their Ministry But indeed gave St  Paul  Occasion to say  We have this Treasure in Earthen Vessels    ie  this Authority committed to mere Men  that the Excellency of it may be of God and not of Men  The  Apostle  happens to differ very much from your Lordship He says such weak Instruments were made use of that the Glory might redound to God Your Lordship says to suppose such Instruments to be of any Benefit to us is to lessen the Sovereignty of God and in consequence his Glory  Your Lordship imagines you have sufficiently destroy'd the  Sacerdotal Powers  by shewing that the  Clergy  are only Men and subject to the common Frailties of Mankind My Lord we own the Charge and don't claim any  Sacerdotal Powers  from our Personal Abilities or to acquire any Glory to our selves But weak as we are we are God's Ministers and if we are either afraid or asham'd of our Duty we must perish  in the Guilt But is a  Prophet  therefore proud because he insists upon the Authority of his Mission Can't a Mortal be God's Messenger and employ'd in his Affairs but he must be insolent and assuming for having the Resolution to own it If we are to be reprov'd for pretending to be God's Ministers because we are but Men the Reproach will fall upon Providence since it has pleased God chiefly to transact his Affairs with Mankind by the Ministry of their Brethren  Your Lordship has not One Word from Scripture against these  Sacerdotal Powers  no Proof that Christ has not sent Men to be effectual Administrators of his Graces You only assert that there can be no such Ministers because they are mere Men  Now my Lord I must beg leave to say that if the Natural Weakness of Men makes them incapable of being the Instruments of conveying Grace to their Brethren if the Clergy can't be of any Use or Necessity to their Flocks for this Reason then it undeniably follows that there can be no  positive Institutions  in the Christian Religion that can procure any Spiritual Advantages to the Members of it then the Sacraments can be no longer any Means of Grace For I hope no one thinks that Bread and Wine have any natural Force or Efficacy to convey Grace to the Soul The Water in Baptism has the common Qualities of Water and is destitute of any intrinsick Power to cleanse the Soul or  purifie from Sin But your Lordship will not say because it has only the common Name of Water that therefore it cannot be a Means of Grace Why then may not the Clergy tho' they have the common Nature of Men be constituted by God to convey his Graces and to be ministerial to the Salvation of their Brethren Can God consecrate inanimate Things to Spiritual Purposes and make them the Means of Eternal Happiness And is Man the only Creature that he can't make subservient to his Designs The only  Being  who is too Weak for an Omnipotent God to render effectual towards attaining the Ends of his Grace  Is it just and reasonable to reject and despise the  Ministry  and  Benedictions  of Men because they are Men like our selves And is it not as reasonable to despise the sprinkling of Water a Creature below us a senseless and inanimate Creature  Your Lordship therefore must either find us some other Reason for rejecting the Necessity of  Human Administrations  than because they are  Human  or else give up the Sacraments and  all  Positive Institutions along with them  Surely your Lordship must have a mighty Opinion of  Naaman  the  Syrian  who when the Prophet bid him go wash in  Jordan  seven times to the end he might be clean from his Leprosie Very  wisely  remonstrated  Are not  Abana  and  PharlPar  Rivers of  Damascus  better than all the Waters of  Israel  This my Lord discover'd  Naaman  's great  Liberty  of Mind and 'tis much this has not been produc'd before as an Argument of his being a  FreeThinker  He took the Water of  Jordan  to be  only Water  as your Lordship justly observes a Clergyman to be  only  a Man And if you had been with him you could have inform'd him that the washing  seven times  was a mere  Nicety  and  Trifle  of the Prophet and that since it is God alone who can work  miraculous Cures  we ought not to think that they depend upon any external Means or any stated Number of repeating them  This my Lord is the true Scope and Spirit of your Argument If the  Syrian  was right in despising the Water of  Jordan  because it was only  your Lordship may be right in despising any particular Order of Clergy because they are but Men Your Lordship is certainly as right or as wrong as he was  And now my Lord let the common Sence of Mankind here judge whether if the Clergy are to be esteem'd as having no Authority because they are mere Men it does not plainly follow that every thing else every Institution that has not some  natural  Force and Power to produce the Effects designed by it is not also to be rejected as equally Trifling and Ineffectual  The Sum of the matter is this It appears from many express Facts and indeed from the whole Series of God's Providence that it is not only consistent with his Attributes but also agreeable to his ordinary Methods of dealing with Mankind that he should substitute Men to act in his Name and be  Authoritatively  employ'd in conferring his Grace and Favours upon Mankind It appears that your Lordship's Argument against the Authoritative Administrations of the Christian Clergy does not only contradict those Facts and condemn the ordinary Method of God's Dispensations but likewise proves the Sacraments and every positive Institution of Christianity to be ineffectual and as mere  Dreams  and  Trifles  as the several  Offices and Orders  of the Clergy  This I hope will be esteem'd a sufficient Confutation of your Lordship's Doctrine by all who have any true Regard or Zeal for the Christian Religion and only expect to be sav'd by the Methods of Divine Grace propos'd in the Gospel  I shall now in a Word or two set forth the Sacredness of the Ecclesiastical Character as it is founded in the New Testament with a particular regard to the Power of conferring Grace and the Efficacy of Human Benedictions  It appears therein that all Sacerdotal Power as deriv'd from the Holy Ghost Our Saviour himself took not the  Minstry  upon him till he had this Consecration And during the time of his Ministry he was under the Guidance and Direction of the Holy Ghost Thro' the Holy Spirit he gave Commandment to the Apostles whom he had chosen When he ordain'd them to the Work of the Ministry it was with these Words  Receive the Holy Ghost  Those whom the Apostles ordain'd to the same Function it was by the same Authority They laid their Hands upon the Elders exhorting them to take care of she Flock of Christ over which the Holy Ghost had made them Overseers  Hereby they plainly declar'd that however this Office was to descend from Man to Man through  Human Hands  that it was the Holy Ghost which consecrated them to that Employment and gave them Authority to execute it  From this it is also manifest that the Priesthood is a Grace of the Holy Ghost that it is not a Function founded in the Natural or Civil Rights of Mankind but is deriv'd from the Special Authority of the Holy Ghost and is as truly a positive Institution as the Sacraments So that they who have no Authority to alter the Old Sacraments and substitute New ones have no Power to alter the Old Order of the Clergy or introduce any other Order of them  For why can we not change the Sacraments Is it not because they are only Sacraments and operate as they are instituted by the Holy Ghost Because they are useless ineffectual Rites without this Authority And does not the same Reason hold as well for the Order of the Clergy Does not the same Scripture tell us they are equally instituted by the Holy Ghost and oblige only by virtue of his Authority How absurd is it therefore to pretend to abolish or depart from the Settled Order of the Clergy to make New Orders and think any God's Ministers unless we had his Authority and could make New Sacraments or a New Religion  My Lord how comes it that we cannot alter the Scriptures Is it not because they are Divinely inspir'd and dictated by the Holy Ghost And since it is express Scripture that the  Priesthood  is instituted and authoriz'd by the same Holy Spirit why is not the Holy Ghost as much to be regarded in one Institution as in another Why may we not as well make a Gospel and say it was writ by the Holy Ghost as make a New Order of Clergy and call them His or esteem them as having any relation to him  From this it likewise appears that there is an absolute Necessity of a strict Succession of Authoriz'd Ordainers from the Apostolical Times in order to constitute a  Christian Priest  For since a Commission from the Holy Ghost is necessary for the Exercise of this Office no one now can  receive it but from those who have deriv'd their Authority in a true Succession from the Apostles We could not my Lord call our present Bibles the  Word of God  unless we knew the Copies from which they are taken were taken from other true ones till we come to the Originals themselves No more could we call any True Ministers or Authoriz'd by the Holy Ghost who have not receiv'd their Commission by an uninterrupted Succession of Lawful Ordainers  What an Excellent Divine would he be who should tell the World it was not necessary that the several Copies and Manuscripts through which the Scriptures have been transmitted thro' different Ages and Languages should be all true ones and none of them forg'd that  this was a thing subject to so great Uncertainty that God could not hang our Salvation on such Niceties  Suppose for Proof of this he should appeal to the Scriptures and ask where any Mention is made of ascertaining the Truth of all the Copies Would not this be a Way of Arguing very Theological The Application is very easie  Your Lordship has not one Word to prove the uninterrupted Succession of the Clergy a  Triste  or  Dream  but that it is subject to so great Uncertainty and is never mention'd in the Scriptures And to the Uncertainty of it it is equally as uncertain as whether the Scriptures be  genuine  There is just the same sufficient Historical Evidence for the Certainty of one as the other As to its not being mention'd in the Scripture  the Doctrine upon which it is founded plainly made it unnecessary to mention it Is it needful for the Scriptures to tell us that if we take our Bible from any false Copy that it is not the Word of God Why then need they tell us that if we are Ordain'd by Usurping False Pretenders to Ordination not deriving their Authority to that end from the Apostles that we are no Priests Does not the thing it self speak as plain in one Case as in the other The Scriptures are only of use to us as they are the Word of God We cannot have this Word of God which was written so many Years ago unless we receive it from Authentick Copies and Manuscripts  The Clergy have their Commission from the Holy Ghost The Power of conferring this Commission of the Holy Ghost was left with the Apostles Therefore the present Clergy cannot have the same Commission or Call but from an Order of Men who have successively convey'd his Power from the Apostles to the present time So that my Lord I shall beg leave to lay it down as a plain undeniable Christian Truth that the Order of the Clergy is an Order of as necessary Obligation as the Sacraments and as unalterable as the Holy Scriptures the same Holy Ghost being as truly the Author and Founder of the Priesthood as the Institutor of the Sacraments or the Inspirer of those Divine Oracles And when your Lordship shall offer any fresh Arguments to prove that no particular sort of Clergy is necessary that the Benedictions and Administrations of the present Clergy  of our most Excellent Church are Trifling Niceties if I cannot shew that the same Arguments will conclude against the Authority of the Sacraments and the Scriptures I faithfully promise your Lordship to become a Convert to your Doctrine  What your Lordship charges upon your Adversaries as an Absurd Doctrine in pretending the Necessity of one regular successive and particular Order of the Clergy is a True Christian Doctrine and as certain from Scripture as that we are to keep to the Institution of particular Sacraments or not to alter those particular Scriptures which now compose the Canon of the Old and New Testament  By Authoritative Benediction we do not mean any Natural or Intrinsick Authority of our own But a Commission from God to be Effectual Administrators of his Ordnances and to bless in his Name Thus a Person who is sent from God to foretel things of which he had before no Knowledge or Notion or to denounce Judgments which he has no Natural Power to execute may be truly said to be an  Authoritative Prophet  because he has the Authority of God for what he does Thus when the Bishop is said to confer Grace in Confirmation this is properly an  Authoritative Benediction  because he is then as truly doing what God has commission'd him to do as when a Prophet declares upon what Errand he is sent  'Tis in this Sence my Lord that the People are said to be  Authoritatively  bless'd by the Regular Clergy because they are  God  's  Clergy  and act by his Commission bacause by their Hands the People receive the Graces and Benefits of God's Ordinances which they have no more Reason to expect from other Ministers of their own Election or if the Word may be us'd in an abusive Sence of their own  Consecration  than to receive Grace from Sacraments of their own Appointment The Scriptures teach us that the Holy Ghost has instituted an Order of Clergy We say a Priesthood so authoriz'd can no more be chang'd by us than we can change the Scriptures or make New Sacraments because they are all founded on the same Authority without any Power of a Dispensation delegated to us in one Case more than in another If therefore we have a mind to continue in the Covenant of Christ and receive the Grace and Benefit of his Ordinances we must receive them through such Hands as he has authoriz'd for that Purpose to the end we may be qualify'd to partake the Blessings of them For as a  True  Priest cannot benefit us by administring a  False  Sacrament so a  True  Sacrament is nothing when it is administred by a  False Uncommission'd Minister  Besides this Benediction which attends the Ordinances of God when they are thus perform'd by authoriz'd Hands there is a Benediction of Prayer which we may justly think very effectual when pronounc'd or dispens'd by the same Hands  Thus when the Bishop or Priest intercedes for the Congregation or pronounces the Apostolical Benediction upon them we do not consider this barely as an Act of Charity and Humanity of one Christian praying for another but as the Work of a Person who is commission'd by God▪ to  bless in his Name  and be effectually ministerial in the Conveyance of his Graces or as the Prayer of one who is left with us in Christ's stead to carry on his great Design of saving us and whose Benedictions are ever ratify'd in Heaven but when we render our selves in one respect or other incapable of them  Now my Lord they are these  Sacerdotal Prayers  these Authoriz'd Sacraments these Commission'd Pastors whom the Holy Ghost has made Overseers of the Flock of Christ that your Lordship encourages the Layity to despise You bid them  contemn the vain Words of Validity or Invalidity of God's Ordinances  to  heed no particular sort of Clergy or the pretended Necessity of their Administrations  Your Lordship sets up in this Controversie for an Advocate for the Layity against the  Arrogant Pretences  and  False Claims  of the Clergy My Lord we are no more contending for our selves in this Doctrine than when we insist upon any Article in the Creed Neither is it any more our particular Cause when we assert our Mission than when we assert the Necessity of the Sacraments  Who is to receive the Benefit of that Commission which we assert but They Who is to suffer if we pretend a False one but Our selves Sad Injury indeed offer'd to the Layity That we should affect to be thought Ministers of God for their sakes If we really are so they are to receive the Benefit if not we are to bear the Punishment  But your Lordship comes too late in this glorious Undertaking to receive the Reputation of it The Work has been already in the Opinion of most People better done to your Lordship's hands The Famous Author of the  Rights of the Christian Church  has carry'd this  Christian Liberty  to as great Heights as your Lordship And tho' you have not one Notion I can recollect that has given Offence▪ to the World but what seems taken from that pernicious Book yet your Lordship is not so just as ever once to cite or mention the Author who if your Lordship's Doctrine be true deserves to have a Statue erected to his Honour and receive every Mark of Esteem which is due to the greatest Reformer of Religion  Did not mine own Eyes allure me that he has cast no Contempt upon the Church no Reproach upon the Evangelical Institutions or the Sacred Function but what has been seconded by your Lnrdship I would never have plac'd your Lordship in the same View with  so scandalous a Declaimer against the Ordinannances of Christ Whether I am right or not in this Charge I freely leave to the Judgment of those to determine who are acquainted with both your Works Yet this Author my Lord has been treated by the greatest and best Part of the Nation as a Freethinking Infidel But for what my Lord Not that he has declar'd against the Scriptures not that he has rejected Revelation we are not blessed be God still so far corrupted with the Principles of Infidelity but because he has reproach'd every particular Church as such and deny'd all Obligation to Communion because he has expos'd Benedictions Absolutions and Excommunications deny'd the Divine Right of the Clergy and ridicul'd the pretended Sacredness and Necessity of their Administrations as mere Niceties and Trifles tho' commonly in more distant I was going to say more decent Ways In a word because he made all Churches all Priests all Sacraments however administred equally valid and deny'd any particular Method necessary to Salvation Yet after all this prophane Declamation he allows my Lord that  Religious Offices may be appropriated to particular Men call'd  Clergy  for Order sake only and not on the Account of any peculiar Spiritual Advantages Powers or Privileges which those who art set apart for them have from Heaven  Page    Agreeable to this your Lordship owns that you are not against the  Order  or  Decency  or  Subordination belonging to Christian Societies  Answer to Dr  Snape  p    But pray my Lord do you mean any more by this than the abovemention'd Author Is it for any thing but the sake of a little external  Order  or  Conveniency  Is there any Christian Law that obliges to observe this kind of Order Is there any real essential Difference between Persons rank'd into this Order Is it a Sin for any body especially the Civil Magistrate to leave this Order and make what other Orders he prefers to it This your Lordship cannot resolve in the Affirmative for then you must allow that some Communions are safer than others and that some Clergy have more Authority than others  Will your Lordship say that no  particular  Order can be necessary yet some Order necessary which may be different in different Communions This cannot hold good upon your Lordship's Principles For since Christ has left no Law about any Order no Members of any particular Communion need submit to that Order since it is confess'd by your Lordship That in Religion no Laws but those of Christ are of any Obligation So that tho' you don't disclaim all external Order and Decency your  self yet you have taught other People to do it if they please and as much as they please  Suppose my Lord some Layman upon a Pretence of your Lordship's Absence or any other should go into the Dlocess of  Bangor  and there pretend to Ordain Clergymen could your Lordship quote one Text of Scripture against him Could you alledge any Law of Christ or his Apostles that he had broken Could you prove him guilty of any Sin No my Lord you would not do that because this would be acknowledging such a thing as a  Sinful Ordination  and if there be Sinful Ordinations then there mus be some  Law  concerning Ordinations For  Sin is the Transgression of the Law  And if there be a Law concerning Ordinations then we must keep to the Clergy  lawfully  Ordain'd and must confess after all your Lordship has said or can say that still some Communions are safer than others  If you should reprove such a one as an  Englishman  for acting in Opposition to the  English  Laws of  Decency and Order  he would answer That he has nothing to do with such  Trifles  That Christ was sole Lawgiver in his Kingdom That he was content to have his Kingdom as  Orderly  and  Decent  as Christ had left it and since he had instituted no Laws in that matter it was presuming for others to take upon them to add any thing by way of  Order  or  Decency  by Laws of their own That as he had as much Authority from  Christ to Ordain Clergy as your Lordship he would not depart from his Christian Liberty  If he should remonstrate to your Lordship in these or Words to the like effect he would only reduce your Lordship's own Doctrine to Practice This my Lord is pare of that Confusion the Learned Dr  Snape  has charged you with being the Author of in the Church of God And all Persons my Lord whom you have taught not to regard any particular sort of Clergy must know if they have the common Sense to which you appeal that then no Clergy are at all necessary and that it's as lawful for any Man to be his own Priest as to sollicit his own Cause For to say that no particular sort of Clergy are necessary and yet that in general the Clergy are necessary is the same as to say that Truth is necessary to be believ'd yet the Belief of no particular Truth is necessary  The next thing to be consider'd my Lord is your Doctrine concerning Absolutions You begin thus  The same you will find a sufficient Reply to their presumptuous Claim to an Authoritative Absolution An infallible Absolution cannot belong to fallible Men But no Absolution can be Authoritative which is not Infallible Therefore no Authoritative Absolution can belong to any Man living  Preservative  p    I must observe here your Lordship does not reject this  Absolution  because the Claim of it is not founded in Scripture but by an Argument drawn from the nature of the Thing Because you imagine such Absolution requires Infallibility for the Execution of it therefore it cannot belong to Men Should this be true it would prove that if our Saviour had really so intended he could not have given this Power to his Ministers But my Lord who can see any Repugnancy in the Reason of the Thing it self Is it not as easie to conceive that our Lord should confer his Grace of Pardon by the Hands of his Ministers as by Means of the Sacraments And may not such Absolution be justly called  Authoritative  the Power of which is granted and executed by his Authority  Is it impossible for Men to have this Authority from God because they may mistake in the Exercise of it This Argument proves too much and makes as short work with every Institution of Christianity as with this Power of Absolution  For if it is impossible that Men should have Authority from God to Absolve in his Name because they are not Infallible this makes them equally incapable of being entrusted with any other Means of Grace and consequently supposes the whole Priests Office to imply a direct Impossbility in the very Notion of it  Your Lordship's Argument is this Christians have their Sins pardon'd upon certain Conditions but Fallible Men cannot certainly know these Conditions therefore Fallible Men cannot have Authority to  Absolve  From hence I take occasion to argue thus Persons are to be admitted to the Sacraments on certain Conditions But Fallible Men cannot tell whether they come qualified to receive them according to these Conditions Therefore Fallible Men cannot have Authority to administer the Sacraments    dly  This Argument subverts all Authority of the Christian Religion it self and the Reason of every instituted Means of Grace For if nothing can be Authoritative but what a Man is infallibly assured of then the Christian Religion cannot be an Authoritative Method of Salvation since a Man by being a Christian does not become infallibly certain of his Salvation Nor does Grace infallibly attend the Participation of the Sacraments So that tho' your Lordship has form'd this Argument only against this Absolving Power yet it has as much Force against the Sacraments and the Christian Religion it self For if it be absurd to suppose that the Priest should absolve any one because he cannot be certain that he deserves Absolution does it not imply the same Absurdity to suppose that he should have the Power of Administring the Sacraments when he cannot be  infallibly  rtain  that those who receive them are duly qualified If a Possibility of Error destroys the Power in one Case it as certainly destroys it in the other Again if Absolution cannot be Authoritative unless it be Infallible then it is plain that the Christian Religion is not an Authoritative Means of Salvation because all Christians are not infallibly sav'd Nor can the Sacraments be Authoritative Means of Grace because  all  who partake of them do not infallibly obtain Grace  Your Lordship proceeds with your Layity by way of Expostulation  If they amuse you with that Power which Christ left with his Apostles Whose soever Sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever Sins ye retain they are retained unto them  Page    But why  amuse  my Lord Are the Texts of Holy Scripture to be treated as only Matter of  Amusement  Or does your Lordship know of any Age in the Church when the very same Doctrine which we now teach has not been taught from the same Texts  Do you know any Successors of the Apostles that thought the Power there specify'd did not belong them But however your Lordship has taught your Layity to believe what we argue from this Text all Amusement and told them  They may securely answer that it is impossible for them to depend upon this Right as any thing certain till they can prove to you that every thing spoken to the Apostles belongs to Ministers in all Ages  Page  The Security of this Answer my Lord is founded upon this False Presumption  viz  That the Clergy can claim no Right to the Exercise of any Part of their Office  as Successors of the Apostles  till they can prove that every thing that was spoken to the Apostles belongs to them  This Proposition must be true or else there is no Force or  Security  in the Objection you here bring for the Instruction of the Layity If it is well founded then the Clergy can't possibly prove they have any more Right to the Exercise of any Part of their Office than the Layity Do they pretend to Ordain Confirm to admit or exclude Men from the Sacraments By what Authority is all this done Is it not because the Apostles whose Successors they are did the same things But then say your Lordship's wellinstructed Layity this is nothing to the purpose Prove your selves Apostles prove that every thing said to the Apostles belongs to you and then it will be allow'd that you may exercise these Powers because they exercised them But as this is impossible to be done so it is impossible for you to prove that you have any Powers or Authorities because they had them  And now my Lord if the Case be thus what Apology shall we make for Christianity as it has been practis'd in all Ages How shall we excuse the noble Army of Martyrs Saints and Confessors who have boldly asserted the Right to so many Apostolical Powers Could any Men in those Ages pretend  that every thing that was spoken to the Apostles belonged to themselves  False then was their Claim and presumptuous their Authority who should pretend to any Apostolical Powers because the Apostles had them when they could not prove  that every thing that was spoken to the Apostles belonged to them  Farther to prove that the abovemention'd Text does not confer the Power of Absolution in the Clergy you reason thus  Whatever contradicts the natural Notions of God and the Design and Tenour of the Gospel cannot be the true Meaning of any Passage in the Gospel But to make the Absolution of weak and fallible Men so necessary or so valid that God will not pardon without them or that all are pardon'd who have them pronounced over them is to contradict those Notions as well as the plain Tenour of the Gospel  Page    Be pleas'd my Lord to point out your Adversary Name any one Church of  England  Man that ever taught this Romantick Doctrine which you are confuting Whoever taught such a Necessity of Absolutions that God will pardon none without them Whoever declar'd that all are pardon'd who have them pronounc'd over them We teach the  Necessity  and  Validity  of Sacraments but do we ever declare that all are sav'd who receive them Is there no  Medium  between Two Extreams No such thing my Lord as  Moderation  Must every thing be thus Absolute and Extravagant or nothing at all  In another Page we have more of this same Colouring  But to claim a Right to stand in God's stead in such a Sence that they can absolutely and certainly bless or not bless with their Voice alone This is the highest Absurdity and Blasphemy as it supposeth God to place a Set of Men above himself and to put out of his own Hands the Disposal of his Blessings and Curses  Page    If your Lordship had employ'd all this Oratory against worshipping the Sun or Moon it had just affected your Adversaries as much as this For whoever taught that any Set of Men could  Absolutely bless  or withold Blessing independent of God Whoever taught that the Christian Religion or Sacraments or  Absolution sav'd People on course or without proper Dispositions Who ever claim'd such an Absolving Power as to set himself above God and to take from him the Disposal of his own Blessings and Curses What has such extravagant Descriptions such Romantick Characters of Absolution to do with that Power the Clergy justly claim Cannot there be a Necessity in some Cases of receiving Absolution from their Hands except they set themselves above God Is God robb'd of the Disposal of his Blessings when in Obedience to his own Commands and in virtue of his own Authority they admit some as Members of the Church and exclude others from the Communion of it Do they pretend to be Channels of Grace or the Means of Pardon by any Rights or Powers naturally inherent in them Do they not in all these things consider themselves as lnstruments of God that are made ministerial to the Edification of the Church purely by his Will and only so far as they act in Conformity to it Now if it has pleas'd God to confer the Holy Ghost in Ordination Confirmation  c  only by them and to annex the Grace of Pardon to the Imposition of their Hands on returning Sinners is it any  Blasphemy  for them to claim and exert their Power Is the Prerogative of God injur'd because his own Institutions are obey'd Cannot he dispense his Graces by what Persons and on what Terms he pleases Is he depriv'd of the Disposal of his Blessings because they are bestow'd on Persons according to his Order and in obedience to his Authority If I should  affirm that Bishops have the sole Power to Ordain and Confirm would this be robbing God of his Disposal of those Graces that attend such Actions Is it not rather allowing and submitting to God's own Disposal when we keep close to those Methods of it which himself has prescrib'd  Pray my Lord consider the Nature of Sacraments Are not they necessary to Salvation But is God therefore excluded from any Power of his own Has he for that reason set Bread and Wine in the Eucharist or Water in Baptism above Himself Has he put the Salvation of Men out of his own Power because it depends on his own Institutions Is the Salvation of Christians less his own Act and Deed or less the Effect of his own Mercy because these Sacraments in great measure contribute to effect it Why then my Lord must that Imposition of Hands that is attended with his Grace of Pardon and which has no Pretence to such Grace but in obedience to his Order and in virtue of his Promise be thus destructive of his Prerogative Where is there any Diminution of his Honour or Authority if such Actions of the Clergy are made necessary to the Salvation of Souls in some Circumstances as their washing in Water or their receiving Bread and Wine Cannot God institute Means of Grace but those Means must needs be above Himself They owe all their Power and Efficacy to his Institution and can operate no farther than the Ends for which he instituted them How then is he Dethron'd for being thus obey'd  My Lord you take no notice of Scripture but in a new Way of your own contend against this Power from the Nature of the Thing Yet I must beg Leave to say this Power stands upon as sure a Bottom and is as consistent with the Goodness and Majesty of God as the Sacraments If the annexing Grace to Sacraments and making them necessary Means of Salvation be a reasonable Institution of God so is his annexing Pardon to the Imposition of Hands by the Clergy on returning Sinners The Grace or Blessing receiv'd in either Case is of his own giving and in a Method of his own prescribing And how this should be any Injury to God's Honour or Affront to his Majesty cannot easily be accounted for  The Clergy justly claim a Power of Reconciling Men to God from express Texts of Scripture and of delivering his Pardons to penitent Sinners Your Lordship disowns this Claim as making Fallible Men the Absolute Dispensers of God's Blessings and putting it in their Power to damn and save as they please But my Lord nothing of this Extravagance is included in it They are only entrusted with a  Conditional  Power which they are to exercise according to the Rules God has given and it only obtains its Effect when it is so exercis'd Every instituted Means of Grace is  Conditional  and is only then effectual when it is attended with such Circumstances as are requir'd by God If the Clergy thro' Weakness Passion or Prejudice exclude  Persons from the Church of God they injure only themselves But my Lord are these Powers nothing because they may be exercis'd in vain Have the Clergy no Right at all to them because they are not  Absolutely infallible  in the Exercise of them  Can you prove my Lord that they are not necessary because they have not always the same Effect May not that be necessary to Salvation which is only effectual on  certain Conditions  Is not the Christian Religion necessary to Salvation tho' all Christians are not sav'd Are not the Sacraments necessary Means of Grace tho' the Means of Grace obtain'd thereby is only Conditional Is every one necessarily improv'd in Grace who receives the Sacrament Or is it less necessary because the salutary Effects of it are not more universal Why then must the Imposition of Hands be less necessary because the Grace of it is Conditional and only obtain'd in due and proper Circumstances Is Absolution nothing because if witheld wrongfully it injures not the Person who is deny'd it and if given without due Dispositions in the Penitent it avails nothing Is not this equally true of the Sacraments if they are deny'd wrongfully or administred to unprepar'd Receivers But do they therefore cease to be standing and necessary Means of Grace  The Argument therefore against this Power drawn from the Ignorance or Passions of the Clergy whereby they may mistake or pervert the Application of it can be of no Force since it is as Conditional as any other Christian Institution The Salvation of no Man can be endanger'd by the Ignorance or Passions of any Clergyman in the Use of this Power If they err in the Exercise of it the Consequences of their Error only affect themselves The Administration of the Sacraments is certainly entrusted to them But will any one say that the Sacraments are not necessary to Salvation because they may through Ignorance or Passion make an ill Use of this Trust  There is nothing in this Doctrine to gratifie the Pride of Clergymen or encourage them to Lord it over the Flock of Christ If you could suppose an Atheist or a Deift in Orders he might be arrogant and domineer in the Exercise of his Powers But who that has the least Sense of Religion can think it matter of Triumph that he can deny the Sacraments or refuse his Benediction to any of his Flock Can he injure or offend the least of these and will not God take Account Or if they fall through his Offence will not their Blood be requir'd at his Hands  Neither is there any thing in it that can enslave the Layity to the Clergy or make their Salvation depend upon their Arbitrary Will Does any one think his Salvation in danger because the Sacraments the necessary Means of it are only to be administred by the Clergy Why then must the Salvation of  Penitents  be endanger'd or made dependent on the sole Pleasure of the Clergy because they alone can reconcile them to the Favour of God If Persons are unjustly denied the Sacraments they may humbly hope that God will not lay the Want of them to their Charge And if they are unjustly kept out of the Church and denied Admittance they have no Reason to fear but God will notwithstanding accept them provided they be in other respects proper Objects of his Favour  But to proceed your Lordship says  The Apostles might possibly understand the Power of Remitting and Retaining Sins to be that Power of Laying their Hands upon the Sick  Pagex    Is this Possible my Lord Then it is  possible  the Apostles might think that in the Power here intended to be given them  nothing at all  was intended to be given them For the Power of Healing the Sick was already confer'd upon them Therefore if no more was intended to  be given them in this Text it cannot be interpreted as having entitled them properly to any Power at all  The Power mention'd here was something that Jesus promis'd he would give them Hereafter Which plainly supposes they had it not then But they then had the Power of  Healing  therefore something else must be intended here  The Power of the  Keys  has always been look'd upon as the highest in the Apostolical Order But if it related only to the Power of Healing it could not be so For the  Seventy  who were inferiour to the Apostles had this Power  The very Manner of Expression in this Place proves that the Power here intended to be given could not relate to  Healing the Sick  or to any thing of that nature but to some  Spiritual Power  whose Effects should not be  Visible  but be made good by virtue of God's Promise Thus  Whomsoever ye shall  heal  on Earth  I will heal  in Heaven  borders too near upon an Absurdity There is no occasion to promise to make  good  such Actions as are good already and have antecedently produc'd their Effects Persons who were restor'd to Health to their Sight or the Use of their Limbs did not want to be assured that the Apostles by whom they were restored had a Power to that End the Exercise of which Power prov'd and confirm'd it self  There was no need therefore of a Divine Assurance that a Person who was healed was actually healed in virtue of it But when we consider this Promise as relating to a  Power  whose  Effects  are not  visible  as the  Pardon of Sins  the Terms whereby it is exprest are most proper And it is very reasonable to suppose God promising that the Spiritual Powers exercis'd by his Ministers on Earth though they do not here produce their  visible Effects  shall yet be made good and effectual by him in Heaven  These Reasons my Lord I should think are sufficient to convince any one that the Apostles could not  possibly  understand these Words in the  Sence of your Lordship  Let us now consider the Commission given to  Peter  Our Saviour said to him  Thou art  Peter  and upon this Rock I will build my Church and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it And I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in Heaven  Now my Lord how should it enter into the Thoughts of  Peter  that nothing was here intended or promised by our Saviour but a Power of Healing which he not only had before but also many other Disciples who were not Apostles  I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven  that is according to your Lordship  I will give thee Power to heal the Sick  Can any thing be more contrary to the plain obvious Sence of the Words Can any one be said to have the  Keys  of the Kingdom of Heaven because he may be the Instrument of restoring People to Health Are Persons Members of Christ's Kingdom with any regard to Health How then can He have any Powers in that Kingdom or be said to have the  Keys  of it who is only empower'd to cure Distempers Could any one be said to have the  Keys  of a Temporal Kingdom who had no Temporal Power given him in that Kingdom Must not he therefore who has the  Keys  of a Spiritual Kingdom have some Spiritual Power in that Kingdom  Christ has told us that his Kingdom is not of this World Your Lordship has told us that it is so foreign to every thing of this World that no  Worldly Terrors  or Allurements no Pains or Pleasures of the Body can have any thing to do with it Yet here your Lordship teaches us that He may have the  Keys  of this Spiritual Kingdom who has only a Power over Diseases My Lord are not Sickness and Health Sight and Limbs Things of this World Have they not some relation to Bodily Pleasures and Pains How then can a Power about Things wholly confin'd to this World be a Power in a Kingdom that is not of this World The Force of the Argument lies here Our Saviour has assur'd us that his Kingdom is not of this World Your Lordship takes it to be of so Spiritual a Nature that it ought not nay that it cannot be encourag'd  or establish'd by any Worldly Powers  Our Saviour gives to his Apostles the Keys of this Kingdom  Yet you have so far forgotten your own Doctrine and the Spirituality of this Kingdom that you tell us He here gave them a Temporal Power of Diseases though He says they were the  Keys of his Kingdom  which he gave them Suppose any Successor of the Apostles should from this Text pretend to the Power of the Sword to make People Members of this Kingdom Must not the Answer be that he mistakes the Power by not considering that they are only the  Keys  of a  Spiritual  not of a Temporal Kingdom which were here deliver'd to the Apostles  I humbly presume my Lord that this would be as good an Answer to your Lordship's Doctrine as to Theirs who claim the Right of the Sword till it can be shewn that  Health  and  Sickness Sight  and  Limbs  do not as truly relate to the Things of this World as the Power of the Sword  If this Power of the Keys must be understood only as a Power of inflicting or curing Diseases then the Words in the proper Construction of them must run thus  Thou art  Peter  and upon this Rock I will build my Church  i e a peculiar Society of Healthful People  and the Gates of Hell shall never prevail against it  i e They shall always be in a State of Health  I will give unto Thee the Keys of this Kingdom of Heaven  i e Thou shalt have the Power of inflicting and curing Distempers  and whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth shall be  bound in Heaven  ie on whomsoever thou shalt inflict the Leprosie on Earth He shall be a Leper in Heaven  and whatsoever thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loos'd in Heaven  i e whomsoever thou shalt cure of that Disease on Earth shall be perfectly cur'd of it in Heaven  This without putting any Force upon the Words is your Lordship's own Interpretation which exposes the Honour and Authority of Scriptures as much as the greatest Enemy to them can wish If our Saviour cou'd mean by these Words only a  Power  of  healing Distempers  or if the Apostles understood them in that Sence we may as well believe that when He said  His Kingdom was not of this World  that he meant it was of this World and that the Apostles so understood him too  But however for the Benefit and Edification of the Layity your Lordship has another Interpretation for them You say  if they  the Apostles  did apply this Power of remitting Sins to the certain Absolution of particular Persons it is plain they could do it upon no other Bottom but this that God's Will and good Pleasure about such particular Persons was infallibly communicated to them  Pray my Lord how or where is this so plain Is it plain that they never baptiz'd Persons till God had  infallibly communicated his good Pleasure to them about such particular Persons  Baptism is an Institution equally Sacred with this other and puts the Person baptiz'd in the same State of Grace  that Absolution  does the Penitent Baptism is design'd  for the Remission of Sin It is an Ordinance to which Absolution is consequent but I suppose Persons may be baptiz'd without such  Infallible Communication  promised as your Lordship contends for If therefore it be not necessary for the Exercise of Absolution by Baptism why must it be necessary for Absolution by the Imposition of Hands  Can Pastors without Infallibility baptize Heathens and absolve or be the Instruments of absolving them thereby from their Sins Are they not as able to absove Christian Penitents or restore those who have Apostatiz'd If Human Knowledge and the common Rules of the Church be sufficient to direct the Priest to whom he ought to administer the Sacraments they are also sufficient for the Exercise of this other Part of the Sacerdotal Office  But your Lordship proceeds thus  Not that they  themselves  Absolved any  No my Lord no more than Water in Baptism of  it self  purifies the Soul from Sin This Baptismal Water is notwithstanding necessary or the Remission of our Sins  Again you say  Not that God was oblig'd to bind and loose the Guilt of Aden according to their Declarations considered as their own Decisions and their own Determinations  Page  No my Lord whoever  ever thought so God is not oblig'd to confer race by the  Baptismal Water  consider'd only as  Water  but He is consider'd as  his own Institution  for that End and Purpose So if these Declarations are consider'd only as  the Declarations of Men  God is not obliged by them But when they are consider'd as the Declarations of  Men  whom he has especially Authoriz'd to make  such  Declarations in his Name then they are as effectual with God as any other of his Institution's whatever  I proceed now to a Paragraph that bears as hard upon our Saviour as some others have done upon his Apostles and their Successors where your Lordship designs to prove that though Christ claim'd a Power of remitting Sins Himself or in his own Person yet that he had really no such Power  You go upon these Words  If we look back upon our Saviour himself we shall find that when he declares that the Son of Man had Power upon Earth to forgive Sins even He himself either meant by it the Power of a miraculous Releasing Man from his Affliction or if it related to another more Spiritual Sence of the Words the Power of declaring that the Man's Sins were forgiven by God  Preservative  p      The Words of our Saviour which we are to look back upon are these  Whether is it easier to say thy Sins are forgiven thee or to say arise take up thy Bed and walk But that ye may know the Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins  Mark As if he had said  Is not the same Divine Authority and Power requir'd Is it not a Work as peculiar to God to perform miraculous Cures as to forgive Sins The Reason therefore why I now chuse to declare my Authority rather by saying  Thy Sins are forgiven thee  than by saying  Arise and walk  was purely to teach you this Truth that the Power of the Son of Man is not confin'd to Bodily Cures but that he has Power on Earth to forgive Sins  This my Lord is the first obvious Sence of the Words and therefore I take it to be the True Sence But your Lordship can look back upon them till you find that Christ has not this Power though he claims it expressly but that he only intends a Power of doing  something or other  which no more imports a Power of forgiving Sins than of remitting any Temporal Debt or Penalty  If our Blessed Saviour had intended to teach the World that he was invested with this Power I would gladly know how he must have express'd himself to have satisfy'd your Lordship that he really had it He must have told you that he had not this Power and then possibly  your Lordship would have taught us that he had this Power For no one can discover any Reason why you should deny it him but because he has in express Words claim'd and asserted it I hope your Lordship has not so low an Opinion of our Saviour's Person as to think it unreasonable in the Nature of the Thing that He should have this Power Where does it contradict any Principle of Reason to say that a  King  should be able to pardon his Subjects Since there is no Absurdity then in the Thing it self and it is so expressly asserted in Scripture it is just Matter of Surprize that your Lordship should carry your Reader from a plain consistent Sence of the Words to  either this or that Something or other  the Origin whereof is only to be sought for in your Lordship's own Invention rather than not exclude Christ from a Power which he declar'd he had and declar'd he had it for this very Reason  that we might know that he had it  Our Saviour has told us that the Way to Heaven is  narrow  Your Lordship might as reasonably prove from hence that he meant it was  broad  as that he did not mean he could forgive Sins when he said  that ye may know that the Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins  Your Lordship has rejected all  Church Authority  and despis'd the pretended  Powers  of the Clergy for this reason because Christ is the  sole King sole Lawgiver and Judge in his Kingdom  But it seems your Lordship notwithstanding thinks it now time to depose him And this  sole King  in  his own Kingdom  must  not be allow'd to be capable of pardoning his own Subjects  This Doctrine my Lord is deliver'd I suppose as your other Doctrines out of a hearty Concern and  Christian  Zeal for the Privileges of the Layity and to shew that your Lordship is not only able to limit as you please the Authority of  Temporal Kings  but also to make Christ himself  sole King  and yet  no King  in his Spiritual Kingdom For my Lord the Kingdom of Christ is a Society founded in order to the Reconciliation of Sinners to God If therefore Christ could not pardon Sins to what End could he either erect or how could he support his Kingdom which is only in the great and last Design of it to consist of Absolv'd Sinners He that cannot forgive Sins in a Kingdom that is erected for the Remission of Sins can no more be  sole King  in it than he that has no  Temporal Power  can be  sole King  in a  Temporal Kingdom  Therefore your Lordship has been thus mighty serviceable to the Christian Layity as to teach them that Christ is not only  sole King  but  no King  in his Kingdom  This is not the First Contradiction your Lordship has unhappily fallen into in your Attempts upon  Kingly Authority  Not is it the Iast which I shall presume to observe to the  Common Sense  of your Layity  Again in this Account of our Blessed Saviour your Lordship has made no difference between Him and his Apostles as to this  Absolving Authority  For you say the  Great Commission  given to them imply'd either a Power of Releasing Men from their Bodily Afflictions or of declaring such to be pardon'd whom God had assur'd them that he had pardon'd And this is  all  that you here allow to Christ himself  Your Lordship's calling him so often  King  and  sole King c  in his Kingdom and yet making him a  Mere Creature  in it is too like the Insult and design'd Sarcasm of the  Jews  who when they had nail'd him to the Cross writ over his Head  This is the King of the Jews  But to proceed Your Lordship proves That our Saviour had not the Power of  forgiving Sins  because  His Way of Expression was Thy Sins are forgiven thee This was plainly to acknowledge and keep up that True Notion that God alone forgiveth Sins  Let us therefore put this Argument in Form Christ has affirm'd that he had Power to forgive Sins But his Way was to say  Thy Sins are forgiven thee  Therefore Christ had not Power to forgive Sins Q E D  It is much your Lordship did not recommend this to your Layity as another  Invincible Demonstration  For by the help of it my Lord they may prove that our Saviour could no more  heal Diseases  than  forgive Sins  As thus Christ indeed pretends to a Power of Healing Diseases but his usual way of speaking to the diseas'd Person was  Thy Faith hath made Thee whole  therefore He had not the Power of  Healing  Diseases The Argument has the same force against one Power as against the other If He did not  forgive Sins  because he said  thy Sins are forgiven Thee  no more did He heal Diseases because he said  thy Faith hath made Thee whole  I have a Claim of several Debts upon a Man I forgive him them all in these Words  Thy Debts are remitted Thee  A Philosophical Wit stands by and pretends to prove that I had not the Power of remitting these Debts because I said  Thy Debts are remitted Thee  What can come up to or equal such  profound Philosophy  but the  Divinity  of one who teaches our Saviour could not forgive Sins because He said  Thy Sins are forgiven Thee  But your Lordship says the Reason why our Saviour thus expressed Himself  Thy Sins are forgiven Thee was plainly to keep up that true Notion that God alone forgiveth Sins  Therefore my Lord according to this Doctrine our Saviour was oblig'd not to claim any  Power that was  peculiar  or  appropriated  to God  alone  For if this be an Argument why He should not  forgive Sins  it is also an Argument that He ought not to claim any other Power any more than this which is proper to God and only belongs to Him But my Lord if He did express himself thus that he might not lay Claim to any thing that was peculiar to God how came He in so many other Respects to lay Claim to such things as are as truly peculiar to God as the Forgiveness of Sins How came He in so many Instances to make Himself equal to God How came He to say  Ye believe in God believe also in me And that Men should Worship the Son even as the Father  That He was the Son of God That he was the Way the Truth and the Life  Are not Evangelical Faith Worship and Trust Duties that are solely due to God Does He not as much invade the Sovereignty of God who lays claim to these Duties as He that pretends to  forgive Sins  Did not Christ also give his Disciples  Power and Authority  over Devils and Unclean Spirits and Power to heal all manner of Diseases  Now if Christ did not assume a Power to  forgive Sins  because God alone could forgive Sins it is also as unaccountable that He should exercise other  Authorities  and Powers which are as strictly peculiar to God as that of forgiving Sins As if a Person should disown that Christ is Omniscient because Omniscience is an  Attribute  of God  Alone  and yet confess his Omnipotence which is an Attribute equally  Divine  But farther my Lord Did our Saviour thus designedly express himself least He should be thought to assume any Power which was Divine then it is certain according to this Opinion that if He had assumed any such Power or pretended to do what was peculiar to God he had been the Occasion of misleading Men into Error For if this be a plain Reason why He expressed himself so as to disown this Power it is plain that if He had own'd it He had been condemn'd by this Argument as teaching false Doctrine  Now if this would have been interpretatively false Doctrine in Christ to take upon Himself any thing that was peculiar to God the Apostles were guilty of propagating this false Doctrine For there is scarce any known Attribute or Power of God but they ascribe it to our Saviour They declare him Eternal Omnipotent Omniscient  c  Is it not a  true Notion  that God alone can Create and is Governour of the Universe Yet the Apostles expresly assure us of Christ that  all things were created by Him  and  that  God hath put all things in Subjection under his Feet  'Tis very surprising that your Lordship should exclude Christ from this Power of  forgiving  Sins tho' he has expresly said He could forgive Sins because such a Power belongs only to God when it appears thro' the whole Scripture that there is scarce any Divine Power which our Saviour himself has not claim'd nor any Attribute of God but what his Apostles have ascrib'd to him They have made Him the  Creator  the  Preserver  the  Governour  of the Universe the Author of Eternal Salvation to all that obey him and yet your Lordship tells us that He did not pretend to  forgive Sins  because that was a Power peculiar to God  Here is then to speak in your Lordship's elegant Style an  immoveable RestingPlace  for your Laity to set their Feet upon here is an  Argument that will last them for ever  They must believe that our Saviour did not forgive Sins  because  this was a Power that belong'd to God tho' the Scriptures assure us that every other Divine Power belong'd to Christ That is they must believe that tho' our Saviour claim'd all Divine Powers yet not this Divine Power  because  it is a Divine Power And my Lord if they have the common Sense to believe this they may also believe that tho' our Saviour took human Nature upon him yet that he had not a human Soul because it is proper to Man They may believe that any Person who has all Kingly Power cannot remit or reprieve a Malefactor  because  it is an Act of Kingly Power to do it or that a Bishop cannot  suspend any Offender of his Diocese because it is an Act of Episcopal Power to do it All these Reasons are as strong and  Demonstrative  as that Christ who claim'd all Divine Powers could not forgive Sins  because  it was a  Divine Power  Lastly In this Argument your Lordship has plainly declar'd against the Divinity of Christ and rank'd him in the Order of Creatures Your Lordship says Christ did not forgive Sins because it is God  alone who can forgive Sins  as plain an Argument as can be offer'd that in your Lordship's Opinion Christ is not God For if you believ'd him in a true and proper Sense God how could you exclude him from the Power of forgiving Sins  because  God alone can forgive Sins It is inconsistent with Sense and Reason to deny this Power to Christ because it is a Divine Power bat only because you believe him not to be a Divine Person If Christ was God then he might forgive Sins tho' God alone can forgive Sins But you say Christ cannot forgive Sins because God  alone  can forgive Sins therefore it is plain that according to your Lordship's Doctrine Christ is not truly or in a proper Sense God  Here my Lord I desire again to appeal to the  Common Sense  of your Laity let them judge betwixt the Scriptures and your Lordship The Scriptures plainly and frequently ascribe all Divine Attributes to Christ They make him the Creatour and Governour of the World God over all blessed for ever Yet your Lordship  makes him a Creature and denies him  such  a Power because it belongs only to God  You your self my Lord have allow'd him to be absolute Ruler over the Consciences of Men to be an arbitrary Dispenser of the Means of Salvation to Mankind than which Powers none can be more Divine And yet you hold that he cannot forgive Sins because Pardon of Sin can only be the Effect of a Divine Power  Is it not equally a Divine Power even according to your Lordship to rule over the Consciences of Men to give Laws of Salvation and to act in these Affairs with an uncontroulable Power as  to forgive Sins  My Lord let their Common Sense here discover the Absurdity for I must call it so of your  New Scheme  of Government in Christ's Kingdom Christ is  absolute  Lord of it according to your self and can make or unmake Laws relating to it can dispense or withold Grace as he pleases in this Spiritual Kingdom all which Powers are purely Divine yet you say he cannot forgive Sins tho' every express Power which you have allow'd him over the Consciences of Men be as truly a  Divine Power  as that of  forgiving Sins  Has not Christ a proper and personal Power to give Grace to his Subjects Is he not Lord over their Consciences And are not these Powers as truly appropriated to God And has not your Lordship often taught them to be so as that of  Forgiveness of Sins  Is it not as much the Prerogative  of God to have any natural intrinsick Power to confer Grace or any Spiritual Benefit to the Souls of Men as to forgive Sins Has not your Lordship despis'd all the Administrations of the Clergy because God's Graces can only come from himself and are only to be receiv'd from his own Hands The Conclusion therefore is this either Christ has a Personal intrinsick Power to confer Grace in his Kingdom or he has not if you say he has not then you are chargable with the Collusion of making him a King in a Spiritual Kingdom where you allow him no Spiritual Power If you say he has then you fall into this Contradiction that you allow him to have Divine Powers tho' he cannot have Divine Powers that is you allow him to  give Grace  tho' it is a Divine Power and not to  forgive Sins  because it is a Divine Power My Lord I wish your Laity if there be any to whom you can render it intelligible much Joy of such profound Divinity Or if there are others who are more taken with your Lordship's Sincerity I desire them not to pass by this following remarkable Instance of it Your Lordship has here as plainly declar'd as Words can consequentially declare any thing that you do not believe Christ to be God yet profess your self Bishop of a Church whofse Liturgy in so many repeated Testimonies declares the contrary Doctrine and which obliges you to express your Assent and Consent to such Doctrine My Lord I here call upon your  Sincerity  either Declare Christ to be Perfect God and then shew why he could not  forgive Sins  or Deny him to be Perfect God and then shew how  you can sincerely declare your  Assent  and  Consent  to the Doctrines of the Church of  England  This my Lord has an Appearance of Prevarication which you cannot I hope charge upon any of your Adversaries who if they cannot think that to be sincere is the only thing necessary to recommend Men to the Favour of God yet may have as much or possibly more Sincerity than those who do think so  Before I take leave of your Lordship I must take Notice of a  RestingPlace  a  strong Retreat a lasting Foundation  i e  a Demonstration in the strictest Sense of  the Words that all  ChurchCommunion  is unnecessary  Your Lordship sets it out in these Words  I am not now going to accuse you of a Heresie against Charity but of a Heresie against the Possibility and Nature of Things  As thus  Mr  Nelson  for Instance thinks himself oblig'd in Conscience to Communicate with some of our Church Upon this you declare he hath no Title to God's Mercy and you and all the World allow that if he communicates with you whilst his Conscience tells him it is a Sin he is selfcondemn'd and out os God's Favour That Notion viz  the Necessity of ChurchCommunion  therefore which implies this great invincible Absurdity cannot be true  Pray my Lord what is this wond'rous Curiosity of a  Demonstration  but the common Case of an  erroneous Conscience  Did the strictest Contenders for ChurchCommunion ever teach  that  any Terms  are to be comply'd with against Conscience But its a strange Conclusion to infer from thence that there is no Obligation to Communion or that all Things are to be held indifferent because they are not to be comply'd with against one's Conscience  The Truths of the Christian Religion have the same Nature and Obligation whatever our Opinions are of them and those that are necessary to be believed continue so whither we can perswade our selves to believe them or not I suppose your Lordship will not say that the Articles of Faith and necessary Institutions of the Christian Religion are no otherways necessary than because we believe them to be so that our Perswasion is the only Cause of the Necessity but if their Necessity be not owing merely to our belief of them then it is certain that our Disbelief of them cannot make them less necessary If the Ordinances of Christ and the Articles of Faith are necessary because Christ has made them so that Necessity must continue the same whether we believe and observe them or not  So that my Lord we may still maintain the necessity of ChurchCommunion and the strict observance of Christ's Ordinances notwithstanding that People have different perswasions in these Matters presuming  that our Opinions  can no more alter the nature or necessity of Christ's Institutions than we can believe  Error  into  Truth Good  into  Evil  or  Light  into  Darkness  I shall  think my self no  Heretick against the Nature of Things  tho' I tell a  Conscientious Socinian  that the Divinity of Christ is necessary to be believed or a  Conscientious Jew  that it is necessary to be a Christian in order to be saved But if your Lordships Demonstration was accepted we should be oblig'd to give up the necessity of every Doctrine and Institution to every Disbeliever that pretended Conscience We must not tell any Party of People that they are in any danger for being out of Communion with us if they do but follow their own Perswasion  Your Lordship's  Invincible Demonstration  proceeds thus  We must not insist upon the Necessity of joyning with any particular Church because then Conscientious Persons will be in Danger either way for if there be a Necessity of it then there is a Danger if they do not joyn with it and if they comply against their Consciences the Danger is the same  What an inextricable Difficulty is here How shall Divinity or Logick be able to relieve us  Be pleas'd my Lord to accept of this Solution in lieu of your Demonstration  I will suppose the Case of a  Conscientious Jew  I tell him that Christianity is the only covenanted Method of Salvation and that he can have no Title to the Favour of God 'till he professes  the Faith of Christ What replies he would you direct me to do If I embrace Christianity against my Conscience I am out of God's Favour and if I follow my Conscience and continue a  Jew  I am also out of his Favour The Answer is this my Lord The  Jew  is to obey his Conscience and to be left to the  uncovenanted unpromised  Terms of God's  Mercy  whilst the Conscientious Christian is entitled to the  express and promised favours of  God  There is still the same absolute necessity of believing in Christ Christianity is still the only Method of Salvation tho' the sincere  Jew  cannot so perswade himself and we ought to declare it to all  Jews  and Unbelievers whatsoever that they can only be sav'd by embracing Christianity That a false Religion does not become a true one nor a true one false in Consequence of their Opinions but that if they are so unhappy as to refuse the Covenant of Grace they must be left to such  Mercy  as is without any Covenant And now my Lord what is become of this mighty Demonstration Does it prove that Christianity is not necessary because the Conscientious  Jew  may think it is not so It may as well prove that the Moon is no larger than a Man's Head because an honest ignorant Countryman may think it no larger  Is there any Person of  Common Sense  who would think it a Demonstration that he is not obliged to go to Church because a  Conscientious  Dissenter will not Could he think it less  necessary to be a Christian because a  sincere Jew  cannot embrace Christianity Could he take it to be an indifferent Matter whether he believed the Divinity of Christ because a  Conscientious Socinian  cannot Yet this is your Lordship's  invincible Demonstration  that we ought not to insist upon the necessity of ChurchCommunion because a  Conscientious Disbeliever  cannot comply with it  A small Degree of  Common Sense  would teach a Man that true Religion and the Terms of Salvation must have the same obligatory Force whether we reason rightly about them or not and that they who believe and practice according to them are in express Covenant with God which entitles them to his Favour whilst those who are sincerely Erronious have nothing but the sincerity of their Errors to plead and are left to such Mercy of God as is without any Promise Here my Lord is nothing frightful or absurd in this Doctrine they who are in the Church which Christ has founded are upon Terms which entitles them to God's Favour they who are out of it fall to his Mercy  But your Lordship is not content with the Terms of the Gospel or a Doctrine that only saves a particular Sort of People this is a narrow View not wide enough for your Notions of  Liberty  Particular Religions and particular Covenants are  demonstrated  to be absurd  because  particular Persons may Disbelieve or not submit to them  Your Lordship must have Doctrines that will save all People alike in every way that their Perswasion leads them to take But my Lord there needs be no greater Demonstration against your Lordship's Doctrine than that it equally favours every way of Worship for an Argument which equally proves every Thing has been generally thought to prove nothing which happens to be the Case of your Lordship's  Important Demonstration  Your Lordship indeed only instances in a particular Person Mr  Nelson  but your  Demonstration  is as serviceable to any other Person who has left any other Church whatever The  Conscientious Quaker Muggletonian Independant  or  Socinian  c have the same right to obey Conscience and blame any Church that assumes a Power of censuring them as Mr  Nelson  had and if they are censur'd by any Church that Church is as guilty of the same  Heresie against the Nature of Things  as that Church which censur'd Mr  Nelson  or any Church that should pretend to censure any other Person whatever  I am not at all Surpriz'd that your Lordship should teach this Doctrine but its something strange that such an Argument should be obtruded upon the World as an unheard of  Demonstration  and that in an  Appeal to common Sense  Suppose some Body or other in defence of your Lordship should take upon him to demonstrate to the World that there is no such Thing as  Colour because there are some People that can't see it or Sounds because there are some who don't hear them He would have found out the only  Demonstrations  in the World that could equal your Lordships and would have as much reason to call those  Hereticks against the Nature of Things  who should disbelieve him and insist upon the reality of Sounds as your Lordship has to call your Adversaries so  For is there no necessity of ChurchCommunion because there are some who don't conceive it Then there are no Sounds because there are some who don't hear them for it is certainly as easie to believe away the  Truth  and  Reality  as the  Necessity  of Things  Some People have only taught us the  innocency of Error  and been content with setting forth its harmless Qualities but your Lordship has been a more hearty Advocate and given it a  Power  over every Truth and Institution of Christianity If we have but an  erronious Conscience  the whole Christian Dispensation is cancell'd all the Truth and Doctrines in the Bible are  Demonstrated  to be unnecessary if we do not believe them  How unhappily have the several Parties of Christians been disputing for many Ages who if they could but have found out this  intelligible Demonstration  from the Case of an erroneous Conscience would have seen the absurdity of pretending to necessary Doctrines and insisting  upon  ChurchCommunion  but it must be acknowledged your Lordship's  new invented Engine  for the Destruction of  Churches  and it may be expected the  good Christians of no Church  will return your Lordship their Thanks for it  Your Lordship has thought it a mighty Objection to some Doctrines in the  Church  of  England  that the Papists might make some Advantage of them But yet your own Doctrine defends  all  Communions alike and serves the  Jew  and  Socinian c  as much as any other sort of People Tho' this sufficiently appears from what has been already said yet that it may be still more obvious to the  Common Sense  of every one I shall reduce these Doctrines to Practice and suppose for once that your Lordship intends to convert a Jew a Quaker or Socinian  Now in order to make a Convert of any of them these Preliminary PROPOSITIONS are to be first laid down according to your Lordship's Doctrine  Some  Propositions  for the Improvement of true Religion  Proposition  I That we are neither more or less in the Favour of God for living in any particular Method or Way of Worship but purely as we are sincere  Preserv  page  Propos  II That no Church ought to unchurch another or declare it out of God's Favour  Preserv  p  Propos  III That nothing loses us the Favour of God but a wicked Insincerity  Ibid  Propos  IV That a conscientious Person can be in no Danger for being out of any particular Church  Preserv  page  Propos  V That there is no such Thing as any real Perfection or Excellency in any Religion that can  justify  our adhering to it but that all is founded in our Personal Persuasion Which your Lordship thus proves  When we left the Popish Doctrines was it because they were  actually  corrupt  No  The Reason was because we thought them so  Therefore if we might leave the  Church of Rome  not because her Doctrines were corrupt but because we thought them so then the same Reason will justify any one else in leaving any Church how true soever its Doctrines are and consequently there is no such Thing as any  real  Perfection or Excellency in any Religion consider'd in it self but it is  right  or  wrong  according to our Perswasions about it  Preserv  page  Propos  VI That Christ is  sole  King and  Lawgiver  in his Kingdom that no  Men  have any Power of Legislation in it that if we would be good Members of it we must shew our selves Subjects of Christ alone without any Regard to Man's Judgment  Propos  VII That as Christ's Kingdom is not of this World so when Worldly Encouragements  are annexed to it these are so many Divisions against Christ and his own express Word  Serm  page  Propos  VIII That to pretend to know the Hearts and Sincerity of Men is Nonsense and Absurdity  Serm  page  Propos  IX That God's Graces are only to be receiv'd immediately from himself  Serm  p  These my Lord are your Lordships own Propositions expressed in your own Terms without any Exaggeration  And now my Lord begin as soon as you please either with a  Quaker Socinian  or  Jew  use any Argument whatsoever to convert them and you shall have a sufficient Answer from your own Propositions  Will you tell the  Jew  that Christianity is necessary to Salvation  He will answer from  Propos I That we are neither more or lesas in the Favour of God for living in any particular Method or way of Worship but purely as we are Sincere  Will your Lordship tell him that the Truth of Christianity is so well asserted that there is no Excuse left for Unbelievers He will answer from  Propos  V  That all Religion is founded in personal Persuasion that as your Lordship does not believe that Christ is come because he is actually come but  because you think he is come so He does not disbelieve Christ because he is not actually come but because he thinks he is not come  So that here my Lord the  Jew  gives as good a reason why he is not a Christian as your Lordship does why you are not a Papist  If your Lordship should turn the Discourse to a  Quaker  and offer him any Reasons for Embracing the Doctrine of the  Church of England  you can't possibly have any better Success any one may see from your  Propositions  that no Argument can be urg'd but what your Lordship has there fully answered For since you allow nothing to the  Truth  of Doctrines or the  Excellency  of any Communion as such it is demonstrable that no Church or Communion can have any Advantage above another which is absolutely necessary in order to persuade any sensible Man to exchange any Communion for another  Will your Lordship tell a  Quaker  that there is any Danger in that particular Way that he is in  He can answer from  Propos  lst d and th  That a Conscientious Person can't be in any Danger for being out of any particular Church  Will your Lordship tell him that his Religion is condemned by the Universal Church  He can answer from  Propos  d  That no Church ought to unchurch another or declare it out of God's Favour  Will you tell him that Christ has instituted Sacraments as  necessary Means  of Grace which he neglects to Observe  He will answer you from  Propos  IX  That God's Graces are only to be received  immediately from himself And to think that  Bread  and  Wine  or the sprinkling of Water is necessary to Salvation is as absurd as to think any Order of the Clergy is necessary to recommend us to God  Will your Lordship tell him that he displeases God by not holding several Articles of Faith which Christ has required us to believe  He can reply from  Propos  III  That nothing loses us the Favour of God  but a  wicked Insincerity  And from  Propos  V That as your Lordship believes such Things not because they are actually to be believ'd but because you think so so he disbelieves them not because they are actually false but because he thinks so  Will your Lordship tell him he is insincere  He can reply from  Propos  VI  That to assume to know the Hearts and Sincerity of Men is Nonsense and Blasphemy  Will your Lordship tell him that he ought to conform to a Church establish'd by the Laws of the Land  He can answer from  Propos  VIII that th  very  Establishment  is an Argument against Conformity  For as Christ's Kingdom is not of this Worl  so when WorldlyEncouragements are annexed to it the  are somany Decisions against Christ and his own express Words  And from  Propos  VII  That seeing Christ is sole King and Lawgiver in his Kingdom an  no M  n have any Power of Legislation in it they wh  would be good Members of it must shew themselve  Subjects to Christ alone without any Regard to Man's Judgment  I am inclin'd to think my Lord that it is now  demonstrated  to the common Sense of the Laity that your Lordship cannot urge any Argument either from the  Truth  the  Advantage  or  Necessity  of embracing the Doctrines of the  Church  of  England  to either  Jew Heretick  or  Schismatick  but you have help'd him to a full Answer to any such Argument from your own  Principles  Are we my Lord to be treated as  Popishly affected  for asserting some Truths which the Papists join with us in asserting Is it a Crime in us not to drop some necessary Doctrines because the Papists have not dropt them If  this  is to be popishly affected we own the Charge and are not for being such  true Protestants  as to give up the  Apostles Creed  or lay aside the Sacraments because they are receiv'd by the Church of  Rome  I cannot indeed charge your Lordship with being  well affected  to the Church of  Rome  or of  England  the  Jews  the  Quakers  Or  Socinians  but this I  ave  demonstrated  and will undertake the De  nce of it that your Lordships  Principles  equally  rve them all alike and don't give the least Ad  antage to one Church above another as has  fficiently appeared from your  Principles  I will no more say your Lordship is in the In  erest of the  Quakers  or  Socinians  or  Papists  han I would charge you with being in the In  erest of the Church of  England  for as your Do  trines equally support them all he ought to ask  our Lordship's Pardon who should declare you  ore a Friend to one than the other  I intended my Lord to have considered another very obnoxious Article in your Lordship's Doctrines concerning the  Repugnancy of temporal Encouragements to the Nature of Christ's Kingdom  ut the Consistency and Reasonableness of guard  ng this Spiritual Kingdom with human Laws  as been defended with so much Perspicuity and Strength of Argument and your Lordship's Objections so fully confuted by the judicious and learned Dean of  Chichester  that I presume this Part of the Controversie is finally determined  I hope my Lord that I have delivered nothing here that needs any Excuse or Apology to the Laity that they will not be perswaded thro' any vain Pretence of Liberty to make themselves Parties against the first Principles of Christianity or imagine that whilst we contend for the positive Institutions of the Gospel  the Necessity of ChurchCommunion or the Excellency of our own we are robbing them of their natural Rights or interfering with their Privileges Whilst we appear in the Defence of any part of Christianity we are engag'd for them in the common Cause of Christians and I am perswaded better things of the Laity than to believe that such Labours will render either our Persons or Professions hateful to them Your Lordship has indeed endeavoured to give an invidious Turn to the Controversie by calling upon the Laity to assert their Libertys as if they were in Danger from the Principles of Christianity But my Lord what Liberty does any Layman lose by our asserting that  ChurchCommunion  is necessary What Privilege is taken from them by our teaching the Danger of certain Ways and Methods of Religion Is a Man made a Slave because he is caution'd against the Principles of the  Quakers  against  Fanaticism Popery  or  Socinianism  Is he in a State of Bondage because the Sacraments are necessary and none but Episcopal Clergy ought to administer them Is his Freedom destroy'd because there is a particular Order of Men appointed by God to minister in Holy Things and be serviceable to him in recommending him to the Favour of God Can any Persons my Lord think these things breaches upon their Liberty except such as think the Commandments a Burden Is there any more Hardship in saying thou shalt keep to an Episcopal Church than thou shalt be baptiz'd Or in requiring People to receive particular Sacraments than to believe particular  Books of Scripture to be the Word of God If some other Advocate for the Laity should out of Zeal for their Rights declare that they need not believe one half of the Articles in the Creed if they would but assert their Liberty He would be as true a Friend and deserve the same Applause as he who should assert the Necessity of ChurchCommunion is inconsistent with the natural Rights and Liberties of Mankind  I am  My LORD  Your Lordship's most Humble Servant William Law  POSTSCRIPT  I Hope your Lordship will not think it Unnatural or Impertinent to offer here a word or two in answer to some Objections against my former Letter  To begin with the Doctrine of the uninterrupted Succession of the Clergy  I have as I think prov'd that there is a Divine Sommission requir'd to qualifie any one to exercise the Priestly Office and that seeing this Divine Commission can only be had from such particular Persons as God has appointed to give it therefore it is necessary that there should be a continual Succession of such Persons in order to keep up a Commission'd Order of the Clergy For if the Commission it self be to descend thro' Ages and distinguish the Clergy from the Laity it is certain the Persons who alone can give this Commission must descend thro' the same Ages and Consequently an uninterrupted Succession is as necessary as that the Clergy have a Divine Commission Take away this Succession and the Clergy may as well be Ordain'd by one Person as another a Number of Women may as well give them a Divine Commission as a Congregation of any Men they may indeed appoint Persons to Officiate in Holy Orders for the sake of  Decency  and  Order  but then there is no more in it than an external  Decency  and  Order  they are no more the Priests of  God  then those that pretended to make them so If we had lost the Scriptures it would be very well to make as good Books as we could and come as near them as possible but then it would be not only Folly but Presumption to call them the Word of God But I proceed to the Objections against the Doctrine of an uninterrupted Succession  First  It is said that there is no mention made of it in Scripture as having any relation to the being of a Church  Secondly  That it is subject to so great Uncertainty that if it be necessary we can't now be sure we are in the Church  Thirdly  That it is a Popish Doctrine and gives them great Advantage over us  I begin with the  st  Objection that there is no mention made of it in the Scriptures which tho' I think have sufficiently answer'd in this Letter I shall here farther consider  Pray my Lord is it not a true Doctrine that  the Scriptures contain all things necessary to Salvation  But my Lord it is no where expresly said that  the Scriptures contain all things necessary to Salvation  It is no where said that no other Articles of Faith need be believed Where does it appear in Scripture that the Scriptures were writ by any Divine  Command Have any of the Gospels or Epistles this Authority to recommend them Are they necessary to be believ'd because there is any Law of Christ concerning the Necessity of believing them  May I reject this uninterrupted Succession because it is not mention'd in Scripture And may I not as well reject all the Gospels Produce your Authority my Lord mention your Texts of Scripture where Christ has  hung the Salvation of Men  upon their believing that St  Matthew  or St  John  wrote such a Book seventeen Hundred Years ago These my Lord are  Niceties  and  Trifles  which are not to be found in Scripture and consequently have nothing to do with the Salvation of Men  Now if nothing be to be held as necessary but what is expresly required in so many Words in Scripture then it can never be prov'd that the Scriptures themselves are a  standing Rule of Faith in all Ages  since it is no where expresly asserted nor is it any where said that the Scriptures should be continued as a Rule of Faith in all Ages Is it an Objection against the Necessity of a perpetual Succession of the Clergy that it is not mention'd in the Scripture And is it not as good a one against the  Necessity  of making Scripture the  standing Rule of Faith in all Ages  since it is never said that they were to be continu'd as a standing Rule in all Ages If things are only necessary for being said to be so in Scripture then all that are not thus taught are equally unnecessary and  consequently it is no more necessary that the Scripture should be a fix'd Rule of Faith in all Ages than that there should be Bishops to ordain in all Ages  Again where shall we find it in Scripture that the Sacraments are to be continued in every Age of the Church Where is it said that they shall always be the ordinary Means of Grace necessary to be observ'd Is there any Law of Christ any Text of Scripture that expresly asserts that if we leave the Use of the Sacraments we are out of Covenant with God Is it any where directly said that we must never lay them aside or that they will be  perpetually  necessary No my Lord this is a  Nicety  and  Trifle  not to be  found in Scripture There is no Stress laid there upon this Matter  but upon things  of a quite different Nature  I now presume my Lord that every one who has common Sense plainly sees that if this Succession of the Clergy be to be despis'd because it is not expresly requir'd in Scripture it undeniably follows that we may reject the Scriptures as not being a  standing Rule of Faith in all Ages  we way disuse the Sacraments as not the  Ordinary Means of Grace in all Ages  since this is no more mentioned in the Scriptures or  expresly  requir'd than this uninterrupted Succession  If it be a good Argument against the Necessity of Episcopal Ordainers that it is never said in Scripture that there shall  always  be such Ordainers  it is certainly as conclusive against the Use of the Sacraments in every Age that it is no where said in Scripture they shall be used in  All Ages  If no Government or Order of the Clergy be to be held as necessary because no such Necessity is asserted in Scripture it is certain this concludes as strongly against  Government  and  the Order it self  as against any  Particular  Order For it is no more said in Scripture that there shall be an Order of Clergy than that there shall be any  particular  Order therefore if this Silence proves against any  particular  Order of Clergy it proves as much against  Order it self  Should therefore any of your Lordship's Friends have so much ChurchZeal as to contend for the Necessity of  some Order  tho' of no particular Order he must fall under your Lordship's Displeasure and be prov'd as meer a  Dreamer  and  Trifler  as those who assert the Necessity of Episcopal Ordination For if it be plain that there need be no  Episcopal Clergy  because it is not said there shall  always  be Episcopal Clergy it is undeniably plain that there need be  no Order  of the Clergy since it is no where said there shall be  an Order  of Clergy Therefore whoever shall contend for an Order of Clergy will be as much condemn'd by your Lordship's Doctrine as he that declares for the Episcopal Clergy  The Truth of the Matter is this If nothing is to be esteemed of any Moment but counted as  mere  Trifle  and  Nicety  among Christians which is not  expresly  requir'd in the Scriptures then it is a  Trifle  and  Nicety  whether we believe the Scripture to be a  standing Rule of Faith  in all Ages whether we use the Sacraments in  all Ages  whether we have any Clergy at all whether we observe the Lord's Day whether we baptize our Children or whether we go to publick Worship for none of these things are expresly required in so many Words in Scripture But if your Lordship with the rest of the Christian World will take these things to be of Moment and well prov'd because they are founded in Scripture tho' not in  express Terms  or under  plain Commands  if you will acknowledge these Matters to be well asserted because they may be gather'd from Scripture and are confirm'd by the universal Practice of the Church in all Ages which is all the Proof that they are capable of I don't doubt but it will appear that this  successive Order of the Clergy  is founded on the same Evidence and supported by as great Authority so that it must be thought of the same Moment with these things by all unprejudic'd Persons  For my Lord tho' it be not expresly said that there shall  always  be a  Succession of Episcopal Clergy  yet it is a Truth founded in Scripture it self and asserted by the universal Voice of Tradition in the first and succeeding Ages of the Church  It is thus founded in Scripture There we are taught that the Priesthood is a  Positive Institution  that no Man can take this Office unto himself  that neither our Saviour himself nor his Apostles nor any other Person however extraordinarily endow'd with Gifts from God could  as such  exercise the Priestly Office till they had God's express Commission for that purpose Now how does it appear that the Sacraments are Positive Institutions but that they are consecrated to such Ends and Effects as of themselves they were no way qualify'd to perform Now as it appears from Scripture that Men  as such  however endow'd were not qualify'd to take this Office upon them without God's Appointment it is demonstratively certain that Men so call'd are as much to be esteem'd a  Positive Institution  as Elements so chosen can be call'd a  Positive Institution  All the Personal Abilities of Men conferring no more Authority to exercise the Office of a ClergyMan than the natural Qualities of Water to make a Sacrament So that the one Institution is as truly Positive as the other  Again The Order of the Clergy is not only a  Positive  Order instituted by God but the different Degrees in this Order is of the same Nature For we find in Scripture that some Persons could perform some Offices in the Priesthood which neither Deacons nor Priests could do tho' those Deacons and Priests were inspir'd Persons and Workers of Miracles Thus  Timothy  was sent to ordain Elders because none below his Order who was a Bishop could perform that Office  Peter  and  John  laid their Hands on baptiz'd Persons because neither Priests nor Deacons tho'  Workers of Miracles could execute that Part of the Sacerdotal Office  Now can we imagine that the Apostles and Bishops thus distinguish'd themselves for nothing That there was the same Power in  Deacons  and  Priests  to execute those Offices tho' they took them to themselves No my Lord if three Degrees in the Ministry are instituted in Scripture we are oblig'd to think them as truly distinct in their Powers as we are to think that the Priesthood it self contains Powers that are distinct from those of the Laity It is no more consistent with Scripture to say that  Deacons  or  Priests  may ordain than that the Laity are Priests or Deacons The same Divine Institution making as truly a Difference betwixt the Clergy as it does betwixt Clergy and Laity  Now if the Order of the Clergy be a  Divine Positive  Institution in which there are different Degrees of Power where some alone can Ordain  c  whilst others can only perform other parts of the sacred Office if this as it plainly appears be a Doctrine of Scripture then it is a Doctrine of Scripture that there is a Necessity of such a Succession of Men as have Power to ordain For do the Scriptures make it necessary that  Timothy  or some Bishop should be sent to  Ephesus  to ordain Priests because the Priests who were there could not ordain And do not the same Scriptures make it as necessary that  Timothy  's Successor be the only Ordainer as well as He was in his Time Will not Priests in the  next Age be as destitute of the Power of Ordaining as when  Timothy  was alive So that since the Scriptures teach that  Timothy  or Persons of his Order could  alone  ordain in that Age they as plainly teach that the Successors of that Order can  alone  ordain in any Age and consequently the Scriptures plainly teach a Necessity of an  Episcopal Succession  The Scriptures declare there is a Necessity of a Divine Commission to execute the Office of a Priest they also teach that this Commission can only be had from particular Persons Therefore the Scriptures plainly teach there is a Necessity of a  Succession of such Particular Persons  in order to keep up a truly  Commission'd Clergy  Suppose when  Timothy  was sent to  Ephesus  to ordain Elders the Church had told him We have chose Elders already and laid our Hands upon them That if he alone was allowed to exercise this Power it might seem as if he alone had it or that Ministers were the better for being ordain'd by his particular Hands and that some Persons might imagine they could have no Clergy except they were ordain'd by him or some of his Order and that seeing Christ had no where made an express Law that such Persons should be necessary to the Ordination of the Clergy therefore they rejected this Authority of  Timothy  lest they should subject themselves to  Niceties  and  Trifles  Will your Lordship say that such a Practice would have been allow'd of in the  Ephesians  Or that Ministers so ordained would have been receiv'd as the Ministers of Christ If not why must such Practice or such Ministers be allow'd of in any afterAges Would not the same Proceeding against any of  Timothy's Successors  have deserv'd the same Censure as being equally unlawful If therefore the Scripture condemns all Ordination but what is Episcopal the Scriptures make a  Succession  of  Episcopal Ordainers  necessary So that I hope my Lord we shall be no more told that this is a Doctrine not mention'd in Scripture or without any Foundation in it  The great Objection to this Doctrine is that this  Episcopal Order of the Clergy  is only an Apostolical Practice and seeing  all  Apostolical Practices are not binding to us sure this need not  In answer to this my Lord I shall first shew that tho' all Apostolical Practices are not necessary yet some may be necessary  Secondly  That the Divine unalterable Right of Episcopacy is not founded  merely  on Apostolical Practice  To begin with the  First  The Objection runs thus  All Apostolical Practices are not unalterable or obligatory to us therefore no Apostolical Practices are  This my Lord is just as Theological as if I should say all ScriptureTruths are not Articles of Faith or Fundamentals of Religion therefore no ScriptureTruths are Is not the Argument  full as just and solid in one Case as the Other May there not be that same Difference between some Practices of the Apostles and others that there is betwixt some ScriptureTruths and others Are all Truths equally important that are to be found in the Bible Why must all Practices be of the same Moment that were Apostolical Now if there be any Way either divine or humane of knowing an Article of Faith from the smallest Truth or most indifferent Matter in Scripture they will equally assist us in distinguishing what Apostolical Practices are of perpetual Obligation and what are not But it is a strange way of Reasoning that some People are fallen into who seem to know nothing of  Moderation  but jump as constantly out of one Extream into another as if there was no such Thing as a middle Way or any such Virtue as  Moderation  Thus either the Church must have an  absolute uncontroulable Authority  or none at all we must either hold  all  Apostolical Practices necessary or  none at all  Again if no Apostolical  Practices  can be unalterable because all are not then no Apostolical  Doctrines  are necessary to be taught in all Ages because all Apostolical  Doctrines  are not and we are no more oblig'd to teach the  Death Satisfaction  and  Resurrection  of Jesus Christ than we are oblig'd to forbid the  eating of Blood and Things strangled  If we must thus blindly follow them in all their Practices or else be at liberty to leave them in all we must for the same Reason implicitly teach all their  Doctrines  or else have a Power of receding from them all  For if there be any Thing in the Nature of  Doctrines  in the  Tenour  of Scripture or the  Sense  of Antiquity whereby we can know the difference of some  Doctrines  from others that some were  Occasional Temporary  Determinations suited to particular States and Conditions in the Church whilst others were such general  Doctrines  as would concern the Church in all States and Circumstances If there can be this difference betwixt Apostolical  Doctrines  there must necessarily be the same difference betwixt Apostolical  Practices  unless we will say that their  Practices  were not suited to their  Doctrines  For Occasional  Doctrines  must produce Occasional  Practices  Now may not we be oblig'd by some  Practices  of the Apostles where the Nature of the Thing and the Consent of Antiquity shew it to be equally necessary and important in all Ages and Conditions of the Church without being ty'd down to the strict observance of every Thing which the Apostles did tho' it plainly appears that it was done upon  accidental  and  mutable  Reasons Can we not be oblig'd to observe the  Lord's Day  from Apostolical  Practice  without being equally oblig'd to  Lock the Doors  where we are met because in the Apostles Times they lock'd them for fear of their Enemies  My Lord we are to follow the  Practices  of the Apostles as we ought to follow every Thing else with  Discretion  and  Judgment  and not run  headlong into every Thing they did because they were Apostles or yet think that because we need not practise after them in every Thing we need do it in nothing We best imitate them when we act upon such Reasons as they acted upon and neither make their  Occasional  Practices  perpetual  Laws nor break thro' such General Rules as will always have the  same reason  to be observ'd  If it be ask'd how we can know what Practices must be observ'd and what may be laid aside I answer as we know  Articles  of Faith from  lesser Truths  as we know  Occasional  Doctrines from Perpetual Doctrines that is from the  Nature  of the Things from the  Tenour  of Scripture and the  Testimony of  Antiquity  Secondly  It is not true that the  Divine unalterable Right  of Episcopacy is founded  merely  upon Apostolical Practice  We do not say that Episcopacy cannot be changed  merely  because we have Apostolical Practice for it but because such is the Nature of the Christian Priesthood that it can only be continued in that Method which God has appointed for its Continuance Thus Episcopacy is the  only  instituted Method of continuing the Priesthood therefore Episcopacy is  unchangeable  not because it is an Apostolical Practice but because the Nature of the Thing requires it A positive Institution being only to be continued  in that Method which God has appointed so that it is the Nature of the Priesthood and not the Apostolical Practice alone that makes it necessary to be continued The Apostolical Practice indeed shews that Episcopacy is the Order that is appointed but it is the Nature of the Priesthood that assures us that it is  Unalterable  And that because an Office which is of no significancy but as it is of Divine Appointment and instituted by God can no otherways be continued but in that way of Continuance which God has appointed  The Argument proceeds thus The Christian Priesthood is a Divine positive Institution which as it could only begin by the  Divine Appointment  so it can only descend to after Ages in such a Method as God has beenpleased to appoint  The Apostles and your Lordship owns Christ was in  all  that they did  Answer to Dr  Snape  instituted Episcopacy  alone  therefore this Method of Episcopacy is unalterable not because an  Apostolical Practice  cannot be laid aside but because the Priesthood can only descend to afterAges in such a Method as is of Divine Appointment  So that the Question is not fairly stated when it is asked whether Episcopacy being an Apostolical Practice may be laid aside But it should be asked whether an instituted particular Method of continuing the Priesthood be not necessary to be continued Whether an appointed  Order of receiving a Commission from God be not necessary to be observ'd in order to receive a Commission from Him If the Case was thus stated as it ought to be fairly stated any one would soon perceive that we can no more lay aside Episcopacy and yet continue the Christian Priesthood than we can alter the Terms of Salvation and yet be in Covenant with God  I come now my Lord to the Second Objection  That this uninterrupted Succession is subject to so great uncertainty that if it be necessary we can never say that we are in the Church  I know no Reason my Lord why it is so uncertain but because it is founded upon  Historical Evidence  Let it therefore be considered my Lord that Christianity it self is a  Matter of Fact  only convey'd to us by  Historical Evidence  That the  Canon of Scripture  is only made known to us by  Historical Evidence  that we have no other way of knowing what Writings are the word of God and yet the Truth of our Faith and every other Means of Grace depends upon our Knowledge and Belief of the Scriptures Must we not declare the Necessity of this Succession of Bishops because it can only be prov'd by  Historical Evidence  and that for such a long tract of Time  Why then do we declare the belief of the Scriptures necessary to Salvation Is not this  equally putting the Salvation of Men upon a  Matter of Fact  supported only by  Historical Evidence  and making it depend upon Things done seventeen hundred Years ago Cannot  Historical Evidence  satisfie us in one Point as well as in the other Is there any Thing in the Nature of this Succession that it can't be as well asserted by  Historical Evidence  as the Truth of the Scriptures Is there not the same bare possibility in the Thing it self that the Scriptures may in some important Points be corrupted as that this Succession may be broke But is this any just Reason why we should believe or fear that the Scriptures are corrupted because there is a Physical Possibility of it tho' there is all the Proof that can be requir'd of the contrary Why then must we set aside the Necessity of this Succession from a  bare possibility of  Error tho' there is all the Proof that can be requir'd that it never was broken but strictly kept up  And tho' your Lordship has told the World so much of the  Improbability Nonsense  and  Absurdity  of this Succession yet I prormise your Lordship an Answer when ever you shall think fit to shew  when  or  how  or  where  this Succession broke or  seem'd  to break or was  likely  to break  And till then I shall content my self with offering this Reason to your Lordship why it is  morally impossible  it ever should have broken in all that Term of Years from the Apostles to the present Times  The Reason is this it has been a receiv'd Doctrine in every Age of the Church that no Ordination was valid but that of Bishops This Doctrine my Lord has been a constant Guard upon the  Episcopal Succession  for seeing it was universally believ'd that Bishops  alone  could Ordain it was  morally impossible  that any Persons could be receiv'd as Bishops who had not been so Ordain'd  Now is it not  morally impossible  that in our Church any one should be made a Bishop without  Episcopal Ordination  Is there any possibility of forging Orders or satealing a Bishoprick by any other Stratagem No it is  morally impossible  because it is an acknowledg'd Doctrine amongst us that a Bishop can only be ordain'd by Bishops Now as this Doctrine must necessarily prevent any one being a Bishop without  Episcopal Ordination  in our Age so it must have the same effect in every other Age as well as ours and consequently it is as reasonable to believe that the Succession of Bishiops was not broke in any Age since the Apostles as that it was not broke in our own Kingdom within these forty Years For the same Doctrine which preserves it forty Years may as well preserve it forty hundred Years if it was equally believ'd in all that space of Time That this has been the constant Doctrine of the Church I presume your Lordship will not deny I have not here enter'd into the Historical Defence of it this and indeed every other Institution of the Christian Church  aving been lately so well defended from the Ecclesiastical Records by a very excellent and  dicious Writer  Original Draught of the Primitive Church  We believe the Scriptures are not corrupted because it was always a received Doctrine in the Church that they were the  standing Rule of Faith  nd because the Providence of God may well be suppos'd to preserve such Books as were to con  ey to every Age the Means of Salvation The  ame Reasons prove the great improbability that his Succession should ever be broke both be  ause it was always against a receiv'd Doctrine  break it and because we may justly hope  e Providence of God would keep up his own  nstitution  I must here observe that tho' your Lordship often exposes the Impossibility of this Succes  on yet at other times even you your self and  our Advocates assert it Thus you tell us  That the Papists have one regular Appointment or un  terrupted Succession of Bishops undefil'd with the  uch of Layhands  Preserv p  Is this Succession then such an  improbable impossible  Thing and yet can your Lordship assure  that it is at  Rome  that tho' it beseventeen  undred Years old there yet that it is a true  ne Is it such  Absurdity  and  Nonsence  and every Thing that is  Ridiculous  when we lay claim to  it and yet can your Lordship assure us that it is not only possible to be but  actually  is in being in the Church of  Rome  What Arguments or Authority can your Lordship produce to shew that there is a Succession there that will not equally prove it to be here  You assert expresly that there is a  true Succession  there you deny that we have it here therefore your Lordship must mean that we had not Episcopal Ordination when we separated from the Church of  Rome  And here the Controversie must rest betwixt you and your Adversaries  whether we had Episcopal Ordination then  for as your Lordship has expresly affirm'd that there is this uninterrupted Succession in the Church of  Rome  it is impossible that we should want it unless we had not Episcopal Ordination at the  Reformation  Whenever you Lordship shall please to appear in Defence of the  Nagg'shead Story  or any other Pretence against our Episcopal Ordination when we departed for  Rome  we shall beg leave to shew our selves so far true Protestants as to answer any  Popish  Arguments your Lordship can produce  Here let the  Common Sense  of the Laity be once more appeal'd to Your Lordship tells them that an  uninterrupted Succession  is improbable absurd and  morally  speaking  impossible  and for this Reason they need not trouble their Heads about it yet in another Place you positively affirm that this  true  uninterrupted Succession  is actually in the Church of  Rome  That is they are to despise this Succession because it never was or ever can be yet are co believe that it  really  is in the  Romish  Church My Lord this comes very near  saying  and  unsaying to the great Diversion of the Papists  Must they not not laugh at your Lordship's  Protestant Zeal  which might be much better call'd the  Spirit  of Popery Must they not be highly pleas'd with all your Banter and Ridicule upon an  uninterrup  ed Succession  when they see you so kindly except theirs And think it only  Nonsense  and  Absurdity  when claim  d by any other Church Surely my Lord they must conceive great Hopes of your Lordship since you have here rather ch  se to contradict your self than not vouch for their Succession For you have said it is morally impossible yet affirm that it is with them  The third Objection against this  uninterrupted Succession  is this that it is a  Popish Doctrine  and  gives Papists advantage over us  The Objection proceeds thus we must not assert the Necessity of this Succession because the Papists say it is only to be found with them I might add because some mighty zealous Protestants say so too  But if this be good Argumentation we ought not co tell the  Jews  or  Deists  c that there is any Necessity of embracing Christianity because the  Papists  say Christians can only be saved in their Church  Again we ought not to insist upon a true Fait  because the  Papists  say that a true Faith is on  in their Communion So that there is just  much Popery in teaching this Doctrine as  asserting the Necessity of Christianity to a  or the Necessity of a right Faith to a  Socinian  c  I shall only trouble your Lordship with a Wor  or two concerning another Point in my forme  Letter I there prov'd that your Lordship ha  put the whole of our Title to God's Favou  upon Sincerity  as such  Independent of ever  Thing else That no Purity of Worship no excellence of Order no Truth of Faith no Sort o  Sacraments no Kind of Institutions or any Church  as such  can help us to the least Degree of God's Favour or give us the smallest Advantage above any other Communion And consequently that your Lordship has set sincere  Jews Quakers Socinians Muggletonians  and all  Hereticks  and  Schismaticks  upon the same Bottom as to the Favour of God with sincere Christians  Upon this my Lord I am called upon to prove that these several Sorts of People can be  Sincere  in your account of Sincerity To which my Lord I make this Answer either there are some sincere Persons amongst  Jews Quakers Socinians  or any kind of  Hereticks  and  Schismaticks  or there are not if there are your Lordship has given them the same title to God's Favour that you have to the sincerest Christians if you will say there are no sincere Persons amongst any of them then your Lordship Damns them all in the Gross  for surely Corruptions in Religion profess'd with unsincerity will never save People  I have nothing to do to prove the Sincerity of any of them if they are Sincere what I have said is true if you will not allow them to be Sincere you condemn them all at once  Again I humbly suppos'd a Man might be sincere in his  Religious Opinions  tho' it might be owing to  some ill Habits  or  something Criminal  in Himself that he was fallen into such or such a way of Thinking Bus it seems this is all  Contradiction  and no Man can be sincere who has  any Faults  or whose  Faults  have any  Influence  upon his way of Thinking  Your Lordship tells all the  Dissenters  that they may be easie if they are sincere and that it is the only Ground for Peace and Satisfaction But pray my Lord if none are to be esteemed  sincere  but those who have no Faults or whose Faults have no Influence upon their Perswasions who can be assur'd that he is  sincere  but he that has the least Pretence to it the  Proud Pharisee  If your Lordship or your Advocates were desir'd to prove your Sincerity either before God or Man it must be for these Reasons because you have no ill Passions or Habits no faulty Prejudices no past or present Vices that can have any Effect upon your Minds My Lord as this is the
