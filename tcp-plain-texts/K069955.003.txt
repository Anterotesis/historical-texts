LETTERS  Containing necessary first questions and enquiries for the use of all travellers  LETTER I  Necessary questions in English Dutch and German for travellers who mean to pass only a few hours or days at a place  p  LETTER II  For the service of those who wish to reside abroad  p  GLEANINGS c  LETTER LVI  I HAVE purposely put off hitherto one important but disastrous subject to the last moment although I have now for the space of some years in my different traversings of the continent been placed as it were in the very eye and ear of it You feel that I mean the dreadful public and yet more fatal private wars of this and many other countries on this  unhappy  side of the English Channel  What my loved friend is the matter with them all  "Sure 'tis the very error of the moon  "She comes more near the earth than she was wont  "And makes men mad"  Does it proceed from the sacred flame of liberty which exalts the human almost to the divine nature or are the nations filled with  clamours  for that which no man felt the want of and with care for freedom which has never been in danger  Springs it from a due sense of that proud principle within us which points at the right which every honest individual has to rank with the loftiest of the species when measured by the standard of nature or from that factious and discontented spirit which prompts the worst of mankind to trouble the repose and plunder the possessions of the best Comes it from true patriotism or from that party rage which "robs it of its good name" It proceeds from all these But with respect to  Equality  on the literal idea as the mob are encouraged for reasons they cannot penetrate to conceive it was there ever such a daydream To make the absurdity more egregious yet more palateable it is called  natural  equality Preposterous as false What dear friend in nature is equal Survey her productions from the first to the last from the most gigantic to the most minute as well in animals as man what is there which she has not  created  UNEQUAL even by express order of the Creator And by that very  inequality  intending to promote the wisdom force and felicity of the whole Amongst the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field the grand  line of subordination drawn by nature goes on Would you give to the linnet the wing of the eagle or to the turnspit the speed of the greyhound To what end Would not nature by that exchange be violated in her general laws and would the beings themselves be the better for it Am I told that all these creatures were put under the subjection of man and that he as the lord of all below can have naturally no superior but the God that gave him life The argument rests then it seems on the natural equality of  human  creatures Fallacious again For of all the beings in the scale of the universe man if we except his origin concerning the  equality  of which he has no more right to be proud than the worm that devours his carcase is the most subject to the laws of natural  in  equality The point which places him at the top of the creation is certainly his soul for his body whether a masterpiece of beauty or a mass of deformity is alike corruptible and rather an object of humiliation than triumph But were you disposed to select from the diversified works of nature any specimen of her wonderful variety and irregularity could you fix on any thing so proper to display that irregularity that variety as the human mind So far from there being herein an universal equality there is nothing so  unequal  amongst all the performances of Creation The strength of the lion is not more remote from the feebleness of the gnat nor the swiftness of the reindeer from the tardiness of the snail than the distance between the power and weakness velocity and slowness of men's souls and understandings Nature by uncontroulable laws has established that to one man should be given an head to plan govern and command to another hands to toil and obey Innumerable are the gradations from those who guide the helm of the state to those who regulate the steerage of a simple skiff from the noblest architect to the most ordinary artificer The harmonies of civil society are carried on by the joint assistance of all these in their  proper places  take them out of which and transpose them put the one into the station of another and in short jumble them together on the plea of natural equality according to the new system and what results from all this What becomes of civil society and of the world Doth not such a farce upon the decent subordinations and arrangements of nature fill it with discords disorders and death Look into the page of ancient annals and into the more sanguinary history of modern timeswhat do they exhibit but a tissue of absurdity horror and blood  Can it be supposed that were these at length to subside by the establishment of Republicanism on the ruins of Monarchy that the happiness of mankind which ought to be the aim and end of all governments would be the effect Let the toiling hand govern and the projecting head obey Would not confusion be indeed confounded Or shall all men have an equal share in the direction of human affairs Shall there be no governors no governed Shall families societies states and empires be without an head Shall all be common right and common fellowship The comet my friend were it "to rush lawless through the void" would not trail so much mischief in its course as such a number of licentious orbits out of their proper spheres The wolves and tygers of the forests acknowledge it is true no superior and they sometimes troop in grim association and fell bandittl to lay waste the countries through which they pass they are it must be owned notable republicans and are unanimous to destroy whatever they meet with but they destory each other also and are bad examples of the success of an universal republic instituted on the levelling principle The wolves and tygers of human kind if suffered to roam through the wilderness of life without any check on passions  more fierce and fatal than any bestial appetiteor if controuled only by those laws which are instituted by what are called patriots only because they avowedly differ from and oppose any order in a creation that is sustained by order onlywould soon make the universe more intolerable to its inhabitants than any abuse which power has yet introduced into the government of the world and the most disloyal being would again call out like the frogs in the fable for a king and rather than any longer be left to the anarchy of being delivered over to themselves would pray for one tyrant supposing no honest prince would then accept of them in exchange for an universe of despots  But farther how egregiously absurd my friend is this new doctrine Are not all large bodies of men compelled to have governors and chiefs And do not these imply command and obedience and do not these argue in their very name and nature authority and subjection What are the Admirals Generals Colonels Captains and Subalterns of the present French armies but heads What are the soldiers and sailors they govern or direct but subordinate members In what consists the difference betwixt these and former commanders whether  ministerial or military Alas nothing but "the whistlings of a name" Call it Aristocracy and the gentlest government becomes tyranny give it the name of Democracy and there is no slavery too hard to be endured Nay the very men who are such sticklers for equality who have even fought and bled for it continue to this very hour to make the proudest distinctions amongst men even in a state of mutual captivity The first thing that struck me in my visit to Weyzel a celebrated town as you know of Westphalia was the seeing a number of Republican French officers prisoners walking on the parade attended by their  servants  Two of these latter were receiving the orders of their masters with their heads uncovered and their bodies bent in a very unrepublican manner What in a state of common calamity are these nice distinctions to be made thought I are brother prisoners to keep up this lofty difference Are those who have levelled the earth so soon unmindful of their leading maxim "All men are equal" One of the superiors I thought there were to be no superiors grew angry chid his domestic and sent him from his presence Could the old constitutioncould despotism do more I saw the obedient slave with the most servile  shrug of his country and of his condition go slinking away So much for confraternity  My friend a skilful use of words substituting one for another as time and circumstance may require will apparently change the nature of things but real liberty and slavery are the same beautiful and bitter potions denominate them what you will and the tyrant is not less an oppressor for altering his name to that of a friend to freedom indeed some of the worst enemies that freedom ever had in all ages and countries have assumed this sacred character  Point out to me the Despot that has not called himself a lover of his people and of his country Under this specious mask I have within a few years been an eyewitness to no less than two formidable insurrections in this little Republic on the verge of which I am now writing I am far from being sure that I shall not be spectator of a  The third has come to pass  third though one would have thought either of the two former might have written on the hearts of the people the WISDOM OF CONTENT in characters of blood That which raged in is so well and faithfully written by an English author who calls  his work an history of the late Dutch Revolution that I shall not only refer but recommend you to a perusal of it A few of the miserable particulars I shall give you on the authority of personal knowledge But not till I again resume the pen to assure you amidst the storm of contending nations"the wrecks of matter" and the almost "crush of worlds" I am affectionately yours  LETTER LVII TO THE SAME  WE talk much and with much reason of the wild excesses of our English mobs my dear friend Their sanguinary disposition has been compared to that of our English bulldogs which are said to be insatiate of blood when they have once drawn it from the objects of their attack Our British insurrections are no doubt marked like others by some of the prominent features of rebellion in all countries devastation flames and untimely death But I did not know how great an enemy man could be to man nor had I a clear idea to what an extent human beings could go in the destruction of one another  although I am not unread in the bloody story of my own country till I began to glean the more dreadful annals of others The six years that have elapsed since I beheld in Holland the demon of civil fury associated with party madness far from having abated the memory of their dire effects are felt methinks with a stronger horror from having observed similar outrages in other quarters of the agitated globe Unhappy Holland while one party were attempting to destroy thee and themselves by fire and sword rapine and slaughter the other were wreaking vengeance against thy best fairest and most innocent possessionsupon thy wives and children  While one side I say my friend were thus outraging all order decency and compassion the other manifested no less fury The party of the Stadtholder and that of the patriots were alike infected with the poison of the times It reached the bosoms even of the gentler sex as an instance of which pardon me if I make your nature recoil even as mine did on the day my flowing eyes bore testimony to it A party of patriots had taken and killed in the town of Boisleduc one of the Princes adherents who had been active in the cause of the Stadtholder His defeat was  therefore a kind of triumph a groupe of people soon gathered round the body yet struggling betwixt life and death Amongst the rest were two women who had been fetching water from the public fountains One of these no sooner understood the cause of the mob's collecting than she poured out about two thirds of the water from her pail which she placed under the wounds of the murdered citizen whose blood was thus mingled with the water when pledging the surrounding populace she exclaimed as she drank with more than savage fury "May rivers of this flow through the streets till our enemies are vanquished" And to such a pitch of enthusiasm was this carried that as one more example I must inform you another patriot quarrelled with the beautiful rainbow and shot at it because the orange mingled in its hues this was nearly as mad and irreverent as the dressing up the figure of the Virgin Mary with a red bonnet and writing under the cross of our Saviour the man Jesus the  cidevant  Redeemer of the world  All comments of the moralist my friend are lost and all effusions of the peaceful lover of mankind absorbed on occasions like these for breaches of this sort in nations like old and incurable wounds though they are often  skinned over conceal an unsubdued venom which gathers strength and virulence and then again break out Private families we know may after "some imminent and deadly breach" reunite from policy or principle or from some reliques of affection but even this is a patched up accommodation and after a violent open rupture whether in empires or the little domestic commonwealths that form them the whole history of mankind furnish few examples where the parties have sincerely forgiven one another Many months after the Prince's party had been reinstated in its privileges and the patriot faction not only yielded to authority but appeared to have forgot its animosity I had but too many illustrations of the foregone remark On the breaking out of the rebellion in other countries I again heard the voice of sedition and the more than  murmurs  of disaffection in various parts of these disunited states Sacred be the love of rational liberty But the fever of freedom is a wildfire that is more desolating than any other contagion that of Constantinople is not so suddenly imbibed nor does it travel with unimpaired venom so far or so fast It is a pest that seizes distant nations and strikes with the rapidity and the force of lightning Even when Holland seemed to have got the better of  this political plague its poisons were undermining her constitution and like those fires which are burning in the bowels of the earth unseen are inwardly consuming its entrails and making their way to the surface I was in Holland when she was precisely in this situation prepared for her second shock and waiting only for the signal of her  expatriated firebrands  the banished Dutch patriots then forming a part of the French army to give the explosion Breda was taken Gorcum was inundated and the cannonade of Williamstadt thundered to the very sea and prepared the patriots of the provinces for the reception of their exiled friends  In my way to Helveotsluice in order to embark for England every countenance I looked into carried the marks of fear loyalty ambition or revolt Notwithstanding the cautious jealousy natural to power and all the vigilance of the magistrates little knots of people were to be observed gathered together in corners of the street and in byeplaces where it was thought the eye of authority would not penetrate My wandering steps which so often led me into unfrequented places and thereby as you have seen make me tread upon many a secret led me to the haunts of these Dutch  malecontents They were always to be seen in that earnest and earapproaching whisper which so often betrays its treasons the forefinger extended the button caught at and held fast or shook most rebelliously the mouth of the speaker contracted so as to send forth only the unbetraying voice of conspiracy and that of the hearer on the contrary opened to its width to swallow the treason while the eyes of the party communicating like a pair of sentinels ordered to defend the door of the lips seemed to keep double watch lest as Shakspeare says  "The babbling gossips of the air  "Should prate of their  whereabout  "  Artizans burgomasters priests and peasants were thus insidiously or fearfully gathered together either to express their apprehension their hope or their despair were to be detected in these communities and had not the whole country been threatened with a very serious calamity it would not have been unamusing to a Gleaner who delights  "To catch the living manners as they rise"  It is not unentertaining to see the little shifts which persons engaged in secret conversations of any kind make to prevent being discovered the immediate change they make on the  first view of an intruderthe sudden alteration from an aweful to a careless air as the said intruder approaches the tones varied from almost in distinct whispers and portentous meetings to louder accents now walking on now stopping a little as if engaged in ordinary conversation the subject of which while you have an eye on them is changed as often as their positions I took notice while I paused at Helveotsluice that as their friends on the other side of the water that is to say the enemies of their country were more rapid in their advances while their very fires were in sight and the patriots on the Helveot side were almost opening their arms to receive them these secret meetings were less visible It is a crisis at which the  mind  of a conspiracy is made up the component parts of which perfectly understanding their plans lie in wait to put them in execution assuming in the mean time the mask of welldissembled loyalty for strange as it may seem vice when swelled to its  height  and just about to shew itself borrows the semblance of its opposite virtue in the robes of which it is then most assiduous to cover itself Thus drunkenness affects temperance incontinence chastity avarice generosity detraction candour impiety religion and faction which would hurl a sovereign  from his throne in that moment is the loudest to sing forth the praises of royalty  But treachery my dear friend is never so perilous never so fatal as when it thus hides itself and would seem the thing it is not From a foe whom I observe taking aim at me I may escape by accident by courage or by address but from the stroke of an assassin whom though I once knew him to be my enemy my believing heart at length considers as a penitent friend I am so far from being guarded that to use the words of one of our old poets  "I lay my sleeping life within his arms"  Thus it was with the several inhabitants of Holland They had done speaking and were now prepared to act and the moment of that action was waited for with the sullen malignity and gloomy pastime which characters a cold and determined nature such as many of the natives of Holland possess They waited for their longwished revenge in silence but it was a silence that resembled the fearful stillness of the sky when the thunder is gathering force but the silence of a Hollander when once his part is taken is more to be apprehended than the thunder itself of which I  gleaned an instance that is in reserve for you Perhaps I have raised your curiosity and therefore you shall have this dire example of Dutch revenge here  Two brothers on some very slight occasion quarrelled and from being inmates separated houses neighbourhood and at length broke connexion their alienation was neither softened nor embittered by correspondence After about eleven years past in this manner one of the brothers married a beautiful woman The single brother who had been watching his opportunity of vengeance made his appearance very unexpectedly on the weddingday and desiring an interview with the married man in a separate apartment was no sooner perceived than welcomed the latter taking it for granted he came to be reconciled and had chosen this distinguished day to render it more acceptable The bachelor thus addressed the bridegroom  Brother we have not met since our disagreement divided us this day eleven years I come now to remind you of the circumstanceThus  striking a poniard into the heart of the bridegroom who had just power to gain the apartment of his bride who was then dancing with one of her husband's friends Scarcely could he exclaim that he  was murdered ere he sunk down and expired at her feet and while the company and servants were employed about their friend and master the assassin coolly mounted his horse and made his escape  Alas my friend it is with the patriotism that embraces all my fellowcreatures and their happiness that I apprize you that our present sheaf must be deeply spotted with their blood the mingled blood of beauty and deformity innocence and guilt The scenery which is yet in store was partly painted amidst the tranquillity of returning peace and partly amidst the horrors of returning war  Often have I been within sight not seldom within hearing of two of the fiercest oppositions that ever desolated the works of man and God You will not be surprised to learn that the impression which such scenes has made upon an eye and earwitness should have filled his mind with materials that lie fresh in his memory and bleed in his heart How many towns villages and all that they inherit have I seen blooming on the one day with beauty wealth content and happy countenances despoiled deformed impoverished and deluged in tears and in blood upon another The pictures of these taken both in the one position and in the other must be given They  shall be delineated with simple historical truth for neither romance nor fable in their wildest warmest colourings could can or has ever reached them  Possibly the Gleaner is the first traveller who hath yet described the happiness of nations at peace and the misery of such nations at war in a residence immediately  before  and  after  the violations of public tranquillity He has viewed as well the havock of battle in its most intense rage as the cold horrors that succeeded conquest He has luxuriated in countries when the horn of plenty filled them with fertility and fragrance and deplored even as if his property were mingled in the common wreck the withering effects of victory after the enemy had torn up all the works of nature and of man the most fair and the most cherished He has been amongst the last to quit and the first to revisit a threatened country and evacuated town and has observed the labours of a life a century annihilated in a single day the desolations of every work of art and the more affecting ruins of human beings Before he set out on this last tour of which he has here drawn the faint outline he had seen public misery and felt its effects his reading had furnished him  with recorded horrors in the bloody history of his own country but all this was but the  shadow  of the disaster which the excursion alluded to has brought closer under his eye and yet closer to his heart  Descending by degrees in a step that receded in proportion as the enemy advanced I found myself almost imperceptibly once more in Holland whose armies still freezing upon the banks of the Maise and Lower Rhine must perhaps again have recourse to the assistance of her great  waterdog  to whom she has more than once owed the salvation of her Republic and indeed this sturdy guardian ought to do infinite good since he cannot be let loose upon the enemies of the state without abundant mischiefan inundation of the country being next to captivity and its consequences the greatest evil Would you believe after all which has happened since my former gleaning of the United States after all the faithful traditions of horror bloodshed pillage and blasphemy which have been placed before them that I find again here the self same spirit of disaffection grown more gigantic and with increase of ferocity proportioned to augmentation of force For the disaffection of more  arbitrary  States of France herself for instance  I can more easily allow and account but one would have thought that a Republicattached as is that of Holland to all those things which the French people now most hold in scorn person property life and religion and with the bleeding testimonies of rapine devastation and death before their eyesone would have thought I say that in such a country amongst such a people who have much to lose and nothing to gain the fury of party by which they have so often unmercifully suffered and are suffering at this moment in every limb and artery of the Republic might have been moderated if not destroyed Surely the desperation of liberty like that of love baffles all reasoning and mocks at all sober laws Even the richest merchants of the United Provinces men who must on the very principles of equality at least divide the labours and gains of life with those who subsist only by an opposite set of principles which levels idleness and industryeven such men pant for the complete triumph of the common enemy and are ready to sacrifice not only their fortunes but their familiesto what to false ideas of freedom and to revenge What could they acquire the gratification of an ancient grudge What must they lose Every thing else But so cold and so dark is their feeling on this subject  they would consider it as a cheap  The purchase has been made we shall see how long they continue pleased with their bargain  purchase  But the spreading flame is not confined to Holland The Gleaner has traced its progress through the provincial petty towns of Austria where a slender passage of the Rhine separates the inhabitants from their utterly ruined neighbours friends and countrymen on the other side he has seen and heard the look and tone of determined Revolution and if he has at one moment observed one man retreating with fear he has in the next noticed more than one remaining fixed to his household in hope of the destroyer In numberless places believe me a  protecting  army is an object of silent yet obvious hate and one which menaces captivity is welcome Along the banks of the Maise as of the Rhine even though their waves may be almost said from the alchemy of commerce to flow with  gold  the very worshippers of that precious mischief would gladly tinge its billows with blood In Westphalia in Prussia he has followed in every direction the like power You cannot get into a publichouse boat or carriage but the water and the  land reechoes with the illdissembled voice or loyalty or the avowed and bolder tones of faction  In short the fever is more universal than any other that has yet raged in the world It seizes on all ages sexes and countries and though millions have already died of it the fury rather increases than abates I have seen old fellows in their grand climacteric to whom an easy chair and a warm peaceful hearth one would think might comprise all the liberty sighed for I have seen such receive with exultation every account of a fortress destroyed a village burned or a city desolated even though adjoining their own Like the malignant Zanga but unsupported by Zanga's motives of revenge they  "Love the rocking of the battlements  "It suits the gloomy habit of their souls"  In a word in a circuit of many hundred leagues I have seen a spirit of revolt to the ruling power whether emperor stadtholder or king that rises amongst the ruins and stirs up insurrection amidst the very ashes of thrones and dominions Adieu  LETTER LVIII TO THE SAME  YOU told me I remember in one of your late favours that I had mingled in my sheaves many a bloody wreath Alas it is but the blushing signal of those events which are doomed to outrage the feelings of every gentle heart In the character of an historical Gleaner I shall ere long be called upon to afflict the reader and my friend yet more the most terrifying truths are to be told truths over which I have wept and shuddered but over which I nevertheless hope should the peruser of these pages shed a tear and shudder also he will find a balm sufficient to the wound Amidst the pangs of  general  philanthropy every  Britonborn reader at least  will feel at his heart the beatitude of his  particular  happiness in being a member of  that  island which although by comparative extent it measures but as a speck in the map of the world is the natal residence of the fortunate and the almost sole sanctuary of the unhappy proportions of the globe  But however my countrymen and my friends are to be felicitated on this circumstance I sorrow to distress them by delineating the sad reverse and therefore will  "Spare the telling since it be a pain"  as long as possible  The hurry and agitation of public affairs have led me to some anticipations the crouding incidents of the moment the now gathering now dispersing storms of war have made me break in upon my reserves prematurely and  that  to the neglect of many a more pacific and smiling scene To these I shall return with a satisfaction that I flatter myself you will share as it will for a while suspend every more turbulent subject and empower me to conduct you gradually along till you almost forget we are approaching scenes of devastation By such means too I shall rather break the blow upon your feelings than take them by surprize nay more as our paths to the seats of war lie through some of the most charming parts of Westphalian Prussia I shall even strew those paths with flowers  I am now again addressing you from Nimeguen the last considerable town of the Dutch  territory where after having employed the rest of this letter in a few Gleanings properly belonging to Holland and the Provinces we will journey onward  "Sedate to think and watching each event"  and with our accustomed privileges  "Try what the open what the covert yields"  You have in recollection I trust my Gleanings of the Dutch theatre when the ghost of Hamlet stalked upon the stage of Holland during the Hague fair On a revisitation of that celebrated town some days ago I found that a troop of German actors had been permitted to take possession of the playhouse situated in the Casuàrystreet which the French comedians convicted of Jacobinism as I informed you had evacuated The first piece at the representation of which I attended was called I think The Robber in which amongst several very finewrought and as fine acted scenes was  one  turning upon an event so preposterous that I must relate it to you The hero of the performance is a young man who in the first instance robs his own father and eloping from his paternal house carries his plunder to a desperate banditti who have their haunts in a deep forest and with such associates he shares the plunder and the crimes Notwithstanding  his companions have had strength enough over the virtues of his youth to extinguish his sense of duty to an aged and almost helpless parent and one of the tenderest that ever bore the name and even to make him forego the endearing society of a lady to whom he was powerfully attached they had not force of seduction sufficient to eradicate entirely the vital principle of nature and conscience which at various periods broke forth in sighs of remorse and blushes of shame The "cunning of the scene" affords many displays of these and in the lucid returns of his heavilysmitten heart he rescues that very parent and that very muchloved though deserted mistress from the barbarity and machinations of an elder brother This brother is also by his means and by the most equitable laws of human life as well as of the drama brought to just punishment and by arrangements no less proper the father is restored to the freedom and honours which his eldest son had ravished from him and the young lady is preserved from violation By such means the parties long divided by the vices are brought together by the virtues of this heroic robber Forgiveness of the father and of the mistress are matters of course and the reconciliatory scenes which exhibit these are as naturally sustained  as the incidents by which they are brought about are artfully contrived Every thing is in the fairest way of being settled to the satisfaction of the characters and of the audience I never witnessed the  denouement  of a tragedy more comfortably arranged for the feelings But the author was of a different opinion for in the moment that you are about to congratulate this good ending of as bad a beginning the poet starts a difficulty which I conceive neither nature or reason suggested to him The almost converted robber even while supported on the one hand by the love of a father and on the other by that of an adored mistress finds out that having  sworn  to live and die with his forest companions he cannot violate his oath and that even if he could his delicacy would not suffer him to carry pollution into the arms of an innocent woman  Now if you approve of this  stroke of delicacy  I could wish to stop at it but as a faithful Gleaner I must proceed to inform you that our delicate hero by no means contents himself with this declaration but while his hand is joined by a parent to that of a mistress who covers it with tears of joy and kisses of love he literally  "Threws it like a noisome weed away"  observing that although he feels it impossible to marry the lady himself he cannot endure the thought of her living for another This new misfortune sinks the father to the ground upon which he is left to die on one side of the stage while the lady stands statuestruck with grief on the other Neither of these objects go to the heart of our hero On the contrary he intimates that there is no way left to pacify his fears on this curious point of delicacy but the death of this beloved mistress Hereupon the poet makes her obligingly take the hint by throwing herself into an attitude to receive the blow from the hand of her lover who however rather hesitates about it upon which the lady presents her beautiful bosom all heroines you know  must  be beautiful to any of the robbers none of whom can be found to  "Scar that whiter skin of her's  "Than monumental alabaster"  when men who live by pillage and murder are thus tenderhearted I am justified in applying the quotation though I should consider myself as having a sufficient sanction on the  determined  laws of the drama to enrol amongst their unities those of heroism and personal beauty  The Ruffians however all unsheath their swords and might perhaps have been wrought upon to cut in twain the silken bonds of humanity that held them a moment uplifted had not the hero come forth in all the  might  of his delicacy in the shape of  a rant  loud and vehement as ever pierc'd "the ears of the groundlings" to assert  his  sole and exclusive claim to the assassination Saying which and a great deal more he takes the woman of his heart  gently  in his arms then buries his dagger  gently  in her breast then supports her  gently  as she sinks on the earth where  gently  placing her on the side opposite that of his dead father on whose body by the bye dying or dead he never bestows a glance and then  gently  embracing his robberfriends he stalks off to kill himself at a more convenient season and thus concludes this  gentle  piece of business of which if any thing  could  add to the absurdity it would be the circumstance of having just before found himself wholly incapable of stabbing his worthless brother because though stained with the foulest offences against his dear father and dearer mistress he was forsooth a good for nothingbrother If this is not  refining upon refinement  and  outsentimentizing sentimentality  the deuce is in it Few of my readers but must allow this was carrying the  point of delicacy  a little too far and for my part if this is the German method of settling the point I remain a steady admirer of the coarse English fashion of stabbing  any body  and indeed almost  every  body rather than the woman of one's heart  But the truth is this is  not  the German mode any more than it is ours as I have shewn and shall still shew in various instances It is the act and deed solely of the  author of this drama  who has therein not only put his heroine to death for his own amusement but has committed an assassination upon a much greater character even  nature herself  and this is one example out of an hundred that has made me wish gentlemen who have the life and death of their characters as dramatick writers in their hands would be a little less lavish of human at least of poetical blood without shewing cause in the courts of  reason nature  and  conscience  Not that I mean to attach this strain upon dramatic or natural laws to the productions of the German poets in general They very frequently write and act with the most accurate knowledge of the human heart and seldom fail to find their way to it when their purpose is to interest its affections  I was indeed soon recompensed for the above related outrage of probability by the performance which I saw at the same theatre a few nights after when all was  "Nature to advantage dress'd"  It was properly speaking a gala play being represented in honour of the Prince Stadtholder's birthday one of the few very occasional events which bring a sufficient number of people to fill the Hague theatre for although it is not larger than Colman's in the Haymarket there is rarely audience enough to pay for the few pounds of candle bestowed to illumine the gloom and doubtless this is one reason why there is not more light thrown upon the audience of the Hague On this great occasion however there were about  half  as many lamps stuck over the Stadtholder's box as would have been placed on the board of his Britannick Majesty's corncutter on the th of June and even the under tier of sconces that usually stand unoccupied were filled with wax In a word I beheld the astonishing circumstance of a Dutch theatre  crowded  and instead of "  the beggarly account of empty boxes  I found myself amongst the flower and fashion of the Hague  After being waited for by the actors and the audience the decent time that is just long  enough to wind up expectation to the proper pitch without straining its springs his Serene Highness and his Royalblooded partner made their appearance the first in a modest suit of slightlyornamented blue broad cloth the last according to the etiquette made and provided in these cases glittering in white silver tissue Brunswick's eldest hope was shining at their side and his Duchess attended the graceful and lovely Princess Hereditary in the stagebox decorated for that night only to receive them  But alas all this was but the gay disguise of a concealed anxiety or rather it was but the trapping and incumbrance of a comfortless situation too mighty for disguises Three days and nights previous to this theatrical exhibition of themselves had the Prince Princess and train been made the illustrious victims of this anniversary martyrdom and every moment that was not devoted to the bendings bowings and other pliabilities of the court was seized upon by the camp for it was the time when above a thousand soldiers were preparing to replace the devastations of the last campaign in Flanders The Stadtholder is indefatigable in his military duties and these happening to fall at the period when he was to receive the compliments of the nobility and  gentry on gaining the fortysixth year of his age you will not wonder to hear that he brought to the playhouse a weary head and perhaps an aching heart the more especially as it was said an heavy piece of public news had been received from the frontiers which it was necessary to hush up in his own mind and in that of his august partner in distress lest it should check the ardour of the troops about to take their departure There is you know a crisis in splendid as well as other misery at which the oppressed spirits and faculties take refuge in sleep It appeared to be exactly this crisis when the party abovementioned gained the theatre for scarce had the natal salutations been received and acknowledged than a deep sleep fell upon both their Highnesses and upon the Prince of Brunswick Never did I see three illustrious personages so oddly disposed of They sunk subdued into a comfortable nap as if it had been a preconcerted thing to refresh themselves at the theatre with a doze of this sort and which to say the truth they stood sadly in need of It seems they had been exhausting themselves in public affairs and ceremonies from five in the morning to midnight of the preceding day But that the anodyne was very powerful may be gathered from their enjoying it almost unbroken through the three long acts  of a German opera spun to the length of as many German miles Once indeed his  Serene  Highness opened half an eye and cast it in a dizzy way first at the sleeping princess then at the snoring duke as if to explore the cause that roused him but perceiving it was only the crash of instruments in a general chorus by way of  finale  to the second act he again bid adieu to unwelcome recollections in the oblivious arms of that power which is very justly called the kind "restorer of nature" I could not help a reflection on the different allotments of human kind as I saw the most illustrious of the audience the only parts of it which were unable to enjoy either the harmony or the pleasantry of the entertainment and altogether insensible to the surrounding splendours We rave about and we are bleeding at every pore and fermenting in every vein for  Equality  my dear friend we are hearing perpetually of the necessity of bringing the poor on a level with the rich nobles with peasants and kings with beggarsah God of them all with how little reason with how little recollection of the history of  human conditions  The worst and the most unhappy is probably that which winds up the climax and so on of the series since it is most likely the houseless beggar who eats his morsel of alms under a hedge of thorns when  the rude hand of winter had torn off every sheltering leaf in remembrance of the day that brought into the world the brat which he buckles to his back has a more exquisite relish of that morsel and is more soothed by the gratulations of his weatherbeaten companions than the Prince and Princess of the Republic of Holland sleeping amidst the felicitations of a theatre or in truth any prince or princess in these times Equality alas were all men reduced to a level  like this  how soon would those who till then perhaps without being conscious of it had experienced the blessings of an humble state wish again for the refuge and distinction of poverty Whosoever has looked on the fatigues weight and peril of the elevations amongst mankind must know this and it is strange there should be found any one so unreasonable as to envy the exalted this gilding of their care and misery As to the eminent examples in question happy to see them enjoy this temporary respite I was sorry when the fall of the curtain awakened and dismissed them to new fatigues  Whatever might be their fate for the rest of that night to new fatigues the Stadtholder at least was destined the succeeding morning The troops which had cost him so much trouble  to make ready were to march at eight o'clock Without using literary privileges which allow authors to blot out the sun or command him to send forth his most effulgent beam having you know a charter from Parnassus to do as we please with the elements I assure you in the prose simplicity of truth that  really  "The dawn  was  overcast the morning low'r'd  "And heavily in clouds brought on the day"  Nay more those clouds very soon after the Stadtholder reached the parade broke on his unsheltered head for the indispensible ceremonies of a fieldday were to be exchanged and his Royal Highness princes not counting amongst their prerogatives the liberty of controlling the skies to their purpose got a ducking more severe than that I have recorded in a former letter One would again be led to think that "there was more in these matters than philosophy can find out" for really had the clouds been in combination against him they could not have spouted down a more inauspicious torrent It was not however of sufficient vehemence to damp his martial attention neither had it the force to chill public curiosity consequently it was set at defiance by powers stronger than either curiosity or martial ardour Never on any public occasion did  I see such a collection of human beings Every passion of the heart and every feeling of nature were here met together In the form either of patriots princes men wives mistresses children officers or soldiers you might have observed hate allegiance love hope and despair You might have remarked also a few smiles of heroism amidst many bitter tears of apprehension The disasters of the last campaign were had in  bleeding  remembrance and there were those amongst the disaffected inhabitants who exclaimed  See what a brave shew of fellows are waiting  orders to march to the shambles  Alas this exclamation has since proved in some late instance so late as the th and th of April last but too prophetic and although the military entré of the young Imperial Monarch has been marked with glory one cannot but regret it has been marked with so much of the blood of his allies Many of the very men whom the Gleaner beheld that day leaving their country have bade it an eternal adieu It is the fate of war but one shrinks from the thought and I wish I had not  een them all alive It is weakness perhaps but forgive me  Insidious whisperings of this kind had been in circulation for some time and several desertions had taken place in consequence upwards of twenty on the night immediately preceding their march Nor was this the worst a dispiriting kind of alarm pervaded the soldiery  who performed their military preparations with reluctant delay I had noticed many of them standing the day before their departure by the side of their baggage waggons as if they were taking a survey of their hearses filling them with their beds c as if they presaged they would prove their beds of death Others were following these vehicles with all their marching apparatus not with eyes that anticipated victory but with downcast looks and solemn steps to dirgelike measure as if they were moving after the coffin of a comrade and the beat of the drum that acts so wonderfully upon the spirits in certain moments now seemed to sound in their ears the dead march  Examples of every kind are known to be contagious in no instance perhaps more than in their influence upon our hopes and fears courage and cowardice are communicated in a moment they are even  transferred  with electric rapidity from one man to another the bosom of the brave catching an unwonted apprehension and the breast of the dastard glowing with even an unnatural ardour as the poisonous breath of disaffection or the exhilarating powers of loyalty are diffused amongst them It is a lamentable thing when private houses or public empires are set against themselves  States are only large families united by the same laws and bound by the same interest The connexions of the nearest ties in private life are scarce more close nor ought they to be more sacred As the welfare of man and wife so the prosperity of nations my friend  "When those whom heav'n ordains to will the same  "Look different ways unmindful of each other  "Think what a train of wretchedness ensues"  Unfortunately for the well being of these  United States  which by the bye is and has long been a misnomer the two parties that are dismembering it are in perpetual counteraction While the one is diligently labouring to knit the provinces together the other perhaps more industrious for mischief is a very active power works day and night though working often underground to render that honest diligence ineffectual and vigilant malignity will always be more or less successful  On this important morning however the Stadtholder rallied the halfseduced energies of his soldiers he saluted them first generally then particularly he complimented and with great justice their martial appearance cheered  them with a prince's smile distributed amongst them a prince's bounty bestowed with welltimed address a prince's eulogy on their known valour c c  "A little flattery sometimes does well"  He manifested by fifty little attentions that he considered them as the faithful defenders of the Republic and in short put in motion every wheel of a good general a goodnatured prince and a good man His deportment had a visible effect on the troops into whose countenances there came as if by reflection a sudden and promising brightness the morning itself began to look more cheerfully and the officers with their men duly equipped from the orange branches in their hats to the neat knapsack at their backs took their march through the streets leading to Schedamtheir first day's marchaccompanied to the outer gate of the town by tens of thousands of spectators  If some few of those thousands heaved a sincere sigh of loyalty for the return of the troops victorious and uninjured how many secretly or to say the truth openly desired and hoped they might be vanquished and cut to pieces How strange does this seem how unnatural does it sound  "Is it not as if this mouth  "Would tear this hand for lifting food to it"  With respect to the Hollanders the liberty to say and do what they like in defiance of all inhibited things and as usual with the more eager audacity because forbidden is  Not one of the motives that urged the French people had the Dutch  "to spur the sides of  their  intent  "Save vaulting ambition"  which the Gleaner thinks will in  their  case at least be found to have  "O'erleap'd itself"  their's  and as to their being taxed do they consider that they live in a country made by industry in despight of nature who intended it to be only one of her enormous bogs while the ancestors of this grumbling but hardworking hive set "doggedly to it" as Dr Johnson says to make it into productive land and a more productive water a pile of stupendous art from one end to the other and not to be kept in repair without extraordinary taxation Do they grudge this Would they let the edifice run to ruins and be buried amongst them Would they heap up their money bags to sink them with themselves more profoundly in the  returning  bog Will the French or their native patriots mend either their country or  their commerce Let them try Ingenious laborious absurd wise foolish preposterous people  Here then let us bid a long and probably a last adieu to the United Provinces on which we have bestowed more liberal observation than they have been wont to receive but not more than they have deserved as the most curious and astonishing efforts of a patient powerful and vigilant people A like farewell to Guelderland for whose prosperity I shall have a warm wish were it only for the sake of the opportunity it gives of  losing one's way  and  finding the Man of the Forest  Blessed be every leaf of every tree which comes under the axe of that man And blessed be you my friend aye and ye my readers Westphalia invites but I cannot quit one country and take you into another without separating them and their inhabitants by a little pause in our correspondence  LETTER LIX TO THE SAME  I HAVE in a former gleaning noted the wonderful progressive relief from low to high land and from wet to dry from stagnant canals to running streams as you proceed in your journey from the United Provinces to the Upper Countries This is less sensibly felt after a few days or weeks ramble in Guelderland but could the traveller be suddenly transported from the Province of what is properly called Holland to those blooming edges of Westphalia to which I am now conducting you he would imagine that  one  was the purgatory of sinful and the  other  the paradise of happy souls The fabled waters of the Styx and of Elysium are not more strongly contrasted The very air as well as the water takes a purer breath Not that in point of vegetable or rural grandeur Westphalian Prussia is to be compared to several parts of Dutch Guelderland but in point of unambitious and eversmiling scenery I have never seen any thing superior The houses and the land and indeed the inhabitants of Holland resemble nothing but themselves  The charming Duchy of Cleves and "all that it inherits" resembles the most beautiful unassuming parts of England You have scarce reached the first Prussian town which is midway betwixt Nimeguen and Cleves the name of which is Cuylenberg ere your native country presses on your heart you seem to be carried by some magician into the midst of its alluring scenery its whited cottages comfortable farms and cultured grounds are all within your view You are struck at almost every step with the similitude It is the agreeable and beautiful but not the sublime of nature There is nothing of hill or vale water or wood to astonish the traveller but there are numbers of objects always fresh and always charming and a prospect of great abundance I am speaking here of the Duchy of Cleves in a circumference of its best possessions a  coup d'oeil  of more than fifty miles for on a clear day your eye can travel to this extent if it takes sight from any of the delightful little eminences near the town of Cleves particularly from a mount in the wood which gives you the command of half a dozen noble avenues each a mile in length at the end of which your view is bounded by the prettiest towns in the Circle of Westphalia and Province of Guelderland The eye rests satisfied and refreshed  it wishes not to penetrate beyond these beautiful limits The Cleves wood is in itself full of charms artificial and natural but by the former I only mean the stately and somewhat formal rows of trees which shade and canopy the almost numberless paths that are cut through it Yet admitting this to be an objection to the lover of nature in all her graceful wildness there are to be found in this wood an infinity of byewalks where nature is permitted to enjoy her utmost romance and to sport her "virgin fancies" and which perhaps derive additional charms from the contrast with the more  disciplined  vegetation This fine wood is fenced round with the old Englishlooking parkpaling thatched as it were with grey moss as with us and as with us the chaffinch greenfinch goldfinch and "all the other finches of the grove" as the Critic says are seen pecking at it on a fine spring morning to build the outworks of their nests I have haunted this wood at all times and seasons and trust therefore you will be pleased with both a summer and winter account of it There appears to be something remarkable in the foliage of Westphalia to be observed in the most dreary months With us even in our most extended forests the trees and bushes are almost stripped of their withered foliage In GreatBritain  and in Holland autumn scarce leaves a trace behind her when the "surly winter" as our poet of nature beautifully calls him "with his ruffian train" has usurped her empire It is far otherwise in Westphalia The underwood not only of the enduring oaks but of all other sorts of more tender shrub wood scarcely sustain the loss of a leaf a general russet such as we see in the English groves when they put on their November robes covers whole acres till the end of March when it is most likely nature is arrayed in her spring dress in Great Britain Respecting the trees of forest growth they are here as in the general roads of France and in the avenues that lead to our antique mansions of England planted in the straight line but their regularity as to height and extent gives them one appearance at the present moment singular and agreeable Three or four days of rain with the intervals of a dry southern air have given them such an universal blush that though nothing like a leaf is to be seen in alleys of several thousand trees cut into different roads at right angles and is simply the effect of a swell amongst the buds you have the promise that the very next sunny day will  invert  Shakspeare's muchcriticised expression  making the green  ONE  red  by making the  red  ONE  green  for on cropping one of these blooming  twigs and pressing the buds with your finger you perceive them bursting into infant vegetation  Eight and forty hours of genial weather so changes these glowing branches that the eye regales in a prospect of that tender verdure which in vegetable as in human life gives the freshness and complexional delicacy which belongs only to the most  early youth of nature  so sweet to behold and alas so soon destroyed Neither the broad foliage of a more advanced Spring nor the rich expansion and colouring of confirmed Summer offer any thing so pure There are you know the same changes productive of the same effects in the progress of life in the several stages of  its  Spring Summer and Autumn  Suffer me now to carry you about Cleves Land Imagine that you are seated on one of the rustic benches in a retired part of its delicious wood while I recount to you the gleanings of several tours in its neighbourhood  The town of Cleves in itself has nothing to recommend it but the excessive beauty of its situation It is a large straggling illpaved place with many good houses and more bad  It is however the capital of the Duchy and under the domination of his Prussian majesty Though so near to Holland and with such an example of neatness before their eyes the inhabitants of Cleves by no means deign to follow it On the contrary they are in their houses streets and not unfrequently in their persons the most disgusting contrastsbut of these disagreeable matters hereafter  As I reached the environs of the town the first day my affections were very singularly interested Indeed I know not when they have been more powerfully called forth where the objects of their sympathy were taken not from the human species but from the animal world About a mile from the Westerngate I perceived a man and boy busied in doing something to the most beautiful ox I ever beheld as I came nearer I found they were adorning it with a great variety of fanciful ornaments' a large collar of yew branches tied with ribbon and wreathed with other evergreens were thrown over its neck painted papers on which were drawn herds flocks and shepherds and folded into large beau knots were fixed I am afraid  pinned  with large corkers to its skin in various parts of the body bunches of the same were tied to the tail braided into the mane  and the brows were hung with a garland of holly of which there was a twist fastened by red filleting even to the horns on the tips of which were stuck little Maybushes in bloom  My attention was presently called off from this by the bleat of a sheep and its lamb those creatures were bound to an hedge in a corner of the same enclosure They were dressed nearly in the taste of the ox with this variation in the lamb a collar of several early spring flowers of the field and some twigs of hawthorn in bud and which betwixt sport and earnest it was trying to get into its mouth On asking the cause of all this finery I was told it was upon account of its being a  jourdefête  and also the day before that of the greatest beef mutton and lamb market in the whole year  And pray friend said I where is the necessity of dressing the animals in that manner  'Tis our custom Sir replies the man driving the ox towards the town and the boy with the sheep and lamb now unbound following his example  I had not time for more interrogatories being wholly taken up with the anticks of the  lamb which frolicking sometimes with its mother and sometimes with the boy and sometimes even with its own shadow brought so close under my eye and so near indeed to my very heart the fine lines of Mr Pope that I repeated them over and over Every image of his description had its immediate illustration in the objects before me  "The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day  "Had he thy reason would he skip and play  "Pleas'd to the last he crops the flow'ry food  "And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood  We gained Cleves as I pronounced for the tenth time that impressive verse which gives the moral of the former stanza  "O blindness to the future  kindly  given"  The animals were led or rather driven through the principal streets literally for a  shew  it being the practice of Westphalia for the butchers to exhibit their meat  alive  the day preceding the slaughter I pretend to question neither the use nor the necessity of all this nor by any means to stretch pity or feeling beyond their bound I only observe to you that my affections followed these creatures in their  funeral  procession through the town of Cleves and could not leave them till on turning a narrow lane I saw with a kind of emotion you  will easily guess the door of the place destined for their destruction it being a practice in this country to slaughter their meat and a very filthy one it is  The same vise custom prevails in several parts of Holland  in the open street the pavements and kennels of which are stained and running with blood  I will carry you no farther into this little adventure than just to note that being the next day obliged to pass the end of the street where I took leave of my poor dumb companions I observed not only several parts of them hang upon hooks at the butcher's shop but several of the ornaments Even the flowers that were wreathed about the face of the lamb were now crouded into its mouth and spotted with its harmless blood Poor little fellow said I thou wert yesterday the merriest of the frisking tribe Would I never had met thee  If in the course of the week it was my lot to  eat  any part of these animals at the tables where I then visited as it is most probable was the case consider  poor human nature  and forgive me I am not preposterous enough to advise a being who is made up of appetites to abstain from the gratification of such as are necessary to existence but while we yield to the stern laws of our mortality let us not you I am sure  will not spurn all sort of feeling like the man who on seeing some lambs at sport in a meadow exclaimed"Ah ye dear innocent beautiful creatures would to heaven I had a joint of ye today for dinner with nice spinnage and butter"  A very different sentiment sprung up in my mind as I surveyed the amputated limbs of these my late associates You remember what the heartmelting Otway says on the subject  "Lead lead me like a tame lamb to sacrifice  "Thus in his fatal garlands fine and pleas'd  "The wanton skips and plays  "Trots by th' inticing flattering priestess side  "And much transported with his little pride  "Forgets his dear companions of the plain  "Till by her bound he's on the altar lain  "And then too hardly bleats  Never can this affecting passage be more touchingly illustrated than in the case of my lamb of Westphalia  The sheep of this very beautiful country however are not so welllooking nor so good in point of food as might be expected from the rich abundance of their pasturage and the purity of their air They are longer in the visage body and legs than ours Their fleeces are more ragged and dirty How different in colour and countenance from the fair flocks  gleaned in our first sheaf that climb the mountains and frisk along the valleys of our Cambria A sheep in Wales is really an interesting being you see its mild face peep unexpectedly from the fissure of a rock in the midst of an enormous pile of ruinous stones or you have a full length view as it reposes at the mouth of a fine natural cave or you observe it looking down upon you from a stupendous ridge of rocks on the extreme verge of which it seems to hang till you feel something like an apprehension it should tumble into the vale below and be destroyed but even while your sympathy is thus engaged in its welfare the wanton creature wild as the wind that bleaches it and romantic as the spots on which it feeds will bound from the dizzy precipice where it stood to an height yet more fearful and projecting its neck beyond where you imagine it possible for it to keep the due equilibrium will crop the herbage that vegetates amongst the stony ruins or the flower that makes its flinty bed in the rocks and will continue to climb and descend places the perpendicular of which makes your eyes ake and your head giddy but the Cambrian sheep takes its  pastime  amongst these apparent dangers with so much ease and gaiety you are soon convinced it is rather an object of your envy than compassion  Now in Westphalia and in most other parts of Prussia and Germany these animals after they have outlived the frolicks of lambhood have less of this playfulness and indeed become very soon a set of serious ruminating ragged and solemn creatures  The dog that guards them however is generally a very pleasant fellow He is taught to dance and has many other laughable humours and accomplishments but in his business is indefatigable Wholly unlike the curs of England where the apathy of the master seems contagious and where even when following their flock both appear to be  walking in their sleep  the shepherd dogs of this country are like so many perpetual motions if the shepherd wishes to have them driven from one part of pasturage to another to divide to congregate or to conduct them to their fold his dog begins his office which is performed in the following manner He runs round them in a circle or rather three parts of a circle leaving the fourth part open for their passage and he barks all the time If any straggler loiters by the way he enlarges his round till it includes the wanderer who is brought up with the rest He does his work in two equal spaces of ground running from right to left and from left to  right It is truly a curious operation and not a little fatiguing since it sometimes continues an hour together without a moment's respite from barking and running But like many others it is for the most part labour in vain The sheep are so much in the habit of hearing this eternal yelper that so far from attending to his cries I question whether they hear his voice like those persons who live within the sound of bells At any rate they pay no regard to it for while he is in full cry the sheep step as leisurely as if he was six feet under ground even the ox I have mentioned in a former part of this letter and my poor lamb round whom he galloped in the same way heeded him not The first turned him as it were into contempt and the last into ridicule looking at him without fear while his mouth was wide open and full of antic joining him in his race So that I begin to think our English shepherd's cur does the business more effectually  While I am upon the subject of the canine race of which you know I am a professed friend and admirer let me not forget to inform you of an excellent custom prevalent in Holland and in Westphalia respecting those animals in the dogdays namely the law  which enacts their being shut up during the sultry season The appearance of a dog of any kind in the streets at such times is punished with just severity Now as canine madness perhaps the most lamentable distemper incident to human kind is very rarely heard of in the various parts of the Continent that are the objects of these Gleanings we must impute it principally to the caution here described "Go and do likewise" is an admonition worthy the adoption of the people of England who suffer deplorable instances of distraction and death arising from the want of some regulation on this subject  Far far from the friend of my heart be every malady of the body and of the mind  LETTER LX TO THE SAME  CLEVES may be enrolled amongst the watering places but as those waters contain nothing to distinguish them from a thousand others whose basis is steel with a certain mixture of salts and sulphur I know you will easilydispense  with a description of them Neither will I take up your time by a detail of the dinner or tea parties in the very wood I have now placed you These sort of accounts resemble the pictures which were censured for being though vastly pretty all alike Water drinking or dipping places have in themselves but one character and a description of any will like Mr Garrick's prologues serve as well for one place as another If you turn to any book of travels through any part of modern Europe for mineral or salt water to save trouble look in the index and take that which comes first to handno matter for the countryyou will have a description in point for what has been said and done on these occasions since waterdiving and drinking came into fashion the same talkings walkings intrigues divorces matches made and matches broken covert whispers and open scandals and all the old story of little and great conspiracies since the passions first came into public There is not left a remark  generally  speaking on these subjects worth a single wheatear So we will pass them by without gleaning just noting one or two  particular  habits of pleasure that obtain in the neighbourhood of the Cleves Wood  It is the practice for the Clevelanders to crowd on a fine Sunday to some very good teadrinking houses situate in the park to see tumbling boys and girls and dancing dogs and learned pigs and poultry The spectators place themselves in extensive alcoves open at both ends they almost all are to be seen in the  hottest weather  drinking the  hottest  tea with a dozen and often two dozen  redhot  teaurns under their very noses By way of auxiliary to this heat the men all smoke and take alternately a sup of tea a slice of bread or cake and a whiff of tobacco The married women snuff in proportion the spinsters born and educated amidst fire and smoke disperse the clouds with which their lovers and parents thus envelope them sighs of tenderness and whiffs of the best Virginia are puffed forth and mingle in the same breath and the young lady melts in the midst of them I do assure you a kitchen fire in the dogdays is "dewdropping coolness" to the being enclosed in this  long green oven  and what with the scalding water on the one hand and of the burning fires on the other a stranger finds himself almost suffocated The first time that I myself was stuck betwixt this Scylla and Charibdis I feelingly saw the force of custom which reconciled the most delicate young women for in point of form  and feature Westphalia has many such to boast to this hideous practice They seem as collected during this double attack as Generalissimos of an army in the heat of action After staying till I was almost boiled on one side and smokedried on the other I fought my escape in the wood the most beautiful paths of which as well public as private where nature breathed the sweetest air displayed the most enchanting pictures and sung the songs of gratitude and joy among her branches were comparatively deserted I am sorry to say that all the concerts societies clubs and other social meetings are deformed by those insufferable fumigations with which every house shop and even every garden is infested  It is thought to be salutary Had it been confined to Holland I might have possibly come into this notion as a corrector of bad air but when I found it laid all Germany in  smoke and ashes  and thereby spread over countries "where every breeze is health" I set it down as a vile custom that seeks to hide its filthiness in a weak apology  I cannot but reckon it lefs excuseable than the stoves amongst womena practice not less universal but which the dampness of the  air in the Provinces of Holland may render necessary It is attended also by worse consequences for there is nothing so rare amongst the Dutch Prussians or Germans as a good set of teeth and as boys accustom themselves to the use of a pipe almost as soon as they can fill hold and light it their teeth are discoloured at a time of life when the youth of other countries are alike pure in mind and person This defect is the more obvious in the German young men because the females of the same age are remarkable for exhibiting rows of that pearly whiteness which in Europe at least has been usually thought such a constituent in personal beauty The ladies however of Prussia and Germany being in the habit of seeing a couple of black ranges in the mouths of their lovers and husbands and to receive a whiff of smoke in their faces almost every time they associate or are spoken to by the opposite sex for immediately before and after and sometimes  at  meals they smoke do not seem to feel the contrast  I particularly remember to have been present at this very town of Cleves when amongst other company were two young people who had been given out as passionately fond of one another The lady was playing at her forte piano her lover holding a pipe in one of the  filthiest mouths I ever saw and accompanying her in a very pretty German air This air shewed the lady's fine rows of ivory to advantage while it exposed her Coridon's ebony no less to view and at the end of the song a sly and quiet Gleaner like myself could perceive that the company were so well pleased with the performers and the performers with  themselves  that not contented with the general acclamation of the friends they sealed the private applause they bestowed upon  one another  with so close an approach of faces that though their conscious satisfaction was not expressed and sealed in a kiss  heard  or hardly seen it certainly was in a kiss  felt  No one who had been a spectator of this scene would have agreed with the father of the fairfaced Desdemona in calling the love she manifested for the moor  unnatural  She had like the pretty Clevelander looked away the sable hue of Othello and since she could not find his mind in his visage discovered his visage in his mind Poetry and especially the poetry of Shakspeare which can do every thing can of course do this but nothing except that custom which the same immortal bard informs us  "Can make the flinty and steel couch of war  "A thricedrivenbed of down"  or what is yet even stronger than custom allcommanding love could make a junction of the whitest and blackest fairest and foulest teeth a matter of delight  Before I take you from this fair wood into the town of Cleves I must prepare you for a few other customs which you will meet with there and in other parts of the Duchy and indeed in most places of Germany  Expect in the first place to find the inhabitants here as in Holland too civil by half The courtesy of hatpulling prevails in Westphalia to a degree really painful It is a settled point for all natives to make bows to strangers of almost every description so that a traveller has little more to do in the considerable towns than to cover and uncover his head Indeed the hats themselves sufficiently shew the prevalence of the custom being all of them squeezed into a long roll as compact as a polonie on the takeoff side with the continual gripe of civility In one of my first excursions into this country I took part of a carriage with a young man just come from the Independent States of America and glowing with all the unrestrained spirit of his country His objections went to almost every thing he heard or  saw in monarchies they began with the head and descended to the feet for he neither endured the uncovering of the one nor the flexibility of the other I honour'd this ardour of his principles but wished to make them relax a little to the customs of a country I began with the affair of the hat which he swore should be inveterately fixed on his head in his passage through Holland adding that he looked upon obeisance to every body without distinction as a servility below the dignity of man's nature Let me advise you my friend and my readers to be courteous and to give into this somewhat fatiguing practise It will repay itself by many little urbanities you will wish for and find the Germans and Westphalians are an obliging race and their excess of hat civility is better than the contrary extreme But civility abroad is by no means confined to making you a passingbow and if it were it is a slight tax upon a traveller to endure and return it  I recollect being much pleased in Holland with a union of two things that rarely meet in any country During my Hague gleaning I was at the Playhouse when the beauty of two ladies both on travel excited the attention of the audience more than the performance But  the obscurity and gloom of the Hague theatre not clearly ascertaining that beauty a great number of the spectators were anxious to see more of the truth and accordingly had arranged themselves after the play in two mighty rows as if by common consent to see the fair strangers pass from their box to their carriage In itself this set and determined stare was certainly one of the rudenesses of curiosity but in order to smoothe away its rough edges the passing meteors no sooner appeared within the lines than as if by common consent also every hat was taken off and every head bowed respectfully to greet them Even if the curiosity which beauty very naturally excites did not carry in some degree its excuse along with it it would have been impossible for that beauty to have been offended In the present instance it produced just as it should do a blush of courtesy and consciousness as it passed along not resenting though not inviting the homage which it drew  Who is there my friend that ever has past b  a single winter in London but must have often seen the heroes of the boxlobby forming themselves into a phalanx hats on heads and opera glasses at eyes to stare out of countenance and out of the house perhaps amidst indecent  observations both beauty and innocence Let us not quarrel then with civilities that soften away our disgust nor even with public curiosity when it is tempered with public respect  Be prepared also for the  kissing  ceremony which you will find begin in Prussian Westphalia and extend over every part of the German territories Neither treat it with ridicule or disrespect for although it is the custom for both sexes to embrace and to present both sides of the face for salutation after passing only an hour together and though but next door neighbours it means no more than our exchanging the customary civilities of the moment  en passant  in our own country it signifies in short about as much as the mode of professing ourselves the obedient very humble servan  those indifferent people we meet with in  street or address by letter of business  ceremony  I must repeat that these national habits ought always to be complied with An obstinat  refusal in a young countryman of mine  accept of a salute was intended by him  express a scorn of the custom itself particularly in suffering his cheek to come into momentary  contact with that of a  man  but by the gentleman who offered the salute it was construed into his having a bad breath and a fear to discover it  Now as an imputation of this kind would be more wounding to the selflove of our petitmaitres and maitresses than perhaps an expulsion from kissing all the days of their lives I advise them to give and lend their cheeks for the kiss of custom without any farther hesitation  I feel it my duty likewise to prepare you for a little imposition in the hotels and private lodgings before you enter them as well as for the counterbalancing  agrémens  I must lay it down as a first general principle that a Prussian and German landlord if he possibly can will overreach you not so much I believe from dishonesty as from an almost  innate  idea of considering the word  Englishman  sinonimous with the word  riches  An Italian French and every other traveller even a Dutchman whom generally speaking they know is well able to pay up to any price demanded may always get accommodated at half price in comparison of the British wanderer that selfdevoted victim of vanity and folly Of this I will give you an instance not produced  in resentment for it was rather a subject of pleasantry but in order to put you your friends and every one into whose hands these Gleanings may fall on guard  On my first tour to Cleves I wished to make a stop of a few months and not readily suiting myself in an Hotel I sought private apartments A tradesman of whom I had bought some trifling articles and who spoke very good French offered to attend me to the house of a man who he said had rooms to lett and added that he would have the honour to be my interpreter  We went accordingly and I desired my Interpreter to ask the price of the Rooms when by way of answer came forth another question  Master of the House  The gentleman I suppose is French  Interpreter  No  Master of the House  Dutch  Interpreter  No English  This information consisting only of two monosyllables had the effect of a volume on the man's mind He intended however to be cautious and manage the intelligence but his features betrayed him  He  doubled  upon me every article as I shall presently shew I caused him to be informed that on the receipt of my next letters from England I should be able to decide whether I remained in the town or proceeded farther up the country observing that if I became his inmate it would be impossible to do without a slip of carpeting or some covering by the bed side  That may be had quoth the landlord and so we parted  The expected letters arrived and finding it convenient to pursue my route as far as Emeric on the other side of the Rhine I gave him notice two days earlier than my promise that as I should be absent a month or six weeks I would not hazard the letting his apartments to a more stationary tenant should any such offer Now that this notice might be formal it was translated and delivered by my interpreter Here I supposed we had done with one another but the next morning when every thing was ready for my departure the master of the inn where I had slept presented me with a reply to my billet written with a majesty of style that would have better suited the  Grand Frederic  who by the way would have given a much  more courteous answer than the little great man who was the author or rather dictator for he understood even less of the French than I of the German and was at the expence of a notary  Voilà le decret despotique de mon Maitre d'Hotel  But as all great events in which great personages are concerned are ushered in with due decorum I shall allot a separate gleaning to it  LETTER LXI TO THE SAME  PEUTETRE Monsieur que vous vous imaginez qu'il va ici comme en Angleterre  ou chaqu'un joue son rolle comme il veut  Non nous vivons sous le regne d'un tel Roi qui maintient son plus bas sujet ainsi aucun Anglois ne doit s'imaginer qu'il peut exercer le Rolle de l'Angleterre aux états Prussiens Je ne vous ai pas appellé vous etes venu de vous même aupres moi et vous avez loué les chambres et parceque vous l'avez desiré que je mettrois des tappis sur les planches je les ai acheté le lit demonté est remonté et puisque vous avez voulu deja occuper Dimanche les chambres je me suis  forte derangé à mes affaires pour les arranger Pour toutecela jepretend d'être dedommagé puisque vous n'avez pas envie de les occuper et je vous demande par celle ci ou  vous avez envie de payer le loué pour trois mois ou non  Si non alors je chercherai mon droit à la justice  MITSDORFFER  Cleves  ce    Mars  As a Prussian curiosity you will accept a literal translation of it courteous reader if peradventure thou art not sufficiently in practice with the French language to feel the might and majesty of the sentiments You I know my dear friend can relish them in all their original bombast  TRANSLATION  Perhaps Sir you imagine you may act here as you do in England where every one does just as he pleases No We live under the government of a king  Such a King  who supports the rights of his meanest subjects And whosoever dares to suppose he may play the game he does in Great Britain within the territory of his Prussian majesty will find himself mistaken It was not at my invitation you came to my house it was an act of  your own free will and you have hired my chambers You desired I would cover the boards with a carpet a carpet I have bought and the boards are covered My bed too has been taken down in one place and put up in another to please you and I am thereby disarranged For all this I expect to have my damages made good and as you do not choose to occupy the lodgings I desire to know whether you choose to pay for them I speak of the three months for which they are let to you If yes well if no I shall seek my right from the laws of the land whereof I have the honour to be a member  BooooThere's for you Was ever the Pope's bull fulminated with more vengeance  "Myn Heer said my landlord had better postpone his journey till this little ugly affair is settled for there is no answering to the lengths this hotheaded man may go and to be stopped on the road by the officers of justice would be disagreeable Officers of justice officers of nonsense said I I sent for my interpreter who though a native of the place did not by good luck take the part of his townsman On the contrary he accompanied me swearing all  the way in High Dutch never to have made any mention of three months nor any contract whatsoever He increased his pace in proportion as he increased his oaths and these running affidavits presently brought us to the scene of action The landlord was in the very chamber in dispute which we found sure enough sufficiently deranged Had a score of swine herded in them they could not have been in a more filthy situation Neither curtains nor mat nor carpet nor any furniture but that of which I had at first complained The fury of the interpreter was equal to the dismay of the Prussian dictator Our visit to the latter was so unexpected and our detection of him so unequivocal that he could not reply to the denunciations of my linguist who pursuing his advantages laid about him like a Drawcansir The host at last felt himself galled and ventured the retort  uncourteous  this produced a rejoinder that again a replication which ran through the whole vocabulary of angry eloquence in the heat of which I left the combatants and with great coolness departed for Emeric but on passing Cleves some months after I fell in company with the very gentleman who occupied these memorable apartments for the use of which his board inclusive he paid to a stiver  per month  what had  been demanded of me  per week  but then he was a Prussian and Ian Englishman  I cannot write this latter name without an almost equal mixture of pride and indignation pleasure and regret I grieve that it is rendered less respectable abroad than at home and that by the purseproud vanity or dissipated pageantry of individuals the character of an whole nation suffers More than once in the course of these Gleanings have I been forced upon this unwelcome subject and I must now take it up again because I can no other way my loved friend account to you or to the public for a multitude of impositions which lie in reserve which are absolutely in  waiting  for my countrymen the moment they have crossed the Channel and which like costly and troublesome companions fasten themselves to his pursestrings till they "leave not a rack behind" For all which I am sorry to say  Englishmen  have nobody to blame but themselves  In the first place they take over with them English ideas of expence into other countries  Secondly They take over also a large cargo of national pride wishing to spread the general  received notion of English wealth being greater than that of other countries  Thirdly They are in a habit of prodigality at home which is too inveterate in waste to make economical retrenchments abroad and even if they set out on a saving principle they soon glide into the extravagant passion  Now from a cooperation of all these it is really wonderful to consider how wide the mischief is disfused A Swiss officer and Prussian gentleman counciled me to let a friend of theirs make my bargains and purchases as we were to travel some time in company and make stops at the same places I yielded to this good advice but counteracted its effect by being his associate It was found out by some means or another that I was an Englishman and that was more than enough The personswhether Dutch Prussians or Germansmean not to overreach you They intend only to ask up to the character our countrymen have established for riches They even design sometimes an extortion as a compliment because it presupposes the preeminent wealth of our nation They argue too that while you come so many hundred or thousand leagues from home it is not possible you should  want money since if you did you would naturally stay at home  Thus a foolish ambition of keeping up a false reputation begins on the other side of the water and travels with you to the end both of water and land Taking London as the center it has gone in as many directions as there are great post roads even to the once cheap parts of the British empire Yorkshire Scotland and Wales In every inch of these you feel the heavy hand of an English traveller's profusion forced into your pocket Those necessaries of life which thirty years back might be comfortably procured for the third of their present purchase at an English market soon mounted to the half then they rose to three parts and now unless you enter into engagements very advisedly the difference of English expenditure will scarcely warrant the charge of taking so long a journey Shall I be answered that the difference in these gradations arises from the difference of the times refinements luxuries c Certainly these increase the evil but even at this day as I stated to you in a former letter the great articles of life are to be had at more than an half in half average with the English market It will assuredly be granted that fish  flesh fowl eggs butter and houserent are the  chief  of those articles and all these are to be had as I have before described The fair inference is that where taxation or refinement have levied one impost national pride and habitual folly have levied twenty The natives themselves both in the above countries and in those more remote have candour enough to acknowledge this but  now  the habit of charge is as strong as the profusion by which it was at first created and the simplicity and oeconomy of a place once destroyed like a wounded character never recovers itself On the contrary extortion and extravagance erect a sort of temple to Folly on their ruins and an imposition  taught to others by ourselves  becomes the custom of a country till in the end foreigners think they have a presumptive right to cheat you The same spirit that induces us to spoil the places nearer home enables us to ruin our residences and accommodations abroad Our profusion traverses the whole continent of Europe the Alps and Pyrennees sink before it and wherever as in Westphalia from the natural abundance of a country or the want of traffic or distance from a public mart the necessaries of life are  still  to be got at half price they would I am convinced  have remained at a third less than at present had it not been for English profusion English pride and English prejudice  Under these comfortless prospects of being imposed upon by our own countrymen's folly even when  out  of Englandfor I insist on it they are the aggressorsI do not think I can render to my countrymen at this distance from themor to you my friend whom I suppose to be so near a greater servicethan to note the actual rates of living and the comparative dearness or cheapness of the several countries in which I have resided This is certainly another very humble office but a no less useful one and either on account of its humility or utility has been strangely misrepresented or overlooked  Once more making England a centrical point of travelling the expenditure will be found to ascend in a series as you pass along  i e  the farther removed from the center the less you spendsupposing a less influence from examples of English extravagance  The difference of charge even to perfect strangersand making allowances for a  predetermination  almost every where to overreach  you to the verge of the laws of the landis almost incredible What English travelling at  home  comes to I need not state either in lodgings at inns or on the road Houseing you safe on this side of the water you immediately would perceive the difference were you disposed to begin your estimate for although you may be chagrined at the necessity of keeping your purse in the hand in your tour through Holland were you to separate one charge from another you would even admitting some extortion find the balance in favour of Dutch imposition No my friend thrown without the arms of language acquaintance or experience of customs on the mercy of the Hollanders you would last longer that is you would be less  speedily  devoured by the Dutch than by your own countrymen under like circumstances But though your devoration would be more  slow  it would not be less  sure i e  were you not to buy and dearly buy knowledge as you go on and had you no honest and diligent wayfaring traveller to glean the paths before you  Leaving you however as just observed undefended amongst the Hollanders you would not so soon be swallowed up as by the English The difference of charges is remarkable  in going only from one province to another and when you have left the Dutch boundaries and gained the Prussian dominions you perceive the cheating of one country so much more endurable than that of another that in this instance at least whatever may be your political principles you would prefer the despotic States to the Republicsand exclaim with poor Lear  "The wicked compared with the more wicked  "Seem beautiful and not to be the worst  "Stands in some rank of praise"  I believe I have used this quotation in some former letter but it becomes apposite again and you will excuse repetition  How  well it applies at present you shall immediately judge At the best inn of Cleves my charge for twelve days was little more than a guinea sterling and for which I was accommodated with a very good bedroom the use of the general sittingroom and an excellent table adorned with the best company as well residents as travellers At one of the largest inns of the Hague it cost me precisely that sum a guinea for  one day's  worse living worse lodging and worse attendance Having mentioned to you the name of the more reasonable Hague landlord I trust your faith in my account will  lead you to choose the good and to avoid the bad and therefore it becomes unnecessary to specify the person by whom I was thus overcharged But justice requires I should tell you and the world that the name of the Cleves landlord is Nysa  To prevent the trouble of enquiry and the vexation of being reduced to contests at a place of public accommodation I will take this opportunity to set down the sixed prices of all the most reputable table d'hotes public eatinghouses and hotels in the provinces of Holland and in Prussian Westphalia  HOLLAND     Florins  Stivers  Doits  Breakfast        Dinner        Bottle of Rhine or Bourdeaux wine        Bed        Fire if in your own room per day        WESTPHALIA     Florins  Stivers  Doits  Breakfast        Bed fire included        Dinner        Bottle of wine        In Holland the train of waiters shoeboys c are at the heels of your bill and interrupt though not with equal boldness of  authority  your way to the horse or carriage In Westphalia these supernumeraries are all paid by their master and included in their wages The above statement then will serve you through both countries from Helveotsluice or the Hague to the farthest end of the Prussian States and the variations are unimportant in your route to Berlin on the one hand and to Vienna on the other  It should be noted that the money of Holland is nominally double that of Prussia I say nominally because in the  exchange  it makes little to a traveller's advantage but in purchase of the articles of life it is half in half Indeed the coin more especially the silver is of so base materials that the circulation is almost wholly confined to Prussia It is refused currency even on the frontiers of Holland The Cleves money will not pass even at Nimeguen where there is a constant reciprocal communication  It will be proper to mention to you the names and valuation of the Cleves and Prussian  coins  I shall here however make a general observation on the subject of the coins of Prussia and Germany The natives I mean thereby the common tradesmen who are ever upon the watch for strangers admit that the Dutch money is in effect double the value of theirs such for instance as that forty stivers Prussia are given for twenty Holland but that it is fair to charge four stivers for a commodity which may be had in Holland for two a piece of logic which they justify on the ground of your ignorance being greater than their cunning Luckily however the price of public boats and public carriages are settled by ordinance though even this is liable to abuse and the Seller sometimes passes a cheat on the Buyer under the pretended sanction of Government I had occasion to stop at an inn of Maiseland Sluice in Holland with a good deal of baggage and I also took my dinner or rather luncheon being too late for one barge and too soon for another When I came to pay the bill I found so many extra charges that I resisted payment till I had asked a few questions  Gleaner  What is the meaning of this charge  HotelKeeper  'Tis by order of the StatesGeneral  Gleaner  And this  HotelKeeper  The ordinance is also by the StatesGeneral  Gleaner  And this  HotelKeeper  Is settled by the StatesGeneral  Gleaner  I can only say then that the StatesGeneral are aiders and abetters if not principals in the most enormous plunder upon a stranger's property of any people on earth  To this remark the Hotelkeeper smil'd assent but plunder'd on I complained of several particulars to the Commissary of the Town who redressed both my wrongs and those of the Republic by assuring me every iota was imposition for which he sentenced the Landlord to deductions on almost every article and attended me in person to see justice duly administered I certainly enjoyed not a little the confusion of the extortioner and was malicious enough to remind him at every refund that he paid me back the extorted money  by order of the States General  that you may be prepared and compare them with those of Holland They shall be  given in the supplementary pages of this closing sheaf where a number of pickingsup shall be thrown into one or two general letters properly speaking a letter of scraps on different subjects gathered in different countries valuable perhaps when made into a collection but too minute to stand alone I have many of these lieing in slips of paper on the backs or edges of letters in my drawer of memorandas which I fill as I empty my pockets after a walk a ride a visit c c and I shall set apart a stayathomeday to arrange and transmit them Meantime we are just now too much in the heat of business in Gleaning the things of the  first necessity  alas poor dear human nature of what eating and drinking and other frail materials art thou compounded to amuse ourselves with affairs less solid If a traveller wishes to become residentiary for a few weeks or months in any of the pleasant German towns and brings with him his family the best way is to make an agreement with a traiteur a  cook and live with him if as is often the case he happens to have a good house This besides the accommodation of having your repast comfortable and warm is cheaper by nearly half as it  includes  the price of a room I know a gentleman who says he is well served with breakfasts and dinners suppers are rarely taken abroad and two good chambers for twentyone florins about one guinea at par per month in a very popular part of Prussian Westphalia But even if you take private lodgings and are only supplied from a traiteur's with eatables you gain importantly on Englandas thus  Dinners  which imply a sufficiency for suppers as you always are entitled to keep what is sent you are twelve Holland stivers aheadabout a shilling English It is called one portion it consists of four covered dishes which with bread cheese butter and sallads that are always found by yourself contain enough for two meals as two portions do for four  I was present at a bargain of this kind being made at Cleves with one of the many publick cooks of that place he was on the edge of becoming a victim to his ignorance in these matters when an honest Prussian who was present with a friendly presence of mind  observed to the cook"Certainement Monsieur est un peu Catholique il ne mange pas de viande  tous les jours  I took the hint and told the man that when I wanted a double portion he should know it in time to make the necessary addition This reduced the monthly charge which had previously been made to about one pound fifteen shillings  Let me not fail to apprize you moreover that the buying your wine of a merchant and of an hotelkeeper or cook is on an average difference of more than half in half in Holland Prussia and Germany  At the inns of Holland you will pay for tablewine one florin ten stivers half a crown at those of Prussia and Germany from sixteen stivers to one florin and at the merchants of the first country for the same wine eight stivers and in the two other countries so low as six stivers or seven at most and let it not be forgotten that the eight penny wine is precisely the same as to quality for which with duties on foreign spirits you pay in England from five to seven shillings a bottle  There are certain articles so incredibly cheap even in these times of general scarcity  every  where  that I want almost confidence in my own conviction or in my trust of your candour to make just report of them In various provincial towns both in the neighbourhood of the Upper and Lower Rhine the best butter is sold in the month of May at twopence per pound a very fine young fowl at four and five pence a duck the same butcher's meat at twopence and twopence halfpenny a full grown hare at eight nine or tenpence sometimes at still less a goose or turkey at tenpence when at the dearest and the finest Westphalia ham from threepence to fourpence per pound Houserent is in proportion I leave you therefore to judge how comfortable a family pinched for necessaries and perhaps struggling betwixt the extremes of pride and poverty in England may live in the German territories And yet I still cannot help giving Wales the preference for two reasonsfirst because it is nearly as cheap and in a part of my own country and does not take money out of the British dominions and secondly because it contains more general beauty than any thing to be met with without taking a long journey which with a family is in itself the expenditure of more than could be expected from a twelvemonth's savings As the retreat of an unconnected person or of a  family resolved to establish in a new country and as Dr Young says  fixing would be fixed  it would be really a saving without abridgement of comforts and even luxuries of thirty or forty per cent Eggs are frequently fifteen for twopence and seldom less than ten and firing is proportionably cheap Bread however is nearly the same price as in England I mean such as is made from the white flour but they grow an inferior kind considerably darker when baked than our farmhouse loaves which is eaten with a farmhouse appetite not only by the peasantry but most other people By way of qualifying its bitter and sour taste the better sorts of folks place their butter betwixt a slice of the black and a slice of the white bread and when they wish to luxuriate as on a dainty or to distinguish their hospitality to a friend a two penny loaf of the entire white is brought forth and cut into as many morsels as there are persons to be regaled  It will seem incredible to an English reader whatever be his situation to be told that a German bill of fare consists of little more than what is appointed for a meagre day rigidly maintained insomuch that the Westphalians Prussians and Germans in general may be duly and truly said to keep Lent all the year  I am authorised by truth to assure you from long experience of their table that the yearly expenditure of a large family in any of the abovenamed countries would scarce exceed if it could reach that of an English farmer's household consisting of an equal number of people for a single month An enormous dish of potatoes cabbages carrots beans and other vegetables forms the basis of their dinner which with all ranks is taken at twelve o'clock It is a very great luxury when half a pound of pork bacon or butcher's meat is stuck in the midst of this medley as the grand center of attraction and yet this precious morsel is rather for ornament than use rather to be admired and gazed on like other forbidden fruit than eaten A variety of trifles from the garden forms the desert which is rather tasted than enjoyed if there happens to be any thing more  recherché  more valuable than a nut or an apple and a small platefull even of these become so "familiar to the eye" that they pall upon the sense before you are presented with a fresh supply I protest to you that I was so accustomed to look on a fruit plate and its contents for such a length of time at a table in Westphalia that I knew every speck and freckle about them as well as the faces of the family Indeed I had opportunities  to see them so constantly and closely that each apple and pear became a  memento mori to the family  In the beginning of the week they came fresh from the tree with their best look and blooming complexions A very few of them alas were cut off in this the prime of their lives The rest were brought on the second day not much altered in their shapes or air On the third there was a visible alterationnevertheless the young folks of the family for there were many children  "Sigh'd and look'd sigh'd and look'd  "Sigh'd and look'd and sigh'd again"  but alas sigh'd and look'd look'd and sigh'd sigh'd and long'd in vain It was written in the father's faceye may not eat while the indulgent matron cut one into as many quarters as she had sons and daughters and the next day the father being in a frolicsome humour threw an apple and a pear after dinner amongst them on the floor where they were as much fought for as Joseph's coat and produced as much shame to the vanquished and triumph to the conquerors as if they were heroes and kings battling it away for thrones and dominions perhaps on the true estimate as little worthy of contest Towards the end of the week my old friends in the fruitplate  began to drop off one by one and though it is amongst my habits never to eat of those things which the master of the house discovers to me by his manner he considers as a rarity in compassion to these poor things I took off their dusty coats and thereby prevented a more lingering death  Some weeks after I dined at the same gentleman's house and though to be sure a man would not choose to swear to an apple I could all but make oath that I observed amongst the reenforcements of the well remembered fruitplate one pippen which was so palpable by his marks that I recognised him as an old acquaintance the moment he came in my view now be it known to you this was by no means in the season of the year when apples are laid up like honey in the hive for winter provision but when they would in England have come fresh from the tree at every meal It is strict economy that urges this extreme forbearance in almost every thing that regards in short that either smells or tastes like a luxury And it is imposed by a very stern necessity for Germany and poverty are almost synonimous terms and though in particular instances such a thing as wealth is to be found  the general run of people in all conditions are reduced to observe a most scrupulous frugality in all things their income being usually such as to inhibit the least article of profusion  Nor is this oeconomy confined to the appetites it extends to the ornaments of life I had almost said to its vanities but it may be done in effect to promote these You shall decide on this after I have informed you it is the universal practise to undress after a visit A lady or gentleman no sooner returns home than they lay aside their costly robes and get into their slippers nightgowns yea and nightcaps also And appear extremely surprised to learn it is a general custom in England to keep on their out of door dresses as they are called in Germany when they are amongst family friends nor could I easily reconcile them to my following the custom of my country in this particular till I had assured them changing my dress frequently gave me cold They call this stripping practice putting themselves at their ease but it is in truth purely done for oeconomy  Frugality is an early part of education in these countries insomuch that it is common to  observe a wellbred young lady in some of the best families wash up the teathings immediately after they are done with and in the midst of the company who have been using them At first I supposed this was a menial office imposed by a cross papa or overmanaging mamma but when I became a residentiary gleaner I saw it so much the fashion of every family that I inform you of it as a general rule not only in Germany but in Holland also  The natives of these places not only eat sparingly as having little to eat but they eat seldomand drink as often as they can The custom of slight breakfasts vegetable or rather hodgepodge dinners and yet slighter frequently no suppers has its beginning in Holland travels to Westphalia like a slender current narrowing as it goes with respect to quantum and is at its perfection of oeconomy in the empire The only thing in which they yield to profusion at their own expence is in the article of tea and coffee this they take almost every hour but  without sugar  The women snuff and the men smoke over it But they usually drink it out of cups that scarce hold so much as an acorn and though from the quantity taken this custom gives perpetual  trouble they still prefer these diminutive machines which would scarce serve a fairy to sip dew drops To think of a wide Dutch mouth screwed up to the dimensions of such a sprite  It is I find very true that the English are every where looked on to be exceedingly carnivorous and it is true also that an Englishman will devour more solid flesh in a day and pour down his throat more inflammatory liquid than a Prussian German or Dutchman in  three  days An English traveller however soon assimilates to the general temperance of the country the consequence of which is that instead of wasting an whole afternoon in an hot room amidst the fumes of the table or sleeping to relieve an overloaded stomach he feels alert either for business or pleasure and seems to wonder at this change of himself  I have just mentioned to you the early dinners on this part of the Continent but forgot to note to you that the reason assigned for it is exactly the reverse of what is given out for a four or five o'clock repast in Great Britain We eat at midday says the foreigner that we may have a long afternoon We eat in the evening says the Englishman that we may  have a long morning The customs of a country ought certainly to give and receive allowances but I have found this difference in the hours productive of great difficulties between some of my countrymen and foreigners the first insisting that as twelve o'clock was too late for breakfast and too soon for dinner it could be considered only as the hour proper for a luncheon and the other declaring that sitting down to table at such an unseasonable time was insupportable for my own part I am blest with so social an appetite that it seems made for a ready compliance with the customs of all countries Is it the fashion of the family to eat at noon I sit down and forget that I had not been used to think about dinner till nearer night Does my meal make its appearance with the candles Be it so I eat heartily if I am well and if I am sick I play with my knife and fork to keep those who are better company Now this versatility in my disposition leads me into many pleasures and contentments which less accommodating tempers can never hope to enjoy It is peculiarly estimable in travelling for can it be reasonably expected that without being well paid for it people will come into the customs of a stranger and forego their own Will you tell them it is  polite  to go to dinner when they are going to supper Or  as an individual are you to derange a family who in turn could tell you that the politeness of their country settles these matters on very different principles Who is to adjust this knotty point You fall out with your dinner and with each other How easily would a little candour and courtesy place it just where it should beO good humour thou least difficult yet brightest of the social virtuesthou creator and supporter of every otherwhere is the land the habit the manners which are not reconciled to the heart by thy assuasive and smiling power Inspired by thee I feel myself disposed to be happy and I am so to impart it to all with whom I mix in this now jarring world and I succeedAnd did the fond parent know thy value as I know it he would pray that his darling child was rather filled with thee than favoured by beauty genius or fortune for what are these but the miserable children of conceit pride and folly unprotected and uninspired by thee  From what has been said on the very necessary though very much neglected subject of eating and drinking it will I trust appear manifest that if a traveller will be content to buy a little experience which is no where to be had without paying for and if he will  not be too much in a hurry to make his arrangements and while they are adjusting indulge his heart in a few effusions of that goodhumour I have been addressing he may be very comfortable to himself and no less acceptable to others but if he will be stubborn and inflexibly attached to his own opinions manners and customs and not come into those of other people in other countries he has nothing to do but to live by himself according to his fancy andpay accordingly  But I forget that all this time while I have been discussing the subjects of the table I have seated you in the Cleves Wood and left you in a worse situation even than the Germans without any dinner at all Rise then my friend and that you may no longer want an opportunity I put an end to my letter with the usual assurances of being affectionately your's  LETTER LXII TO THE SAME  TAKING it for granted that you will feel yourself refreshed before you sit down to the perusal of another letter and that all  those who may become its readers will bring along with them good spirits and  goodnature  I will invite your attention to some further Gleanings on the circle of Westphalia  You are not now to learn that Prussia is a Catholic country where however Protestantism in the Presbyterian form is largely interspersed The churches are every where the objects that first catch the eyes of travellers for which reason I suppose it is that you meet so many steeples and towers monuments and escutcheons in almost every book of modern travels  Catholic churches in particular as being more ornamental have been so often described by  publishing  travellers that they are perhaps the only objects in the wide field of foreign observation which have been measured with an accuracy that leaves nothing for the gleaner Open the books of these authors at whatever page you may and it is odds but you see half a dozen spires followed by a long history of their founders destroyers rebuilders redestroyers revolutions  c  Two churches and a castle to a leaf is moderate reckoning and it is well if you get off without a morsel of choice biography on the quarrels and rogueries virtues  and vices of the prince bishops beggarly priests or despotic lords of the castle for the Cacoethes  De  scribendi if I may be allowed to sport with the Latinity is as strong in some wandering biographers as in juvenile poets when first they fancy themselves in love and present you with that picture of their idols which imagination has drawn for them For myself and I suppose others may feel like me on the occasion I never without trembling observe a travelled author  set in  for a long story of churches chapels chateaus and picture galleries with a determination to give their "moving accidents" by flood and fire during the wear and tear and traditionary lying of half a score centuries And what after all are you presented with but a meagre account into which the mind and memory of the reader vainly look for something whereon to restsomething more worthy the human faculties than annals of the intriguing abbots mischievous priests and grinding seigniors buried under their ruins I venerate antiquity but must have something that comes closer to the soul the understanding or the affections than this collection of literary brickwork and travelling stone masonry Peace to the ashes of the mouldering universe Unless surviving virtues or immortal actions lie amongst the  ruins and like the phoenix only want an honest helping hand to clear away the earthy obstructions to spring above them I would not rescue an altar or the canonized bones of a Saint from oblivion Unembalmed by such virtues and such actions the dust of a monarch and the dust of the earth that covers him is to me exactly the same thing and as to the relicks of a worthless being to what good end could they be brought from the tomb but as a  maukin  to shew the villains of the present generation that to such complexion must they come at lastIn that light only have I sometimes as in the instance of a John of Leyden burst the searments of the grave and gleaned the coffin of a scoundrel  Respecting church matters therefore I shall certainly not swell the list of historians but after I have made one general observation shall content myself with the relation of a single circumstance  It is really a most heartaffecting satisfaction in a circuit of some hundreds of leagues such as I have taken over different Catholic countries to see the decent impression that is made on the  peasantry  which is ever the most numerous body of a state by religion Of the  higher ranks who lose their principles and their education too often in the pride of philosophy I shall here say nothing but the influence of the Catholic faith on the  subordinate  ranks is almost without an exception a sober and sincere attention to the duties it enjoins The earnest yet tempered zeal with which the common labourer leaves his business or his pleasure to commune with his Maker is amongst the comfortable sights that every traveller must surely have noticed and noticing must have enjoyed In the plebeian part of the community at least it must be genuine The infidel philosophy of the great is happily above their reach the hypocritical mummery or profounder chicane of the yet perhaps more infidel priesthood I speak of the Catholic churchmen is still more happily above the understanding of the peasant He can have no views from interest from the world's applause or from the world's disapprobation His religion after education has settled it in his mind becomes one of the strongest habits it soon ripens into his most powerful principles It is presently a voluntary offering and one of perfect free will to his God He accepts its pains and penalties and never resists their infliction He is told by his confessor of a sin and he suffers for it willingly Neither does  he perform its duties so mechanically as may be supposedHe goes to the church at all times and seasons the gates of the temple are always open but he is not forced to enter at the stated stroke of the pendulum or chime of the bell If his soul feels not the impulse if it prefers the sacred moment when the hour of public worship is past he can withdraw himself from the gaze of the world and converse as it were with his Creator face to face and in the Catholic churches which I have  gleaned  even with a suspicious vigilance this is very frequently done and always with reverence Strangers drawn by curiosity only may pass in groupes from all quarters of the earth and dressed in all the different habits of their country without seducing the kneeling Catholic peasant from his duty his posture is unaltered his prayer unbroken He rarely lends an ear to conversation which is too often irreverently loud and not often an eye to their persons  From this exterior decency it is fair to infer an internal piety It is to be sure a world replete with subtle stratagem and false appearances but if ever there can be supposed to be a principle "unmixed with baser matter" this surely is the most free from alloy And if  one could select from the mass of enormities which the present governors of France have committed and single out an act more foul more cruel than the rest I should not hesitate to pronounce their attempt to convert the simple heart to EQUALITY of  Atheism  The Augean stable of the Catholic church so far as it was connected with politics no doubt wanted cleansing and possibly some of its most aspiring heads well deserved  Le Glaive de la Loi  the sword of justice but to my feelings and it has arisen out of my observation better far better had the convent and the cloister been polluted by the whole chicane of the priesthood than that so many hundreds of thousands of blameless beings should not only want in future the comfort of a refuge in misery and of a guide in happiness but should be taught that the benefits and blessings of the  past  derived from this sacred source were the trick of a designing race and that for the time to come the laws of reason and nature that is infidelity and licentiousness are to supersede those of a Saviour and Redeemer of the world Then by way of proving their proselytism and faith in the new creed they are instead of bowing the knee to the cross they are to turn from it in mockery like the revilers  of old or to level it with the dust Glorious revolution and more glorious revolutionists To lay the foundations of a republic in human blood and erect a temple to infidelity on the ruins of religion In the ancient fabric were there defects Why not repair them Must it fall that a worse may be raisedbut I forget myselfa scourge was wanted in the land and ye were perhaps the proper instruments to deal destructions for who can punish iniquity like the wicked  But I promised you to close with the relation of a circumstance which I owe to the Catholic church Half an hour's walking by the side of the Cleves wood brings you to a little village chapel whose bell was ringing out for evening vespers just as I paid it my first visit Only a few of the congregation were then gather'd together I had therefore time to make an unobtrusive Gleaning Amongst the usual decorations of pictures paintings flowers and crucifixes I could not but take notice of the virgin in a chintzpattern linen gown over a full dress hoop of immense circumference ornamented with three distinct rows of silver crosses the middle row abundantly the largest the crown upon her head was formed of broken beads and pieces of  lookingglass the child Jesus held an apple in his hand partly eaten to express what Eve had fraudulently accepted and shared with the devil  I might have yielded up my gravity at the burlesque manner in which this part of sacred story was caricatured had not the ridicule it was so well calculated to excite been checked by my observing an old man and woman two young men and two female children kneeling with every mark of devotion round the figures They are of one house said a person who stood near me and in the sequel I found that that house had to boast an holy family The very moment that I looked upon them the spirit of mockery died within me and a much better spirit came upon me in its stead I had no longer eyes to criticise the figures nor an heart to break a jest on their absurdity As representatives of the blessed virgin and Redeemer of the world they fill'd me with awe and I caught so much of unaffected holiness from these humble suppliants as to hold sacred the coarsest imitations and symbols of things divine  It happened to be the  jour de pâcque  on the evening of which festival there prevails in  Westphalia a custom that I felt was worth gleaning for you and for the public You shall have it here The Prussian peasants commemorate the solemn event of our Saviour's resurrection in a singular manner In each village of the circle are to be seen three or four large bonfires which the inhabitants have been preparing at their intervals of daily labour during the preceding week The fires are lighted about nine at night about ten when they are in full blaze the populace and indeed people of all distinctions go out of the Cleves gates to view them I was lucky enough at the moment to be on a visit to a gentleman who at a small distance from the western Port had a summer house that commanded the country to the extent of twenty leagues Every quarter or half league has a village and the whole twenty leagues were illuminated It was in itself an interesting novelty but when the  occasion  was contemplated and combined with it the heart glow'd like the horizon In the midst of the scenery rose the moon She was at full but at the moment of rising seem'd another bonfire beginning to kindle and ascend She soon however asserted her superiority and when she had gain'd her proper station in the hemisphere I could not help repeating to myself a  few words applicable to both"Hide your diminish'd heads" ye feeble works of men's hands but thou Cynthia art of God No wonder then at thy lustre but even as I pronounced this I corrected my rashness my injusticeand so are  ye  ye feeble firesadded Iof God also and every humble spark shall ascend to heaven  LETTER LXIII TO THE SAME  I HAVE already more than once in the course of this correspondence attempted to check the heady current of national prejudice which appropriates all that is estimable in human nature to itself and leaves to the rest of the world only its vices vanities and insignificancies I have given many examples of urbanity that have been the growth of soils less celebrated than that of Britain or than what once was France I have shewn it flourishing even in the unwholesome clime of Holland Let me now offer you an instance of its blooming power in Westphalia In truth it is a flower appropriate to no particular country but will prosper wherever it is duly  cultivated Its natural soil is the human heart in which it springs up and thrives very soon after that heart begins to beat and would continue till there is no longer motion were not passions and prejudices for ever at work to check its growth or kill it in the hud  In one of the most profound recesses of this beautiful country at the distance of at least forty leagues from a court thirty from a city and at least ten miles from a market town I once found urbanity that would have given lustre to them all I found her in a cottage of clay at the foot of a Prussian forest under covert of which I was shaded from observation It was on one of the most lovely evenings a wanderer like myself could have defir'd and according to my emigrant disposition I had enjoyed it from the uprise even to the downgoing of the sun The sun indeed of that distinguish'd day was making a "golden set" just as I reach'd the precincts of the wood where I had not repos'd many minutes ere I heard the sound of a flute accompanied by a voice whose natural sweetness excelled it in melody The notes were indeed assisted by many harmonizing circumstances You who are a lover of nature know what a  variety of soothing sounds pervade the air at eventide in the summerThe pure breath of the zephir the distant rivulet that seems by its indolent lapse and subdued murmur to partake of human sensationsthe drowsy hum of the beetle which the poet has immortaliz'd and the general sighing of the leaves with perhaps the horn of the herdboy and the lowing of his cattle obedient to his summonsand above all those founds which imagination herself  creates  all these contribute to form that twilight enchantment which a tender heart and a benevolent disposition so much delights in and which men of the world consider as the daydreams of madmen  Had I time to spare from my cottagers it would be amusing to run at some length the parallel betwixt a lover of nature and a man of the world and to examine the estimate that each makes of the objects assembled in the last passage To attempt this in abridgement  st The man of the world would never be tempted to leave the "chearful haunts of men" without what is called a jolly party five out of the six of which probably wishing  themselves as many different ways before half the day is over and at last going yawning home thoroughly tired with if not hating one another for I have so often observ'd a party of pleasure to be so painful a plot upon the members that compose it that were I to compile a new Dictionary in which definitions were honestly to be given I should under the words  party of pleasure  inform the reader that it is meant to signify  the association of a set of persons met together with tastes and tempers frequently discordant and interests in opposition yet determined to congregate for the purpose of teasing one another under the mask of social goodfellowship which mask generally drops or is torn off in the course of a few hours to the discovery of the whole conspiracy  Such is the mere man of the world's party of pleasure yes and woman's of the world also  nd A man of the world has no conception of the breath or sounds  of  or  in  the air in the way that a lover of nature feels and enjoys them A man of the world indeed observes that it is cursed hot and throws up the sashes or cursed cold and pulls down the blindsthe inflammatory bottles ten times more burning than the sunbeams are still on the tableyet at the fashionable hour he  goes forthwhereTo the  public  walks For what purposeTo see the  public  But goes he not into the beautiful woodsYes into the  public  parts of them where he has a chance to see the world he loves so well And is he never led by his fancy or his feelings into the sequester'd parts where nature modestly and humbly displays her genius and graces No my friend ladies and gentlemen of the world usually avoid these byeroad beauties unless carried thither by some passion that shuns the dayAnd as to claybuilt cottages woodland inhabitants rustic songs and lazy waterfalls they are pass'd by as fit only for country Corydons or shepherdesses bemus'd Far different is the attractive scenery of a world's man and womanthe broad and beaten track amidst the crush and clatter of coaches which are so wedg'd together that they move as if in funeral processionwalks so cramm'd that you cannot pass without difficultya cluster of glaring lamps stuck upon trees to the blush of the moon beamthe sun himself shut out to make way for a parcel of artificial lights brought into an unwholesome room crouded with company and card tablesa kind of elegant pesthouse where people infect one another by common consent and are suffocated  on principles of politenessThese are the appreciated scenes of men and women of the worldAnd I ought not to sail observing that amongst these wellbred broil'd and roasted who sit with the perseverance of an hatching hen as if nail'd to the sides of the card tablethere are always a certain number of sentimental misses who affect to have souls superior to such waste of time and build up a sort of reputation on never touching a card but when politeness or a dowager mamma insists on her making up the setThese damsels fidget or glide about the rooms and ogle their fair images in the pier glasses till pick'd up by stray batchelors or cut out married men or songtranscribing young striplings who get into prattling parties or file off into corners ser a touch of the patheticks or construct the horn work of a future fiege in a whisper'd tête a tête Most of these light troops assure you of their detestation of the town but yet run their pretty faces into one or other of its hothouses every night and go through a summer campaign amidst more fire and smoke than would melt down the constitution of the whole body of aldermen Mean time there is another set dispers'd here and there insidiously laying a mine to blow up reputations and while the game of  the other parties goes on these engineers prepare a very notable masked battery and play off their artillery as if only in a mock action at your wife or daughter till they almost surrender at discretion before your face The play amongst the card veterans becomes too intense for observing on any stratagems but their own the card passions are all at work breaking the unlucky chairs of some biting the lips gnashing the teeth slapping the foreheads or stamping the feet of others and while the  honours  are lost by one and the  odd trick  gained by another the mistress of the house slaves in hospitality and struggles through the elegant mob with more toil and difficulty than a landlady at an election dinner  "But somewhat too much of this" Let us fly from these artificial beings to the children of nature and the heart Suffer me to reconduct you to the simple yet everblooming paths from which these worldwarped tribes have too long led us astray  Allow me to place you once more within sight of the flute and voice I mentioned to you before and listen to the magic that ensued The wood notes wild as they were charmed  me I rose and advanced A few paces brought me within sight of a cottage door which was wide open The song and music proceeded mingled with dancing of which I could rather hear the happy step than perceive the enlivening figure But I was presently observed and actually as fair a maid accompanied by as blooming a youth as Arcadia ever fancied tripped forward without quitting hands to invite me into their dwelling You are here prepared for  "The white wash'd wall the nicely sanded floor  "The decent clock that click'd behind the door c"  All these and more were to be seen but the insides of cottages in all countries have been so many thousand times furnished and unfurnished either by real tourmakers or those who like the Virtuoso in the comedy only travel in books then publish their  travels through other people's books  all which you know may be very commodiously done at home without stirring out of their elbowchairs and moreover  bookcottages  are all so much alike for neatness accommodation arrangement and furniture that I could rather wish you would upon this as upon a former occasion make choice of the description you like best out of the whole collection of voyages and travels  that may be in your library and assure yourself that whatever comes nearest to a simplicity which does not exclude convenience will give you a just idea of my Westphalian cot  As the first day of the Carme was solemnizing while I was at the village chapel so that on which I entered this woodland habitation was the last of that festival and this peasant family were then celebrating it Religion therefore no less than hospitality and both under guidance of sincerity invited me to assist at the felicity Every simple delicacy of fruit and flower was in an instant placed before me Their discourse was so provincial that probably a German citizen of Cleves might have found a difficulty to decypher it But the language of bounty like that of love is universal  "All heads can reach it and all hearts conceive"  It is the volume of nature one of its fairest pages was spread open Had I run I could have read it and believe me my generous friend it exhibited instruction well worth the observance of those who live in prouder dwellings I found here no broad coarse ridicule at my ignorance none at my intrusion I was a stranger within the gate but I received the  welcome of a friend I discovered no wish to know from whence I came or whither I was going save a short expressed assurance that when I myself found it proper for me to depart I might be sure of being put into the right way A very old man and woman a labourer who was the musician the youth and maiden whom I have before mentioned and three more couple of lads and lasses formed the assembly Soon after my entrance every body sound something to do for me expressive of goodwill The aged man gave up his rush arm chair and insisted on my occupying it the matron his wife contributed a cushion from a wicker one that stood opposite the eldest daughter still in a dancing step the carriage of the lightest articles disputed by her attendant youth in his dancing measures also brought to the table and spread on it a cloth white even as her apparent innocency Another presented me with a bowl of new milk another with fruits another came bounding in with flowers moistened by the evening dewdrop Bread butter and slices of ham were added to the banquet and when I had nothing left to be done for me my entertainers did not stand like many even British rustics so taken by surprize to stare me out of appetite and with wide opened mouths as if they could  themselves swallow all that they had set before me but wishing me good appetite resumed their festivities Never was the banquet of a monarch more harmoniousseldom so disinterestedly but all at once I missed the musician and one of the dancers supplied his place the old man nodded time with his head then beat it with his stick and the matron accompanied with her foot Time flew insensiblythe sun was in an other hemispherethe moon setthe stars became clouded and the combining influence of these several circumstances forced on me the consideration then first remembered that I was a benighted gleaner several leagues from the town whence I had wandered by innumerable cross paths just as fancy had carried me The good people read my embarrassment and chased it away by fresh dances songs and music in the midst of which up rose the veteran and with an air of gallantry giving his hand to the aged dame who had literally been his partner for eight and fifty years hobbled an alamande with much more agility than could have been expected He then run into a dance which they call  Schleifern  consisting simply in two persons of either sex taking hold of each other's dress behind and moving in a circle to slow music a waylost man in a stormy night  upon an heath would have forgot his condition while this dance was performing had he reflected on the occasion of it which was a genuine effusion of hospitality to man and gratitude to God The young folks became almost wild with pleasure and struck into many artless gaities till they encircled the old ones in a kind of spontaneous dance which gradually contracted the circle so that in the end they had the aged couple closed within their arms Every one present formed a part of the loveknot and had share of the embrace It was one of the prettiest impromptu's of gaity and affection I ever beheld and I repeat that a traveller who had unknown leagues at midnight to measure back without a guide must have forgot his fears When the frolic was over the good veteran led his ancient dame back to her chair with the same courtesy and natural grace he had conducted her from it and as she sat down there was a transitory glow in her cheeks which exercise and felicity had called into them It was a momentary renovation of her youthful days in which she must have been extremely handsome for time that had robbed her of the colourings had committed less violent ravage on the proportions of her beauty Her husband looked at  her  with affection and then at the company  with some little elevation of selflove at the feats he had performed  Before these animating trifles of great figure in domestic happiness had time to grow cold the original musician whom I told you was the labourer returned introducing an old soldier who saluted me at first sight in excellent French which almost in the next instant he translated into very interpretable though ungrammatical English He lost no time in telling me that the cottager had fetched him from an house where he had been passing part of the Carme above a league's distance for no other reason than to conduct me back to the place from whence I came promising me at the same time said the soldier a suitable reward for my trouble but that I shall not accept of seeing I have the honour Sir to be your countryman  Consider my friend awhile the unbought nay unsollicited hospitality of this groupe of poor peasantstake a retrospect of their behaviourfinish the picture by supposing you see the old man and his wife  thanking me  for the pleasure they had in entertaining me fail not to paint on the canvass the old soldier offering himself to me as a voluntary guide  in case I should persist in refusing the bed which both the aged and the young would have yielded to me then on setting out under favour of the rising moon let your imagination give form and figure to the whole groupe of youths and maidens attending me part of the way still dancing while the honest minstrel labourer compleated the midnight serenade And the whole was performed with so much sport glee and goodwill to the sounds of which a thousand woodland echoes responded that the veriest misanthrope would have been converted into a lover of mankind I do protest to you I never felt my pulses vibrate with more enthusiasm It was with difficulty I forced upon the musical labourer a small present or rather payment for fetching the soldier and when all but the last left me a sentiment of regret struck my bosom and grew more and more comfortless as the sound of their retreating footsteps and voices diminished on my ear and when even on standing a moment to listen a pause to which my grateful heart impelled methey could be heard no more the sensation swelled almost into tears  The soldier seemed to feel a sort of sympathy and amused the way with the adventures of his life They did not however begin to interest  me so soon as they might have done had they been related at any other season He told me however that he had lived so many years out of his native country that he had almost forgot his mother tongue as you may perceive Sir said he by my bad English He added that he had served his late Prussian Majesty the grand Frederick almost seven and thirty years and had the honour to have been shot in almost every battle and part of the human body but was still as heartwhole and carefree as any man in the circle of Westphalia The Grand Frederick Sir continued he has settled upon me a little pension and given me a snug apartment in the Chateau of Cleves where should your honour deign to come I have always a glass of good Rhenish to offer an Englishman aye and any other honest man and where if your honour pleases we will drink the kings of England and Prussia for they now happen to be good friends you know in a bumper before we get into bed Thus ended my little jubilee to the infinite content of my heart and I trust of your's At least I can wish you no greater good than that each of your future days may be crowned like this and that your after slumbers may be as sweet  LETTER LXIV TO THE SAME  THE weekly visitation of the begging friars and Sunday assemblies are amongst the things which should be recommended to the notice of those who go into Westphalia being both really curious in their kind  In regard to the first it is an invariable rule for one or other of the mendicant brothers to make the tour of the town in or near which his convent is situated Sanctioned by the custom of his country he gains admittance into every house whether public or private and is "happy to catch you just at dinnertime" He moves round the table with his little box into which every one puts or appears to put something but evidently more as a thing of course than charity He neither speaks nor is spoken to he glides almost unheard and unseen behind your chair and having finished his collections which are probably scanty enough he bows off as he bowed on  The second circumstance viz the Sunday evening card route is full as singular but by no means so silent It is composed of thirty and forty frequently more of the most respectable persons of the town who after the devotions of the sabbath which they perform with great exactness almost indeed to rigour assemble at the best inn and pass the evening partly over a pack of cards and partly over a good supper The last time I was at the city of Cleves where I have now in fancy set you down I was an eyewitness to this supplement to the Sunday duties there being at that time no less than seven tables well furnished with preparations for the nocturnal association Travellers of any decent appearance are always welcome There is never any thing like a debauch and the company separate about twelve The singularity of all this consists only in its opposition to our  modes  of doing the same thing in Great Britain and we may truly say the matter is more elegantly conducted in London Would it not be thought very odd for the nobility and gentry of both sexes and of the first character to meet at a tavern in that great city where the moment a lady made her appearance a stove full of hot coals was placed under her petticoats and on the entrance  of each man of fashion an immense pipe with a spitting box  How often in the traverse of different countries has a traveller occasion to exclaim with the poet  "I see full plainly custom forms us all"  And in truth it requires the strongest power of our habits to reconcile us to some things that will rise up in our way as we journey along  Amongst other  preparations  with which my zeal has armed you let me not omit to beseech that you will make up your mind to the  dirty  doings of Westphalian Prussia and indeed in certain cases of the whole Germanic empire I have in a former letter invited your observation to a comparative view of the countries of Holland and Prussia in respect of the gradual relief which the eye receives from the fatiguing uniformity of the one to the rising diversities of the other but this is not the only matter that awaits your attention O ye readers of this history and ye sojourners in this land Would ye see placed before you one of the most striking contrasts in the world behold it in the general neatness of the Hollander and almost universal filth of the Prussian and German  It is impossible for an Englishman whose eyes are by no means unaccustomed to the decencies of life in his own country to withhold the tribute of his admiration on the peculiar niceties of the towns within and without from his first landing in Holland to his taking leave of its Seven Provinces The doorways the passages the windows the inner apartments the kitchen the very lumberrooms where by the bye every stick board and other unoccupied thing is laid in a picturesque manner as if by the hand of symmetry the warehouses where industry is for ever at hard and very often at dirty work the very outhouses which frequently connect with the general sittingroom and in which perhaps twenty cows are stalled on the one side and as many horses stabled on the other and in which all sorts of domestic fowls nay where not seldom the very pigs are nourished each and all of these places are kept in such order disposed in such arrangement and with such uniform cleanliness that whether it proceeds from the necessity of the climate in regard to the influence which its humidity otherwise might have upon the health or whether from a principle or only an habit of neatness it is certainly a charming custom  "More honour'd in the observance than the breach"  But the offensive reverse is forced upon you almost immediately on your quitting the confines of the Stadtholder The disgusting contrast will strike you in  almost every particular  so that if you please to reperuse the list of the items above stated taking their opposite that is reading dirty for clean as you go on you will have before you a picture of Dutch nicety and Prussian nastiness  And the remark is to be extended to persons as well as things Notwithstanding the incessant toil which an unremitting attention to neatness in a flat foggy country must occasion there is in the midst of their labours an air of  propreté  The common servants even in their drudgery are always to be seen with clean stockings which are always shewn to the middle of the leg slippers which notwithstanding the violent motion of the mop and pail hang on the foot as if by magic and head dresses which are oftener seen without hat or bonnet be the weather what it may Whereas in the neighbouring countries the houses are more  mal propre  than the stables of Holland and the Sunday apparel of the common people females more especially is worse got up and worse put on than the Saturday night workingdresses of the Dutch peasantry  In your perusal of this and every other similar account I must once again warn you that I confine myself principally to the inns hotels and other public places to which a traveller must of necessity first repair or to those private lodgings which if he makes any stop are usually his second movement But it may be received as a general rule that if all these places are in one country neat inviting and regular and in another utterly different it is fair and candid to draw this inference that dirt is the general characteristic of the one country and cleanliness of the other Certain it is I have seen regularity elegance and delicacy in the circle of Westphalia and I have also witnessed the reverse of these in Holland but these can be considered only as exceptions to the general rule  No human being is more aware than yourself my dear friend that there are certain  decencies  in civil society which are always very charming and in certain cases not a little embarrassing but without the adroit performance of which human nature in some of its highest luxuries no less than in several of its lowest necessities is but a very dirty piece of business Amongst these decencies is one concerning which an English traveller not yet assimilated to the manners  of other countries and retaining and ever wishing to retain a respect for the decorums of his own is at a loss how to write particularly when those writings will probably come under the eyes of his delicate countrywomen Yet a little adventure on this  ticklish  subject met me on the way so extremely characteristic of the manners of at least one half of the civilized globe and so extremely  un  characteristic of one comfortable corner of the earth where the  personal delicacies  if not the Graces have taken up their abode that I cannot in fair description help going over this  trembling ground  to give you its Gleanings Now Yorick would have made no difficulty on this occasion He could you know reconcile his readers to whatever matter he thought proper to set before them but as I by no means possess the magic of that illustrious traveller I do not feel myself entitled to the indulgences which such magic claims and shall therefore not presume to take the same liberties  In a certain fair district then within and but just within the circle of Westphalia there stands a pleasant and very considerable town situated on the banks of the Lower Rhine y'clept Emerick Its extreme beauty excited in me a first sight wish to make a stop of  some weeks and being arrived just at that period of life when the comfort of a good night's rest in a good bed is considered as one of the necessaries of life in however tumultuary a manner one passes the day I preferred private to public lodgings and accordingly after due refreshment went out in search of them My broken German dialect stood me in good stead on this occasion I soon saw a lodging bill and knocked at the door but the master and mistress of it being from home I had to blunder out my meaning to four domestics who I fancy babbled a jargon less intelligible than my own though no country could appropriate it it was a mixture of all but the proportions of the compound went more to Dutch Clevesland and German than to any other language In this patois they gave me to understand as well as they could that the heads of the house being absent nothing could be done till their return on the morrow I was by convention with a party of acquaintance to sleep that night at the distance of two leagues and left the house without any favourable prepossessions resolving to take a future opportunity to look for other lodgings But judge of my surprize when the lord of this unpromising habitation made his appearance in my chamber before I had risen the next morning to assure me he  was in despair at my disappointment in not seeing his apartments which he protested to God were the most pleasant most airy and most beautiful of any in the Westphalian circle and he verily believed in the German territory Then ensued the following question and answer conversation which I will endeavour to render intelligible without a  says I  or  says he  to the irksome repetition of which I have as mortal an objection as Marmontel himself Would I could as happily prove it expletive Are these apartments well furnishedDelightfully in every part of themThen I wish my little temporary menage to be sometimes at home is this possibleEvery earthly convenience SirPerhaps then I might now and then dine  en famille  Nothing so easyYou have no doubt a proper tableI only wish you would do me the honour to come and judge for yourself I honour the English and live very much in the English fashion ROST BIF on the table every SundayIt were needless then to ask if you can give me a good bedThe best and softest in the circlethat's allIndeed then they need not be betterNo truly and I have had such lodgers to lie upon them No less than the flower of the nobility of all nationsLe Comte de A la Comtesse de B Madame la Duchesse de C the duke  of D the earl of E bishop F baroness G and a string of the first titles all the way to Z  As the man ran through these illustrious instials in alphabetical order I beg'd to know if he was indulging himself in a laugh upon that stale trick of travellers the assuming false titles while they were making the grand tourand if so the satire was well enough directed against such a pettifogging ambition which however was pretty well punish'd already as these fictitious  grandenrs  are generally charg'd in every bill upon the road Laugh no I never was more serious as to the whole alphabet of great folks having at different times occupied my apartments although they did not happen to come into them in the exact Dictionary form and order aforesaid And as to a travelling title while a lady or gentleman pays up to the price of nobility there is no question but she or he are right noble and honourable  Although I now perceived there was a spice of the wag in mine host I began to think there might be some part of his house which did not at first strike the view and which might spurn all sort of connexion with  the miserable shop at the door of which I had entered In short I now fear'd that instead of finding the mansion too bad I should find it for a quiet observing and unobserv'd Gleaner too good With that kind of alteration of air and tone therefore which an honest and welltemper'd man glides into when he supposes he has undervalued any thing by an overhasty judgment I informed the master that I was apprehensive his rooms would be too spacious and splendid for my purpose that I was by no means any one of the superb personages of his alphabet but simply an Englishman in pursuit of health and the pure air and water which so greatly contribute to them but for which I could not afford to pay too dear a price  By no means too dear you will have them sir in a manner for nothingand as for air and water I say nothingvous verrez I wont say any thingnot a syllableperdie yous verrezyou will seeI do not suppose there is such air in the heavens nor such water under themvous verrezthat's all  Then you may expect me at Emerick the next morningI kept my word Mine host was standing in expectation at his door and  scarce gave me time to speak before he ran with me through the shop before commemorated and which after all was the only way of entrance Then he took me into a poor whitewash'd brick bottom'd rough pav'd back room with one window opening to the Rhine but so loaded with iron bars without and so guarded by a net work of rusty wire that you could only get a peep at the river  au traverse  Then recommenc'd the Dialogue there's an apartment for you sirthere's a salle superbe à manger ou pour voir le monde yes there's a noble diningroom or to receive company  Not allowing me a moment's time to reply he dash'd with me into a sort of kitchen at the back of this superbe Salle and throwing open a door at one end of it bade me take care of my head which was a very necessary caution the doorway making it convenient to save that head from being broke by doubling the rest of the body He mounted a ladder and taking my hand hawl'd me after him Up we both went as absolute a perpendicular of near forty stairs as ever led to the mainmast head of a first rate man of war I do assure you the strong wing of a pigeon would have required a little breathing as it ascended  My landlord allow'd of none but kept exclaimingnow now we shall come to a charmante Kamera charming chamberAt the end of our clambering we reach'd a room that had neither bed chair or glass I was about to express my surprize at this when anxious to shew me all his lions my hurry scurry guide hurried me to a  very little apartment indeed  the door of which he was proceeding to open with his accustomed rapidity when a voice from within exclaimed in a tranquilliz'd tone Arrête un petit moment s'il vous plait Monfieur Stop a moment sir if you please To which courteous request the landlord recognizing the voice and bowing towards the door replied Ne vous derangez pas Mademoifelle Pray Miss dont disturb yourselfand while the young lady settles this little assair we may look about us sir quoth hethere you see good sir is the Rhine again and you have it also as you shall presently see in the room adjoining What do you think of my water now sir And as for air can any thing be better contriveddo but observe the delectable situation of this sameah sacontinued he addressing the late occupier of the very little apartment who now made her appearanceah sanow you shall judge of the agrémens of my lodgingsbe so good to step  in sirthere's neatnessmarble pavement sides of best Dutch tileingand observe still the delicious Rhine rolling under you  Here he pointed to another outlet where I must confess I should never have thought of looking for a prospectBut the master of the mansion absolutely piqued himself upon it There sir what do you think of thatIn your very bed chamberalmost within reach of your bed Monsieurthere's comfort there's recommendationAssurement bien commode said the young lady joining in the conversation with all the ease in the world Indeed she had left the door open on her coming out purely with a design to assist the great character her friend and relation as I afterwards understood he was had given itThe man concluded his eulogy by again intreating to know what I thought of it Hereupon I observed to him that though I could not say they settle these matters  better  in Westphalia than in England yet they do settle them in the former place much more at their  ease  The lady had just left the room so that my answer was addressed only to my officious groom of the chamber who was extremely surprised  when I told him that the little adventure of the little lady in the little apartment could never gain credit were I to relate it in my country nay could never have happened in any decent part of the kingdom of England except by an accident which would have covered even a girl of ten years old with confusion and made a female of maturer age ashamed to lift her eye to the discoverer if he happened to be a man for some days after I added that the sense of decency was so nice in my country that very serious illnesses had sometimes been incurred from the dread of some such exposure Ma foi cela est bien bisarre i'faith that's whimsical enough said the manHe then shewed off the rest of his house in the same inflated style of panegyric And pray where are the superb beds They may be had sir in a month and I might have the beautiful salle below and the charming chamber above and the delicious apartment thereunto belonging for so very trifling a sum as seven hundred florins a year and my diet for seven hundred more The enormity of the demand being no less a sum than would purchase the feesimple of the whole house shop and little apartment into the bargain brought our discourse to a short conclusion I could not but feel it as an insult levell'd at his  opinion of English folly and left his house with telling him I was sorry we had taken up so much of each other's time to so little purpose He seemed to think so too and dropping his vivacity and his courtesy at once suffer'd me to depart even without a bow My friend I beg pardon and your's my good Reader I dare say you are  nice  but I presume also you are  wise  the delicacies of your countrythe graceful decency of its manners and customs deserve to be appreciated but inasmuch as they are brought into comparison and contrast with the disgusting freedoms of other nations they will be yet more valued and appear more amiable  In truth people of both sexes on this side the water have scarce and idea of those decencies which by habit if not by principle discover themselves even in the lowest domesticks of Great Britain Throughout Holland Prussia and the Empire even more than in France the men and women display almost  ostentatiously  those objects which we conceal with the greatest care As if proud of the natural defects that are considered as humiliating with us you will see them carrying to and fro in open day and as a sort of pageantry of  display  all the arcana of the bedchamber  whether you are in sickness or in health it is the same thing and I have remarked that the servants who preside over these shews in England they would be  mysteries  and disposed of as if by magicthe servants I say generally choose to exhibit their machines at breakfast by passing from one room to another not so much as supposing it  possible  your delicacy can be distressed about the matter Our sense of propriety on this occasion passes for  manvaise honte  May it never be exchanged for either confident impudence or habitual grossness which though less culpable is not less offensive In a word may that  shamefacedness  which the holy writers have used to signify one of the most lovely virtues in opposition to the boldest vice ever continue to be reckoned amongst the prejudices of British education A prayer in which I am sure your own modest nature and chastened manners will heartily join your affectionate friend  LETTER LXV TO THE SAME  IN our first sheaf I collected for you a Gleaning of the village superstitions of Wales I will now offer you those of Germany especially in the country of Juliers Le Mark c bordering on Westphalia The country people of those places have the most solemn faith in sorceries and witches who though in their proper shape are only a pack of very old women can assume any form either bestial or human but are it seems most fond of appearing in the character of cats Some of this witchery is carried to such excess that many people in the country of Juliers will on no consideration intermarry with a person who may be supposed of having a sorcerer's blood in his veins nay the most advantageous matches have been refused and the attractions of love itself been resisted rather than a daughter should go to the arms of a man who has ever had a witch in his family and the geneological tree was never more cautiously examined and traced by a birthproud noble to escape the disgrace of pollution than it is to avoid an alliance with a sorcerer or sorceress If there  can be found in the history of twenty generations only twigs sufficient to make up one hereditary besom or broomstic on which the witch by descent might horse two of her singers not only the shuddering parent but the trembling lover would consider it as strong a bar to his marriage as if his mistress had been taken in incest  They believe also in loupgarou's or menwolves a gentleman of the first character here for learning and integrity but who unhappily for his country is now no more Mr Bauman of the Privy Council of Cleves and first pastor of the reformed church related to me the story of a man at Cologne who assumed the character of a loupgarou and who lived by the pillage of whatever in that character he could lay his hands on for many years insomuch that he had amassed great wealth as well in money as valuable moveables but he was at last assaulted and taken by a country man who swore he defied the devil and all his works and who had been long marked with a general opprobrium for this daring disbelief of evil spirits This man was encountered by the loupgarou on the day he was known to have sold a quantity of corn at the Cologne market and to have received the money but so far was he from  tamely yielding up his honest profits to either man or beast that instead of flying with terror before the wolfman or dropping his moneybag he held the said bag at the extent of his arm which was a powerful one and felled the thief to the earth with that very gold and silver which he would have purloined When he somewhat recovered the blow our heroic farmer threw him like a stunned calf over his horse even in his wolves cloathing and delivered him over to the magistrate who after the due course of law ordered him to be hanged in his loupgarou dress in the public marketplace of Cologne One would have thought this disaster would have opened the eyes of superstition but alas eyes hath she and seeth not Neither are her votaries to be driven from the steadfast faith that was in them by the detection of a single impostor On the contrary the Colognians believe at least they have a tradition at this day that the real loupgarou being angry with the man that was hanged got into him and in order to be revenged put it into the head of the farmer that he might be taken up as a thief and come to an untimely end but that the instant the halter was round the pretender's neck the  spirit  of the real wolfman slipped out of him again and enjoyed his triumph to think how  cleverly he had brought his enemy to the gallows Thus the very circumstances that ought to weaken supersution give it strength  Their credulity embraces also feveral other imaginary beings particularly of the fairy tribe These however differ from our's in some of their manners and customs They are of the same species but inhabitants of a different country you know The most popular of the fairies of Germany are supposed to be little men and women who inhabit the iron and copper mines and are in general very gracious and obliging For instance they will come in the night time into houses and when a maid servant happens to be on good terms with them that is when she believes in their power with all her might they will clean her plates and dishes after an entertainment put her rooms in order and even give her an idea of it in her sleep so that as a fairy was never known in this country to fib though with us they are somewhat given to lying she indulges herself with a nap extraordinary and is sure to find all her work done to her hands when she comes down They come also into shops warehouses c with the same industrious and good natured intention The taylor rises and finds the half finished suit ready to take home  the cobler his shoes c Nevertheless when illtreated these powerful little spirits are cruelly vindictive and will hide mangle and destroy every thing before them instead of assisting the artisan they will pull his work to pieces instead of befriending the poor maid servant they will trepan her with fair promises that thus cajoled they may tempt her to lie in bed that she may get a good scolding In fine those persons who take any delight in knowing our neighbours are on the whole upon a level with ourselves may please themselves with the thought that if foreigners have all the virtues they have likewise all the weaknesses of human nature  I should not forget under the article supersition to mention that in the pretty country of  uthward of Westphalia they have an Idea that cats are to be reconciled to a new residence only by coercive measures In pursuance of which notion a widow woman at whose house I lodged imprisoned a poor cat three nights and days in a dark room to the entire destruction of my rest and almost to the cat's insanity in order to make her in love with her new house Now in England you know where cats are not a whit more remarkable for an amiable disposition we should have  stroked the poor animal till she purred approbation we should have permitted her to feed and sleep the first night by our fireside and so hospitably treated her that at the breakfast table next morning she would have found herself one of the family  Not that I would have you suppose I am an advocate for the feline race except on general principles of justice and mercy A dog is often an  example  to his master and a proper object of his love honour imitation and good faith But a cat I take to be with very rare exceptions indeed both a traitor and a sycophant She is won to you only by fawnings and if you punish her on ever so just a cause she either strikes immediately or owes you a grudge the unexecuted malice of which she can hold till an opportunity of vengeance occurs Even when you imagine you have gained her affections she will desert you like a faithless lover and elope from your arms  Perhaps you may not think this the proper moment to introduce an anecdote of one of these insidious creatures You may suspect me of imitating the Grimalkin disposition by sitting down in malice Were I about to become an accuser it might be so but what I have now  to mention exhibits no charge though it will report an unlucky event  In this very town of Cleves which with its environs will detain us some time longer I was residing with a Prussian family during the time of the fair which I shall pass over having nothing remarkable to distinguish it from other annual meetings where people assemble to stare at cheat each other and divert themselves and to spend the year's savings in buying those bargains which would have been probably better bought at home One day after dinner as the desert was just brought on the table the travelling German musicians who commonly ply the houses at these times presented themselves and were suffered to play and just as they were making their bows for the money they received for their harmony a birdcatcher who had rendered himself famous for educating and calling forth the talents of the feathered race made his appearance and was well received by our party which was numerous and benevolent The musicians who had heard of this birdcatcher's same begged permission to stay and the master of the house who had a great share of goodnature indulged their curiosity a curiosity indeed which every body participated for all that we have  heard or seen of learned pigs asses dogs and horses was said to be extinguished in the wonderful wisdom which blazed in the genius of this birdcatcher's canary The canary was produced and the owner harangued him in the following manner placing him upon his forefinger Bijou jewel you are now in the presence of persons of great sagacity and honour take heed you do not deceive the expectations they have conceived of you from the world's report you have got laurels beware their withering In a word deport yourself like the bijou the jewel of canary birds as you certainly are  All this time the bird seemed to listen and indeed placed himself in the true attitude of attention by sloping his head to the ear of the man and then distinctly nodding twice when his master left off speaking and if ever nods were intelligible and promissory these were two of them  That's good says the master pulling off his hat to the bird Now then let us see if you are a canary of honour Give us a tuneThe canary sung Pshaw that's too harsh 'tis the note of a raven with a hoarseness upon  him something pathetic The canary whistled as if its little throat was changed to a lute Faster says the manSlowervery well but what a plague is this foot about and this little headNo wonder you are out Mr Bijou when you forget your time That's a jewel  Bravo bravo  my little man  All that he was ordered or reminded of did he do to admiration His head and foot beat timehumoured the variations both of tone and movement and "the sound was a just echo to the sense" according to the strictest laws of poetical and as it  ought  to be of musical composition  Bravo bravo  reechoed from all parts of the diningroomThe musicians swore the canary was a greater master of music than any of their band And do you not shew your sense of this civility Sir cries the birdcatcher with an angry air The canary bowed most respectfully to the great delight of the company His next achievement was going through martial exercise with a straw gun after which my poor bijou says his owner thou hast had hard work and must be a little weary a few performances more and thou shalt repose Shew the ladies how to make a curtsey  The bird here crossed his taper legs and sunk and rose with an ease and grace that would have put half our subscription assembly belles to the blushThat's my fine birdand now a bow head and foot corresponding Here the striplings for ten miles round London might have blushed also Let us finish with an hornpipe my brave little fellowthat's itkeep it up keep it up  The activity glee spirit and accuracy with which this last order was obeyed wound up the applause in which all the musicians joined as well with their instruments as their clappings to the highest pitch of admiration Bijou himself seemed to feel the sacred thirst of fame and shook his little plumes and carolled an  Io paean  that sounded like the conscious notes of victory  Thou hast done all my biddings bravely said the master caressing his feathered servant now then take a nap while I take thy place Hereupon the canary went into a counterfeit slumber so like the effect of the poppied god first shutting one eye then the other then nodding then dropping so much on one side that the hands of several of the company were stretched out to save him from falling and just  as those hands approached his feathers suddenly recovering and dropping as much on the other at length the sleep seemed to fix him in a steady posture whereupon the man took him from his finger and laid him flat upon the table where the man assured us he would remain in a good sound sleep while he himself had the honour to do his best to fill up the interval Accordingly after drinking a glass of wine in the progress of taking off which he was interrupted by the canary bird springing suddenly up to assert his right to a share really putting his little bill into the glass and then laying himself down to sleep again the owner called him a saucy fellow and began to shew off his own independent powers of entertaining The  forte  of these lay chiefly in balancing with a tobacco pipe while he smoked with another and several of the positions were so difficult to be preserved yet maintained with such dexterity that the general attention was fixed upon him But while he was thus exhibiting an huge black car who had been no doubt on the watch from some unobserved corner sprung upon the table seized the poor canary in its mouth and rushed out of the window in despite of opposition Though the dining room was emptied in an instant it was a vain pursuit the life of the bird was gone and its  mangled body was brought in by the unfortunate owner in such dismay accompanied by such looks and language as must have awaked pity in a misanthrope He spread him halflength over the table and mourned his canarybird with the most undissembled sorrow Well may I grieve for thee poor little thing well may I grieve more than four years hast thou fed from my hand drank from my lip and flept in my bosom I owe to thee my support my health my strength and my happiness without thee what will become of me Thou it was who ensured my welcome in the best company It was thy genius only made me welcome But thy death is a just punishment for my vanity had I relied only on thy happy powers all had been well and thou hadst been perch'd on my finger or lulled in my breast at this moment but trusting to my own talents and glorifying myself in them a judgment has fallen upon me and thou art dead and mangled on this table Accursed be the hour I entered this house and more accursed the detestable monster that killed thee Accursed be  myself  for I contributed I ought not to have taken away my eyes when thine were closed in frolic O bijou my dearest only bijou would I were dead also  As near as the spirit of his disordered mind can be transfused such was the language and sentiment of the forlorn birdcatcher whose despairing motion and frantic air no words can paint He took from his pocket a little green bag of faded velvet and taking out of it some wool and cotton that were the wrapping of whistles bird calls and other instruments of his trade all of which he threw on the table "as in scorn" and making a couch placed the mutilated limbs and ravaged feathers of his canary upon it and renewed his lamentations  These were now much softened as is ever the case when the rage of grief yields to its tenderness when it is too much overpowered by the effect to advert to the cause It is needless to observe to you that every one of the company sympathised with him But none more than the band of  musicians  who being engaged in a profession that naturally keeps the sensibilities more or less in exercise felt the distress of the poor birdman with peculiar force It was really a banquet to see these people gathering themselves into a knot and after whispering wiping their eyes and blowing their noses depute one from amongst them to be the medium of conveying into the pocket  of the birdman the very contribution they had just before received for their own efforts The poor fellow perceiving them took from the pocket the little parcel they had rolled up and brought out with it by an unlucky accident another little bag at the sight of which he was extremely agitated for it contained the canary seed the food of the "dear lost companion of his art" There is no giving language to the effect of this trifling circumstance upon the poor fellow he threw down the contribution money that he brought from his pocket along with it not with an ungrateful but with a desperate hand He opened the bag which was fastened with red tape and taking out some of the seed put it to the very bill of the lifeless bird exclaimingNo poor bijou nothou can'st not peck any more out of this hand that has been thy feeding place so many yearsthou can'st remember how happy we both were when I bought this bag full for thee Had it been filled with gold thou had'st deserved it It shall be  filled  and with gold said the master of the house if I could afford it  The good man rose from his seat which had long been uneasy to him and gently taking the bag put into it some silver saying as he  handed it to his nearest neighbour who will refuse to follow my example it is not a subscription for mere charity it is a tribute to one of the rarest things in the whole world namely to real feeling in this sophistical pretending parading age If ever the passion of love and gratitude was in the heart of man it is in the heart of that unhappy fellow and whether the object that calls out such feelings be bird beast fish or man it is alike virtue and ought  to be rewarded  said his next neighbour putting into the bag his quota It is superfluous to tell you that after the seed had been taken wholly away and put very delicately out of the poor man's sight every body most chearfully contributed to make up a purse to repair as much as money could the birdman's loss The last person applied to was a very beautiful German young lady who as she placed her bounty into the bag closed it immediately after and blushed As there are all sorts of blushes at least one to every action of our lives that is worth any characteristic feeling supposing the actor can feel at all Suspicion would have thought this young lady who was so anxious to conceal her gift gave little or nothing but candour who reasons in a different manner would suppose what was really the casethat it was a blush not of  avarice and deception but of benevolence graced by modesty Curiosity however caught the bag opened it and turned out its contents amongst which was a  golden ducat  that by its date and brightness had been hoarded Ah ha said curiosity who does this belong to I wonder Guilt and innocence avarice and benignity are alike honest in one point since they all in the moment of attack by some means or another discover what they wish to conceal There was not in the then large company a single person who could not have exclaimed to this young lady with assurance of the truth  Thou art the woman  There was no denying the fact it was written on every feature of her enchanting face She struggled however with the accusation almost to tears but they were such tears as would have given lustre to the finest eyes in the world for they gave lustre to her's and would have added effulgence to a ray of the sun  Well then if no body else will own this neglected ducat cried the master of the house who was uncle to the lady abovementioned I will whereupon he took it from the heap and exchanged it for two others which enriched the collection  While the business of the heart was thus carrying on the poor birdman who was the  occasion and object of it was at first divided by contrary emotions of pain and pleasure his eye sometimes directed to the massacred canary and sometimes to the company at length generosity proved the stronger emotion and grief ebbed away He had lost a bird but he had gained the goodwill of many human beings That bird it is true was his pride and support but this was not the crisis any longer to bewail its fate He accepted the contributionpurse by one means or another filled like the sack of Benjamin even to the brim and bowed but spoke not then folding up the corpse of the canary in its wool and cotton shroud departed with one of those looks that the moment it is seen is felt and understood but for which being too powerful for description no language has yet been provided On going out he beckoned the musicians to follow They did so striking a few chords that would have graced the funeral of Juliet My very soul pursued the sounds and so did my feet I hasted to the outer door and saw the birdman contending about returning the money which the  founders  of the benevolence for such were the musicians had subscribed  I have nothing to add to this Gleaning but a piece of information that belongs to it the very next morning I was a witness to two traits of the heart of the master of the mansion where these transactions had past A nobler minded man lived notAlas he is no more On my coming down to breakfast the day after I saw the footman departing with the  cat who killed the bird  not said the gentleman to put her to death for an act that was natural to her but to put her where I know she will be out of my fight for I never could look at her again without being reminded of the most uncomfortable part of yesterday's adventure poor bijou I have not a doubt but all we have done atones but scantily for the loss of such a friend Just as he said this the niece whose person and mind I have already gleaned for you came into the breakfast room And now said the old gentleman to finish this business Look ye Henrietta I gave you this new ducat to lay out at the fair in any manner you liked best and though I think the way in which you disposed of it the very best you could have chosen nay no more blushing I think it never ought to go out of our family for do you know that I have taken it into my old superstitious head that the blessing of the Giver of  all  good will stay with us while such a ducat remains amongst us I  therefore bought it back cheaply with two others Age is superstitious you know my dear Indulge me then love and take care of it while I live after which it shall be your's and in the meantime that you may not lose your fairing in this little purse are ten others that though not so distinguished by what to my old heart is more precious than the gold of Ophir may serve well enough the common purposes of life  Much of this was spoken with tender difficulty and the gift was received with more but she loved the hand which in the first instance had enabled her to be generous too well not to reward it Was not this indeed an illustration of the virtue of the man of Ross who  "Did good yet  blush'd  to find it fame"  To apologize to you for this story as I have said on former occasions would be to insult you and myself I rather expect your thanks  LETTER LXVI TO THE SAME  AND you tell me I am not disappointed I  have  your thanks Under such encouragements I resume the pen with alacrity It is inconsistent with the plan of this correspondence to set down a formal list of roads or routes or to present a meagre catalogue of cities towns and villages When you are at a centrical place as Cleves for instance you can scarce take an unpleasant course in such a Duchy and if you are disposed to make the tour of Westphalia on a plan of pleasure or health it is nearly immaterial whether from this its capital you verge towards the South or to the West the East or the North so abundant are the beauties on every side But previous to a more extensive excursion there are in reserve for the deliberate traveller a great variety of rural beauties which lie entirely out of the ordinary track and which are therefore generally past not only unseen but unheard of To some of these I shall direct you because they deserve your attention and will probably never otherwise have it A stranger no sooner gains  Cleves than he sets off for Dusseldorf Maestricht Aix la Chapelle or Spa and all the sweet side scenery and enchanting villages behind are left neglected because they do not happen to lie in the broad high road of a large town and to drive from one large town to another seems to be one of the grand resolutions of modern travel For this reason I presume it is that a real lover of the still small voice of nature may reside in an outoftheWAY village in any part of the Dutch Prussian or German dominions and never so much as hear it mentioned even amongst the  traditions  of the place that an English traveller had sojourned therein for a single day Hence to speak only of the hundreds of deliciouslysequestered spots that are situated in the neighbourhood of Arnheim and of Nimeguen one way and of Cleves and Emeric another you may as well look for the Emperor of Morocco as for an elegant foreigner or any resident foreigner at all except here and there a straggling family whom necessity hath driven into retreat But whether observed or not by the dustloving eyes of vanity and fashion nature goes silently and bloomingly on I would recommend  you  my friend and all other of her genuine admirers to seek her in the agreeable country of Kuyh in the little principality of Boxmeer and in  the enchanting bounds of Prussian Guelderland All of these indeed possess beauties that to be won must be woo'd for they are several leagues out of the common or if you please of the  fashionable  track but then they are in the direct road to nature and their paths are peace  I performed the whole tour of Prussian Guelderland on foot and I know not the period of my life that has been so truely pastoral I stopped at every town and village and verily think I should have been welcome at every house You are convinced of the general fertility of the soil by the abundant fleeces of the sheep and of the salubrity of the air by the florid countenances of the people Though the country must in a general view be called level it is furnished with great variety Long meandring green lanes pleasant interspersed thickets principally of fir and oak Arcadianlooking cottages all in the best repair venerable castles an infinity of towers steeples spires convents and ancient abbeys meadowgrounds often compacted into little verdant enclosures often expanded into spacious fields the whole fertilized by delicious streams fed by their parent flood the Maise which were it near my natal banks would become a rival  to the Thamesall these attracting objects diversify the view It must be owned that a league of uniformly dreary heath ground frequently intervenes but even this is relieved by herds flocks and shepherds and by the power of contrast the sterility becomes a not uninteresting object in a traveller's picture  For the inhabitants I scruple not to propose them in addition to my former observations amongst the models of imitation for the good people of England in point of pleasantry and useful courtesy I should be worse than ungenerous I should be ungrateful were I to refuse them their merits on this head In the course of one day's Gleaning as if destiny had planned it on purpose to shew me some specimens of real urbanity amongst a set of persons who had certainly never studied it as an art of politeness but cultivated it as a gift of nature I was blest with the happy faculty of losing my way frequently As I passed along from a little village called Geysteren to another named Venrai a shepherd perceiving me long before I saw him came running to assure me that I was out of all tracks and then enquiring my destination attended me on my way till it was too direct for any one but a man who deviates by design to miss His sheepdog quarrelled  with my little spaniel and the shepherd desirous to teach him some of his own good manners held him by the collar and harangued him on the subject of rudeness to strangers during which eloquence he growled yet more as cross creatures generally do when forced to hear good advice By that happy knack of getting into a  wrong  road with which I am gifted I was obliged to ask for the  right  just at sunsetting I saw a peasant at his door Pray friend is this the way to Venrai"This is the first house that belongs to quite a different town sir You are a mile further to the left than you ought to be" Off set my peasant without saying another word and did not stop till we had gained the first house of the hamlet I had enquired for "You must now go  right out  sir" said the guide and before I had time to thank or reward him he was out of sight  Earlier in the day I had enquired of an ancient woman on her way to the church the road to a little village called  Wel  on the banks of the Maise She informed me but suspecting I might not understand her she stood unasked till I had taken the right path The good woman then went away satisfied that she had done me a service By a sort of characteristic fatality I made the second turning the reverse  of my information "To the right about sir" quoth the old woman who espied me from another place where she had made a stand You my friend who know my methods will not wonder to hear that I followed the impulse which led me to run across the fields purely to take hold of her hand and give her the thanks of my heart By an impulse no less genuine and perhaps more generous she went back to my ground with me and would not leave me till she had made  as one would have thought  another mistake impossible  Yet I contrived it The bewitching story of Marmontel's shepherdess of the Alps which I read to relieve a long walk over a heath conducted me just at the termination of the said heath and of the said story into a farmer's yard Being Sabbathday the farmer was regaling himself with folded arms and a short pipe in his mouth Supposing I had business with him he conducted me into his house which was surely kept by the goddess of  Propreté  neatness if such a divinity there be I explained and apologised He smiled and thanked me"But you must be weary sir repose and refresh" In an instant as if by magic the table was spread and so white a cloth bread butter and milk so good and  a welcome so cordial that I must beg of you if ever you make the tour of Prussian Guelderland to attempt wandering by happy negligence or if that fails you by welltimed contrivance into a farmer's yard no matser where as this man is but a specimen of his countrymen  Nor were these examples of urbanity all at noon of the same day I was rescued from the most imminent danger by a good natured fellow who informed me I was making the best of my way into a quagmire Nor is this courtesy confined to the peasantry It extends to all classes At no ungleanable distance from my proper path I was attracted by a magnificent castle and relying on the courteous general character of the country I entered its venerable and aweinspiring gate The family were at Liege The domestic chaplain only remained at home He was saying grace and crossing himself just as I entered his apartmentPardon the  illtim'd  visit of a curious English strangerwas my opening speech "  Welltim'd  I hope it will prove as I am sure it is welcome" was his reply rising from his seat and placing me in it I had already in my kind of running way taken refreshments at half a dozen cottages an apple at one a  cake at another a cordial at a third and so on but the good chaplain "so gaily press'd and smil'd" as he set a clean cover napkin silver fork and spoon before me I could not but accept the invitation After our repast learning the object of my visit he made with me the tour of the chateau which had it been inspected by a critic in paintings pictures and an amateur of Gothic architecture would have been the journey of a day In our way back to his room we passed into a very noble garden with the fruits and flowers of which he loaded my pockets and hands and when after a parting glass of wine I left the apartment in which I had first seen him"Remember sir this has been parson's fare the next visit you make the owners of the castle whom I so faintly represent and who are to be here tonight will do you more honour" The name of this fine castle is  Wel  on the West side of a very picturesque little Prussian village upon the banks and almost upon the brims of the Rhine that majestic river which you know common geography tells you nd truly tells rises from two springs in the Alps and runs North to the lake of Constance then West to Basil afterwards North between Swabia and Alsace then passing through the Palatinate  the Electorate and the Duchy of Cleves at last enters the Netherlands five miles below Cleves where it becomes broad and rapid The direct course of this noble river is above miles it is generally one quarter and in some places half a mile broad and from one and a half to seven fathoms in depth It is navigable to Bafil in Switzerland which is four hundred miles by long boats with round bottoms which commonly go at the rate of four miles an hour and in these passengers are conveyed at the easy rate of one stiver one penny for five miles but the navigation of the Rhine like that of the Danube is interrupted by nine cataracts the principal of which is at Shaffhausan in Switzerland where the whole river falls from an height of feet But what is there in the whole of this description my friend that fills the imagination or warms the heart like the philanthropy of the chaplain of the castle The simple stream of good will that flowed from his bounty to me indicated a soul whose "genial current" had it not been checked by more obstructions than the cataracts of the Danube or the Rhine would have fertilized and enriched more than those mighty waters I have pursued the course of both these rivers for many a beautiful league  I have gazed with all the fondness of a real lover of nature and with something of a poet's eye on their numerous objects I have painted with an ardent pencil some of their landscapes I have often wondered and admired but never yet did I see or feel on their bosoms or on their banks unless proceeding from similar sourcesthe sources of philanthropyany thing so touching as the little scenery of an hour in and about the Chateau of Wel so true it is that  "An honest man's the  noblest  work of God"  But alas fortune according to her caprices is either the lavish fountain that feeds the stream of human benevolence or the stupendous and immoveable cataract that contracts its course and circumscribes its power Of our Prussian priest I have only further to say that every look word and action proved  "Large was his bounty and his soul sincere  And I have not a doubt that  "Heav'n has as large a recompense bestow'd  in the testimony of his own conscience  Friends he ought to have in abundance but he has gained one more while there is the breath of life in the Gleaner Nay I am willing  to extend the date of my gratitude towards him beyond the grave for if any thing that hath been done in this sublunary sphere is worthy to be remembered in another it is surely the fair deeds and authors of a generosity that is free from being polluted by the drossy materials of the present world If so what a claim has the unbought and unsullied act of this blameless priest on the memory of your friend when his powers of recollection shall be immortal Since the day on which I received the bounty I have not seen the benefactor but I often please myself by reflecting that my sense of his goodness will be amongst the sacred pleasures that I may reasonably hope shall not "quit me when I die"  We must not take leave of the Rhine till I have mentioned the amusement in reserve for you on the borders of that Imperial river The continual commerce and passage of people over the different ferrys of that as well as its neighbour the Maise is very diverting and though you sometimes seem in a country where if one of the villages was emptied of its inhabitants they would scarcely fill a boat you will perceive multitudes almost every half hour during the Summer pouring in shoals to the strand I was much  entertained in a ramble I made to the pretty village of Elton which is in the neighbourhood of Cleves and one of the most distinguished beauties of the Duchy part standing upon an almost Cambrianlooking mountain and part in a delightful valley It is situate on the other side of the Lower Rhine on passing which I found myself in the PontVolant Flyingbridgeboat with at least an hundred people the greater part of whom were singing hymns psalms and AveMary's in chorus Never did I behold such a collection of sorrowful countenances nor hear such a concert of solemn cries and I should have been justified in supposing the whole party to be mad had I not been told they were only penitential They were Prussian peasants come from their pilgrimage to Kaveler a village where I may use the word  millions  in speaking of the numbers which yearly receives the homage of the German people of all ranks and sexes It is the Mecca of this quarter of the globe The groupe in question were just come from a confession of their sins and were filled with compunction or with conscious absolution and as the first or last of these operated they were sunk to the dust with shame or treading in air with joy On their landing they formed themselves into two  bands singing in procession and with their hats off I gleaned them all the way from Elton in the vale to Elton on the Hill and never beheld so moving a curiosity Nevertheless a small circumstance happened that for a moment disconcerted the gravity of their progress In ascending the steep one of the penitents made a false step and came down in so unlucky a way that Religion herself must have smiled as indeed she did in the persons of those her sternest and perhaps truest votaries for there is a certain spark of waggery in human nature that can no more help the force of ridicule on the sight of a ludicrous object than hunger can resist appeasing appetite when the means are in its power And this fall was ludicrous enough being indeed an exposure of what has by proscription and by habit been long considered as the most ridiculous part of human nature at least the one that has been most subject and obnoxious to ridicule The poor penitent indeed would I believe have laught herself but that she looked on her fall as a judgement and so contented herself with doubling her AveMarias and continuing the procession with more zeal than ever  I will not trouble you with the long list of religious miracles believed to be wrought by  the Virgin in favour of the good Catholics that resort to Kaveler However great these may be the present race of French certainly have no faith in them but on the contrary when the armies of the Republic took possession of this place the plunder was not only carried to the holy altars but to the sacred figure itself The shrine was stripped of all its long collected treasures and as scarce any votary goes empty handed these were immense besides which a rigorous contribution was levied on the inhabitants an exorbitant supply of stockings boots shoes blankets muskets c for the army was insisted on the image of the Virgin was sacrilegiously polluted and that of the Saviour of the world very narrowly escaped the mock ceremony of the guillotine the modern Israelites however repeated their unhallowed practice which I think I have before mentioned somewhere of placing the red cap of licentiousness on its head and writing on its side as resolving to refuse even the Son of God his  title  Voila notre  Cidevant  Seigneur Behold he who was  formerly  our Lord His sacred head was ransomed at no small cost When this place was retaken by the Austrians the visits of congratulation and condolence drew together an almost incalculable multitude of supplicants from every quarter of the German  Empire Perhaps the devotion on that occasion must go into some excesses but I leave you to judge whether the extreme of penitence or of plunder is the evil most to be palliated  The day succeeding this I strolled some leagues farther into the country and being overtaken by one of those passing showers which in spring time collect drop and disperse almost in the same instant I took shelter in a roadside hut in which I caught the labourers just sitting themselves down to dinner There were thirteen persons including the maid servant who having set the food on the table took her chair amongst them Their repast consisted of nothing but one very large dish of potatoes for which they returned God both before and after eating as much possibly more thanks than he receives from many of his creatures on whom he bestows the richest delicacies of his creation It was truly a picture and a very beautiful one drawn by the faithful hand of nature of social happiness and religious decency for which the peasantry of Germany are remarkable amidst the heavy duties and toils of life I have only given you a single specimen of a universal and invariable practice  With respect to government all kings and high authorities will have at least an equal number of enemies and friends Of the former the present Prussian monarch has his share and yet as far at least as the interior regulation of his kingdom is concerned there seems very little just cause of complaint Where a standing army is enormous and perpetual there must be proportionate levies on some part of the people to support that division of the citizens that take up arms in protection of the rest Yet I know not the part of the earth where more liberty of speech or action is indulged than in the Prussian territories Political subjects are indeed forbidden but this as usual only gives edge to the desire of doing what is inhibited accordingly the monarch is  cut up  and  carved  at every public table in Prussia with as much freedom of abuse as even a modern patriot could well long for The ease with which the  little  folks appear to live notwithstanding the exaction of royal rights might be envied by the  great  folks of  any  nation Their houses and cottages are actually overstocked  crouded  with furniture and although there is little or no sotting in the common public houses each ordinary beerhouse I am convinced contains double the quantity of pots glasses china c which  would be necessary to equip an English kitchen In short the only miserystruck houses to be seen in Prussia or generally speaking in the German empire are those of the nobility and gentry in  declining  circumstances In their abodes indeed your generous heart would in vain seek for the comforts and accommodations of the peasantry Dismantled castles chateaus in decay without and nearly empty within tawdry beds time or motheaten tapestry rusty armories broken pillars and every sign of high birth in low circumstances are exhibited to your aching sight Yet the labour and difficulty with which the proprietors of these fragments endeavour to conceal these distresses is wonderful To such as have feeling hearts it is even pitiable They keep up the family carriage the family train of domestics and the family liveries which are overloaded with ornament and almost starve themselves to feed their vanity Hence on a going out day the magnificence of which is the oeconomy the almost famine of a month a passing spectator would mistake gaiety for happiness and grandeur as only a superfluity of wealth But never could it more truly be said that "all which glitters is not gold" All this inconvenience and indigence arises from the cruel necessity they are under to preserve the  ways  of men of  family without the  means  A Prussian gentleman may not consistently with ancestral dignity enter into any sort of profitable commerce to eke out a slender patrimony for trade though it might enrich the pocket is thought very much to impoverish the blood on which account these martyrs to family honours go half naked and more than half unfed And while the proprietors of a few miserable and mortgageeaten acres are starving upon their inherited pittance and are right honourably in want of the necessaries of life the plebeians who are not forbid to make their blood still poorer in order to preserve its purity may carry on all the gainful arts without any other loss than the chance of being starved upon principles of goodbreeding  The little Signiory of Boxmeer about seven leagues from Cleves and five from Nimeguen has claim to much of your attention It is singularly situated it is only a short mile distant from a part of Holland You have but to ferry across the Maise and you are in Prussia On the other side of a small hamlet you are in the dominions of the Emperor To the right and left about a league you are in two other distinct Signiories and in itself it is a principality so absolute that life and death is in the  power of the reigning Prince who is of the illustrious house of Hollenzollen and whose disposition makes his despotic power a mere shadow of authority for he is the parent of the people and they enjoy all the privileges of an happy Republic Yet even in this little well governed state there are patriots who have been once visited and plundered by the French yet who are still wishing the return of those ravages How unaccountable  The Boxmeer farmers cultivate a most beauful seed they call  sparcette  which yields two crops in the season and the after one is generally the best The verdure is more exquisite than any thing I have ever seen it resembles in figure our wheat when very young but surpasses it abundantly in colour The cows prefer it to grass and return for it most excellent butter  There are two Carmelite Convents in Boxmeer one of which is for women This latter I gleaned the other has nothing gleanworthy At the gate of the Convent for the men I met a gentleman with whom I had been formerly acquainted he appeared very pensive and begged I would defer my visit to the Convent till the next day and take my coffee at his  house I attended him On our way to his villa he told me that the object of his visit at the Convent was to converse with the superior on the subject of his niece who was to enter upon her noviciate the next day You remember Fanchette perhaps Sir the handsome girl whom on your former visit to this village you used to call the Boxmeer Blossom Her sister if you recollect had buried herself alive for you know my opinion on the subjectsome little time before you left usand tomorrow she finishes her career by taking the veil So that I shall lose both my domestic comforts for ever without any hope of seeing them again and you know how dear their company was to me especially since my son continues a profligate and has deserted meI was both affected and surprised at this intelligence for the Boxmeer Blossom was fresh in my remembrance and I recollect the regret with which I saw her sister pursue the fancy she had taken on enclosing herself This latter indeed was somewhat of a pensive cast and had if I may so say a bias to seclusion with the supposed incitement of a tender disappointment but the former was gay by nature even to excentricity and was addressed by the man of her heart with the sanction of her uncle who was both able and willing to unite fortune with love  On entering the uncle's house we were told by a servant that Fanchette was gone on a circuit to her neighbours to pay them her eternal adieus but left word that she should return to make her uncle's coffee She performed her promise with so much exactness that as the words  uncle's coffee  were pronounced she was almost in the act of pouring it out Her air had lost none of its pleasantry her features none of their beauty she was still the Blossom of Boxmeer  I will relieve you again from the irksome iteration of says I says he and says she by giving you our chat in dialogue  Uncle  I began to fear Fanchette that you would have been seduced from my coffee table on this alas last evening by some of your young companions  Niece  O fie how could you think so though every body asked me and on refusal would have accompanied me here but there was so much weeping and wailing about nothing that I really begged of them to stay at home  Gleaner  Nothing do you call it my Blossom to know one of their friends is going out of the world tomorrow morning  Niece  Ah ha Sir so you are come back Why really by all your regrets one would think I was already at the point of death and going to be buriedIt is as vain l'suppose to tell you as I have told others that I am going to be happier than I have yet ever been  Uncle  But is it not both death and burial  Gleaner  I ask the same question  Niece  And I make just the same answer that I have already done to hundreds but as you are resolved to have it so my death let it be I hope however Sir you will do me the honour to assist at my funeral I will present you with a ticket of admission to the ceremony And in the mean time as I have a great deal to do as you must consider all my worldly affairs are to be settled to night we must make haste and get the coffee over  Gleaner  What is yet omitted then I shall be sorry to lose your company  Niece  That's very obliging but you know that when I am to be buried in a few hours it takes some little time to prepare one's self  Soon after this she made her exit but in a few minutes came back to beg I would indulge  her with a moment's conversation in the garden I remember you perfectly said she and feel uncomfortable that you should imagine I treat lightly the act I am about to do but besides that from my very inmost soul I look upon as a festival what my friends call a funeral I love my uncle most dearly though he continues to oppose my happiness in the only point wherein it consists and as I cannot resist his tears though I can his arguments I have no other way but an apparent unconcern Comfort him therefore as the last favour I intreat of you persuade him to reconcile himself to my felicityand God preserve you  She hereupon gave me her hand and waving it so as to forbid reply went smiling out of the garden and sought her chamber  The next morning she rose the second in the house As I am usually the first of every family go where I will from a longindulged habit of "enjoying the cool the fragrant hour" we had another short  téteàtête  in which she informed me she had just come from taking an everlasting leave of a featherbed sheets and shift which were to be exchanged for very opposite pieces of furniture The ceremony of throwing away her dress cap and  all its  plumery  as a sign of her renouncing the vanities of the world was still to be performed as had previously been settled  Her deportment was more aweful than on the former day but her attempered air and sober step took nothing from her personal attractions  I soon lost sight of her on a promise to attend her in her last moments She said the necessity as well as the time of assumed vivacity was now past but that she felt a wish I should gratify my curiosity and again recommended her good uncle to my care observing that though he was too fond of the world he was one of the worthiest persons in it She then departed for the convent which indeed almost joined to her uncle's house and I found that the ceremony would begin in two hours  You will perceive that I had an interest in becoming witness to a scene like this and I feel while I write that you are not without a wish to receive a faithful Gleaning of it Depend upon it then in my next In the interval and always your wishes are mine  LETTER LXVII TO THE SAME  JUST as I was entering into reflections on the subject of my last and had brought myself to believe that every individual ought to be the architect of his or her own happiness seeing the ideas about it were as different as mens minds features and understandings the bereaved uncle came down stairs in deep mourning The idea of an interment had settled itself in his soul and he indulged it I could perceive he had been weeping and that it was not only the "customary suit of solemn black" which he had put on He took me by the hand after more than an hour's pause during which he either rocked himself up and down in his chaircover'd his face with his handor sighed heavily  It is amongst the solemn maxims of my life never to reason with a man in this kind of situation One may as well talk of sobriety to an intoxicated person as of patience and resignation or the folly of grieving to a mind overborne by sorrow The Conventbell arous'd him and still holding my hand his  own trembling as he spokeHark the poor Fanchette's funeralbell tollswe must be going I obeyed in silence A great multitude were waiting in the antichamber of the convent but by favor and by interest both which have their effect even in the temples devoted to those who have  renounced  the  world  we were immediately admitted into the gallery and obtained seats that commanded the chapel wherein the ceremony was to be performed Indeed our places were directly in front of the very part where the sisters were to take their station  Only two of the Novices were in the Chapel and those were strewing the floor with freshgathered flowers and evergreens and at that end of the apartment where the chief objects of the day were to be displayed was a large piece of green carpeting Soon after these preliminary preparations which have all their effect on the mind as tending to inflate curiosity the ceremonies of the entrance which were not a little imposing likewise began First came in the superior of the convent then the nuns according to their order and then the two sisters who were conducted by two sisters to a little altar in the centre of the room separated from the gallery  only by a slight and open partition Isabel so was the elder sister named was placed on the right and Fanchette on the left We had a complete view of both Each had a lighted taper in her hand and their headdresses were distinguished by the blue hood and the white There was enough of family similitude left in their features to discover their relationship It had been much stronger but the resemblance was in great measure diminished by their opposite situations in life Isabel had now been twelve months in a manner  out of the world  and in the practise of all the austerities of the Carmelite order and though these are not so rigid as some others the regulations they prescribe are more than sufficient to take out of the cheek that bloom which human society nature and the heart so liberally bestow upon youth besides which Isabel had something of a constitutional pale corresponding to the pensive colour of her mindif I may so express myself Fanchette on the contrary although she had yielded to a sentiment that determined her to devote herself had too recently taken her  leave  of the world and of the gay and freshning air it breathesin the country at leastand was moreover by disposition so impassion'd that the contrast betwixt her and Isabel was the  more striking The eyes of both were extremely dark but although those of Isabel were from the extinguished complexion of her cheeks more deep and perhaps more interesting than Fanchette's they were of a more subdued and dying lustre Fanchette's were "as the radiance of the risen day" and her sister's as the parting beam of a sun prematurely clouded even at noon  On their reaching the altar the superior of the men's convent addressed the two sisters in an exhortation replete with unaffected eloquence and to which they gave the most fix'd attention This done Isabel who was to take the veil arose and between two of the sisters came forward to make her profession which though in Latin was delivered with the most admirable articulation and classical propriety kneeling before the Priest Then followed the prayers appointed for the occasion  The Priest having laid the proper dresses of the order on a table before him assorted them Meantime the superior took off the white or noviciate veil and enrobed Isabel in black but over this under vestment was placed the white cloth cloak and the neck and head dress  of black linen A broad belt and the beads were then settled The Priest dipp'd a brush in holy water with which he sprinkled the Devotee and during this ceremony the most solemn airs were played on the organ in which the professed join'd apparently with her whole soul She was reconducted to her seat where she remained at her devotions while her sister underwent the ceremonies of the Noviciate These differ little from the other except that she was invested with the white head cloth instead of the black  But previous to the assumption of these she delivered a box to the Priest from which were taken the richest ornaments she had made use of while in the world The holy Father threw them on the floor with an air of disdain and with yet greater indignation Fanchette trampled them under her feet as objects unworthy her future attention In a former part of the ceremonials while her sister was putting on the eternal veil I observed that the before animated countenance of Fanchette became suddenly pallid but while she was renouncing these her worldly ornaments the blood sallied into her charming face as if to give  in  a more powerful evidence of her entire disavowal of all the pomps and vanities of  life And now succeeded several grand and truly spiritstirring chorusses of Priests Nuns and of the congregation High mass was next performed in the body of the convent below This pageant with all its priestly ornaments tingling of bells and the seducing apparatus of incense and of sacrifice are so well known and have been so well described by various authors that I shall pass on to more new and interesting objects Amongst these your heart will distinguish the two sincere and sorrowstruck lovers of these beauteous victims Both were present the one in the vain hope of prevailing on Fanchette even while at the altar to change her cruel resolution the other to attempt this also or at worst to enjoy the afflicting luxury of  seeing  this Isabel tear herself from his hope for ever not as I was informed without a faint idea of the possibility that the sudden sight of  him  whom she had once fondly loved might change her vow in these the last moments of her power to consecrate it to love instead of religion These young men were both of respectable connexions of decent fortunes and of blameless characters the name of Isabel's lover was Bernard and that of Fanchette Lacrew  They had both placed themselves so as perfectly to see but only one of them to be seen by the beloved object Lacrew relied upon an open attack and therefore kept constantly in view of the fair citadel Bernard conceived more hope from an ambuscade and therefore by way of masked battery entrenched himself behind a pillar on one side of the gallery from whence he could make a sortie at the moment he judged most favourable His motive for thus attempting to carry the place by surprise was strong he had been extremely ill and Isabel to whom a report had been made of it had reason to suppose  herself  the cause particularly as his sickness increased from the day that in reply to his strongest urgency to spare his life while yet in her power she had  refused  but confessed to a confidential friend that though she felt more emotion at the account of his distress than she  ought  to do she could not suffer him to work her from her pious purpose But the person who carried this account to him conveyed it in the  usual way of secrets  to another confidential friend who deposited it in  solemn trust also  to a third who with the  like sacred injunction  communicated it to Bernard himself and although this report at the time that it indicated some remains of  feeling for him denoted her resolution to seclude herself for ever from his sight by an act which as before observed would put it beyond her power to make him happy he conceived from it what cannot lovers imagine that since she was thus arous'd to some sensibility of his sufferings only at a  description  of them how would it be called forth at the unexpected  sight  of a once beloved and now agonized object whom she had every reason to suppose in his sick chamber at the distance of thirty leagues he resided at the farthest part of the country of Juliers and she had every reason to imagine he was unable to leave his room And so indeed except to accomplish an atchievement of  desperation  he was  But those who have ever felt the influence of the fairest hope in the moment almost of such desperation will not wonder that the poor Bernard in opposition to the advice of his medical and other friends and even of his own weakness at other times now found himself strong enough to leave an apartment wherein he had in a manner been bedridden several weeks and to throw himself not only into the open air but into an open postwaggon as they here call the publicstage and  which being without windows and undefended from wind or weather and very absurdly constructed is a  disease in itself  He gain'd the village of the convent it seems late in the evening that preceded the mornîng "big with the fate" of his heart yet that heart prompted him to take a moonlight view of the outside of the convent which contained his treasure He appear'd not to have suffer'd from these exertions or at least the suffrance and agitation  within  absorb'd every external disaster for the moment so true is the remark of our great master of human nature that  "When the Mind's free  "The Body's delicate"  and this unhappy lover might justly exclaim with old Lear in the storm  "The tempest in  my  mind  "Doth from my senses take all feeling else  "Save what beats there  "For where the greater malady is fix'd  "The lesser is scarce felt  Lacrew who lived in the village and was almost a next door neighbour had less occasion for stratagem and having had almost daily denials from his mistress was more reconciled even to the loss of her not without a mental resource however that he firmly believed a  woman of her disposition would soon sicken of a monastic life and that long before her year of trial had past she would return to the world and of course to him for she professed to love him better than any thing  in  that world yet she fancied something yet dearer to her  out  of it  Her lover indeed expected as he afterwards acknowledged to me and the uncle that she would even during the ceremonies of initiation find something in them too formidable for the gaiety of her character especially if he placed himself full in her view In this however he was mistaken His mistress had him almost the whole time under her eye but seldom looked towards him and when she did she withdrew herself with an haste and resolution that confounded and chagrined her admirer  The sisters having gone through the accustomed ceremonies rose from their kneeling attitude and retiring some paces back each threw herself with a determined earnestness but not in the mockery of tragic violence at full length upon the carpet and on their faces and had this falling scene been in rehearsal actually on the stage by the most expert tumblers and posture masters and  mistresses of the Theatre for six weeks it could not have been more adroitly perform'd Thus humbled to the ground they imprinted on it an audible kiss to express their lowliness of spirit and to signify they had renounced the lofty follies of the world to whose pomps and vanities they were henceforth dead the better to carry on which idea two of the nuns the one in her noviciate the other in her veil'd state toll'd the passingbell even while the bodies of the sisters thus symbolically buried alive were cover'd with a pall as if the breath of life was really gone from them  It was at this interesting and awful moment that the lover of Isabel broke from his concealment and shewed to the astonished spectators a countenance in which was painted every passion of the heart in despair but he did not speak  The burialservice was chanted to the notes of the organ which assisted by the vocal powers of the priests nuns c might be truly said to enter the spirit and elevate the soul It was impossible for an English auditor whom the Gods have made somewhat poetical not to apply to the occasion the beautiful description  of Pope and for an instant not to adopt the doctrine it inculcates  "O grace serene O virtue heavenly fair  "Divine oblivion of lowthoughted care  "Fresh blooming hope gay daughter of the Sky  "And faith our early immortality  "Enter each mild each amiable guest  "Receive and wrap me in eternal rest  The whole congregation were indeed extre  ly affected at this part of the ceremony I was touch'd even to tears As the veil'd Isabel rose her eye settled for an instant on Bernard who had pressed forward by this time through the croud and stood with his face directly parallel to his mistress who might be almost said to rise from the dead Considering circumstances he must to  her  appear in nearly the same situation and the sensation might have been something like what we may suppose affected William when Margaret's ghost stood at his feet  And now it was Isabel discovered that human nature was not yet extinct in her and that all the imagination of Pope was converted into truths which shook her frame and agonized her heart  "What means this tumult in a vestal's veins  "Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat  "Why feels my heart its long forgotten heat  "Yet yet I love"  These questions and this answer certainly succeeded each other in her bosom in the language of nature though not expressed in numbers  It was plain to see  "She had not yet forgot herself to stone"  Bernard was quicksighted enough in the midst of his grief to perceive this and attempted to turn it to his advantage Abelard himself could not with more address have "opposed himself to heaven" or more dexterously assisted "rebel nature to hold out half her heart" Though from what followed you will see Bernard had not like the abovementioned lover the power  "To teach her 'twas no sin to love"  it was manifest nevertheless  "Back through the paths of pleasing sease she run"  and it is no less certain for the instant that  "Not on the cross her eyes were fix'd"  but on  him  Yet though thus assailed by the unexpected view of as  she  thought an expiring lover  and at a time when every principle and every feeling of her soul had surmounted trials which required every  assistance  from surrounding objects rather than to find amongst them wherewithal to  distress  her in perhaps the only vulnerable parther pity for the misery of which she might well suppose herself the occasionalthough I say these strong events might for a short time  "Blot out each bright idea of the skies"  far from indulging in the oblivious draughts of passion or reiterating the loose imagery of Eloisa or avowing with her that  "From the full choir when loud Hosannas rise  "And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice  "Love found an altar for forbidden fires"  The transitory terror tenderness alarm or sorrow which she felt at the sight of poor Bernard at such a time in such a place might well claim absolution if not assent from the power who had just received her vows  "Devotion's self might steal a thought from heaven  "One human tear might drop and be forgiven"  She did not long however suffer the once dear object of her love to "dispute her heart" which assuredly a life past in chastity and innocence long before she dedicated it to her God had rendered more acceptable than that whose  supposed effusions the poet has so enchantingly poured forth  After she had gazed about half a minute in which short space more was painted in the face that at any former period of my life I had seen though the work of hours she clos'd her fine and humid eyes with a fortitude which might have induced the angels to sanction the momentary and human sympathy which had bathed them with tears but she was unable to repress one gentle sigh the weight of which was felt by my whole heart as it issued from her very lovely lips Whether it was the sigh tender or penitential the sigh of regret for the sufferings of her lover or of selfreproach for having allowed it to escapeit was the most graceful most penetrating I have ever known It will heave for ever in my memory and Isabel's face was on her rising from the ground so near me that I stood within the very breath of it Had I not frequently seen that the gayest minds and manners take with occasion a more firm and solemn cast than those from whose general gravity one  expects  the most fix'd and unmoved conduct I should have been surprised at the unaltered mein of Fanchette who though more airy more  ely an inhabitant of the world and who  "warm in youth had bid that world farewell"  her approved lover still before her exhibiting himself in the most pitymoving attitudes Fanchette relaxed nothing of her attention to the business or duty of the day On the contrary her look to Isabel denoted all the admonitory council which the moral echoes or as the Poet calls them  more  than echoes  "talk'd along the walls"  Eloisa could never have heard or fancy that she heard the hollow sound from the shrine more distinctly than I thought I perceived the  sense  of that sound in the charming features of this lovely girl  "Come sister come they said or seem'd to say  Thy place is here sad sister come away  Once like thyself I trembled wept and pray'd  Love's victim then tho' now a sainted maid  But all is calm in our eternal sleep  Here grief forgets to groan and love to weep  Ev'n superstition loses ev'ry fear  For God not man absolves our frailties here"  How applicable to the occasion Nor was it long ere Isabel as if these verses had actually been recited illustrated those which follow them in the celebrated epistle of the lovers of Paraclete  "I come I come prepare your roseate bowers  "Celestial palms and everblooming flowers  "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot c  Not so the loversBernard after a long struggle with his heart exclaimed in sad and broken accentsAh GodAh God and ran out of the convent nor was it long ere his example was followed by Lacrew  The ceremonies thus interrupted were soon resumed The sistervotaries were reconducted to their chairs where both joined in the prayers most devoutly  And now the holy wafers were given and the solemnities of the Catholic church in the sacrament began These ended the sisters rose kissed the robes of the priest bowed themselves before the Crucifix embraced each other then the superior the nuns noviciates and pensioners all of whom were received with smiles that seraphs seemed to have assisted while a dozen handsome girls residents for a convent education strewed flowers over them as they advanced to the last ceremony namely that of  crowning  emblematic of  that crown of glory  with which we are assured the good are to be distinguished in the world to come  By way of supplementary matter it is to be noted that the ceremony was performed on the birthday of the veiled sister a circumstance  that gave it additional solemnity The rest of this aweful day was past agreeable to custom in all manner of innocent festivity by way of testifying that so far from feeling any regret for having renounced the world the sensations were in unison with the ceremonies and indeed had it not been for the affair of the heart in the cases of the two luckless lovers I should believe that custom and example had their usual effect in conjunction with zeal and imagination to make a monastic life preferable to every other in the estimate of the inhabitants of the convent What confirms me the rather in this is that the year following being at the selfsame monastery I beheld the selfsame Fanchette after her twelve probationary months' residence volunteer the same sort of ceremony and with the same apparent satisfaction and though she had lost some of those complexional roses which seem to bloom best in the world she had gained more of those lillies which never fail to grow in the cheeks of a nun either from seclusion or severity or a mixture of both There was an air of peculiar content in Fanchette at this  confirmation  of the choice she had made in the beginning of the former year nor was there less satisfaction in the countenance of Isabel in short the most scrutinizing eye might have assured  the heart these two sisters in changing their plan of life had only varied not diminished their happiness  On bidding them as probably it will prove an everlasting adieu at this second visit to their convent I borrowed once more an applicable passage from our great poet and I cannot but believe every line found its echo in the minds of the beautiful devotees Nor do I think since the epistle of Eloisa was written there can have happened such an exact illustration of its best and most interesting sentiments since in the sister nuns were demonstrated all the spirit the softness and the beauty of Abelard's mistress without any of her cupidity sensuality and libertinism and the exquisite apostrophe which follows was the work only of fancy in Eloisa but of feeling in Isabel and Fanchette  "How happy is the blameless vestal's lot  "The world forgetting by the world forgot  "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind  "Each pray'r accepted and each wish resign'd  "Labour and rest that equal periods keep  "Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep  "Desires compos'd affections ever even  "Tears that delight and sighs that waft to heav'n  "Grace shines around her with serenest beams  "And whisp'ring angels prompt her golden dreams  "For her th' unfading rose of Eden blooms  "And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes  "For her the spouse prepares the bridal ring  "For her white virgins hymeneals sing  "To sounds of heav'nly harps she dies away  "And melts in visions of eternal day"  Since my first idea of poetical excellence my senses and my heart have attested the beauty of this passage and indeed of the whole poem but never has it been so impressive as since the abovedescribed incidents  Amidst the whole however of the fascination I could not but notice a small spice of worldly vanity in certain parts of the ceremony such as one of the  poor lowly  brothers being appointed to place the embroidered robes of the  High  Priest over the  backs of the chairs  to give them a more graceful flow as the wearer sat down I observed also methought something of earthly pageantry lurking in the  caution  with which the female veil whether white or black was  fixed before  and  folded behind  as well as in the attention to graceful posture with which the professed threw herself on the carpet for though as I before said it did not partake of the nature of a theatrical exhibition it had the air of having been a little studied because it was impossible  not to see that some care had been taken that the vestal garment might preserve an interesting negligence but when we consider that the same kind of regard to attitude and position was betrayed by the dying Pompey we may certainly allow it to two fine young women who gave up  for ever  the conquests of their charms at a period of life when victory most solicited them And after all their attentions to external finery were but the  ashes of human vanity  a few remaining sparks that just shewed themselves and were then extinguished for ever  The cost of the festival is always defrayed by the nun or novice and the friends relations and a few chosen priests from the neighbouring convent composed the guests To this eating and drinking scene a little masquerade in which all the nuns are allowed to assume borrowed characters ensues This done the guests retire such I mean as are not of the convent The religious withdraw to their cells and the next morning recommence those duties which know no recess throughout the revolving year till a similar occasion produces a similar jubilee  It was a sad and sorrowful day for the uncle of these sisters he endured not to remain in an house stripped of its chief ornaments and associates and which had the further  désagrément  of standing as before noted in full view of the convent which he considered as at once the prison and the tomb of his relations In a few weeks therefore he removed to another part of the country where he still bears about  "A discontented and repining spirit"  But such an effect might naturally enough arise from such a cause Far very far from both be the bosom of my friend  LETTER LXVII TO THE SAME  ADJOINING the little signiories of Boxmeer is the pleasant country of Cuych  Herman de Cuych gave name to this country in John the son of Wennemaer yielded it long after in exchange of other territories to William of Guelderland but at length the Dukes of Burgundy becoming proprietors they united it to Brabant After this again it was given as a pledge to the Count of Buren whose only daughter and heiress married William of Orange in Thus it was that the charming Caych country became annexed to the possessions of the Prince Stadtholders  a small but productive territory once in the possession of Spain but now a part of what is  called the Generality a country subject to the Prince of Orange and an object worth gleaning It may be about the size of Hertfordshire and is like that replete with unpretending graces You would feel its resemblance to England even more closely than the other parts of Westphaliathe same pleasant pathways meandring through cornfieldsthe same soft pasturagemodest risingshumble and flowery hedgerowsthe woods and copses filled with the same kind of birdsthe river Meuse no less fertilising than the Thames nor less beautiful the same sort of whited cottages moss and houseleek growing over the thatch  If a footpath and riverbank traveller is disposed occasionally to survey this country he will find a thousand beautiful scenes which crouds had never yet to boast  It is extremely pleasant to trace as one journeys on these similitudes and dissimilitudes of one's native land here recognising in certain objects our old acquaintance there paying in others our first salutation to entire  strangers and whether these happen to be of the vegetable or animal world a tree a flower a wood a meadow a stream a river a flock an herd a cottage or its inhabitants the generous heart extends to greet whatever has delighted him at home or entertained him abroad  In turning over a little corner in my travelling writingcase I find a small bundle of papers superscribed materials for a  scrap letter  which is to consist of various minute Gleanings too insignificant to stand alone but which collected and tied together may be of some value After the  long  ears of corn have been gathered you have seen the patient Gleaners return from the field with a few handsfull not of stem or substance to be bound with the rest of the sheaves and yet too good to be lost  To these minutiae therefore I shall consecrate the remainder of the present letter desiring you will indulge them with the favour by which you have distinguished the rest  In Holland Westphalia Germany and their dependencies it is customary for the common tradesmen and servants to drop their sabots slippers or shoes at the threshold of  the apartment where their employers masters or mistresses are sitting and pad along with a trembling sort of circumspection as if in fear of leaving a plebeian mark of their footsteps behind them And at every word you speak their hats whether in the house or the open air are so painfully doffed and pinched by their veneration or their custom that I have a thousand times smilingly put their hats on their heads and requested they would consider a good rub of their shoes at the doorway was a sufficient passport to any room wherein they might be introduced to me but the habit or civility is inveterate and I verily believe they would pay the same homage to the empty apartments had they occasion to enter them in absence of their supposed superiours I repeat that I am no advocate for indiscriminate familiarities nor for Republican rudenesses but I love the poor at least as well as the rich and I feel myself as an individual of a majestic species humbled in  their  degradation I would have them subordinate because I think society demands its classes but I cannot endure they should be servile and after all it is often affected for sometimes I have at a second or third Gleaning of these bowing bareheaded and footed gentlemen and ladies found heard of seen them as saucy proud and vainglorious  as if they knew how to descend from their heights only to promote their interests in the hope of overreaching you in a miserable sous or stiver  In each of the above countries you will be obliged as before observed to have one man to dress the hair on your head my good reader and another if peradventure thou art of the bearded sex to scrape it from thy face But the last mentioned personage whom they call surgeon is every where so insufferably vain formal and  mal adroit  that a penny barber in England does his business ten times better and twenty times more expeditiously The Continental shaver whether Dutch Westphalian or German is one quarter of an hour bringing his instruments of surgery out of his pocket and arranging them another in the apparatus of wipeing whetting setting and proving upon his hand before he puts the razor on your chin another in the operation and at least the fourth quarter in putting his surgical matters up again and all this you must go through patiently or worse will follow every resistance costs you a drop of blood remonstrance is not even listened to and a request of haste is a slice from your chin or a gash in your throat I have had more reason to bewail a nervous  complaint that shakes my hand since I came into these countries than ever I certainly mangle myself deliciously whenever I attempt to atchieve this daily labour myself but I yield to the pedantry of these executioners only because I consider being murdered by the hand of another is better than shedding my own blood as it is less heinous you know to suffer assassination than to commit suicide  Seriously it is a most provoking and clumsy operation abroad and I have as often wished myself beardless as I might once have wished the contrary And as to any  consideration  that the head or face these surgeonbarbers have in hand is human a butcher who might chuse to shave the chops of a bullock before he slaughtered it would be more gentle Your barbersurgeon pinches you by the nose with as little remorse as a farrier draws the nippers round the nostrils of an horse he squeezes your head as if he was binding up your brains after a contusion and holds back your neck as if he was going to cut your throat which indeed he generally does in proof of his great powers of pharmacy In a word blessed are those ladies who happen to have no beards and happy those ladies or gentlemen who when they travel can operate upon themselves  In almost every great road town upon the German Continent you will find an English shop where you may be supplied with English manufacture There is a very excellent one at the Hague kept by Mr M'Queen which may almost be termed an  universal warehouse of British commodities  It is true you pay somewhat high for these but you are to consider first their superior excellence secondly the hazard loss and expence of their transportation and thirdly it should be noted that as the Dutch and German customers buy almost every thing  for life  that is make an expensive article last as long as  they last themselves  and pay bills about once in ten years when they condescend to pay at all for no tradesman dare send in his bill  undemanded  if articles were not highly rated an English trader abroad must starve  It is observable that the inns abroad kept by Englishmen or people who speak our language are dearer than those kept by natives about fifty per cent and it is remarkable also that the English landlords overreach their countrymen more than a stranger See you avoid them There are at least six Scotchmen and three Irishmen to one trader English born dispersed over foreign lands  the first  thrive  the  second live  the third  barely exist  Can you account for this The  truth  of the remark reaches from one end of the Continent to the other with scarce an exception I think I have found out the reason but it might seem invidious and a prejudice to mention it  There subsists in some parts of Holland a curious circumstance respecting divorcesan husband who is desirous to obtain repossession of either an eloped parted or wandering wife is to send a written summons to her inviting her company to bed and board if she refuses he is to go in a boat on the river Meuse to any distance he pleases then he is to call the said wife three several times and if he receives no answer or if she does not appear he is to come back as fresh and fair a batchelor as before he purchased the wedding ring and is at liberty to choose another mate whose hand he may accept after the publication of the banns and marriage ceremony The truth of this almost incredible story is too general to be disputed by any body but those who cannot believe what they have never seen And yet there are numbers of my dear countrymen who will suppose it a Gleaning of the author's imagination To which I shall only reply that in the small town of the Brielle in Holland  here are not less than half a dozen couples who have been thus remarried  But as a celebrated traveller Lady W Montague justly observes we travellers are in very hard circumstances If we say nothing but what has been said before us we are dull and we have observed nothing If we tell any thing new we are laughed at as fabulous and romantic not allowing for change of company or of customs that happen every twenty years in every country or remain fixed for ever though perhaps not before noticed The ceremonies attending visitings and burial condolences deserve mention In Prussian Westphalia a letter is sent by the survivor informing the friends of the deceased that such a relation has departed this life but it is the etiquette  not to reply  Your sympathy is taken for granted and thus the affair is not only conveniently shortened but a great deal of trouble is saved to both parties  With respect to visits it is the established punctilio for new comers to make the first advances to residents exactly inverting the etiquette of England and the reason assigned for this practice is that new settlers may have the privilege of declining company should  they not wish for society or of extending or narrowing it should they desire acquaintance your visit being always returned immediately and if you do not visit in the course of the first month it is presumed you prefer solitude  Perhaps this may be an improvement on the plan of England where every one has free liberty to gratify curiosity often at the expence of real courtesy for numbers go once for a wellbred stare drink their dish of tea and shew they have had enough of you by never cultivating you unless you happen exactly to suit their taste which is often the result of their singularity or caprice Whereas in these countries you have leisure for previous enquiry you can select your acquaintance and if it is not of the best kind the place affords it must be your own fault  Another inconvenience attending your not being fortified with the language of the country whether Dutch or German is the imposition you are liable to especially on leaving a town or house where you may have had any running accounts The people you have dealt with pretend to understand  you  fully when you  make  your bargain but when you come to collect your bills they protest that you have mistaken  them  and this errour is always to their advantage  For instance you agree with a surgeonbarber at so much per month to shave you and with a shoeboy to clean your boots c You reasonably conclude the price settled between you includes every thing but at the end of the month you are charged so much for putting soap on the face and so much for taking it off so much for rubbing away the dust from your shoes and so much again for blacking them Let it be clearly stated therefore that in your country shaving and shoe cleaning mean what they express  The price of timber in Westphalia and the countries that environ it is amongst the things calculated to surprise an English traveller A noble fir of between thirty and forty years growth is thought rather dear at six florins about ten shillings English and an oak of more than half a century is rated at about twelve or at the most fifteen shillings Inferior wood in proportion The birch tree is here found in abundance and contributes much to the beauty of the country drooping with an air of poetical melancholy almost with as much elegant sadness as the weeping willow The natives of Westphalia tell you that the juice is good to drink the foliage good to see and the branches good to burn they seem no less sensible than ourselves also that the twigs  have other virtues chiefly adapted for the use of nurseries and schools  Simple curiosity is alike in all countries You remember the account I sent you in my first sheaf of the astonishment of an whole family of Cambrian rustics at the sight of a shining steel watchchain I found a companion for this picture of  wonderment  in the surprise of some Westphalia cottagers who surveyed a common bamboo stick with as much attention and awe as if it was a wand of enchantment and feeling the knots with a trembling hand as if there was magic in every joint  You will be pleased to hear the  universal  reputation which is enjoyed by the manufactures of your country I think I slightly glanced at this subject before Whatever is English becomes every where abroad an object of admiration I have witnessed this in various instances but in none more than in the rhapsody which the sight of three pair of English shoes produced in an honest cobler of a little town in Prussia  These articles neat as imported from London lay upon my table just unpacked as this  child of nature entered my room to receive orders for a trifling repair in my boots He incontinently caught up one of the shoes and for some minutes was too much absorbed in wonder to speak He turned the shoe about in silent admiration felt the sole which his  look  denoted was of the best leather possible examined the stitching the form the elegance the solidity the simplicity the lightness the straps the quarters sitted it to his hand as he did which he shewed signs of the most perfect approbationthen by way of comparison held it down to his own shoe and  as  he did so gave testimony of the most inessable contempt even for his own performance which was perhaps the highest compliment that could be paid to the performance of another His features and action had actually all the force of Hamlet's parallel of the old Fortinbras his father and the usurper  "Look but on this picture and on this c"  His phisiognomy testified that  his  work was no more to compare to the British Crispin's  "Than he to Hercules"  It was long before he could attend indeed to any thing respecting himself and after his rhapsody subsided a little he seemed to undertake  even the cobbling art of taking up a few loose stitches in an  English boot  with reluctance  Nor does our country triumph in this handycraft fame without the bestfounded pretensions since in every article of workmanship we cast them at a distance that rather gives the sensation of despair than energy Doors windows their ornaments their necessaries their comforts their finishing their application their fitness their buildings their elegance all yield the palm to the superior arts of the British artificer And if there is a general rule without an exception I am from very long and diligent scrutiny inclined to think it lies in the unrivalled excellence of our manufactures in the comforts and conveniences of life  You have heard numberless anecdotes of the late Prussian monarch A stronger idea of his insatiable military ambition cannot be well given than in his exclaiming to one of his officers while surveying the prospect from his chateau at Cleves "very fine to be sure noble woods pretty gardens fair towns wellfilled rivers and all that but I can never think it a good prospect while any part of the objects it includes is the property of another sovereign"  I will just note to you that amongst the pictures of this chateau is a very fine one of Jesus and the virgin and on the reverse a full length portrait of the painter himself suspended in the middle of the room to shew at once the genius and the vanity of the man  Of the German Theatre I have little to observe farther than that it excels in  passion  You must have often noted the defect of the English actors I speak generally when not immediately in discourse or action in the scene They seem to think that their character comes to a pause at the end of every speech and they wait for the cue words to resume it these are no sooner given than they kindle in a moment They wait the match and go off like a cracker Then all is dead and inert till the other personages have settled the business in hand whether an affair of love hate hope or despair nor does the passive character they are speaking to ever interrupt the progress of these passions or shew any sensibility thereof except by stepping a pace back or a pace forward by a stamp of the foot a thump of the breast or a smack of the foreheadBut on the Theatre Allemande all is life vigour and ardency yet rarely overstepping the modesty of nature and the bye play is so skillfully  managed that where the poet himself sleeps the vigilance of the actor guarantees his nap without any diminution of his poetical fame  I am aware that this is the case sometimes in the British theatre but it is more rare and commonly speaking Homer himself could not there nod had Homer been a dramatist without some of the performers slumbering with him and causing the audience to slumber also  High however as they estimate the manufactures of Great Britain the untravelled Prussians and Germans appear to have but a very confined idea of its extent for in the first place many of them imagine that it is rather necessity than choice rather policy than curiosity which takes such numbers out of England They believe the population is too great for the place that  our  little country being overstocked the superflux wander about the earth in search of  more room  Almost every person tells you he knows an Englishman that is to say in the course of his life every man has met with one of the British wanderers or some solitary family resident abroad The Germans immediately presume  this person or family must be known also to  you  If you answer in the negative they wonder which certainly implies a contracted idea of Great Britain as a territory however they may think of it as a nation  The Germans bring up their children with great tenderness but in a manner to prevent the effects of effeminacy or the ordinary ailments proceeding therefrom I have seen the sons and daughters of gentlemen run through the dews of the morning without shoes stockings or any under garments but shirts and shifts chacing each other round the court yards gardens c in this  almost  natural state after a night of incessant rain About noon when there seems the less real necessity to wrap up they begin to  put on  just in the proportion as other children  throw off  but they all look as healthy as if they were educated in the way of England The mothers of Great Britain will shudder at this relation yet could the custom be reconciled with decency which surely were easy it might deserve adoption Colds and coughs which are not only bad disorders in themselves but the parents of worse in England are rarely heard of along the continent of Germany And after you have turned your back on Holland the gout begins to  lose his excruciating power till in advancing further north he is in a measure subdued at least a victim bound hand and foot by this tyrant who hourly brings so many of my compatriots to the rack is rarely seen Must we not impute this general exemption from one of the sharpest pangs to which our frailty is heir to early exposure of the body and limbs to all the skiey influences  I think I have not yet mentioned the mode of serving at table in Holland and Prussia Vegetables are eaten first no person offers to begin till all are helped meat comes next this is cut into very thin slices in a plate and passing round the table every one receives or declines If a second third fourth or fifth sort of meat is on the board there are as many platesfull sent round itthe servant watches your glass filling it when empty the bread is cut into exceeding thin slices and no healths are drank except at parting  An elegant English family settled in Holland has lately given a  Dutch drum  or route of which the lady of the house has favoured me with a description As it is well told and a curiosity in itself I will here present you with a Gleaning and in her own words  "Dear Mr Gleaner  "At your desire I am sitting down to give you a description of what is called in this country a  contre visite  That I might accommodate to the customs of the place I invited the assistance of a good natured Dutch neighbour who helped me through all the ceremonials And being no less a personage than the Burgomaster's wife she was wholly competent to the business I shall write in way of general direction as to what is to be done c c  "Two of the largest rooms in the house are always appropriated to the occasion the better if they communicate as is indeed usual abroad but that is not material Card tables are to be set in the four corners of each room the middle being kept perfectly clearthe place of honor is always determined to be on the right hand side of the pier glass From each side of this glass you are to place two rows of chairs with a square box called a stove at the foot of each chair and if in winter you are to take care these stoves are well supplied with burning turf or rather with the live ashes of turf and if in summer the fire is to be omitted as a Dutch woman is too much in the habit of canting up her legs on these abominable little footstools to sit  comfortably without them and in the cold weather she could neither use her hands or arms without smokedrying her feetBy the gentlemen's seats you place spitting boxes and as if these would not hold enough a dozen or two of spitting pots are to be set on the side tables or to grace the corner of the card equipage several slates and pencils are also to be provided All the plate you can muster is to be crouded on the grand sideboard and at least an hundred tobacco pipes with tasteful devices wrapp'd about them not forgetting half a dozen pound boxes of tobacco with a suitable service of stoppers  "These preparations being settled you are ready to receive the company who begin to appear at your Dutch drum about  five in the afternoon  The  reigning  burgomaster's wife enters first You are to receive her at the door after a good run to meet her by way of testifying your joy with a dead stop and you are to take care that your curtsey is at least as profound as hers the better if a little deeper And if you would adopt the fashion of this country you should revive one of your boarding school sinkings at the commencement of a minuet or one of your school reverences to your governess on leaving the room You are  to take her by the hand you are to say you are extremely honoured by the visit and then  kiss her three times  Then lead her to the right hand side of the glassorder a burning redhot stove to be put under her petticoatsthe genteeler if you condescend to place it yourselfand then receive the rest of the company  stoveing  them and  kissing  in the same manner more carefully however  placing  them according to their  rank in the town or village  than if they were so many British peeresses to be settled by the High Steward at the trial of a sister peeress for high Treason When all the chairs are filled you may order refreshments  "In the first place tea is to be presented three times round the room This over the card tables are to be arranged the stoves refreshed the pipes lighted and the spitting boxes begin to work You are to present  four kings  to the burgomaster's wife and the three you mean to play at her table To the next lady in her rank you present the  queens  But make a memorandum that when once seated nobody stirs from her table till the party breaks up at ten o'clock so that you are fixed as a statue for almost five hours The refreshments are to be handed about every  quarter of an hour  but  to vary as to the collations One quarter gives coffee another wine another liquors another orgeat and at every time the company eat and drink with unabated appetite and those who offer the most good things of this world are made the most honorable mention of in the annals of  contre visitism  The ceremonies of taking leave are like those of entrance  "It is to be observed that when you give one of their visits it is not from your own invitation the reigning burgomaster sends you word if convenient he will come to you such a day If you accept the challenge you are to send off your cards in which you invite  the town  to meet him who very obligingly obey the summons whether they ever saw you before or no or whether they shall ever see you again  "All the smoking party keep their own room but leave such a strong sense of their orgies behind them that it is necessary your house if your nose is not a native of Holland should perform a quarantine of a month before it can be purified  "A  contrevisite  seldom includes supper but when a supper is to be given in Holland it  always comprehends cards and tea with the immense et cetera of about eight times coffee as many cakes wines jellies c c c and supposing these to begin at half past five and supper to be on table at half past ten though the intermediate hours are fully employed in eating and drinking it does not in the least prevent the supper being devoured as King Richard voraciously says "marrow bones and all" for though in general life at  home  the Dutch eat but little of solid food they pay it off  abroad  with most incontinent rapacity Indeed they seem like certain wild beasts in training for the grand gorging day when they are to be turned out upon criminals to reserve themselves for these great public occasions and a Dutch supper at the end of five hours stuffing might very well furnish out one of our Lord Mayor's feasts and satisfy all the mansionhouse monsters on any one of the important days  "Big with the fate of Turkeys and of Geese"  By way of specimen I shall conclud  a Dutch Bill of fare of which I made a N B in my pocketbook immediately on getting home from the last crammingbout to which I had the honour of being invited I shall only premise  that we were only persons at table MemIt was a supper  TOP  A very large fillet of veal  bak'd  and forc'dmeat ba'ss  Stew'd  ndi    An immense sallad  A forc'd pike of lb weight  Pan full of stew'd Pears  boil'd in the shell  Plumb pudding  Yard wide pye of all meats birds and beasts  Pan full

Sorrel  BOTTOM  N B Nothing left but the large bones and plates  To which pleasant but faithful description I shall only ask with the Poet  "Is this a supper this a genial room  "No it's a temple and a hecatomb"  "Treated caress'd and tir'd I take my leave"  There are dispersed over the provinces of Holland of Prussia and of Germany various towns bourgs and villages which amongst other privileges possess that of affording protection to fugitives for debt and there are some which offer an asvlum even for crimes Of these Vianne Cleves and Neuweid may be mentioned amongst others They are either free towns or independent se gneuries The former have usually taken their rise from the exigence of the state which has often made the Prince a borrower of t  e people The Emperors frequently wanting supplies of money to carry on their wars or for other occasions have hir'd large sums of great trading towns and paid the debt in certain extra grants privileges and immunities making them independent of the governors of the provinces or districts where those towns stood or in their neighbourhood Accordingly such places remain free exercising all kinds of sovereign power with the right of enacting laws constituting authorities courts of justice and coining as well as of offering a sanctuary to strangers debtors c cI am sorry to inforth you that this latter privilege is not seldom made a revenue of the town or the seigneur or a perquisite of office But it must  be owned the fee is not largea guinea or two for instance per person which makes your person sacred beyond limitation provided nevertheless you conform peaceably to the laws of the land where you establish your residence which it is certainly not only decent but easy to do as they are no way rigorous in themselves and the protected places are for the most part situated in a fine country  Vianne for instance is built on the banks of a fine river on the confine of the beautiful province of Utrecht nearly half way betwixt Rotterdam and Nimeguen It remains possessed of all rights of Seignieurship independent of Holland It is supposed to be the Fanum Dianae of which Ptolemy makes mention  The towns and villages of the Dutchy of Cleves already live in my description and I trust in the reader's memory And should misfortune find it necessary to take refuge in either of these he will pass his days or years of exile amidst the beauty and health of nature  With respect ot Neuwied independent of giving  "The poor and the unhappy  "A privilege to enter"  it has claims on our attention being one of the most agreeable towns and placed in one of the most charming countries of Europe The account of it is sufficiently popular but the best Gleaning of it is by the author of the journey or rather voyage of the Rhine a work I have already commended  "It is in this town says he that the writer of these pagesa victim of French despotism has found refuge honour and happiness after having been despoiled of livres and driven from a country that was dear to him It is in this free and sacred land he at length is permitted to reside in peace with his rescued family And here also it is that he announces a virtuous Prince and a gentle race to philosophers men of letters and of humanityto peaceable citizens and to ingenious artiststo honest labourers and to the worthy of all descriptions who like him may be expelled from the scenes of rapine and desolation"  The gratitude of this author for the protection he received has not seduced him into effusions of praise which exceed the truth The sweet sejour of Neuweid merits all he has said of it It is situated on the borders of the  Rhine betwixt Bonne and Coblentz The country is agreeable the inhabitants sociable and the air wholesome Vines and orchards surround it Hills and vallies smile on every side The water is particularly excellent the corn good and abundant Butcher's meat in all its variety and a no less plenty of vegetables fruit fish fowl and game Lodgings are reasonable and elegant The prime of every commodity from the famous fairs of Bonne Coblentz Mayence and Francksort as well as from Holland are to be had at Neuwerd as they can come by water to your very door And to crown the whole the reigning prince is a man of politeness urbanity genius peace and benevolence He is descended from one of the most honourable and ancient house  and what is better he is in every sense of the term an HONEST MAN Of the prince of his family and of his palace of MountRepose two leagues from Neuweid a thousand fine things have been said by the ingenious writer abovementioned but after what I have just termed him would not all these go to an anticlimax  "An honest man's the noblest work of God"  Amongst the objectionable things which an English traveller will find in Prussia Westphalia  and through all the Catholic countries is the frequency of holydays feasts fasts and fairs  I would have every creature adore his Creator according to the customs of his country and resort to the places of worship as often as his piety inclines But I cannot fail to regret that the church should exact an observance of mere ceremonies which trench on the duties of social life being convinced that a performance of these is a part of religion It is the result of reiterated observation that enables me to assure you nearly the half of a servant's and labourer's time is taken up in the churches and very frequently made the pretext for a neglect of necessary business and indeed promotes idleness I have always noted that the most church going people in this country are the worst domestics the most supine and the most superstitious How it happens I know not but religion in this country seldom works the blood into enthusiasm the being righteous overmuch in Germany more commonly produces a moody torpid stupidity Methodists and other fanatic sectaries are rare These bodies amongst us produce you know ebullitions of zeal that ferment to distraction It is  in England a raging madness in the German dominions a gloomy melancholy and with respect to society the latter is a the evil most to be lamented The first is a violent fit and passes soon away and though the returns of the paroxism are quick the intervals admit of some activity in secular affairs But the German malady after sending a man from his honest employments his master and his family two or three days in the week without counting Sunday continues him in a kind of religious apathy all the rest of the year On the holydays it is with great difficulty a cook will dress dinner or a chambermaid toss up the beds If you want bread it must be made and baked the day before to put an hand in the oven would be sacrilege and to fetch a pail of water an offence laid up amongst others for next confession The consequence of all this is that after they have run in and out of the church till they are weary you will see them in lazy circles stand about the streets with folded arms and gapeing mouths or sleeping in their houses kitchens c At intervals however they wake to the recollection of the Saint in whose honour the fete is instituted and renew their aspirations It is common to hear them break forth in the midst of any ordinary  occupation even during the few days their religion suffers them to work into an hymn or spiritual song I once past some months in an house where a peasant servant to his other businesses added that of a barber and under whose razor being in a small country place I came almost every day He had been used on my first employing him only to reap the chins of the rustics and any thing that could cut stubble would answer that purpose for besides that it is the general practice for the gentry of Germany of shave only once aweek a German chin after it  has  been shaved would turn the edge of a Dutch razor When the man therefore came upon a face that called for daily scraping and found it had been used to gentle usage he looked upon it as so arduous an undertaking that he called in all the might of his religion to strengthen his arm and incontinently retired into a little chapel adjoining the house both before and after the operation first for going through his job with judgment and then in thanksgiving for having performed it without cutting my throat On these occasions he always sung two staves of the same psalm and with so much violence of lungs that one would think he imagined heaven would be deaf to his  prayers Indeed I often thought so too for not withstanding his bawling if my chin and throat came off with no more than half a dozen flashes the blood gushing at each I reckoned it a morning of escape But this fellow would sometime burst forth into a musical howl at mealtime with the meat in his mouth and yet having a few acres of ground now and then to reap and mow also if too much sun or rain or from or snow thinned his crops be would be as full of growl against the good God of seasons as if the werea French Republican  Fairs or what they call Kermisses are very proper supplements to their fasts and holydays not that those are more numerous than in England but because it is the custom for the servants to visit every kermis at whatever distance where she or they have a friend or relation and as each kermis lasts a week and as it is thought very hard if the permission is not given for at least a couple of days at each you may guess in what a situation families are lest betwixt one practice and another If by accident you call on a friend and stay dinner the cook is gone to the kermis or to the church or else it is a fastday and she can do  nothing but drink coffee  eight or ten times  and go to the kirk  Yet a kermis particularly a village one is worth seeing It is an annual association of all the scattered parts of a man's family and friends I attended one in Westphalia on a principle of that general curiosity which carries me every where But having no village connexions while at Cleyes I wandered about a little place in the neighbourhood during kermis time The first joyful groupe which I saw gathered together arrested my step I stood leaning on the gate of a large farm yard at the farther end of which I observed a number of persons sitting round a table and others dancing and almost every body singing The first glympse of a stranger brings an invitation especially on public occasions This urbanity is almost universal in Westphalia I followed a courteous introducer who led me to the master and mistress of the house Their testimonies of welcome came so fast upon me that had I eat and drank of half the different good things which were set before me I must have been  killed with kindness  on the spot I soon understood that I was at the house of a farmer whose happy family from great grandfather to  grandchild were amongst the guests and all these different characters on the stage of human life were dancing on a grass plat behind the great barn and all such as were or had been married arrayed in their bridal dresses One of the brothers' wives introduced a sackling of two months to the greatgrandfather who was enjoying health in the sight of four and thirty relations and in the Syth year of his age It was a  benquet  for a good natured spectator to see the joy with which the old man danced the little creature on his knee then presented him to the other parts of his family according to seniority that the youngling might have a  kermisskiss  from all his kindred But the pretty mother How I wish that you had seen the mother during this transactionnot on account of her prettiness but because the finest blushes that ever circulated from the heart into the countenance and the softest tears that maternal fondness ever brought into the face of a lovely young woman would then have been enjoyed by my friend and it was her first child and it had been a match of love and the babe according to its parents wish was a son and according to family wishes also it bore the name of its greatgrandsire and was thought by affection who  takes likenesses you know in a moment to inherit the hue of the eyes and some of the features The attitude half bending over it in its circuit as it passed from the arms of one relation to those of another was a subject for painting and might have been highly finished but the extacy in which at the end of the ceremony she received and the kisses with which she covered it were beyond the reach of human pencil and required all the powers of nature who works in colours "dipt in heaven" After this every body drank health and many more happy  family fétes  to the old man who in return pledged a bumper of Rhenish to the company one of the sons assured me that the veteran's maladies were slight and always cured by a visit to one or other of his family His medical son  prescribed  this affectionate remedy thus when his own home became a little solitary the good old man went to another and as all the family live within a short distance from the ancient mansion of this their forefather there is a cure within reach for every disorder he gets rid of a cold at the house of one child of a  fever  at that of another of a touch of the rhumatism at a third's and at a fourth's of an headach Upon getting a little more into the private history of the house  from a guest who was my next hand neighbour and just animated enough with wine to become a benevolent historian I found that the grand children were worthy of the sire for that all the brothers of which there were nine had entered into a social domestic compact the particular articles of which had been committed to writing that in the course of affairs they were mutually to serve each other either with a sum of money or any other assistance suited to the nature and necessity of the case And as if Providence intended to try the virtue and sincerity of each all the brothers in turn  wanted  and  found  a friend in the good offices of each otherAh my friend we have not got all the simplicity happiness and virtue to ourselves and God forbid we ever should have How blessed to share them as they  are  shared with all the human race  I have gleaned various instances of their being dispersed over these divisions of the globe I have shewn to you the natural affections blooming in Holland Cambria and Westphalia Permit me now to present to you one more example of which I was an eye witness in the first mentioned country  In a trip from the Hague to Rotterdam and from thence to Haarlem I was just in time for the afterdinner boat to get a place in the cabin and to see an aged mother and her daughter give and receive the farewel looks expressions and embraces to and from some friends and relatives Never did I see the feelings of the heart shine with more lucid brightness while each was in view of the other nor descend in more tender tears when they could behold each other no longer As the boat moved on the groupe on shore followed as long as they could at the edges of the canal and the party in the cabin thrust their heads out of the door to catch the kind looks and sayings till the horse being hooked to the schuyt they could no longer keep pace with us The succeeding moments were passed in deep sighs on the part of the mother and tears on that of the daughter neither of whom took any more notice of me nor of any other person in the cabin than of the cushions they sat on A person in the corner told me these people would perhaps never see each other again for some years as the mother and daughter were going to settle in North Holland  I was prepared to hear him say North America at least but to people  untravelled  a  separation of fifty miles is an immeasurable distance And the sympathy of divided affection extends the space to infinity The silence was long and I honoured them for it had there been a cranny in their hearts for the entrance of common place curiosity or for conversation with a stranger I should have deemed it a robbery of what was due to their absent friends I perceived the daughter to strain her longing eyes towards the only opening at which there might be a  possibility  of catching a parting glympse of her relations and I discovered at the same time that I intercepted her sight would to heaven that stranger did not sit betwixt me and my friends was the sentiment written in every line of her face but as she continued to look I gave her all the chances she could expect by moving my position No sooner had I done so than she exclaimedI see poor Catherine's cloak and the skirt of Sally's gown through the window The glow of that friendship which is so deliciously animating in the days of our youth flushed her cheeks but it was sweetly blended also with the gratitude which at that period of our lives gives such a colouring and grace to the complexion after this she farther won my regard by such a pensive cast of the head and direction of the eyes  as plainly indicated her heart was returning to the Hague with her friends and she took little or no notice of any thing or any body else during the rest of the voyage  I have slightly mentioned to you somewhere the love of ornament amongst the Dutch as inconsistent with the weight not to say heaviness of their appearance I think this overfinery is to be discovered principally in their liveries which are often gaudy and rich  sometimes  elegant It is exhibited also in their furniture barges chimneys china and mills It even shews itself in certain indescribable places yet generally speaking all these things are so out of keeping with their own figures and fashionssuch for instance as their deep brown or blue suits of Dutch homespun or Prussian their unyielding features immense breeches preposterous petticoats stupendous hippads and measured pacethat they seem as little of a piece as if the said homespun jerkins c were to be trimmed with gold and silver foils and fringes  As to the  waterfaring men  fresh or salt they are  bebuttoned  from top to toe each button not excepting those of the waistband a third  part larger than an English crownpiece and always of solid silver One whimsical fellow who was master of a fishingsmack used to exhibit himself with a suit of coarse blue bays or serge the coat buttons of which were Zealand sixdollars a piece of silver the size of our crown the waistcoat was buttoned with florins the trowzers with schellings larger than our shilling the waistband and flaps with pieces of thirty stivers halfacrown his check shirt with dublikys silver twopences and his shoes were fastened by twentyeight stiver pieces cut into clasps and a gilder for the button of his hat which hat was in itself a curiosity being folded into three corners in the way that grocers make up their pennyworths into long bags of whitebrown paper which you know are  "Small by degrees and  subimsically  less"  Indeed even the  higher  class of Hollanders are too full of button wearing four where an Englishman would content himself with one and placing them so close that it is quite a labour to fasten and loose them  I have praised the Dutch neatness it is  worthy  of praise but occasionally carried to  excess It now and then goes into caricature You have always the fear of the pail and scrubbing brushes before your eyes On the grand cleaning day which here is Friday the maid servants are to be seen puddling below ankledeep and spouting above at the windows as if they were playing off an engine to extinguish a conflagration although the great end proposed is only to wash away the dust that may have gathered on the sashes in the course of the week An English traveller who comes from the comfort of a dry room or whose state of health would suffer from damps must reconcile to this  désagrement  as well as he can as he will from an intention of civility be shewn into an apartment just washed he had better double his defense by an additional pair of socks or stockings for the Dutch landlord would deem it rude to take his guest into a room that has not been laid under water since the last company went out of it and were you to argue against the thing he would set you down as a dirty traveller who did not know how to behave yourself in a clean country  Through every part of Holland the natives are great observers of symmetry Is a brush  for example part of the furniture of a room it will be found hanging up equidistant with another of the same size shape and fashion to answer it  "Cup faces cup each sancer has its brother  "And half the cupboard just reflects the other"  This matter is also spoken to in former Gleanings  But with respect to the modes of  dressing  it is out of my memory whether I have before mentioned a great and general resemblance betwixt the Welch and German peasantry At least eighty out of every hundred of the latter are habited in the dark blue or deep brown of the former and have a number of customs in common which is the less to be wondered at when we consider the mixture of the two nations when the Saxons sometimes by treachery sometimes by invitation and sometimes by invasion became masters or partners of Cambria But so many ages having passed away since the Saxon heptarchy and even since the expulsion of the Germans whether friends or enemies from the principality of Wales it was curious enough for a traveller who had just been gleaning that country to find such a  general resemblance in the dress air habits and even features of a people so remote and with which modernly speaking they had not nor ever could have the slightest intercourse  They who came over out of Germany into Wales says Caradoc to aid the Britons against their enemies the Picts and Scots were partly Saxons Angles and Juthes from the first of which came the people of Essex Sussex Middlesex and the West Saxons from the Angles the East Angles and the Mercians and they that inhabited the North side of the Humber from the Juthes the Kentish men and they who settled in the Isle of Wight  Thus the English nation and its appendages like the English language appears to be a compound of every other country and particularly of Germany From settlements marriages descents c it is reasonable that there should be preserved some family customs and family features A likeness of countenance may be traeed indeed through all classes of the Empires of Germany and Great Britain and the former being certainly taken as an whole a brave ingenious and generous  nation I was pleased to trace the similitude and admit the original alliance Time has worn out the resentments but whatever brings to memory a bond of connexion and of amity though formed between individuals or countries three thousand years ago has a charm for the heart Had I but the hem of a garment in my possession that had been worn by the greatest foe of my family on the day of reconciliation or at the moment that he came to my ancestor whom he had injured to avow and to repent of the wrong and to promise future lovingkindnessthat fragment of the dress should have a place in my wardrobe and be held as a memorial  With regard to the ancient Germans were we to take a comparative view of them and of the ancient Britons we should find a similitude in the features of their minds as well as manners especially in the grand articles of war and religion The heroes sages and priests of one country had their counterparts in the other had Cambria her Druids Bards and Chiefs that devoted themselves to wounds and death for the sake of God and their country conformably to the sacrifice the chivalry and worship of the times the Germanic  nations had holy brave and wise men who corresponded to these characters and afford additional evidence of their having borrowed manners maxims and superstitions from one another  In order to throw lustre on the parallel I will pick a little historical Gleaning of what I remember We venerate the traditionary independence which animated the ancient Welch The ancient Germans cultured the same spirit The Roman historian reports them to respect only those duties which they imposed on themselves The noblest youths blushed not to be numbered among the faithful companions of some renowned chiefs to whom they devoted their arms and service A noble emulation prevailed amongst the companions to obtain the first place in the esteem of their chief amongst the chiefs to acquire the greatest number of valiant companions The glory of such distinguished heroes diffused itself beyond the narrow limits of their own tribe In the hour of danger it was shameful for the chief to be surpassed in valour by his companions shameful for the companions not to equal the valour of their chief To survive his fall in battle was indelible infamy To protect his  person and to adorn his glory with the trophies of their own exploits were the most sacred of their duties The chiefs combated for the victory the companions for the chief The noblest warriours whenever their native country was sunk in the laziness of peace maintained their numerous bands in some distant scene of action to exercise their restless spirit and to acquire renown by voluntary dangers Gifts worthy of soldiers the warlike steed the bloody and ever victorious lance were the rewards which the companions claimed from the liberality of their chief The rude plenty of his hospitable board was the only pay that  he  could bestow or  they  would accept War and the freewill offerings of his friends supplied this munificence  But to use the language of Bishop Hurd on another occasion and apply them to this lest you should think my love of antiquity has operated like enchantment in regard to the ancient German chiefs and companions I must desire you to consider the courage and conduct of the modern ones who have so long and so nobly and almost without a day's recess repelled the hordes of France when almost  her whole population has been forced into the field  Can we discover in times past a braver a more faithful or a more persevering body of men than those subjects of Austria who are at this very moment under command of Beaulieu Clairfait and Cobourg Each of whom might certainly hold a place in the temple of Victory as distinguished as any general that Rome had to boast Nor could the boldest of the race of Cadwallader be dishonoured by an alliance with the sublime progenitors of these illustrious descendents  It is painful to observe that the religious zeal of the old Germans was as wild savage and  fatal  as that of the ancient Britons and that the fanatic ministers of the one answered to the Druids of the other Both were alike able to persuade that "by some ridiculous arts of divination they could discover the will of the superior beings and both taught that human sacrifices were the most precious and acceptable offerings to their altars The Germanic like the Druidical temples were in dark and ancient groves consecrated by the reverence of succeeding generations  Their secret gloom the imagined residence of an invisible power says Gibbon by presenting no distinct object of fear or worship impressed  the mind with a still deeper sense of religious horror  I am sorry to discover a yet stricter similitude between the Priests of Germany and the Druids of Wales the former no less than the latter we are informed had been taught by experience the use of every artifice that could preserve and fortify impressions so well suited to their own interest and it has been finely remarked that the same ignorance which renders barbarians incapable of conceiving and of embracing the useful restraints of law exposes then aked and unarm'd to the blind terrors of superstition The German priests improving this favourable temper of their countrymen even in temporal concerns which the magistrate could not venture to exercise and the defects of civil policy were sometimes supplied by the interposition of ecclesiastical authority  We find too that ancient Germany like ancient Briton had her bards whose genius character and office were extremely alike in one country and in the other It is not easily to be conceived says one of Rome's best historians how this singular order of men speaking of the German bards contrived to kindle the enthusiasm of arms and glory in the breasts  of their audience It was in the hour of battle or in the feast of victory that they celebrated the glory of heroes of ancient days the ancestors of those warlike chieftains who listened with transport to the animated strains The view of arms of victory and of danger heightened the effect of the military song and the passions which it tended to excite the desire of fame and the contempt of death were the habitual sentiments of a German mind  We may easily suppose that with the help of a glowing imagination which was not wanting the audience imputed to the bards of Germany all the power which poesy herself has in some of her noblest flights attributed to the bards of Wales  "Cadwallo's tongue  That hush'd the stormy main  Modred whose magic song  Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud capt head"  Nor have the Princes of Germany degenerated from their ancestry none of whom have higher claims on the love of the people or the eulogy of the modern bards than the amiable and youthful monarch who now fills the imperial throne Of his warlike atchievements during the present campaign the trump of fame has  sufficiently informed you but there is a trait of his  heart  in private and domestic life which I receive from the most unquestionable authority and which will endear him to you more than a thousand victories  Joseph the second who was an oeconomist left to Leopold who did not live long enough after he became Emperor to dissipate them an unincumber'd diadem and immense treasures These all concenter'd in the present Emperor to whom was bequeathed the disposal of them so unconditionally that the dowager empress his mother was in a manner rather a dependent on his bounty than possess'd of powers in herself to claim as widow wife and mother No sooner did the youth find himself thus dangerously placed than he resolved to put it out of his  own  power to act unbecoming the son of an Empress and Queen Convening therefore his court and council he appropriated an early day for his coronation or rather nomination to the emperorshipthe regular ceremony being performed long after at Frankfortand he intreated the honour that the Queen Dowager would assist at it The assembly was brilliant the young monarch rose in the midst of it and holding in his hand a scroll thus addressed  himself to his ministers in the presence of thousands of his subjects"I perceive a passage of great importance is omitted in the will of my royal father No suitable independent provision has been made for my beloved and imperial mother The long tried virtues of that noble lady the tender confidence and domestic love in which she lived with my father convinces me that it never could have been intended that so good a wife so kind a parent and so excellent a woman could be left in a state of dependence on her son Much more likely is it that the son should have been bequeathed to the commands indulgence and management of his mother Or if it  was  intended that the son should  receive  the whole revenues of the empire it could only be in confidence that he would act as her agent and see that her private her natural and proper rights were paid into her coffers with the least care and inconvenience to herself  "In the latter case I hope I should be found throughout my reign a faithful steward of my dear parent and of the people and supposing for a moment this case a possible one I cannot be insensible to the exalted affection and esteem the late Emperor and King must have for me  that he could after his death confide the fortunes of such a wife to the trust of his son But human nature is so frail and the trust is so aweful that I tremble while I possess it and cannot indeed be easy till I have disburthened myself of the weight it imposes To this end my loving friends ministers and subjects I have herein bound myself shewing the scroll by an instrument of the last solemnity to become responsible in a yearly sum suited to her rank although inferior to her deservings And I have as nearly as may be made this disposition from my private funds and from sources the least likely to infringe on or to affect the treasures of the state which I hold in trust  also  for the honour of my empire and the prosperity of Austria yet I consider myself as called upon by my subjects to explain account for and justify every expenditure before I make an arrangement in favor of any part of my own family But I feel at the same time that it is an act of duty and justice on my part which will be crowned by the sanction of all any people  "Here then madam continued the royal youth dropping on his knee as he descended from his throne and presenting the scrollhere  is the deed by which I relieve myself from an insupportable burthenthe idea of your majesty's becoming the victim of a son's weakness indiscretion or ingratitude and you will find that I have by the same act taken the liberty to appoint you the guardian of my youth in all that can properly be called if any thing can my  private fortunes  I retain in my hand the  public treasures  because the weight of them would from the multiplicity of demands be attended with fatigue to you but I shall not fail from time to time as exigences may arise to derive benefit in their application from your known wisdom goodness of heart and judgement and your love of the empire"  With regard to the public one might very reasonably expect from such an outset what has happened in the progress of the reign of this monarchwe were prepared for his having almost emptied the coffers of his private property and almost stript his palace of his furniture many of its necessaries and all its luxuries before he invited the assistance of his people to carry on this unparalleled war for their sake for his own and for that of human kind It is a literal fact that he sent all his gold and silver services of plate to the mint  now he contents himself with common porcelain Should the  invasion of the rights of men  continue he will probably be reduced to earthen ware and to shew that his spirit in the field is equal to his generous sacrifices at home he left a beloved wife in the most affecting crisis of a woman's life to be the first in danger as in honour He is now only in the twentyfourth year of his agesurely nothing but a Carmagnol could wish to shorten the life of such a monarch or of such a man but the  name  of King includes tyranny it seems and every head "that wears a crown" according to the new system deserves to lose it The rule does not admit of an exception Notwithstanding which I shall hazard the  treason  to wish that the present Emperor of Germany the present King of GreatBritain and of every other Prince  like unto them  may survive not only the malicious plots of their enemies whether secret or avowed but the  enemies themselves  and I trust I should have firmness and loyalty enough to breathe this wish this prayer though it should bring me to the edge of that instrument which for a similar offence has immolated such hecatombs of victims  Yet there are amongst the subjects even of this beloved Sovereign many thousands of persons who would aid and abet these extirpations of royalty in planting a dagger in his heartThe Brabançons the people of Liege and many large bodies of the  higher  as well as  lower  parts of the empire conceal their treason in applause and their discontent in flattery but lie in wait for an occasion like the folded serpent in the grass to sting the bosom that nourishes and arrest the arm which defends them This is so true that in Germany as in other parts of the world the foe  within our gates  and even our familiar friends who can smile upon their master and be villains are more to be dreaded than the external enemy Against the open violence of the latter we can guard and force may be opposed to force but from the insidious machinations of the first the hour of confidence may be that of treachery and the moment of apparent endearment may mingle poisons wounds and death with embraces  Amidst so much unnatural conduct in different parts of the world it is as  refreshing  as rare to meet with an instance of loyalty in  any  part of it Such was the splendid and spirited  offer of the little town or rather village of Broek in North Holland whose beauties and singularities I gave in a former Gleaning The inhabitants of this place sent word to the Stadtholder and the States General that if either the armies or the treasuries of the provinces wanted assistance the patriot gift of twenty or thirty tons of silver and five or ten of gold should not be wantingbut alason the per contra side of this solitary fact what a long list of murmurs rebellions massacres and of treasons might not be set down even in the span of earth and water that appertains to the Dutchto go no farther And though the last revolution threw  them  fifty years behind hand in

sensations but no sooner as you know had I refreshed my spirit at the sight of so much peace and plenty gratified my heart by the transient view of some who were dear to me at home and heard of some important successes abroad I followed once more the bent of my "truant disposition"  and revisited the scenes from which I had been driven It was as you recollect in the midst of a month that would soon have ripened all the fruits of the earth and made "the heart of the husbandman sing for joy" had not his hopes been destroyed torn up by the roots and trampled under the foot of the merciless enemy I repassed all my ancient paths and to a certain distance found some traces of the lovely scenery I had left and which I have already Gleaned for you I advanced a little and soon came to the  extreme edge of peace  Words were they written by Shakspeare's pen could not duly describe the change which had taken place in the space of an hundred yards farther measuring from the spot from  whence  peace plenty and nature seemed to have taken flight as if like other terrified emigrants they had sought protection in our Queen of Isles  A small arm of the Rhine separated me from a

they  took possession of other people's property  I have gleaned for you a correct copy of one of their edicts issued on the day after their entering Prussian Guelderland even when they came as friends on a visit of  confraternity  Au nom de la Republique Françoise  Il est  ordonné  aux administrateurs tresoriers et receveurs quelconques des droits et impositions dans le Gueldre Prussienne c de ne verser leurs recettes qu'entre les mains des personnes commises par leur differentes communautés à l'esset de faire le levée des contributions imposées au nom de la Republique Françoise jusqu' à

vis à vis de la Republique Françoise sous peine d'encourir fa disgrace et d'étre traité comme ses ennemis  Le General commandant l'avant garde de l'armée du Nord  Signe LE MARLIERE  Au Quartier General à Ruremonde le  m  e Decémbre l'année première de la Republique  TRANSLATION  In the name of the French Republic  This is to give notice that all administrators treasurers stewards agents c whatsoever in Prussian Guelderland shall not give any receipts or pay any money except into the hands of the commissions appointed and authorised on the part of the French Republic until the whole contribution be paid as ordered by General La Maliere  And it is by virtue of the said authority strictly forbidden to let any manner of provisions beasts or forage go out of the said provinces until the said engagements with the Republic of France are fulfilled upon pain of incurring its disgrace and of being treated as its enemy  So much for French brotherhood  In the very little village of Swoegen consisting of half a dozen poor farms and a few cottages was a levy besides their quota of the provisions of florins  In that of Mierlo not much larger florins  In other parts of Prussian Guelderland florins  Forage florins  Besides eating drinking during the possession of the country  N B Most of the beautiful trees walks shrubberies c destroyed by way of frolic as these honest patriots amused themselves during the  leisure of victory  heifer  nor the bleat of a lamb was to be heard A few sad birds in melancholy notes chanted a funeral dirge over their ruined bowers and thickets most of which had been "hewn down and cast into the fire" In one of these groves being at a walking distance from the neighbouring  town where I made one of my gleaning pauses I had in a former visit been at some pains to form a seat of fresh sods to discipline the foliage on either side and canopy the branches above chiefly because it was in the neighbourhood of two or three nightingales who sang their sorrows to each other and because a stockdove had built in the back ground And it had the farther  agrément  of a brook that after an hundred fantastic mazes amongst the meadows and fields adjacent took its course along the underwood through which I could see it stream as I sat and I could besides hear it dispute and struggle with the impediments it found in its way Of these it complained so gently as very well to associate with the notes of my dove and nightingales Although I had thrown the arching of my alcove as far forward cave like as I could with a design to exclude too obtrusive a visit of the sun and of the world I could observe at the openings of the oak branches part of a fine field of springing corn and catch a glimpse of some steeples on the one hand and several farmhouses and cottages on the other So that the  toutensemble  you will conceive afforded to a man of poesy and peace all that his heart could desire In this retreat I had passed many a sunsetting and  not seldom a sunrising hour I returned to lament the change All that side of the grove which screened and furnished branches for my alcove was cut away by a sanguine banditti who came  sword in band  into these environs The hand of wantonness had hacked off with the fabre whole nurseries of firs and poplars Most of the houses had been burnt down and the wretched inhabitants plundered of all their little stores Some were dead of wounds some of grief the rest wandered about the world in search of the very few who with the disposition had the power of benevolence  The fields which I left so full of vernal promise were despoiled not an handful of grain remained for a  Gleaner  who was now literally lest to pick his scanty subsistence amidst thorns and briars and though the steeples of some churches were yet to be seen they could be viewed only as the monuments of that dreadful sacrilege which had been committed within I entered one of these and found it had in real and dreadful truth been turned into a den of thieves The altars were broken down and the fragments stained with the blood of its ministers the ruthless soldiery had converted the most holy places into the most obscene indecent  allusions and impious mottos were pencilled on the windows doors and even on the sainted reliques and the images of the Redeemer were demolished with every mark of mockery and scorn  In that sheaf of our Gleaning gathered in and sent you from Wales I forgot to mention and indeed it will come in better at this place that when I was at Bangor the Warder of the cathedral of that episcopal city told me that one of its ancient bishops was struck blind by a thunderbolt from heaven for the sacrilegious act of felling the bells The consternation of the Warder on recounting this as we stood discoursing under the bellfry could scarce have been exceeded had the thunderbolt fallen on his own head What would this honest son of simplicity have concluded had I been then able to inform him that the French were cutting off the heads and mangling the limbs of  their  bishops not for selling the revenues of the church but for daring to assist at and administer divine worship for attachment to their king for believing in a Saviour of the world and for not turning apostate to their God nay furthermore that they condemned the holy men most eminent for talents and piety to the stake the cannot the musquet or the guillotine and lastly that so far from sparing the bells on account of their fanctity that they convert them into instruments of murderthe murder of the best priests the best citizens and the best men And by way of closing the climax of sacrilege were I to observe that a number of these citizens finding themselves sicken from the vapours of the charcoal and the putrid stench of the dead bodies which they were turning  ut of the coffins that the lead thereof might be made into bullets and ballswould not the poor man with a better reason than superstition has to offer conclude that the porsonous nausea thus seizing them was a signal mark of divine judgement Before the aera of liberty Frenchmen would have considered it in that light likewise  Several tombs were torn  open and the "canonised bones" which had been deposited for centuries were hung round the pulpit and the ruins of the altarpiece  The habitations were in the same dismantled state all the valuables that were portable had been carried off in waggons tumbled into the heap of promiscuous plunder and nothing remained but the  wreck  of the fixtures and the miserable proprietors who had escaped the pillagers mourning or famishing over them One sweetlyrustic abode that I had the preceding year  distinguished  as the dearest residence of a numerous humble yet not indigent family the proofs of whose industry and content I had seen shine in every plate glass table chair and cupboard and where I had been accustomed to see a groupe of healthy and happy faces was become a general ruin The father was marked down by some of his base townsmen as an avowed lover of his country and had on a late exigence join'd some of his neighbours to make head against a party of  foragers who would have driven off the herds and flocks This was so soul a crime in the eyes of the French that they cut off the head of the tree and mangled several of the branches The very boards and bricks of the rooms were torn up I ran over the house with horror I passed through three of the apartments without meeting one consolatory object I began to fear every vestige of humanity had been destroyed by these its  sworn exterminators  when coming to the broken staircase I heard a voice which had  often welcomed  me I ascended and saw the wretched remnants of this oncejoyful family crouded into the only chamber that remained habitabletwo halfgrown boys an old woman and the young daughter who had spoken to me On comparing their present with their past state the latter opened on my mind  new ideas of human vicissitude  I instantly called to my remembrance that the last time I had seen these very persons the two first objects were sporting on the green before their door in all the glee of body and of soul The old woman and her husband were sitting on a bench environed with honeysuckles that twisted selfbent into a natural canopy and the daughter was "leaning halfraised" on the flowery ground at the feet of her parents  and laughing at the anticks of her two brothers  Why should I paint to you the dire reverse Alas the reverse goes almost out of the reach even of  imagination  It is not easy to suppose the ravagers  could  in so short a space of time change  every happy circumstance to its bitterest opposite  that they could turn for instance plenty into famine health to disease and a contented mind to an agonized broken spirit Yet all this had been done  by the sons of liberty  who too truly put their threat in execution of  carrying misery and death  into every place they visited  As to my poor nightingales and stockdove though they had more cause than ever to lament that terror which in conventional language is  the order of the day  had sent them to mourn prematurely in other lands  " The very spot  "Where many a time they carol'd was forgot"  for the little thicket which had been their leafy sanctuary was burnt up by these glorious  free  bootersbecause forsooth the proprietor was wicked enough to attempt saving himself  and family by flight when he heard that a party of  patriots  were likely to invade his village and the guilty wretch was another  traitor  who had unfortunately distinguished himself on a former occasion as a lover of his country Nothing in short remained of the various innocent and interesting objects my heart had appreciated but a fragment of the brook part of which had been destroyed in the fury of extirpating the thicket and from the broken gaps the water had worked its way into an opposite current to the left where in forming a junction of sounds it seemed to lament the general ruin But God knows the surrounding calamities required no aids from fancy On the contrary in this poor suffering little town and its environs there  actually  happened such horrors as Fancy when  most  disposed to excite terror her strongest attribute never formed Dreadful  beyond  imagination was a fact which these inhuman republicans perpetrated on the sucking infant of the hapless fugitive last mentioned He had information that the enemy would be at Kreutznach in a few hours and being told that he would certainly be amongst the  proscribed  on account of the active part he had taken when a party of peasants bravely defended their all against a former horde he  followed the impulse of a panicstruck moment and filled his two carts the one with his family the other with his moveable effects in order to send them away to a brother farmer's where they could find a promised protection He followed his little household with an aching yet comforted heart but hearing the sound of the enemy's guns in the road they were to take and supposing the route had been changed he returned to his cottage and had hope that the plunderers would pursue another plan Alas this was a flattering expectation The patriots had heard that a detachment of Prussians were still in Kreutznach but learning soon after from a scout that they had marched out of the village the preceding evening the patriots silently made their way into the heart of the town before it was suspected they were in the neighbourhood for it was late in the night or rather early in the morning and the peaceful harmless inhabitants were in their beds You will better judge of the confusion than I can describe it The peasant sacrificed the dead to save the living and taking his wife in one hand and his children linked arm in arm in the other the suckling lying on its mother's breast he left his dwelling with a hope of still gaining the  asylum A patriot  countryman  and neighbour however with whom he had often disputed on the subject of his principles noticed his departure and conducted the sanguine enemy int the path he had taken They lingered about till the dawn which alas broke too soon for the fugitives who on hearing the voice of their menacing pursuers had plunged into a wood to the left but the crying of their own child betrayed them The barbarians rushed into the wood where spreading themselves they overtook the female part of the wanderers whom the poor peasant had quitted for the moment to explore a track that he conceived might lead them to a small hamlet on the left and which consisting only of a few scattered huts that stood on the skirts of the forest might still preserve his family Meantime they were seated as he thought in so secure a recess that the "dogs of war" though in full cry could not harm them during his absence He was mistaken The bloodhounds discovered their haunt and seizing the trembling mother they tore the babe from her breast and striking off its head threw the bloody gift into her lap as a  present to her husband  dreadfully swearing at the same time that if she did not persuade him to return and solicit  pardon for his past offenses against the  French Republic  that her own head and that of every other child should answer it They left her for other mischief Cruel as it is my friend you are impatient for the sequel of this bloody adventure which I received nearly as I relate it from the mouth of the desolate wife  On the return of her husband guess if you can his sensationsthe bleeding head of his youngest infant the lifeless trunk of its little body the agonized mother the no less shocking prospect of the remainder of them all before him Let your beating heart have rest however as to the remainder of this poor family After the Carmagnols had past some hours in the ravage of Kreutznach and in raising such exactions as left famine to finish what the sword had begun the approach of the Prussians compelled the enemy to evacuate the town and the peasants returnedthey returned indeed to an heap of ruins where  "Once the garden smil'd"  and where I had so lately  seen  with delighted eyes all that the sweetest poetry has ever fancied or described  "Those calm desires that ask but little room  "Those healthful sports that grac'd the peaceful scene  "Liv'd in each look and brighten'd all the green"  I generally walk with a small edition of the author of these verses an author who was one of the earliest friends of my youth and whom my youthful muse sincerely lamented in my pocket  His  exquisite poems and the Seasons of Thomson are amongst the dearest of my travelling equipage On my word of honour I feel a gratitude a respect an affection nay a  passion of the heart  for every leas for with how many charming ideas have they filled it when my own thoughts were comfortless and sad and during the summer months though I know almost every passage by rote I have one or the other of these  Glories of our ingenious isle  in my hand and  "In all my wand'rings round this world of care"  they appear to be partakers of my pilgrimage I thus seem to be in the company of two of my most illustrious countrymen and when I peruse their pages I seem but to repeat their conversation  But never did I think I should be a dweller upon earth when almost every beauty and  innocence of nature that each has so sweetly sung should be cut down for so many leagues together and left by the cruel spoilers to clot and wither in human gore Still less did I suppose I should so often have occasion to  apply  or to  contrast  so many of their passages Had the author of the "Deserted Village" lived in these times and gleaned like me the places which the enemy of mankind have overrun all the distress of that poem which bewailed in some measure an imaginary or at least a partial evil would quit its objects to lament others a thousand fold more to be deplored To see  "The rural virtues leave the land"  as an effect of that luxury which  "Indignant spurns the cottage from the green"  And while  "Trade's unfeeling train  "Usurp the land and dispossess the swain"  And still further to observe  "Contented teil and hospitable care  "And kind connubial tenderness  "And piety with wishes plac'd above  "And steady loyalty and faithful love  "Pass from the shore and darken all the strand"  is a melancholy sight and worthy to be  mourned by the muse of Goldsmith But while the poor exiles took with them many of their dearest consolations  "The good old sire that first prepar'd to go  "The lovely daughter lovelier in her tears"  And while the fond mother could  "Kiss her thoughtless babes with many a tear  "And clasp them close in sorrow doubly dear"  their passage to  "New found worlds beyond the western main"  and all their destiny is bliss compared with the execrable deeds which have been heaped on the head of the inhabitants of the countries that border on or rather comprehend the theatre of the present war  And in fine when I left one desolated place in the hope of gaining more repose and seeing less sorrow in another it was generally speaking but going from bad to worse An irregular and still disappointed tour which included most of the towns and villages in the neighbourhood of the Saar the Sambre the Mozelle the Zorn the Meuse and the Lower Rhine in those branches which stretch along the frontiers in different directions comprehending  one way an excursion from Coblentz to the Duchy of Deux Pontsfrom Louvain to Givet another from Binche to Bouchain a third and so on till I returned like an hunted hare to the place from whence I set out presented me with nothing but  "A bitter change severer for severe  Young  "  I have followed the  victorious  in their burning pursuit of the flying enemy even when my way has been sometimes impeded by the bleeding bodies and mangled limbs of the  vanquished  Unable from wounded feelings to proceed I have returned to the spots where the action began and there seen the horror desolation and famine by which even  conquest  has been gained Even on the day when such conquest has filled the dismantled and half depopulated streets of the rescued town with the shout of victorswhen solemn  Te Deums  have been appointed to be sung in all places of public worship I have beheld that mass of private misery which is frequently no less the companion of victory than the attendant of defeat the shrick of the widow the orphan and the childless parent were still nearly the same  Had my poor friend Goldsmith survived to witness them how much more reason would he have had to exclaim while on  one day  he heard or saw in  several  villages not inferior to his Auburn  "The swain responsive as the milk maid sung  "The sober herd that low'd to meet their young  "The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool  "The playful children just let loose from school  "The watchdog's voice that bay'd the whispering wind  "And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind"  What additions I say my dear friend would have been given to his reasons of complaint were he to have been an auditor and spectator of these objects on one day and on perhaps the very next to find the swain ruined or murdered the milkmaid violated the head driven into the enemy's camp the children deprived of a father and the whole country destroyed Had the subject of his pen been only the sanguinary annals of a  few hours  depredation in the village of Dudelange  Or of Chimay a sweet little village upon the beauteous river Blanch between the picturesque forests of Thierach and Fagne in the fine county of Hainault But for many ages the demon of war has ravaged the charms of ChimayWholly however to extirpate them to turn the town and the environs into the tomb of their harmless inhabitants of the proprieters and their property was reserved for the French Republicans  a small place in the disastrous  province of Luxembourg where decrepid old men sick persons women labouring with child babes at the breast or in the cradle became the indiscriminate victims of these monsters had he seen the lives of those miserable beings taken away by absolutely  innova  ns  cruelty  and attested the wanton iniquity of tearing up the young and tender crops which their industry had sown he would  indeed  have had reason to exclaim  "Sweet smiling village loveliest of the lawn  "Thy sports are fled and all thy charms withdrawn  "Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen  "And desolation saddens all thy green  "And trembling shrinking from the spoiler's hand  "Far far away thy children leave the land  But it is far beyond the reach even of  Enthusiast as I am to the energy of his muse and dearly as I love the memory of the man with whom I have past so many happy hours when life and poetry were young to me and consequently when both were more full of charms I must acknowledge that even when I have in the course of this last journe amongst the ruins of humanity applied the choicest language from the muse of my deceased friend to deplore that I sa  s  many proofs of a tyrant's power I have felt that language too feeble for the occasion  And when in surveying the wreek of some spot that once realised the flights of his happiest fancy I have exclaimed  "Here as I take my solitary rounds  "Amidst the tangling walks and ruin'd grounds  "And  not a year elassed  return to view  "Where once the cottage stood the hawthorn grew  "Here as with doubtful pensive steps I range  "Trace every scene and wonder at the change  "Remembrance wakes with all her busy train  "Swells at my breast and turns the past to pain"  Even this have I found a faint though beautiful picture of the factsI do not recommend any man to make the same experiment but if the sober headed or cold hearted reasoner who has read the effusions of a warm imagination and given to human calamities a stronger pathos and a deeper colour than the critic in his elbow chair supposes  can  belong thereto a journey to these scenes of private grief and public misery would soon convince him that we live in a world in some parts of which there are daily perhaps hourly happening distresses far too poignant for the pen or the pencil though Rubens were to hold the one and Shakspeare the other and indeed that much of what has been condemned as romance is but an underwritten or underpainted history of circumstances in real life But after all it is wrong in me to set down such condemnation to a cold heart or headThese will never be amongst the defects imputed to the Gleaner and yet had he not been an eyewitness to the different calamities described in these volumes he must have attributed some of these calamities had they been represented by any other person to the work of fiction  Goldsmith's poetry to offer an adequate description of  atrocities of plunder sword and fire which throw into shadow the utmost barbarity of the Goths and Vandals  And the evil is still growing still extending its horrors Though I have at length turned from them the memory of the past is never to be erased the present is full of apprehension and the miseries of the future cannot be calculated Remote as is now this peaceful place from the immediate scenes of action it shields me not from a thousand dreadful sights of the wounded and the desolate Two waggons loaded with the former this morning pass'd my window and an equal number are expected tomorrow If you ask me why I threw myself so much in the way of scenes like these so foreign so repugnant to every feeling of my soul why I remained in their view so long I can only answer that in the first instance I went to revisit places and people which had once given me pleasure and I desired to share their pain in a reverse of fortune secondly when once involved it was not easy to disentangle my steps and lastly I lost myself in the bloody mazes  LETTER LXX TO THE SAME  Valenciennes  HOW often in surveying these horrible wrecks of human affairs have I reiterated that apostrophe which you did me the honour so much to approve on the first publication of a work whose chief design was to paint the miseries of war in general and of civil war in particular You will accept one passage which came to my mind many times in the course of these military Gleanings amongst surrounding scenes of death of ruin and of havock  "  Emma Corbett  Ah earth thou common parentthou whose nourishing bosom furnishes to all the children of content that will cultivate thy kindness how art thou made the object of sanguinary ambition Into what ridiculous portions of ideal property art thou cut out quarrelled and contended for How often does the bounteous sun that shines upon thy surface to expand the grain and to cherish thy various productions leave thy verdant mantle dipt in gore  "O peace thou image of divinity itself descend upon that earth from whence the mistakes of altercating relations have so long affrighted thee Subdue gentle power the fierce soul of rebellion I call upon thee in the names of nature reason humanity and justiceI call upon thee in the name of nature's God"  But lest my loved friend you should deem this in some measure the rhapsody of a poetical mind strongly moved by the sad scenery that environs it at this moment when I am in the midst of the horrors that have been produced by conflagration famine sorrow desolation despair and all the evils of war suffer me to call in the support of one who though he was writing in a well secured city in times of profound peace and public prosperity at least when the rumours of war could reach him but by a medium long after the mischief apprehended and who tho' he reasoned as a politician and philosopher felt as a man "War" says he "is the last of all remedies  cuncta prius t  n  da  all lawful expedients must be used to avoid it 'Tis wonderful with what coolness and indifference the greater part of mankind see war commenced Those that hear of it at a distance or read of it in books but have never presented  its evils to their minds much more those let me add that write as I do now on the polluted spots where those evils have just happened consider it as little more than a splendid game a proclamation an army a battle and a triumph Some indeed they allow must perish perhaps some of their dearest friends in the most successful field but then they died upon the bed of honour resign their lives amidst the joys of conquest and filled with glory smile in death  "But war has means of destruction more formidable than the cannon and the sword Of the thousands and tens of thousands that have perished in the late contests a very small part ever felt the stroke of the enemy the rest languished in tents and towns or places of refuge amidst damps and putrefaction pale torpid spiritless and helpless gasping and groaning unpitied amongst men made obdurate by the continuance of hopeless misery and many of which must at last die without notice and without remembrance Of that number are multitudes now lingering or agonizing in the hospitals which I have visited with a very akeing heart If he that shared the danger enjoyed the profit and after bleeding in the battle grew rich by  the victory he might shew even his gains without envy but at the conclusion of a ten years war how are we recompensed for the death of multitudes and the expence of millions but by contemplating the sudden glories of paymasters and agents contractors and commissaries whose equipages shine like meteors and whose palaces rise like exhalations"  All this is unquestionably true of war in general and no less certainly founded in fact is the exception which has been made that as there are diseases in animal nature which nothing but amputation can remove so there is by the depravation of human passions sometimes a gangrene in human societies for which fire and sword are the necessary remedies That the force collected against France is of this fort I think there are few even of those who wished a reform and silently approved the primary measures taken towards it but must acknowledge at the same time that they must applaud the caution that withheld the British empire from joining in the dreadful operations while there was yet room for gentler methods Never perhaps in the annals of history was there a crisis at which Bolingbroke's remark could be so apposite as that at which we have  now arrived "If ever says he a test for the trial of spirits can be necessary it is  now  if ever those of real liberty and clamorous faction ought to be distinguished from each other it is  now  if ever it is incumbent on nations to know what truth is and to follow it it is  now  If we do not take advantage of the standing water of faction the tide will soon turn one way or the other and carry  all before it  " "A people says his lordship who will maintain their liberties far from jogging on silently and tamely like the ass between two burthens must preserve some of the fierceness of the lion and even make their roar to be heard like his whenever they are injured or so much as threatened" but to shew that he does not in this observation mean to recommend that disloyal seditious spirit which creates a perpetual scene of tumult and disorder and exposes the state to dangerous and often fatal convulsions he confesses that a spirit of faction may destroy a free constitution though founded on  "The noblest basis  "Our rights our natural inheritance"  But that a spirit of real liberty never can and lest we should imagine that such a spirit is inconsistent with the loyalty we owe our  sovereign or chief ruler by what ever name his supremacy is distinguished he remarks "that in every kind of government some powers  must  be lodged in particular men for the good order and preservation of the whole community Nothing can be more clear than that the lines which circumscribe the powers are the bounds of separation between the prerogatives of the Prince or other magistrate and the privileges of the people We hence infer that every step which the prince or magistrate makes beyond these bounds is an encroachment on liberty and every attempt towards making such a step is a danger on liberty but if it is righteous to draw the sword against tyrants who endanger this liberty it is not less so to unsheath it against traitors who cover the crimes of rebellion and regicide under the mask of patriotism"  Notwithstanding which we must deeply regret the dire necessity of man thus preying upon man and shudder to reflect there are really those amongst us meriting the censure which an excellent writer has past on themWretches who without virtue labour or hazard while incommodious encampments and unwholsome stations where courage is useless and enterprize  is impracticable are silently dispeopling fleets and sluggishly melting away armies are growing rich as their country is impoverished who rejoice when obstinacy or ambition adds another year to slaughter and devastation who laugh from their desks at bravery and science while they are adding figure to figure and cypher to cypher hoping for a new contract for a new armament and computing the profits of a siege or a tempest  The fighting fanatics are not much more praise worthy either as to their precepts or practice nor the blind mob who follow their doctrine and who talk of liberty because it is a better name for idleness I never hear this clamour for freedom without calling to mind those lines of Milton which so justly characterise the present innovators and their adherents See how they apply  "A barbarous noise environs me  "Of owls and cuckoos asses apes and dogs  "They bawl for freedom in their senseless mond  "And still revolt when truth would set them free  "Licence they mean when they cry liberty  "For who loves that must first be wife and good  "But from that mark how far they are we see  "For all this waste of wealth and loss of blood"  LETTER LXXI TO THE SAME  LIBERTY says my

forefathers to convert the materials with which filial piety had guarded them into the instruments of a bloody war  upon each other  To these must succeed the shuddering annals of prisons forced and

of dissolution from pestilence and famine from battle and murder and from sudden death  Mad wickedness my friend has swept all away Was there ever seen ever recorded such inquisitorial examinations so many oppressive shackles so many violations of the most sacred places so many massacres of citizensNoFrance is itself alone  LETTER LXXII TO THE SAME  THOUGH the enormities committed by these wouldbeRepublicans upon the species in general absorb any acts of cruelty exercised on individuals it is I feel impossible to pass over the fate of Madame de Lamballe one of their most illustrious victims without a particular mark of my attentionthe rather as she was even before the miserable revolution one of those sacrifices which the ribbald pamphleteers of France mangled without any just cause  Besides a personal acquaintance with her myself from which I am able to assure you of her claim to your respect on the basis of many very generous actions I am also in friendship with many who were in the habits of intimacy with her both before and since her unfortunate visit to the court of France and although I cannot say with the Thane of Cawdor that  "She has bought  "  Golden  opinions from all sorts of people"  I can very truly assert that by many of the wise and good in her own country and in England during her residence there her graceful manners her general charity in France and in many other virtues which are held in reverence by the common consent of mankind will make her death bewailed and her memory respected Of the private failings which some have been so sedulous to impute to her since her alliance with her royal and unhappy friend I cannot pretend to speak but it may at least be as fair to set all this down to the score of envy malice or uncharitableness as to that of truth She has often been denied the virtues of which she was known to be in possession by all those who knew herself and it is reasonable to suspect such vices may have been attributed by those who knew her not the dark shadows of which never passed her fancy or her mind To be the favourite lady of a Court and of a Queen of whose favor so many courtiers were jealous to be preeminent for beauty grace and talents are in themselves frequent objects of malice and illreport and not less productive of hatred and envy than of love and admiration nor less dangerous to the possessor than to be the favourite minister of a kinga title to whose kindness though made  out by high and meritorious qualities with respect to the sovereign who distinguishes and rewards them must always become the subject of secret malignancy or open detraction with respect to that part of the public whose vanity suggests to them at least an equal share of the same qualities and who therefore make pretensions to at least equal recompense and being disappointed become slanderers of course and slanderers not only of the said favourites but of the said kings and queens for it is a rule in defamation not only to abuse those whose merit is better rewarded than the defamer's but to involve the persons rewarding it in the like censure And I have often wondered that you my friend who have so many attractions and so many friends ready to acknowledge it should have had so few enemies covert or avowed to dispute your claims I must confess I am amongst the number of those who regard persons whom "  every body is said to speak well of  " as suspicious characters and I have on nearer approaches generally found them overrated especially for the virtues most lavishly  bepraised  And by the same principle I always believe and have as frequently found those people who have a contrary report from this very officious Mr  Everybody who paints his angels and monsters larger than the life have few vices but what have been given to them and that the particular vice most insisted on is the very one from which the party accused is most exempt Perhaps the truth of a character is between that partial one given by a friend that inveterate one imputed by a foe and that insipid neutral one furnished by an indifferent person that has no interest to abuse nor any passion or affection to praise you It floats on my memory that I am repeating an observation sent you in a former Letter if so accept this renewal of the remark as an evidence of its being a truism But then where you will say shall we look for where find such a dispassionate reporter neither influenced by fondness enmity nor languor And if we could find him would his portraits be agreeableeven if they were strong likenesses they would be without the essentials to render them touching We had better I believe yield up the pencil and ourselves to friends and enemiesif the latter give the shades too dark the former can throw in lights to relieve themand if the deadly colouring of the one is too violent and too sombrous the lovely tinting of the other and even the flattering touches which fondness  works into the features will soften away whatever appears too harsh and too heavy  Applying this too the unhappy lady who drew forth the remark I am persuaded she deserves what has been said of her virtues by her friends as much as she  could  do what has been asserted of her by her enemies while both must surely join in lamenting her fate the particulars of which blended with some account of her character are as follow  Her maiden name was Maria Teresa Louisa of Savoy Carignan she married Louis Alexander Joseph Stanislaus of Bourbon Prince of Lamballe President of the Council and a Prince of the Blood The Princess who had formed her attachment to the Queen of France in the day of royal prosperity resolved not to forsake her in the day of distress A series of invitations from some of the first families in England who laid a regular siege for her company yet at last obtained it almost by storm took her from her friend for a short time Her reception in London in the best circles and at court reàched her affections and won her gratitude and pointed out a safe protection from the tempest that began to roll over the  house of Bourbon but none of these had power to hold her from taking her share of peril and distress at Paris to which city she returned where a slight summer friendship would have trembled to approach She found the unhappy Antoinette as she expected to find her surrounded by many insults many dangers and hourly in expectation of more And that such previous knowledge of her august friend's situation was the superior magnet that drew her from the admiration of St James's cannot be doubted since to be partaker of such dangers and insults she quitted such admiration In a word she returned to Paris while every body else of character or of no character were flying from it by stratagem and by every means possible The friendship of courts has been a fruitful and a favourite theme of poets who echo the aspersions of ignorance from one to another Let that of the Princess de Lamballe for the Queen of France stand on record as a proof that such censures even if they were admitted to be generally true have their happy and honourable exceptions And surely no vicious feeling could have at such a moment drawn the one Princess to the other since there is in guilt that sort of dastardy which induces us to leave and escape from its  accomplice in the searching hour of calamity rather than hasten to receive our share and were any wanting I should add this circumstance as a weighty one in evidence of the purity of the principles which united Madame de Lamballe to the Queen  But even in her prisonhouse she not only performed the gentle offices of a friend to the Queenthe general duties of a friend to the indigent were not forgotten Poverty and sorrow were never sent empty or weeping from this amiable Princess and her benevolence was even more than her beauty the subject of admiration the people of Paris in a more especial manner were the objects of it and it was by the hands of that very people in that very city this illustrious visitor was to die in a manner that would have been thought by justice itself too cruel too shocking for the vilest criminal that ever disgraced human life or the laws that protect it  On the third of that September which will ever be enrolled in the history of the world amongst the days that have most disgraced and stained it this unfortunate and exalted woman who had long been imprisoned in the Hotel de  la Force was disturbed by the ruffians of the Republic while she was yet on her bed of straw to leave that dreadful place for another On her telling them she had no fault to find with her present place of confinement they rudely answered she must be transferred to the prison of the Abbey and that she must go without delay adding that her life depended on her obedience She then begged of the leader of these ruffians who was one of the national guard to step aside with his myrmidons while she dressed and that she would attend him In a few minutes she recalled the officer who conducted her through the dungeon to the light the least rays of which that dreadful place excluded They reached the prisondoors the other side of which they had scarce gained when the unhappy Princess found reason for preferring the darkness of her subterraneous cell to longlost day light which presented her with nothing but an  "Assembly  "All made up of villains"  whose faces hands and garments were embrued in blood The murderers were pursuing their desolations under her eyes In short it was in the middle of that tremendous day on which  assassination was the most rapacious Some of the fiercest of these executioners paused from blood to interrogate her to abuse and menace  Alas replied the Princess I have nothing to say whether I die a few days sooner or later Sirs is a matter of indifference to me since I perceive that I am devoted and I am prepared for death  She was then hurried to the tribunal where the president being told she refused to answer questions exclaimed "A way with her to the Abbey" This was a signal for all that was to follow and her executioners did not suffer it to escape Scarce had she passed the first street ere they struck their august victim several times on the back part of the head with a sabre which was covered with bloodthe blood of so many kings and heroes Two wretches then took her arms and obliged her to walk over the dead bodies She fainted at almost every step In this situation they stripped her insulted her forced her to stoop down embrace and kiss the carcasses of the murdered citizens Shocking to say they then mangled her beautiful bosom and refusing to shew her the indulgence of a speedy release stabbed her first in every part they knew not to be vital Unable to bear up any longer she sunk on the earth  when the wanton villainy of the rabble proceeded to the worst and basest extremities After which being asked whether she would yet save herself by cursing the French Queen and family she struggled even with death to exclaim with energy  No neverbless them now and ever  After which turning to her persecutors she said "Behold I am ready" Then dropping on her knees she cried  O God all puissant preserve my friends and receive my soul  It was in this pious moment the butchers cut off her head from which hung those most beautiful tresses to receive the blood It was then stuck upon a pike and carried by one of the wretches while another followed with her lovely hands and generous heart a third bearing her bowels folded round his brutal arms in a wreath of triumph while a fourth fastened her other members to a hurdle and drew them after him It was in this manner they paraded the streets of Paris pausing at every place which contained those who were known most to love and honour this unhappy Princess They first stopped under the windows of the Duke of Penthievre whom they compelled to survey the mutilated limbs of his daughterinlaw and then proceeding to the temple they forced the royal prisoners  to gaze upon their friend and favourite defiled with blood and dishonoured in the dust and when the Queen fainted at the fight the heartless monsters mocked at her anguish and aggravated it by every insult which the sacred reliques of her friend could receive As the horrible procession returned they obliged the passengers whether on foot or in carriages to kiss the head of the Princess and one of the abandoned creatures with a loud voice exclaimed that he had feasted like an emperor having dined on the heart of a beautiful Princess  But all these terrors were alas in the infancy of their crimes or to use the language of patriotism in the dawn of that  indivisible and immaculate  Republic which has since reached the summit of its virtues in the extirpation of the King Queen Princesses and nobles of the land  In the melancholy annals of the world there certainly have been periods of time sufficiently on the memory to leave an afflicting impression That of the Goths and Vandals when they came to take vengeance on the Roman empire or roving from their forest homes  when they sallied like trooping wolves in quest of plunder or of new settlements was a dreadful aera The cruelty of Maximin when by a single act of authority the whole mass of wealth we are told was at once confiscated for the use of the Imperial treasury and the soldiers hardened as they were in acts of violence blushed as the sacrilegious plunder was distributed amongst themthis was another crisis when according to the historians a general cry of indignation was heard imploring vengeance on the common enemy of humankind Ancient tradition but too well authenticated multiplies the examples by hundreds and were we to carry the survey to modern times they would extend to thousands amongst the latter must ever be enumerated the disaffection and dismemberment of the blooming States of America But neither these nor any other in the crimson registers of tremendous occurrences equal the enormities which have been long practised by the French UPON EACH OTHER and taking history  "What history never related cried Robespierre what romance never dared to imagine we have done"  That is very true indeed Mr Robespierre You and your indefatigable coadjutors have outheroded Herod with a

have contrived to turn one of the most extensive nations of the inhabited earth into a butchery  from  the beginning of the world to the present hour the aggregate of offences perpetrated against God and man would justify our pronouncing that the  most  calamitous condition of the human race is to be dated from the aera of the  French Republic during the absolute monarchy of the tyrant Robespierre  When we reflect that these are the times  before us  that we  live in them  that fresh reports and experience of fresh horrors reach our eyes ears and hearts every daythat the now  Liberty reason and

assurance of tranquillity to  you  that are remote than to those who are nearer even than I am now to the immediate scenes of action what hope have we but in  Him  whom the moralist beautifully describes as  holding the reins of the whole creation in his hand and who moderates them in such a manner that it is impossible  for one to break lose upon another  without his knowledge and permission    Thrice happy he who in a general disaster like that which now desolates so large a portion of the globe and from the spreading misery of which no security can be derived from riches honours poverty or innocence happy is he who can say with the man who exemplified at his death the precepts of his life  In such cases I know but one way of fortifying the soul and that is by securing to ourselves the friendship and protection of that Being who disposes of events and governs futurity He sees at one view the whole thread of my existence not only that part of it which I have already past but that which runs forward into all the depths of eternity When I lay me down to sleep I recommend myself to his  care when I awake I give myself up to his devotion Amidst all the evils that threaten me I will look up to him for help and question not but that he will either avert them or turn them to my advantage Though I know neither the time nor the manner of the death I am to die I am not at all sollicitous about it because I am sure that He knows them both and that He will not fail to comfort and support me under them  May sentiments like these soothe every misfortune that my friends my readers and my countrymen may be called upon to bear And may peace revisit the worlda peace founded on real liberty but not upon frantic licentiousness  Such has all along been the private prayer such shall now be the public wish of your ever affectionate friend and servant  THE GLEANER  P SHow far the Divine Power in the wisdom of his sublime and inexplicable dispensations may suffer these instruments of vengeance to proceed it is not for mortals to determine In the mean time one cannot but notice the apparent connexion betwixt the  late events and certain prophetic parts of the sacred writings  In a book called  Liber Mirabilis  written by the Bishop of Arles who died in there are a number of things foretold which seem to warrant our considering the Author not only as a divine but a prophet Amongst other singular predictions respecting his devoted country are the following  "The nobles shall be stripped of their dignities and of their riches  "The proper defenders and protectors of the kingdom shall be constrained to leave it  "There shall be as great an effusion of blood as in the time of the Gentiles  "The church universal and the universe itself shall bewail the destruction and the pillage of one of the most celebrated cities of the earth  "The holy men shall be driven from their sanctuaries  "The virgins shall be polluted and fly from their monasteries  "The church shall be despoiled of its temporals  "The very heads of the nation and the holy temples shall be defiled The mistress of France shall be left desolate  "But the black eagle shall appear and the lion shall come roaring from a far country  "Woe unto thee once opulent city Thou that enjoyest all things in proud abundance thy fated hour will come Woe unto thee city of philosophy Thou wilt see thyself brought low"  The above is given as a literal translation I have not seen the original and offer it you by a German medium How far the prophecy is fulfilled the above faithful accounts and others which must have reached you will testify And wellknowing the gentle virtues of your heart I may exclaim  "Tant d'horreur vous surprend mais de leur barbaric  "Je ne vous conte que le moindre partie  "Tout unite Paris la mort fans resistance  "Couvrit en un moment la face de la France"  If this was true in the days of blood which the Henriade has sung it is more eminently so at this sanguinary period    Voluminous have been the reflections made in the rise and progress of these horrible these unparalleled events The most obvious yet the most perplexing to all reasoning and all order is the consideration that such events happened under the eyes of those who created to themselves new laws new authorities and a new ConstitutionThat at the time when these massacres began the selferected Republican governors were in the full origin of their power and that to have put an end to such disorders in the first instance it would have been a very trifling exertion of such power to have prevented if not the bloody effusions of the tenth of August at least those of the  second third fourth and fifth of September in the tremendous year of one thousand seven hundred and ninety two for in each of the places where the lives of the citizens were taken away the executionersor if they better like the termthe patriotsbutchers did not I am instructed from the best authorities exceed more than between thirty and forty and these  "Made up of wretches  "That look'd as if all hell had drawn them into league"  mercenary robbers condemn'd highwaymen hir'd assassins fellows escaped from the gallies girls of the town and fish women Such were the original active disturbers of the public peace who might have been brought to order with a slight effort of any one of the protectors of the newrais'd republic And to the blush of all those who assumed a share in the infant commonwealth glorious in its design but villainously mangled in its cradle it is to be remembered as an eternal monument of their disgrace that there existed at that crisis even on those bloody days an Executive Power a minister of justice a minister of the interior a mayor a municipality a department a legislative assembly a national guard a commander  in chief of that guardin short the fortyeight sections There does not seem the shadow of an excuse to be made either as men or magistrates for any one of them If the carnage had been perpetrated in an hour they might have said we wanted time for we could not under an hour have put our authorities in force But that carnage continued three days and three nights successively Had the assassins been composed of an army formidable by their numbers the legislative bodies might have said we wanted strength to repel such a force of insurgents but those assassins consisted of an handful of men and women and during the whole time of their assassinations the fortyeight sections were assembled and constantly sitting The National Assembly had power to save two of their own members M M Jancourt and Jonneau why did they not extend their generosity or their justice to the rest These their friends were rescued amidst the outrages of the populace who had proscribed them  With respect to Revolutions in general it may be a curious speculation to trace their merits and their progress  A reform in governments may be absolutely necessary and a revolution has sometimes set out well  There is an instance which is at the same time an example and a very rare one of a revolution  continuing  under those principles and if ever there was one act of dire oppression more infamous than another it is to be found in the  System of Tyranny  under which that injured country has long and is still labouring We talk loudly of Asiatic slavery of the hard fate of the fable race and pitying Europe no less than the Gleaner seems to take the alarm on  then  affecting subject but against the property liberty and lives of these poor people who certainly  have  undeniable and everlasting rights to their own country and the fruits of their own industry and inheritance while they trespass not on the inheritance and industry of other nations against these often and still mark'd victims of  despotism  there is form'd a cruel combination headed by two of the most powerful  despots  both of whom by the bye are amongst the loudest declaimers against the  French  Revolution and by way of supporting this  illustrious inconsistency  one of these powers has one grand army in Brabant to assist in destroying  tyrants  and another grand army elsewhere to exterminate a free and generous people And his IMPERIOUS colleague in this celebrated  bucchanneering  orders and joins in public prayers fasts and festivals to beg of the God of equity to turn the hearts of the French and then at the tag end of this mockery hitches in endways another prayer for the success of her arms against these Unfortunates The first prayer is hypocritical and the last is sincere but the sincerity has if possible less "relish of salvation" in it than the hypocrisy in the degree that it is a greater turpitude to be earnest in a vile cause than simply to  affect  compassion in a good one In this matter however the affectation is intended to give a colour to the earnestness When a plunderer wants an apology in a case of selfinterest pity I mean a piteous prayer which is extremely cheap about the interest of othersPity has a mighty convenient mantle to throw over the shoulders and accordingly the plunderer always makes a spoil of it amongst the rest of the pillage to cover himself and his real designs Unluckily however in the present business the mantle is too thin The noble personage in question has in the course of a long life and reign had so many occasions to put it on and throw it off just as it became commodious or troublesome that it is threadbare in some places and torn in others and though the sublime wearer is dress'd in it at this very moment all the world can  see through it  I have been at some pains to  glean  the great personage above mentioned and have picked up some curious anecdotes And not a few on this very subject and  hypocrisy in benevolence  the public and private instances of which will amuse you when we meet and the whole of which delectable Gleaning is calculated to prove that "  all which glisters is not gold  " and that when a foreign trumpeter whose breath belongs to the power who paid for the trumpet or commanded it to be blown sounds a volleyI can by no means call it a  voluntary  about magnificent presents jewel boxes picture in brilliants c each of immense value it ought to be told at the same time that in certain parts of the world there are mines of sparkling trumpery which the  slave digs  and the  tyrant  gives away just as any wouldbethought generous person in our own country might bestow Bristol stones and pass them off for diamonds In doing which there seems to be no great danger as the receiver conceiving the gift a mark of honour must starve rather than dispose of it But some men there are who do not choose to carry the point of honour quite so far and who maintain that the laws of selfpreservation are stronger and more binding than those of delicacy On this right of nature it has come to the ears of the Gleaner that certain persons have in the last extremity  parted  with their superb keepsakes and lovetokens received from the graciously imperial hands in question and found like the juggler's trick  "Shake but the bag and all seems fair  "The fingers spreadand  nothing's there  "  We know that in some hands both abroad and at home this juggling art has  "Rais'd both fortune and renown"  And that VICE personified in a  female  character was the best juggler after all In a story that I know of a sword set or  said  to be set with brilliants of the first water according to courtarithmetic worth florins the ever honoured receiver  wanting bread  could with difficulty get enough to purchase  ve and twenty loaves and a splendid ring from the same everhonoured giver estimated at l sterling was pronounced by a famous jeweller to have cost about l In short the Gleaner has with very few variations had occasion to apply every instance of Slight in the fable and thinks that the illustrious juggler abovementioned might exclaim with better pretensions than Gay's trickster  "Who dares with me dispute the prize  "  In juggling I submit to none  "  But then this personage has the reason to give which triumphant vice herself made use of and every subordinate trickster crown'd or ancrown'd might observe  "How practice has improv'd her hand  "But now and then  we  cheat the throng  "  She  every day and all day long"  But it is a tempting theme and I am breaking into my Corps de Reserve  as unquestionably did that of France  under the sanctions of reason honour public good and the cause of religion But nine  times out of ten it degenerates into a mere personal quarrel in which public good and  every other generous motive is forgotten to make way for the gratification of private ambition avarice and hatred The original cause in the absorbing ferment of party is speedily swallowed up what was principle becomes passion Or what at the commencement was a brave and daring contest betwixt the governors for prerogative and the governed for privilege a determined assertion of real or supposed rights on the one hand and of natural claims on the other at length settles into a mere party madness And the insanity is contagious Every body catches it Men women and children rave about it The time of reasoning is past consequently the time of entering its causes It is then the business of the individual whatever be his party to follow where that leads to defeat or victory to life or death In the feverish paroxism of indignation each person easily persuades himself his quarrel is just every angry man imagines he has a good  reason to be so and the more we are wandering from the right the more violently and inveterately we insist that the objects of our displeasure and enmity are in the wrong and in public as well as private contention the transition from generous strife to illiberal rancour is almost immediate the slightest wound soon turns into a gangrene Each person becomes odious to one party and honoured by the other as he gives proof of steadiness to his own cause The massacre is called patriotism on the one hand and loyalty on the other and very frequently the object first in contention like the squabble betwixt the two dogs and the shadow is not worth having but meantime it is fought for as fiercely as if it was the one thing necessary to our comfort in this world and our salvation in the next In the end the point is given up and when accounts are cool enough to be reduced to rules of arithmetic it usually turns out that in point of damages each party has suffered in blood and money from thousands up to millions and on the credit side we have nothing to shew for them but units and cyphers  On fair calculation therefore my friend whatever advantage may be derived to posterity  little is to be gained by the present generation Since after every ten years war I mean a civil war of course so much havock has been done to property in general and the passions of hatred have so rankled in the heart privately speaking against friends neighbours and families even in the miserable septennial squabble about elections this is manifest that I question much whether there is a being on the face of the earth except the stockjobbers forestallers agents and other vultures in society who thrive in time of public calamity can expect to be the better for it The ravages usually drain the best blood fortunes and feelings of the country for at least half a century and supposing there is then a regeneration with some few benefits that were not before enjoyed we shall probably have lost many that were better before the reform began Besides the melancholy consideration that our posterity will look upon the party and personal love and hate that has descended to them as part of their inheritance our immediate offspring will have been educated in all the prejudices of our own particular party and the next age will lose little or nothing of hereditary attachment to one side and illwill  to another while remoter generations will trace the history of their forefathers and make what the politics or fashion of the day set down as rights and wrongs the cause of new murmurs new exactions new rebellions new patriotisms and in fine the sparks that will be found in stirring up the embers and ashes of the old world shall serve as a match to burn down the new And knowing my friend what we know of the discontented repining spirit of man knowing that even if God himself does not dispense his sunshine and his showers exactly in proportion to our fancied good we rebel have we not the experience of several thousand years that these fires will be kindled up in human society till the coming of that conflagration which  "Lightnings with the meteor's blaze conspire  "And darted downward set the globe on fire"  Far however am I from wishing to "check the genial current of the soul" that aspires to liberty 'Tis the true state of nature the genuine spirit of life the health beauty and support of society We cannot even extend our ideas beyond the sphere of this world and raise them to another without supposing that  perfect freedom  is the basis of immortal felicity  A despotic heaven is a contradiction in terms indeed the generous struggles of human beings for liberty when wanton cruelty no longer debases her cause are but assertions of the divine part of our nature Those jarring atoms which shake a nation and which are perhaps inseparable from revolutions give way to wise wholesome and humane arrangements and when order is called out of that political chaos though humanity must ever shudder at the dire effect of those convulsions which have preceded such arrangements as tyrants seldom long survive their victims we must venerate the "end while we never cease to deplore some of the means by which it has been brought about"  In fine applying these general observations to the particular instance before us of the French people  "When the dread thirst of blood is o'er  "And RUTHLESS RAGE SHALL STAIN THEIR CAUS  MORE  "With honest joy ALL nations shall embrace  Their Calli  foes and own them of a kindred race"  "FIRM AND IMMOVEAELE ON NATURE'S BASE  "STANDS THE GRAND CHARTOR OF THE HUMAN RACE  "AND HE WHO GAVE US LIFE BADE LIFE BE FREE"  a sacred truth and which not only in the  Humanity  work from whence these lines are copied but in every other work of his hand and movement of his heart has and will ever influence the thoughts conversation or composition however imperfect in other respects of one who is equally a foe to tyranny and cruelty whether in monarchs or multitudes and a friend to liberty Farewell  HUMANITY OR THE RIGHTS OF NATURE A POEM IN TWO BOOKS A NEW EDITION CORRECTED BY THE AUTHOR  PREFACE  WHAT I ventured abroad many years since under the title of SYMPATHYa poem which on account of the interests created in the heart by the subject itself was received by the public with so much generous warmth was INTENDED to serve as a preliminary to what I had farther to observe on SOCIETY or a prospect of the HUMAN RACE under the combined influences of CLIME and GOVERNMENT RELIGIONS LAWS and LIBERTIESFrom these the transition to TYRANNY was natural and strongly in connexion and from TYRANNY I felt myself called upon by all the awakened emotions of HUMANITY to consider SLAVERY but not only that species of it which consists in buying and selling our  FellowCreatures  in  AfricaBUT EVERY OTHER KIND in EVERY OTHER PLACE Views therefore of FREEDOM and BONDAGE throughout the different parts of the globe have been taken as well from experience as the best historical evidence  How far the  entire Abolition  so warmly contended for by the supporters of this measure may be consistent with human policy it is not my purpose particularly to enquire It is not the  name  of Slave in  itself  which produces the great mischief An hired servant in Europe may be as little at his own command and destined to as hard labour as a purchased Negro in Africa but the essential difference consists in the one being guarded by the laws of the land which spread before his person and his property a shield that defends him from every  abuse of power  and the other is left naked and defenceless to the "insolence of office"  HUMANITY requires that the RIGHTS OF NATURE should be enjoyed by every  Human  Being  It is therefore against the shocking barbarity  I am glad however to have it in my power to observe that we have not suffered the HUMANITY of the French and other nations to surpass our own at least in  one  of our islands as the following authentic extract from the Jamaica Councils will attest dated  November  th  "This day the House of Assembly went into a Committee on the Consolidated Slave Bill and continued sitting upwards of three hours we understand that by this Bill the whole system of the law respecting Negrees is entirely changed a Council of Protection is established in each parish and many humane provisions are introduced for rendering their condition easy and happy it is also made felony without benefit of clergy to murder a Slave a clause which to the great honour of the House passed without a single dissenting voice"  the unquestionable cruelty and the too well attested horror growing out of these that I still contendAn abolition of  these enormities  is absolutely necessary For the rest whether the commerce flourishes or falls is a matter of no moment to the Philanthropist without engaging in the heats of political controversy without attending to the pleas of interest on the one side or the sallies of enthusiastic zeal though generous in its excesses on the other it is sufficient to Him that the happiness of the  species  in  general  is  made independent on the tyranny of  particular individuals  that the laws of  subordination  in the different classes of SOCIETY should not violate the laws of  humanity  and that so much of  liberty  should be allowed to every man as to feel a consciousness of his being a link in the great chain of the community and that till by some act of his own it is necessary for the  good of the whole  that he should be considered as an outcast of society he is by the Rights of nature and of Reason entitled to protection from insult misery and death So far as the  wealth  can be reconciled to the  happiness  of nations and the Establishments of Civil  Society  to the Rights of Nature every lover of his country must subscribe at the same time as the  wealth of worlds  cannot justify the least wanton insraction of the  laws of Humanity  whoever vainly attempts to support an argument for the one at the expence of the other erects a building which hath its foundation in the sands and which must tumble into ruins at the slightest touch of Reason and of Truth  HUMANITY  BOOK I  FROM vernal blooms and many a fragrant bow'r  The red'ning blossom and unfolding flower  From breezy

from her sympathy some comfort springs  And joys which reason with a frown denies  Her tender pity with a smile supplies  In thy lone prisonhouse she bids thee draw  From the rush sceptre and the crown of straw  The mimic truncheon and the loveknot true  Full many a transport Reason never knew  Ev'n at thy grated cell she oft appears  She culls thee flowers and bathes them with her tears  The

Where as in ambush lie the chains and whip  Like nested snakes whose poisons are enroll'd  Mid'st wreaths of flowers in many a shining fold  The faithless Spaniard leaves the plunder'd shore  The fraud succeeds and freedom is no more  Then o'er th' affrighted waves is heard the yell  Of mingled thousands in their wat'ry Hell  In the dark caverns of the bark they lie  Live to fresh horrors or by piecemeal die  Thus shut from light unknowing yet their doom  The vessel proves a dungeon and a tomb  While the base tyrant glorying in his snare  Mocks at the loud rebuke and dumb despair  Soon as the vessel bears the tribes away  What horrors seize upon the trembling prey  Ah hear the shrieks of kindred left behind  Roll to the wave and gather in the wind  Matrons with orphans sons with sires appear  But vain the orphans shriek the parents tear  The Spanish robber ploughs the wat'ry plains  And plants his cannon at the thin remains  The flaming balls the wailing natives reach  And added slaughter stains the crimson beach  All all is lost yet still with generous pride  Slaves spurn at life when freedom is deny'd  "Free still be free loud echoes to the sky  Dare not to live in bonds but dare to die"  Then oh ye Christian savages declare  On what unknown prerogative  ye  dare  Peaceful and blest where rich Bananas grew  And nature freshen'd as the seabreeze blew  Where harvests smil'd without the aid of toil  And verdure gladden'd the exuberant soil  Where summer held so bountiful a sway  Scarce claim'd their year the culture of a day  The plants at twilight trusted to the earth  The following morn sprang blooming into birth  Grac'd with the bow the Indians harmless ran  And undisturb'd enjoy'd the rights of man  The rights of man by nature still are due  To men of ev'ry clime and every hue  Their arrows sought the monsters of the wood  The chase at once their pastime and their food  Bower'd by th' umbrageous vine they thought no wrong  Now wreath'd the dance and caroll'd now the song  And oft some sable mistress of the soul  Prepar'd the banquet and partook the bowl  Love's captive only wore fair beauty's chain  And pleas'd submitted to the blissful pain  If giant POWER confers this wanton sway  Subdues the strong and makes the weak obey  Does power give RIGHT beware that dangerous plea  Perchance such power may spread its right to thee  The slave once stronger than thyself shall stand  And seize the sceptre of usurp'd command  Arm'd with thy iron scourge shall bid thee toil  Scar thy white skin and chain thee to the soil  Thy spirit fainting in the glare of day  Shall bid thee naked brave the Syrian ray  Thy scorn retort retaliate all thy rage  Wear out thy youth and murder thee in age  Tear from thy fetter'd arms thy child and wife  And blast the budding promises of life  Repay in turn each stroke thy baseness gave  And make THEE feel what 'tis to be a Slave  Ah false as fatal to the Weak and Strong  Th' inherent rights of nature still belong  No partial principles the just impel  To thinking wisely or to acting well  And liberty of all mankind the cause  Becomes a forfeit  only  to the laws  Those sacred compacts which like links sustain  Connecting parts of the great social chain  And while with these no member is at strise  As full the right to liberty as life  Avaunt assertors of  superior  right  And vain distinctions betwixt  black  and  white  Firm and immovable on nature's base  Stands the grand charter of the human race  And HE who gave the blessing gave it free  Life were a curse if robb'd of Liberty  Whence then this wond'rous difference in our race  Come crested Pride and thy distinction trace  Lo from th' Equator to the northern pole  Tho' colours change unchangeable the soul  If justly bought the man of  deepest  die  By equal laws the  next in shade  we buy  So soft'ning on till scarce a tint between  The haughty lord and humble slave is seen  Springs the vain boast from thy superior WHITE  Vain prepossession of thy partial sight  Beware fallacious reas'ner lest the North  His  whiter  rival sends indignant forth  Ah ruther blushing  hide  thy snowy skin  For know thy slave paints white the sire of  sin  But darker than  himself  he draws the POW'R  The sovereign  good  his sable race adore  Thy cruelty has taught him to despise  Like hell  thy  hue his  own  like heav'n to prize  NATURE and HABIT human kind controul  The needle one and one th' attractive pole  And what in Europe we a grace may call  Is found in Africa no grace at all  And what abhorr'd deformity we name  In many a climate dignifies with same  Survey the various globe from shore to shore  Weigh MANNERS CUSTOMS and be proud no more  Observe how all to fix'd opinion bow  Or fond caprices which no standards know  Thou who would'st fix her to thy pallid face  Behold her beauty shift the ever changeful grace  Here BEAUTY proudly boasts the length'ning head  There on the shoulders bids it broadly spread  Here smallest gems must grace the fair one's ear  And there the pendents large as logs appear  Here see her ask the locks of snowy white  Yet beg the charm of teeth more dark than night  Here must the broaden'd eyebrow shade the face  There softly curv'd the crescent arch must grace  While here again that crescent arch must part  Ev'n from the root and yield to brows of art  Here BEAUTY loves the cheek supremely fair  There boasts the gash and cherishes the scar  In Britain rose and Iilly must unite  While Damian's Isthmus claims the milky white  The beard must here e'en to the girdle flow  There not a bristle must presume to grow  Here the swoll'n body there the slender waift  This wrap'd in silk and that in dogskin grac'd  Here BEAUTY triumphs in her wooly hair  But waves in wreaths her auburn tresses there  To grace the dames of Europe fair they flow  Long and profuse upon a neck of snow  In ev'ry curl a Cupid seems to lie  To aid the conquests of the sparkling eye  The thickest lip here beauty makes her care  More softly swell'd like dewy rosebuds there  The dazzling white is in this clime admir'd  The glossy black in that is more desir'd  Feel humbly then nor deem all grace thy own  Nor think that  Nature  charms in thee alone  The poorest native of the poorest coast  Hath still his beauty still his good to boast  From earth's beginning to its utmost ends  Proportion'd charm proportion'd bliss she sends  Exact division but adapted still  To what in different climes her children feel  To what when undebauch'd by man's desires  Or sancied wants necessity requires  Nor sparing nor yet prodigal her plan  With pois'd equality she blesses man  On the worst soil some heartfelt joy bestows  Which the glad son she there has station'd knows  And what from us extorts the taunting sneer  May to his sense an happiness appear  And the fond gifts which we indulgent deem  To him an aggravated curse may seem  Thus kind is nature in her zone serene  But not more kind than in her torrid scene  Not less a parent where the frozen Power  Resides for centuries in his icy tower  Where the hoar monarch in his vest of snow  Ascends the hills where suns refuse to glow  Vain all dispute of colour form or size  "In pride in reas'ning pride our error lies"  In pride in pride alone the difference lies  Whence then presumptuous man deriv'd thy right  And by what law does olive yield to white  Their nature origin and end the same  Why has not brown black copper equal claim  Tho' shifting colours like their parent earth  Alike their species and alike their birth  If not in  colour  then perchance in  sense  In the  soul  's power may lie the proud pretence  Ah no from Nature's hand all equal came  Thro' ev'ry clime an helpless babe's the same  The same frail emblem of our state appears  A weak and helpless being born in tears  If cultur'd climes refine on nature's plan  They change the mode but never change the man  The human passions strongly are impress'd  In the untutor'd as the polish'd breast  In the swarth African that's bought and sold  As the fair plunderer that steals his gold  Heav'n form'd his eyes to love his native hue  And pointed all his appetites as true  Those sable tints at which with fear we start  Are the lov'd colours that attract his heart  Our polish'd arts refinement may bestow  But oft enfeeble nature's genuine glow  In polish'd arts unnumber'd virtues lie  But ah unnumber'd vices they supply  Here if they bloom with ev'ry gentler good  There are they steep'd with more than savage blood  Here with Refinement if sweet Pity stands  There Luxury round them musters all her bands  'Tis not enough that daily slaughter feeds  That the fish leaves its stream the lamb its meads  That the reluctant ox is dragg'd along  And the bird ravish'd from its tender song  That in reward of all her music giv'n  The lark is murder'd as she soars to Heaven  'Tis not enough our appetites require  That on their altars hecatombs expire  But cruel man with more than beastial power  Must heap fresh horrors on life's parting hour  Full many a being that bestows its breath  Must prove the pang that waits a  ling'ring  death  Here close pent up must gorge unwholesome food  There render drop by drop the smoaking blood  The quiv'ring flesh improves as slow it dies  And Lux'ry sees th' augmented whiteness rise  Some gash'd and mangled feel the torturer's art  Writhe in their wounds tho' sav'd each vital part  Ask you the cause the  food more tender grows  And callous Lux'ry triumphs in the blows  For this are some to raging flames consign'd  While yet alive to sooth our taste refin'd  O power of mercy that suspends the rod  O shame to man impiety to God  Thou polish'd Christian in th' untutor'd see  The sacred rights of sweet HUMANITY  Thine is the World thy crimson spoils enjoy  But let no  wanton  arts thy soul employ  Live tho' thou do'st on blood ah still refrain  To load thy victims with  superfluous  pain  Ev'n the gaunt tyger tho' no life he saves  In generous  haste  devours what famine craves  The bestial paw may check thy human hands  And teach  dispatch  to what thy want demands  Abridge thy sacrifice and bid thy knife  FOR HUNGER KILL BUT NEVER SPORT WITH LIFE  Relief appears as the Muse shifts her place  To where pure manners bless the gentlest race  Lo where the BRAMINS pass their blameless life  Free from proud culture free from polish'd strife  To man brute insect nature's constant friends  The heart embraces and the hand extends  See the meek tribe refuse the worm to kill  No murder feeds them and no blood they spill  But crop the living herbage as it grows  And quaff the living water as it flows  From the full herds the milky banquet bear  And the kind herds repay with pastures fair  From sanguine man they drive the game away  From sanguine man they save the finny prey  The copious grain they scatter o'er the mead  The bird to nourish and the beast to feed  The flowers their couch their roof the arching trees  And peaceful nights succeed to days of ease  O thou proud Christian aid fair nature's grace  And catch compassion from the Bramin race  Their kind extremes and vegetable fare  Their tender maxims all that breathe to spare  Suit not thy cultur'd state but  thou  shouldst know  Like them to save unnecessary woe  Like them to give each generous feeling birth  And prove the  friend  not  tyrant  of the earth  O sweet HUMANITY might pity sway  All all like Bramins would thy voice obey  All need alas thy tender help below  To heighten rapture and to solace woe  One leans on all for aid not all on one  What worm so feeble as proud man alone  The veriest giant by himself is found  Frail as the reed that every breeze can wound  But even the pigmy with associates join'd  Strong as the oak can brave the rudest wind  The SOCIAL PASSION opens with our breath  Pursues thro' life and follows us to death  See as yon infant lull'd in slumber lies  How the fond mother to its cradle flies  Soft on her faithful breast reclines its head  Her faithful breast its banquet and its bed  Tho' many a suffering for its sake she bore  They all but serve to make her love it more  For soon a  kindred  passion  equal  burns  The parent's tenderness the child returns  Runs by her side or struggles to her knee  And owns the touch of fair HUMANITY  The child arrived at man the parent lies  Sick'ning at life in haste her offspring flies  And when at length the mother yields to fate  Stretch'd round her breathless form the affections wait  In mute distress and with uplifted hands  The child she cradled at her coffin stands  Invokes her spirit to assuage the woe  And teach him patience to endure the blow  Blesses the holy shade which gave him birth  Moves to the grave and views the opening earth  A filial shudder thro' his frame he proves  As the dust falls upon the dust he loves  Then as the time steals on with thieflike power  And brings to  him  the allsubduing hour  Himself  ere this a parent soon shall prove  The soft'ning offices of  filial  love  Soon those who owe  him  life shall weeping bend  And his attracting couch as fondly tend  Watch his dim'd eye observe his changing cheek  And drink his dying breath to hear him speak  As sainted sounds of oracles divine  His latest accents in their hearts enshrine  Thus shall he  feel  the tenderness he  gave  And equal tears fall fast upon his grave  Tyrants o'er brutes with ease extend the plan  And rise in cruelty from beast to man  Their sordid policy each crime allows  The flesh that quivers and the blood that flows  The furious stripes that murder in a day  Or torturing arts that kill by dire delay  The fainting spirit and the bursting vein  All all are reconcil'd to Christian gain  In cold barbarian apathy behold  Sits the slaveagent bending o'er his gold  That base contractor for the chain and rod  Who buys and sells the image of his God  Callous to ev'ry touch that nature lends  The bond that ties him to his kind he rends  Robber at once and butcher of his slaves  Nor grief nor sickness age nor sex he saves  But plung'd in traffic coldly can debate  The parent's destiny the infant's fate  The teeming mother of her hope despoil  And poise the gains of childbirth or of toil  The sighs and groans which spring from both he spurns  For life or death 'tis gold the balance turns  Although in conformity to the change in the  time  the Author has chang'd the  tense  in this Apostrophe he trusts he shall not be understood as intimating that the late good and unhappy Louis XVI was a tyrant The tyranny was then in the Conslitution and fatally for him the public Indignation broke out during his mild and perhaps too merciful reign  O Pride and Avarice of deluded fools  Despotic maxims taught in foreign schools  Where late the science of a slave was taught  To check the growth of every generous thought  Where one proud mortal own'd the subject breath  Whispers were treason and a word was death  Tenets like these to polish'd  See the Note inserted at the close of this and the next apostrophe  France belong  For all she licens'd was the dance and song  The hands were setter'd tho' the feet were free  And clos'd the lips in dread of tyranny  The poor proud subject still was idly gay  Skipp'd off his thoughts and humm'd his cares a way  As the cag'd bird tho' pris'ner till it die  Will sometimes sing altho' it may not fly  Thy tree O LIBERTY forbade to taste  A Frenchman's richest genius ran to waste  Oft were the seeds of freedom in his soul  But none could spring amid such hard controul  In life's fresh morn if chance they dar'd to shoot  The bud scarce peep'd ere Power destroy'd the root  Ah what can prosper in a slavish soil  Save stinted shrubs unworthy of the toil  Like pallid sweets of ineffectual May  That faintly bloom and wither in a day  Not so the plants which LIBERTY bestows  That in our Albion's favor'd garden grows  There lifts the oak its top into the skies  While with glad heart the Briton sees it rise  Uninjur'd there for ages shall it stand  Nor ever quit it but to guard the land  Then on the deep in gallant pomp it moves  To serve that freedom which its country loves  Oh ever sail fair Bark upon thy waves  Still guard thy England from a realm of slaves  Oh ever flow fair Sea to guide our coast  Still to divide us from yon abject host  And swell ye Cliffs that canopy our strand  To frown indignant on that servile land  That land of mutes of one proud Lord the prey  A clime where to be dumb is to obey  Unheard unseen where wretches meet their dooms  For whom no tear must dare to bathe their tombs  Conceal'd the parent's pang the lover's sighs  Bastiles for ever frown before their eyes  Like those they mourn down precipices thrown  Are all that venture nature's laws to own  Buried alive from youth to age they lie  And ev'n at last in agonies they die  Such was the Character of France in the  old  and though it is not applicable to the  new  EXCESS either extreme the Author considers as  equally fatal  to that Rational Liberty he wishes to see established amongst Human Beings  Oh hail'd by men and angels be the hour  Which clipp'd my Country's wing when stretch'd for power  Which taught the monarch where his rights should end  And to what point the subjects should extend  Bade the encroacher know his proper sphere  Or for each wrong the monarch subject fear  Once Kings controul'd the law in infant times  Plunder'd at will nor answer'd for their crimes  Freedom's fair system snaps the tyrant's chains  Corrects his nature and his rage restrains  As the small acorn to a forest grows  By gradual steps Britannia's glory rose  Mark by what stern varieties of fate  Terrors of war and anarchies of state  What direful griefs by foreign fury bred  Rivers of blood and mountains of the dead  She past advent'rous ere her wrongs were o'er  Complete her triumphs and confirm'd her pow'r  Behold the painted natives of our isle  Rough as the coast uncultur'd as the soil  Halfnaked and halfcover'd see them go  For sport or war accouter'd with the bow  The plumy helmet nodding on the head  And the loose skin across the shoulders spread  A rude SOCIETY without a plan  Above the brute yet scarce arriv'd at man  But then e'en then was felt the patriot flame  And from these sparks our noontide radiance came  To guard the huts that stretch along the strand  Arm'd with the scythe and wicker shield they stand  The chariot mount or leap upon the ground  And shout victorious to the trumpet's sound  The hardy Chiefs e'er Romes proud Host defy  For Britain conquer or for Britain die  Thus in the earliest hour of England's morn  A Briton's hate of tyranny was born  Abhorrence sacred to repel the hand  That dar'd to wrong the charter of the land  Hence rose our liberties and hence our laws  The Good was common common was the Cause  Yet conflicts murders massacres ensu'd  And many a Saxon Danish sword embrued  In English blood and many a monarch's life  And many a Monk's submitted to the strife  Ere Laws were fix'd as  now  sublime they stand  The shield the spear and buckler of the land  At length bloom'd forth diffusing all their charms  The arts of peace more strong than those of arms  Like mists dispersing at the dawn of day  Barbaric Ignorance refin'd away  The sword was sheath'd the trumpet heard no more  And the Lyre tried its humanizing power  Religion came the Idol to explode  And rear'd her Altar to the Living God  In place of Deities with frowns pourtray'd  Cherubs appear'd with heavenborn smiles array'd  Hence wise and potent aweful and humane  The Christian System holds the guideing rein  Prop of HUMANITY and seen from far  Bright as the lustre of the morning star  Thrice hail thou  Alfred  hero of the Saxon line  Britannia's LAWS Britannia's FREEDOM's thine  Enrich'd by Nature and adorn'd by art  Thine were the varied powers of head and heart  Thine by a kind felicity of fate  The reconcil'd extremes of  Good  and  Great  Conduct with Courage thought with action join'd  And all the Virtues temper'd and combin'd  Ardent in war in gentle peace serene  Wise in the public as the private scene  Coolness to plan and vigour to pursue  And born to mould a rugged state anew  Whate'er Philosophy has drawn sublime  Or poets sung in all the pride of rhime  Whatever history of good has giv'n  The Boast of nature and the smile of Heav'n  Adorn'd thy youth and to complete the plan  And give the perfect model of a man  Nature bestow'd each fascinating grace  The princely stature and attracting face  Then in the noblest light her work to bring  In times of trial stamp'd thee for a King  Scarce shone the crown upon thy princely head  Ere rapine paus'd and foul disorder fled  And when compell'd to quit the regal seat  Still like thyself was sought the soft retreat  Veil'd by the shepherd cot and clown's attire  Still glow'd within thee all the patriot's sire  Dismiss'd the regal pomp its train resign'd  No fate could sink the  monarch in thy mind  The kingly glories  there  their state maintain'd  There unsubdu'd majestic Virtue reign'd  Expiring LIBERTY engag'd thy care  For her to heav'n still breath'd thy servent prayer  Beneath the humblest shed she fill'd thy breast  The humblest shed ennobled by the guest  There while th' unconscious neatherd toil'd and sung  The dart was pointed and the bow was strung  Then while thy country's foes repos'd supine  Again in arms the Foe beheld thee shine  Th' Invaders soon a Conqueror allow'd  And every haughty Lord to ALFRED bow'd  To Arts as Arms thy Genius led the way  And the glad Olive mingled with the bay  Of social Life too thine the faultless plan  Foes warm'd to friends and man acknowledg'd man  Fair Times when monarchy was happiness  When Rule was Freedom and when Power could bless  'Twas thine to call where'er the atoms lay  The Rights of honest Nature into day  'Twas thine O royal architect at length  To give her Charter beauty softness strength  Till on a firm foundation Freedom stood  And Reason saw that all was fair and good  END OF THE FIRST BOOK  HUMANITY  BOOK II  PROUD of the contrast with indignant lay  Once more O Muse to Gallia bend thy way  Explore you Cavern frowning on the sight  Where one faint lamp sends forth a sickly light  Through folds of darkness where yon wicket glooms  Perfidious POWER has scoop'd the living tombs  Along the filth that oozes from the walls  The slimy snail with track aborrent crawls  And oft augmenting poisons from the top  With sullen sound falls slow the withering drop  The pestilential toad that squats below  Gathers fresh venom as those poisons flow  How does HUMANITY triumph in the annihilation of this impious mansion of desp  tism▪ on the first suggestion of these thoughts how little did the Author imagine the Triamph was so near  Here many a fathom down despotic rage  Hung human victims in the dreadful cage  Here the poor Captive torn from child and wise  From youth to age groan'd out detested life  Nor nature's sun nor arts supplying blaze  E'er stole one beani of comfort on his days  Nor human form nor human hand was nigh  To sooth the grief that gather'd in his eye  Save one brief glance of man as thro' the hole  His daily bread the silent goaler stole  No human voice beguil'd the endless night  That cruel shut him from creation's light  To sooth a mistress wanton Louis gave  To one who dar'd be just this lingering grave  To one who dar'd a prostitute pourtray  And bring his honest Satire into day  How sinks the heart to pace this gloomy round  How pants the Muse to leave this tyrant ground  But ere she turn to Afric let her fly  Where slav'ry groans beneath the sairest sky  To desolated ASIA once the blest  In every charm of lavish nature dress'd  The holy spot by many a prophet trod  Seat of the saints and sojourn of the God  Where FAITH her Christian temples rear'd around  And blood of Martyrs sanctified the ground  Where ev'n REDEMPTION like a Cherub came  And REVELATION spread th' enlight'ning flame  But oh thou Land of Heav'n itself belov'd  What dire events what changes hast thou prov'd  How has time alter'd ev'ry charm of youth  Since first thou heard'st the oracles of truth  Disgrac'd the truths which all th' Apostles gave  Thy Prince a tyrant and Thyself a slave  Forgot the Heavenly claims that once were thine  Forgot the precepts breath'd from lips divine  Vain all the fathers all a Saviour taught  And God expell'd for what th' Impostor brought  Ah what avails thy medicinal floods  Thy citron breezes and thy palmy woods  What tho' the Cassia breathes along thy shore  And trickling manna adds its essenc'd store  Tho' gums balsamic in thy vallies grow  And both the Indias in thy region glow  Thine tho' Olympus dear from classic fame  And honour'd Hermon a more holy name  Tho' the tall Cedar decks thy fragrant shrine  And lofty Lebanon himself be thine  From fair Euphrates ev'n to Jordan's wave  Tho' thy rich Coast the hallow'd waters lave  And tho' thy fruits voluptuously dispense  A keener relish to th' invited sense  Tho' on thy flowers a bolder bloom prevail  Which sends more piercing odours to the gale  And tho' thy skies yet salient and serene  Call fair Hygea to the tempting scene  All all these blessings a strong balance find  In one broad curse that seizes on thy kind  Nor this the Pest that oft has thinn'd thy plains  O'er thy devoted land a TYRANT reigns  More fell more fatal than thy torrid sun  Fierce thro' the East see DESPOTISM run  Frantic before him move a sanguine band  The ruthless agents of his murd'rous hand  Crouching behind in dumb allegiance wait  Nurs'd up in blood his various tools of fate  In varied shapes of cruelty they rise  To torture life or hideous deaths devise  Dey Sultan Signior Emperor and King  Chief Visier Cailif each inferior Thing  Some do his bidding in the noon of day  And some at midnight seize upon his prey  Submission terror chastisement combine  To sink the abject vassal to the swine  Below degraded instinct Reason falls  And Man is bound like herds within the stalls  His spirit dies subdued by hard controul  The useless body moves without a soul  No spark of heav'nly fire the mass can warm  Nor public virtue touch nor private charm  But general cowardice by horror bred  Courage unstrung and manly honour dead  For oh the dart the gibbet and the wheel  Are the least terrors that a slave can feel  Of these the anguish scarce can rage its hour  Ere Death appears in soft relief of power  Death a kind refuge in the last despair  But long a LIFE of SLAVERY who can bear  Lo PERSIA's tyrant with unnatural strife  To please a minion robs a child of life  With savage rage can blind the firstborn son  And partial lift a second to the throne  When the proud Sopha has consign'd to death  Tis treason but to beg a parent's breath  The sentence past the  look  that aims to save  Condemns to equal fate the pitying slave  Sensual religion aids the tyrant's will  And blood for ever reeks along the steel  In dire suspence like Damocles's sword  By a slight thread hangs lifea TYRANT's word  Imposts and Edict vex the groaning land  And ev'n the fountain flows but at command  Oh hapless Asia while such horror reigns  What British Muse will rest upon thy plains  Yet should she steer again to AFRIC's sand  There too she sees Oppression lift his hand  Within the tropics fiercer than the blaze  That sires the earth with iron rod he sways  Ev'n from the fertile Nile to Niger's waves  'Tis but a change of tyrants and of slaves  O pride enormous impudence of man  But let not Britons imitate the plan  Frame no false systems and then call them wise  Or make distinctions where no difference lies  Alas full oft the European face  Masks a mind darker than the darkest race  The Negro's heart may be a purer shrine  For thoughts devout O haughty White than thine  Acceptance find more gracious from its God  Than the proud master who uplists the rod  His prayer to holy KANNO more prevail  To the great SPIRIT whispering in the gale  His pious vows to QUOJA 'midst the trees  Or high BASSEFO walking in the breeze  These may more virtues and more truth impart  Than Christian incense from a savage heart  And the wild Tambour beat to idol shouts  To heav'n ascend before the organ's notes  Say what the pomps of science or of prayer  If the poor Indian's  fervor  glows not there  In different forms tho' men the God adore  Shap'd as the brute or painted as the flow'r  As marble here and there as feathers seen  There the birds bone and here the fishes fin  Each as it marks  sincerity  shall rise  And welcome find in the recording skies  Shall more be cherish'd by the powers of Heav'n  Than less true worship where more aids are giv'n  Than the mock homage of th' enlighten'd train  For whom a Saviour liv'd and died in vain  A doctrine this too harsh for human pride  Resort to facts and be the doctrine try'd  With faithful hand cull'd from th' historic page  Proofs throng to proofs might vanquish Christian rage  Oh tyrant WHITE forget awhile thy gold  And every virtue in thy BLACK behold  All that is honour'd lov'd or priz'd by thee  In thy scourg'd Negro blushing shalt thou see  Lo as the Muse to Anticosta steers  Mid'st the wild waves HUMANITY appears  Escap'd the wreck although their barks were lost  Whole crews were dash'd upon a savage coast  The coast tho' savage there the Christians find  Each Godlike feeling in an Indian mind  For touch'd by cries that pierc'd the piny wood  The natives sought the margin of the flood  Then as th' expiring Christians caught their view  To human grief the generous Indians flew  The social passion glowing in his face  Thus spoke a Chieftain of the sable race  "Haste children haste behold where brothers lie  "Rise strangers rise the hand of help is nigh  "Men like ourselves throughout the globe command  "The shelt'ring bosom and the aiding hand  "All all are kinsmen of a different hue  "Our faces vary but our hearts are true  "Ye poor white wanderers on our bounty thrown  "Your griefs are sacred and your wants our own"  This said he gently to his Cottage led  Smil'd on his guests and yielded up his bed  Then watch'd till morn a guardian at the door  Bless'd and was blessed  could a Christian more  To trace each VIRTUE thro' the sultry Sands  Next Negro HONOUR all thy praise demands  In CUJOE's generous soul it meets the view  And darts a glory thro' his tawny hue  A band of Christian pirates sought the shore  And many an Indian from their forests bore  To CUJOE's cot a Foe was seen to fly  Pierc'd by a dart and begg'd in peace to die  But soon the Tribes pursue demand their prey  "Scalp scalp that wretch they cry in open day  "CUJOE conceals the Man whose blood is ours  "'Tis not our rage 'tis justice that devours"  Mean time th' exhausted Christian gasp'd for breath  As Cujoe rose and stopp'd th' impending death  "My Friends forbear the guilty seek and slay  "Pursue the race that stole our tribes away  "May Ocean whelm them in the deepest wave  "The guilty punish but the blameless save  "Lo this sick Christian on my faith relies  "Of Guest and friend ah reverence the ties  "Here in the rights of Friendship shall he rest  "This arm his buckler and his shield this breast  "This Cot his Citadel and ere  he  die  "Here must your hatchets fall your arrows fly"  Honour prevail'd their vengeance dy'd away  And safe in CUJOE's hut the Christian lay  Next let us speed to yonder sainted plains  By mountains screen'd and crown'd with dulcet canes  Where the mad Ouragan in phrenzy roars  Affrights the Isle and desolates the shores  While many a rill and flow'ry vale between  Smile in the storm and reconcile the scene  There see a Hero of the Negro line  Boasts an high FEELING Briton proud as thine  The faithful QUASHI with his master bred  The same their mansion and the same their bed  Together us'd in infant times to play  Their friendship strengthen'd in life's riper day  The slave was trusty and the lord was kind  To QUASHI's care the property assign'd  His labours clos'd he took the transient rest  Then chid the Sun yet loit'ring in the East  Ere peep'd the dawn his daily toils he sought  And daily wealth to his lov'd lord he brought  Envy at length a poison'd arrow drew  Which wing'd with mischief to the master flew  Of dire neglect the accusation came  And lo the sentence past for QUASHI's shame  A public punishment was now decreed  And the next Morn was QUASHI doom'd to bleed  The injur'd Slave with shudd'ring terror heard  And at deep midnight sought his barbarous Lord  Then wrought to agony these words address'd  The poignard trembling at his Master's breast  "O Thou whom no rememberance can move  "Nor cradled tenderness nor manly love  "Dare not to think that QUASHI's soul will bear  "The public Insults which thy hands prepare  "Think not the bloody Morn these eyes shall view  "Nor think for pardon that these lips shall sue  "No Monster no my soul's above my fate  "Scorns thy proud mercy as it braves thy hate  "Thus Tyrant thus thy fury I defy  "Live Thou to Shame while I in honour die"  He spokethe Poignard sluic'd the crimson flood  And bath'd the Master in the Servant's blood  If thou would'st Negro TENDERNESS behold  Seek with the Muse the coast where broods the gold  A  Snelgrave  Briton thereimmortal be his name  By pity's Angel mark'd with endless fame  A Briton there an Indian Infant found  For savage rites by superstition bound  The Negro King amidst the croud he sought  And at the Sacrifice the victim bought  Then to the Ship his trembling Charge convey'd  While all the sable train with awe survey'd  But scarce the Babe was plac'd upon the deck  Than loud was heard a female's piercing shriek  "'Tis he 'tis he it is the babe I bore  "Whom savage Acqua from this bosom tore  "Ah come my ownresume thy couch of rest  "And cling once more to this maternal breast  "Blest be the hand by EGHO form'd to save  "Thrice bless the Hand that led me here a slave  "Blest be the Author of these transports wild  "And blest the power which has restor'd my Child"  She could no more but still the speaking eye  Own'd the rich gift of sweet HUMANITY  But when she heard her infant had been bought  Ev'n as the flame its tender limbs had caught  "O Indian God Oh Godlike White she said  While o'er her fable cheek the crimson spread  "All that a parent all a slave can give  "O Godlike White O Indian God receive"  Kneeling she wept then kiss'd her rescu'd Child  While in her jetty arms the Infant smil'd  Dances and Songs of Praise now struck the waves  And one strong charm like magic touch'd the slaves  Thro' the long voyage obedient they remain  Nor sounding whip is heard nor clanking chain  Touch'd is thy heart O Merchant of thy kind  Does human Softness steal into thy mind  Rous'd is the spark too long repress'd by Gold  Then bend thy heart to what we next unfold  Now while perchance the human passions move  O view the force of friendship and of Love  In Negro bosoms see those powers at strife  Which form the bliss and agony of life  ZEBRON and ZABOR of the jetty race  Were first in feature and proportion'd grace  Bright as the Antelope their radiant eyes  As the proud Palmtree tow'r'd their equal size  Both wore alike the Tyger's speckled spoil  Brothers in dress in pastime and in toil  Slaves tho' they were ev'n Slav'ry had its charms  For ZEBRON's comfort was in ZABOR's arms  And ZABOR fainting on the arid sand  Was rear'd to Joy by gentle ZEBRON's hand  By bliss united much by sorrow more  A Negro's Fate they soften'd while they bore  But Love at last a keener pang imparts  For fable ZELIA triumph'd o'er their hearts  Her skin of Ebony bestow'd a grace  That far outshone an alabaster face  So thought the youths with equal truth inspir'd  With all their passion all their climate fir'd  Each scorn'd to ravish each refus'd to yield  And Love and Friendship both maintain'd the field  Devouring torments spread the mutual flame  But still their friendship still their love the same  When beauteous ZELIA in their view appears  ZEBRON and ZABOR melt in mutual tears  Oft both embracing to renounce her swear  And Friendship seems to link them in despair  At length their conflicts big with every grief  And ev'ry passion sought a dire relief  At close of day as ZELIA trac'd the wood  The Lovers follow'd and before her stood  The wand'ring Maid too fatal in her charms  Now snatch'd to ZEBRON's now to ZABOR's arms  The fondest vows that ever Lovers swore  The deepest groans that ever heav'd they pour  Then with clos'd eyes and heads declin'd they dart  The mutual daggers in her bounding heart  Speechless she fell her sobs their shrieks confound  They clasp the victim and they kiss the wound  Then raise the poignards streaming in her blood  And with their own augment the crimson flood  Thus Negro Virtues Negro Frailties shine  Say  fairer  Savage do they yield to thine  Their ardent virtues emulate thy own  Their errors are the errors of their zone  And art thou still Supreme of human race  Still boasts thy Nature the imperial grace  Ah no without the aid of borrow'd arts  Worth greatness goodness elevate  their  hearts  The tow'ring spirits in their bosoms move  They hate with vigour as with force they love  Together leagu'd till death they faithful toil  And smooth the wrong that chains them to the soil  Still hand in hand their direful loads they bear  Divide each joy and mitigate despair  Vivid as Thine the sense of joy and pain  Thrills in each pulse and vibrates in each vein  When hope inspires behold as bright a ray  Illumes their eyes and o'er their features play  When grief assails the tears as copious flow  To mark the soft or agonizing woe  When the lash scourges or the pincers rend  A shriek as piercing from the heart they send  Ere the brave spirit of the man is broke  Ev'n with a Briton's scorn they spurn the yoke  Love of their native Land that magic charm  Against a host hath made a handful arm  They love like Thee the soil that gave them birth  And treasure up each particle of earth  Fondly embosom'd ere they leave the shore  And kiss the sacred relique o'er and o'er  Muficians Poets too by nature taught  A song spontaneous bursting from a thought  Swift into measure subjects seem to fly  As transient objects transient themes supply  Each nerve extatic springs to the rebound  And every motion seems to paint a found  The sweet enthusiasm ev'ry grief beguiles  And the scourg'd Captive even in anguish smiles  With thrilling passion ev'ry feature glows  So strong the charm it cheats awhile their woes  Yet who the Negro's  sufferings  can relate  Or mark the varied horrors of their fate  Where blushing Truth shall we their griefs begin  Or how commence the catalogue of Sin  Demons of torture ye who mock at woe  And smile to see the crimson bloodtrack flow  In horrid triumph rise from central Hell  Th' inventive pangs of Christian growth to tell  Oh aid the shuddering Muse to paint the grief  Which calls on death for pity and relief  Oh powers of Mercy loose that massy yoke  Oh hold that Arm for murder's in the stroke  Behold that axe the quivering limb assails  Behold that body weltering in its wails  Ah hear that Bludgeon fall that lash resound  And see those wretches writhing on the ground  See yonder mangled mass of Atoms lie  Behold that Christian's hands the flames apply  At the bare feet is laid that sulphurous train  It Climbs the heart and burns into the brain  Survey the triple horrors of their state  Doom'd in each change to be the sport of fate  Torn from their native land at first they come  And then are thrown into the failing tomb  In wat'ry dens like coupled beasts they lie  And beg the mournful privilege to die  But Death more kind than Man oft brings relief  Releases one while one survives to grief  The living wretch his dead associate sees  The body clasps and drinks the putrid breeze  Chain'd to the noxious corpse till rudely thrown  In the vex'd sea then left a slave alone  Ah wretch forlorn  thy  lot the most severe  Assassination would be mercy here  Methinks I hear thee cry "Ah give me death  "Give the last blow and stop this hated breath  "Oh for a sword to waft me to the shore  "Where never Christian White may torture more  "Curse curse me not with Being instant throw  "This loathsome body to the waves below"  His prayer deny'd condemn'd 'midst slaves to groan  The cruel Merchant "marks him for his own"  The scar by Christian cruelty imprest  Smoaks on his arm or blackens on his breast  The wattled oziers form his rugged bed  And daily anguish earns his daily bread  Short food and shorter rest and endless toil  Above the scourge below the burning soil  Soon with his sable Brothers must he go  "Doom'd to a sad variety of woe"  Like harness'd Mules o'er Afric's dreadful sand  In slow procession move the mournful band  The length'ning files begin their circuit wide  While on their limbs are galling braces ty'd  Fraught with coarse viands see the straining throng  Drag the oppressive caravan along  The massy iron and the direful log  Their naked bodies ev'n in slumber clog  An iron collar o'er each neck is past  And iron rivets hold the collar fast  A tighten'd chain across each shoulder goes  While the dark driver takes his own repose  At length arriv'd the miserable band  Like the stall'd oxen pass from hand to hand  Ye friends of Man whose fouls with mercy glow  Throb not your breasts with sympathising woe  Fires not the social blood within your veins  To make the White Man feel the Negro's pains  Beat not your hearts the miscreant arms to bind  Of the proud Christian with a savage mind  Dost thou not pant to snap the impious chain  And rush to succour the insulted train  From servile bonds to free the hapless race  And fix the haughty tyrants in their place  Make  them  the weight of Slav'ry to know  Till their hard natures melt at social woe  Nor till they humanize to social men  Would ye restore them to their rights again  Oh FREEDOM sacred Goddess who inspires  Th' untutor'd Savage with sublimest fires  Oft have the Chiefs o'er lifted troops prevail'd  And Nature's warriours sped where armies fail'd  While the bought soldier in his trade of death  With sordid contract bargains for his breath  While the brave Indian from his fetters broke  Ev'n Famine braves to feel no more the yoke  What will not FREEDOM's Heav'n descended fire  In cultur'd or untutor'd Souls inspire  The RIGHTS OF NATURE and of GOD to save  Men scoop the rock and build upon the wave  Explore the barren sand the marshes drear  And the free Cottage in the desert rear  Delight in hollow of some cave to dwell  Or dig thro' Earth the independent cell  See where MARINO lifts her craggy brow  Half hid in clouds and cover'd half with snew  Beyond the Appenines there Freedom reigns  And scorns the thraldom of Italian plains  There see untax'd the proud republic grow  And spurn the bondage of the vales below  Close on the liberal Heav'n behold it stands  And looking scorn on tributary lands  What tho those tributary lands display  The bloomy fragrance of perpetual May  Like the coy sensitive each lovely flower  Still seems to tremble at the touch of power  Blest be the good Dalmatian's generous earth  Which boasts Oh Rome than thine a nobler birth  Thou but the refuge of a robber band  To his devotion rais'd the folded hand  And many a century his little state  Has stood the storms of Fortune and of Fate  Whilst thy sunk cities once the boast of Fame  Are mark'd by Ruins and an empty name  What tho' no streams here lave the scant domain  But melting snows and reservoirs of rain  Tho' hillocks scatter'd round the parent hill  At once thy pride and penury reveal  A marrow circuit and a labour'd soil  Which yields subsistance but to endless toil  Dear is the grain that decks the Mountain's side  Beyond the harvest of Italia's pride  In this small spot behold one path alone  Where jealous freedom guides us to the town  There entering arts and arms and trade we view  For ev'ry Citizen's a Soldier too  There laws are form'd on patriot Wisdom's plan  For each enjoys the honest rights of Man  There all for general happiness combine  To that great aim with hands and hearts they join  Oh sainted founder of this virtuous land  Sublimely rais'd I see thy statue stand  Ev'n where the Virgin consecrates the place  It fills with holy zeal thy generous race  With freeborn men thy Mount is cover'd o'er  While lost CAMPANIA glooms a desert shore  Say what but FREEDOM chear'd the Savage bands  That once o'erspread CANADIA's conquer'd lands  Wild as their woods behold uncheck'd they go  For sport or food accouter'd with the bow  They ask'd no bounty from the sullen soil  The casual chace their banquet and their toil  And when at eve the warm pursuit was o'er  Nor twang'd the bow nor sped the arrow more  They sprung from light repose ere peep of day  And thro' the humid desarts took their way  Active ferocious bold unaw'd they stood  Troops of the lake and armies of the wood  Vers'd in no science lesson'd in no art  They breath'd the eloquence that reach'd the heart  Unknown the classic pomp of pedant schools  Above th' ungenial check of colder rules  It beam'd defiance in the flashing eye  Storm'd in the shout and melted in the sigh  In tranquil hours it gave the smile serene  In public tumults show'd th' indignant mien  While every vivid tone and glance express'd  All the strong passions of the warriour's breast  When the rude Chief his brave harangue began  The Savage rose to Hero and to Man  And when th' invader tore him from the soil  Dear scene of all his pride of all his toil  No artificial mockeries of woe  Or taught his cheek to change his tears to flow  With pious awe he kneel'd to kiss the ground  And fondly press'd his sorrowing friends around  "Oh weeping Brothers this our place of birth  "Our fathers Ashes consecrate the earth  "Should the foe drag us to a foreign shore  "Those sacred ashes we can guard no more  "Leave leave not thus our Sires to Christian rage  "But ah with filial wrath the conflict wage"  Thus thro' the globe in Nature's earliest dawn  For FREEDOM only was the arrow drawn  The plain rough ancient at his threshold stood  And held that freedom dearer than his blood  Whate'er the forest or the lakes bestow  Fruits of his lance his angle and his bow  The fur that warms him or the hut that shields  The scanty harvest which his culture yields  Earn'd by his strength was by his strength maintain'd  And Freedom held what honest labour gain'd  Part of himself the Swain his Freedom thought  His reason sanction'd what his nature taught  Nor force of bribes nor frauds of gold he knew  For Life and Liberty to arms he flew  For these see smiling in their realms of frost  The sons of Labradore's inclement coast  Tho' darkness sheds deep night thro' half the year  And snow invests the climethat clime is dear  Where blows the arctic tempests icy gale  And famine seizes on the spermy whale  The bearded Esquimaux half robb'd of sight  Roves uncontroul'd content with FREEDOM's light  To all the ills his Country knows conforms  Sports in her caverns and enjoys her storms  For the huge Seadog tugs the lab'ring oar  Nor sighs for blessings of a softer shore  Such too BRITANNIA were THY savage Sons  Thro' all thy tribes the dread of Slav'ry runs  Tho' mild heroic honest without laws  They brav'd each peril in fair Freedom's cause  But ah full many an age in Gothic night  Was veil'd th' effulgence of their native right  Tho' like the rocky Barrier of their coast  That Freedom now is her sublimest boast  Full many an age dissension shook her Fane  From Rome's fierce Caesar to the stormy Dane  In whelming tides pour'd in the Saxon clan  And Normans finish'd what their rage began  The savage Briton to his Mountains fled  Alternate triumph'd and alternate bled  War upon wars on conquest conquests throng  Vandal drove Goth and Goth urg'd Gaul along  On human flesh the savage Victors eat  And mistic Druids shar'd the sanguine treat  Impostorpriests before their Idols stood  And talk'd of Heav'n with hands embru'd in blood  Before their eyes imagin'd spectres glare  Spirits were heard and fancy'd ghosts were there  Religion Law and Government their own  Bloody their Altars bloody was their Throne  Thro' the vex'd Isle the sanguine edict spread  'Twas Heav'n demanded mountains of the dead  In the dark grove which Superstition trod  Priests hid their spoils yet commun'd with their God  And muttering rites within the fearful gloom  First stab a victim then the feast resume  Unfelt as yet the soft'ning ties of life  Deep in the prisoner's breast the ruthless knise  The desperate Female plung'dcould man do more  Then idly prophesied as flow'd the gore  A rage of slaughter then the Sex possest  Now with each grace of Love and Pity blest  But soon the savage Tyrant was the Slave  For fell Invaders pierc'd the Druid cave  Forth from the Baltic pour'd the deathful host  And train'd to havock crimson'd all the coast  The Northern Hive swarm'd terrible around  And every altar smoak'd upon the ground  Promiscuous carnage spotted every hand  Swell'd the gorg'd tomb and deluged all the land  Different in mind and manners as in face  The Normans came an innovating race  Their power their passions and their pride they brought  Fierce bold and bloody and with conquest fraught  From the forc'd mixture of a foreign breed  Unnatural customs laws and wars succeed  The  Saxon  superstition weak as dire  In two extremes of water and of fire  But these were lenient mercies to the strife  That  then  with horror hung a cloud on life  For then the ties of social Good unbound  Assassination took its deathful round  In every grove some lurking stabber lay  And human bloodshed clotted all the way  Frequent the mangled corpse obscene appear'd  And mutual hate the sanguine standard rear'd  In slavish homage to a haughty Lord  Each homefelt joy was broken at the board  From house to house the Tyrant's edict ran  And the Feast ended ere the Mirth began  At the eighth hour toll'd out by dread command  The dreary knell that darken'd all the land  Friendship no more her magic could impart  Nor share the glad nor raise the drooping heart  The "blazing faggot" chear'd the hearth no more  And all the soft'ning blooms of life were o'er  To ruin'd Juries the dire sword succeeds  And at each pore insulted Justice bleeds  The savage beasts which Nature gave to all  To glut the rage of scepter'd pride must fall  No more the chace no more the woods were free  All all was Hatefor all was SLAVERY  The LawyerClergy too and  Baron  proud  Aping their Prince struck terror thro' the croud  Next bigot  Priests  th' imposing mandate bring  And yoke the Neck of each succeeding King  Fair truth in fetters was with reason bound  And dread Anathemas were peal'd around  Pontiff Hypocrisy parade of prayer  Pardon or curse indalgence or despair  The heart was tainted and the head confus'd  And all the attributes of God abus'd  Kings Priests and People in one chaos hurl'd  And Virtue left with Liberty the World  Eventful BRITAIN should the Muse display  The bloody tracks which mark'd thy homeward way  Or trace the Deluges of Foreign Gore  That ran in purple torrents thro' thy shore  As conquest oft her crimson pinion spread  And different victors different horrors bred  Thy hardiest Sons would tremble but to view  The fearful picture that her pencil drew  Last and what greater proofs can now remain  Touch we the border of SURINAM's plain  Lo there the purchas'd NEGROES may'st thou see  Bursting their bonds indignant to be free  From rocks and caves in daring Bands they come  And wrought to blood like warring Lions roam  Fire Plague and Death th' untutor'd Bands defy  Resolv'd on Freedom or resolv'd to die  Then blest the  Penn  man and worthy to be blest  Friend of the Wretched Guardian of th' oppress'd  Blest be the Manye Negroes bow the knee  And bless him Thou Oh sweet HUMANITY  Who scorning interest thus pourtray'd the plan  That gave to Men the awful rights of Man  "Oh Race dishonour'd whose sad forms we tear  "Nor heed our kindred heed our Maker there  "Too long on sordid Altars have ye bled  "From Christian hearts too long has Mercy fled  "At length return'd behold she brings relief  "From Heav'n she comes to sooth the Captive's grief  "My brethren rise the galling chains unbind  "And give the generous Model to mankind  "What Avarice seiz'd let Justice now restore  "Let Negroes serve but serve as Slaves no more  "  Or if the  NAME  of Slave must yet remain  "  Strive not for words so we remove the pain    "  Strive not for words so we the rights supply  "  The ravish'd rights of sweet  HUMANITY"  The good Man spake applauding thousands bow'd  The Hero triumph'd and the Christian glow'd  Unnumber'd Hearts by great example fir'd  Bent to the Law HUMANITY requir'd  Unnumber'd Manacles that moment broke  Unnumber'd Slaves were loosen'd from the yoke  Unnumber'd Hands were folded up in air  Unnumber'd Voices breath'd a grateful prayer  Unnumber'd Eyes late bath'd in tears of woe  Ah blissful change with tears of joy o'erflow  From God the spark began to Man it came  Till all perceiving all partook the flame  Heav'n's fire electric as one touch'd the ball  It struck a second till it spread to all  And shall not generous England catch the flame  And add the Wreath of Mercy to her fame  Shall not HUMANITY assert her cause  And Albions Slave find  Justice in her Laws  Those equal Laws whose amicable sway  The rich and poor the high and low obey  Blest Land where  Sovereigns  view their roofs ascend  While LAW and LIBERTY their thrones defend  Blest  Subjects  too whose guarded mansions stand  Too firm for Tyranny's rapacious Hand  Where the poor  Peasant  knows his Cot secure  Humble in size but on foundations sure  Where boldly fenc'd his little Garden grows  And not a King DARES rob him of a Rose  Thus in the crouded Hive tho' all agree  To choose their Monarch the proud Swarms are free  Plebeian Cells as sacred as the Great  And both contribute honey to the State  Launch then the Bark unfurl th' impatient Sails  Swell ye kind Seas and blow ye fostering Gales  Oh haste some Angel thro' the realms of air  To Afric's Sons Britannia's tidings bear  Thrice happy he who first shall reach the strand  To spread the joys of Freedom thro' the Land  His the rich bliss to see "his fellows blest"  His the glad welcome of some Heavenly guest  And lo methinks on Fancy's wing convey'd  The MUSE already gains the palmy shade  Herself the messenger to Afric's plains  Ardent she flies to break the tyrantchains  Her voice already hails the list'ning croud  And thus she speaks her Embassy aloud  "I come I come to set the Captive free  "Ye suffering Heirs of sweet HUMANITY  "Whose Minds can reason and whose Hearts can move  "With all the joys and agonies of Love  "Sublime on Nature's scale again ye rise  Equals on Earth as equals in the skies  "Where Freedom bids now take your blithsome way  "Yours the fair morn and yours the closing day  "Yours is the jocund eve its sports command  "Or on the cooling wave or barren sand  "If in your breasts the Patriot passions burn  "To your lov'd Country to your Homes return  "Free unconsin'd where'er your course ye bend  "Still still shall LIBERTY your steps attend  "Negroes are Men and Men are Slaves no more  "Fair Freedom reigns and Tyranny is o'er"  And now they trace each scene of former love  Explore each favour'd haunt hill vale and grove  And soon the wellremember'd huts they find  Where faithful Friends and Loves were left behind  Sudden before her sable lord appears  Th' enfranchis'd wife adorn'd with faithful tears  Mothers again their kidnapp'd babes behold  Sons clasp their Sires in slavery grown old  Here their own Niger rises to the sight  And there their Nile's prolific banks invite  Far as extend these parent floods they range  Feel all at large and triumph in the change  And still in fond delight their triumphs rise  And this glad Truth reechoes to the skies  NEGROES ARE MEN AND MEN ARE SLAVES NO MORE  FAIR FREEDOM REIGNS AND TYRANNY IS O'ER  In the first Quarto Edition of this Work published in the Poem contained several more pages but as these sketch'd the Author's design and might indeed be considered as a poetical prospectus of the intended poem of SOCIETY the materials of which are lost and with them the probability of the Author's having leisure courage or life to begin his labour again with any wellfounded hope of reaching the point of which he once cherish'd the ambitionfor what cannot Youth and Poesy make us believe he has judg'd it better to end the present performance here only observing that in this revision of it he has avail'd himself of every criticism which on reflexion he  felt to be just  whether such criticism was public or private expressed with mildness or with rigour  DIALOGUE LETTERS CONTAINING  NECESSARY FIRST QUESTIONS AND ENQUIRIES  IN ENGLISH GERMAN AND DUTCH AS PROMISED BY THE GLEANER  TO THE READER  AS well to perform a promise as from a thorough conviction of their GREAT UTILITY to travellers of all descriptions these Letters are added but as there is nothing in them which can be either profitable or amusing  on this side  of the Continent and as  the ether side  is alas still forbidden ground without offering fruits or flowers or gleanings of any kind for the head or heart the Gleaner can neither expect or wish his Readers to lose the  present  time in such barren occupation but when longwish'd for and longwanted Peace shall  renew  the Earth and  revive  wounded Humanity he would as a Friend advise all those who carry their gratulations on that joyful event abroad to take these Dialogues along with them even though they should refuse the other parts of the work that honour not but that he would feel himself proud to be their Fellow Traveller in a literary sense  altogether  And  As it is  impossible  to write down the words exactly as they would sound when pronounced to an English ear the following observations may be of use A in the German
