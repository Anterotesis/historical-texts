 THE DISSENTERS ANSWER TO THE  HighChurch  Challenge  London  Printed in the Year  THE Dissenters Answer TO THE HighChurch Challenge  AS it is the Character of the Devil to bring a Railing Accusation so no Man of Sence or Manners cares to imitate him all Men of Learning that ever I met with will allow that People may Differ Debate and Dispute without  Billingsgate  Language that Invidious Names and Indecent Reproaches serve to gratifie the Spleen and flow from a Redundancy of Gall in the Author but add no manner of Force to his Argument good Words are as strenuous as bad and the Satyr lyes in the Truth not the ill Language of the Book  From this Principle the Author of a late Pamphlet with a Title as long as a Book and call'd  The Wolf Stript  must not expect a Return of Dirt for Dirt and while he calls every Man by his Name and yet is asham'd of  his own calls most Men out of their Names and fills his Book with the Exuberance of his Hypochondriack Vapours he ought to be look'd upon as an Author not worth while to meddle with if a Gentleman should fight with a Chimneysweeper he may beat the Man but he will daub himself so much will stink of the Soot and foul his Cloaths that the Victory is not worth the Disorder 'twill put him into  In like manner he that will deal with this Author in his own Way must foul his Mouth with so much BearGarden Language such rude unmannerly and unscholarlike Behaviour that he must be tainted with the ungrateful Savour of his Enemy's Malignancy and look like the Man he meddles with as not worth any Man's while  Upon this Account I shall not meddle with his Voluminous Tract it self but as he has made a fair Challenge in the Eighth Page of his Book to all the Dissenters I am willing to enter a little in the Case not so much expecting to silence a Tongue pointed with Raillery but to let the World know that the Dissenters are not unprovided with strong Arguments to defend a just Cause  The Challenge that this Gentleman has made to the World and of which he seems so very confident is as follows  The  Dissenters  make a Heavy  Noise  That the  Church  will not Purchase a  Reconciliation  with the giving up only of a few  Indifferent  Things which Offend their Tender  Consciences  And the  LowChurch  lay the Blame upon the  HighChurch  with very severe  Reflections  That they are  Obstructers  of this Blessed  Union  Now let none of these be  Judges  in their own  Cause  Therefore let the  Dissenters  give in to the Present  Convocation  a  List  of such  Indifferent  Things which if  Granted  they will  Promise  to  Conform  and Heal the  Schism  The  Scruples  are  Theirs  Therefore they must make the  Proposal  None others can tell what will  Satisfie  them  If they will not do this Let them stop their  Clamours  and Never more say That nothing will be  Granted  them And that the  Church  of  England  has no mind to Heal the  Schism  But if they will do this then it will appear Whether the  High  or the  LowChurch  will go Farthest to Purchase this Desir'd  Reconciliation  and which of them do in good Earnest Wish it and not rather to keep open the  Breach  to serve other  Designs  Next let those of the  Convocation  who were formerly Imploy'd in this Grand  Project  of  Reconciliation  of which they have made such Boasts lay before the  House  the Grounds and the Terms of it that it may appear they were none but  Indifferent  Things which were to be Given up to the  Dissenters  Otherwise let Them too  Cease  their  Railing  at the  HighChurch  as Men of Violent Spirits  c  for  Obstructing  their  Designs  Or for  Suspecting  whatthey were  The  HighChurch  Desire That they and the  LowChurch  and the  Dissenters  too may be  Try'd  by their  Actions  and not by the  Clamours  on either Side And that they may be Heard  Publickly  in the Face of the World by the  Method  Propos'd  And Whoever  Refuse  this and cannot Propose a more  Rational  and  Convincing  Way for the  Clearing  of  Themselves  let  Them  be  Guilty  Had this been a new Challenge this Author might have had some Reason to have expected it should have been accepted and replied to  But since I find his Reading as short as his Censure is hasty I think the properest Method is to revise what of this Kind has been already done and to put him in Mind that all he has said only ends in this Absurdity of arguing  viz  The Dissenters have already been challeng'd to this have accepted the Challenge undertaken the Defence of their Doctrine and of their Dissenting have effectually vindicated themselves from the Charge of Schism given Reasons for their Scruples and made Proposals for Conformity they have challeng'd the Church to Union and Peace they have defended themselves  from the Charge of Disloyalty and Rebellion and offered the Church to bring their Loyalty to the Test with them and none of these things have ever been Answer'd or some of them not so much as Reply'd to  Now as this Gentleman supplies Matter of Fact with Indecency and Railery I shall not need to follow him there he begins the very first Page of his Book with Three positive Falsities neither of which he can in the least tollerable manner make out  First That they have a Society of Writers  Secondly That the Dissenters find themselves worsted in Argument  In the same Page he tells us  Tis the Method of the Dissenters not to mind any Answer but to repeat and repeat their own Objections  IN INFINITUM  'Tis far from my Design to Reply to a Book as full of Absurdities and Contradictions as it is Verbose and Malignant and therefore I shall content my self with these Three Instances  As to the Dissenters having a Society of Writers I am so well satisfied of its being a Forgery of his own that I Challenge him to  make appear that there is so much as a Correspondence among them of any Two together that have ever Wrote in the Behalf of the Dissenters and as he is mighty forward to print Names and to abuse them by Name too he is welcome to set down their Names if he can In which if he pursue his usual Method of presuming things are so and then affirming it as positively as if he cou'd prove it he will certainly Ensnare and Expose himself as much in the Particulars as he has done now in the General  Had the Dissenters so much Unanimity among themselves as he pretends they have they would have too great a share in the Publick Regard to let such a hardmouth'd Author Treat them in so Scurrilous a Manner as he does the Government would suppress the Spirit of Railery in the Mouths of these Enflamers that they should not have such a full Liberty of Traducing and Abusing their Bretheren in order to keep open the Breach which 'tis every True  English  Protestant's Desire and Interest to see heal'd  No Sir the Dissenters have no such Societies the Spirit of Union  the more Ʋnhappy for them  is not so much among them they are all forward enough to have any Body serve them but it must be at their own Hazard and at their own Expence which a  late unhappy Author of theirs very lately had Experience of enough to warn any Man from venturing to serve them again  But therefore Sir is it plain that this Book is far from being Wrote as a Design of the Party but with the Sence of Truth which every Honest Man has a Right to Vindicate  At the same time Sir I affirm your Party has and ever had a Society of Writers and whenever you desire it I am ready to gratifie you with some of their Names tho' I am not forward of printing Names as a piece of Rudeness unbecoming an Author But a certain Weekly Paper now in Course is Publickly own'd to be so wrote and I know Personally that the wretched Performance has occasion'd some Considerations among People of greater Capacities to provide a Set of Men to do it better and to gratifie them for the Service  But Sir I shall not enter upon the tedious Work of Recrimination as a thing in which there is so much room for launching out that the compass of this small Tract would be too straight for it  You tell us  The Faction  which is your Civil Term for the Dissenters  find themselves worsted in Argument  It had been time enough to have boasted thus when you had put your Armour off and  when the many Tracts wrote by the Dissenters in their own just Vindication have been Answer'd  But this Gentleman has the Misfortune so to be blinded by his Passion as to cry  Victoria  before the Battle is ended and not to trouble you Sir with many Negatives I wish you would let us see  one Time  whenever by any thing but Railery you  worsted  the Dissenters  We confess Sir that at ill Language you have the better of us whether you have any Professors of the Scolding Talent among your Students we know not for you will not suffer us to be Taught in your Universities but we assure you that in those Schools where we are fain to bring up our Youth we Teach no such Science  But as if all you had laid down on that Head were true and you were very certain that you had worsted the Dissenters in Argument you give them a home Charge  That  'tis their Method not to mind Answers but to Repeat and Repeat their own Objections  In Infinitum  Now Sir This may or may not be true according as you can or cannot give a Genuine Answer to the following Account of Answers given and Books written by Dissenters in their own Vindication which you  nor any of your Church have ever yet thought fit to venture an Answer to and  when you can  you may defend your Church from unfair Treatment of the Dissenters in point of Argument on this Head  And not to go too far beyond the Memory of those we are talking to I think there stands Two Books of the Learned Mr  Clarkson  yet unanswered the one Entituled  No Scripture Evidence for Diocesian Bishops  and the other  A Discourse of Liturgies  'Tis true there is a long and learned Discourse of Dr  Comber  's then  Precentor  of  York  wherein with some of our Author's Spirit Treating the Memory of Mr  Clarkson  neither like a Gentleman nor a Scholar tho' all Men know he was as much of both as ever the Nation bred and tho' a Dissenter had the Honour to be Tutor to the Learned and most Excellent Dr  Tillotson  late Archbishop of  Canterbury  After this Author has pleased himself with sufficiently reproaching his Deceased Antagonist he goes on to rummage Antiquity to prove that Liturgies were in use in the Primitive Church This was no part of the Dispute and had not the Doctor overlook'd it in his haste Mr  Clarkson  had Anticipated his whole Discourse in  p    'Whether Liturgies or Forms of Worship and Administration  were in use in the Primitive Church or not is no part of the present Dispute'  'But whether these Liturgies were prescrib'd and Impos'd as Terms of Communion this is the Question'  Now to this Question the Dr is not pleas'd to say one Word as I can observe in his whole Book but goes on to prove that to be true which Mr  Clarkson  granted and lets that alone which he deny'd  Nay so Ridiculous was this Answerer in the Management of himself both in the Search of Antiquity and in rendring those Authors he Quotes that a Learned Minister of the Church of  England  meerly with a respect to Justice and Learning Reply'd to him and made it appear that the Doctor did not so much as understand the Language of the Quotations This was Mr  Samuel Bold  Rector of  Steeples  in  Dorsetshire  This I suppose is some Peoples Way of Answering the Dissenters and if this may pass for Answering they are Answer'd indeed But I must take the Freedom to say It has yet remain'd unprov'd that ever a strict Literal Compliance to any Prescrib'd Form of Worship and Administration of Sacraments was Impos'd as the Term or Condition of Communion in any Branch of the Christian Church for above Years after our Saviour's  time nay 'twould be hard to prove it ever done in any Church in the World but ours to this Day and they are still welcome to make it out if they can and till they do the World may judge whether the Dissenters are  worsted in Argument  or no  That there were Bishops in the Primitive Church has also been defended with a great deal of Skill but as to their Diocesan Royalty and Juridiction they have always in Prudence thought fit to let the Dispute of it alone and I would advise them to do so still for they must find some other Book to defend it from than the Scripture and some other Ages of the World to search for the Practice in than that of the Primitive Church  But I must confess the Dissenters were worsted another Way in the Case of Dr  Calamy  and Mr  Delaun  of which remarkable Story this is the short Abstract  Dr  Calamy  preaching a Sermon at  Aldermanbury  Church Entituled  A Discourse about Scrupulous Consciences  makes the Dissenters this fair Challenge as by his printed Sermon  P    appears in these Words  Could we but prevail with the People diligently to examine the Merits of the Cause our Church would every Day gain Ground amongst all wise Men for we care not how much Knowledge and Ʋnderstanding our People have so they be but Humble and Modest with it Nor do we desire  Men to become our Proselites any farther than we give them Scripture for it  And in another Place he goes on  All we desire of the Dissenters is that they would equally hear both Sides that they would weigh and consider the Arguments that may be propounded to them and being indifferent to either Part of the Question would think it no Shame to change their Mind when they see good Reason for it  Mr  Delaun  a Man whose Learning and Temper were Conspicuous to all the Learned World and particularly in the Book he wrote accepts this Challenge and writes down his Reasons for Nonconformity and as the Doctor had printed his Sermon and thereby appeal'd to the World all Peoples Mouths were fill'd with the Fairness of the Proposal and every Body cry'd out the Dissenters were worsted Mr  Delaun  therefore thought himself oblig'd to print his Reply  But as the Victory consisted as it does still in Boasts and Rhodomontades so they were as loth to be overcome as sensible that they should be so and took immediate Care to suppress the Book by seizing the Copy at the Printer's and this was follow'd by seizing the Author for writing a Seditious Libel put him in Prison fin'd him  Ʋltra Tenementum  and were hardly prevail'd upon to vouchsafe him the Favour to excuse him the Pillory which  they at last told him in Court was only remitted in respect to his Learning  Here was a true ChurchConquest and this Gentleman was persecuted with so much true Church Zeal that he lay in  Newgate  for his Fine till he his Wife and Children died there to the Eternal Scandal both of the Churchman and the Dissenters the one that he should first challenge a Dispute and then so basely Treat the Man that accepted it and the other that they should not contribute  l  to save a Life sacrific'd for their Defence and such a Life as for real Merit deserv'd infinitely more Regard in a Nation of Humanity and Religion as we fancy our selves to be  The Book for which this Gentleman was thus handl'd remains to this Day unanswer'd by these People that boast so much of  worsting the Dissenters  and they would do well to look back upon that Book and make some rational Reply to it before they tell us we can shew no Reasons for our Dissenting  In like manner they proceed still with the Dissenters upon other Points of arguing as particularly by  Repealing and Repeating In Infinitum  the Charge of Rebellion and Faction whereas they have been over and over Challeng'd make out their own Loyalty of Principles or Practice to exceed the Loyalty of the Dissenters  And  De Foe  's  Test of the Church of  England's  Loyalty  has receiv'd yet no other Answer than his  Shortest Way  by a Fine  Ʋltra Tenement  m  and the reproachful Answer of  the Pillory  If this be your Way of answering Arguments Gentlemen 'tis no wonder you can worst the Dissenters  To proceed in their usual Method a worthy Member of the House of Commons has publish'd a Book to vindicate the Occasional Bill and like those who take Things upon Trust has affirm'd that all wise Nations in the World have thought it necessary to entrust the Administration of Publick Affairs in the Hands of such Persons only as are of one and the same Persuasion in Matters of Religion  A very handsome Way of calling all the Christian World Fools For I defie him to shew me one of those wise Nations and to prove it by one Instance unless where there has not been any Toleration of other Persuasions the Turks only Excepted  Thus Gentlemen we are worsted by Forgeries and Falsities not by Arguments we are challeng'd to Dispute and then ruin'd for Disputing ask'd Questions and then fetch'd up for Answering them But since this Gentleman has found an Adversary capable to deal with him  Power and Pts excepted  I leave  him to say the Dissenters are worsted when he proves it by a sufficient Reply  We are now challeng'd to prove that we dissent from the Church in Points so far from being essential as that the Chnrch cannot be justified in Refusing to abate them and we are desir'd to give in the Objections to the Convocation  What Authority their Author has from the Convocation to make this Offer I know not and do not see how I shall know it or whether the Convocation will receive such a List of the indifferent things or no but since this bold Challenger would be answered and will not be satisfied with a General Reply but this must be spoken to by it self I crave leave to accept his Challenge as far as the following Particulars reach  First I do affirm this has been done already by the whole Body of the Dissenting Ministers in such a Manner and with such modest Reasons as several of the Episcopal Clergy were so satisfied with and did so represent to King  Charles  the Second that their Concessions were a sufficient Ground of a Union VVhat and who hindred a Union when the Dissenters made such Concessions I leave to this Gentleman to tell us if he cares to expose his Friends so much  Secondly I do affirm that if the Church of  England  would think fit so far to stoop to their Dissenting Brethren as to abate  such things only  and  all such  as are acknowledg'd by themselves to be Indifferent if it would not reduce us all to such a perfect Union as to Comprehend all Parties it would yet Embrace so many in the Arms of the Church 'Twould cause so many to return to the Church among the Dissenters as would render the Remainder less considerable  I am to suppose the Challenger in this Matter does not expect I should give in such a List of Alterations as would Reconcile the Quakers or perhaps not all other Societies or to tell him what Sorts would Conform and what would not But I answer him in Reason if I say for my self that upon such Concessions I would Conform with all my Heart and Thousands more I believe would do the like  Since then he has made such an Offer let us Examine what it is we desire of the Church what are the Indifferent Things we differ about and  I join Issue with him  if the Convocation thinks fit to make these Abatements and Amendments and we refuse to Conform then I am content we shall pass  for a People who are willing to keep open the Breach to serve other Designs  Before I descend to the Particulars 'tis necessary to make some Enquiry into what I call Indifferent  I call those Things Indifferent which are not Essential Points of Doctrine without the Belief or Practice whereof a Man cannot obtain Salvation  All things introduc'd into the Church of  England  either in Worship or in Discipline by Humane Institution which are not to be found either by Command or by President in the Holy Scriptures  which are the Rule of our Faith  On this Head of Indifferent Things therefore I join Issue with our Author and if he thinks fit to present our Humble Address to the Convocation that they will be pleas'd to make such Abatement in the Indifferent Things following I am persuaded such Multitudes of Dissenters will come into the Church as may very well deserve the Name of a Union tho' not of an Universal Conformity and the Number of Remaining Discenters would be much the smaller  First of all as to Liturgies we desire since it is all Originally Humane and made by Men Fallible and of like Passions with our selves they may suffer such Amendment as are Reasonable and Justifiable from Scripture and the Practice of the Primitive Church  Secondly We desire that after such Amendment the Minister may not in all Cases be Ti'd up and Prescrib'd by the Letter of the Book but may have Liberty to Express himself at large in Prayer as the present Exigence of the Case may require and his own Abilities may supply  Thirdly We desire the Ordination of Ministers by Presbyters may be allow'd being Justifiable by Scripture and that our Ministers may be admitted into Holy Orders without the Reordination and Imposing of Unreasonable Oaths  Fourthly We desire the Kneeling at the Sacrament Bowing at the Name of Jesus the Cross in Baptism the Use of the Surplice and all those Things own'd by the Greatest Masters of the Dispute to be Indifferent may either be wholly left out or so left at the Discretion of the People as that they may not be impos'd upon them without their Consent  Fifthly We desire the Episcopal Hierarchy to be Reduc'd to such a Pitch of Authority as may be justified by the Scripture and to no other and we are ready to enter into an Examination with them what that Particular of Power amounts to and how far it extends  I do not say these are all the Heads which I suppose the Dissenters require but I say these are some of them and the most Considerable and if the Church would give such Concessions as were Reasonable on these Heads the Controversie would soon be decided Whether the Dissenters Separated from the Established Church on frivolous Grounds or no  First As to Alterations in the Liturgy 'tis the Avow'd Opinion of the Church of  England  that no Church in the World is infallible and above all our Church does not pretend to the Title If then we are not Infallible but subject to Err and Mistake why should she refuse to Enter into the Cause whether it is convenient to make any farther or more perfect Reformation or no but tho' the Consideration were not on a farther Reformation yet if it were only giving up some  smaller Matter for the sake of Christian Peace it were not Commendable only but a Due Requisite Temper in a Christian Church  As to them that blame the Dissenters for Separating let us enquire of them  if they are uncapable of greater Light  and consequently of knowing better what they ought to do than they did before If then they will suppress this Light and refuse to Amend Things tho' the Light of their own Conscience directs them to it where lyes the Charge of Schism Surely not at their Door who would only pursue a perfect Reformation and think it their Duty to serve God in the VVay most agreeable to his Revealed VVill in the Scriptures but at theirs who would oblige them to worship him according to the Inventions of Men by Forms and Methods for which they have neither Warrant Command of Example either in the Scripture or the Primitive Practice of the Church I Appeal to all the World that as well now as before it is not our Faults that they bring the Liturgy upon the Stage of Dispute but the bold Challengers of Men that can never make good their Arguments And they ought first to have Answered what has been said already before they had Challeng'd us to show New Reasons  Wherefore in the Sense first of the Irresistable Force of what has been said already and secondly of my Incapacity of saying more to the Purpose at least in so short a time I make the Proposers this fair Offer and they are at Liberty to carry it to the Convocation for 'tis their Business not ours  When they will please to Answer Mr  De Laun  's  Plea for the Nonconformists  and the Substantial yet Unanswerable Reasons there given for our Dissenting  When they will please to Reply to the Concessions of the Dissenters in the Conference at the  Savoy  and prove they were not sufficient Grounds of an Union  When they will Confute the Scriptural Authority of Bishop  Ʋsher  's  Model of ChurchGovernment  which was much the same with the Scheme the Dissenters presented to King  Charles  the Second and give the Reasons why the Bishops refused it  Baxt Life  cap  If they please to Reply  a little more to the Purpose  than Mr  Osfley  and Mr  Hoadly has done  to the Grounds and Reasons of Nonconformity in the th Chapter of  Baxter  's  Life Abridg'd  by Mr  Calamy  and to some yet Unanswered Things in Mr  Calamy  's  Reply  to Mr  Hoadly  If they please to give a Rational Answer to the first Second and Third Vol of the  Conformists Plea for the Nonconformists  wrote by a Member of their own Church and to  Gillespy  's  View of English Popish Ceremonies  Whenever these things are Soberly and Judiciously Answered and as Dr  Calamy  proposed good Scripture and Reason brought for it assure your self Sir when these Things are Answered there shall be no manner of need to bring an Occasional Bill to prevent the Alternate Conformity of Dissenters 'tis most certain that the far greater Number of them will come in and become your Christian United Brethren and till you do these Things Gentlemen we Appeal to all the World who are the Causers of the Schism you speak of those that all along offered to come in upon Reasonable Conditions or those that have persecuted us for not complying with Humane Institutions which are no where to be found in Scripture  which is the only Rule of Faith  And thus now the World may see with what Truth these Gentlemen blacken the Dissenters  with their Repeating Objections but taking no notice of Answers  which I here fairly return upon them and assure them that whenever  they will Answer the Objections in Mr  De Laun  's Book against the Liturgy and Canon of the Church of  England  and prove the same to be necessary from Scripture and Reason I will certainly Conform for I believe and own it my Duty to Conform to them if I can and I can never resist Conforming to any thing which is prov'd to be my Duty from Reason and Scripture  I think 'tis needless to say much of my own after such Men as these have appear'd and gone off the Stage with no Reply neither can I satisfie my self to attempt any thing by way of Addition to Men of such exalted Learning till I can see something New offered upon these Heads and unless these Gentlemen have something to say more than has been said before them by Men superior in Learning to themselves What they now advance savours of an Arrogance peculiar to themselves and which I like so ill that I care not to imitate  I shall therefore think it more than sufficient thus to tell them what has been said already and if they have any thing to say by way of Reply that demands an Answer they may not want what is needful to justifie the Practice and Principles of the Dissenters to be such as neither the Charge of Faction or Rebellion can be laid at their Doors and it  seems by this Challenge he would let the World believe that the Church of  England  would not stand with the Dissenters for small Matters and I cannot but wonder with what Face he can Publish to the World these following Words which I am persuaded he has no Authority for from his Superiors  We should have little Quarrel with the Dissenters about all the Objections they make as to Habits Ceremonies Liturgy and even the Grand Point of Ordination by Presbyters in Cases of Necessity if it were not for that Fulsome Word Schism if they did not gather Separate Congregations and set them up in Opposition to the Church and so form a Schism they would be no Dissenters notwithstanding their different Sentiments as to the Points before mentioned  All these are his own Words P    Thou Hypocrite out of thine own Mouth shalt thou be condemned  If you had not Quarrell'd with us about Habits Ceremonies Liturgy and Ordination there had been no Schism no Separate Congregations gathered no breaking off from the Church no such thing as Dissenters at least but few among us and to impose this upon the World after such plain Evidence as has been given to the contrary deserves a courser Title than I care to foul my Paper with and evidently shows the Method of the Party who run down the Dissenters by Falsities and Forgeries  And that I may do what these People seldom concern themselves about I lay it down as a Truth that when King  Charles  the Second was Restor'd to the Crown the present Dissenters being then desir'd to Conform to the Church of  England  and their Ministers having very good Inducement so to do  viz  the Possession of their Livings and Benefices they were Commanded by the King to give in their Proposals upon which they would Conform  And 'tis needful to give a short Abstract of the Proceedings in that Case in Order to let the World see what occasion'd the Schism these People cry so much out of and to place the Guilt of it where it really lyes for as the Morality so the Immorality of every Action consists in the Principle from whence it proceeds and the End to which it is design'd  At the Restoration of King  Charles  II to put the Dissenters in Hopes that a Reconciliation was intended Ten or Twelve of the Principal of them were made His Majesties Chaplains and these designing to improve that Opportunity waited upon him introduc'd by the Earl of  Manchester  and humbly recommended to His Majesty the Happiness and the Opportunity of a Union among his Protestant Subjects in Matters of Religion  and begging of him that  ONLY NECESSARY THINGS might be the Terms of Ʋnion  The King declar'd himself very favourably on this Head profess'd that the Proposal was exceeding agreeable to him and promis'd them to do his utmost to bring it to pass Telling them withal  That this Agreement cou'd not be expected but by abating something on both Sides and meeting one another in the Midway and that if they were willing to do their Parts if it was not effected it should be their own Faults and not his  Here it may very well be observ'd that the Schism lyes directly at the Door of the Church  if the King's Words are true  For the Dissenters did make Offers of meeting half Way and more than half Way as shall presently be made out and if our Brethren of the Church can make out one Step offer'd by them in the most indifferent Circumstance then ours is the Schism and not theirs If not  Vae vobis Hypocritae  Job  Thine own Mouth condemneth thee and not I yea thine own Lips testifie against thee  The King after this directed  That they should bring in Proposals of the utmost they could yield to  and they in return besought His Majesty That  at the same time that they offer'd their Concession to His Majesty the Brethren on the other side might also bring in theirs containing the utmost they would abate and yield to in order to Concord  and the King  promis'd them it should be so  Cal Ab  Baxter's  Life  p  According to this Direction of the King they met and agreed upon a Paper with a most Humble Address to His Majesty they make Four Preliminary Requests to the King and then offer'd their Proposals an Abstract of which you have in Mr  Calamy  's  Abridgment  aforesaid  p  and for the Faithfulness of the Quotation the Reader is referr'd to the Original which is to be seen in Print  First They request  That serious Godliness might be countenanced a Learned and Pious Minister in each Parish encouraged that a Personal Publick owning the Baptismal Covenant might precede an Admission to the Lord's Table and that the Lord's Day might be strictly sanctified  They offer to allow of the true ancient Primitive Precedency in the Church with a due Mixture of Presbyters in order to the avoiding the Corruptions Partiality Tyranny and other Evils which are incident to the Administration of a single Person the Things which they principally blamed in the  English Frame  were the  great Extent of the Bishops Diocess Their deputing Commissaries Chancellors and Officials to act in their Stead Their assuming their sole Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction and acting so arbitrarily in Visitation Articles  bringing in new Ceremonies and suspending Ministers at Pleasure And for reforming  these Evils they proposed that  Bishop  Usher's  Reduction of Episcopacy unto the Form of Synodical Government received in the ancient Church  should be the Groundwork of an Accommodation and that Suffragans should be chosen by the respective Synods The Associations be of a moderate Extent the Ministers to be under no Oaths or Promises of Obedience to the Bishops as being responsible for any Transgression of the Law and that the Bishops govern not by Will and Pleasure but according to Rules Canons and Constitutions that should be ratified and establish'd by Act of Parliament As to the  Liturgy  they owned the Lawfulness of a prescribed Form of Publick Worship but desired that some Learned and Pious and Moderate Divines of both sorts might be employed either to compile a new  Liturgy  or to reform the old adding some other varying Forms in Scripture Phrase to be used at the Minister's Choice As to the  Ceremonies  they humbly represented that the Worship of God was perfect without them that God hath declared himself in Matters of Worship a jealous God that the Reformed Churches abroad most of them rejected the Ceremonies that were reclaimed here that here in  England  they had ever since the Reformation been Matters of Contention and Dispute that they had occasioned the silencing  of many Pious and Useful Ministers and given Rise to many Separations from the Church That they were at best but indifferent and in there own Nature mutable and therefore they begg'd that kneeling at the Sacrament might not be imposed and that the Surplice and the Cross in Baptism and the bowing at the Name of  Jesus  rather than  Christ  or  Emanuel  might be abolished and that Care might be taken to prevent future Innovations contrary to Law that so the Publick Worship might be free not only from Blame but Suspicion  Does this look like a Proposal from Men that did not dissent but upon Factious and Politick Principles 'Tis hard there shou'd be any Occasion to revive the Discourse of these Things at a Time when we wish for that  Peace and Ʋnion  which Her Majesty has so earnestly invited us to But these Men of Storms and Heat who are wilfully ignorant themselves are willing other Men should be blindly so and therefore 'tis necessary a little to refresh their Memory and to shew to the World that this Schism and Separation of the Dissenters was wholly occasion'd by the Church refusing to give up indifferent Things and imposing those indifferent Things as Terms of Communion upon the Consciences of all the People  The King upon the Ministers delivering in the Proposals and Address  Treated them very respectfully  says the same Author  renew'd his Professions of his earnest Desires of an Accommodation of the Differences told them he was well pleas'd that they agreed to a Liturgy and yielded to the Essence of Episcopacy  Here is an Acknowledgment from the Head of the Church that the Dissenters were for an Accommodation agreed to a Liturgy and to the Essence of Episcopacy and yet our Modern Men of Peace will throw all the Breach upon the Dissenters  Now Gentlemen let us examine your Christian HighChurch Temper these yielding complying Dissenters met with that we may see whether they were out or were driven out from the Church  The Dissenters that were to be  for Yet they were not so  expected according to their Request and His Majesty's Promise to be met with by the Divines on the other Side and to see their Proposals but none appear'd and after long expecting their Condescentions and Compliances at last they receiv'd a Satyrical Answer by way of Reflection to their Proposals but not one Word of Condescention and Compliance  'As to  ChurchCovernment  they declare for the former Hierarchy without any Alteration and inviduously insinuate that their Reflections on the Consequences of a single Person's Administration in the Church was as applicable to the Civil State The  Extent of Diocesses  they declare suitable enough to the Bishops Office and the  Administration of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction by Chancellors  c Regular in the Main Bishop  Ʋsher  's  Reduction  they reject as inconsistent with Two other of his Discourses as being at best but a heap of Private Conceptions The  Liturgy  they applaud as unexceptionable and think it can't be said to be too Rigorously imposed when Ministers are not denied the Exercise of their Gifts in Praying before and after Sermon which Sort of Praying they declare however is but the continuance of a Custom of no great Authority and grown into Common use by Sufferance only without any other Foundation in the Laws and Canons The Revising the  Liturgy  nevertheless they yield to if his Majesty thinks fit As for the  Ceremonies  they could not part with one not being able to think that the Satisfaction of some Private Persons was to be laid in Ballance against the Publick Peace and Uniformity of the Church Nay were any Abatements made they are satisfied unquiet Spirits would be  thereby encouraged to make further Demands'  Ecce signum  here's the Foundation of the Dissenters Schism in Three Heads  Episcopal Hierarchy without Alteration  Liturgy Ʋnexceptionable and impossible to be too Rigorously Impos'd  Ceremonies not one to be parted with  Pray Gentlemen how long have ye alter'd your Minds that you can now say  you won't quarrel with us for Habits Ceremonies or Ordination  and when we offer'd to agree with you in every thing else you would have  your Ordination without Alteration  you would not part with  one of the Ceremonies  and thought  your Liturgy Ʋnexceptionable and that it cou'd not be too Rigorously Imposed  How long is it since these Gentlemen have been of a better Opinion And when all is done how shall we be sure their Proposal is Genuine while we have experienc'd so much Falsity and illgrounded Passion as before  Here now is the Picture of a HighChurch Challenge to which we may very well Answer we are the same that we were when we made the Proposals to King  Charles  the Second and we have a great deal of Reason to believe you are the same too  Ill Nature seldom turns Changling  'Tis true you did promise us  fine things you promised to come to a Temper with the Dissenters and declar'd 'twas your Principle to give an Ease to Consciences truly Scrupulous and upon this Foot you obtain'd upon us to join with you in the Revolution Now you talk of Honesty pray Gentlemen do us the Favour to let us know in what you ever perform'd that Promise and when we are to expect it  Now you shall be put to Trial of your Honesty and Justice what Commission you had from the Convocation to tell us you would not Differ about  Habits Ceremonies Liturgy  and  Ordination  I know not and believe you will be puzzled to produce it But I venture to say to you from abundance of the Dissenters  that then you shall differ with us for nothing  Remit us these and we will Conform to you and be all One Church and One People  'Tis about these Things Chiefly you Differ with us you have no Pretences but these upon us The Articles of Rebellion Forty One the  RyeHouse  Plot  Castares  's Evidences and more We can allow you all these and many more than is true and yet prove that your Principles are as Disloyal and your Practices have been as full of Rebellion as ours you have made as many Insurrections against the Establish'd Governors of the Nation as we you have made as many Factions  against the Princes and the Laws took up Arms as often kill'd as many Kings or endeavour'd it as we and how often have you been Challeng'd to come to a Test of your Loyalty with us But you are Proof against Argument and without taking notice of these things or of any thing else that stands against you you  Repeat and Repeat  your Railings and suffer your Tongues to Launch out in a sensless and insignificant manner  In Insinitum  And to help load the Dissenters with Infamy you Charge them with all that has been done in  Scotland  where the Arbitrary Tyranny of State Ministers oftentimes made the People Desperate No wonder if from such Principles you can Charge them with Burning the City of  London  One would think these Gentlemens Passions should not make them forget their Reason so much as to expose their Proceedings to their own Friends  Did not the Committee of Parliament fix the Firing of the City upon the  Roman Catholicks  by the irresistable Testimony of the Persons concern'd and why must the Dissenters do it Had you brought them by Persecution to such desperate Fortunes to such Despair as to set Fire to their own Houses Were there not almost as many of them Burnt out as of the Church  The ridiculous Fury of these Men is an Answer to themselves and upon the whole I offer to make out That the Dissenters have on all Occasions behav'd themselves with as much Zeal for the Government as much Sincerity to the Soveraign and as much Loyalty as the Church has done let them begin the Debate when they please  On the other Hand I'll prove That the High Church Party has tyranniz'd over them by all the Illegal Unchristian Methods possible endeavouring to drive them to the Extremities of Despair and Rebellion  I'll prove by the Preachings Printings and declar'd Judgment of several of the most zealous High Party that however the Practice was disown'd by the Party upon the unseasonable exposing it by the Book call'd  The Shortest Way  yet that it has all along been their Desire and very often in their Design and I appeal for the Truth of it among many Instances to a Letter of a known Churchman whose Original I have by me being wrote to a Person who sent him the Book for a Present  SIR  I Received yours and enclosed the Book call'd  The Shortest Way with the Dissenters  for which I thank you and next to the Holy Bible and  Sacred Comments I place it as the most Valuable Thing I can have I look upon it as the only Method and I pray God to put it into the Heart of our most Gracious Queen to put what is there propos'd in Execution  Here is the Character of a HighChurchman drawn to the Life but when in a Post or Two this Gentleman understood it was wrote by a Dissenter in his next he sends up an Invidious Character of a Whig and what in his Opinion such a one deserv'd  And now Gentlemen would Reason and Arguments serve for a Reply to you I should go on with your voluminous Rapsody of Scandal but really it is so full of Rudeness and Want of Manners as well as Want of Truth that I chuse to let it go and return to your Challenge about our Conformity and this you direct us to lay before the Convocation which I cannot but make some just Exceptions to  I see no Reason to believe the Convocation has given you any Authority to make the Proposal I cannot but believe that the Convocation knows too well what and how often the Dissenters have offer'd the very Thing these Gentlemen propose the Convocation cannot be ignorant that all Proposals of Amendment and Abatement are Ungrateful and Disagreeable to the Temper of these  HighChurchmen and the Convocation could not be guilty of so much Imprudence to offer that to us now which we have so often offered them to no Purpose  I see no Reason to believe the Convocation will perform the Conditions these Gentlemen propose  viz  to abate the Habits Ceremonies Liturgies and Ordination and therefore Gentlemen you are desired to take back your own Words with this fair Proposal  Whenever the Church of  England  ceases to quarrel with us about Habits Ceremonies Liturgies and Ordination we are content that those Dissenters which shall after that refuse to Conform may be taxed with being unwilling to have the Breach healed with being obstinate Dissenters or what you please  'Tis an unaccountable Assurance in any Author to advance such a Notion to the World in which had they Power but of Reflection on themselves they must of Necessity see they were in the Wrong  Pray Gentlemen what do you think we differ with you for We hope you are Protestants we have own'd you a true Church and that we differ from you in nothing Doctrinal or absolutely Necessary for Salvation Will ye keep your Words with us Then here is your Challenge answer'd  Get the Convocation to pass it into an Act that the Church will not quarrel with us about  Habits Ceremonies Liturgies and Ordination  the Schism be upon us if we do not Conform  If you can't do this then make us no more Challenges never write to us to tell you upon what Terms we will Conform we are ready to Conform upon your own Terms we take you at your own Words do but perform what you have voluntarily propos'd we are your own  Not but that we have great Reason to say we know very well that this Offer is neither in your Power nor in your Nature not in your Power as private Men not in the Nature of your High Church as a Party  Nor is it any Breach of Charity to say so because we have had so much Experience of your Temper on all Occasions in this Matter and in particular in the Conferences at the  Savoy  where the Dissenters made all the Concessions of Charity and Obedience that they were able to do with any Safety to their Consciences they went through the CommonPrayerBook and propos'd only such Amendment as they found absolutely necessary to make it tolerable to them and their Hearers they offer'd to dispute upon the Amendments they had made and to justifie all their Objections by the Scriptures  In a Word they offer'd to Conform so far as they were able to answer it to God their Consciences and the World and he that requires Men to offer more or else rejects them and shuts them out of their Communion wou'd do well to tell us who are the Authors of the Schism  But after all these Gentlemen by what I can perceive are as ignorant in the thing they call Schism as they seem to be in other Things and we have the Testimony of the House of Lords in which there concurr'd most of the Bishops of the Church of  England  that  the Dissenters are not Schismaticks  See the Reasons of the Lords against the Bill to prevent  Occasional Conformity  And had these Gentlemen bethought themselves when they charge us with this Schism for separating from the Church they would have reflected a little on Mr  Hales  of  Eaton  a Sober and Judicious Divine of the Church of  England  who in his Treatise of Schism lets them know that separating in Communion from any Particular Church is not a Schism if the Persons are not separated from the whole Body of Christians but he that holds the Head holds fast the Faith and does not divide in Faith and Doctrine cannot be said to be guilty of Schism for his refusing to join in Communion with this or that Particular  Church The Church of Christ is that whole Body of Christians however dispers'd all over the World who are united to him by Faith and are the Members composing and join'd to his Mystical Body professing the same Doctrine and Faith tho' divided into never so many several Communities Societies and other Parts  If this be to be Schismaticks 'tis plain the Dissenters are not no Schismaticks and thus we have the Testimony of the Church Ministers we have the Vote of the Church of  England  Bishops and a Majority of the House of Peers that the Dissenters are no Schismaticks  What shall we say now  If the Dissenters are allow'd by the Church not to be Schismaticks and if the House of Lords concur in the Vote and if you will not will not quarrel with us for Habit Ceremonies Liturgy or Ordination  Pray let these Authors tell us what is the Difference among us  The People may soon be united for here is little left to dispute of  What then is it we are treated for in such a Scandalous Manner For what is it we are call'd by Sir  H M  a People unsafe to be trusted with any Part of the Administration In what are we dangerous to the Government In what is it unsafe to trust us Why  Ye are Enemies to Monarchy  and always plotting  against the Government says these Learned and Passionate Authors  Say you so Sirs We will come to an Account of Plots against Monarchy and Government when you will and whenever we do you will be found guilty of more than we  But you have given us a long List of Dissenters Plots as you call them and of People executed for them First of all I believe 'twould be hard to prove the Dissenters were in a Plot every time some of them were hang'd for it And we have seen some Church of  England  Parliaments  Ʋnhang them again  as far as they could to do Justice to their Posterity But I shall not ravel into the List of Dissenters Plots at this time only I cannot avoid telling this Author that he has not given a fair Account of them the Dissenters Sir have been guilty of more Plots against the Government than you charge them with and more have been executed for it than you tell us of for I assure you the Author of this wears a Mourning Ring on his Finger given at the Funeral of Mr  Christopher Love  a Presbyterian Minister Beheaded  Anno  for the horrid Phanatick Plot contriv'd for the bringing in  as they then call'd him Charles Stuart  and the restoring of Monarchy  And now we come to examine a little this Author's preposterous Motion that we should  give in our Grievances to the Convocation Why truly Gentlemen we have Grievances which the Convocation might redress but we don't expect they will and some of them are as follow  I 'Tis our Grievance to be falsly accus'd as Mismanagers of the late Reign when we had little or nothing to do in it as unsafe to the Government when we have all along endeavoured to uphold it as Enemies to Peace when we challenge all our Enemies to testifie who has the greatest Zeal for the Publick Concord the Dissenters or the Church  'Tis our Grievance to be challeng'd to show on what Terms we can Conform and large Concessions offer'd us in the Name of the Convocation by Men who are so far from having any Authority from the Convocation that the Gentlemen of that Assembly do not think it worth while to own what they say or perform what they promise in their Names as it certainly is in this Case  It is a Grievance to us and to the whole Nation that we should at first to gratifie a Party and to fortifie the State Policy of Tricking and Designing Men be driven out and cast off from the ChurchCommunion and the Society of FellowChristians for Trifles and Things Indifferent  Perhaps I am not of so free an Opinion as to the Indifferency of all the Things in which we Differ as the Church themselves but they are allow'd by the Church themselves to be Indifferent and they are particularly Indifferent in the Sense of Indifferency explain'd as before and therefore  ad hominem  they are really Indifferent Even the whole of Church Discipline is so far Indifferent that whether this or that Model be settled either Party are allow'd to be capable of Salvation without prejudice to their Belief in that Head or to speak plain a Man may go to heaven in the Practice of either of them but yet as Conscience directs ought to have Liberty to Chuse for himself  But to be cast out of Christian Communion for Trifles  for such are all the Indifferent Things compar'd to the more Essential Points of Religion  this is a Grievance and this is indeed the Original Grievance and the first Cause of all their Speparation which our Author calls Schism to impose what they own the Scripture does not impose  'Tis my Opinion generally speaking that no Church can justifie keeping out any Person from their Communion for any thing that will not in its own Nature and Circumstances keep him out of Heaven To keep us out of the Communion of the Church for  things which you own we may be saved without will find but slender Authority in the Scripture to Justifie  But after all suppose our Grievances were laid before the Convocation will this Author assure us of Relief this Way Will he undertake to tell us any thing the Convocation has done that Way for any Body Nay will he be pleased to tell us whether that Body who have now Set above Fifteen Years Annually have done one Act or Thing for the Benefit of the Church they Represent Will he please to give the World a History of their Actions and engage to make out they have done any thing but Wrangle among themselves for so long time These Men of Uniformity have they had any Uniform Proceedings  Have they in short  done any thing worthy of themselves or the Church they Represent If they have we would be glad to hear it if they have not to what Purpose should we apply to them for the Healing our Breaches  Besides this let us ask him another Question Do the Convocation agree among themselves Have not some Gentlemen fill'd the World with Volumes and learned Tracts on little Matters relating to Adjournings and Recesses of that Assembly and that one Difficulty seems not yet Master'd and how can we  expect that Spirit of Candor that Temper and Peaceable Mind which is absolutely necessary to bring to pass so great a Blessing as this of a Protestant Union How can we look for it from an Assembly that cannot Decide their own Controversies nor Heal their own Breaches  Upon the whole it seems to me this Man of Gall has overshot himself has gone beyond his Commission and has made a Proposal he had no Authority for and promised for People that will not perform for him  Wherefore upon the whole Matter as we have small Reason to hope for a Reconciliation of Principles I think the present Business of the Nation is to arrive at a Reconciliation of Parties a Conjunction of Interests a General Union of Affection where there cannot be a Union of Opinions that the Strife of Parties and Factions may cease and that Clamour and Contention may be at an end  Could this be brought to pass it would really be the greatest Step towards Conjunction in Religious Matters  First This would make our Charity extensive and we should not make it our constant business to Accuse but Excuse One Another Reproachful Terms and Marks of Distinction would die of course Protestant  would be the Common Name of all Opinions  God be prais'd we are all of One Religion in  England  tho' we Differ about Methods We pretend to be all Travelling to Heaven tho' we fall out by the Way and we fall out about the Way too But if every man disturb'd himself less about the Course his Neighbour Steers and concern'd himself more about his own there would more find the right Way thither  as far as Humane Conduct is concern'd in the Voyage to Heaven  As to the Dissenters in  England  they are Misrepresented to the Nation that they are for Tumults and Rebellions Insurrections and pulling down Monarchy and Governments enough has been said here and elsewhere to Invite the Accusers to a fair Debate but the present Case chiefly respects their Interest They are not a Small nor a Poor Sort in the Nation The old Proverb of Intrest won't lye is on their side  Men of Estates are never for pulling down Houses Burning Towns and Ruining Nations  'tis Natural for Trading Men to be Wise for themselves 'tis Men of Desperate Fortunes are for Embroiling Kingdoms and setting States and Governments into a Flame  The Dissenters in  England  generally speaking are the Men of Trade and Industry and what Estates they have lye principally in Stock of Goods Houses and Credit No  Publick Disaster can befal the Nation but what affects their Estates more than other Mens Banks Stocks Trade Foreign and Domestick These are the first Things that suffer on any Publick Disorder and none of those People who are thus Embark'd in Trade can be properly thought to desire Disasters and Revolutions because they are generally the first that feel it  There may indeed be some Men among them that want Principles and may Act ill but these are few and not Remarkable the generality of the Dissenters must be blind to their own Interests as well as Enemies to the Government and their Neighbours when they promote Factions and Divisions in the State  It may not be amiss to observe in this Case what I Appeal to any Man's Judgment in besides my own in the particular Article of Stocks in the City when the People are uneasie at any Publick Matters and the Prospect of Affairs looks with an ill Aspect  the Stocks fall  again on the contrary when they are easie the Stocks rise and the StockJobbers frequently Manage such Occasions and on this Head 'tis observ'd That in the Case of a certain Bill depending in the House when the People thought it would be pass'd Stocks fell again when the talk of it began  to be laid aside  as it really was for some time  all Stocks rose in Price and when it came to a Period they still advanc'd again  Not that I Argue from hence that the Dissenters are the Chief Parties Interessed in the Stocks for 'tis plain they are not but from hence may be seen by any Man who does not put out his own Eyes the great Benefit of Peace and Union the Effect it has on Trade Credit and the Value of Estates  Besides the Author of this Book discovers a Spirit of too much Rancor and Malice to make it fit to talk with him I am told he is not an  English  man and indeed he seems not to be an  English  man by his furious way of Treating the  English  Nation at a time when they are all inclin'd to peace with one another the least thing can be said of him in this Case is that he discovers Impotent Rage at a People who God be prais'd are out of his Reach and the Remnant of his Railing Talent may lye either against the Lords who have rejected the  Occasional Bill  on whom without doubt he will plentifully bestow the usual Titles of a Faction a Party LowChurch Men and the like  Or else he may give himself a Loose at the Queen who several of his Habit  for we understand he is a Brother of the Gown  have left off to pray for except at Church where  they cannot help it and as Mrof  HighWickham  has entirely left Her Majesty out of his Grace after Meat ever since Her Speech to the Houses of Parliament for Peace and Union so these Gentlemen may be expected with him to give Her Majesty a Cast of their Foul Language as soon as they dare do it  But one Word with this Gentleman and then I conclude and that is about Plotting for the Dissenters have been his Plotters and his Rebels all along and have on all Occasions been very roughly handled by him as to Associations Treasons Rebellions and the like  Now I would fain desire this Gentleman to tell us a little News about a Plot in  Scotland  Her Majesty has given Her Parliament an Account that She has Unquestion'd Information of a Plot in  Scotland  for our parts we expected it from the Malignancy of the Party there but now a Declaration of its Unquestion'd reality from the Throne has put the Matter of Fact out of Question  Now as this Gentleman keeps a very good Correspondence there which appears by his own Writing I could most earnestly recommend to him to inform the World how many Dissenters or Presbyterians there are concerned in it  Without doubt he can make it appear there are  no HighChurchmen in it  for they Good Men are of such untainted Principles as to Loyalty they are so true to the Doctrine of Passive Obedience and NonResistance that 'tis impossible they can ever be concern'd in any such thing no no it must all go upon the poor Papists those Roman Catholicks are sad Fellows they are always plotting and these Whigs and Dissenters they must have a Hand in it just as this Author says they had in the Fire of  London  the Dissenters were indeed very eager to set the Nation in a Flame when they set Fire to their own Houses to begin it  But alas for us What shall we say now if it may be prov'd that here are a great many Highflying Churchmen in this Plot Then  the Wolf will be stript indeed  What if here should be  Depos'd Bishops NonJurant Parsons  and  HighChurch Episcoparian Scotsmen  in this Plot against the Queen and Her Goverment What shall we say then Why I'll tell you what they will say they'll say that Presbyterian Tyranny has drove them to such Extremities that Flesh and Blood could bear no longer To which I shall answer Not at all granting the Truth of Fact that just as much had the Rebels atand  BothwellBridge  to say That Episcopal Prelatick Tyranny drove  them to such Extremities that Flesh and Blood could bear no longer  From whence I draw this short Inference That whether they are Churchmen or Dissenters one Religion or another when Men think themselves oppress'd let their Principles and Pretence be what they will they will always forget those Pretences Nature will prevail they will attempt their Freedom and seek by Force to resist Force  Church of  England  Church of  Rome  Church of  Scotland  Church of  France  any Church in the World  Whene'er they are Oppress'd they will Rebel  But one thing we must tell these Gentlemen they differ from their Brother Rebels in that they have plotted and rebell'd with half the Oppressions and Tyranny as others have done before them  And if ever these Gentlemen please to compare the  Sad and Doleful Sufferings  of the Episcopal Dissenters in  Scotland  of  which they have made so much Noise  with the Miseries Murthers Plunders and Barbarous Usage of the Dissenters in  Scotland  for Years before it will be easily seen which had the most Cause to cry out of  Flesh and Blood being able to bear no longer  and whenever they please to enter  into the Detail of these Things we are ready to join Issue with them on this Head  The Author or Authors of this Wolfish Book would have done well to have taken Advice from a Gentleman of their own Party and who writes on the same Subject who has said much more to the Purpose and in Language much more suitable to common Civility and good Manners I mean the Author of a Book Entituled  Ʋnion to the Church of  England  Freely Offer'd and Earnestly Recommended to the Dissenters from it of all Perswasions but particularly to the Occasional Conformists  Now tho' I am of the Opinion that the Arguments that Gentleman makes use of may be answer'd yet I must acknowledge to his Honour that while on the one Hand he discovers himself to be of HighChurch Principles yet he shew himself a Man of Temper a Scholar and a Gentleman and if ever he is replied to ought to be treated accordingly the Candor with which he treats the Party he writes against at least deserves this Acknowledgment that he is the first of that Side that has used them civilly and is thereby just so much the harder to be confuted for railing is much larger answer'd than Argument  I leave Dr  Davenant  and to answer those Parts of the Scurrilous Invectives relating  to them which 'tis not so much a Question whether they can as whether 'tis worth while for them or any Body else to reply to so much Railery  Nor indeed had this been wrote but to repeat to the World how willing the Dissenters are at all times to enter into the Merits of the Cause to let the World see the Reasons of their Dissent and how willing they are upon such Concessions as Reason and Conscience calls for to come to a general Union with their Protestant Brethren notwithstanding all the Misrepresentation of HighChurch Malice to the contrary  FINIS
