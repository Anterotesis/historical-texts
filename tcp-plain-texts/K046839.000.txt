 THE TOWN  A SATIRE  Oh that I'd had in those blest Times my Birth  E'er Coxcomb Pies or Coxcombs were on Earth  POPE  By  W KENRICK  LONDON  Printed for R GRIFFITHS at the  Dunciad  in  LudgateStreet    Price One Shilling  THE TOWN  _WISE was the Clown who when he first descried  London  the Seat of Vanity and Pride  And saw the Clouds that o'er it's Turrets spread  Gravely stood still and shook his cautious Head  What can this mean the Portent is not good  See Heav'n has mark'd it with a sulph'rous Cloud  Some Danger's near this Warning is not vain  Then turn'd him back and travell'd home again  How happy they who never yet have known  The num'rous Follies of the noisy Town  Where Affectation joins to low Conceit  And fills with Coxcombs ev'ry crowded Street  All seek intent for what is new Today  And Noise and Nonsense bear them all away  At  Paulin  's  Long  's behold the glorious Trade  How the Fools swarm to get in Masquerade  That's done TonightTomorrow something new  Again with equal Appetite pursue  To  Broughton  's see the tender Stripling goes  To hear the Battle and to see the Blows  Some  A Plac√® of Resort among some Wits  H  's calls where snuffing Punsters meet  And all the Company is plagu'd with Wit  So great the Virtue of the strong  Rappee  That ev'ry Pinch creates a Repartee  Strange Power in Dust be  H  's all the Gain  Whose wond'rous Art can thus affect the Brain  Strait let his Shop commence a publick School  To teach the Blockhead and instruct the Fool  'Twas here the Player took his first Degrees  Who wrote a Farce then help'd his Farce to please  Here first establish'd was he call'd a Wit  And since has charm'd the World with what he writ  In vain dull Songsters  A barbarous and favourite Song on Woman at  Vaux Hall  Woman  's Praise rehearse  His  Peggy  proves the mighty Power of Verse  His  Vocal Shell  what Shell soe'er it be  Speaks a just Taste of senseless Poetry  Pleas'd may the  Mrs Wfgn  Fair review each charming Line  By her inspir'd and think herself divine  Yet Oh how mortal on a sudden grown  To be the singsong Ballad of the Town  Hail mighty  Gk  Chief amidst the Throng  Of leading Nonsense and of Apish Song  To thee with Joy the Herd of Fools submit  And  Curse me Fellow  's current Coin for Wit  Thy keenest Satire bears the silliest Phrase  And Oh how much unworthy of our Praise  Pleasing the Character you set to View  For Fools are ever pleas'd with what is new  The mean Infection catches thro' the Street  And see a  A Character too much known and practis'd to need Explanation  Fribble  ev'ry Fop we meet  So great the  Miss in her Teens  fav'rite Work  so learn'd so wise  One Fool is lash'd and thence lo ten arise  A Fool's a resolute and sturdy Beast  And thy weak Hand but tickles him at best  How much we owe to such a Pen as thine  Where Blockheads with the Satyrist combine  First taught by thee they boast the strange Pretence  To satire Coxcombs while they murder Sense  Fondly they write each other's Follies down  And quite forget those Follies are their own  As once a Fool beheld his antick Face  And saw his Visage in the Magick Glass  Surpriz'd he saw and this Construction made  A Man is wond'rous strange with such a Head  Then laugh'd to view the Oddness of the Phiz  But little thought the monstrous Picture his  So when a Fop 'gainst Fops a Satire reads  He smiles whene'er he thinks the Victim bleeds  Again the Tale insensibly pursues  And struck afresh afresh the Smile renews  See 'mongst the Crowd new endless Follies rise  Whilst all for Wit contend a glorious Prize  Each Blockhead boasts how just his own Pretence  And proves how much he wants of common Sense  The spruce young Templar or th'affected Cit  Maintains his Title as a firstrate Wit  Prates of the Playhouse"I was there Today  "Saw the Rehearsal of a new writ Play  "'Bout which the Manager's in Doubt perplex'd  "To bring it out this Season or the next"  Of all the Coxcombs that infest the Age  None like the Politicians of the Stage  Those Dupes to Wit who ever boldly say  They know as much as others wise as they  Eternal Bablers yet they boast to know  More than the Managers or Actors do  Name but a Play they've seen it o'er and o'er  And Speeches could rehearse if need a Score  Beg but the Favour they would one repeat  Puff'd up with Vanity and loud Conceit  With op'ning Lungs for never they refuse  To tear the Product of a worthy Muse  They plague your Ears then fly the Place or stay  To see a barb'rous Murder on a Play  As soon I'd go to  Smithfield  's dirty Fair  And bear the Gabbling of a stroling Player  As soon I'd be in  Jamesstreet  Hovel seen  Where lowliv'd 'Prentices play  Tamerlane  Or at the  Wells  where bawling Butchers wait  And the fit Theme is wretched  Barnwell  's Fate  As wou'd I go where Fools like these resort  The Curse of Company the Publick Sport  Yet say what Place is free from Folly now  Where do we lose the Fop's affected Bow  Where doth the Dunce attentive silent sit  Or where the Blockhead fear to trust his Wit  At  W  's behold the Fools and Coxcombs there  But Fools and Coxcombs in a higher Sphere  There Lords and Knights fill up the crowded Room  And Rakes polite that from the Bagnio come  There Whisper Nonsense Apes embroider'd Cloaths  Make up the sweet Society of Beaux  Sense scorn'd by all the worthless House denies  And  W  's remains a Box of Butterflies  Hold cries a Friend that at my Elbow sits  What meddle with the Great you've lost your Wits  Perchance some Lord your Verses may receive  And when they've Money Lords you know can give  Besides there's some may boast a good Pretence  However strange it seem to Wit and Sense  Well Sir suppose your just Assertion true  That some Great Man is near as wise as you  If 'mongst the Fools  St  James  's Coffeehouse  St  James  's constant Guest  How shall we know to mark him from the rest  But think not I wou'd e'er so meanly serve  Shew Verses to my Lord then hope and starve  Such be the Fate of ev'ry rhiming Fool  Who learn'd to pen his wretched Lines at School  Like  C  's self wrote Odes at Twelve to show  Odes writ at Twelve are better Odes than now  Dull Asses void of Genius or of Thought  And write so Parrots prate as once they're taught  Ds  to those he had by Physick slain  So sung to tell 'em how to rise again  Finely describes how  Vide  Dr

the Author on the  Passions of Man  Dedicated to the Earl of  Chesterfield  mighty Work address'd  But not by  Stanhope  's Name it's Worth confess'd  Man's  dreadful  Passion was the  dreadful  Verse  But  The Author of it  Rd  's Passion was the greatest Curse  He call'd the Muse and begg'd her quick Relief  In vain he call'd for oh the Muse was deaf  Then down he sat and rack'd his brainless Head  And swore to write and writ without her Aid  Oh could I hope to catch th' exalted Fires  Which drop'd from Heav'n the sacred Muse inspires  Glad o'er the World the noisy World I'd fly  And taste the various Beauties of the Sky  I'd seek the Groves and make the Dwelling mine  Where dwell the Graces and the tuneful Nine  There wish to live in one continu'd Day  Where bright  Urania  sings and heavenly Muses play  How vain the Wish the Prospect's vanish'd quite  New Scenes of Folly rush upon my Sight  What loads of Paper destin'd to the Press  To bear the dull Impressions of an Ass  Who takes th' Advantage of a senseless Age  And cheats the Reader with a Title Page  Of such the  An Ode inscrib'd to  Ralph Allen  Esq  of  Bath  for which it's conjectur'd the Author has robb'd some poor Bellman of his yearly Verses  solitary  tuneless Ode  With nought of Solitude nor ought of Good  Cease worthless Tribe and give your Scribbling o'er  If you would gain Applause then write no more  That Maxim's taught in all our publick Schools  That Silence is the best Recourse of Fools  Yet how perverse ye wander from the Right  As if you would be Blockheads out of Spight  Whilst all your Study and your utmost Care  Is to be viler Asses than ye are  Yet each one thinks the more a Fool he grows  The more he has of Wit the more he knows  Thus of all Follies that possess the Brain  The Coxcomb's greatest Curse is to be vain  E'en sacred Temples are not sacred now  For Fops and Fools intrude where'er you go  Tho' Coxcombs ever are too vain to pray  They go for Company as to the Play  See  Clody  enter in the Velvet Pew  He comes Today because his Cloaths are new  His Head he turns his Body turns withal  Or else the Buckle of his Hair might fall  He coughs aloud to tell the Ladies by  Who plagues the ChurchHemLadies see'tis I  Now down he sits still peeping at the Fair  Pulls out a Mirrour to adjust his Hair  Lays out the  Dresden  settles ev'ry Pleat  Each Atom's set his LapDog's scarce so neat  But on a sudden see the Mortal grieve  For oh a dreadful Spot upon his Sleeve  Pain insupportable too much to bear  But Thanks to Heaven his Cordial Drops are near  But see he goes and leaves each sneering Fair  Forsakes the Bishop and the godly Pray'r  E'en Priests themselves just Satire cannot pass  Nor is the Bishop free if he's an Ass  How oft the Chaplain flies from serving God  Strips off his Gown and turns a Man of Mode  The low Priz'd Reader skips the Collects o'er  To get a Breakfast with a gen'rous Whore  In Brothels see the Priest a lech'rous Swine  Dead drunk Tonight Tomorrow's a Divine  These  Britain  these your pious Teachers are  If these not all but others boast your Care  How many such whom senseless Learning makes  As wretched Blockheads as the others Rakes  Holdholdagain thus interrupts my Friend  Stop here good Sir and let your Satire end  How vain how needless give the Purpose o'er  Folly's a boundless Sea without a Shore  As the light Bark is on the Waters tost  Thy Pen's amidst the floating Billows lost  As soon you might the Sea's mad Wave contain  As Folly's wide Prerogative restrain  Nor Fops nor Fools you ever can destroy  For who will mind the Satire of a Boy  Yet still in vain I curb th' unruly Pen  Still it pursues and strikes at Fools again  But what Misfortune has the Verse befell  Convey'd how sudden to the crowded Mall  Here Folly reigns behold her num'rous Tribe  Which Fool which Coxcomb shall I first describe  Lost in the thronging Tumult of Conceit  The Verse relents and Satire would retreat  But now too late no Way is left to go  Plac'd in between a Blockhead and a Beau  Here doom'd to bear the vast Impertinence  Of Wretches void of Learning as of Sense  See now a Train of Ladies sailing by  Strait whips the double Concave to the Eye  The Laugh the Sneer the Look without the Glass  Denote the Blockhead and confirm the Ass  There stalks a Creature some might call a Man  Playing the Monkey with a Lady's Fan  Lo there a blust'ring Hector from the Wars  Behind a Row of Smockfac'd Sons of  Mars  Here Fools of ev'ry KindFops Rakes and Cits  Among the rest the worst of Fools the Wits  Say where shall those who Sense or Thought admire  Free undisturb'd amidst the Town retire  NoHere's no Safety here no Refuge found  Where Nonsense rules and Vanities abound  Behold the Stage where  Shakespear  once could charm  And  Rowe  with sacred Fire each Bosom warm  E'en there low Folly finds a kind Retreat  Whilst  Shakespear  's trod beneath the Dancer's Feet  To what low Ebb is Taste and Judgment grown  That Sense must need a Dance to please the Town  Soft  Otway  's Lines sound tedious to the Pit  And  expectant for  A favourite Dancer  Auretti  sit  Blush senseless Audience blush to see a Play'r  Whose Sounds of Sense should charm th' attentive Ear  Go silent off or seldom more can boast  Than the poor Gall'ry's halfstrain'd Praise at most  Yet if  Auretti  Janeton  shakes her slender Feet  How the loud Thunder clatters thro' the Pit  How oft we see the Hero half divine  In noble Worth and gen'rous Passion shine  We see him fetch the last dear parting Breath  And greatly bear the Agonies of Death  Lo the Scene shifts and see the Hero pass  A mimick Sir and now is turn'd an Ass  How ill proportion'd what a monstrous Thing  Thus  Abel Drugger  a low Character of Mr  Gk  's in  Ben Johnson's Alchymist  It were to be wish'd that Persons of great Abilities for the Stage instead of being seen in the mean Characters they often are would study and play those more suitable to their Capacities and to the Taste of Judges of Theatrical Performances  Nab  Tomorrow swells into a King  No Wonder Follies thus o'errun the Stage  Since nought but Folly takes the senseless Age  What Shame to see as I myself have seen  When wellplay'd  An admirable Character in  Shakespear's Merchant of Venice  then beautifully represented by Mr  Macklin Jan  st  Shylock  grac'd the lively Scene  A StageBox Beau who sat a finish'd Ass  And play'd at  Peepbo  with a SpyingGlass  Coxcomb such Wretches would I more despise  Than Ideots Nature ne'er intended wise  Expell'd the House was ev'ry Fool like these  More Men of Sense would come less Farces please  F  by himself had mimick'd o'er his Tea  For  F  and  At least in the Character of  Punch  Fool alike in Sound agree  But  Bn  calls fly thither strait my Pen  Again he calls the BullDog barks again  The Kennel openssee the wretched Crew  How base the Scene presented to the View  Among the Boxers see my Lord and 'Squire  All Hounds alike for all the Pack admire  But lo the Curs for bloody Fight prepare  And roaring Oaths loud bellow desp'rate War  Whilst all the Gall'ry is in Praises lost  On him the worthiest Cur that worries most  So when two Mastiffs better Dogs than they  In  James  's Market mix the noisy Fray  Before the snarly Fight is half begun  Lo hooting Butchers from the Shambles run  Redoubled Noise promotes the fav'rite Cause  Whilst the poor Curs lose Blood and gain Applause  But see the Kennel turn'd a publick School  Where 'Squires and Coachmen may be Brutes by Rule  Mufflers for those the naked Fist may fright  For here young Lords and Puppies learn to fight  Did  Britain  boast no better Arts than these  Let ev'ry worthless Art in  Britain  cease  A Boxer be the Great Man's constant Guest  And ev'ry Man of Fortune turn a BEAST  FINIS
