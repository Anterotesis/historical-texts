arms  are laid up is a most noble and magnificent structure It stands north of the White Tower and extends in length about a hundred and thirty yards in depth about twenty It was begun in the reign of king James the second and finished in king William's  You go in at the west end of this grand building behind the chapel and ascend a spacious and lofty  staircase at the head of which you turn to your right hand and entering the room before you you will see one of the greatest curiosities in its kind ever formed by the art of man Here are arms we are told sufficient for a hundred thousand men at a minute's warning laid up in a most surprizing artificial order and beauty all bright and clean to admiration  Just within the door on the left hand are first two lofty beatiful pyramids of pistols standing upon the crown globe and sceptre in curious carved work  The second is called a wilderness of arms that is pikes carbines muskets bayonets halberts swords pistols  c  so laid up that you have a prospect through all their ranges to the farther end of the  room which is three hundred and fortyfive feet long the sight of which is enough to strike one with wonder and amazement  The

conquered  France with his flaming sword in his hand he took more men prisoners than he had in his army  Next is the figure of a fiery serpent the head and tail of carved work the body of pistols  Facing the window at the east end is the form of a large and beautiful organ made with six thousand pistols ten story or ranges high  Between the windows at the same end is the representation of the Hydra or sevenheaded monster three of which heads are above and four below and not one like the other all of carved work  Next is king Henry the sixth's armour he was crowned king of France his father conquered the country and this prince lost it  The first curiosity on the other side coming back again is the figure of Jupiter in his fiery chariot drawn by eagles in the clouds with a thunderbolt in his hand in carved work guarded round with bayonets  Second is the star and garter made of pistols and bayonets with the thistle rose and crown over head in carved work and below  are birds and other curious creatures in fine carved work  All the way down on this side are the same figures of arms  c  answerable to those we described in going up on the other  Lastly you are shewn a great parcel of arms taken in the assassination plot against king William particularly a blunderbus  with which the conspirators designed to have shot that prince as he rid in his coach to Hamptoncourt this hangs up over head below near the bottom is a carbine with which Charnock designed to have shot him as he rode a hunting  Hence are likewise several arms taken in Scotland in the last rebellion particularly a curious piece of  the late lord Mar's and a large broad sword with which a highlander struck general Evans and cut him through his hat wig and skullcap  There are in this small Armoury besides these principal curiosities which I have mentioned many fine things which my young readers will be highly delighted to see  Here you pay  Threepence  The next curiousity is the train of artillery  CHAP II  Of the fine train of artillery  THE grand storehouse where this curious train of artillery is kept is directly under the small Armoury upon the ground floor where there  are a great number of curious

other brass fieldpieces of various sizes and on the walls  c  a multitude of instruments made use of in war such as crows ladles  wedges screws handspikes and spunges and harness for the horses which draw the train  c  Over head you see a trophy of standards colours  c  as in Guildhall taken in the last war with France  And lastly in going out there are two very curious brass cannon twenty four pounders taken at Vigo  anno  by the  present lord Cobham The breeches of these guns represent couching lions  Here you pay  Two pence  each person  Next you proceed to the Horse Armoury  CHAP III  Of the Horse Armoury  HERE you are first presented with a  view of the sigures of the horse guards that attend the kings whom you will see presently all on horseback in bright armour of polished steel and ranged in beautiful order on the other side of the house as also of a great number of footguards standing between the horse  c  Second over head is the famous lance of Charles Brandon duke of

the comical figure of Will Somers jester to king Henry the eighth He is called an honest man of woman's makingwears his horns upon his head to prevent the making holes in his pocket and because he was dimsighted he would  believe neither the king queen nor any of the court that he was a cuckold till he had put his spectacles on with which he is represented by way of ridicule to this day  Eleventh is an ill favoured old instrument called the  collar of torment  which we are told was formerly put about the necks of such women as either proved false to their husbands  beds or took too great a freedom with their tongues  But long this collar has aside been cast  Sure they are now less noisy and more chaste  Now we come to the kings on horseback who are placed in the following order First a

cieling of this fine Armoury where all the abovementioned curiosities are deposited are every where ornamented with ancient breastplates swords  c  For the sight of the whole  each person pays  Twopence  I have now told my young readers all the fine things that I know of in this pompous place excepting one  And that's a secret  Which king Harry has to show  And so it must remains  Till they to men and women grow  We next proceed to the Regalia  CHAP IV  Of the Regalia in the Jewel Office  THE inestimable treasures which we are now to give our young readers a particular account of are deposited or laid up in a dark strong stone room about twenty yards distant from the east end of the new Armoury  First the imperial crown with which all the kings of England have been crowned since the time of Edward the confessor It is a very rich crown of gold embellished with pearls and precious stones of divers kinds namely diamonds rubies emeralds and saphires with a mound of gold on the

the rich crown of state which his majesty wears on his throne in parliament It is embellished with divers large rose and table diamonds and other precious stones but most remarkable for a wonderful large ruby set in the  middle of one of the crosses vauled at ten thousand pounds and upwards as also for the large emerald which is seven inches round a pearl the finest in the world and a ruby of inestimable value  Eleventh his royal highness the prince of Wales's rich crown  This and the crown of state last mentioned whenever his majesty goes to  the parliamenthouse are carried by the keeper of the jeweloffice attended by one or two of the warders of the Tower privately in a hackney coach to Whitehall where they are delivered to the proper officers who with some yeomen of the guard carry them to the robing rooms where his majesty and the prince dress themselves His majesty wears  his crown on his head whilst on the throne and that belonging to the prince is placed before him to shew

inches the wings whereof expand about seven inches The weight of the whole is about ten ounces This and the spoon are curiosities of great antiquity  There are besides the inestimable treasures above particularly mentioned several cuirous and valuable pieces of plate and other rich furniture not usually exposed to publick view a particular description of which would be too redious to be here inserted  However for the further information and amusement of our little readers we shall close this  chapter with a poetical account of the bold and unparalleled attempt of a desperate villain with others of his associates to strip the jeweloffice of the royal crown globe sceptre  c  with the happy prevention of their wicked design in which had they succeeded the loss could never have been repaired  THE WOLF in SHEEPS CLOATHING or the VILLAIN TRIUMPHANT  Now my young readers lend an ear  And you a matchless Tale shall hear  How one in a canonick gown  Pilfer'd away old England's crown  And how which aggrandiz'd the matter  The globe and sceeptre sollowed after  But watchful providence decreed  To bring to light so dark a deed  In gay king Charles the second's days  So readers my historian says  One Blood  Blood was the son of a blacksmith in Ireland a fellow that thought small villanies below him He once rescued a comrade of his out of the hands of the sheriff's officers as they were leading him to the gallows At another time be laid a design in Ireland to surprize the castle of Dublin c and to usurp the government But being discovered by the duke of Ormond he vowed revenge Accodingly one night he with some of his associates went boldly up to the coach took him out of it and tied him fust behind one of his comrades who role away with him but the duke throwing him off his horse and procuring assistance got released Blood losing his repulation among his fellow rogues through this miscarriage resolved to make amends by a more daring villany that of stealing the Regalia  one Parrot  Parrot was a silkdyer in Southwark and in the Rebellion had been majorgeneral Harrison's lieutenant  and another  The other was named Hunt a son in law of Blood's and trained up under him  Notorious rogue their friend and brother  Laid a bold scheme in one half hour  To seize the treasures of the Tower  The better to secure success  Blood strait put on a parson's dress  And took his wife an artful jade  Well yers'd in the Mercurialtrade  The art of thieving    To see the jewels in the Tower  And stay'd at least full half an hour  Madam  Blood's wife  at length sunk gently down  Into an artificial swoon  Blood saintlike lifted up his eyes  And feign'd a husband's fond surprize  One Edwards  The jewelkeeper' wife  who ther kept the house  With great indulgence treats his spouse  Calls for assistance holds her head  And leads her gently up to bed  With eyes half clos'd th' imposton fell  Slunber'd an hour and all was well  The parson at departure said  How shall this goodness be repaid  Hence a firm friendship was profest  And gifts his gratitude exprest  In shortto ripen the design  Of this archvillain sham divine  He made an offer quickly after  To wed his  One who he pretended had three hundred a year in land which was at his disposal  nephew with her daughter  Her husband lik'd the proposition  Writings were drawn with expedition  Fix'd in an instant was the day  The memorable ninth of May  On which the bold attempt was made  The crown was stoln the villains fled  And  He was keeper of the jeweloffice  Edwards left at home for dead  Treason and murder soon was cry'd  The crown beneath Blood's gown was 'spy'd  And Parrot being before suspected  Was with the globe conceal'd detected  Thus the Regalia were recover'd  And thousands round the villains hover'd  Both were in irons quickly laid  And to the Tower White Tower convey'd  Soon they were summon'd to Whitehall  Where to the king Blood own'd it all  Fearless he added to't a lye  Told him of a conspiracy  If He or Parrot once should dye  Of men who would in ambush lay  And take his precious life away  But if they met with his compassion  They'd prove of service to the nation  The king sore frightened at that time  Not only pardon'd the bold crime  But what is monstrous to declare  Gave Blood five hundred pounds a year  CHAP V  Of the Line Batteries  c  THE line is a narrow neat paved way just within the battlements of the wall which surrounds the Tower upon this line which is about half a mile in compass are four batteries which by means thereof have an  easy communication one with another  The first entrance upon the line is just beyond Traitor's bridge where is a clean paved walk about seventy yards long called the  ladies walk  because 'tis much frequented by the fair sex in summer evenings On the left hand is a pleasant row of shady trees extending from the one end to the  other and on the right the wall which encompasseth the Tower over which is a delightful prospect of the river Thames with the ships boats  c  passing up and down as also of the wharf belonging to the Tower on which are planted sixty one large iron cannon  At the farther end of the ladies walk you descend the steps and going  on a little way you ascend the line again where presently you come to the first six gun battery which commands the river to the fouth here stands a centinel as there does likewise at each of the other batteries  A few yards from this battery at the east end of the Tower you come to the second six gun battery which has likewise a  DEVIL  upon  DUTY  command of the river This is called the  divil's battery  the origin of which story is as follows  Of the Devil's Battery  HEAR now young readers how it came  To bear that hideous frightful name  The tale is merry tho' 'tis old  Then take it as to me 'twas told  As once a centinel was put  To guard this little eastern spot  Soon as 'twas dark before his eyes  A shocking spectre did arise  Of bulk enormous full as tall  As either giant in Guildhall  And what still made him look the bolder  He bore a cannon on his shoulder  The soldier frighten'd quits his post  And looks as pale as any ghost  Flies to his corporal who was near  And tells the groundwork of his fear  Bless me he cry'd what shall I do  I've seen old Satan 'faith 'tis true  Return for shame the corporal said  Let's go and shoot old Satan dead  Onwards they march the corporal spies  The devil with his saweer eyes  Fearles at once Don Quixote fir'd  Down dropt the devil or retir'd  Hence let the fact be how it will  'Tis call'd the devil's bettery still  From this battery at about two hundred yards distance you come to a spacious strong stone battery where there are  eight large iron cannon mounted This battery is at the north corner of the east end of the Tower From thence you pass on to the fourth battery where there are six guns which point towards the north The guns are fired from all these batteries and from those also of the wharf on some particular rejoicing days such as the king's birthday  being the th of October and his return from abroad and from the wharf alone on all other royal holidays and likewise as often as his majesty goes to the parliament house and on the th of May th of November  c  From the last battery we proceed to the royal mint where all the gold silver and copper coins  and medals are struch belonging to the management of which there are several officers of whom the warden is chief  I could very willingly give my young readers a particular account of the art of making of money but I am afraid it might tempt some naughty persons to counterfeit the current coin for which I should be justly blamed  and become in some measure accessary to the fatal consenquences that might attend it  CHAP VI  Of the inside of the White tower  I Must first inform my young readers that the inside of this grand Tower  is not publickly shewn but as they in proceeding from one place to the other in order to see the rarities pass by it two or three times and will very likely be inquisitive to know what is with inside I shall therefore endeavour to satisfy their curiousity  This Tower is a large magazine or vast storehouse filled with prodigious numbers of various  kinds of instruments of war The vaults which perhaps are the largest and finest in all the world are filled with bags of salt petre for the making of gunpowder Upon the first sloor are several spacious rooms one of which is a small armoury for the sea service for ten thousand men Which arms are of various sorts very curious and laid up in beautiful order  In another room are a multitude of fine closets presses and lockers all filled with an almost incredible number of tools for the war service As to gunpowder there is but little kept in this place only so much as will serve for the use of the garrison This Tower has three very high stories and upon the top of all fine leads and what is  surprizing water from the Thames is forced by an engine to the top of this lofty Tower where it fills a cistern of about seven feet deep nine broad and about sixty feet in length being the biggest that I ever saw or heard of  The walls of this strong Tower are at the groundfloor one and twenty feet thick at the second  about sixteen feet and at the third about seven feet thick At the south side of this White Tower is a room formerly a chapel where are kept the ancient records of this nation  I shall next tell my readers the time and ceremony of opening and shutting the gates of the Tower and so conclude this history  CHAP VII  Of the ceremony of opening and shutting the gates of the Tower  AT half an hour after nine o'clock at night the bell on the top of the governor's house rings to warn the inhabitants or others to go out or come into the garrison as their  affairs may require At the same time the drum beats over the spur guard at the entrance into the Tower to give notice to the soldiers who are absent from duty to come in likewise at ten aclock the tattoo beats  Go to bed Tom  from the main guard which is at the west side of the white Tower quite round the Tower to the place from whence they set out  At eleven o'clock which is the hour they lock up the gates both in winter and summer the yeoman porter calls a serjeant and a file fo men to attend the keys to lock up the royal Tower who proceed with him to the spur guard or outer gates which being secured they go back to the main guard where the yeoman porter cries  God bless the king  the guard who are drawn up in order answer  Amen  From thence they go to the governor's house where they lodge the keys after which no person upon any account whatsoever can either go out or come into the Tower till next morning when the same ceremony is again observed at opening the gates in the summer at half an hour after five  and in the winter at seven  About half and hour after nine before they look up the Tower one of the warders with a guard of soldiers upon duty locks up the gates upon the wharf and drawing up the drawbridge locks the gate which leads to it and so retires into the Tower after which no person can go out or come in  Having now shut the gates of the Tower I have nothing more to add concerning the curiosities of this place but I beg leave to inform my young readers that the  History of Westminster Abbey  is now in hand and will be got ready for the press with all convenient speed Subscribers are desired to bring or send their names to  Thomas Boreman  Bookseller in
