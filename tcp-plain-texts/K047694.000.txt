on the Town and an Injustice to the Memory of the inimitable  BEN JOHNSON  should I publish this Play without acknowledging that most part of the Plot some of the Scenes and many of the Speeches are almost literally copied from a dramatic Work of his with the same Title An Attempt at altering a Piece of his is I believe unprecedented and indeed bold for one who never before either burthen'd the Press with his Labours or dar'd the Critic's Censure I was allur'd to the Task by a Number of very noble Sentiments which are scattered through the Original in many Lines neither harsh or unmusical wherein there seems to breath the true inspir'd Spirit of Poetry and fancy plays within her proper Sphere under the Restraint of a well temper'd critical Judgment but much more by the strong Contrast of virtuous and vicious Characters with which I found it adorn'd which is the most useful laudable and consequently the fundamental Part of the  DRAMA  To reduce the Multiplicity of Characters the Train of Incidents to make the Parts of  LIVIA  and  AGRIPPINA  somewhat interesting which in  JOHNSON  are very near despicable to select his Beauties and by proper Means to bring about the Catastrophe seem'd at first an Enterprize as difficult as toiling for Wealth in a Mine and almost startled me from my Design But however as I had begun I determined to proceed and of my Success the Perusal of the Piece will make you a Judge  JOHNSON  's strict Adherence to History in his two Plays of  SEJANUS  and  Catiline  would have been highly commendable had it not been manifestly prejudicial to him since he has been so scholastically nice as scarcely to omit a single Person or Incident mention'd in the Lives of these  great wicked  Men nay he has even translated literally in his  SEJANUS  several Lines from  CORNELIUS TACITUS  By this Means his Tragedies became rather dramatic Histories than Entertainments suited to a modern Theatre From this I have ventur'd to deviate I have kept  CAESAR  at  ROME  to preside at the Conviction of  SEJANUS  as I think it adds much Spirit to the closing the Catastrophe I have drawn him of a Disposition much milder than he was in Reality The pious Resolution of repealing the Oppressions and healing the constitutional Wounds made by  SEJANUS  which I have put into his Mouth in the last Speech of the Play I thought necessary  to preserve  Poetical Justice  to which I think History should give Way for the real Use of dramatic Performances is to instil Virtue and raise an Abhorrence of Vice Example is a strong Argument nothing conduces so much to our Reformation as punishing the Wicked and rewarding the Virtuous 'tis then that the Moral is truly strong indeed the Guiltless must sometimes fall to heighten the Distress and impress us with a just Pity  If these Liberties should to the Critics appear Errors I honestly confess them Errors of my Judgment and for my Confession expect to be mildly treated By the Critics I would be understood to mean only the judicious not such teizing Insects such buzzing Drones of Society as those at present distinguish'd by that Name  Who fret and strut their Hour upon the Stage  And then are heard no more  SHAKESPEARE  Each Wight who reads not and but scans and spell  Each Wordcatcher that lives on Syllables  POPE  From such I neither wish or expect Indulgence let them be ridiculous at my Expence if they please my Pity they may move but not my Anger From the Penetration of the Judicious I shall be glad to meet Correction their Clemency I doubt not for still like the Brave they chuse rather to spare than destroy My  asserting that I had a  national Advantage in View  in this Subject may be thought chimerical at first but when the following Abstract from History of the Life of  SEJANUS  is considered what I have advanced may perhaps be allowed  AELIUS SEJANUS  the Son of  SEIUS STRABO  was born in  TUSCANY  He served when young with some Reputation under  CAIUS CAESAR  Nephew to  AUGUSTUS  and afterwards in the  Praetorian Band  under the Command of  TIBERIUS  to the various Turns of whose Disposition by conforming he gradually crept into his closest Secrets and was the first in his Esteem When  TIBERIUS  mounted the Imperial Throne he allowed this his favourite such an Extent of Power as rendered him the Terror of honest Men and the Idol of Sycophants The taking off  GERMANICUS  Husband to the  AGRIPPINA  who is introduced in this Play and Nephew to the Emperor a Prince remarkable for the greatest Virtues though the Odium of it was artfully flung on  GNEIUS PISO GERMANICUS  's Lieutenant was generally and justly attributed to him This was his first close Attack upon the  LIBERTY  of  ROME  and procured him the Hatred of the People After this by the Means of  LIVIA  Wife to  DRUSUS EUDEMUS  her Physician and  Lygdus  an Eunuch who was  SEJANUS  's  CATAMITE  he contrived and effected the Death of  DRUSUS  Son to  TIBERIUS  and Heir apparent to the Empire The  Reason assigned for his Hatred was a Blow which  DRUSUS  one Day gave him but his future Proceedings shewed Ambition not Revenge was the Motive which urg'd to the Deed for he had determin'd to remove every Bar which lay between him and the Throne This was but a Prelude to his future Villainies  AGRIPPINA  her Sons and all who were Friends to the  Family  of the dead  GERMANICUS  were next to be disposed of This was effected by representing them to  CAESAR  who was naturally of a  jealous  Disposition as aspiring and ambitious and consequently dangerous  CAIUS SILIUS  was first mark'd out for Sacrifice who being before the Senate criminated by  VARRO  the Consul and finding his Death had been premeditately resolved on by a voluntary Wound anticipated a public Execution  SABINUS  another Adherent to the Family of  GERMANICUS  was next taken off by the Means of  LATIARIS  his Relation and profess'd Friend who having often with much seeming Sincerity rail'd at the Oppressions and Tyranny of  SEJANUS  and thus by touching him  Ev'n on the tend'rest Point the Master String  Which  made  most Harmony or Discord in him  ROWE  Having wrought him up to join in his Invectives He fix'd two  Senators  who were  Creatures  to  SEJANUS  in a secret Place whence they might overhear the Discourse between  SABINUS  and him who on his too freely censuring the Conduct of  CAESAR  rush'd from their Ambush accused him of Treason and after a formal Process he was by Death eased of the Pains which he endured for the Sufferings of his Country  SEJANUS  next with the Concurrence of  TIBERIUS  removed  AGRIPPINA  and her  Sons  so that he had none now left to oppose his Interest with  CAESAR  or Designs upon the  Throne  Her he had banish'd to  PANDATERIA  an  Island  in the  TYRRHENE  Sea  NERO  to the Island of  PONTIA  near  NAPLES  and  DRUSUS  confined in the most abject Part of the Palace  Being thus successful in all his Schemes what he aimed at became more and more apparent To facilitate his Designs on the  EMPEROR  he endeavoured to demean him in the Opinion of the People by ridiculing his Defects and Imperfections on the  public Theatre  This first induced  CAESAR  to examine more nearly into his Conduct and he soon found it was absolutely necessary for his own Safety to hurl this  COLOSSUS  of the  ROMAN STATE  suddenly down the Steep of Fate To effect this appeared scarcely practicable since he feared the Fall of this stupendous Pile would drag down with it contiguous Ruin in which he himself might be involved However he at  last compassed this coveted end by the Assistance of  MACRO  and a Shew of encreasing Friendship and Trust which rendered  SEJANUS  still more secure when his Glory was on the Verge of expiring He was when even such an Attempt must have seem'd impossible accused by a Letter from  TIBERIUS  then in  CAPREA  supported by Proofs in full  Senate  of the most flagitious Crimes condemned with Ignominy and to the unexpected Joy and Surprize of every  honest Roman  precipitated from the topmost Height of  Fortune  to the lowest Depth of  Adversity  and a shameful Death It is generally and justly remarked that the  Sunshine  of Prosperity animates a Number of buzzing Flies who disappear with its  Decline  The Truth of this Observation was never more apparent than in the Case of  SEJANUS  for not one of the Number of  Sycophants  and  Dependants  who had been the Instruments of his villanies and who held large Fortunes and Titles from his Bounty offered to defend him at his Fall or even wore the Face of Concern nay so far from it they were his most sanguine Enemies and hurried him onward to his Fate  SEJANUS  seemed to have been mark'd out by Providence as an Example to Futurity of that Justice which will at one Time or other overtake the  Great bad Man  who uses his Power to oppress or to curtail the  Liberties  of his  Country  And were this his History  to be performed either publicly or privately for  ministerial Amusement  an excellent and persuasive Instruction must ensue from it  The same Soil which was blessed with a  BRUTUS  a  CATO  and a  GERMANICUS  was cursed with a  SEJANUS BRITAIN  who feels herself happy in an  ORRERY  a  CHESTERFIELD  and had in the Person of her late generally and justly lamented  PRINCE  of  WALES  all that  ROME  boasted in her  GERMANICUS  knows not what  SEJANUS  may rise in future Times to wound her Peace  Business detaining me in the Country I requested my Friend Mr  DERRICK  to present this Play to Mr  GARRICK  which he accordingly did and was promised by him an Answer in four or five Days Mr  DERRICK  waited on him again about that Time when with a  Punctuality  which is not at all answerable to the Character generally given of  theatrical Managers  he returned the Piece with some Compliments as to its Merits alledging that it had too much Declamation in it to succeed on the  Stage  and I am induced to believe that though this  Play  was not introduced to Mr  GARRICK  under any  particular prevailing Influence  he took the Trouble to peruse it and on that alone founded his Answer  However I suppose you expect to find me severe on the Manager for presuming to repulse my Offspring but you are mistaken I am ever ready to  receive  and thankful  for  Instruction It being an approved Maxim with me that  Approbation is very pleasing but Correction more profitable  and therefore say with  SHAKESPEARE  's  BRUTUS  though more in earnest  I shall be glad to learn of able Men  SHAKESPEARE  PROLOGUE  WHEN Vice corrupts and cankers in a State  It surely brings tho' slow the Frowns of Fate  When plodding Ministers by wicked Arts  Can blind the Eyes and rule a People's Hearts  Then Tyranny and Faction rage around  And lawless Acts eternally abound  The Nation groans beneath indignant Chains  Where proud ambitious Statesmen hold the Reins  Such was SEJANUS such he flourish'd long  For Patriot Opposition much too strong  By direst Means and Artifice he rose  And step'd tow'rds Empire on the Necks of Foes  No Honesty before his Pow'r could stand  Poor harass'd Virtue fled the suff'ring Land  Wounded she labour'd for a safe Retreat  And weeping Blood forsook her ancient Seat  While Vice in all the Pomp and Pow'r of Pride  Did at ROME's venerable State preside  Yet tho' thus deck'd with most alluring Charms  Who would not fly to banish'd Virtue's Arms  Titles like Bubbles that on Waters play  Are by a Breath both rais'd and puff'd away  'Tis Virtue that alone feels no Decay  She gives her Proselytes a lasting Store  Beyond the Worth of sordid glitt'ring Ore  Her Joys are of a higher nobler Bent  They balm the Mind administring Content  Thus much it necessary seem'd to say  Concerning the chief Purport of the Play  And now a second Charge I must fulfill  Our Author Alterer or what you will  Humbly requests the Critics may be still  Not that he fearsthe snarling Train he slights  For under JOHNSON's laurell'd Shade he writes  If you will damn he says his Fall is great  Since honest BEN must e'en participate  And so ally'd he dares the Frowns of Fate  DRAMATIS

Court of Vice is not our Sphere  We want the glossy Arts and thriving Use  Should make us share the Sunshine of this Place  Which is the Soil of Flatt'ry and Deceit  It is a Garden full of baneful Herbs  Known by the Names of Sycophants and Slaves  No  Roman  Spirit here could dwell at Ease  Among the busy Herd of Knaves and Fools  Sab  We have no Change of Faces no cleft Tongues  No soft and glutinous Bodies that can stick  Like Snails on painted Walls or on our Breasts  Creep up to fall from that proud Height to which  We did by Slavery not Service climb  We burn with no black Secrets that can make  Us dear to the pale Authors or live fear'd  Of their still waking Jealousy to raise  Ourselves a Fortune by subverting theirs  We stand not in the Lines that do advance  To that so

Smile and betray impeach the guiltless Man  Sell to their Suitors shallow grapling Fools  The empty Smoak that flies about the Palace  Laugh when their Patron laughs frown as he frowns  Change every Mood as often as he varies  Gods are these Men Suffer ye Slaves like these  To take your own great Likeness on themselves  And act such Baseness in a human Shape  Why are they not distinguish'd by a Form  Vile and abhorred as their treach'rous Souls  Then Honesty might seek a different Clime  Divided from these Proselytes of Hell  Sab  Nay so universal is the Malady  That all our  Consuls  and no

Deeds  Sili  Well we deserve it all nay and much more  Who with our Riots Pride and Civil Hate  Have so provok'd the Vengeance of the Gods  We who within these fourscore Years were born  Free equal

our Dreams  Or think but 'twill be TreasonWhere is now  The Soul which animated Godlike CATO  Who durst oppose when CAESAR dar'd do wrong  Or where the constant BRUTUS who being proof  Against the Charm of Benefits did strike  So brave a Blow into the Tyrant's Heart  That basely meant to captivate his Country  Those mighty Spirits now are fled the Light  And not a Spark of their eternal Fires  Glows in a present Bosom  Sab  It pains to think  How much beneath our Ancestors we fall  Who guarded sacred Virtue with their Lives  And dy'd with Honour or liv'd ever free  Sil  Oh good SABINUS let Remembrance cease  'Twere better be incapable to think  Than thro' Reflection to observe these Times  See the great Mistress of the World enslav'd  Oppress'd with Woes and harass'd out with Cares  While her abandon'd Sons quite lost to Fame  Who should her sacred Liberty defend  In Luxury and Riot spend their Time  Become the voluntary Tools of Pow'r  And work the Chains to manacle themselves

see it shall receive  A fit and full Reward for his large Merit  In gaining me the great SEJANUS Love  Which more than tributary Worlds I prize  Seja  Thou brightest Object of my panting Heart  Thou Joy and Source of ev'ry pleasing Thought  Not Glory Fame or ought on Earth to me  Can hold a Balance equal to thy Love  By Heav'n I ne'er knew Transport till this Hour  My Days have all been idly spent till now  Like one without the Use of precious Sight  Long have I stumbled thro' a gloomy Shade  But now thy Day breaks in upon my Soul  The Clouds disperse and all around is bright  Livi  How pleasing is the Sound of soothing Words  From the dear Object of one's tender Love  But will this ardent Passion ne'er expire  Can'st thou transgress the Rule of all thy Sex  So constant prove to keep thy promis'd Faith  Nor slight Possession of a doating Fool  Oh should'st thou negligently fly my Arms  Should in thy Breast the Flame of Love expire  Life would no longer then be worth my Care  Seja  Do not my Eyes unfold my inmost Thoughts  Do they not speak thee Empress of my Soul  Oh beauteous Princess whose transcendent Form  Strikes with Astonishment each wond'ring Eye  And like the SUN great Nature's Source of Life  Indulgent Beams to gladden all around  How dark is all when thou art from my Eyes  How tedious Time when thou art from my Arms  With thee he leaves his Instruments of Flight  Nor seems to move when uninspir'd by thee  Then if in Absence I do ever mourn  Nor taste of Comfort but when thou art nigh  Thou need'st not sure suspect declining Love  Livi  Think if I fear 'tis only for thy Sake  So much thou art the God of my Desires  So much the Joy and Comfort of my Life  So much the Object of my hourly Thoughts  That I would grudge ev'n Heav'n it's Part of thee  And have thee hail no other Shrine but Love  Seja  It is too much by all the Pow'rs I swear  Empires are poor to such Expence of Love  Nor can a Mortal the large Boon repay  Nay it would task the mighty Pow'r of Gods  To give a Blessing of an equal Worth  Livi  Had lov'd SEJANUS been my wedded Lord  Then had my Hours in Joys transporting pass'd  But cruel Fate ran counter to my Will  Join'd me to one who never shar'd my Heart  For it has ever waited upon thee  Seja  Why here thou speak'st the Malice of our Fate  Oh Gentle Love were but one Bar remov'd  The Road to perfect Happiness is plain  Livi  DRUSUS I know thou mean'st and much I wish  For thy dear Sake he now surviv'd no more  He is thy Enemy a deadly Foe  Yet more should he e'er note our secret Loves  What sure Destruction must that Period bring  Heav'ns how I tremble at the rising Thought  It strikes a Terror to my shiv'ring Heart  Seja  One Way there is quite open to Repose  If thou dost hold SEJANUS in thy Love  Nay if thy Life or Peace be worth thy Care  Thou wilt adventure what I shall propose  Thou hast the Pow'r the Means to fix our Peace  And bid Defiance to the Frowns of Fate  Livi  If I have Pow'r then Safety is our own  Seja  List then to what Precaution does advise  In DRUSUS' Death alone our Fears can end  EUDEMUS shall prepare a potent Draught  Which thou with Care must mix in DRUSUS Cup  'Twill give quick Passage to his fleeting Soul  And we shall taste uninterrupted Joys  Livi  Yet think a little I'm his wedded Wife  And tho' he stands not fix'd in my Esteem  I should not be the Minister of Fate  'Tis barbarous nay terrible to think  And makes my Blood run chilly thro' my Veins  Is there no gentler Means of Safety left  But must I perpetrate the horrid Act  Seja  Nature commands us to protect ourselves  Undaunted then th' important Task perform  Nor let such pallid Fears assail thy Breast  Think if once done 'twill fix thee safely mine  Livi  Thy Arguments o'er Nature have prevail'd  Nor will I live with Happiness in View  And thro' vain Fears reject the hop'd for Bliss  Fate shall not bar me from my Wish's Lord  So to preserve SEJANUS wholly mine  I will administer the fatal Draught  The Potion which EUDEMUS shall prepare  Seja  Thou bright and reigning Mistress of my Heart  So much thy Beauty had enflam'd my Soul  I thought no Pow'r could have enhanc'd my Zeal  But now I see your Readiness and Will  To execute the sure and only Means  Will fix thy future Happiness and mine  I own the Constancy inspires my Breast  And fires my Heart with yet more ardent Love  A Spirit so aspiring great as thine  Was ne'er created for an idle Second  To DRUSUS' languid Flame'twas form'd to shine  Bright as the Moon among the lesser Lights  And share the Sov'reignty of all the World  Then LIVIA triumphs in her proper Sphere  When she and her SEJANUS shall divide  The Name of CAESAR and AUGUSTA's Star  Be dim'd with Glory of a brighter Flame  When AGRIPPINA's Fires are quite extinct  And the scarce seen TIBERIUS borrows all  His Light from us whose folded Arms  Shall make one perfect Orb  Livi  My noble Lord  To fix our Safety calls for utmost Speed  Therefore we'll haste to banish anxious Fears  For since it must be done it should be soon  While now the total Softness of my Sex  Is fled far off on thy Persuasion's Wing  Farewell when next we meet expect with Joy to hear  That he who bars thy Way to Empire is no more  Then judge how far I venture for your Sake  Seja  This one embrace and then farewell my Love  Till that blest Hour that makes thee wholly mine  No perfect Joy can dwell within my Breast  Livi  I will but change your Words my Lord farewell  Exeunt LIVI and EUDEM  Sej  If this be not Revenge when it is done  And made quite perfect let AEGYPTIAN

But all in vain My ever waking Soul  Sits brooding o'er a Train of Images  That constant rise in terrible Array  And shrink my Resolution into Fears  But wherefore should vain Fancies thus appall  Is not an Empire subject to my Rule  Have I not all that Fortune could bestow  In ev'ry Thing but Name an Emperor  Is not Ambition glutted with my Store  And yet that faithful Mirror of the Mind  Reflection still a gloomy Prospect shews  Remorse the  Raven  of a guilty Mind  Is ever croaking horrid in my Ear  Often I rouse to banish it away  But the Tormentor still returns again  And like PROMETHES'  Vulture  ever gnaws  What then is Glory without soft Repose  If sweet Content is banish'd from my Soul  Life grows a Burden and a Weight of Woe  Oh that I could run o'er my Race again  Then would I chuse to tread the humble Vale  Nor lab'ring climb up Greatness painful Hill  But my past Deeds have set me beyond Cure  And I must still go on or worse endure  Assist me Furies with your hellish Aid  Nor let the Tyrant Conscience more invade  Since I am stain'd with Blood thro' Blood I'll wade  Enter EUDEMUS  Sej  Wherefore EUDEMUS are these earnest Looks  Eud  My Lord the Princess

DRUSUS' Shade appear'd last Night  And charg'd her all your Actions to reveal  As some Attonement for her guilty Life  Possess'd of this she flies o'er all the House  Crying aloud for Vengeance on SEJANUS  Sej  A Tongue whose Words are of such dire Import  Should not be suffer'd to have Motion free  She must be silenc'd or she ruins all  They shall be try'd and tho' I loath her Sight  So much Enjoyment has pall'd all Desire  Yet I will speak to her in raptur'd Phrase  If the dissembl'd Passion can prevail  No farther we'll proceedbut if it fails  Then our own Safety loudly claims her Death

invade thy hellish Heart  Or can the Fiends Projectors of thy Deeds  Afford thee Strength of Mind at all to smile  And brave the Justice of avenging Heav'n  Hark the murder'd DRUSUS calls upon thee  And groans for Vengeance from the Womb of Earth  Sej  Does LIVIA then upbraid the Act of Love  What but thy Beauty could provoke that Deed  For thee I would have sacrific'd the World  And with the

second Time thy easy Prey  I have already lost my Peace of Mind  Quick crowding Horrors compass me around  And Life is burthensome with cumbrous Pain  Reflection makes me curse my natal Hour  The hallow'd Womb of her who gave me Birth  The Pow'rs who have permitted me to live  The Day the Night the Race of human Kind  But chiefly thee who led me first astray  Sej  Thou could'st not stray and find such ardent Love  The Gods are envious of our perfect Bliss  Thinking it more than Mortals should possess  They mingle this Perplexity of Mind  To disconcert and bitter all our Joys  Liv  What Joys Do any Joys remain in Hell  Or what's the same a Croud of guilty Thoughts  Who can repose upon a Bed of Thorns  Yet that were Pleasures to the Pangs I feel  Envelop'd with Despair I wish to die

protract thy Life  Great CAESAR shall behold thy worthy Deeds  'Tis he shall thank thee for his murder'd Son  He shall behold thee in thy proper Light  Just as thou art the Serpent of his Blood  Sej  Stay yet a Moment lovely Princess stay  Why would you strive to ruin thus the Man  That knows no Blessing equal to thy Smiles  Nay on thy self bring dreadful Ruin down  For such must wait thy unadvised Tale  If thou can'st bid me die then Life farewell  For all is lost if I am lost to thee  Nor would I live to hear thee wish me dead  Were I convinc'd thy cooler Reason rul'd  But well I know the Fever of the Mind  This sudden Gust that irritates thy Soul  On calm Reflection will abate and cease  Go in my Love enjoy a short Repose  And lull thy ruffled Thoughts with healing Rest  I'll bring a Cordial shall compose thy Cares  And banish all Phantasmas from thy Brain  Liv  I guess the friendly Purpose of your Heart  And know the healing Balm you have prepar'd  It is a Med'cine I'd receive with Joy  If thou wer't not to triumph in my Fall  And longer live a Burden to the Earth  Think not thy Cobweb Arts shall now prevail  They are too flimsy to oppose my Rage  Heav'n is grown weary with thy num'rous Crimes  Which cry aloud and bellow for Revenge  The Arm of Fate now brandishes her Dart  That is to mark thy Body for the Grave  And hurl thy impious Soul to blackest Hell  Then since thy Reign is drawing near a Close  I will be foremost to compleat thy Fall  This to my injur'd Husband here I vow  Sej  It must be soI'll stab her treach'rous Heart  Her Death till proper Time may be conceal'd  Aside  Since then relentless Rage thus rules thy Breast  And thy SEJANUS must a Victim fall  Give one Embrace to comfort him in Death  When thou shalt see me in my dying Pangs  Drop but one Tear in Pity to my Fate  And that will smooth her most tormenting Frowns  Liv  If ev'ry Joy were only in my Gift  I would disperse them among common Slaves  And lavish them on ev'ry abject Wretch  E'er give a Grain of Happiness to thee  Therefore expect the dread Approach of Fate  When thou wilt curse thy horrid Crimes too late  When thou shalt be expos'd to public Shame  And hear the Rabble Crowds revile thy Name  Blasted by me thou shalt fall headlong down  And Tortures meet for an imperial Crown  All thy ambitious Hopes in Death shall end  Without the Comfort of one pitying Friend  As thou hast ever labour'd to enthral  And hated liv'd despis'd by Slaves thou'lt fall  With Rapture all must view thee Gasp in Death  And bless the Moment of thy parting Breath  Sej

Gho  I am the murder'd DRUSUS' vengeful Shade  By thy vile Plots to sudden Death betray'd  Tremble to hear the Hour is drawing nigh  Wherein thou wilt bereft of Greatness die  Thy Titles Pomp and Heaps of sordid Gain  Will then be found most transitory vain  Nor give thee aught but everlasting Pain  Like an illfounded Fabrick shalt thou fall  And with Fate struggling may'st for Mercy call  But no one God will take the smallest Care  To ease the racking Torments of Despair  A guilty Mind shall pain thy latest Hour  And Conscience all thy future Peace devour  When down the Precipice of Fate

Love  Var  His Lordship comesroom for the great SEJANUS  Enter SEJANUS AFER and LATIARIS c  Arr  Now LEPIDUS behold the servile Crew  How Spaniellike they cringe and fawn and bow  Aside  Sej  Health to great CAESAR and the State of ROME  Tib  That to preserve are we assembled here  And tho' perhaps not plain to public View  Yet Rev'rend fathers 'tis endanger'd much  Such hellish Practices are hourly wrought  As to be told will strike ye with Surprize  The wife SEJANUS can unfold them all  Speak then our dearest Counsellor and Friend  Of what you know concerns the ROMAN State  Nor fear to pain in probing of our Wounds  I know thy tender and relenting Heart  Feels utmost Pangs for such abhorred Crimes  But yet would smooth th' Offences of my Blood  Nor give true Colour to my Kinsmen's Guilt  Lest it should fix a Stain upon my Name  But as thou hold'st thy Prince and Country dear  Speak ev'n thy Fears without the least Disguise  Sej  To be thus honour'd by my sov'reign Lord  To have such Confidence repos'd in me  Is more than all my Services can claim  But what I can I will with Duty pay  Since I must speak yet would 'twere not my Task  In AGRIPPINA all our Dangers lurk  She madly thirsting for Imperial Sway  Doth hourly plot among conspiring Friends  To place her darling Son upon the Throne  New mould and overturn the present State  With specious Promises fallacious Tears  Many she gains to her rebellious Ends  Such discontented and repining Slaves  As hope by Revolution to amend  Already some have suffer'd for the Cause  As SILIUS and SABINUSmore remain  Which as they merit will I hope be us'd  Tib  I hope so too and shall if I have Pow'r  Var  My Lord SEJANUS shall determine all  His Voice shall crush these Cankers of the State  Afe  He is a worthy and right noble Lord  Lat  Determinate and just in his Decrees  Arr  Hark the Court Birds now all in Chorus join  SEJANUS whistles and they learn the Tune  Aside  Sej  Most Reverend Fathers for my single self  I could be most content with private Life  Abstracted from the Turmoils of the State  Peaceful Retirement best would suit my Mind  But for my Emperor's and your lov'd Sakes  What Pains what Perils would I not endure  I have not sought the Honours I enjoy  Nor yet impress'd by interested Views  My weak Ambition never soar'd more high  Than to approve me loyal to my Prince  And still industrious for my Country's Good  These were the Principles I still preserv'd  While overflowing Bounties paid my Deeds  Afe  They have been all deserv'd and many more  Fathers let's build a Temple to his Fame  He is the great Protector of our State  And therefore should be rank'd amongst the Gods  Var  AFER well mov'dthe Senate will approve  Tib  Fathers forbear ye know not what ye do  The swelling Tide of unrestrain'd Success  Has flow'd so high as near to break its Bounds  And Deluge in Destruction o'er the State  I will remove the Blind which stands before  And stops the Penetration of your Sight  Shew you this Traytor 'circled round with Guilt  Whom I have rais'd upon the Wing of Hope  More to torment him with the Shock of Fate  Which like the unseen Thunderbolt now falls  To crush this Heap of Villainy to Earth  Behold this Slave as Serpent to my Breast  He is the VULTURE would devour us all  Omnes  How's this SEJANUS  Tib  Ay that very Slave  Whom I have nurs'd and foster'd with my Blood  Whom rais'd to highest Honour and Renown  Fathers ye all seem much amaz'dhe looks surpriz'd  As if that Guilt were foreign to his Soul  Dissimulation shall not save thee now  Where is my Son thou Traitor turn'st thou pale  What Fate will your grave Wisdoms here decree  To him who robb'd my noble Son of Life  Sej  With sudden Accusation thus surpriz'd  I know not what to answer to my Prince  'Tis hard that Supposition should condemn  And blast my faithful Services at once  May I not hope so much your Highness' Grace  As Time of Preparation for Defence  Tib  Too well I know thee to let Favour smile  Or give thee Opportunity to 'scape  Thou would'st have Time t' alarm the servile Herd  Which by the Pow'r I gave thou hast obtain'd  As slavish Sycophants to aid thy Cause  I have ta'en Care to seize thee unprepar'd  And by our awful CAPITOL I swear  Thou shalt meet Fate before an Hour's Space  If any here oppose the just Decree  He shall be deem'd a Traitor and my Foe  Sej  Will then great CAESAR sentence me to Death  And criminate without an Evidence  Tib  To strike him dumb bring that EUDEMUS forth  Var  This is most wonderful  Afe  Beyond all Belief  Arr  Now LEPIDUS behold the Courtier fry  How prone they are how liable to change  Enter EUDEMUS  Tib  This was the Slave by thee suborn'd to act  This was the  Pandar  of thy Hellish Schemes  Who now repenting has confess'd it all  In Hopes to gain a Pardon from the State  For shewing the Distemper of our Blood  And bringing Justice on thy wicked Head  Aside  Sej  Nay then I am undoneThis is no Proof  Brib'd by my Enemies he will say aught  Those Enemies I made by serving you  Eud  Most grave and reverend Senators of ROME  For strictest Justice in your Councils fam'd  You see me here a most unhappy Wretch  Stung with Remorse abhorring my own Guilt  Of basely joining in such wicked Acts  As this SEJANUS won me to perform  Great DRUSUS fell by our complotted Schemes  And I've for ever lost my Peace of Mind  Sej  And will a Tale form'd by an artful Slave  Without Foundation and devoid of Truth  So sway where awful Justice should preside  As to assail my Life and rule my Fate  Tib  Can'st thou so bravely then deny the Fact  Var  The Guilt is plainly pictur'd in his Look  Lat  He is a Monster fraught with foul Deceit  Arr  Oh do the Birds begin to change their Notes  Aside  Eud  Since he has Confidence to brave his Guilt  And to arraign the Justice of the Court  Fathers but send a Messenger with me  I will produce an Object shall declare  And speak so loud in Proof of his Misdeeds  Evasion will no longer find a Plea  Tib  Say what thou can'st produce  Eud  Most mighty CAESAR  The faithless LIVIA our lost Prince's Wife  Betray'd by him to Infamy and Shame  Now lies expiring by his murderous Hands  Lest she should all his Villainies reveal  Tib  Go thou ARRUNTIUS prove the Truth of this  Sej  Then Fate conspires against me and I must fall  This Trouble spare I now confess it all  And think it is but just Guilt should be found  That took no better Care to silence bab'ling Tongues  Tib  Art thou not terrify'd abandon'd Wretch  To think what Tortures wait upon thy Crimes  Henceforth no Trust be held 'twixt Man and Man  Since he whom I still labour'd to promote  Rais'd from Obscurity to mate with Kings  Could use that Pow'r unto such wicked Ends  Had'st thou no grateful Feeling of my Love  Wretch whence could all thy Villainies derive  Sej  Since they are found what Matter whence they sprung  But if thou wilt be told know from Ambition  Your Folly rais'd me to such glaring Height  As made me hope to step into a Throne  And my Thoughts soar'd to universal Sway  Which I had nearly brought within my Grasp  Now the gay Dream is vanish'd from my Sight  The Clouds of Fortune to the Glare succeed  Yet I complain nothad I been a King  Death must one Day have seiz'd upon my Crown  But come ye thirsty Bloodhounds of the State  I see ye long to lap my vital Stream  Dispatch then and at once my Fate decree  Var  Let him be stripp'd of all his Honours first  Afe  His Images disrob'd and strait defac'd  Lat  Most bloody Villain  Sat  Most abandon'd Traitor  Var  Then let him be led forth to publick Death  Afe  Such as his Crimes deserve  Lat  To the most shameful  Nat  Aye and cruel  Sej  Right ye timeserving Sycophants and Slaves  But now ye were dependant on my Nod  Bask'd in my Looks and dwelt upon my Smiles  Nay strove with Emulation how to raise  Such Trophies as might eternize my Name  Now with full Cry ye run me to a bay  And snarling strive who takes the foremost Bite  Nor would TIBERIUS meet a better Fate  Were he but once within your currish Fangs  Ye all are just and wise to publick View  While Villainy lies lurking in your Hearts  Ye are my Judges who were once my Slaves  Base veering Weathercocks of ev'ry Blast  Who have not Stedfastness to brave a Gale  But on the Centers of your Interest turn  Your rotten Hearts still float with Fortune's Tide  But never dare run counter to the Stream  Which of ye all when I had Pow'r to serve  And feed with Bribes your avaritious Souls  But would with Pleasure have obey'd Command  Nor ever felt a conscientious Qualm  It is a Comfort at the Close of Life  That with my Life such Reptiles I forsake  Thus then I take my everlasting Leave  May all your Tongues as ye together cry  Together rot and in Oblivion lie  All Plagues that Heav'n can send to human Kind  All Pangs of Body and all Racks of Mind  With Jars intestine Discontents and Strife  Be your Tormenters thro' each Scene of Life  May Tyranny and Blood o'erwhelm ye all  And may ye like the curs'd SEJANUS fall  Exit  Tib  O Miracle of Villainy confess'd  Audacious and abandon'd to the last  Fathers break up the Senate for Today  Tomorrow we'll assemble here again  To heal those Wounds by base SEJANUS made  To free my Nephews AGRIPPINA's Sons  And all whose Virtues have of late been press'd  Beneath the Pow'r of this tyrannic Slave  Thus thro' Reflection's Mirror we may view  What dire Effects from lawless Acts ensue  Heav'n for some Space may suffer Vice to reign  But her Foundation cannot long remain  When once the Gods their awful Pow'r assume  She meets a certain and a horrid Doom  The solid Bliss which never feels Decay  Can only flourish warm'd by  Virtue's  Ray  FINIS
