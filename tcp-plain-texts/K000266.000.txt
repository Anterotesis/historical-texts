 THE Dyet of  POLAND  A SATYR CONSIDER'D  Paragraph  by  Paragraph  To which is added A  Key  to the whole with the Names of the  Author  and the  Nobility  and  Gentry  that are Scandalously Pointed at in it  Rode Caper vitem tamen hinc cum stabis ad Aras  In tua quod fundi Cornua possit erit  Ovid  LONDON  Printed And Sold by  Ben Bragg  at the  BlueBall  in  AveMaryLane  in the Year  THE PREFACE  AS  Poland  lyes almost in the same Latitude with  England  so the Character the Poet has here given of the  Poles  seems so exactly to match what some illnatur'd People have said of some in  Enland  that he easily foresees this Censorious Age will be apt to misjudge him as if he had some Oblique Meaning and that this was a  Satyr  levell'd at some People nearer Home  han the Castle of  Warsaw  To foresee an Accident and not endeavour to be prepar'd against it is a Piece of Policy peculiar to an Author that sets up  To Reform the Errors  of  Petty Statsmen  three times a week to no Purpose and it adds very much to a Malefactor's Conviction to be guilty of a Willful Crime Wherefore He had better either to have kept his  Foresight  to himself or stifled his  Poem  before he had sent it abroad to the Great Abuse of  imself and the Patriots he has taken the Freedom to Characte  As for his Skill in Poetry if it was no better than his Knowledge in Geography He might have spar'd the Trouble of a  Preface to the Reader  since there is so great a Difference between  London  and  Warsaw  in their Latitude that  he first is  Lon Lat  the last  Lon Lat  But the Author humbly hopes all such  InuendoMen  will consider that as they can have no Reason to Think so but  Similitude  of Characters so no Conjectures of theirs ought to prejudge his meaning in which he demands to be left to himself and expects to be understood in the following Poem as he  Speaks  not as every prejudic'd Man may imagine he  meant  How any Man can  humbly hope  that has the Arrogance to say He can be charg'd with nothing but similitude of Characters is beyoud the  Reach  of my Ʋnderstanding and if he has not done by the Gentlemen whom he has Injuriously treated as well as those whose Reputation is blasted with his Commendation as if he had actually written down their Christian and Sir Names in Capital Letters then I have no claim to any such Thing as Common Apprehension  If any are so Weak to tell us That  Smithfield  and  Cheapside  cannot be meant of  Poland  the Author presumes to ask such People if ever they have been at  Warsaw  and if they have and don't know that there is both a  Smithfield  and a  Cheapside  as well as a  MayFair  and a  BearGarden  he is sorry for their Heads and desires them to step thither again to Reform their Memories  Poland  may have Places put to the same uses as  Smithfield  and  Cheapside  and Fairs and Beargardens may be in Request there but it is none of his business to bring  English  Transactions upon the  Polish  Theatre And any Man of Compassion has very great Reason to be sorry for  his Head  who thinks to conceal what was Printed near  BartholomewClose  under the sorry Artifice of an Impression from  Dantzick  But suppose there are not places call'd directly by those Names if there are places apply'd to the same Uses what has any Body to question the Allegories A poor Author must never Write at all if he is not at Liberty to chose His  Metaphors  and all the rest of the necessary Figures of Speech to help out his Expression  He has forgot his Tryal at the  OldBaily  for writing  The Shortest Way with the Dissenters  or He would never insist upon an Author's Liberty to chuse what Metaphors He thinks fit for though He did not pay so dearly for his Beloved  Ironies  as he deserv'd yet the Sentence then pass'd on Him by the  Bench  might have had such an Effect upon his Temper as not to make him  uneasie  but when he was  breaking through  the Bonds he was engag'd in to the Government in being tyed up to his Good Behaviour  If 'tis alledg'd that there is too great an Affinity in the StoryHe Answers If that be True he is sorry for it but at the same time he Hopes not and the matter of Fact ought to be prov'd before he stands Censur'd for Calumny  Though the Character of the Persons his Satyr points at are False and Malicious yet they bear so near a Resemblance to what is said of them by their Enemies of the  Dissenting Party  that the Scandal is fix'd beyond an Excuse and ought to be Ammadverted upon with the utmost severity unless the Gentlemen in Power close with the Libeller and fling off all Deference and Respect for the Memories of their Predecessors  'Tis very hard that a Man cannot Write of the Follies of other Nations but People will be always comparing them with their own One would ha' Thought the Author had Travell'd far enough to find out Histories and odd Passages to divert us but if neither  China Poland  nor the Inhabitants of the  Moon  will protect Folks from being Hang'd as the  Frenchmen  said  for Tinking  go on Gentlemen and if the  Cap  fits any Body let 'em wear it You are Welcome to say these  Polish  Grandees represent  Englishmen  but look to it  ye Sons of Censure  that can Swear to a Man's Meaning and know his Inside without the help of his Outside For if the People your Profoundity  pretends to describe are Affronted the Action of Slander lyes against You and not the Anthor In the Writing 'tis a Poem you in the Reading turn it into a Libel and you merit the Punishment for the Metamorphosis  An ingennous Confession of the Author who would be thought to take the Pains of Concealing himself  If neither  China Poland  nor the Inhabitants of the Moon will protect Folks from being Hang'd  c Your Humble Servant Mr  Daniel Foe  you might as well have given us your Name at Large for every one knows who wrote the  Consolidator  and as to your  Meaning  they must be Men of profound Stupidity indeed that cannot find it out by your Gaping you are so Intelligible your self amongst your want of understanding So that the Scandal will be laid at your Door who made it a  Libel  not at your Readers who finds it as such  Perhaps there is a sort of Affinity among the Vitious part of Mankind in all Countries and Climates and the Author Doubts not he should have run the same Risque of Misconstruction had he Wrote this at  Paris  as at  London  that he should have been summon'd before the Court  of Honour  for Libelling the Princes  of the Blood  the  Sorbonne  or the  Councellors of Parliament  'tis very hard it should  there and here too  Had such a Piece of Scurrility dar'd to show its Face at  Paris  the Author of it would scarce have had his Heels at  during Life and if some People whom it concerns  of this nature would but perform those Duties  to the Well being of the Government He may chance to meet with none of the Civilest Treatment in  London  for his Impudence since no Term can be too opprobri  thinks no Appellation Bitter enough against  Direct  rs of the Publ  k Affairs who act contrary to the Methods  prescribe to them  Since then this is the Fate of Authors and he must expect it he Submits but desires however that these Unchristian Censurers will take this along with them and so make a Vertue of their want of Charity That whereever the Similitude of Character pinches them too close they would prevent the Severity of the Application by Reforming the Likeness the Satyr wou'd then have the desired Effect  viz  By drawing the Imaginary Picture of Outlandish Devels really Transform our own  The Fate of an Author that casts such a Reproach on the Church and Government Establish'd ought not to terminate in a  Scotch Casement  but He that has offer'd up a  Hymn  to the Pillory and made it clap its wooden Wings for Joy at the Reception of its new Tenant would not be much lamented if the Three Leg'd Tree a Mile and a half out of Town should pay Him the same Compliment Since it is not his Reader's  want  of Charity but his own that renders him Criminal  Nor do I apprehend the World will be less Solicitous about who is the Author of this Some perhaps will guess one some another and the  Hawkers  they tell me will according to Custom Cry it about the street in the famous Name of  Daniell de Foe  And tho' they might as well Guess it was Wrote by the Man in the  Moon  yet I am content He or any body else should go away with the Credit of it 'Tis enough that I am out of the Reach of the  Polish  Resentments and cannot be Prosecuted by the  Cardinal  Primate most of the Persons here toucht at being his Friends and all of them in his Interest and as for the World they may do their Worst  I am their Ʋnconcerned Humble Servant  Anglipoloski  Of Luthuania  When an Outrage is committed it is but natural to be in Quest of the Person that caus'd it and it will not be difficult  without the assistance of the Hawkers  who are more at his Service than his  Handmaids  the  Nine Muses  to find that this Label is not without sufficient Grounds for so doing charg'd with a Name those Prophane Throats are incessantly piercing our Ears with Which may prove his  being out of the Reach of the  Polish  Resentments  to be a more Chimara and false suggestion for though the Ecclesiastical Authority may not take him to Task He may be grinded to Powder by the Secular Arm which he must own himself obnoxious to notwithstanding his Borrow'd Name of  Anglipoloski  THE Dyet of  Poland  A SATYR  c  IN Northern Climes where furious Tempests blow  And Men more furious raise worse Storms below  At Nature's Elbow distant and remote  Happy for  Europe  had she been forgot  The World's  Proboscis  near the Globe's Extremes  For barb'rous Menrenown'd and barb'rous Names  There  Poland  lies too much her Maker's Care  And shares the mod'rate Blessings of the Air  Just as far off from Heaven as we are here  Those must be Furious Men indeed that can outBluster  Boreas  and how any thing can be at  Natures Elbow  and yet  Distant  and  Remote  at the same time requires the Nicest Determination Natures  Backside  would have done as well every Jot but it's a  Paw Word  as the Observator tells his Countryman  Roger  and must be flung aside for being Uncourtly The  World's Proboscis  too is altogether New and just minted why not  Great Toe  as well for he that gave the World a Nose gave it likewise Feet to Stand upon or it's Creation would be imperfect  Under the Artick Circle of the Sky  Where Vertues Streams run Low and Nature's High  For Heat of Clime too far of Blood too nigh  Temper'd for Plenty plenteously supply'd  With Men advanc'd in ev'ry Grace  but Pride  A mighty Nation throngs the groaning Land  Rude as the Climate num'rous as the Sand  Uncommon monstrous  Vertues  they possess  Strange odd prepostrous  Polish  Qualities  Mysterious Contraties they reconcile  The  Pleasing Frown  and the  Destroying Smile  Precisely gay and most absurdly grave  Most  humbly high  and  barbarously brave  Debauch'dly Civil  and  Prophanely Good  And fill'd with  Gen'rous  brave  Ingratitude  By  Boun  y Disoblig'd  by  Hatred won  Bold in their Danger Cowards when 'tis gone  To their own Ruin they're the only Tools  Wary of Knaves and easily chous'd by Fools  Profoundly empty  yet  declar'dly wise  And fond of blind Impossibilities  Swess d with Conceit  they boast of all they do  First praise themselves than think that Praise their Due  So fond of flatt'ring Words so vain in Pride  The World  Mock's  them and they the World  Deride  Value themselves upon their Nations Merit  In Spight of all the Vices they inherit  So wedded to the Country where they dwell  They think that's Heav'n and all the World s a Hell  Their frozen  Vistula  they'd not forgo  For fruitful  Danube  or the flow'ry  Po  Rapid  Boristhenes  delights them more  Than pearly Streams or a  Peruvian  Shore  And  Russian Dwina  dwells upon their Song  Hurried by barb'rous Steeps and Hills and pusht along  He must be well Read in Natural Philosophy that makes  Natures Streams  run higher Northwardly and in the Coldest Climates th  n in those that are many Degrees nearer to the Sun as the Western Parts  c  And since He has given Nature an  Elbow  does very  Poetically  as well as  Modestly  in describing Her  more Virginum  to make Water by the means of that Instrument for it is not to be imagin'd whence Her Streams Issue unless from thence That  Pride  is a  Grace  is likewise Wonderfully Novel and how they can  want  that  Grace  when in the same Paragraph they are  Swell'd with Conceit  and be  va  in Pride  is a Riddle requires an  Oedipus  to explain it Neither are the two last Lines the most sensible Mr  Foe  has written in his Life though they are very Musical to the Ear for it's a Manifest Contradiction to make the  Dwina dwell upon their Song  which is an Act of Stagnation at the same Time it is  Hurried i e Precipitated and push'd along by Barbarous Steeps and Hills  The Land too happy would the People bless  Could they agree to know their Happiness  Nature with very liberal Hand supplies  Her SituationInsufficiencies  The temperate Influence revolves of Course  And Spite of Climate Nature works by Force  The bounteous Spring the Winters Wast repairs  And make the World grow young in spight of Years  The fruitful Earth uncommon Freedom shows  And foreign Wealth by foreign Commerce flows  Now Dame Nature makes use of Her  Hand  as well as her  Elbow  and gives amends for Her  Situation Insufficiencies  But how  so  The  Climate was Temper'd for Plenty  in the Second Paragraph and now its so far from it that Nature is forc'd to Interpose and Act as we do  Unnaturaly  by Forcing the Growth of Plants  c  by Hot Beds For my Part it never Enter'd into my Noddle how  Nature  could work by  Force  till this Author gave it me in the Affirmative  But Peopl'd with a hard'ned Thankless Race  Whose Crimes add Horror to the milder Place  The Bounties by indulgent Heav'n bestow'd  Corrode the Mischief and debauch the Blood  That Native Fierceness which in Christian Lands  Makes Heroes and their Poets Praise commands  Here is a Vice which rankles up to  Fewd  And nourishes the Gust of vile Ingratitude  Pride Plenty's Handmaid deeply taints their Blood  And Seeds of Faction mix the Crimson Flood  Eternal Discords brood upon the Soil  And universal Strifes the State embroil  In every Family the Temper reigns  In every Action Seed of Gall remains  The very Laws of Peace create Dispute  And makes them quarrel who shall execute  Their valu'd Constitutions are so lame  That Governing they Governments inflame  Wild Aristocracy torments the State  And People their own Miseries create  To  Corrode a Mischief  is in my Sense to lessen it which is far from having any Analogy to  Debauching the Blood  that is to encrease it and then again to say that Native Fierceness which makes Heroes and Poets in Christian Countries here tis a Vice and Rankles up to Few'd is false Grammar with Reverence to his Dictatorship who sets up for the Difficult Resolver and impropriety Fi  der among the Class of Authors Besides my Historians tell me though they are not of  the Leyden Edition and Printed cum Notis Variorum  That  Poland  is a  Christian  Country which He seems not to allow here  In vain has Heav'n its choicer Gifts bestow'd  And strives in vain to do  a Willful  Nation Good  Such is the Peoples Folly such their Fate  As all Decrees of Peace anticipate  Immortal Jarrs in ev'ry Class appear  Conceiv'd in Strife and Nurs'd to Civil War  To make  Heaven strive in Vain  looks also a little Impious in an Author of this Gentleman's Pretences to Religion and to let it be  Anticipated in its Decrees of Peace  can fall under no other Apellation than that of Blasphemy  Such  Poland  is thy People such thy Name  Yet still thy Sons our Panegyricks claim  Because their partial Genius is inclin'd  To think they merit more than all Mankind  That is such is thy People  Poland  and such thy Name  i e Poland  And what of all this where's the harm of  Poland's  being call'd  Poland  A Spade's a Spade and a Bandbox will be a Bandbox to the end of the Chapter yet still they Love Praise and who does not As the ViceChancellor who anfwer'd a Master of Arts that gave in for his Reasons of denying a certain Scholar his Degree that  He Lov'd a Girl  by the known Response of  Quis non  What Man is without a Natural Affection to a Pritty Females  Imaginary Happiness will do  For near as many Uses as the true  And if the  Poles  in their own Plagues delight  Wise Heaven's too just to let them thrive in Spight  His Philosophy is none of the Best whatever the Cadence of his Poetry is for that Imaginary Happiness can serve for near as many uses as True neither  Aristotle  or  des Cartes  has yet laid down for an Axiom in Ethicks  Great  Sobieski  had their Crown obtain'd  With steady Glory thirthen Years he Reign'd  And none  but who some Mischief meant  complain'd  His Conqu'ring Sword made all Men think it fit  That he who sav'd the Land should Govern it  The Field of Battle he had first possest  By Sixty Thousand slaughter'd  Turks  confest  The fatten'd Frontiers felt the reeking Flood  And dy'd the Soil with  Asiatick  Blood  The weeping  Neister  half the Host receives  Hurries them down to darker  Euxine  Graves  And  Mahomet  's insulting Banners lay  Beneath the Cross his Valour's easie Prey  Now he begins to fall into Particulars and by Great  Sobieski  must be meant  K W  who Reign'd over us Thirteen Years and who Conquer'd  Ireland  in Person and by his Generals after the Loss of Sixty Thousand  French  and  Irish  that sided with the Unfortunate King  James  With mild and gentle but with steady Hand  He rather led than rul'd th' uneasie Land  Fill'd with Important Cares he saw their Fate  And all the growing Mischiefs their own Feuds create  Which made him less repine and less deplore  To quit the Crown with such Concern he wore  He rather Led than Rul'd  Very pritty truly and Emphaticaly That is He seem'd rather a Captain than a King  Dux suit non Rex  As if Leading an Army was not to Rule it  Tell us ye Sons of Policy and Fraud  Whose vast Intrigues your selves alone applaud  Who always plot too deep and soar too high  And Damn the Nations Peace you know not why  What ail'd the  Poles  with Peace and Plenty blest  To change for Years of Blood their Days of Rest  Describe the Men of Avarice and Pride  With all Ambition's dark Disguise array'd  How for the Nation's Liberty they Cant  Till those  they say abuse it  they supplant  And then the mock pretended Sham lay by  Pleas'd with the Profits of Authority  He might have spar'd himself the Question of  what ail'd the Poles c  when if he would but have look'd into the Partition Treaty which was Sign'd and brought about by a Minister of State He now professes so great a Regard for he had been satisfied without an Enquiry and if he would fasten upon any one of the Country Party for taking of Places after they had rail'd at Men in Offices we can give him two of the Cside  c  for one without any more to do by way of Exchange If D and H are sufficient to ballance Accounts with him  Statesmen are Gamesters Sharp and Trick's the Play  Kings are but Cullies wheedl'd in to Pay  The Courtiers Footballs kick'd from one to one  Are always Cheated oftentimes Undone  Besieg'd with Flatt'ry false Report and Lies  And sooth'd with Schemes of vast Absurdities  The jangling Statesmen clash in their Designs  Fraud fights with Fraud and Craft to Craft inclines  Stifly engage quarrel accuse and hate  And strive  for leave  to help undo the Sate  For all the strong Contention ends in this  Who shall  the Pow'r of doing Ill  possess  Envy and Strife are only rais'd so high  Because a Man's a greater Knave than I  But if I can his Place and Wealth succeed  He rails of Course and I'm the Knave indeed  Places and Pensions are the  Polish  Spoil  Will all sides please and all sides reconcile  'Tis natural to all the Sons of Men  To  Rail  and  Plot  when out be  Quiet  in  If all the Strife and Contention for Offices and Places of Trust be for obtaining the  Power of doing Ill  then those in Authority must of Consequence  do Ill  Which is but an odd Compliment to the Present Administration and takes off very much from the Character he bestow's upon the  L H T  and Mr  Sty Hy  under the Names of  Casimir  and the  Dyets Marshall  And if Kings are  Cully's FootBalls  and  Wheedled into Pay  he has done  Augustus  no Manner of Service in giving him that Inglorious Title And here I cannot agree with some People who will have  Augustus  to be the Type of  Q A  for an Author could not be so unmannerly as to Represent a Fortunate Princess and Immoveable in Her Principles by the Name of one who has not only Chang'd his Religion for a Crown but has Ruin'd his Hereditary Dominions being as it were under a State of Exile at this Juncture But Authors are Inscrutable in their Reasons and I leave him to explain himself on this Head to such as he shall think fit to Impart the Secret to  Long had Divided  Poland  felt the Smart  Of vast Intrigues and Politicians Art  As many Men of Character and Blood  So many Thieves about the Scepter stood  As many Gifts th' Exhausted Prince could give  So many Friends he only seem'd to have  The craving Wretches hung about the Throne  He gave them all the Nation's Wealth and all his own  That  There were Thieves about the Throne  in the Late Reign we'll not dispute but he that has been so Free with the Names of such as have shar'd in the Direction of Publick Affairs in this might have given us theirs had they not been his particular Friends and Favoureits I never heard the Prince he reflects upon gave away all his Wealth to these  Craving Wretches  if he had there had been no Dispute between the King of  Prussia  and Prince of  Friez land  about the Immense Riches he left behind Him  Not all the Conquer'd Lands the  Turk  resign'd  Not all the World had he the World obtain'd  Wou'd their insatiate Avarice suffice  Supply their Hands or satisfie their Eyes  Who shall unhappy sinking  Poland  save  What Gifts can close the Hands that always crave  Unsatisfi'd as Death and greedy as the Grave  At every just Refusal Discontent  And rave  for want of Bribes  at Government  The  Turk  that is K  J  who  Abdicated  What a Respectful Title does he give Her Majesty's Royal Father and  suffice their Avarice  is a Peculiarity of Phrase I never heard of before But this I have to say for him when he turns Plagiary he makes bold with his own Works as thinking nothing that belongs to others worthy of being taken from them but their Reputations Witness  Unsatisfied as Death and Greedy as the Grave  which are applyed to the  Saints  Favourite Sir  R Clton  in his Satyr call'd the Reformation  The valiant  Sobieski  had bestow'd  Moldavian  Lands he conquer'd by his Sword  He thought it just  that Province  to bestow  On those whose Valour helpt to make it so  But all the wiser Men who had no Share  Against the Justice of the Gift declare  Oblige the yielding Hero to recant  And rebestow the hasty envy'd Grant  By  Moldavia  is meant  Ireland  and if the Members of Parliament whom he owns to be the  Wiser  pass'd an Act for resuming the Grants of the forfeited Estates in that Kingdom then he must allow himself to be false in his Character when he speaks of them in another Style sometime after And if the Grant was allow'd to be Hastily they are not to be blam'd who considerately press'd His Late Majesty to  Rebestow  it on the Publick  But tell us now ye Men of  Polish  Wit  How the  Moldavian  feels the formal Cheat  Let  Aleski  reimburse the Bribes  Ravisht to wrong instate the  Polish  Tribes  Let all the sham Conveyances appear  The Phantosme Sales and Fancy'd Purchaser  Let some true Satyr all the Grievance lash  Lands without Title Buyers without Cash  Under the weighty Fraud  Moldavia  bleeds  And private Cheat the publick Cheat succeeds  Retrieving Laws by vast Designs Push'd on  Cover Great  Sobieski  's Errors by their own  Here he takes Matters upon Trust by giving Credit to a few  Irish  Petitions For the Parliament if he means the Proceedings of the Trustees for the Forfeited Estates since  Aleski i e  Mr  Annesly  was one in that Commission have pass'd a Vote in their Favour which is a sufficient Argument that they  not Part with the Lands they were Impowr'd to sell to the Buyer without Cash  With all these Frauds and Feuds and Millions more  Which rack'd the injur'd  Poles  and kept them poor  Wife  Sobieski  with strong Cares opprest  Dismiss'd the Throne  and chose to be at Rest  Embroil'd he left them whom embroil'd he found  And great  Augustus  with his Pow'r's Enthron'd  Dismiss'd the Throne  may be an elegancy with him but cannot with a Judicious Reader who will Conclude Death Dismiss'd K  W  from the Throne neither is it a very great Compliment to a King's Memory whom he would play the  Panegyrist  upon to affirm that he  left us Embroil'd  since the World is not without People who make very Odd Reflections upon his  Last Will and Testament  In vain the new Crown'd Monarch strives to please  Or Cure th' Hereditary vile Disease  In vain Confed'rates with the Nations Friends  In vain their Laws and Freedom he defends  The Parties joyn in Grand Cabals they meet  The Monarch's healing Projects to defeat  Grasp at his Gifts and share the high Reward  But not his Honour or Commands regard  Not Sacred Oaths can their Allegiance bind  Farther than by their Int'rest they're inclin'd  Prompted by Avarice and deep Revenge  With Fawning Face and awkward Zeal they Cringe  But all  that can no Royal Bounty share  Their factious Thoughts and strong Disgusts declare  No Bounds their feign'd Alleg'ance can secure  To Day they'll Swear  to Morrow they'll Abjure  Never did any Prince come to the Crown with a more general Satisfaction of the Party he points at than Her Majesty and the very Persons he is so Lavish of his Invectives against were those who rejoyc'd at the Turn of Affairs both in Church and State As to their Endeavours to  defeat the Monarch's Healing Project  they were such as advis'd it to be carryed on and for  Swearing to Day and Abjuring to Morrow  that Flies in the Face of the Pretenders to Moderation equaly with theirs who seem realy dispos'd for it  The Monarch willing to dissolve the Feud  That spread too fast in their infected Blood  Summons the General Dyet to appear  The Nations and his own Demands to hear  The Parliament was then sitting when Queen  Anne  Succeded to the Throne so that she could not be said to call them together having met before to consider of the Arduous Affairs of the Kingdom  Satyr look back Survey the Glorious Roll  The Life of  Polish  Power the Nations Soul  Poland  's Collection all the Peoples Breath  The Monarch's Safety and the Tyrant's Death  The Ancient Lords of the JAGELLAN Line  Here in their representing Glory shine  With Loyal Hearts and strong Industrous Hands  Ready to hear  Augustus  great Commands  The ancient  Polish  Greatness to restore  Assist with Council and support with Power  To say that the  Antient Lords of the Jagellan Line  whose Titles were Hereditary doubtless  Shine in their Representing Glory  seems somewhat like an Absurdity for our Accounts hitherto tell us the House of Peers Constitute two Estates of Parliament and the People of  England  that is the Inferior Estate are Represented by the Commons  The Monarch's Safety and the TYRANT'S DEATH  Squints likewise at their Old Practice of Decollation which the Party he is Advocate for has no small Veneration for the Memory of at their Cruel Festivals on the Anniversary of Her Majesty's Royal GrandFathers Martyrdom  What tho' among th' Illustrious Troop there's found  Some less Polite than some and some unsounds  The Devil among  the sacred Twelve  appear'd  But Devils  once known  are no more to be fear'd  The General Votes  to

be fear'd but  God  whom the Scripture Exhorts us to the  Fear  of and if he was to  describe  all that were  less True  than  Truth it self  I question whether if the whole Kingdom were to be Number'd notwithstanding his boasted Perspicuity he could find one For God is  Truth it self  and only the Divine Being worthy of that Attribute  Here great  Taguski  first in Order came  Of bright unspotted tho' suspected Fame  Youth had supply'd his Head with Parent Wit  In Judgment solid and in Sense compleat  The Muses him with early Garlands Crown'd  Sublime in Verse and in his Phrase profound  Polite in Language in his Satyr strong  Yet kills with all the Softness of a Song  To steady Justice all his Thoughts incline  Faithful in Council Able in Design  Rais'd by due Merit to the highest Trust  The  Captious Senate  own'd that Merit just  What cannot high Exalted Vertue do  He shows this strange unusual wonder true  The Monarch s Fav'rite and the Peoples too  His Enemies to his just Praise submit  Fly from his Satyr and adore his Wit  In vain they form Impolitick Designs  Envy lies bury'd in her Deepest Mines  For both Sides own this Character's his Due  Always to  Poland  and  Augustus  true  By the Character of  Taguski  though it infinitely fall's short of him we may perceive some Lineaments belonging to the  L Hx  whom he seems here to endeavour to describe  and bears no more Proportion to his Gigantick Merit than a  Mouse  does to a  Mountain Parent Wit  is what also his  Lp  owes his no Thanks for and  suspected Fame  is what he might have omitted as well as  Phrase profound  for I look upon  Profundity  to be an Epithet for the Judgment not the  Word  which it is here applyed to Besides he might have consider'd when he was delineating so Great a Judge in Poetry not to call upon Satyr to describe him while he was endeavouring a Panegyrick upon his Undeniable Accomplishments What he means by calling his  Lp  the  Monarch's Favourite  is unknown to me and he would do the In  tive Part of the World a Kindness if he would explain himself upon that Head  Their  Ruski  with his early Trophies stood  Won from the  Swedes  upon the  Baltick  Flood  When  Conti strove to snatch the  Polish Crown  And all  the Gen'rous  Poles  his Conduct own  The Nation is very much Endebted to the Lord  Od  then Admiral  Russel  for his Defeat of  Torvill  and there is not one among the Party whom he hints at for being Ungenerous but pays him their Acknowledgment for that Days Service  Rigatshi  next our just Applause Commands  The  Polish  Peace on his

the  Swedes  opprest  And to make way for Fools and Knaves dismist  Rigatski  by whom the Lord  S  is Personated King  William  having inv  ed him with Large Demains at Rigate in  Surrey  has the Character of a very Great Man though I can't close with him in his ill Manners to the Present Possessor of the great Seal as to wish him to be Lord High Chancellor again or say that  He made way for a Fool or a Knave  since his immediate Successor chosen by King  William  is deservedly Famous for being the very Reverse of that Inv  ious Apellation  Amongst the  Polish  Prelates there appear'd

Thirteen Mitres more are meant some very Good El Peers who were against the Bill to prevent  Occasional Conformity  and consequently  rue to  Poland  and  Augustus  Which Consequence I shall no otherwise Animadvert upon than that it is Injurious to  Augustus  his Character as if he was against the Bill when he had given such Assurances from the Throne in Favour of the Church Establish'd  These wore the  Polish  Lawrels to the last  And fixt the  Polish  Liberties so fast  That Fate it self cou'd not the Band destroy  But what they once possest they still enjoy  These were the  Columns  which so long sustain'd  The  Load of State  when  Sobieski  Reign'd  Who all the Lines of Government restor'd  And held the Scepter while  he drew the Sword  When he encampt on the  Moldavian  Plains  And freed the  Poles  from  Mahomet  's  Servile Chains  The  Turkish  Banuers to his Sword submit  Abroad his Valour and at home their Wit  They fought with  Equal  Enemies at home  And  Equal  trophies to their Conduct come  The Conquer'd Difficulties of the State  Make all Men own their Conduct to be Great  And they that seek to blame their Management  And charge on them what they could not prevent  Should tell us in what Age it shall be known  No Faults attend the State no Knaves the Crown  That Bishops are Pillars of the Church and Consequently  Co+lumns  no Man will dispute with him but that they  held the Scep+ter  while he drew the Sword I cannot agree with him since it will very much derogate from the Honour of the Lords Justices among whom the Temporal Lds preceding for whom he expresses such Regard made a very great Figure  Ungrateful  Poland  never will be blest  Till  Sobieski  's Management's confest  Till some of his forgotten Rules restor'd  Such Statesmen wield the Scepter  such the Sword  Till some such Heads in  Polish  Council sit  And some such Hero shall for  Poland  fight  England  has been bless'd with more Victories since Her Majesty's Accession to the Throne than what fell to Her Share for a  Century  before which is a long Computation of Years Compar'd to Thirteen and our Councellors Heads have done enough at Home as well as our  Heroes  Hands Abroad to Eclypse the Glory of any Hands or Heads whatsoever King  William  's not excepted  Finski  an upright  Lithuanian  Peer  Sets up for sinking  Poland  's Prime Visier  For Application and Impertinence  No Man has half so much with half his Sense  With Formal Step and  high Majestick Grin  Is  Polander  without and  Swede  within  Envy and awkward Spleen sit on his Face  In Speech precise but always thinks apace  In  Earnest Nonsense  does his Hours divide  Always to  little  Purpose  much  employ'd  Strong in Opinion in his Judgment Weak  And thinks himself exceeding politick  The Musick of his Tongue is his Disease  Conceives absurdly what he speaks with Ease  The Discord of his Facu lties is plain  He talks with Pleasure what he thinks with Pain  And there 'tis own'd he shows some Policy  To make his fluent Tongue his Brain supply  So Men are pleas'd with Shadows so from hence  The World mistakes his jingling Tongue for Sense  A busie trifling Statesman  Proud and Dull  A thinking plodding  wise  substantial  Fool  In all vast  Poland  's far extended Round  No Man was known so  emptily profound  Polite in Words a stiff and formal Tongue  And speaks to little purpose very long  The Noble Peer that falls under his Censure here is as much above his Detraction as the despicable Wretch that flings Dirt at him is beneath his Notice He never Employ'd his Momentous Hours about other Things than the Advantage of the Prince whose Service he was in and as for  sinking  any one it was never in his Thoughts if a Person aim'd at Acted Contrary to the Wellbeing of the Government By  Polands Prime Visier  is meant the  L H T  who owes him no Thanks for giving him an  Infidels Title  which I never heard belong'd to  Poland  before But as the Character of the Great Man whom he vilifies to the lowest Degree is False so are the Terms he makes use of to bring his Designs about by  To him  Augustus  gave the  Polish  Seal  And made him  Grieffier  to the Commonweal  They that cou'd not his License first obtain  Might not go out of  Poland  or come in  The Publick Safety was the just Pretence  To keep the  Sweeds  from true Intelligence  But the more Genuine Reason  was the Pence  For in his time the  Sweeds  themselves obtain'd  His Blanks to pass their Spies to  Polish  Land  Grieffier of Poland  is likewise a Title in no wise belonging to the Court he applys it to and the Publick has been so well satisfied about the pretended Proofs of the Wretch  Fuller  's Affidavity of his Lordships giving Passes to the  French  Discontented Natives of  England  that it looks Ridiculous in one that lays any Claim to sense to incline towards the very thought of it  The slow unsteady Mannager appears  Too  hot  for Peace too  cold  for  Polish  Wars  While charm'd with Foreign  Margueretta  's Song  His sleeping Orders he delays too long  Whole Fleets attend the  Minstrels  softer Notes  By her the Statesman  steers  the Member  votes  Well might the  Syren  be Compar'd to him  That  doz'd old Nature  with his Touch Sublime  The lofty Cedars danc'd  his softer Airs  And  lofty Stupid Statesmen  bow to hers  Mr  Foe  sure is acquainted with the Hermet in the Fable that Blows Hot and Cold with the same Breath or else how could he make his  Slow Manager  which By the By is not to be Hot  too Hot  for  Peace  and too  Cold  for  War  The Wi  est of Men will have their Intervals of Diversion and it looks as well in one Statesman nay better since the Fabrick of the Universe is Govern'd by Harmony to pass away his less Important Hours with Musick than for another to spend whole Weeks with Horse Racing at NewMarket Besides let him consider who was Secretary of State when the Ships at  Vigo  were Taken and Destroy  the Town's in  Flanders  Surrendred and the March to the  Danube  concerted and he must Condemn himself for Blami  ng his Lp's dispatch of the Publick Business  Of all the  Polish  grave Nobility  None acts  so low  that e'er was born  so high  So fond of Liberty he ne'er endur'd  The Name of Slave no not to his own Word  This Paragraph is the Product of a Complaint that this Incendiary vents in all Companies about his Lp's not keeping his Word with him when in Newgate At the same time that he is Conscious to himself he perform'd not the Conditions for which the Promise was made of his  coming to do no Damage  Augustus  saw and soon mislik'd the Man  And found him to the  Swedish  Cause incline  With easiy Skill he read his wellknown Fate  A useless unregarded Tool of State  What tho' the  Polish  Dyet was possest  And blindly in his Favour  once Addrest  The publick Banter all the Kingdom knew  It mov'd their  Mirth  and  Indignation  too  The general fixt Dislike  Augustus  saw  Laid by the haughty Thing and left him to the Law  The  Quacking Mountebanking Tool of State  That neither could be  little  or be  great  Retir'd to give us time to let him know  No Knave's above being told that  He is so  If the Parliament of  England  Address'd the Throne in his Lordships Favour they did nothing but what was consistent with the Reputation of that  August  Assembly and which ought to be allow'd for the pure effect of his Merit as well as  Taguskis  's who had likewise the same Honour done him though not for the  same Service  As for no Knave is  above being told HE IS SO  I agree with him but the Consequence may tell him before he is much Older that an Honest Man is such as the Noblemen whose Characters he makes so Free with  Lawrensky  next of  Prussia  's Royal Breed  To  Ladislaus  by Marriages allyed  Tho' Int'rested in  Sobiesky  's Line  Yet to the  Sweedes  he always did incline  He kept the  Polish  Cash in Days of yore  When Kings grew Rich and made the People Poor  And fain would now our  Polish  Treasures teach  To make their Monarchs Poor the People Rich  Under  Lawrensky  none that is acquainted with  Names  or  Things  but may know that  Lawrence  E of  Rter  is Couch'd A Gentleman too near related to Her Majesty to be us'd after such a manner and whose Conduct as  L H Tr  has not been Excell'd by any Successor whatever without any Reflection upon the Present Management of the Exquer  If Stories known of Old should be reviv'd  Of Leaves torn out and horrid Facts conniv'd  Of Crimes too Black for Satyr to reveal  Which Kings ha' Dy'd on purpose to Conceal  Were but the black Record again Review'd  When the false Peer his Master's Fate persued  His Picture would too low for Satyr lye  And sink the Wretch beneath Authority  VVhether the  French  the  Sax  or  Polish  race  He ever Fawn'd and lookt with  Janus  Face  VVhen  Sobieski  did the Throne obtain  He Grudg  d the Crown tho' his own  Race  should Reign  But when in  ViceRoys  Dignity went Halves  He stoopt to Rule  Moldavian Western  Slaves  The Tearing the Leaves is such a Forgery as has been more than once Exp  ed and Confuted in the late Reign when his Enemies such as G  p'd after his Lord Lieutenantship of  Ireland  publish'd their Sham Vindication and for that Cause requires no other Answer than that those who think it Meritorious to revile a Nm will not stick to Traduce a Rr  Now he Repines the Management supreme  Is not as he contriv'd resign'd to him  For this his  ViceRoy  's Office he laid down  Again to Govern and Abuse the Crown  But wiser Councils laid him gently by  And left him to bewail his lost Authority  His Character is of a much different Complexion for he did not fling up his Lieutenancy of  Ireland  for the sake of the Prime Ministry but for his Ease since the  Irish  are an Inflexible People and not to be Gove  n'd Easily but by such as are the  own Native And he was so far from being dissatisfied with the Measures taken by those near Her Majesty that no other Motive but the Satisfaction in the Administration induc'd him to retire  Now he Cabals the Parties to  Ʋnite  And strives to bring us all to  Peace  in  Spite  Courts ev'ry Side to his absurd Design  And thinks to make the  Swedes  and  Cossacks  joyn  My Soul  his sly pretended Peace abhor  The Brooding  Ʋnion  's Big with  Civil War  Rouze ev'ry Loyal  Pole  to SelfDefence  Give them for  Arms  their  Eyes  for  Swords  their  Sense  For all Men see the empty sham Pretence  Mr  Review  has Preach'd up Peace and Union to some purpose if at last he turns Renegade from his own Principles and makes it his Business to Ridicule such as are for a Treaty between the two Contending Parties Give 'em for  Arms  their  Eyes  says he  Swords  their  Sense  as if  Swords  were not  Arms  why did he  not insert for  Guns  their  Eyes  since  Arms  and  Swords  are the very same sort of Weapons  Old  Seymsky  was of this intriguing Band  A  Polack  born on  Neiper  's Golden Strand  Antient in Crimes bred up to Fraud and Feud  His Int'rest at his Master's Cost persu'd  A mighty Stock of illgot Wealth enjoy'd  When  Polish  Troops our  Polish  Lands destroy'd  When his dear Countries Liberties lay low  He Fisht in all the Troubles made then so  When  Poland  's Kings the  Polish  Peers opprest  And Property was made the Monarch's  Jest  In those dear Days he kept the  Royal Cash  And forg'd those Cheats he since  pretends  to Lash  Now he sets up to save the Nation's Pelf  And wou'd have no man Cheat us but himself  Detects ill Practices with  eager Vote  And rails at Bribes with  mertenary Throat  That he should be Ungrateful and Unjust  Despise the Grace as he betray'd the Trust  Be Proud be Peevish Insolent and Base  Nature has painted that upon his Face  Envy sits rampant on his tott'ring Head  And  Re  's wrote there so plain that every man may read  In  Seymsky  the Reader must agree with me that he points at Sir  Edward Sr  but all to no purpose  Reverberat Ictus  the Shot rebounds upon himself and the  Detracter  falls a  sacrifice  to his own Calumny At the Sitting of the Parliament 'tis  en to one but this  Seymski  makes  Foeski  Eat his Words he has shewn many a Better Man a pleasanter Trick and the  Polish  Scribe will not be the First whom he has brought upon his Knees for Breach of Priviledge For he that Writes  R  upon a Wiseman's Forehead ought to have  Fool  Written on his own besides the rest of the Catalogue of Hard Names which are usually affix'd to Pillories  And now the conscious Criminal appears  Affects to  Cant  of  Poland  's suff'ring Years  Reproaches little Villains with their Crimes  And rakes among the Evils of the Times  Where Mismanagements are there they should be taken notice of for little Evils as well as Great though he's of too Intrepid a Temper to spare them ought to be animadverted upon  That he should  Poland  's Liberties maintain  Who can the wondrous  Riddle now explain  Or who  Believe  the  Fact  that  Knows the Man  Some think  indeed  it shou'd be understood  A  Penitence  for  Violence  and  Blood  To Expiate his Share in  former Reigns  The S  k if not the  Guilt  of which remains  If that be  True  that he should make pretence  To  Censure  others for a past Offence  Savours of most  prodigious Impudence  While he that ought to Blush at former  Times  Boldly  Condemns  contemporary Crimes  A General Charge without mentioning Particulars can never Affect any Gentlemans Reputation especially one of his Figure and Family and h s hints of  expiating  for  Violence  and  Blood  will never make any Impression upon any one that has had the least Notice of what publick Service he had done and continues to do for the good of his Native Country which he may be Styl'd the Ornament as well as Defence of  Immortal Brass sits on his testy Brows  Hard'ned with Bribes with Frauds and broken Vows  Infernal Feuds flame in his guilty Eyes  He starts at Peace with Anger and Surprize  Weakn'd in Wickedness in Wishes strong  A bribereceiving Hand and clamouring Tongue  False to Himself his Monarch and his Friends  But to the lowest Step of Pride descends  Abject and Mean when Fortune's Storms appear  Proud and Intollerable when 'tis Fair  Noisy in Speech in Manner Insolent  And awkwardly submits to Government  If  Immortal Brass  fits on his Brows how comes he to be  Abject and mean when Storms appear  When a Man turns Abject his Impudence commonly leaves him and  dyes  with his being dispirited or I am wrong inform'd from Experience in the like Cases  Often the  Polish  Monarchs have essay'd  So much they of his Mischiefs were afraid  To win the Bully off with gentle Words  And place him in the Class of  Polish  Lords  But he that lov'd the Villanies of Life  And chew'd the Air he breath'd to Sounds of Strife  That liv'd upon those Particles of Fire  Which nourish Feud and prompt the vile Desire  Chose all the glittering Offers to despise  Too  vain  to be made Great too  proud  to Rise  If Vanity consists in a Foolish Persuit after Titles and Applause how can any one be too vain to be made Great And if Pride is the effect of an Ambitious Temper that aim's at an Increase of Prerogative and Power can it be otherwise than Impossible that the Gentleman here design'd can be  too proud  to Rise I have heard of Chewing of Tobacco indeed but never heard of Chewing the Air to sounds of Strife which is a Note beyond  Ela  Augustus  try'd him with uncommon Grace  Gave him his Houshold  Staff  and Houshold  Place  His Robe of Peer attempted to put on  But he put by that  Feather  to his Son  Accepts the high Command without the  Name  Because he covets  Mischief  more than  Fame  The PartyZealot never could resign  His dear Speechmaking old contentious Sin  Resolv'd the Head of  Faction  to supply  And as he  Liv'd  unblest uneasie  Dye  He was too proud  to be made Great before  but here  He accepts the High Command  Ay but says our Author without the Name of a P as if Greatness did not consist more in Extensive Command than Length of Title To  Covet Mischief more than Fame  is none of the most regular Expressions that have dropt from Mr  Foe  since Mischief is Fame in one sense and a Man may as well be Famous that is Transmitted to Posterity for doing Ill things as Good  Augustus  saw the Sullen Wretch go on  Neither by Art or Bounty to be won  His Malice he despis'd his Pride contenm'd  And to his juster Fate the Wretch condemn'd  Left him his empty Follies to pursue  And his unvalued Favours with his  Staff  withdrew  The White Staff was not taken from him but he resign'd it and as Her Majesty Tax'd him with nothing disrespectful to Her  August  Character the Poet would have look'd like a Man of more V  city had he done the same  Th' unsteady Statesman's  Temper yet untry'd  Left him at once in spight of all his Pride  Not all his swelling Pride would give Relief  But sunk his Spirit underneath his Grief  The cowardly selfcondemn'd abandon'd Wretch  Saw his ambitious Ends beyond his reach  With strong Reluctance all his Honours quits  And with his Places now resigns his Wits  So Pride unbounded with no Power suffic'd  Wants Courage but to see it self Despis'd  How could he quit his Honours with Reluctance when the very  Gazette  tells us he voluntary resign'd them Or how could his  Temper  be said to  be yet Untry'd  on Account of his Places when he had the Experiment made upon him more than once in the surrender of more profitable Employs But Contradiction sis what the Party gain their Ends by and so he's at Liberty to use them  When Men are rais'd by Fate above their Sense  Nature must sink them in  her own defence  Humane Society would else Decay  And  Mad men  quite demolish Liberty  For when the bloated Monster's once pull'd down  The  Soul deserts  the Bubble's broke and gone  Abjectly Wretched and with Shame surpris'd  He  meanly begs  what he before  despis'd  The high Extreme inverts in his Distress  Dejected to a despicable vile Excess  So  Bullies  are but  Cowards  in disguise  Whom few Men Value all Men should Despise  If he was not  rais'd by Fate above his Sense  in being Speaker of the House of Commons Treasurer of the Navy  c  Places of greater Importance by far than the Comp  's of the Houshold 'twas a little out of the way to make him lose it for what was little Better than a Feather to a Gentleman of his Years and frequent Indispositions And to make Nature do it  in her own defence  requires such Explanatory Notes from him as he is not at leisure to give us being so taken up in Reading  Horace cum Notis Variorum  Rokosky  next fills up the spacious Rolls

so what Apellation will our Future Miscarriages fall under when it shall be Visible how we suffer for wantof his Conduct in the Marine Affairs  His Voyages never have been made in vain  He took such

first they Swear to  Poland  then to Him  That they will  both  Support and  both Defend  And  All  profess what very  Few  intend  There from the  Throne  He tells them of the  State  What things occur and prompts their  calm Debate  Tells them his steady Thoughts due Peace to give  And ancient  Polish  Honour to retrieve  How he by  Law  came there by  Law  would Reign  And all their  Polish  Liberties maintain  But lets them know he finds to his surprize  Some  Poles  are  ev'n for this  his Enemies  Freedom of Speech is allowed in the  English  Parliaments but un  er certain Restrictions for some Members have spoke so much  here as to be call'd to the Bar and afterwards sent to the  Tower  for talking too freely As for Swearing first to  Poland  then to Him would Mr  Foe  give himself the Trouble of perusing the Oaths  he Members of Parliament take he would not have occasion to be  old he is in an Error on that Account since they swear to be true to  heir  Queen  and  Country  not

But presses them to  Peace  and  Calm Debate  By the  Livonian  Plot is meant the  Scotch  Plot which was so ve  y  deep  indeed that I never heard of any one yet that found the  ottom of it  It's all

They  Sell  that Prince whom faintly they  Defend  The Commons were as hearty in pursuit of such as were thought criminal  that Juncture as their Lordships though they did not appoint a Committee to meet at  Nd  House and were so very far from  faintly  defending her Majesty that never a heartier and more earnest Address came from a People to a Prince on that Account What remains is to ask the Sense of the last Line and how it is a Consequence that  they must sell that Prince whom they defend faintly  Satyr  with gentle Strokes the  Mischiefs touch  How  little  some Men said how some  too

would rather pay his Acknowledgments to so worthy a Representative than make such unmannerly Comments on what he himself and all the Commons of  England  are so nearly concern'd in  The empty Orator

Understood  Thus he Harangu'd them  Thirteen  times and more  And still he left them  where they were before  He talk'd of  Crowns  of  Property  and  Law  And means to make them  keep themselves in

did no  Harm  If the Poet that Lampoons him were but half so  wise and rich  he would have no Reason to expose himself in his  Saturday's Review July  by complaining of  sleeping Debates in Trade of seventeen Years standing  being  reciv'd  and the very Management and Produce of those  Mines  he is so angry at the Depth of is such an Argument of his Designing that he shews his own want of Brains by saying  No Man ever heard that he design'd  If the Dyet mistook what he said why did they close with his Projection and pass his Bill for the Relief of the Poor But the Poet mistakes him and therefore all must As for the rest of the Jargon of Scandal upon this Gentleman it's all of a piece and his Quibling about his Speeches being made up of all Tail and no Head and his  Convertible Terms

in  For now he Mourns his just Designs are crost  Complains that  Speech  that Place he talk'd for lost  Declares he meant no Mischief to the Crown  Aim'd at no gen'ral Int'rest but his  Own  For that he spoke and thought he should no doubt  Talk  himself  in and talk the  Cossacks  out  But all his Province their Resentment show  All his  Consolidating Nonsence  know  Their future  Trusts  to  Packski  they refuse  So perish all that  Poland  's  Trusts  abuse  Sir  John  is of another Temper than to talk for a Place and of too large an Estate to make his Conscience truckle to his Interest as some that have gone over from the Churchparty have Neither is it Fact that all his Province disclaim his Proceedings they shew their just Resentment indeed for his Affection to his Queen and Country for they have resented it so as to chuse him again for one of the Knights of the Shire which is an Argument that Mr  Foe  shot his Bolt too soon when he said  Their future Trusts to  Pacski  they refuse  When froward  Toweroski  took his place  Zeal  on his  Tongue  and  Fury  in his  Face  "  Ye rev'rend  Poles  says he let Heav'n forbid  "  That Words should  Poland  's Liberties decide  "  Our War's remote but these are  Foes  indeed  "  I'd rather Beat the  Cossacks  than the  Swede  "Augustus  talks to Us I hope in vain  "  Of  Peace  while Factious  Cossacks  shall remain  "  The Spawn of Rebels of  Tartarian  Race  "  Who ask no Favour and deserve no Grace  "  If first  Augustus  will destroy the Breed  "  Then  Peace at Home  may probably succeed  "  But while this Vip'rous Brood the  Poles  betray  "  I'd not  Augustus  tho' himself were here Obey  The Noble Gentleman that is personated here Mr  B  Brother to the E of  A  is of another Disposition than what is  froward  and his Sweetness of Temper is as remarkable as his Loyalty to the present Government which he would not forfeit his Obedience to for any Cause whatsoever Though he has but too much Reason to think our Peace will never succeed at home till such as are averse to it and say  Peace Peace  when there is no  Peace  I mean the Dissenters are remov'd from having any share in the Administration  He said and more than half the  Dyet  bow'd  And with consenting Silence 'twas allow'd  A Law should pass the  Cossacks  to suppress  The only way to  Poland  's Happiness  Mean while th' Assembly sep'rately repair'd  To Church and there the famous  Burski  heard  Now  Stanski  then  Maroski  and a third  That always dealt in  Tropes  and  Similies  absur'd  These furious Priests the fatal Stroke excite  Tell them of Kings that spar'd th'  Amalekite  The Grave Divines in Pulpit Rhet'rick known  Talk'd of the  Dyet  's Wit to show their own  Banter'd a  Text  or two and talk'd some  Greek  And so went Home to  Drink  out all the  Week  Dooms the poor  Cossacks  from the sacred  Text  And rav'd in Zeal till he the Cause perplext  It was but reasonable that a Law should be brought in to prevent the Growth of Hypocrisy and Endeavours be used to save Reprobates against their Wills if they would not be instrumental to their own Salvation themselves and if all the Clergy in  England  had been so deservedly famous as Dr  Birch  some People would have been nearer to that happy State than they now are  Priests  like the Female Sex when they Engage  There's always something Bloody in their Rage  He told the  Dyet  they must  Fight  and  Pray  And pull the  Cossacks  down the  Shortest Way  And in his Zeal so far his  Text  forgot  He Perjur'd his  Augustus  on the Spot  Unchurch'd the Nation Curst the  Polish Tribes  And for their Cure the  Cossacks  Blood prescribes  If Dr  Stanhope  in his Sermon upon the th of  January  at St  Margaret  's Church apply'd the sparing the  Amalekite  to the Subject of that Day it was applicable enough for the Remissness of King  Charles  the second in not taking off all the Regicides has been the chief Cause of our homebred civil Dissentions ever since And if he talk'd  Greek  it's more than the Learned Mr  Foe  can do the want of which Tongue makes him exasperated against all that use it  Satyr  thy just Regret with Force restrain  With  Temper W  ite  altho' thou  Think'st  with  Pain  When once the PulpitPlague Infects the Land  And  SermonReaders  get the upperhand  The Nation's ruin'd all the Town's undone  And Tonguepad Evils thro' the Vitals run  Reason submits its captivated Head  And  raging Nonsence  governs in its stead  In vain our banish'd Liberties we seek  Wisemen are bound to hear when  Coxcombs  speak  Reason pays Homage to Impertinence  And  Noise  obtains the Victory from  Sense  The  Clamouring  Priest Dogmatick Proud and  Dull  Assumes Dictating Right and  calls his Master Fool  How he could Unchurch the Nation by preaching in Defence of the National Church I cannot imagine neither is it in my Power to know he could perjure  Augustus  for Persons guilty of a Breach of an Oath in my humble Opinion must perjure themselves As for his Reflection upon the Priesthood in general he acts contrary to their Precepts and consequently is not to be expected to speak well of them and if he himself  thinks with Pain  then some body does so as well as  my Lord of  Nm a great Condescention truly for our Author to accept of the Character he has bestow'd upon that worthy Pr Well but he has Reason to think with Pain the Church of  England  Clergy are  SermonReaders  they don't  Preach  and  Pray  extempore like Dissenters because they  think  before they  speak  which Premeditation of theirs makes  Reason submit  and  raging Nonsense  govern in its stead Most exquisite Logick  But if the Pulpit now began to Fire  The Press the Pulpits Eccho push it higher  Bold  Sachareski  in a  Polish  Rage  Would all the  Poles  in Civil Blood engage  Prints his exasperated fiery Zeal  And  Damns the Crown for fear o' th' Common Weal  By  Sachareski  it will not be amiss to read Mr  Sacheverel  Fellow of  Magdalen Colledge  a Gentleman whose Accomplishments and Zeal render him as well an Honour to the Church and University as an Otnament to the Colledge he belongs to and as Loyal to the Queen as he is faithful to his Country  And two Extreams one Mischief may prevent  This Fury made the  Polish  Lords relent  And Senators their first Resolves repent  How can Moderation be censur'd for an Extream for that's a Vertue that is inseparable from the Church of  England  and if some Ls and Gentlemen were not so hearty as was expected for the Church's Service it must be attributed to the Weakness of their own Resolves not any thing that was defective in her Worship  The Dyet reassum'd  Cavenski  broke  The Healing Party's Silence first and spoke  The h  sty Priest says he I understood  The Gown  too often  dips  the Sleeves  in Blood  Th' unheard of Insolence amaz'd my Soul  And Horror seizes every Christian  Pole  I am a Northern Deputy 'tis known  Where numerous  Cossacks  dwell in every Town  The peaceful and industrious People show  No Reason why they should be treated so  What is't to us what their ForeFathers were  The  Polish  Crown's too fast for us to fear  Besides Rebellions differ but in Name  In future Ages Ours may be the same  If e'er the Old  Fagellan  Race should Reign  And Damn our Revolutions 'tis in vain  To talk of Titles where the Swords devour  They'r always Rebels who have lost their Power  With all Deference to my Ld Mss of  Hn  's excellent Qualities and healing Discourse Though his Lp is to be commended for standing up for so numerous a People as  Yorkshire  who is so happy in the Choice of so excellent a Champion Mr  Foe  has made him make but an indifferent Speech which is somewhat unmannerly for a Gentleman of his great Quality For I cannot make Sense of  The hasty Priest  says he  I understood  The Gown too often dips the Sleeves in Blood  Besides he introduces his Lp speaking as if the Revolution was a Rebellion and insinuates by way of Comparison as if it was equally criminal with that in  Forty one  The  Cossacks  now incorporate and ty'd  By Laws by Interest and by Blood ally'd  Are native  Poles  in  Poland's  Interest bound  To tack them now would  Poland  's Peace confound  They'r rich and brave and always have withstood  Th invading  Tartars  with their Wealth and Blood  And have undoubted Title to pretend  To enjoy that Land they helpt us to defend  Besides by Laws their Liberties remain  Those Laws  Augustus  promis'd to maintain  This Priest would make those Promises in vain  I think their Liberties their Due t' enjoy  That they may help us now the  Swedes  destroy  With him the old Nobility concur'd  And Damn'd the Bill at Cruel and Absur'd  Who doubts the Dissenters Right and Title to their Estate Heaven's forbid they should be wrong'd in the minutest Particle either as to their Temporal or Spiritual Concerns The Churchparty neither has or ever had any Thoughts that tended towards their no  enjoying the Land  since the late Revolution Neither did the Queen promise to  establish them  only  maintain  them in the Benefits that accrue to them from the  Act of Toleration  The zealous Deputies resist in vain  And Envy prompts them to their strong Disdain  With mighty Struggle and avow'd Regret  They only seem t' adjourn the warm Debate  Resolv'd in future Dyets to persue  The  Cossacks  Ruin and the Nation's too  If the Church of  England  can never be sufficiently secur'd till the Bill passes 'twould be impardonable for them wholly to drop the Debate wherefore 'tis but their Duty to adjourn it to a more convenient Opportunity  Augustus  how unhappy is thy Fate  How hardly do'st thou hold the tott'ring State  In vain of Peace thou do'st the  Poles  persuade  Deep as Infernal Darkness their Designs are laid  Never was Queen happier than her present Majesty and never was Princess more the Delight of the Church of  England  who pays her the Hearts of her Sons by way of Acknowledgments of her Duty while the Offerings of the Dissenters have more of Appearance than real Sincerity  Let them no more thy Soveraign Peace abuse  Subjects can ne'er the Prince's Grace refuse  But 'tis a certain Signal to the Throne  They aim at no less Purchase than his Crown  But still  Augustus  his just Wrath forbears  And Honours load the Wretches whom he fears  Fain he would all their due Allegiance buy  Does all his soft engaging Favours try  To all the Charms of Kindness he's enclin'd  With Grace would win a  Turk  's more constant Mind  How can the Patriots that stand up in Defence of the Church  aim at her Majesty's Crown  Have not they more to lose than the Dissenters Are not they possess'd of the best Estates of the Land And would not a  French  Power be more destructive of their civil Rights and Immunities than those of a Sect of Men who have no Right to any  Establishment  and who have more than once witness their Brethren in  Scotland  closed in with  Rome  and  France  in Opposition to a Worship they are declar'd Enemies of  Dispos'd to Pardon all their Follies past  And win them to their Country's Good at last  Heaps undeserv'd his Favours on their Heads  With gentle Hand to their own Duty leads  Shews them the way to save the bleeding State  And trust them with his Own and  Poland  's Fate  What is hinted here exactly  Tallies  with her Majesty's Usage of the Dissenters since her happy Accession to the Throne but it has always been the Practice of the Party to throw Dirt first and to fence off a Reproach by fixing it upon those from whence they expect it  'Till Treason blacken'd with Ingratitude  Had all their Sense and Modesty subdu'd  Ripen'd by Royal Mercy for Reproof  The patient Prince had been provok'd enough  Whom the Aspersions in this Paragraph belong to may be soon discover'd by the Whigs insolent Usage of Her Majesty and Ministry 'till the last Session of Parliament when a Change was made in the Administration and as for Treason blacken'd with Ingratitude they know best how to form  New  Conspiracies that have been so dext'ious in managing  Old  In vain he's of  Livonian  Plots afraid  And  Swedes  preparing  Poland  to invade  Intestine Feud the  Polish  Rakes persue  Their King instead of  Cossacks  to undo  Neglect the publick Danger to the last  And make the Nation's real Fears their Jest  Willing to leave us open to Surprize  Poland  can have no greater Enemies  As for the Plot here hinted at we may expect Discoveries of th  Authors of it from the Parliament of  Scotland  as soon as they shal  fit 'till then perhaps it may be out of his Power to know whe  to fix it For it's an unquestionable Truth That he that hides a thing is the best able to find it again  Tococksi  first a forward Southern  Pole  A Pollish'd  Carcass  and a  Burnish'd Soul  We cannot say he did the Silence break  For he did always  little else but speak  How vain a thing's the empty Sound of Words  Abstracted from the Meaning it affords  Long Speeches from his  beated Spleen  proceed  And Nature makes him talk to ease his Head  The  Hypocondriack  Vapours upward fly  And form some Words of State and Policy  Bear with the Statesman 'twas his  Flux of Gall  For all Men know he never meant at all  By  Tococksi  we are to understand Mr  Tke  a Gentleman dese+vedly the Envy of all ill Men because he is the Glory of the Go  and who may truly be said to be  polish'd  and of shining Abiliti  if any Gentleman in  England  deserves that Character So that wh  is inserted of him is the very Reverse of his Demeanour and  is so far from not thinking at all that the Politeness and Effica  of what he speaks intimates as much as if he thought always  He dooms the  Cossacks  to  Tartarian  Shades  Their Civil and Religious Rights invades  Demand no Reason Satyr  that's supply'd  With Passion Parties Prejudice and Pride  But if his wiser Arguments you'd know  He heard 'twas Just old  Seymski  told him so  That Learned Oracle supports the Cause  And Noisy Zeal supplies the want of Laws  Can a Dissenter be said to be doom'd to  Tartarian  Shades when it is endeavour'd that he may be rescued from finking downwards thro' the great Weight of Hypocrisy And is it not the highest Injustice to say Mr  Tke  inclines this Way or that Way as Sir  Ed Sr  directs him when Sir  Ed  himself would think it no Disparagement to advise with him  The hot young Beau affects the  Marshal's Chair  And hopes in time to rule  the Dyet  there  Now he's the PartyLeader of the Day  Resolv'd to teach the  Cossacks  how to pray  Or from the  Polish  Church to drive 'em all away  To teach any one to pray after the true  Form of Worship  is to deserve the Thanks of those that are instructed and tho' he does not  affect the Chair  I question whether there is one among his Enemieshas an equal Title to it  A Troop of  Tackers  at his Elbow stand  Ready to move at his usurp'd Command  Who all the Image of their Captain bear  And in their Name may read their Character  The Word  in Polish  signifies  a Fool  A Man without a Meaning call'd a Tool  A weighty Blockhead with an empty Scull  When the Tackers in K  Charles  the Second's Time were for tacking away all the Prerogatives of the Crown the Name of them was not  Fool  then but  Knave  'Twas their own dear Invention and always put in Practice by the Commonwealth Party But for the Church to assume only the Liberty of trying the Experiment once and that for the Preservation of the Monarchy there it must immediately fall under the Name of Folly because successless  Nor let enquiring Heads decline the Name  Tackers  and  Tookites  always are the same  The Emblematick Title's eas'ly known  Their  Coat of Arms  stands up in  Warsaw  Town  Rampant  the Ass  enrob'd  in Lyons Skin  To make the  Bully  keep the  Blockhead  in  Quarter'd at large it lyes  PertePerPale  The  Asse's Ears  against the  Lyon's Tail  He might have spar'd himself making the  Tackers  a Coat of Arms for it's well known they had them from their Predecessors and have not been so good Customers to the Herauld's Office as the Whigs of late Years who have had none to put upon their Coaches 'till they paid for them  The Family from  Tartary  descends  And all the  Furioso  's are  their Friends  Before the  Swedish  Conquest they came in  And some are lately run away again  Their num'rous Offspring fills our  Polish  Rolls  So close ally'd to all our Native  Poles  "We hardly know from whence they came or when  "And yet they boast they're  Trueborn Polish  men  These are the Men would pull the  Cossacks  down  And after them  Augustus  and his Crown  But  Poland  's Genius Laught in  hissing Air  And Guilt made all the Rakes disclose

must be brought in though introduc'd by the Head and Shoulders  Bromski  with  Polish  Air but  Swedish  Skill  Boasts that he was the  Father of the Bill  In Foreign Parts he Travell'd much in vain  Just made a  Book  and so came  Home  again  Tells us he saw a  Bridge  at  Rochester  And when he was at  Chatham  HE WAS THERE  So when progressively to  France  he's come  He gravely says  he knew he wa'n't at Home  Tells us he saw at  Oyse  a sad Distaster  The Bridge broke down because't  could stand no faster  And at  Chantilly  th' Prince of  Conde's  Town  A Castle stood before they  pull'd it down  Montrevil  's fortify'd but is not strong  Paris  lyes round and yet is two Miles long  And of the Buildings this wise  Truth  he tells  They're gen'rally of  Stone  OR  SOMETHING ELSE  Some Lands lye high some lower still and lower  And where the People are not  Rich THEY'RE POOR  The Learned Author then proceeds to tell  How near the  Alps  he clamber'd up a Hill  With many a weary Step and many a Stride  And so  came down again  on t'other side  Tells us at  Rome  he saw a swinging Church  And reads a Learned  Lecture  on the Porch  Inform'd the World in Print where he had been  But bought the Books himself for fear they should be seen  His traducing Mr  Brly  for his Book is no Argument of the Goodness of his own besides his contemptible Treatment of it will render that Gentleman more valuable because his Enemy is so illiterate as not to be able to distinguish between what's a  Learned Lecture  or not And it's enough for him not to have blacken'd him as to other Concerns for had he been guilty of any thing like a Crime he would have been sure of being told of it  This worthy Author warm with  Polish  Zeal  Strives all the  Cossacks  Freedom to repeal  Corrects the Bill and to remove our Doubt  The  Persecution Preamble  left out  A Mark of Honesty to let us know  They scorn'd to hide  what they resolv'd to do  Sure of the Game the Mark was so laid by  And blinder  Cossacks  saw their Destiny  The Preamble was not left out because it favour'd of  Persecution  but because the Dissenters and their Friends in Parliament exclaim'd against it as such  Thus fir'd with Party Zeal he read the Bill  And ask'd the Dyet how they lik'd  his Stile  With many a Learned Speech and formal Face  For  Italy  had taught him  the Grimace  Th' exasperated Fop his Plot declares  And to the Dyet makes  revengeful Prayers  At  Cossacks  Ruin makes the Grand Essay  And tacks the Church's Fall  the Shortest Way  Formality of Face  is all the Sobriety the Generality of the adverse Party are famous for and if the Person that calumniates him had but any thing like his Learning and Breeding he would have made it his Choice to have paid him his Acknowledgments for his Services to his Country not a Return of base Ingratitude forsuch inestimable Goodness  Meerski  an ancient Mercenary  Pole  With vitious Body and a harden'd Soul  Grown Old in  Crimes  as he was Lame in  Sense  But not at all decay'd in Impudence  His long since baffl'd Conscience told his Fate  He owns he's Damn'd  and there's an end of that  But for the  Cossacks  Bill he rav'd so loud  And so inflam'd his old fermented Blood  That some advis'd him to go home  to Bed  Open a Vein or two and shave  his Head  Not knowing he had long ago been Mad  By his Description he should know Sir  Thomas Mrs  no better than Mr  Brly  But  Madness  is like the  Yellow Jaundice  and those that are possess'd with it think every one they see of the  same Complexion  otherwise he would never say this  worthy Knight  was under that Predicament  The  Old Buffoon  Debauch'd in early time  Boasts of his Vice and Hugs himself in Crime  Lewdness has Forty Years forsook the Beast  And left his Vicious Body to its Age and Rest  But tho' the Active part of Vice is Dead  The Rampant Devil  's  Regnant in his Head  Hurries the Leud Distemper'd Wretch along  With Vile  Blasphemous Voice  and  Baudy Tongue  If Leudness has forsook his Breast forty Years then how can the Rampant Devil hurry the Leud Distemper'd Wretch along still for it is impossible for a Man not to be  Wicked  and Wicked

compare Mr  Dryden  who  is the Antient Polish Bard  here meant to Mr  Foe  on Account of his Poetical Performance but for  IllNature  the latter has such an Excess of it that he may be properly said to lose by the Character though Mr  Dryden  had his share too and fell foul upon Sir  Thomas  on Account of a Personal Pique which always carries more Malice than Truth in it  Wardsky  a Deputy of

represents them all  Down with the  Cossacks  is his Darling Word  The Bully Tongue supplies the Tamer Sword  He Damns the  Cossacks  with Exalted Vote  And Horrid Language fills his raveing Throat  Nor does it Check the Man's degenerate Scorn  To think that he  himself's a Cossack Born  Rather than not surpress the Growing Evil  He freely Votes  his Fathers to the Devil  The Earl of  Anglesea  Lord PrivySeal to King  Charles  II whom this Paragraph highly injures in calling him a  Cossack  was advanc'd for his Loyalty and Zeal for the Church Establish'd and being the Father of this Worthy Gentleman made such Provision for his Son's Education as is in no wise consonant to the  Dissenters Communion  For though they have their separate Universities at  Ʋtrecht Leyden  c they are averse to the two Universities here where Religion and Loyalty are Taught and Practis'd Which is an Argument that he did not Design to have his Son bred up otherwise than in those Principles which he so gloriously adhere's to And how a Man can Vote his Fathers to the Devil by coming up to his Father's Direction I must profess my self Incapable of Explaining  Never did University pretend  To  Polish

Poland  's Peace at home begins to fail  The way to make  Poland  unhappy is to follow the Poets prescriptions and perswade all Men to be in Love with his  ShamModerations  and to  advance to

suspected Persons about her such as take Bribes  c  contrary to Her Declaration at her Accession to the Throne but that notwithstanding we are very happy in the Present Ministry we might likewise have been so if those that are removed from it had continued in it  How happy is  Augustus  in his Choice  That makes the  Swedes  repine the  Poles  rejoice  See how the secret black Cabals abate  And quit their Councils to avoid their Fate  The  Malecontents  Discern their vile Mistake  And old degenerate Principles forsake  See how for early Pardon now they sue  And their Allegiance openly renew  What has Satyr to do in Viewing the Man that deserves your  Panegyrick  Prethee  Daniel  leave off this way of Writing or you'll bring in  Satyr  so often that your Writings will be a Satyr upon your self at last  The Happy Monarch sees the Cloud disperse  And distant Peace shall gild the Universe  The  Poles  their Loyalty begin to show  But  Satyr view the Men that made it so  If the Gentlemen pointed at in this paragraph held any  secret Caballs  they were for the good of Church and State  and they are so far from forsaking  their own Principles  that taught them the Continuance of their Duty without any such thing as the Renewing their Allegiance that they are inseparable from them as Heat is from fire or sensation from the Soul  A Prince's Choice of Ministry and State  Determines both his Wisdom and his Fate  Wise Councils may a weaker Prince Restore  But none has these but what were wise before  We agree with him that the Fate of Prince and People depends upon the Choice of a Ministry and that Wise Councils may support a  Weak  Prince but must deny the Consequence that none but a wise Prince can have a Wise Ministry since he has own'd in this very Paragraph that a weak one may be restor'd by one that is Wise  Grave  Casimir  revolving and sedate  The Dyet's  Marshal  plac'd in  Finsky  's Seat  This Guides the Treasure That directs the State  By  Casamir  he seems to hint at the L  H T  who he says plac'd Mr  S Hy  in the E of  Nm  's Place when we cannot but know those Offices of Trust such as a Sec of S are wholly and solely in the Gift of the Crown  Augustus  has found out the  happy Two  That his abstracted Int'rest can pursue  Employ their abler heads t'assist his Crown  Regard  His Interest  and neglect their own  With Equal Zeal in  Poland  's Safety joyn  May all that love Augustus thus Combine  That they are a  Happy Two  must be taken for granted since they are not only in the Prince's Favour and Peoples too but we are not to inter from but to say they neglect their  own Interest  out of  Regard  to the  Queen's  is an impardonable Absurdity because the Interest of Queen and People are Inseparable  No Secret crime their Personal vertue stains  No Swedish Poyson'd Blood  Infects their Veins  Strangers to Avarice they're well describ'd  With  Hearts  untainted and with  Hands  unbrib'd  This is a Compliment they themselves will not allow of for  Sin  is a Crime and there is no Man not the ArchBp himself without it which is enough to infer from thence that all Mankind in general are guilty of some secret Crime or other  The  Polish  Greatness is their true design  How long has  Poland  Mourn'd for two such Men  That count the Nation's Happiness their own  Retrieve our Credit and support out Throne  Our  Bankrupt  Funds and  mortgag'd Cash  restore  And make us  Rich  by  That  which made us  Poor  The Nation's Joy in their Advancement's seen  And growing Triumphs Crown the peaceful Reign  The want of Money makes all Men  Poor  and if they can make us  Rich  by that Want which made us  Poor  then all Contradictions whatsoever my be resolv'd by this Arcanum  Long may  Augustus  their just Cares enjoy  Till their true  Measures  all his  ears  destroy  Till all  Livonian  Plots in  Embrio  's lye  Abortive  Treasons  in  Conception  dye  Traytors surrender to unerring Low  And  Swedish Troops  from  Polish Lands withdraw  A Universal Satisfaction shines  And coming Peace appears in their Designs  A flowing  Cash  will due  Success  secure  'Tis this alone must end the  Swedish  War  For things are altered  Fighting's grown absurd  'Tis now the Purse that Conquers not the Sword  And he that can the  Polish  Wealth Advance  Strikes at the  Root  of  Swedeland  and of  France  There is no Happiness that the Church of  England  wishes Her Majesty not Mistress of who makes it Her continual Prayers that not so much as the  Talk  of a Plot  Scotch  or  English  may be heard in Her Auspicious Reign and that Money is the Nerves of War has been a received Truth since Fighting is become Mercenary no Man of any rational Faculties will so much as question  This  Casimir  has done and  This  alone  Has chang'd so much of late the smiling Sence  These  are the Agents of the  Polish  Peace  To these  we freely own our  Happiness  Firmly the willing  Poles  to these adhere  Love 'em with Joy and Trust 'em without Fear  Fixtly the gen'ral Interest they pursue  With faithful Vigour publick Business do  For  This  Beloved by  Pole  and  Cossack  too  We grant him that the Noble  Prs  represented by the borrow'd Name of  Casimir  has done more than could be expected in a Treasury that had been exhausted by Depreations in the late Reign and while either of two worthy Patriots continue in their Posts without giving us any Cause of Fear and Distrust that they ought to be belov'd by  Poles  and  Cossacks  too  The Conclusion  OF all the needful Helps to Sov'reign Rule  The Usefull'st Thing in  Poland  is a Fool  Among the  Utensils  of Government  No  Tool  like Him supplies the grand Intent  When he's in close  Cabal  and  Council  set  To turn the monstr'ous  WindMill  of the State  The huge unweildy tott'ring Fabrick stands  Too Solid for his Head too Heavy for his Hands  The Force Reverts and with the swift Recoil  Assuming Statesmen perish in the Broil  So Mischief like the high returning Tide  Brings sure Destruction on it's Author's Head  As  Engineers  that ill support their Mind  Sink in the Ruine of their own Design  If the  usefullest Thing in  Poland  is a Fool  then a wise Man is a Fool for wise Persons at the Helm of Government are the  usefullest Things  we can hope for  Poland  how strangely has thy Land been Blest  By Fools Redeem'd when e'er by Knaves Oppress  The Graver Blockheads of thy tott'ring State  Protect thy Fame and help to make thee Great  For when they might thy Government o'erthrow  The harmless  Things themselves  alone undo  The untrain'd Politicians court their Fate  If  Knaves  were never  Fools  they'd soon blow up the State  That's very strange indeed to be  redeem'd by Fools  and almost as much as to say when we were at the brink of Ruin by a parcel of  Knaves  who shar'd the Administration in King  James  's Reign the Fools interpos'd in our Behalf and brought about the late Rvoln  Here Men the  Dignity of Folly  gain  And never live without their Wits  in vain  The empty  Head  and noisy  Tongue  appear  A Step to Fame and Dubs a  Polish  Peer  Coxcombs  of hug uncommon Size we find  And  Fools  beyond the Rate of Human Kind  No Nation can such  happy Blackheads  show  Ecols  of  Design  and  Fools  of  Learning  too  With necessary  Dulness  so supply'd  Their want of  Brains  has all their  Vice  destroy'd  So Gravely  silly  so Refin'dly  dull  So Clear the  Head  and yet so Thick the  Skull  So damn'd to  Forms  and so Ty'd up to  Rules  Poland  shall vye with all the World for  Fools  In Council  Hasty  in Performance  Slow  No Nation such a Breed of  Fools  can show  Purseproud and Fanciful they boast of Sense  A certain Sign 'tis but a vain pretence  Loss of Discretion's their chief Happiness  No Men that want their Brains can want them less  So that  Folly  's a Dignity and  Dubs a Polish Peer  which is a sort of PettyTreason because it's the Queen alone who Dubs a Commoner a Peer and insinuates as if Her Sacred Majesty was Guilty of Shortsightedness in the Distribution of Her Royal Favours and could not distinguish a Wise Man from a Fool  Retrabas aut Vapules mi Poetula  These are the Manufactures of the Land  The Props on which our  Polish  Freedoms Stand  That many a  Polish  Province represent  And joyn'd with  Knaves  make up a  Polish  Parliament  That help to puzzle Causes in the  House  And  Hunt  a Question as a  Fox  a  Goose  Strange Miracles they often times perform  And  Calm  the  Dyet  when 'tis in a  Storm  Meersky  and Grand Exper'ment often made  Has made them  Laugh  and  Rage  be  Pleas'd  and Mad  Nature made  Fools  a  Dernier  high  Resort  To  temper  men of  Sense  and make them  Sport  Like  David  's Harp they can the Nation Doze  And drive the  Devil  from the  Crazy House  To compare a Fool to  David  's Harp is a little Prophane as it is to liken Sir  Tho Mr  to  David  who was a Man after God's own Heart  and huntiug a Qnestion like a Fox a Goose  is such an  Attribute of a  Fool  as I never heard of Before since a  Fox  is look'd upon to be the most Cunning Creature among the whole Four Legged Race  Satyr  forbear to Search the Wound too far  Lest  Poland  's latent Errors should appear  'Its Enough the Nation knows the Curst Design  Has broke the Project and has  Markt the Men  Augustus  sees Heav'n has his Soul informed  The  Fools  are all laid by the  Knaves  disarmed  Wisdom  and  Temper  settles  Poland  's Fate  And  Moderation  Guides the Helm of State  Tis this makes  Poland  Safe this makes  Augustus  Great  Now He has made His Satyr say all the Malicious Things He could Invent of Her Majestys best Subjects He very Mercifully calls upon Satyr to Forbear just like a Certain Great General at the  Boyne  who sent orders to  give Quarter after all his Enemies  had been put to the Sword If it be true that all the  Fools  and  Knaves  are laid by and disarm'd then the  Tackers  are neither  Fools  nor  Knaves  as He has Intimated since there are above chosen for Parliament Men out of the And  England  Thou ar't the Happiest spot in the whole Universe and so God Bless the Queen's most Excellent Majesty  Oh may thy Angel guard Her Royal Mind  That Favourites not educe nor Trimmers blind  For 'tis on Her thy Church and State depend  With Her will flourish and with Her will end  FINIS
