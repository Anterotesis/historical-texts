 THE DESERT ISLAND A DRAMATIC POEM IN THREE ACTS  As it is Acted at the TheatreRoyal in DruryLane  Te dulcis conjux te solo in littore secum  Te veniente die te decedente canebat  VIRG  LONDON Printed for PAUL VAILLANT facing Southamptonstreet in the Strand MDCCLX  Price One Shilling and Six Pence  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following Piece is founded on the Isola Disabitata of the celebrated ABBE METASTASIO In reading the Perform∣ance of that great Genius the present Writer received so exquisite a Pleasure that he contracted a Passion for the Subject and could not refrain from exercising his Pen upon it In the Prose∣cution of his Plan he knew enough of the mo∣dern Theatre to perceive that it was thin of what our Playfollowers call Business and he was aware that on the Stage it might prove to use  Milton  's Words  very different from what among us passes for Best  The same Remark was made by a Friend of the Author's who thought it hazardous to offer to a popular Assembly a Piece in which there were none of those Strokes that generally succeed with the Multitude "Can't you" said he  throw in something here and there to season it more to the public AppetiteSuppose you were to change the Title and fix the Scene among the  Anthropophagi  or among the  Men whose Heads do grow beneath their Shoulders  a few of those extraordinary Personages exhibited on the Stage will prove very acceptableWhat think you of an  Irish  Servant in itThat certainly will insure Success the more especially if you add some aerial Beings and conclude the Whole with a drunken Song by the Tars of  Old Eng∣land  The Author was sensible of the Force of these Observations but the GREAT MILTON mentioned above stared him in the Face with his Reflections on  the Error of introducing tri∣vial and vulgar Persons which by all Judicious hath been counted absurd and brought in with∣out Discretion CORRUPTLY to gratify the Peo∣ple  Vide  Preface to  Samson Agonistes  He therefore determined to preserve the  Integrity of his original Design and to try what would be the Effect of a simple Fable with but few Incidents supported entirely by the Spirit of Poetry Sentiment and Passion To combine these there Qualities is indeed an arduous Task and the Author therefore does not flatter himself that he has entirely succeeded in so difficult an Attempt  In Justice to METASTASIO he thinks proper to inform the mere  English  Reader that he hath not been a Translator on this Occasion but has fol∣lowed the Impulse of his own Imagination ex∣cepting in a few Passages The ITALIAN POET gave the Fable the present Writer made his own Use of it or in other Words the Groundwork or  Canevas  as the  French  call it is METASTASIO'S for the Colouring Mr  Murphy  is answerable  He could not but be surprized to find that on the first Night the Scene in the third Act between  Sylvia  and  Henrico  was deemed equivocal There is always a sufficient Number ready to ascribe to an Author various Meanings which he never had "and see at Cannon's what was never there"To these Gentlemen he returns his Thanks but the Species of Wit which they are willing to allow him he begs leave publickly to disclaim The Cha∣racter of a Girl who has never seen a Man and who has been taught to think of such a Being with Horror is merely imaginary but the possible or Poetical Existence of such a Girl being once esta∣blished it is to be wished that the Critics would agree what Questions it is natural for her to ask on her first Interview with a Man METASTASIO makes her say  Che vuoi da me  Un Uom Sei dunque  Andiamo Insieme  Ah troppo ron trattenerli  c  And these little Touches so differently do we judge in  England  were thought abroad to be deli∣cate Strokes of the most elegant Simplicity  He could wish it had been universally under∣stood that it was not a TRAGEDY he offered to the Public but a DRAMATIC POEM that is to say a Piece with some interesting Situations to engage the Affections but which affords more Room for a Picturesque Imagination to display itself than is generally allowed to the more important Concerns of real Tragedy where the Distress should be al∣ways encreasing where the Passions should be al∣ways rising to fuller and stronger Emotions and where of Course the Poet ought not to find Lei∣sure for Imagery and Description Had this been felt and acknowledged no Body would have looked for another Kind of Entertainment than was pro∣mised and the Smiles arising from SYLVIA'S Dread of a Man on the first Discovery of him and her gradual Attachment to him in Compliance with natural Instinct would never have been judged inconsistent with the Colour of the Whole But if the Author of the  Desert Island  has erred in this he has the Consolation of having erred with the greatest Poet now in  Europe  As many of the malevolent Writers of the Age have heretofore honoured the Author with their Abuse and as he was apprehensive that they still remained under the Oppression of their Dullness and Obscurity it was deemed proper to call them forth into Daylight by exhibiting one general Representative of them all on the Stage For this he returns his Thanks to the Author of the Prologue and if any needy Booksellers or un∣happy Authors can find their Account in taking further Liberties with him he hereby declares he should be sorry not to have Merit enough to pro∣voke some of them and for their Encouragement  he adds in the Words of the noble Author of the  Characteristics  that  He will never reply un∣less he should hear of them or their Works in any good Company a Twelvemonth after  Lincoln's Inn  Jan  The AUTHOR  PROLOGUE Written and Spoken by Mr GARRICK In the Character of a DRUNKEN POET  ALL all shall outall that I know and feel  I will by

grottos flowering shrubs exotic trees and plants growing wild On one side is a cavern in a rock over the entrance of which appears in large characters an unfinish∣ed inscription  CONSTANTIA  is discovered at work at the inscription in a romantic habit of skins leaves and flowers in her hand she holds a broken sword and stands in act to finish the imperfect inscription  After a short pause she begins  R  EST rest my arm ye weary sinews rest  Awhile forget your office On this rock  Here sit thee down and think thyself to stone  Sits down  Would heav'n I could  rises  Ye shrubs ye

PRETENDING TO LAND HER FOR REFRESHMENT FROM THE DANGERS OF A STORMY SEA BARBAROUSLY LEFT HER ON THIS UNHOSPITABLE ISLAND WHERE SHE ENDED HER DEPLORABLE LIFE FRIEND WHOE'ER THOU ART PITY MY WRONGS BUT

You'll deign to view me grant my earnest pray'r  Let me but finish this my sad inscription  Then let this busy this afflicted heart  Be still at once and beat my breast no more  She goes on with her work  Enter  SYLVIA  SYLVIA  My dearest mother oh quite out of breath  CONSTANTIA  What is the matter child  SYLVIA  Why ma'am my heart  Beats wild with joy oh such an incident  CONSTANTIA  What incident my sweet  SYLVIA  My little fawn  My dear my loveliest fawn for many days  Whose loss I've mourn'd for whose dear sake I've left  No corner of the isle unsearch'd this moment  O'er the dewspangled lawn with printless feet  Came bounding to me playful frisk'd about  With inexpressive airs of glad surprize  With eager signs of transportBig round tears  Stood trembling in his eye and seem'd to speak  His fond regret still mingling with his joy  CONSTANTIA  And is it that my love delights thee so  SYLVIA  And can you wonder ma'am yes that de∣lights me  Transports me charms me he's my darling care  My dear companion my sweet little friend  That loves me gambols round me watches still  With anxious tenderness my ev'ry motion  Pants on my bosom leaps into my arms  And wanders o'er me with a thousand kisses  Before this time he never once stray'd from me  I thought I lost him but he's found again  And can you wonder I'm transported thus  CONSTANTIA  Oh happy state of innocence how sweet  Thy joys simplicity e'er yet the mind  With artificial passions learns to glow  Ere taste has ta'en our senses to her school  Has given each wellbred appetite her laws  Taught us to feel imaginary bliss  Or elss expire in elegance of pain  SYLVIA  Nay now again you're growing grave'tis you  Give laws to appetite forbid each sense  To minister delight your eyes are dimm'd  With constant tears the roses on your cheek  Fade like yon violets when excessive dews  Have bent their drooping melancholy heads  Soon they repair their graces soon recal  Their aromatic lives and smiling yield  To sighing Zephyr all their balmy sweets  To grief you're still a prey still wan despair  Sits with'ring at your heart and ev'ry feature  Has your directions to be fix'd in woe  Nay pr'ythee now clear upyou make me sad  Will you Mama forget your cares  CONSTANTIA  Forget  Oh sweet oblivion thy allhealing balm  To wretches you refuse can I forget  Perfidious Ferdinand His tyrant form  Is ever present The deluding looks  Endearing accents and the soft regards  With which he led me to yon mossclad cave  There to repose awhile oh cruel man  And you ye conscious wilds I call you false  Accomplices in guilt The Zephyrs bland  That pant upon each leaf the melody  That warbles thro' your groves the falling foun∣tains  That at each deep'ning cadence lull the mind  Were all suborn'd against me all conspir'd  To wrap me in the silken folds of sleep  Sudden I wake where where is Ferdinand  I rave I shriek no Ferdinand replies  Frantic I rove thro' all your winding glades  I seek the shore no Ferdinand appears  I climb yon craggy steeps I see the ship  Unfurling all her sails I call aloud  I stamp cry out deaf as the roaring sea  He catches ev'ry gale that blows from heav'n  And cleaves his liquid way  SYLVIA  Why will you thus  Recal your past afflictions  CONSTANTIA  Ah what then  Thou wretched Constance what were then thy feelings  I rend my tresses beat my breast in vain  In vain stretch out these ineffectual arms  Pierce with my frantic cries the wounded air  Dash my bare bosom on the flinty rock  Then rise again and strain my aching sight  To see the ship still less'ning to my view  And take the last last glimpse as far far off  In the horizon's verge she dwindles still  Grows a dim speck and mixes with the clouds  Just vanishing just lost ah seen no more  SYLVIA  I pr'ythee don't talk somy heart dies in me  Why won't you strive a little to forget  This melancholy theme the twilight grey  Of morn but faintly streaks the east the stars  Still glimmer thro' the whit'ning air the groves  Are mute yon alldevouring deep lies hush'd  The tuneful birds and the whole brute creation  Still sink in soft oblivious slumber wrapp'd  Forgetful of their caresall all but you  Know some repose you pass the dreary night  In tears and ceaseless grief then rising wild  Anticipate the dawn and here resume  Your doleful task or else ascend the height  Of yonder promontory there forlorn  You sit and hear the brawling waves beneath  Lash the resounding shore your brimful eye  Still fix'd on that sad quarter of the heav'ns  Where my hard father disappear'd  CONSTANTIA  Yes there  My melancholy loves to dwell there loves  To sit and pine over its hoard of grief  To roll these eyes o'er all the sullen main  In hopes some sail may this way shape its course  With tidings of the human raceOh heav'ns  Could I behold that dear that wish'd for sight  Could I but see some vestiges of man  Some mark of social life ev'n tho' the ship  Should shun this isle and court propitious gales  Beneath some happier clime yet still the view  Would chear my soul and my heart bound with joy  At that faint prospect of my fellow creatures  But not for me such transportnot for me  Dear native land I now no more must see thee  Condemn'd in everduring solitude to mourn  From thy sweet joys society debarr'd  SYLVIA  But to your happiness what's wanting here  Full many a time I've heard you praise the arts  The polish'd manners and gay scenes of bliss  Which Europe yields yet ever and anon  I from your own discourse can gather too  That happiness is all unknown to Europe  That envy there can dwell and discontent  The smile that wakens at another's woe  The heart that sickens at another's praise  The tongue that carries the malignant tale  The little spirit that subverts a friend  Fraud perfidy ingratitude and murder  Now sure with reason I prefer these scenes  Of innocence tranquillity and joy  CONSTANTIA  Alas my child 'tis easy to forego  Unknown delights pleasures we've never felt  SYLVIA  Are we not here what you yourself have told me  In Europe sovereigns are here we have fix'd  Our little sylvan reign The guileless race  Of animals that roam the lawns and woods  Are tractable and willing subjects pay  Passive obedience to us and yon sea  Becomes our tributary hither rolls  In each hoarsemurm'ring tide his various stores  Of daintiest shellfish the unbidden earth  Of human toil all ignorant pours forth  Whatever to the eye or taste can prove  Rare exquisite and good at once the spring  Calls forth its green delights and summer's blush  Glows on each purple branch The seasons here  On the same tree with glad surprize  Behold each other's gifts arise  Spontaneous fruits around us grow  For ever here the Zephyrs blow  Shrubs ever flow'ring  Shades embow'ring  Heav'nly spots  Cooling grots  Verdant mountains  Falling fountains  Pure limpid rills  Adown the hills  That wind their way  And o'er the meadows play  Enamour'd of th' enchanted ground  CONSTANTIA  What is this waste of beauty all these charms  Of cold inanimate unconscious nature  Without the social sense those joys my Sylvia  Thou can'st not miss for thou hast never known 'em  SYLVIA  But still those beauteous tracts of Europe  Which you so much regret are full of men  And men you know are animals of prey  I'm sure that you yourself have told me so  A thousand times  CONSTANTIA  And if I have my child  I told a dismal truth Oh they are false  Inexorable cruel fell deceivers  Their unrelenting hearts no harbour know  For honour truth humanity or love  SYLVIA  Well then in this lone isle this dear retreat  From them at least we're free  CONSTANTIA  Poor innocent  I can't but grieve for her  Bursts into tears aside  SYLVIA  Why fall afresh  Those drops of sorrow pray you now give o'er  CONSTANTIA  My heart will breakI do not grieve my child  I can't conceal my tearsthey must have way  SYLVIA  Nay if you love me sure you will not thus  Make my heart ake within me  CONSTANTIA  No my sweet  I will not weep all will be well my love  Oh misery I can't I can't contain  The black ingratitude  Weeps  SYLVIA  Say is there aught  That I can do Mama to give you comfort  If there is tell me shall I fetch my fawn  Dry up your tears and he is your's this moment  I'll run and bring him to you  CONSTANTIA  Sylvia no  SYLVIA  Nay do MamaI beg you willyou shall  Exit  CONSTANTIA  alone  Alas I fear my brain will turn the sun  Full sixteen times hath made his annual course  Since here I've dragg'd a miserable being  The victim of despair which long e'er now  To phrenzy kindling must have forc'd me dash  My brain in madness on yon flinty rocks  And end my pangs at once if the keen instinct  Of strong maternal love had not restrain'd  My wild disorder'd soul and bade me live  To watch her tender infancy to rear  Her blooming years with fond delighted care  To tend each blossom of her growing mind  And see light gradual dawning on her soul  And yet to see her thus to see her here  Cut off from ev'ry social bliss condemn'd  Like some fair flow'r that in a desert grows  To breathe its sweets into the passing wind  And waste its bloom all unperceiv'd away  It is enough to break a mother's heart  Let me not think on'tlet me shun that thought  Sits down and sings  I  What tho' his guilt my heart hath torn  Yet lovely is his mien  His eyes mildop'ning as the morn  Round him each grace is seen  But oh ye nymphs your loves ne'er let him win  For oh deceit and falshood dwell within  II  From his red lip his accents stole  Soft as kind vernal snows  Melting they came and in the soul  Desire and joy arose  But oh ye nymphs ne'er listen to his art  For oh base falshood rankles in his heart  III  He left me in this lonely state  He fled and left me here  Another Ariadne's fate  To mourn the livelong year  He fled but oh what pains the heart must prove  When we reveal the crimes of him we love  Reenter  SYLVIA  SYLVIA  I cannot bring him now in yonder stream  That thro' its pebbled channel glides along  Softmurm'ring to the sea he stands to cool  His beauteous form in the pure limpid rill  But still he shall be your's  CONSTANTIA  To thee my child  To thee he causes joy but joy to me  There's nothing now can bring left by my husband  By the false barb'rous man  SYLVIA  And yet this man  You still regret mdash you must excuse me now  I vow I can't but think 'midst all your grief  All your reproaches your complaints against him  That still this man this cruel fell deceiver  Has foundI know not whywithin your breast  Some tender advocate to plead his cause  CONSTANTIA  No Sylvia no my love is turn'd to hate  SYLVIA  Then dry your sorrows and this day begin  A happier train of years and lo the sun  Emerges from the sea He lists his orb  Above the purpled main and streams abroad  His golden fluid o'er the world the birds  Exulting wake their notes all things rejoice  And hills and groves and rocks and vallies smile  Let me entreat you then forget your cares  And share the general bliss  The sun is seen to rise at a distance as it were out of the sea  CONSTANTIA  Once more all hail  Thou radiant power who in your bright career  Or rising or descending hast beheld  My neverceasing woe again thou climb'st  In orient glory and recall'st the cares  And toils of man and beastbut oh in all  Your flaming course your beams will never light  Upon a wretch so lost so curst as I am  SYLVIA  And yet my mother  CONSTANTIA  Mine are pangs my child  Strokes of adversity no time can cure  No lenient arts can soften or assuage  But I'll not grieve thee Sylvia I'll retire  To some sequester'd hauntThere all forlorne  I'll sit and wear myself away in thought  Exit  SYLVIA  alone  Alas how obstinately bent on grief  Is her whole mind the votarist of care  In vain I try to soften her afflictions  And with each art beguile her from her woe  I chide intreat caress and all in vain  And what to me seems strange perverse and wond'rous  The more I strive the more her sorrows swell  Her tears the faster fall fall down her cheek  In streams so copious and such bitter anguish  That I myself at length I know not how  Catch the soft weakness and o'erpow'r'd with grief  Flow all dissolving in unbidden tears  Assist her heav'n Her heart will break at last  I tremble at the thought I'll follow straight  And still implore beseech try evr'y way  To reconcile her to herself and me  But see look yonder what a sight is there  What can it mean that huge enormous mass  That moves upon the bosom of the deep  A floating mountain no a mountain never  Could change its place for such a monstrous bulk  How light it urges on its way how quick  How rapid in its course What can it be  I'll tow'rd the shore and from the pointed rock  That juts into the waves at leisure view  This wond'rous sight and what it is explore  END of the first ACT  ACT II  SCENE  Another view of the island with an opening to the sea between several hills and rocks  Enter  SYLVIA  SYLVIA  STILL I behold itstill it glides along  Thro' the tumultuous sea and lo before it  The waves divide and now they close again  Leaving a tract of angry foam behind  It must be sure some monster of the deep  For see upon its huge broad back it bears  Expanded wings that spreading to the wind  Lie broad incumbent o'er the surge beneath  Ah save me save me what new forms appear  What shapes of unknown being rise before me  From yon huge monster"s side they issue forth  And bolt upon the shore behold they stop  And now with eager disconcerted pace  Precipitate rush forward on the Isle  Now 'mongst the rocks they wind their silent way  FERDINAND  and  HENRICO  appear  Protect me heav'n defend me shield meah  Hide me ye woods within your deep recess  Ne'er may these monsters penetrate your haunts  Ne'er trace my footsteps thro' your darksome ways  Behind the covert of this woodbine bow'r  Oh let me rest conceal'd  She retires  FERDINAND  and  HENRICO  come forward  HENRICO  No trace appears  No vestige here is seen of human kind  'Tis drear 'tis waste and unfrequented all  And hark what noise from yonder toil∣ing deep  How dreadful sounds the pealing roar my friend  My valued Ferdinand 'twere best retire  This cannot be the place  FERDINAND  Oh my Henrico  This is the fatal shore the wellknown scene  Yon bay yon rocks yon mountains from whose brows  Th' imbow'ring forest overhangs the deep  Each wellremember'd object strikes my view  Answers the image in my mind preserv'd  Engraven there by love's recordinghand  And never but with life to fade from thence  HENRICO  And yet thy loveenfeebled soul may form  Imaginary tokens of resemblance  This soil unbeaten seems by mortal step  FERDINAND  No my Henrico no this is the spot  My heart in ev'ry pulse confirms it to me  This is the place the very place where fate  Began to weave the tissue of my woes  Oh I was curst abhorr'd of heav'n or else  I ne'er had trusted the contentious waves  But kept my store of happiness at home  HENRICO  Repine not for an action that arose  From filial piety a father's mandate  Requir'd obedience from you  FERDINAND  To his summons  I paid a glad attention yet good heav'n  Why in that early aera of my bliss  Should then his orders come to dash my joys  Oh I was blest with all that rarest beauty  With all that ev'ry Venus of the mind  The tender heart and the enliven'd wit  Could pour delightful on the raptur'd sense  Of the young bridegroom whose admiring eyes  Still hung enamour'd on her ev'ry charm  And thence drank long inspiring draughts of love  Unsated still still kindling at the view  HENRICO  Thy fate indeed was hard  FERDINAND  Heav'n knows it was  Each soft desire each joy refin'd was mine  The hours soft glided by and as they pass'd  Scatter'd new blessings from their balmy wings  They saw our ever new delight they saw  A blooming offspring crown our mutual loves  The mother's features and her ev'ry grace  In this our daughter exquisitely trac'd  But to be torn from that supreme of bliss  My wife Constantia and my beauteous babe  Here to be left on this untravell'd isle  To pine in bitterness of want their bed  The cold bare earth while the inclement winds  From yonder main came howling round their heads  Until at length the friendly hand of death  In pity threw his shrowd upon their woes  HENRICO  Too sure I fear they're lost  FERDINAND  Perhaps my friend  Perhaps when gasping in the pangs of death  When ev'ry beauty faded from her cheek  And her eye languish'd motionless and dim  Perhaps ev'n then in that sad dismal hour  My name still hover'd on her quiv'ring lips  And nought but death could tear me from her heart  HENRICO  Her tend'rest thoughts no doubt were fix'd on thee  FERDINAND  Her tend'rest thoughts oh no her utmost rage  Who knows Henrico but she deem'd me false  Deem'd me a vile deserter from her arms  She did she must each strong appearance join'd  To mark me guilty Oh that thought strikes deep  It's scorpion stings into my very heart  Could she but think me so refin'd in guilt  So exquisite a villain as to cause  A moment's anguish in that tender breast  Where all the loves where all the virtues dwelt  'Twere misery 'twere torture in th' ex∣treme  And yet she thought me suchby heav'n she did  Accus'd me of the worst the blackest treason  Of treason to my love stung with th' idea  She roam'd this isle and to these desert wilds  Pour'd forth her lamentable tale who knows  But on some craggy cliff whole nights she sat  Raving in madness to the moon's pale gleam  Until at length all kindling into phrenzy  Clasping her infant closer to her breast  With desperation wild from off the rock  Headlong she plung'd into the roaring waves  While her last accents murmur'd faithless Fer∣dinand  HENRICO  Distract not thus your soul with fancied woes  She could not think thee faithless thee whose mind  Whose ev'ry virtue were so well approv'd  FERDINAND  Still will I hope she did not Oh she knew  I made that voyage in duty to a father  A while we steer'd a happy course until  Beneath the burning line from whence the sun  In streight direction pours his ardent blaze  On ev'ry fever'd sense a storm arose  Sudden and wild as if a war of nature  Were thund'ring o'er our heads full twenty days  It drove us headlong on the dashing surge  Far from our destin'd way until at length  In evil hour we landed on this isle  SYLVIA  returns and peeps from behind a hedge  SYLVIA  Methought I heard a sound as if they both  Held mutual converse yonder lo they stand  They do not follow me what can they be  FERDINAND  There is the spot just where yon aged tree  Imbrowns the plain beneath on which the villains  The unrelenting band of pirates seiz'd me  There I receiv'd my wound and there I fought  Till my sword shiver'd in my hand worn out  Oppress'd by numbers pow'rless and disarm'd  They bore me headlong to the beach in vain  Piercing the air with horrid cries in vain  Back towr'd the cave where poor Constantia slept  With her lov'd infant daughter in her arms  Straining my ardent eyes my eyes alone  For oh their cruelty had bound my arms  And tears and looks were all I then could use  SYLVIA  The voice but indistinctly strikes my ear  Would they would turn this way  FERDINAND  Fetter'd ty'd down  They dragg'd me to the vesselbore me hence  In vain our ship pursuedIn vain gave chase  Form'd with detested skill the guilty bark  In which they plung'd me gliding oe'r the main  Outstripp'd their tardy course they steer'd away  Far to their regions of accursed bondage  Far from Constantia far from ev'ry joy  A doating husband and delighted father  Feels in mix'd rapture with his wife and child  Oh I could pour my plaints but I'll not wound  Thy ear my friend with further lamentation  HENRICO  Would Heav'n I could remove the cause  FERDINAND  Alas  That cannot be Thou can'st not bid return  The irrevocable flight of time recall  The moments of our young delight annul  And render void what once the hand of fate  Hath from it's stores of woe pour'd down upon me  SYLVIA  half concealed  Why will they stand with looks averted thus  I long to see their countenance and mein  FERDINAND  But yet thou best of friends yet grant me this  Assist my search oh let me roam around  This fatal shore the isle's circumference  Circles a scanty space we cannot lose  Each other here do thou pursue that path  That leads due east this way I'll bend my course  HENRICO  By heav'n there is no task of hardihood  Of toil or danger but I'll try for thee  For thee my friend to thee I owe my life  And that more precious boon my liberty  Thou hast releas'd me from the galling chain  From slav'ry's bitter pressure 'twas thy skil  That form'd the plan of freedom seiz'd the vessel  And made your friends the partners of your flight  For thee I'll roam around but oh I fear  Our search will prove in vain  FERDINAND  Too sure it will  And yet it is the doom of love like mine  To dwell for ever on the sad idea  Of the dear object lost to visit oft  A lonely pilgrim ev'ry well known scene  Each haunted glade where the lov'd object stray'd  To call each circumstance of pass'd delight  Back to the soul in fond excursions seek  The dear lamented shade Then oh my friend  Then let me taste that sad that pensive comfort  Range thro' these wilds ascend each craggy steep  Try in each grotto in each gloomy cave  If haply there remain some vestige of Constantia  Exit  HENRICO  On yonder beach we'll meet again fare∣well  SYLVIA  Conceal thee Sylviaahit comes this way  Then let me seek the covert of the woods  Where nods the brownest horror there lie safe  From the unusual sight of these strange beings  Exit  HENRICO  solus  How cruel is my friend's condition doom'd  For ever to regret yet never find  The object of his soul his early love  He lavish'd all on her with her it goes  To the dank grave and leaves him hapless here  To die a lingering death Yet still I'll try  Bv ev'ry office friendship can perform  To heal the wound that preys upon his life  Exit  The back scene closes and presents a thick wood then enter  SYLVIA  SYLVIA  What have my eyes beheld my flutt'ring heart  Beats quick in stange emotions from yon grove  Of tufted trees I saw this nameless being  Walk o'er the russet heath it's face appear'd  Confess'd to view It cannot be a man  No lines of cruelty deform'd his visage  Were it a man his untam'd savage soul  Would strongly speak in each distorted fea∣ture  This was all pleasing amiable and mild  A gentle sorrow bright'ning into smiles  Such as bespoke a calm yet feeling spirit  Sat on its' peaceful brow and oe'r it threw  A gentle gleam of sweetness and of pain  It cannot be a woman neither no  The dress accords not with that mode which oft  My mother hath describ'd Whate'er it be  Attraction dwells about it winning smiles  Assuasive airs of tenderness and joy  I'll seek my mother she perhaps may know  These forms to me unusual By this row  Of darksome pines my steps all unperceiv'd  May gain the place where with assiduous hand  She works and teaches the rude rocks to tell  Her mournful elegy what mean my feet  Why stand they thus forgetful of their office  Why heaves th' involuntary sigh and why  Thus in quick pulses beats my heart my eyes  A misty dimness coversIn my ears  Strange murmurs sound my very breath is lost  What can it beI know thee fear'tis thou  That causest this and yet it can't be fear  Fear cannot thrill with pleasure thro' the veins  Knows not this dubious joythese grateful tremblings  I cannot guess what these emotions mean  Nor what this busy thing my heart would want  Let me seek shelter in my mother's arms  Exit  Scene changes to the first view of the island where  CONSTANTIA'S  inscription is seen  Enter  FERDINAND  FERDINAND  Nonever more shall these fond eyes behold her  Lost lost my poor Constantia lost In vain  I search these gloomy woods In vain call out  Her honour'd name to ev'ry hill and dale  My eyes are false or on the craggy base  Of yonder rock some instrument appears  The mark of human kind  Takes it up  A broken sword  Oh all ye heav'nly pow'rs the very same  This once was mine unfaithful to it's trust  It fail'd me at my utmost need I see  The well known characters the very words  That form'd it's motto 'tis it is the same  Oh were Constantia found what do I see  All o'er with hair the flinty rock bestrew'd  These were her decent tressesthese in anguish  She tore relentless from her beauteous head  Up by the roots she tore and scatter'd wild  To all the passing windsshe still may live  Constantia my belov'd my life return  Constantia ha what

Oh thou wert ever kind and tender to her  FERDINAND  Tender and kind look there there stands the black  The horrid roll of guilt denounc'd against me  Lo the dread characterslet me peruse  The whole

upon some blasted heath  And gloat upon her image see her still  See her whole days with fancy's gushing eye  And gaze on that alone  HENRICO  Arise my friend  And quit this fatal shore  FERDINAND  And quit this shore  But whither turn ah whither shall I go  Where shelter me from misery this isle  Shall be my journey's bound  HENRICO  What can'st thou mean  FERDINAND  Never again to draw the vital air  But where my love expir'dto feed my soul  With these sad objects this sepulchral tale  Ev'n to the height of yet unheardof anguish  To print my pious kisses on the rocks  To bathe the ground which her dear footsteps press'd  With the incessant tears of burning anguish  To make these wilds all vocal with her name  Till this cold lifeless tongue shall move no more  HENRICO  By heav'n you must not think  FERDINAND  Farewell farewell  Consult thy happiness for ever here  By fate I'm doom'd to stay alas Con∣stantia  To perish with thy infant here no friend  To close thy ghastly orbs thy pale remains  On the bare earth expos'd without the tribute  Of a fond husband's tears o'er thy dead corse  Without the last sad obsequies yet here  I still will raise an empty sepulchre  There shall no cold unconscious marble form  In mockery of imitated woe  Bend oe'r the fancy'd urn myself will be  The sad the pensive monumental figure  Distilling real anguish o'er the tomb  Till wasting by degrees I moulder down  And sink to silent durst  HENRICO  What man could do  Already youv'e perform'd  FERDINAND  Prithee no more  I will about it streight this place affords  Materials for the work Thither I'll bring  Whate'er can deck the sceneConstantia yes  I will appease thy discontented shade  Then follow thee to yonder realms of bliss  Exit  HENRICO  solus  His vehemence of grief

as when sad Philomel  Beneath some poplar shade bemoans her young  And sitting pensive on the lonely bough  Her eye with sorrow dimm'd she tunes her dirge  Warbling the night away while all around  The vocal woodland and each hill and dale  Ring with her griefs harmoniousharkthat way  It soundsall gracious powr's direct me to her  Exit  A short song is heard within the scenes then enter

gries with tenderness and love  FERDINAND  The tale shall serve us in our future hours  Of tender intercourse to sweeten pain  To calm adversity and teach our souls  To bend in love in gratitude and praise  To the Allgood on high who thus befriends  The cause of innocence who thus rewards  Our suffering constancy whose hand tho' slow  Thus leads to rapture thro' a train of woe  FINIS
