 ENTHUSIASM A POEM IN TWO PARTS BY MR JERNINGHAM  LONDON PRINTED FOR J ROBSON AND W CLARKE BOOKSELLERS NEW BONDSTREET MDCCLXXXIX  ADVERTISEMENT  IN endeavouring to display the good and bad effects occasioned by Enthusiasm I might have drawn many signal instances from that inexhaustible mine the Greek and Roman story but it appeared to me more eligible to work upon materials hewn from the modern quarry only the subject thus treated I conceived would come more home to the feelings of the reader With regard to the execution that rests entirely on the judgment of the  Public into whose presence I now enter impressed with a mingled sensation of hope and apprehension  ENTHUSIASM  PART THE FIRST  BEYOND th' exalted sun's meridian site  Beyond the glimm'ring stars ethereal height  A brighter realm immortal spring displays  Mid the soft breathing of unclouded days  Where sacred minds to virtue high allied  Aerial beings orient forms abide  Seraphic people ministers of grace  Prompt to defend and cheer the human race  The mighty mother earth who bears mankind  Is to their care and guardian pow'r consign'd  When clashing waves swell high and angry Fate  Tosses the lab'ring vessel of the state  The chosen Angel of th' appointed realm  Hastes from his throne and grasps the trembling helm  To some the honor'd privilege is giv'n  To waft the claydivested soul to heav'n  Weed from the feeling heart the rising sigh  And sweep with viewless hand the clouded eye  Each in his turn descending from above  Performs the generous ministry of love  BEHOLD superior to the sunrob'd quire  A female form to regal pow'r aspire  High on a throne in brighter beams array'd  Reigns in full pomp th' enthusiastic Maid  Daughter of Energy who boldly leads  The hallow'd few to great and splendid deeds  Who urges man the steep ascent to climb  And lifts the soul to virtue's height sublime  Thus when of late to fam'd Iberia's coast  GIBRALTAR  Sail'd o'er the wond'ring main th' unnumber'd host  Swift from her seat th' impatient Goddess sprung  And o'er the spot with anxious bosom hung  Till shedding on her sons to fame consign'd  Some emanation of her dauntless mind  She saw the valiant longenduring band  Whose fall confederated nations plann'd  Achieve that deed which time shall still revere  That British miracle to glory dear  LONG had th' Enthusiast held her rank supreme  Belov'd ador'd of every voice the theme  At length the blast of satire dimm'd the rays  Whose soft effulgence play'd around her praise  The throne encircling frequent murmurs flew  And busy charges trimm'd in motley hue  Yet then confiding in her godlike plan  Which warms invigorates and hallows man  She dares her foes she dares the hostile train  To shake the pillars of her stedfast reign  Urg'd by her innate energy to meet  The gath'ring war she quits her lofty seat  At Reason's bar presents her holy form  Provokes the thund'rers and demands the storm  A living crescent the bright pow'rs display  Rank above rank in terrible array  While trembling silence breathes upon the train  And expectation throbs in ev'ry vein  Amid this scene th' accusing Angel rose  On his stern brow bold indignation glows  Some troubling vision with disaster fraught  Employs detains alarms his wond'ring thought  "What rising structure rushes on my sight  Of bulk enormous of aspiring height  The ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY consisting of four hundred thousand manuscripts was burnt in the sixth century by the order of OMAR whose enthusiastic zeal for his religion forced from him this memorable saying "If the books contain only what is in the CORAN they are useless and dangerous if they contain any thing else"    Th' Enthusiast hast'ning thro' the regal porch  Waves in the eye of day a raging torch  See impious spectacle she fires the pile  And hails the sparkles with a greedy smile  Wide and more wide th' imparted flame extends  And now in dreadful victory ascends  Not sumptuous palaces not awful fanes  Nor of old time the proud august remains  Not airy villas nor majestic tow'rs  High massive bulwarks nor gay pleasure's bow'rs  But to th' unhallowed blaze I see consign'd  The splendid temple of the poet's mind  Ah lov'd TYRTAEUS  TYRTAEUS reanimated the dejected minds of the SPARTANS with the irresistible power of his poetry accompanied by the harp  tow'ring son of fame  Thy pages shrivel at th' insatiate flame  The glorious workings of thy pregnant heart  The sallies from the inmost breast that start  Eloquent threats that lawless pow'r controul  Thy bursts of rage and vehemence of soul  Unrivall'd leader of th' ecstatic train  Farewell for ever lost thy forceful strain  Farewell for ever lost the Spartan song  Which rouz'd to conquest the dejected throng  Did not despondence like a gath'ring show'r  Hang o'er thy countrymen in evil hour  Say did she not her fenny pinions spread  And on each bosom chilling feardrops shed  Thou like the sun a cheerful radiance threw  And from the soil the noxious vapour drew  Till the fall'n soul uprising from her death  Inhales once more th' invigorating breath  Thy voice'Tis honor's call on virtue's train  Thy voiceYes Sparta hears th' inspiring strain  To that vindictive with bold step she speeds  And reaps the harvest of immortal deeds  UNRIVALL'D leader of th' ecstatic quire  Peace to the manes of thy warbred lyre  If peace can be while with licentious pow'r  The hungry fires thy last remains devour  Methinks thy lucid unsubstantial frame  Now hovers o'er the wide destructive flame  I see thee toss thine airy arms on high  I hear at times thy shrill despairing cry  So the fond motherbird alarm'd distrest  Indignant flutters round her peopled nest  While piteous sight a ruthless hand invades  And bears away the music of the shades  SEE to the dome thro' many an age rever'd  The starillumin'd dome which science rear'd  The fiery deluge rolls with threat'ning roar  And sweeps away the longcollected store  Alluring apologues address'd to youth  Pure maxims moulded in the breast of truth  Which from the holy lips of sages breath'd  Rich moral legacies to man bequeath'd  Celestial thoughts which like the fav'ring gales  Whose gentle pressure swells the gladsome sails  Waft the dejected mind with toil o'erspent  To the gaywinding harbor of content  NOW History with a heartfelt sigh surveys  Her themes her annals midst the sounding blaze  Fame smiles no more but with an alter'd mien  Stands trembling at destruction's growing scene  And now methinks she views thro' fancy's eye  Her burnish'd battlements that kiss'd the sky  Her glitt'ring pinnacles her golden tow'rs  That vaunting dar'd old Time's devasting pow'rs  Ascending obelisks that point to heav'n  Triumphal arches to the conq'ror giv'n  She views these honors of her gorgeous state  Dismantled torn and bending to their fate  Ah now they yield they fall with deaf'ning sound  And in tumultuous havoc spread around  At length descending like a lowhung cloud  Oblivion o'er the waste expands her shroud  Beneath whose dark'ning canopy is cast  The fond remembrance of transactions past  Of youthful warriors who by glory led  Bold in the clam'rous van of danger bled  Who midst the storms of state and homeborn wars  Gleam'd thro' the thick'ning shade like morning stars  Till flung untimely from their radiant height  Down down they hurried to eternal night  Of patriots who to honor close allied  In times disastrous stood their country's pride  How these sublime statecolumns tempestproof  Upheld midst bursting clouds the sacred roof  Firm to their cause and obstinately great  No voice of mortal ever shall relate  Nor shall the voice of mortal e'er display  Or annals usher to the eye of day  The various orders of the female train  Diffus'd like flow'rets o'er the smiling plain  Who like those flow'rets in their beauty's glow  Were harshly mangled by the scythe of woe  HERE then to keen reflection's crowded eye  As in a deep sepulchral mansion lie  In iron slumber wrapt and dread repose  A train of human virtues human woes  This moral loss the world must now sustain  Swells o'er the boundary of domestic pain  Calls down the gushes of the bleeding mind  And claims th' expansive sorrow of mankind"  HE ceas'dA Seraph to his cause allied  And firm to battle on th' accusing side  Resum'd the theme his arm exalted high  A wild fire flashing from his pregnant eye  "What numerous fugitives arrest my view  Alluding to the revocation of the Edict of NANTES in consequence of which the HUGONOTS quitted the kingdom    Their cheek discolour'd with dejection's hue  What ruthless pow'r the wanton act decreed  What led the monarch to this desp'rate deed  Beholdth' Enthusiast at the regal chair  Breathes her inflaming whispers on his ear  Now now she urges his reluctant hand  To ratify the terrible command  O hapless lost exterminated race  What can atone this unprovok'd disgrace  Ye venerable men with silver hair  Gall'd by the heavy yoke of thornful care  With dauntless soul enshrin'd in feeble forms  Ye meet the thunders of the rushing storms  Prompt a bold war for virtue's sake to wage  Against the comforts of reposing age  Friends honors kindred country ye disclaim  The smiles of patronage the wreaths of fame  Firm to endure the persecuting rod  And in th' abyss of grief to seek your God  Ye too ye fair on virtue's list enroll'd  Whom Nature fashion'd in her softer mould  In pale adversity's rude science vers'd  Your feeling soul with sorrow's dart transpierc'd  I see you slowly move a length'ning train  Far from the bounds of your domestic plain  Imagination renovates the hour  Ye fell the victims of relentless pow'r  How still ye linger'd on your native strand  Enclos'd by friendship's small but ardent band  How as ye wept caressing and caress'd  Your babes were ravish'd from your throbbing breast  BUT now intruding on my wond'ring sight  My strong abhorrence other scenes excite  Beneath the roof where Death's chill banners spread  An agonizing fair reclines her head  Around the mournful couch of languor stand  In hallow'd vestment a monastic band  Yet not to act affection's sacred part  With lenient hand to draw the rankling dart  Thro' hope's gay perspective command to rise  A soothing prospect of the opening skies  Ah not for heav'nly charity's best end  The gloomy fathers o'er the suff'rer bend  But from th' alarm'd reluctant mind to wrest  The coy assentment to the hateful Test  This relates to a penal law which confiscated the estates of those who did not at their deaths renounce the reformed religionSee SAURIN's SERMONS vol i page    AT this the mourner lifts her drooping head  'While here I languish on affliction's bed  Say is it thus ye minister relief  And whisper comfort to the soul of grief  Disgrac'd accurs'd with hearts untaught to feel  O iron progeny of barb'rous zeal  When harrass'd nature with herself at strife  The last gleam fading on the lamp of life  When to the storm succeeds the welcome calm  When angel hands reach out the victor's palm  Must I that bliss that heav'nly prize forego  And whelm my spirit in immortal woe  Yet then my infants by pale Famine led  Must ask from Pity's hand the scanty bread  Methinks I see them now expos'd to scorn  Their little bosoms pierc'd with sorrow's thorn  O what an image to a mother's sight  The view transports me into madd'ning fright  I yield I yield unfold the fatal creed  And Mercy from his thought efface the deed'  AT these dread words that clos'd th' eventful scene  Religion blush'd and veil'd her awful mien  Yet on the crime from tyrant edicts born  By nature from the dying mother torn  Wrung from the bosom by distraction riv'n  Forgiveness dropt the holy tear of Heav'n  NOW to my view by terrors undismay'd  The glory of the priesthood stands display'd  The virtuous Pastor  JAMES SAURIN the celebrated preacher at the HAGUE where he resided several years and was at once the edification and comfort of his exiled brethren  of the suff'ring race  Proud of his wrongs and patient of disgrace  Him the unhappy fugitives enclose  While thus he speaks'Ye partners of my woes  O Strenuous found in persecution's day  Ye faithful dear companions of my way  I now behold you as the snowwing'd dove  Expell'd the ancient mansions of her love  Whose plumes while clouds o'ercanopy her flight  Assume the splendor of a purer white  Here pauseand while we view th' expanding main  Salute the breeze that flies to freedom's plain  Across the waves ere yet our course we steer  One duteous moment let us linger here  And tho' rejected still to nature true  Sigh to our parentland the fond adieu  Ah far from us remove that breast of steel  Whose rooted principle is not to feel  Which like the sapless oak's timemoulder'd form  Nor heeds the vernal air or wintry storm  On man bestow'd and to the brute denied  The tear of nature sure is nature's pride  Ev'n He the general victim of mankind  Who each disgrace each torture predesign'd  Ev'n He when grief and agony drew near  Felt on his cheek the selfcompassion'd tear  Does not dim obloquy attaint our birth  Are not our temples levell'd with the earth  Are not our kindred friends in fetters bound  Plung'd in the terrors of the cavern'd ground  And we meek victims as we pass'd along  Endur'd we not the loud upbraiding throng  While the loose soldiery added to these woes  With jeering insults and degrading blows  It seem'd as nature mark'd us for disgrace  The outcast offals of the human race  O thou  LEWIS XIV  by all these horrors unappall'd  Whom with delight I royal master call'd  Thou to remembrance now no longer dear  Whom as the scourge of Heav'n I still revere  FarewellThou too by partial fortune blest  All Nature's off'rings breathing at thy breast  Thrice happy FRANCE farewellthese eyes no more  Shall view thy charms that spread from shore to shore  Thy harvests waving with a stately pride  Thy vintage blushing on the mountain's side  Original and selfexuberant soil  Refusing nothing to the hand of toil  And where the Arts a bright harmonious band  Refine exalt and decorate the land  Where Mirth the native of thy social bow'rs  Sheds on each lip his fascinating pow'rs  With thee may bliss still undiminish'd dwell  Hail O my country and a last farewell'  THE Pastor ceas'dThen sorrow burst its bound  With fervent lips some kiss'd their parentground  Some with the same tormenting thought imprest  Tore the wild grass and flow'rets from her breast  To bear a relic of their natal plain  To scenes unknown and realms beyond the main  So firm so pow'rful on the heart of man  Above inconstancy's relenting plan  Is fix'd enthron'd by Nature's hallow'd hand  The glowing passion of his native land  THESE are the evils woe succeeding woe  Which from th' Enthusiast in long order flow  Yet not for these does terror daunt her soul  Mark that proud eye impatient of controul  See riding on that brow imperial will  And tyranny the minister of ill  Let then resentment fierce terrific loud  Burst like the thunder from the rifted cloud  The course of her devasting steps I've run  My journey's o'er the mournful tale is done"  END OF THE FIRST PART  PART THE SECOND  NOW rose a Seraph by affection led  A wreathing glory hovers o'er his head  His flowing accents spotless candour own'd  And on his brow sat energy enthron'd  He speaks"The vulture hast'ning to his prey  With sounding pinions wins his distant way  Regardless of the charms that Nature's hand  In gay profusion scatters o'er the land  And summon'd by the pestilential gale  Speeds to the carcase fest'ring in the vale  So these accusers in their rav'ning mood  Appear to emulate the gory brood  Unmindful of the virtues that surround  The spot on which their censures most abound  NOW deeds long past like exhalations roll  Now nearer move now open on the soul  I see the paleey'd citizens convene  In Hist'ry's drama highrecorded scene  EDWARD III was so exasperated at the long and gallant resistance he met with from the citizens of CALAIS that he threatened to put all the inhabitants to the sword he desisted from this atrocious design on the condition that six persons should be sent to him for the purpose of immediate execution He required that they should approach his presence barefooted cloathed in mourning with ropes round their necks    The dread resolve from EDWARD's bosom sprung  Wild consternation o'er the city flung  With chilling bloodrecoiling thoughts imprest  Entrancing terror deadens ev'ry breast  At length from out the silent depth emerg'd  An ardent chief by glory's impulse urg'd  Th' Enthusiast wraps him in her wak'ning fires  And thus he utters what her soul inspires  'Ye firm associates in the highest cause  On whom posterity will show'r applause  Who while calamity severely reign'd  Well the long labours of the siege sustain'd  Deign to accept what my affections give  And bid your kindred friends and children live  This this will cheer me in the trying hour  When I shall bend at the stern tyrant's pow'r  And the doom'd victim as his rage decreed  On the pure altar of my country bleed  Ah should my strong forebodings tell me true  Pass one swift moment these glad eyes shall view  The destin'd number of the victims rise  To swell the rites of patriot sacrifice'  These words prophetic were not ardor's rant  Five kindred bosoms warm for glory pant  These youths th' Enthusiast fev'ring from the rest  Informs and breathes herself into their breast  And now envelop'd in her active flame  The daring chiefs the pond'rous honor claim  See thro' th' applauses of the grateful throng  The selfdevoted heroes move along  To EUSTACE now advanc'd a beauteous maid  In the rude garb of negligence array'd  Her auburn tresses ruffling to the wind  Her eye expressive of her tortur'd mind  'Say desp'rate youth' the wild'ring fair exclaim'd  'What dire conception has thy bosom fram'd  O deathimporting scenery sight abhorr'd  Whence this attire this ignominious cord  Impell'd by frenzy whither dost thou tend  Relent relent thine impious steps suspend'  With a calm fortitude the chieftain said  'The path that climbs to honor's height I tread  These joyful loud acclaims that rend the air  Wouldst thou convert to howlings of despair  Ev'n love commandswith eager step I go  To shield JOANNA from impending woe'  'What peace' she answers 'can I thence derive  The lover murder'd say can joy survive  While famine sickness terrors I endur'd  Was this the future bliss that hope assur'd  To length'ning care to sorrow still allied  Behold JOANNA stands Misfortune's bride  What time her flush'd expectancies drew near  She meets her bridegroom on the hopeless bier  Had Mercy heav'ndescending Mercy stole  Her gentle radiance o'er the conq'ror's soul  This day escap'd from wide affliction's wreck  This day might I reclining on thy neck  Have utter'd EDWARD's praisethat thought is flown  And each fond project of my heart o'erthrown  When from thy wound I drew the British dart  And with these lips embalm'd th' envenom'd part  Would that the poison like a subtile flame  Had scorch'd my entrails and dissolv'd my frame'  She ceas'dher eye emits a weaker glance  While her dim reason fades into a trance  The youth as if indignant of delay  Drops her pale hand and turns abrupt away  Then to the partners of his fate he cried  'Ye willing victims to my soul allied  Forgive if passion's allsubduing pow'r  Dare to profane this high important hour  Now free of weakness clear of love's controul  I lead the way that runs to virtue's goal'  ARRIV'D at EDWARD's tent the dauntless youth  Resum'd'Invested in this garb uncouth  If at thy bidding thus we meet thine eye  For grace the coward's hope we heave no sigh  Since acts of slaughter are thy soul's best food  O gorge thy rav'ning appetite of blood'  Now with the glowing youths of equal mind  In one resolve one hope one peril join'd  He stands unaw'd by death sublimely great  True to his cause rejoicing in his fate  BUT other scenes of high illustrious fame  Burst on my soul impatient of their claim  Behold th' Enthusiast freedom to regain  Leads her stern Barons o'er the sacred plain  'Tis glory's chase how eagerly they speed  O'er the fam'd ransomground of RUNNYMEDE  To the proud Monarch daring they complain  'Say hast thou not polluted ALBION's fane  And plunder'd thence with sacrilegious stealth  The brightest gem our pride our better wealth  Fair Freedom's heav'nly form Of her bereft  Life is a burden not an envied gift  The bending seer with sorrow's weight opprest  Who beats in his despair his wither'd breast  Shall sooner from his tortur'd mind efface  The wretch who plung'd his daughter in disgrace  Who in his sight compell'd her to his arms  And rudely ravish'd her untasted charms  Than we forgive thy violating pow'r  That wrested Freedom from her native bow'r  Licentious Monarch thy approaching hand  Profanes the ark and desecrates the land'  They spokeeach battleaxe now rear'd on high  Catching the splendor of th' unclouded sky  Cast on th' illumin'd field a sudden light  Whose rapid flash o'erpower'd the monarch's sight  Upbraiding thoughts his wav'ring mind assail'd  And fear the tyrant's curse his aspect pal'd  At length he seals with mean reluctant soul  To BRITAIN ever dear th' immortal scroll  Hail welcome instance of submitting pow'r  Hail holy Freedom's sacramental hour  In which that offspring of indulgent Heav'n  Was with dread pomp to ENGLAND's sons regiv'n  Now thro' disclosing skies th' angelic train  Pour on th' enraptur'd ear the choral strain  'Be cheerful praise be salutations paid  'And hymns symphonious to the godlike Maid  'Whose energy resists the tyrant's plan  'Joy be to Saints and liberty to Man'  FROM Time's dark gulph revolving back to light  What newborn image rushes on my sight  The bold COLUMBUS dedicates his sail  To the wild breathing of a stranger gale  Th' Enthusiast bids his dauntless soul explore  Realms unreveal'd and seas unplough'd before  The hour now ripening in the womb of time  Th' inspir'd adventurer reach'd the point sublime  The longobscuring veil for him was furl'd  And on his vision burst another world  Ecstatic Wonder heard the proud event  And o'er the ocean the glad tidings sent  Then Industry as by electric stroke  From her enduring sleep instinctive broke  With brightest omens of her future reign  This better VENUS rising from the main  Saw from all harbours rushing with the tide  Unnumber'd vessels at her beck'ning glide  Did it not seem as if the sever'd earth  Like two fair sisters parted from their birth  Acknowledging at length their kindred race  Felt the warm transport of a first embrace  NOW the same age a different scene presents  And the bold vision labours with events  Methinks I see extending wide around  A tow'ring wood with crowding leaves imbrown'd  Beneath whose vast display of deadly shade  Her listless length lethargic EUROPE laid  There Superstition her deep plan design'd  Against the awful sanctuary of the mind  There the wan sorceress haggard fiend of hell  Midst her dim orgies mutter'd the dread spell  The sun abhors to pour his radiant flood  O'er the dumb horror of the slumb'ring wood  Yet thro' the gloom of sacerdotal night  One peerless star reveals a cheerful light  Ah why in mystic strains eclipse his name  Demand O LUTHER thine unbounded fame  Advance advance thou elder son of Truth  Sublime alldaring restless ardent youth  I now behold th' enthusiastic Maid  Rushing impetuous to her fav'rite's aid  She reaches to his lips a cup of fire  Whose living drops the leaping pulse inspire  O'er each thrill'd artery entracing roll  And sublimate the highaspiring soul  Revealing now his mission from the skies  He utters to the torpid world'Arise'  The sullen forest wrapt in tenfold night  Swift thro' a thousand vistas drinks the light  Th' imprison'd tenants burst the mental tomb  While from their eyes recedes the massive gloom  The flaky clouds admit an orient ray  And laughing morn unlocks the gates of day  Prompt Apprehension sends her view around  While her bold thoughts o'erleap their former bound  And Joy proclaims throughout th' applauding earth  The hallow'd festival of Reason's birth  NOW the couch'd mind reveals its spotless eye  Weak to sustain the splendor of the sky  Till strength'ning at th' irradiating gleam  It meets unblenching Truth's refulgent beam  So when the keenlyglitt'ring darts of light  Pierce the loose film that dims the eaglet's sight  First with an ignorant and coy survey  The dazzled bird admires the stranger day  Then glancing on the sun with tow'ring gaze  Kindles his vision at the noontide blaze  NOW Science hears a voice unknown before  'Haste pilot pilot quit the drowsy shore  The fav'ring winds thy destin'd hour proclaim  Display thy sails and launch into thy fame'  MEEK Toleration heav'ndescending maid  A vernal rainbow glitt'ring o'er her head  Smooths the rough path destructive feet have trac'd  Adorns and peoples Persecution's waste  She like the FLORA of the Pagan reign  Sprinkles with roses the enamell'd plain  Bids ev'ry flow'r of ev'ry clime arise  And freely breathe its incense to the skies  SEE Superstition madd'ning at th' alarm  Extend in thunder cloath'd her threat'ning arm  But with'ring at the heart she rues the hour  That harshly severs her diminish'd pow'r  Thus as the serpent sleeping on the plain  Feels the rude pressure of the loaded wain  With apt revenge and indignation stung  She rears her crest and darts her fiery tongue  But impotent of rage her trailing wound  She languishingly sweeps along the ground"  HERE clos'd the Seraph his illustrious theme  Which on his audience flash'd conviction's beam  And now th' Enthusiast with her hand highrear'd  Express'd a look demanding to be heard  The circling Hierarchy with one acclaim  Urge her to vindicate her injur'd fame  She to their judgment fearlessly consign'd  Thus pour'd th' effusion of her glowing mind  "BOLD on a tow'ring rock with soul elate  I saw BRITANNIA sit in regal state  Around the globe she threw her vast survey  And mark'd the realms devoted to her sway  Her western clime her oriental reign  Her glory's theatre th' unbounded main  I thus address'd her'Hail immortal dame  Who highexalted crowd'st the seat of fame  Suspend the thoughts of thine imperial state  And listen to th' event that heaves with fate  A prosp'rous mother so did Heav'n ordain  Bless'd and ennobled by a numerous train  Beheld a stranger to affection's tie  Her youngest born with a disclaiming eye  And breaking loose from ev'ry moral band  Stretch'd o'er th' innocuous babe an iron hand  And hard'ning in her wrath the helpless child  Was from her presence and her thought exil'd  This little outcast lately I survey'd  As mid the flow'rets of the wild he play'd  Artless and gay himself the wilder flow'r  Bare to the with'ring heat and quenching show'r'  BRITANNIA quick return'd with loud acclaim  'O piteous infant O inhuman dame  Where where does she abide that I may dart  The shaft of death into her wolfish heart'  'TWAS then I added with indignant air  'Dismiss thy threats thy warm resentment

cried ' this flow'ret of the wild  This orphan nursling this rejected child  Mark how around his brow of virtue's mold  The signs of greatness dare ev'n now unfold  How on the vigorous eye the morning ray  Preludes the splendor of meridian day  Marvellous infant doom'd to act my plan  AMERICANUS hasten into man  O doom'd to act what Heaven's dread thought devis'd  Thou at the font of Energy baptis'd  Whose rigid waves thy conscious soul encreas'd  Myself at once the sponsor and the priest'"  'ENOUGH' th' abruptlyrising Quire exclaim  'Aspire Enthusiast to thy wonted fame  Thy virtues claims and eminence we own  Resume thy dignities ascend thy throne  Still to frail man thy daring strength impart  Still flame th' incentive seraph of his heart  And when the scenes of earth shall fade away  And man shall need no more thy active ray  Then sacred object of our praiseful theme  Bright emanation of th' eternal beam  Thou shalt regain thy native dread abode  And glow for ever in the breast of GOD'  THE END
