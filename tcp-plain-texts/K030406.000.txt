Church in the  Strand  M DCC XL  The ARGUMENT  After the  Danes  had made themselves masters of  Chippenham  the strongest city in the Kingdom of  Wessex    Alfred  was at once abandoned by all his subjects In this universal defection that Monarch found himself obliged to retire into the little isle of  Athelney  in  Somersetshire  a place then rough with woods and of difficult access There habited like a peasant he lived unknown for some time in a shepherd's cottage He is supposed to be found in this retreat by the Earl of  Devon  whose castle upon the river  Tau  was then besieged by the  Danes  Persons  ALFRED  Mr MILWARD  ELTRUDA  Mrs HORTON  HERMIT  Mr QUIN  EARL of  Devon  Mr MILLS  CORIN a shepherd  Mr SALWAY  EMMA his wife  Mrs CLIVE  A B  Soldiers Spirits  The  SCENE  represents a plain surrounded with woods On one side a cottage on the other flocks and herds in distant prospect A Hermit's cave in full view overhung with trees wild and grotesque  ALFRED A MASQUE  ACT I  SCENE I  CORIN EMMA  EMMA  SHEPHERD 'tis he Beneath yon aged oak  All on the flowery turf he lays him down  CORIN  Soft let us not disturb him Gentle EMMA  Poor tho' he be unfriended and unknown  My pity waits with reverence on his fortune  Modest of carriage and of speech most gracious  As if some saint or angel in disguise  Had grac'd our lowly cottage with his presence  He steals I know not how into the heart  And makes it pant to serve him Trust me EMMA  He is no common man  EMMA  Some lord perhaps  Or valiant chief that from our deadly foe  The haughty cruel unbelieving  Dane    Seeks shelter here  CORIN  And shelter he shall find  Who loves his country is my friend and brother  Behold him well Fair manhood in its prime  Even thro the homely russet that conceals him  Shines forth and proves him noble Seest thou EMMA  Yon western clouds The sun they strive to hide  Yet darts his beam around  EMMA  Your thought is mine  He is not what his present fortunes speak him  But ah the raging foe is all around us  We dare not keep him here  CORIN  Content thee wife  This island is of strength Nature's own hand  Hath planted round a deep defence of woods  The sounding ash the mighty oak each tree  A sheltering grove and choak'd up all between  With wild encumbrance of perplexing thorns  And horrid brakes Beyond this woody verge  Two rivers broad and rapid hem us in  Along their channel spreads the gulphy pool  And trembling quagmire whose deceitful green  Betrays the foot it tempts One path alone  Winds to this plain so roughly difficult  This single arm poor shepherd as I am  Could well dispute it with twice twenty  Danes  EMMA  Yet think my CORIN on the stern decree  Of that proud foe "Who harbours or relieves  "An  English  captain dies the death of traitors  "But who their haunts discovers shall be safe  "And high rewarded"  CORIN  Now just heaven forbid  A  British  man should ever count for gain  What villainy must earn No are we poor  Be honesty our riches Are we mean  And humbly born The true heart makes us noble  These hands can toil can sow the ground and reap  For thee and thy sweet babes Our daily labour  Is daily wealth it finds us bread and raiment  Could  Danish  gold give more  EMMA  Alas the while  That loyal faith is fled from hall and bower  To dwell with villageswains  CORIN  Ah look behold  Where like some goodly tree by wintry winds  Torn from the roots and withering our sad guest  Lies on the ground diffus'd  EMMA  I weep to see it  CORIN  Thou hast a heart sweet pity loves to dwell in  Dry up thy tears and lean on this just hope  If yet to do away his country's shame  To serve her bravely on some blest occasion  If for these ends this stranger sought our cottage  The heavenly hosts are hovering here unseen  To watch and to protect himBut oh when  My heart burns for itshall I see the hour  Of vengeance on those  Danish  infidels  That war with heaven and us  EMMA  Alas my love  These passions are not for the poor man's state  To heaven and to the rulers of the land  Leave such ambitious thoughts Be warn'd my CORIN  And think our little all depends on thee  SONG  O peace the fairest child of heaven  To whom the sylvan reign was given  The vale the fountain and the grove  With every softer scene of love  Return sweet peace and chear the weeping swain  Return with ease and pleasure in thy train  CORIN  Hush break thee offFor see our mournful guest  Has rais'd his headand lo who comes to greet him  His friend the woodman of the neighbouring dale  Whom late as yester eveningstar arose  At his request I found and hither brought  SCENE II  ALFRED Earl of DEVON  ALFRED  How long sweet heaven how long  Shall red war desolate this prostrate land  All all is lostAnd ALFRED lives to tell it  His cities laid in dust his subjects slaughter'd  Or into slaves debas'd the murderous foe  Proud and exulting in the general shame  Are these things so and He without the means  Of great revenge cast down below the hope  Of succouring those he weeps for O despair  O grief of griefs  DEVON  Old as I am my Liege  In rough war harden'd and with death familiar  These eyes have long forgot to melt with softness  But O my gracious master they have seen  Allpitying heavensuch sights of ruthless rage  Of total desolation  ALFRED  O my people  O ruin'd  England  DEVON those were blest  Who dy'd before this time Ha and those robbers  That violate the sanctity of leagues  The reverend seal of oaths that basely broke  Like nightly ruffians on the hour of peace  And stole a victory from men unarm'd  Those  Danes  enjoy their crimes Dread vengeance  Of power and justice come array'd in terrors  Thy garment red with blood thy keen fword drawn  O come and on the heads of faithless men  Pour ample retribution men whose triumph  Upbraids eternal justiceBut no more  Submission is heaven's dueI will not launch  Into that dark abyss where thought must drown  Proceed my lord on with the mournful tale  My griefs broke off  DEVON  From yonder heathcrown'd hill  This island's eastern point where in one stream  The  Thone  and  Parret  roll their blending waves  I look'd and saw the progress of the foe  As of some tempest some devouring fire  That ruins without mercy where it spreads  The riches of the year the golden grain  That liberal crown'd our plains lies trampled wide  By hostile feet or rooted up and waste  Deforms the broad highway From space to space  Far as my straining eye could shoot its beam  Trees cottages and castles smoak to heaven  In one ascending cloud But Oh for pity  That way my lord where yonder verdant height  Declining slides into a fruitful vale  Unsightly now and bare a few poor hinds  Greyhair'd and thinly clad stood and beheld  The common ravage motionless and mute  With hands to heaven uplift they stood and wept  My tears attended theirs  ALFRED  If this sad sight  Could pain thee to such anguish what must I  Their king and parent feelThou sacred shade  Of my lov'd father all ye parted spirits  Of my fam'd ancestors be men once more  To know my pangs and weep for  England  's shame  Why end I not at once this wretched being  The means are in my handBut shall a prince  Thus poorly shroud him in the grave from pain  And sense of shame The madman nay the coward  Has often dar'd the same A monarch holds  His life in trust for others I will live then  Let heaven dispose the rest  DEVON  Thricenoble ALFRED  And  England  's only hope whose virtues raise  Our frail mortality our human dust  Up to angelic splendor and perfection  With you to bear the worst of ills the spoil  Of wasteful war the loss of life or freedom  Is happiness is glory  ALFRED  Ah look round thee  That mudbuilt cottage is thy sovereign's palace  You hind whose daily toil is all his wealth  Lodges and feeds him Are these times for flattery  Or call it praise such gaudy attributes  Would misbecome our best and proudest fortunes  But what are mine what is this highprais'd ALFRED  Among ten thousand wretches most undone  That prince who sees his country laid in ruins  His subjects perishing beneath the sword  Of foreign rage who sees and cannot save them  Is but supreme in misery  DEVON  My Liege  Who has not known ill fortune never knew  Himself or his own virtue Be of comfort  We can but die at last Till that hour comes  Let noble anger keep our hopes alive  A sudden thought as if from heaven inspir'd  Darts on my soul One castle still is ours  Tho close begirt and shaken by the  Danes  In this disguise my chance of passing on  Of entering there unknown is promising  And wears a lucky face 'Tis our last stake  And I will play it like a man whose life  Whose honor hangs upon a single cast  Mean while my Lord  ALFRED  Ha DEVON thou hast rous'd  My slumbering virtue I applaud thy thought  The praise of this brave daring shall be thine  The danger shall be common We will both  Strait tempt the  Danish  camp and gain this fort  To animate our brothers of the war  Those  Englishmen  who yet deserve that name  And hear eternal Justice if my life  Can make atonement for them King of Kings  Accept thy willing victim On my head  Be all their woes To them be grace and mercy  Come on my noble friend  DEVON  Ah good my Liege  What fits a private valor and might grace  The simple soldier's venture would proclaim  His general's rashness You are  England  's king  Your infant children and your muchlov'd queen  Nay more the public weal ten thousand souls  Whose hope you are whose all depends on you  Forbid this enterprize 'Tis nobler courage  To cheque this ardor to reserve your sword  For some great day of known and high import  That to your country to the judging world  Shall justify all hazards you may run  This trial suits but me  ALFRED  Stay thee rash man  Despair and indignation wing his steps  May that good angel who inspir'd thy thought  Throw round thy steps a veil of cloudy air  That thou mayst walk invisible and safe  Now for reflectionHa this sylvan scene  The broad wild umbrage of these pendant shades  That murmur in the breeze and deep embrown  As evening spreads the holy Hermit's cave  These scenes that musing Melancholy loves  Breathe their still influence on me O blest lot  Of calm obscurityBut list Ha whence  These airborn notes that sound in measur'd sweetness  Thro this vast silence  SCENE III  Solemn music is heard at a distance It comes nearer in a full symphony after which a single trumpet sounds a high and awakening air Then the following stanzas are sung by two aërial spirits unseen  First SPIRIT  Hear  ALFRED  father of the state  Thy Genius heaven's high will declare  What proves the hero truly great  Is never never to despair  Is never to despair  Second SPIRIT  Thy hope awake thy heart expand  With all its vigor all its fires  Arise and save a sinking land  Thy country calls and heaven inspires  Both SPIRITS  Earth calls and heaven inspires  SCENE IV  ALFRED alone  All hail ye gentle ministers of heaven  Your song inspires new patience thro my breast  And generous hope it wings my mounting soul  Above th' entangling mass of earthly passions  That keep frail man tho struggling to be free  Still fluttering in the dust  SCENE V  ALFRED the HERMIT advancing from his cave  ALFRED  Thricehappy Hermit  Whom thus the heavenly habitants attend  Blessing thy calm retreat while ruthless war  Fills the polluted land with blood and crimes  In this extremity of  England  's fate  Led by thy sacred character I come  For comfort and advice Thy aged wisdom  Purg'd from the stormy cloud of human passions  And by a ray from heaven exalted sees  Deep thro' futurity Say what remains  What yet remains to save our prostrate country  Nor scorn this anxious question even from me  A nameless stranger  HERMIT  ALFRED  England  's king  All hail and welcome to this humble cell  ALFRED  Whence dost thou know me venerable father  HERMIT  Last night when with a draught from that cool fountain  I had my wholesome sober supper crown'd  As is my stated custom forth I walk'd  Beneath the solemn gloom and glittering sky  To feed my soul with prayer and meditation  And thus to inward harmony compos'd  That sweetest music of the grateful heart  Whose each emotion is a silent hymn  I to my couch retir'd Strait on mine eyes  A pleasing slumber fell whose mystic power  Seal'd up my senses but enlarg'd my soul  At once disclos'd amid the dark waste night  A vision to my phantasy appear'd  For know this ample element contains  Unnumber'd spiritual beings or malign  Or good to man These when the grosser eye  Of nature sleeps oft play their several parts  As on a scene before th' attentive mind  And to the favour'd man disclose the future  Led by these spirits friendly to this isle  I liv'd thro' future ages felt the virtue  The great the glorious passions that will fire  Distant posterity when guardian laws  Are by the patriot in the glowing senate  Won from corruption when th' impatient arm  Of liberty invincible shall scourge  The tyrants of mankindand when the Deep  Through all her swelling waves shall proudly joy  Beneath the boundless empire of thy sons  I saw thee ALFRED tooBut o'er thy fortunes  Lay cloud  impenetrable  ALFRED  Ah good Hermit  That scene is dark indeed Ye awful powers  To what am I reserv'd Still must I roam  A wanderer here inglorious and unknown  Or am I destin'd thy great instrument  From fierce oppression to redeem this land  HERMIT  Perhaps the lastBut prince remember then  The vows the noble uses of affliction  Preserve the quick humanity it gives  The pitying social sense of human weakness  Yet keep thy stubborn fortitude entire  The manly heart that to another's woe  Is tender but superior to its own  Learn to submit yet learn to conquer fortune  Attach thee firmly to the virtuous deeds  And offices of life to life itself  With all its vain and transient joys sit loose  Chief let devotion to the sovereign mind  A steady chearful absolute dependance  On his best wisest government possess thee  In thoughtless gay prosperity when all  Attends our wish when nought is seen around us  But kneeling flattery and obedient fortune  Then are blind mortals apt within themselves  To fix their stay forgetful of the giver  But when thus humbled ALFRED as thou art  When to their feeble natural powers reduc'd  'Tis then they feel this universal truth  That heaven is all in alland man is nothing  ALFRED  I thank thee father for thy pious counsel  And witness thou dread power who seest my heart  That if not to perform my regal task  To be the common father of my people  Patron of honor virtue and religion  If not to shelter industry to guard  His honest portion from oppressive pride  From wastful riot and the sons of rapine  Who basely ravish what they dare not earn  If not to deal out justice like the sun  With equal light if not to spread thy bounty  The treasures trusted to me not my own  On all the smiling ranks of nourish'd life  If not to raise our drooping  English  name  To clothe it yet with terror make this land  Renown'd for peaceful arts to bless mankind  And generous war to humble proud oppressors  If not to build on an eternal base  On liberty and laws the public weal  If not for these great ends I am ordain'd  May I ne'er idly sill the throne of  England  HERMIT  Still may thy breast these sentiments retain  In prosperous life  ALFRED  Prosperity were ruin  Could it destroy or change such thoughts as these  When Those whom heaven distinguishes o'er millions  Prosusing on them honors riches power  Whate'er th' expanded heart can wish when they  Accepting the reward neglect the duty  Or worse pervert these gifts to deeds of ruin  Is there a wretch they rule so mean as they  Guilty at once of sacrilege to heaven  And of perfidious robbery to men  But hark methinks I hear a plaintive voice  Sigh thro the vale and wake the mournful echo  SONG    Sweet valley say where pensive lying  For me our children  England  sighing  The best of mortals leans his head  Ye fountains dimpled by my sorrow  Ye brooks that my complainings borrow  O lead me to his lonely bed  Or if my lover  Deep woods you cover  Ah whisper where your shadows o'er him spread    'Tis not the loss of pomp and pleasure  Of empire or of tinsel treasure  That drops this tear that swells this groan  No from a nobler cause proceeding  A heart with love and fondness bleeding  I breathe my sadlypleasing moan  With other anguish  I scorn to languish  For Love will feel no sorrows but his own  SCENE VI  ALFRED HERMIT ELTRUDA advancing  ALFRED  Sure by the voice and purport of the song  This generous mourner is my queen ELTRUDA  And yet how can that beO all good powers  'Tis she 'tis she  ELTRUDA  My lord my life my ALFRED  Oh take me to thy arms with toil o'ercome  And sudden transport thus at once to find thee  In this wild forest pathless and perplext  ALFRED  Come to my soul thou dearest best of women  Come and repose thy sorrows in my bosom  O all my passions mix in doubtful strife  If pain or joy prevail I scarce can say  While thus I clasp thee yet recall the perils  To which thy trembling steps have been expos'd  Why hast thou left the convent where I plac'd thee  Why unprotected trust thee to a land  A barbarous land where rages  Danish  war  Our hospitable  England  is no more  ELTRUDA  Dire was the cause my ALFRED The rous'd country  All hurl'd in breathless terror and confusion  Inform'd us a near party of the  Danes    Whose brutal fury spares no sex no age  No place however privileg'd or holy  Were on full march that way Instant I fled  In this disguise with only these attendants  But in our way oft chear'd by airy voices  To bear to this retreat our helpless children  ALFRED  Ah wanderers too young ah hapless children  But more unhappy Sire who cannot give  To those he loves protection  ELTRUDA  Thou too ALFRED  Art thou not unattended None to serve thee  To soothe thy woes to watch thy broken slumbers  And when the silent tear o'erflows thy eye  None with the warm and cordial lip of love  To kiss it off There is in love a power  There is a soft divinity that draws  Even transport from distress that gives the heart  A certain pang excelling far the joys  Of gross unfeeling life Besides my ALFRED  Even had the fury of this barbarous foe  Not forc'd me from the convent life is short  And now it trembles on the wing of danger  Why should we lose it then One wellfav'd hour  In such a tender circumstance to lovers  Is better than an age of common time  ALFRED  Oh 'tis too much thy tenderness o'ercomes me  Nay look not on me with that sweet dejection  Thro tears that pierce my soulChear thee my love  Hope still the best that better days await us  And fairer from remembranceThou ELTRUDA  Thou art a pledge of happinessOn thee  Good angels wait they led thy journey hither  And I have heard them in this wild retreat  Warbling immortal airs and strains of comfort  But ah the foe is round us and this isle  Now holds my soul's best wealth the treasur'd store  Of all my joysI go to skirt it round  To visit every creek and sedgy bank  Where rustles thro the reeds the shadowy gale  Or where the bending umbrage drinks the stream  And now by slow degrees solemn and sad  Widefalling o'er the world the nightly shades  Hush the brown woods and deepen all their horrors  While humbled into rest and aw'd by darkness  Each creature seeks the covert To that cell  Retire my life I will not long be absent  End of the first Act  ACT II  SCENE I  ALFRED alone  'TIS now the depth of darkness and repose  Nowwalksmute  Midnight  shadowy o'er the plain  To rule the solitary hour and sheds  His slumbery influence o'er the peaceful world  All nature seems to rest while ALFRED wakes  To think and to be wretchedMy brave friend  I fear me has miscarry'dWhere yon oak  With wide and dusky shade o'erhangs the stream  That glides in silence by I took my stand  What time the glowworm thro' the dewy path  First shot his twinkling flame Attent I stood  Listening each noise from twilight hill and dale  But all was hush'd around Nor trumpet's clang  Nor shout of roving foe nor hasty tread  Of evening passenger disturb'd the wide  And awful stillness Homeward as I sped  O'er many a delve thro many a path perplext  Maze running into maze illboding thoughts  Haunted my stepsPerhaps my gallant friend  Discover'd to the  Danes  this moment bleeds  Beneath their swords or lies a breathless corse  The prey of midnight wolvesSome mournful sound  Struck sudden on my sense  SCENE II  ALFRED ELTRUDA  ELTRUDA  Here will I lean  On this green bank to wait the wish'd return  Of morning and my lord  ALFRED  My gentle love  ELTRUDA why to this untimely sky  Expose thy health The dews of night fall fast  The chill breeze sighs aloud  ELTRUDA  I could not rest  Can Love repose when Apprehension wakes  And whispers to the heart all fearful things  That walk with night and solitude Methought  In each deaf murmur of the woods I heard  The dreadful foeor heard my ALFRED groan  Our tender insants tootheir fancy'd cries  Still sound within my cars  ALFRED  ELTRUDA there  I am a woman too I who should cheer  And shelter thee from every care My children  The thought of what may chance to them compleat  Their father's sum of woes O what safe shade  Can skreen their opening blossom from the storm  That beats severe on us Not sweeter buds  The primrose in the vale nor sooner shrinks  At winter's churlish blast  ELTRUDA  Behold my Lord  Good Angels shield usWhat a flood of brightness  Waves round our heads  ALFRED  The Hermit moves this way  That wondrous man holds converse with the host  Of higher natures These farbeaming fires  Were doubtless kindled up at his command  Be silent and attentive  SCENE III  ALFRED ELTRUDA HERMIT  HERMIT  I have heard  Thy fond complainings ALFRED  ALFRED  You have then  Good father heard the cause that wrings them from me  HERMIT  The human race are sons of sorrow born  And each must have his portion Vulgar minds  Refuse or crouch beneath their load the Brave  Bear theirs without repining  ALFRED  Who can bear  The shaft that wounds him thro an infant's side  When whom we love to whom we owe protection  Implore the hand we cannot reach to save them  HERMIT  Weep not ELTRUDAYet thou art a King  All private passions fall before that name  Thy subjects claim thee whole  ALFRED  Can public trust  O reverend sage destroy the softer ties  That twine around the parent's yearning heart  That holy passion heaven itself infus'd  And blended with the stream that feeds our life  HERMIT  You love your children Prince  ALFRED  Lives there on earth  In air or ocean creature tame or wild  That has not known this universal love  All nature feels it intimate and deep  And all her sons of instinct or of reason  HERMIT  Then shew that passion in its noblest form▪  Season their tender years with every virtue  Social or selfretir'd of public greatness  Or lovely in the hour of private life  With all that can exalt or can adorn  Their princely rank  ALFRED  Alas their hope must stoop  Such my unhappy fate to humbler aims  Affliction and base want must be their teachers  HERMIT  Affliction is the wholesome soil of virtue  Where patience honor sweet humanity  Calm fortitude take root and strongly flourish  But prosperous fortune that allures with pleasure  Dazles with pomp and undermines with flattery  Poisons the soil and its best product kills  Should'st thou regain thy throne  ALFRED  My throne What glimpse  What smallest ray of hope  HERMIT  That day may come  What do I feel My labouring breast expands  To give the glorious inspiration room  And now the cloud that o'er thy future fate  Like total night lay heavy and obscure  Fades into air and all the brightening scene  Dawns gay before me A long line of kings  From thee descending glorious and renown'd  In shadowy pomp I see  Genius of  England  hovering near  In all thy radiant charms appear  O come and summon from the world unknown  Those mighty chiefs those sons of future fame  Who ages hence this island shall renown  And spread to distant realms her dreaded name  Slow let the visionary forms arise  And solemn pass before our wondring eyes  Music grand and awful The Genius descending sings the following  SONG  From those eternal regions bright  Where suns that never set in night  Diffuse the golden day  Where spring unfading pours around  O'er all the dewimpearled ground  Her thousand colors gay  O whether on the fountain's flowery side  Whence living waters glide  Or in the fragrant grove  Whose shade embosoms peace and love▪  New pleasures all your hours employ  And rapture every sense with every joy  Great heirs of empire yet unborn  Who shall this island late adorn  A monarch's drooping thought to chear  Appear appear appear  Spirits of EDWARD III PHILIPPA his queen and the  Black Prince  his son arise  HERMIT  ALFRED look and say  What seest thou yonder  ALFRED  Three majestic shapes  Two habited like mighty warriors old  A third in whose bright aspect beauty smiles  More soft and feminine A lucid veil  From her fair neck dependent floats around  Lighthovering in the gale  HERMIT  O ALFRED man  Belov'd of heaven behold a King  indeed    Matchless in arms in arts of peaceful rule  A sovereign's truest glory yet more fam'd  England  's third EDWARDAt his fear'd approach  Proud  France  even now thro all her dukedoms quakes▪  Her Genius sighs and from th' eternal shore  The soul of her great CHARLES a recent guest  Looks back to earth and mourns the distant woes  His realms are doom'd to feel from EDWARD'S wrath  Beneath his standard  Britain  shall go forth  Array'd for conquest terrible in glory  And nations shrink before her O what deaths  What desolation shall her vengeance spread  From engines yet unfound whose lightnings flash  Whose thunders roar amazing o'er the plain  As if this King had summon'd from on high  Heaven's dread artillery to fight his battle  Nor is renown in war his sole ambition  A nobler passion labours in his breast  ALFRED attendto make his people blest  The sacred rights that Reason loudly claims  For freeborn menthese ALFRED are his care  Oft to confirm and fix them on the base  Of equal lawsO father of mankind  Successive praises from a grateful land  Shall saint thy name for ever  ALFRED  Holy sage  Whom angels thus enlighten and inspire  My bosom kindles at thy heavenborn flame  Great EDWARD Be thy conquests and their praise  Unrival'd to thy self But O thy fame  For care paternal of the public weal  For  England  blest at homemy rapt heart pants  To equal that renown  HERMIT  Know farther ALFRED  A sovereign's great example forms a people  The public breast is noble or is vile  As he inspires it In this EDWARD'S time  Warm'd by his courage by his honor rais'd  High flames the  British  spirit like the sun  To shine o'er half the globe and where it shines  The cherish'd world to brighten and enrich  Last see this monarch in his hour of leisure  Even social on a throne and tasting joys  To solitary greatness seldom known  As friend as husband and as father blest  That godlike  Youth  remark his eldest hope  Who gives new lustre to the name he bears  A hero ere a manI see him now  On  Cressy  's glorious plain The father's heart  With anxious love and wonder at his daring  Beats high in mingled transport Great himself  Great above  jealousy  the guilty mark  That brands all meaner minds see he applauds  The  filial excellence  and gives him scope  To blaze in his full brightnessLo again  He sends him dreadful to a nobler field  The danger and the glory all his own  A  captive King  the rival of his arms  I see adorn his triumph Heaven what grace  What splendor from his gracious temper mild  That triumph draws As gentle Mercy kind  He chears the hostile prince whose fall he weeps  ALFRED  A son so rich in virtues and so grac'd  With all that gives those virtues fair to shine  When I would ask of heaven some mighty boon  Should claim the foremost place  HERMIT  Remember then  What to thy infant sons from thee is due  As parent and as prince  ELTRUDA  Forgive me Hermit  Forgive a queen and wife her anxious fondness  Yon beauteous shade that as I gaze her o'er  My wonder draws escapes your graver thought  HERMIT  O bright ELTRUDA thou whose blooming youth  Whose amiable sweetness promise blessings  To ALFRED and to  England  see and mark  In yonder pleasing form the best of wives  The happiest too repaid with all the faith  With all the friendship love and duty claim  She powerful o'er the heart her charms enslave  O virtue rarely practis'duses nobly  That happy influence to prompt each purpose  Fair honor kindles in her EDWARD'S breast  Amid the pomps the pleasures of a court  Humble of heart severly good the friend  Of modest worth the parent of the poor  ELTRUDA O transmit these noblest charms  To that fair  daughter  that unfolding rose  With which  as on this day  heaven crown'd your loves  The spirit of ELIZABETH arises  ALFRED  Say who is she in whom the noble graces  Th' engaging manner dignity and ease  Are join'd with manly sense and resolution  HERMIT  The great ELIZA She amid a world  That threatning swells in high commotion round her  Each dangerous state her unrelenting foe  And chief a proud enormous empire stretch'd  O'er half mankind with not one friendly power  But what her kind creating hand shall raise  From out the marshes of the branching  Rhine    And min'd at home her evertottering throne  By restless bigots who beneath the mask  Of mild religion are to every crime  Set loose the faithless sons of barbarous zeal  Yet she shall crown this happy isle with peace  With arts with riches grandeur and renown  And dash by turns the madness of her foes  As when the winds from different quarters urge  The tempest on our shore secure the cliffs  Repel its idle rage and pour it back  In broken billows foaming to the main  ALFRED  How shall she Hermit gain these glorious ends  HERMIT  By silent wisdom whose informing power  Works unperceiv'd that seems in council slow  But when resolv'd and ripe for execution  That parts like lightning from the secret gloom  By ever seizing the right  point  of view  Her truest interest which she firm pursues  With steady patience thro the maze of state  The storm of opposition the mixt views  And thwarting manag'd passions of mankind  By healing the divisions of her people  And sowing that fell pest among her soes  By saving from the vermin of a court  Her treasure which when fair occasion calls  She knows to lavish in protecting arts  In guarding nations and in nursing states  By calling up to power and public life  Each virtue each ability yet  she    Amid the various worthies glowing round her  Still shines the first the central sun that wakes  That rules their every motion not the slave  And passive property of her own creatures  But the great soul that animates her reign  That lights it to perfection is the love  The confidence unbounded which her wisdom  Her probity and justice shall inspire  Into the public breast Hence cordial faith  Which nought can shake hence unexhausted treasure  And hence above all mercenary force  The hand that by the freeborn heart is rais'd  And guards the blended weal of prince and people  She too shall rouse  Britannia  's naval soul  Shall greatly ravish from insulting  Spain    The worldcommanding scepter of the deep  ELTRUDA  O matchless queen O glory of her sex  The great idea father fills my soul  And bids it glow beyond a woman's passions  Spirit of WILLIAM III arises  HERMIT  Once more O ALFRED raise thine eyes and mark  Who next adorns the scene yon laurel'd  shade  Ere yet the age that clos'd this female reign  Hath led around its train of circling years  Shall  Britain  on the verge of ruin stand  A  monarch  lost to greatness to renown  The slave of dreaming monks shall fill her throne  Weak and aspiring fond of lawless rule  The lawless rule his mean ambition covets  Unequal to acquire Yon prince thou saw'st  To glory tutor'd by the hand severe  Of sharp Adversity shall heaven upraise  And injur'd nations with joint call invoke  Their last their only refuge Lo he comes  Wide o'er the billows of the boundless deep  His navy rides triumphant and the shores  Of shouting  Albion  echo with his name  Immortal WILLIAM from before his face  Flies Superstition flies oppressive Power  With vile Servility that crouch'd and kiss'd  The whip he trembled at From this great hour  Shall  Britain  date her rights and laws restor'd  And one high purpose rule her sovereign's heart  To scourge the pride of  France  that foe profess'd  To  England  and to freedom Yet I see  From distant climes in peaceful triumph borne  Another KING arise His early youth  With living laurel crown'd for deeds of arms  That Reason's voice approves for courage rais'd  Beyond all aid from passion greatly calm  Intrepidly sereneIn days of peace  Around his throne the human virtues wait  And fair adorn him with their mildest beams  Good without show above ambition great  Wise equal merciful the friend of man  O ALFRED should thy fate long ages hence  In meaning scenes recall'd exalt the joy  Of some glad festal day before a  prince  Sprung from that king belov'dHear gracious heaven  Thy soft humanity thy patriot heart  Thy manly virtue steddy great resolv'd  Be his supreme ambition and with these  The happiness the glory that await  Thy better daysbe shower'd upon his head  ALFRED  O Hermit thou hast rais'd me to new life  New hopes new triumphs swell my bounding heart  HERMIT  It comes it comesThe promis'd scene discloses  Already the great work of fate begins  The mighty wheels are turning whence will spread  Beyond the limits of our narrow world  The fair dominions ALFRED of thy sons  Behold the warrior bright with  Danish  spoils  The  raven  droops his wingsand hark the trumpet  Exulting speaks the rest  SCENE IV  Symphony of martial music  ALFRED ELTRUDA HERMIT Earl of DEVON followed by soldiers  ALFRED  Welcome my lord  I see true courage lags not in its course  It stands not weighing actions with cold wisdom  That borders near on cowardice  DEVON  My Liege  Your troops have been successfulBut to heaven  Ascend the praise For sure th'event exceeds  The hand of man  ALFRED  How was it noble DEVON  DEVON  You know my castle is not hence fardistant  Thither I sped and in a  Danish  habit  The trenches passing by a secret way  Known to myself alone emerg'd at once  Amid my joyful soldiers There I found  A generous few the veteran hardy gleanings  Of many a hapless fight They with a fierce  And gloomy joy inspirited each other  Resolv'd on death disdaining to survive  Their dearest country"If we fall I cry'd  "Let us not tamely fall like passive cowards  "No let us liveor let us die like men  "Come on my friends to ALFRED we will cut  "Our glorious way or as we nobly perish  "Will offer to the genius of our country  "Whole hecatombs of  Danes  "As if one soul  Had mov'd them all around their heads they flash'd  Their flaming faulchions"Lead us to these  Danes    "Our countryvengeance" was the general cry  Strait on the careless drousy camp we rush'd  And rapid as the flame devours the stubble  Bore down the heartless  Danes  With this success  Our enterprize encreas'd Not now contented  To hew a passage thro the flying herd  We unremitting urg'd a total rout  The valiant HUBBA bites the bloody field  With twice six hundred  Danes  around him strow'd  ALFRED  My glorious friendthis action has restor'd  Our sinking countryWhat reward can equal  A deed so greatIs not yon pictur'd  Raven  Their famous magic standardEmblem fit  To speak the savage genius of the people  That oft has scatter'd on our troops dismay  And feeble consternation  DEVON  'Tis the same  Wrought by the sisters of the  Danish  king  Of furious IVAR in a midnight hour  While the sick moon at their enchanted song  Wrapt in pale tempest labour'd thro' the clouds  The  Demons  of destruction then they say  Were all abroad and mixing with the woof  Their baleful power The sisters ever sung  "Shake standard shake this ruin on our foes"  HERMIT  So these infernal powers with rays of truth  Still deck their fables to delude who trust them  ALFRED  But where my noble cousin are the rest  Of your brave troops  DEVON  On t'other side the stream  That half encloses this retreat I left them  Rous'd from the fear with which it was congeal'd  As in a frost the country pours amain  The spirit of our ancestors is up  The spirit of the Free and with a voice  That breathes success they all demand their king  ALFRED  Quick let us join them and improve their ardor  We cannot be too hasty to secure  The glances of occasion  SCENE the last  To them CORIN EMMA kneeling to ALFRED  CORIN  Good my Liege  Pardon the poor unequal entertainment  Which we unknowing  ALFRED  Rise my honest shepherd  I came to thee a peasant not a prince  And what exalts a king o'er other men  Stript of the toys of royalty Yet more  Thy rural entertainment was sincere  Plain hospitable kind such as I hope  Will ever mark the manners of this nation  You friendly lodg'd me when by all deserted  And shall have ample recompense  CORIN  One boon  Is all I crave  ALFRED  Good shepherd speak thy wish  CORIN  Permission in your wars to serve your Grace  For tho here lost in solitary shades  A simple swain I bear an  English  heart  A heart that burns with rage to see those  Danes    Those foreign ruffians those inhuman pirates  Oft our inferiors prov'd thus lord it o'er us  ALFRED  Brave countryman come on 'Tis such as thou  Who from affection serve and freeborn zeal  To guard whate'er is dear and sacred to them  That are a king's best honor and defence  EMMA sings the following song    If those who live in shepherd's bower  Press not the rich and stately bed  The newmown hay and breathing flower  A softer couch beneath them spread    If those who sit at shepherd's board  Soothe not their taste by wanton art  They take what Nature's gifts afford  And take it with a chearful heart    If those who drain the shepherd's bowl  No high and sparkling wines can boast  With wholesome cups they chear the soul  And crown them with the village toast    If those who join in shepherd's sport  Gaydancing on the daizy'd ground  Have not the splendor of a court  Yet Love adorns the merry round  ALFRED  My lov'd ELTRUDA thou shalt here remain  With gentle EMMA and this reverend Hermit  Ye silver streams that murmuring wind around  This dusky spot to you I trust my all  O close around her woods for her ye vales  Throw forth your flowers your softest lap diffuse  And  Thou  whose secret and expansive hand  Moves all the springs of this vast universe  Whose government astonishes who here  In a few hours beyond our utmost hope  Beyond our thought yet doubting hast clear'd up  The storm of fate preserve what thy kind will  Thy bountiful appointment makes so dear  To human hearts preserve my queen and children  Preserve the hopes of  England  while I go  To finish thy great work and save my country  ELTRUDA  Go pay the debt of honor to the public  If ever woman ALFRED lov'd her husband  More fondly than herself I claim that virtue  That heartfelt happiness Yet by our loves  I swear that in a glorious death with thee  I rather would be wrapt than live long years  To charm thee from the rugged paths of honor  So much I think thee born for beauteous deeds  And the bright course of glory  ALFRED  Matchless woman  Love at thy voice is kindled to ambition  Be this my dearest triumph to approve me  A husband worthy of the best ELTRUDA  HERMIT  Behold my Lord our venerable Bard  Aged and blind him whom the Muses favour  Yet ere you go in our lov'd country's praise  That noblest theme hear what his rapture breathes  An ODE    When  Britain  first at heaven's command  Arose from out the azure main  This  was the charter of the land  And guardian Angels sung  this  strain  "Rule  Britannia  rule the waves  "  Britons  never will be slaves"    The nations not so blest as thee  Must in their turns to tyrants fall  While thou shalt flourish great and free  The dread and envy of them all  "Rule c    Still more majestic shalt thou rise  More dreadful from each foreign stroke  As the loud blast that tears the skies  Serves but to root thy native oak  "Rule c    Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame  All their attempts to bend thee down  Will but arrouse thy generous flame  But work their woe and thy renown  "Rule c    To thee belongs the rural reign  Thy cities shall with commerce shine  All thine shall be the subject main  And every shore it circles thine  "Rule c    The Muses still with freedom found  Shall to thy happy coast repair  Blest isle with matchless beauty crown'd  And manly hearts to guard the fair  "Rule  Britannia  rule the waves  "  Britons  never will be slaves  HERMIT  ALFRED go forth lead on the radiant years  To thee reveal'd in visionLo they rise  Lo patriots heroes sages croud to birth  And bards to sing them in immortal verse  I see thy commerce  Britain  grasp the world  All nations serve thee every foreign flood  Subjected pays its tribute to the  Thames  Thither the golden South obedient pours  His sunny treasures thither the soft East  Her spices delicacies gentle gifts  And thither his rough trade the stormy North  See where beyond the vast  Atlantic  surge  By boldest keels untouch'd a dreadful space  Shores yet unfound arise in youthful prime  With towering forests mighty rivers crown'd  These stoop to  Britain  's thunder This new world  Shook to its centre trembles at her name  And there her sons with aim exalted sow  The seeds of rising empire arts and arms  Britons  proceed the subject Deep command  Awe with your navies every hostile land  In vain their threats their armies all in vain  They rule the balanc'd world who rule the main  The END
