 GRAY'S POEMS  POEMS BY Mr GRAY A NEW EDITION  LONDON Printed for J DODSLEY in Pallmall M DCC LXVIII  ODE ON THE SPRING  ODE  LO where the rosybosom'd Hours  Fair VENUS' train appear  Disclose the longexpecting flowers  And wake the purple year  The Attic warbler pours her throat  Responsive to the cuckow's note  The untaught harmony of spring  While whisp'ring pleasure as they fly  Cool Zephyrs thro' the clear blue sky  Their gather'd fragrance fling  Where'er the oak's thick branches stretch  A broader browner shade  Where'er the rude and mossgrown beech  O'ercanopies the glade  a bank  O'ercanopied with luscious woodbine  Shakesp Mids Night's Dream    Beside some water's rushy brink  With me the Muse shall sit and think  At ease reclin'd in rustic state  How vain the ardour of the Crowd  How low how little are the Proud  How indigent the Great  Still is the toiling hand of Care  The panting herds repose  Yet hark how thro' the peopled air  The busy murmur glows  The infect youth are on the wing  Eager to taste the honied spring  And float amid the liquid noon  "Nare per aestatem liquidam"  Virgil Georg lib    Some lightly o'er the current skim  Some shew their gaylygilded trim  Quickglancing to the sun  sporting with quick glance  Shew to the sun their waved coats drop'd with gold  Milton's Paradise Lost book    To Contemplation's sober eye  While insects from the threshold preach c  M GREEN  in the Grotto Dodsley's Miscellanies Vol  V p  Such is the race of Man  And they that creep and they that fly  Shall end where they began  Alike the Busy and the Gay  But flutter thro' life's little day  In fortune's varying colours drest  Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance  Or chill'd by age their airy dance  They leave in dust to rest  Methinks I hear in accents low  The sportive kind reply  Poor moralist and what art thou  A solitary fly  Thy Joys no glittering female meets  No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets  No painted plumage to display  On hasty wings thy youth is flown  Thy sun is set thy spring is gone  We frolick while 'tis May  ON THE DEATH OF A FAVOURITE CAT Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes  ON THE DEATH OF A FAVOURITE CAT Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes  'T WAS on a lofty vase's side  Where China's gayest art had dy'd  The azure flowers that blow  Demurest of the tabby kind  The pensive Selima reclin'd  Gazed on the lake below  Her conscious tail her joy declar'd  The fair round face the snowy beard  The velvet of her paws  Her coat that with the tortoise vies  Her ears of jet and emerald eyes  She saw and purr'd applause  Still had she gaz'd but 'midst the tide  Two angel forms were seen to glide  The Genii of the stream  Their scaly armour's Tyrian hue  Thro' richest purple to the view  Betray'd a golden gleam  The hapless Nymph with wonder saw  A whisker first and then a claw  With many an ardent wish  She stretch'd in vain to reach the prize  What female heart can gold despise  What Cat's averse to fish  Presumptuous Maid with looks intent  Again she stretch'd again she bent  Nor knew the gulf between  Malignant Fate sat by and smil'd  The slipp'ry verge her feet beguil'd  She tumbled headlong in  Eight times emerging from the flood  She mew'd to ev'ry wat'ry God  Some speedy aid to send  No Dolphin came no Nereid stirr'd  Nor cruel  Tom  nor  Susan  heard  A Fav'rite has no friend  From hence ye Beauties undeceiv'd  Know one false step is ne'er retriev'd  And be with caution bold  Not all that tempts your wand'ring eyes  And heedless hearts is lawful prize  Nor all that glisters gold  ODE ON A DISTANT PROSPECT OF ETON COLLEGE    MENANDER  ON A DISTANT PROSPECT OF ETON COLLEGE  YE distant spires ye antique towers  That crown the watry glade  Where grateful Science still adores  Her HENRY'S  King HENRY the Sixth Founder of the College  holy Shade  And ye that from the stately brow  Of WINDSOR'S heights th' expanse below  Of grove of lawn of mead survey  Whose turf whose shade whose flowers among  Wanders the hoary Thames along  His silverwinding way  Ah happy hills ah pleasing shade  Ah fields belov'd in vain  Where once my careless childhood stray'd  A stranger yet to pain  I feel the gales that from ye blow  A momentary bliss bestow  As waving fresh their gladsome wing  My weary soul they seem to sooth  And  And bees their honey redolent of spring  Dryden's Fable on the Pythag System  redolent of joy and youth  To breathe a second spring  Say Father THAMES for thou hast seen  Full many a sprightly race  Disporting on thy margent green  The paths of pleasure trace  Who foremost now delight to cleave  With pliant arm thy glassy wave  The captive linnet which enthrall  What idle progeny succeed  To chase the rolling circle's speed  Or urge the flying ball  While some on earnest business bent  Their murm'ring labours ply  'Gainst graver hours that bring constraint  To sweeten liberty  Some bold adventurers disdain  The limits of their little reign  And unknown regions dare descry  Still as they run they look behind  They hear a voice in every wind  And snatch a fearful joy  Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed  Less pleasing when possest  The tear forgot as soon as shed  The sunshine of the breast  Theirs buxom health of rosy hue  Wild wit invention evernew  And lively chear of vigour born  The thoughtless day the easy night  The spirits pure the slumbers light  That fly th' approach of morn  Alas regardless of their doom  The little victims play  No sense have they of ills to come  Nor care beyond today  Yet see how all around 'em wait  The Ministers of human fate  And black Misfortune's baleful train  Ah shew them where in ambush stand  To seize their prey the murth'rous band  Ah tell them they are men  These shall the fury Passions tear  The vulturs of the mind  Disdainful Anger pallid Fear  And Shame that sculks behind  Or pineing Love shall waste their youth  Or Jealousy with rankling tooth  That inly gnaws the secret heart  And Envy wan and faded Care  Grimvisag'd comfortless Despair  And Sorrow's piercing dart  Ambition this shall tempt to rise  Then whirl the wretch from high  To bitter Scorn a sacrifice  And grinning Infamy  The stings of Falshood those shall try  And hard Unkindness' alter'd eye  That mocks the tear it forc'd to flow  And keen Remorse with blood defil'd  And moody Madness  Madness laughing in his ireful mood  Dryden's Fable of Palamon and Arcitc  laughing wild  Amid severest woe  Lo in the vale of years beneath  A griesly troop are seen  The painful family of Death  More hideous than their Queen  This racks the joints this fires the veins  That every labouring finew strains  Those in the deeper vitals rage  Lo Poverty to fill the band  That numbs the soul with icy hand  And slowconsuming Age  To each his suff'rings all are men  Condemn'd alike to groan  The tender for another's pain  Th' unfeeling for his own  Yet ah why should they know their fate  Since sorrow never comes too late  And happiness too swiftly flies  Thought would destroy their paradise  No more where ignorance is bliss  'Tis folly to be wise  HYMN TO ADVERSITY    AESCHYLUS in Agamemnone  HYMN TO ADVERSITY  DAUGHTER of JOVE relentless Power  Thou Tamer of the human breast  Whose iron scourge and tort'ring hour  The Bad affright afflict the Best  Bound in thy adamantine chain  The Proud are taught to taste of pain  And purple Tyrants vainly groan  With pangs unfelt before unpitied and alone  When first thy Sire to send on earth  Virtue his darling Child design'd  To thee he gave the heav'nly Birth  And bad to form her infant mind  Stern rugged Nurse thy rigid lore  With patience many a year she bore  What sorrow was thou bad'st her know  And from her own she learn'd to melt at others' woe  Scared at thy frown terrific fly  Selfpleasing Folly's idle brood  Wild Laughter Noise and thoughtless Joy  And leave us leisure to be good  Light they disperse and with them go  The summer Friend the flatt'ring Foe  By vain Prosperity received  To her they vow their truth and are again believed  Wisdom in sable garb array'd  Immers'd in rapt'rous thought profound  And Melancholy silent maid  With leaden eye that loves the ground  Still on thy solemn steps attend  Warm Charity the gen'ral Friend  With Justice to herself severe  And Pity dropping soft the sadlypleasing tear  Oh gently on thy Suppliant's head  Dread Goddess lay thy chast'ning hand  Not in thy Gorgon terrors clad  Nor circled with the vengeful Band  As by the Impious thou art seen  With thund'ring voice and threat'ning mien  With screaming Horror's funeral cry  Despair and fell Disease and ghastly Poverty  Thy form benign oh Goddess wear  Thy milder influence impart  Thy philosophic Train be there  To soften not to wound my heart  The gen'rous spark extinct revive  Teach me to love and to forgive  Exact my own defects to scan  What others are to feel and know myself a Man  THE PROGRESS of POESY A PINDARIC ODE  PINDAR Olymp II  ADVERTISEMENT  When the Author first published this and the following Ode he was advised even by his Friends to subjoin some few explanatory Notes but had too much respect for the understanding of his Readers to take that liberty  THE PROGRESS of POESY A PINDARIC ODE  I i  Awake my glory awake lute and harp  David's Psalms  Pindar styles his own poetry with its musical accompanyments  Aeolian song Aeolian strings the breath of the Aeolian flute  The subject and simile as usual with Pindar are united The various sources of poetry which gives life and lustre to all it touches are here described its quiet majestic progress enriching every subject otherwise dry and barren with a pomp of diction and luxuriant harmony of numbers and its more rapid and iresistible course when swoln and hurried away by the conflict of tumultuous passions  A WAKE Aeolian lyre awake  And give to rapture all thy trembling strings  From Helicon's harmonious springs  A thousand rills their mazy progress take  The laughing flowers that round them blow  Drink life and fragrance as they flow  Now the rich stream of music winds along  Deep majestic smooth and strong  Thro' verdant vales and Ceres' golden reign  Now rowling down the steep amain  Headlong impetuous see it pour  The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar  I  Power of harmony to calm the turbulent sallies of the soul The thoughts are borrowed from the first Pythian of Pindar  Oh Sovereign of the willing soul  Parent of sweet and solemnbreathing airs  Enchanting shell the sullen Cares  And frantic Passions hear thy soft controul  On Thracia's hills the Lord of War  Has curb'd the fury of his car  And drop'd his thirsty lance at thy command  This is a weak imitation of some incomparable lines in the same Ode  Perching on the scept'red hand  Of Jove thy magic lulls the feather'd king  With ruffled plumes and flagging wing  Quench'd in dark clouds of flumber lie  The terror of his beak and light'nings of his eye  I  Power of harmony to produce all the graces of motion in the body  Thee the voice the dance obey  Temper'd to thy warbled lay  O'er Idalia's velvetgreen  The rosycrowned Loves are seen  On Cytherea's day  With antic sports and blueeyed Pleasures  Frisking light in frolic measures  Now pursuing now retreating  Now in circling troops they meet  To brisk notes in cadence beating  HOMER Od O  Glance their manytwinkling feet  Slow melting strains their Queen's approach declare  Where'er she turns the Graces homage pay  With arms sublime that float upon the air  In gliding state she wins her easy way  O'er her warm cheek and rising bosom move  PHRYNICHUS apud Athenaeum  The bloom of young Desire and purple light of Love  II i  To compensate the real and imaginary ills of life the Muse was given to Mankind by the same Providence that sends the Day by its chearful presence to dispel the gloom and terrors of the Night  Man's feeble race what Ills await  Labour and Penury the racks of Pain  Disease and Sorrow's weeping train  And Death sad refuge from the storms of Fate  The fond complaint my Song disprove  And justify the laws of Jove  Say has he giv'n in vain the heav'nly Muse  Night and all her sickly dews  Her Spectres wan and Birds of boding cry  He gives to range the dreary sky  Or seen the Morning's wellappointed Star  Come marching up the eastern hills afar  Cowley  Till down the eastern cliffs afar  Hyperion's march they spy and glitt'ring shafts of war  II  Extensive influence of poetic Genius over the remotest and most uncivilized nations its connection with liberty and the virtues that naturally attend on it See the Erse Norwegian and Welch Fragments the Lapland and American songs  In climes beyond the solar  "Extra anni solisque vias"  Virgil  "Tutta lontana dal eamin del sole"  Petrarch Canzon  road  Where shaggy forms o'er icebuilt mountains roam  The Muse has broke the twilightgloom  To chear the swv'ring Native's dull abode  And oft beneath the od'rous shade  Of Chili's boundless forests laid  She deigns to hear the savage Youth repeat  In loose numbers wildly sweet  Their feathercinctured Chiefs and dusky Loves  Her track where'er the Goddess roves  Glory pursue and generous Shame  Th' unconquerable Mind and Freedom's holy flame  II  Progress of Poetry from Greece to Italy and from Italy to England Chaucer was not unacquainted with the writings of Dante or of Petrarch The Earl of Surrey and Sir Tho Wyatt had travelled in Italy and formed their taste there Spenser imitated the Italian writers Milton improved on them but this School expired soon after the Restoration and a new one arose on the French model which has subsisted ever since  Woods that wave o'er Delphi's steep  Isles that crown th' Aegean deep  Fields that cool Ilissus laves  Or where MAeander's amber waves  In lingering Lab'rinths creep  How do your tuneful Echo's languish  Mute but to the voice of Anguish  Where each old poetic Mountain  Inspiration breath'd around  Ev'ry shade and hallow'd Fountain  Murmur'd deep a solemn sound  Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hour  Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains  Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrantPower  And coward Vice that revels in her chains  When Latium had her lofty spirit lost  They sought oh Albion next thy seaencircled coast  III I  Far from the sun and summergale  In thy green lap was Nature's  Shakespear  Darling laid  What time where lucid Avon stray'd  To Him the mighty Mother did unveil  Her aweful face The dauntless Child  Stretch'd forth his little arms and smiled  This pencil take she said whose colours clear  Richly paint the vernal year  Thine too these golden keys immortal Boy  This can unlock the gates of Joy  Of Horrour that and thrilling Fears  Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic Tears  III  Nor second He  Milton  that rode sublime  Upon the seraphwings of Extasy  The secrets of th' Abyss to spy  "flammantia moenia mundi"  Lucretius  He pass'd the flaming bounds of Place and Time  For the spirit of the living creature was in the wheelsAnd above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a saphirestoneThis was the appearance of the glory of the Lord  Ezekiel i  The living Throne the saphireblaze  Where Angels tremble while they gaze  He saw but blasted with excess of light  HOMER Od  Closed his eyes in endless night  Behold where Dryden's less presumptuous car  Wide o'er the fields of Glory bear  Meant to express the stately march and sounding energy of Dryden's rhimes  Two Coursers of ethereal race  Hast thou cloathed his neck with thunder  Job  With necks in thunder cloath'd and longresounding pace  III  Hark his hands the iyte explore  Brighteyed Fancy hovering o'er  Scatters from her pictur'd urn  Words that weep and tears that speak  Cowley  Thoughts that breath and words that burn  We have had in our language no other odes of the sublime kind than that of Dryden on St Cecilia's day for Cowley who had his merit yet wanted judgment style and harmony for such a task That of Pope is not worthy of so great a man Mr Mason indeed of late days has touched the true chords and with a masterly hand in some of his Chorusesabove all in the last of Caractacus  Hark heard ye not yon footstep dread c  But ah 'tis heard no more  Oh Lyre divine what daring Spirit  Wakes thee now tho' he inherit  Nor the pride nor ample pinion  Olymp Pindar  compares himself to that bird and his enemies to ravens that croak and clamour in vain below while it pursues its flight regardless of their noise  That the Theban Eagle bear  Sailing with supreme dominion  Thro' the azure deep of air  Yet oft before his infant eyes would run  Such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray  With orient hues unborrow'd of the Sun  Yet shall he mount and keep his distant way  Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate  Beneath the Good how farbut far above the Great  THE BARD A PINDARIC ODE  ADVERTISEMENT  The following Ode is founded on a Tradition current in Wales that EDWARD THE FIRST when he compleated the conquest of that country ordered all the Bards that fell into his hands to be put to death  THE BARD A PINDARIC ODE  I I  'RUIN seize thee ruthless King  'Confusion on thy banners wait  'Tho' fann'd by Conquest's crimson wing  '  Mocking the air with colours idly spread

Conway built by King Edward the first says "Ad ortum amnis Conway ad clivum montis Erery" and Matthew of Westminster ad ann "Apud Aberconway ad pedes montis Snowdoniae fecit erigi castrum forte"

from thence as some think were named by the Welch  Craigianeryri  or the crags of the eagles At this day I am told the highest point of Snowdon is called  the eagle's nest  That bird is certainly no stranger to this island as the Scots and the people of Cumberland Westmoreland  c  can testify it even has built its nest in the Peak of Derbyshire See Willoughby's Ornithol published by Ray  Eagle

ADVERTISEMENT  The Author once had thoughts in concert with a Friend of giving  the History of English Poetry  In the Introduction to it he meant to have produced some specimens of the Style that reigned in ancient times among the neighbouring nations or those who had subdued the greater part of this Island and were our Progenitors the following three Imitations made a part of them He has long since drop'd his design especially after he had heard that it was already in the hands of a Person well qualified to do it justice both by his taste and his researches into antiquity  PREFACE  IN the Eleventh Century  Sigurd  Earl of the OrkneyIslands went with a fleet of ships and a considerable body of troops into Ireland to the assistance of  Sictryg with the silken beard  who was then making war on his fatherinlaw  Brian  King of Dublin the Earl and all his forces were cut to pieces and  Sictryg  was in danger of a total defeat but the enemy had a greater loss by the death of  Brian  their King who fell in the action On Christmasday the day of the battle a Native of  Gaithness  in Scotland saw at a distance a number of persons on horseback riding full speed towards a hill  and seeming to enter into it Curiosity led him to follow them till looking through an opening in the rocks he saw twelve gigantic figures resembling women they were all employed about a loom and as they wove they sung the following dreadful Song which when they had finished they tore the web into twelve pieces and each taking her portion galloped Six to the North and as many to the South  THE FATAL

And long pursues with fruitless yell  The Father of the powerful spell  Onward still his way he takes  The groaning earth beneath him shakes  Till full before his fearless eyes  The portals nine of hell arise  Right against the eastern gate  By the mossgrown pile he sate  Where long of yore to sleep was laid  The dust of the prophetic Maid  Facing to the northern clime  Thrice he traced the runic rhyme  Thrice pronounc'd in accents dread  The thrilling verse that wakes the Dead  Till from out the hollow ground  Slowly breath'd a sullen sound  PR What call unknown what charms presme  To break the quiet of the tomb  Who thus afflicts my troubled sprite  And drags me from the realms of night  Long on these mould'ring bones have beat  The winter's snow the summer's heat  The drenching dews and driving rain  Let me let me sleep again  Who is he with voice unblest  That calls me from the bed of rest  O A Traveller to thee unknown  Is he that calls a Warriour's Son  Thou the deeds of light shalt know  Tell me what is done below  For whom yon glitt'ring board is spread  Drest for whom yon golden bed  PR Mantling in the goblet see  The pure bev'rage of the bee  O'er it hangs the shield of gold  'Tis the drink of  Balder  bold  Balder's  head to death is giv'n  Pain can reach the Sons of Heav'n  Unwilling I my lips unclose  Leave me leave me to repose  O Once again my call obey  Prophetess arise and say  What dangers  Odin's  Child await  Who the Author of his fate  PR In  Hoder's  hand the Heroe's doom  His Brother sends him to the tomb  Now my weary lips I close  Leave me leave me to repose  O Prophetess my spell obey  Once again arise and say  Who th' Avenger of his guilt  By whom shall  Hoder's  blood be spilt  PR In the caverns of the west  By  Odin's  fierce embrace comprest  A wond'rous Boy shall  Rinda  bear  Who ne'er shall comb his ravenhair  Nor wash his visage in the stream  Nor see the sun's departing beam  Till he on  Hoder's  corse shall smile  Flaming on the fun'ral pile  Now my weary lips I close  Leave me leave me to repose  O Yet a while my call obey  Prophetess awake and say  What Virgins these in speechless woe  That bend to earth their solemn brow  That their flaxen tresses tear  And snowy veils that float in air  Tell me whence their sorrows rose  Then I leave thee to repose  PR Ha no Traveller art thou  King of Men I know thee now  Mightiest of a mighty line  O No boding Maid of skill divine  Art thou nor Prophetess of good  But mother of the giantbrood  PR Hie thee hence and boast at home  That never shall Enquirer come  To break my ironsleep again  Till  Lok  is the evil Being who continues in chains till the  Twilight of be Gods  approaches when he shall break his bonds the human race the stars and sun shall disappear the earth sink in the seas and fire consume the skies even Odin himself and his kindreddeities shall perish For a farther explanation of this mythology see Mallet's Introduction to the History of Denmark Quarto  Lok  has burst his tenfold chain  Never till substantial Night  Has reassum'd her ancient right  Till wrap'd in flames in ruin hurl'd  Sinks the fabric of the world  THE TRIUMPHS of OWEN A FRAGMENT  FROM Mr EVANS'S Specimens of the Welch Poetry LONDON Quarto  ADVERTISEMENT  OWEN succeeded his Father GRIFFIN in the Principality of NORTHWALES AD This battle was fought near forty Years afterwards  THE TRIUMPHS of OWEN A FRAGMENT  OWEN's praise demands my song  OWEN swift and OWEN strong  Fairest flower of Roderic's stem  NorthWales  Gwyneth's shield and Britain's gem  He nor heaps his brooded stores  Nor on all profusely pours  Lord of every regal art  Liberal hand and open heart  Big with hosts of mighty name  Squadrons three against him came  This the force of Eirin hiding  Side by side as proudly riding  On her shadow long and gay  Denmark  Lochlin plows the wat'ry way  There the Norman sails afar  Catch the winds and join the war  Black and huge along they sweep  Burthens of the angry deep  Dauntless on his native sands  The red Dragon is the device of Cadwallader which all his descendents bore on their banners  The DragonSon of Mona stands  In glitt'ring arms and glory drest  High he rears his ruby crest  There the thund'ring strokes begin  There the press and there the din  Talymalfra's rocky shore  Echoing to the battle's roar  Where his glowing eyeballs turn  Thousand Banners round him burn  Where he points his purple spear  Hasty hasty Rout is there  Marking with indignant eye  Fear to stop and shame to fly  There Confusion Terror's child  Conflict fierce and Ruin wild  Agony that pants for breath  Despair and honourable Death  ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD  ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD  THE Curfew tolls  squilla di lontano  Che paia'l giorno pianger che si muore  Dante Purgat I  the knell of parting day  The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea  The plowman homeward plods his weary way  And leaves the world to darkness and to me  Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight  And all the air a solemn stillness holds  Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight  And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds  Save that from yonder ivymantled tow'r  The mopeing owl does to the moon complain  Of such as wand'ring near her secret bow'r  Molest her ancient solitary reign  Beneath those rugged elms that yewtree's shade  Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap  Each in his narrow cell for ever laid  The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep  The breezy call of incensebreathing Morn  The swallow twitt'ring from the strawbuilt shed  The cock's shrill clarion or the echoing horn  No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed  For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn  Or busy housewife ply her evening care  No children run to lisp their sire's return  Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share  Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield  Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke  How jocund did they drive their team afield  How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke  Let not Ambition mock their useful toil  Their homely joys and destiny obscure  Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile  The short and simple annals of the poor  The boast of heraldry the pomp of pow'r  And all that beauty all that wealth e'er gave  Await alike th' inevitable hour  The paths of glory lead but to the grave  Nor you ye Proud impute to These the fault  If Mem'ry o'er their Tomb no Trophies raise  Where thro' the longdrawn isle and fretted vault  The pealing anthem swells the note of praise  Can storied urn or animated bust  Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath  Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust  Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold ear of Death  Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire  Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd  Or wak'd to extasy the living lyre  But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page  Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll  Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage  And froze the genial current of the soul  Full many a gem of purest ray serene  The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear  Full many a flower is born to blush unseen  And waste its sweetness on the desert air  Some villageHampden that with dauntless breast  The little Tyrant of his fields withstood  Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest  Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood  Th' applause of list'ning senates to command  The threats of pain and ruin to despise  To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land  And read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes  Their lot forbad nor circumscrib'd alone  Their growing virtues but their crimes confin'd  Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind  The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide  To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame  Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride  With incense kindled at the Muse's flame  Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray  Along the cool sequester'd vale of life  They kept the noiseless tenor of their way  Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect  Some frail memorial still erected nigh  With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd  Implores the passing tribute of a sigh  Their name their years spelt by th' unletter'd muse  The place of fame and elegy supply  And many a holy text around she strews  That teach the rustic moralist to die  For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd  Left the warm precincts of the chearful day  Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind  On some fond breast the parting soul relies  Some pious drops the closing eye requires  Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries  Ch'i veggio nel pensier dolce mio fuoco  Fredda una lingua due begli occhi chiusi  Rimaner doppo noi pien di faville  Petrarch Son    Ev'n in our Ashes live their wonted Fires  For thee who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead  Dost in these lines their artless tale relate  If chance by lonely contemplation led  Some kindred Spirit shall inquire thy fate  Haply some hoaryheaded Swain may say  'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn  'Brushing with hasty steps the dews away  'To meet the sun upon the upland lawn  'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech  'That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high  'His listless length at noontide would he stretch  'And pore upon the brook that babbles by'  'Hard by yon wood now smiling as in scorn  'Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove  'Now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn  'Or craz'd with care or cross'd in hopeless love  'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill  'Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree  'Another came nor yet beside the rill  'Nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he'  'The next with dirges due in sad array  'Slow thro' the churchway path we saw him born  'Approach and read for thou can'st read the lay  'Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn'  The EPITAPH  HERE rests his head upon the lap of Earth  A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown  Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth  And Melancholy mark'd him for her own  Large was his bounty and his soul sincere  Heav'n did a recompence as largely send  He gave to Mis'ry all he had a tear  He gain' d from Heav'n 'twas all he wish'd a friend  No farther seek his merits to disclose  Or draw his frailties from their dread abode    paventosa speme  Petrarch Son    There they alike in trembling hope repose  The bosom of his Father and his God  THE CONTENTS  PAGE  ODE on the SPRING I  ODE on the Death of a FAVOURITE CAT  ODE on a Distant Prospect of ETON COLLEGE  HYMN to ADVERSITY  The PROGRESS of POESY A
