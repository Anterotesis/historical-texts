 A TRUE CHARACTER of Mr POPE  The SECOND EDITION  SIR  _I Have read over the  Libel  which I received from you the Day before Yesterday Yesterday I received the same from another Hand with this Character of the Secret Author of so much stupid Calumny  That he is one whom God and Nature have mark'd for want of Common Honesty and his own Contemptible Rhimes for want of Common Sense that those Rhimes have found great Success with the Rabble which is a Word almost as comprehensive as Mankind but that the Town which supports him will do by him as the Dolphin did by the Shipwrack'd  Monkey  drop him as soon as it finds him out to be a Beast whom it fondly now mistakes for a Human Creature 'Tis says he a very little but very comprehensive Creature in whom all Contradictions meet and all Contrarieties are reconcil'd when at one and the same time like the Ancient  Centaurs  he is a Beast and a Man a Whig and a Tory a virulent  Papist  and yet forsooth a Pillar of the Church of  England  a Writer at one and the same time of GUARDIANS and of EXAMINERS an assertor of Liberty and of the Dispensing Power of Kings a Rhimester without Judgment or Reason and a Critick without Common Sense a Jesuitical  Professor of Truth a base and foul Pretender to Candour a Barbarous Wretch who is perpetually boasting of Humanity and Good Nature a lurking waylaying Coward and a Stabber in the Dark who is always pretending to Magnanimity and to sum up all Villains in one a TraytorFriend one who has betrayed all Mankind and seems to have taken his great Rule of Life from the following Lines of  Hudibras  For 'tis easier to  Betray  Than Ruin any other way  As the Earth is soonest undermin'd  By vermin Impotent and Blind  He is a Professor of the worst Religion which he laughs at and yet has most inviolably observ'd the most execrable Maxim in it  That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks  A Wretch whose true Religion is his Interest and yet so stupidly blind to that Interest that he often meets her without knowing her and very grosly Affronts her His Villainy is but the natural Effect of his want of Understanding as the sowerness of Vinegar proceeds from its want of Spirit and yet  says my Friend  notwithstanding that Shape and that Mind of his some Men of good Understanding value him for his Rhimes as they would be fond of an  Asseinego  that could sing his part in a Catch or of a  Baboon  that could whistle  Walsingham  The grosser part of his gentle Readers be+lieve the Beast to be more than Man as Ancient Rusticks took his Ancestors for those Demy Gods they call  Fauns  and  Satyrs  This was the Character which my Friend gave of the Author of this miserable Libel which immediately made me apprehend that it was the very same Person who endeavour'd to expose you in a  Billinsgate  Libel at the very time that you were doing him a Favour at his own earnest Desire who attempted to undermine Mr  PHILIPS  in one of his  Guardians  at the same time that the  Crocodile  smil'd on him embrac'd him and called him Friend who wrote a Prologue in praise of  CATO  and teas'd  Lintott  to publish Remarks upon it who at the same time that he openly extoll'd Sir  Richard Steele  in the highest manner secretly publish'd the Infamous Libel of Dr  Andrew Tripe  upon him who as he is in Shape a  Monkey  is so in his every Action in his senseless Chattering and his merry  Grimaces in his doing hourly Mischief and hiding himself in the variety of his Ridiculous Postures and his continual Shiftings from Place to Place from Persons to Persons from Thing to Thing But whenever he Scribbles he is emphatically a  Monkey  in his awkard servile Imitations For in all his Productions he has been an  Imitator  from his Imitation of VIRGILS  Bucolicks  to this present Imitation of HORACEHis  Pastorals  were writ in Imitation of VIRGILHis  Rape of the Lock  of BOILEAUHis  Essay on Criticism  of the present Duke of  Buckingham  and of my Lord  Rofcommon  His  WindsorForest  of Sir  John Denham  His  Ode upon St Caecilia  of Mr  Dryden  andHis  Temple of Fame  of CHAUCER  Thus for fifteen Years together this Ludicrous Animal has been a constant  Imitator  Yet he has rather mimick'd these great Genius's than he has Imitated them He has given a False and a Ridiculous Turn to all their good and their great Qualities and has as far as in him lies Burlesqu'd them without knowing it But after having been for fifteen Years as it were an  Imitator  he has made no Proficiency His first Imitations tho' bad are rather better than the Succeeding and this last Imitation of HORACE the most execrable of them all  For as a Dog that turns the Spit  Bestirs himself and plies his Feet  To climb the Wheel but all in vain  His own Weight brings him down again  And still he's in the self same place  Where at his setting out he was  So in the Circle of the Arts  Does he Advance his natural Parts  Hud  If you should chance Sir to shew this LETTER to any of your Acquaintance who have perus'd his Senseless Calumnies they may think perhaps that we follow his Example and retort Slander upon him I desire that you would have the Goodness to assure such that in the Moral part of his Character and all that relates to matter of Fact there is no manner of Rhetorick us'd all is exactly and literally true  for which we appeal to those Poetical Persons with whom we have been most conversant in  CoventGarden  We have always been of Opinion that he who invents or pretends or falsifies Matter of Fact in order to slander any one deserves an Infamous Punishment and we have always had before our Eyes the following Verses out of  Horace  Absentem qui rodit amicum  Qui non desendit alio culpante solutos  Qui captat risus Hominum famamque dicacis  Fingere qui non visa potest commissa tacere  Qui nequit hic niger est hunc tu Romani  Caveto  c  As to what relates to the  Person  of this wretched Libeller if in that there may be some trifling Exaggerations yet even that is not design'd to Deceive or Impose upon any to whom you mey happen to shew it but is intended to lead them to an exact Knowledge of the Truth by a very little enlarging upon it  But if any one appears to be concern'd at our upbraiding him with his Natural Deformity which did not come by his own Fault but seems to be the Curse of God upon him we desire that Person to consider that this little Monster has upbraided People with their Calamities and their Diseases which are either false or past or which he himself gave them by administring Poison to them we desire that Person to consider that Calamities and Diseases if they are neither false nor past are common to all Men that a Man can no more help his Calamities and his Diseases than a Monster can his Deformity that there is no Misfortune but what the Generality of Mankind are liable too and that there is no one Disease but what all the rest of Men are subject too whereas the Deformity of this Libeller is Visible Present Lasting Unalterable and Peculiar to himself 'Tis the mark of God and Nature upon him to give us warning that we should hold no Society with him as a Creature not of our Original nor of our Species And they who have refus'd to take this Warning which God and Nature have given them and have in spight of it by a senseless Presumption ventur'd to be familiar  with him have severely suffer'd for it by his Perfidiousness They tell me he has been lately pleas'd to say  That 'tis Doubtful if the Race of Men are the offspring of  Adam  or of the  The WORMS a Satire Stanza  Devil But if 'tis doubtful as to the Race of Men 'tis certain at least that his Original is not from  Adam  but from the  Devil  By his constant and malicious Lying and by that Angel Face and Form of his 'tis plain that he wants nothing but Horns and Tail to be the exact Resemblance both in Shape and Mind of his Infernal Father Thus Sir I return you Truth for Slander and a just Satire for an Extravagant Libel which is therefore ridiculously called an Imitation of  Horace  you know very well Sir that the Difference between  Horace  and such an Imitation of him is almost Infinite and I leave you to consider what Influence such an Imitation must have upon his Readers of both Kinds both upon those who are acquainted with that Great Poet and with those that know him not how contemptible it must render  Horace  to the latter and his Imitator to the former who when they shall behold the Ghost of their old and their valued Friend raised up before them by this awkard Conjurer in a Manner so ridiculously frightful when they behold him thus miserably mangled and reflect at once with Contempt and Horrour upon this Barbarous Usage of him will not be able to refrain from exclaiming in the most vehement Manner  Qualis adest Quantum mutatus ab illo  c  They must think that their old and valued Friend had a Prophetick Spirit and seem'd to foretel the Usage which he has lately received from this Barbarian and his Brethren when in the fourth Ode of his Third Book he cryed  Visam Britannos Hospitibus feros  But as for the other sorts of Readers the Readers who have no knowledge of  Horace  but from this contemptible Imitation what must they think Sir of those great Men who extol him for the second Genius of the  RomanEmpire  Illustrious for so many great Qualities which are to be sound in him  alone Must they not look upon all his Admirers as so many Learned Ideots and upon the  RomanEmpire  it self as a vast Nation of Fools  You know very well Sir that as  Horace  had a firmness of Judgment and a sureness and truth of Taste he never once form'd a wrong Judgment to himself either of the Actions of Men in general or of the particular Worth and Merit of Authors he had an Honour and a Rectitude of Soul that would have oblig'd him to die a thousand times rather than to Write any thing against his Conscience  Pejuque letho flagitium timet  He was capable indeed of being provok'd to expose either a Fool or a Knave whom otherwise he might have suffer'd to have remain'd in Obscurity but the most barbarous Usage of his most Malicious Enemy could never urge him to slander that Enemy From this Force and Clearness of his Understanding and this Noble Rectitude of his Will it has proceeded that all his Censures are like so many  Decrees  that have been all affirm'd by Posterity the only Supream Court of Judicature for the Distribution of Fame and Infamy from which Mankind can have no Appeal That Supream Impartial Incorruptible Judicature has the same Opinions of Persons and Things and especially of Authors that he had The same high Value for  Tibullus  for  Pollio  for  Varius  for  Virgil  and the same Contempt for  Bavius  for  Maevius  for  Crispinus  for  Alpinus  for  Fannius  and for a Thousand more  The same Justness and Fineness of Discernment and the same noble Rectitude of will appear in the  French Satirist  which make the most considerable Share of his Merit and the most Distinguishing part of his Character if we will believe what he says of himself in his Admirable Epistle to  Monsieur  SEIGNELEY You know Sir that what  Boileau  says there of himself is exactly true in Fact The Persons whom he has attack'd in his Writings have been for the most part Authors and most of those Authors Poets The Censures which he has pass'd on them have been confirm'd by all  Europe  But at the same time that judicious Poet has been as liberal of his Praise to his Contemporaries who were excellent in their Kinds as  Corneille    Racine    Moliere  and  La Fontaine  Nay he  was generous enough to defend  Racine  and to support and strengthen him when a Clamorous croud of miserable Authors endeavoured to oppress him as appears by his Admirable Epistle addrest to that Tragick Poet  You and I both know very well Sir that there has been never wanting a Floud of such Authors neither in  England  nor  France  who being like this Imitator in ev'ry Respect the reverse of  Horace  in Honour in Discernment in Genius have always combin'd to atack any thing that has apear'd above their own dull Level while they have hug'd and admir'd each other Authors who have thought to be too hard for their Adversaries by opposing  Billinsgate  to Reason and Dogmatical Assertion to Moral Demonstration and who have been Ideots enough to belive that their Noise and Impudence could alter the Nature of Things and the Notions of Men of Sense  Of all these Libellers the present Imitator is the most Impudent and the most Incorrigible who has lately pester'd and plagued the World with Five or Six Scandalous Libels in Prose that are all of them at once so stupid and so Malicious that Men of Sence are Doubtful if they should attribute them to the Libellers Native Idiotism or to Accidental Madness  In all these Libels the chief Objects of his Scandal and Malice have been Persons of distinguish'd Merit and among these he has fallen upon none so foully as his Friends and Benefactors Among these latter he has attack'd no one so often or with so much ridiculous impotent Mallice as Sir  Richard Blackmore  who is Estimable for a thousand good and great Qualities And what time has he chosen to do this Why just after that Gentelman had laid very great Oblegations on him and just after he had oblig'd the World with so many Editions of his Excellent  Poem  upon CREATION which  Poem  alone is worth all the  Folios  that this Libeller will ever write and which will render its Author the Delight and Admiration of Posterity So that 'tis hard to determine whether this Libeller is more remarkable for his Judgment or his Gratitude  I dare venture to affirm that there is not an Author living so little Qualified for a Censurer as himself I know nothing for which he is so ill Qualified as he is for Judging  unless it be for Translating HOMER He has neither Taste nor judgment but is if you will pardon a Quibble the very necessity of  Parnassus  for he has none of the Poetical Laws or if he has the Letter of any He has it without the Spirit Whenever he pretends to Criticise I fancy I see  Shamwell  or  Cheatly  in the Squire of  Alsatia  cutting a Sham or Banter to abuse some Bubble The  Presace  is full of gross Errours and he has shewn himself in it a Dogmatical Ignorant Impudent Second Hand Critick As for the  Poem  however he may cry up HOMER for being every where a  Graecian    Trumpeter  in the Original I can see no  Trumpeter  in the  Translator  but the King of  Spain  's But since his Friends will alledge 'tis easie to say this I desire it may go for nothing till I have so plainly prov'd it that the most Foolish and the most Partial of them shall not be able to deny it  As for what they call his  Verses  he has like Mr  Bayes  got a notable knack of Rhiming and Writing smooth verse but without either Genius or Good Sense or any tolerable Knowledge of  English  as I believe I shall shew plainly when I come to the rest of his Imitations As for his Translation of  HOMER  I could never borrow it till this very Day and design to read it over to Morrow so that shortly you may expect to hear more of it I will only tell you beforehand that  HOMER  seems to me to be untranslatable in any Modern Language That great Poet is just in his Desings admirable in his Characters and for the most part exact in his Reasoning and correct in his Noble Sentiments but these are Excellencies which may be already seen in the Prose Translations of Him  The Qualities which so admirably distinguish  HOMER  from most other Writers and which therefore a Translator in Verse is particularly oblig'd to show because they cannot be shown in Prose are the Beauty of his Diction and the various Harmony of his Versification But 'tis as Ridiculous to pretend to make these Shine out in  English  Rhimes as it would be to Emulate upon a  Bagpipe  the Solemn and Majestick Thorough Basse of an  Organ  But you may suddenly expect more of this if what I have already said happens to entertain you  LONDON  May  I am Sir Your  c  FINIS
