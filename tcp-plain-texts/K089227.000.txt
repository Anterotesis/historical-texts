 A RURAL RAMBLE To which is annexed A POETICAL TAGG OR BRIGHTHELMSTONE GUIDE BY G S CAREY  Terry sculp Paternoster Row  LONDON Printed for R THOMAS Brighthelmstone and sold by R BALDWIN Paternosterrow LONDON MDCCLXXVII  APOLOGY  AS the following Trifle is the mere recital of a RURAL RAMBLE when I had not time to wander from the strait and common road I hope the Reader will excuse my not entering more particularly into the Origin of Customs or Date of Antiquities those have already been given the world by more profound and indefatigable pens than mineall that I have attempted is simple incident and if it should not be found altogether suited to the mind from the  Matter  yet I flatter myself I have in some measure written to  Time  and  Mode  as very few of our Fashionable Readers would wish to have the contents of a volume outlast the dres  g of their hair or the common post of a chaise and four  RURAL RAMBLE  WALKING with a friend from the busy Exchange to the forlorn St James's when the sun shot down his hottest rays and the fainting porter groaned beneath his load I observed that London always wore the most unpleasing aspect at the most pleasing season of the year it was July and the gay and fashionable part of the world was gone to  more fashionable or more retired resortstown was half deserted a liberal face was rarely to be met the smart and smirking shopkeeper whose hands but a month ago were well employed in measuring out his different commodities now stood at his door with his hands tucked up behind him his customers fell in like donations to a charity slow but well received  The different avenues sent up their unsavoury odours from their different confines and as the heat encreased the thicker were the rising exhalations we mutually wished to be in the country we challenged each other with a ramble stepped into a tavern eat a good dinner settled the  proposals over a bottle of wine and put our wishes into actionwe agreed to walk or ride as it might suit us for the slower we were in our paces the more explicit in our observations we went home packed up our different necessaries and sent them off by the Tunbridge machine We left town about five o' clock in the afternoon took with us a faithful favourite dog to guard and to amuse us and walked through a perpetual cloud of dust and throng to Greenwich but turning on our way to Lewisham we took our leave on't the trees and hedges now were greener the country stiller and contemplation began to fill the mind  We saunter'd on and bent our way to Bromley enjoying an uninterrupted  conversation save that now and then some view some house or object broke the thread of our discourse and would oft beguile us into a pleasing observation  About nine we enter'd Bromley the evening was breaking in apace but turning round we found there was yet light enough to view the great metropolis we just had left behind St Paul's whose towering dome seemed to kiss the clouds was half encircled in a bed of smoke the busy bustle of the noisy city that but a few hours before almost distracted us now was heard no more and we pleased ourselves with the reflection that we had already set the greatest  and the wealthiest city in the world at so great a distance in so short a time  When we had reached our inn were shewn into a room and placed ourselves in separate chairs we found that if we had been necessitated to have gone farther we should have been tired we ordered a good supper eat with a good appetite went to our beds slept sound and waked in the morning without the headach  In the morning we arose early the sun shone forth in all his splendor and while our breakfasts were preparing we sought the churchyard and wandered through the tombs here and there an uncouth epitaph was  cut perhaps the rude production of the clerk or sexton here we found but little worth our observation either from its oddity sentiment or wit But turning to take a survey of the country round us St Paul's again stood in our way and morning fires sent up clouds of smoke which seemed to make their way for many miles yonder said I is the greatest capital in the world there many a head is aching with its cares there many a heart is breaking with its sorrows some full of age and avarice cleaving to fortune like ivy to the oak scraping up with greedy anxiety massy heaps of gold to make them masters and to bear a transient sway over statemansions and extensive plains let them come here and see how little  how small a spot must soon suffice Here stands a tomb that tells a wealthy merchant lies within and here are too engraved the honors that he once possessed Mark the characters of his life  EPITAPH  He was industrious to his cost  He ne'er a single hour lost  To serve a friend or say a prayer  His business so engross'd his care  In spring of age in highth of pride  His cares o'ercame him and he dy'd  The Scripture tells us there is a time for every thing but this unfortunate man seems to have been possessed of a different way of thinking he wanted to be rich and thought his time was only given him to that end He saw the golden Mammon  in his view and ran himself out of breath in striding forth too hastily to his throne  But says my friend that never shall be the case with me I am rich with a competency I am happy riches cannot purchase more Perhaps the mouldering course that lays within this costly tomb ne'er spent an hour in pleasing reflection like this we now enjoy Ne'er viewed the beauties of the painted meads or strayed the plains to taste the bliss of health or charms of social conversation but he has stolen into the grave with a dull and sordid mind that ne'er would let him look up to the sun We left this consecrated close of meditation and sought our inn eat our  breakfast and made our way to Seven Oaks  The country was beautifully variegated with hanging woods that seemed to fringe the skirts of every hill the vallies fertile and were plentifully scattered over with flocks and herds from every rood we made on either hand we acquired some new object  About fourteen miles from London we discovered a remarkable well very wide deep and the water peerless it was near the common road and seemed to have been dug as a common convenience to every needy thirsty traveller that might chance to pass that way Near it sat on the  trunk of a bulky Elm just felled and lopped of all its branches one who had just refreshed himself from the cooling spring by dipping in one corner of his hat and drinking from the other We accosted him with enquiries he made replies with civility we found him more intelligent than we had reason to expect he said he lived in the neighbourhood was an old inhabitant and told us he had been informed that the well we so much admired was dug by the Romans for the use of one part of their army that once was stationed near that spot he then bid us observe a range of lofty trees at some distance planted in the form of a crescent those he told us were reared to perpetuate the situation in which their tents  were said to have been ranged and that thereabout was said to have been fixed the standard of one of their generals but he honestly acknowledged he could not remember his name said he was fond of reading had read much but he was old and his memory left him with his hairs  We were pleased with his conversation thanked him for the little piece of history he furnished us with bid him a good morning and made the best of our way to Riverhead where we no sooner wished to rest than we found ourselves invited by a whimsical illiterate triplet written under the sign of the maidenhead  Gemmen if you have any  Pray stop and spend one penny  With poor Tom Lemmy  The house is lowly has a thatch'd roof yet it is pleasantly situated on a rising ground about sixty paces from the road the walls were built of clay the landlord humble and seems to place his dependance on cottage customers or frugal country travellers we paid our attention to the invitation on his sign asked what he sold he told us ale of his own brewing and challenged the whole parish in respect to its good body and sound qualities he sometimes made an effort at a joke therefore we put him on his mettle chafed him with rugged questions but we found from his replies he was composed  of so soft a texture that the coalition of his retorts with our simple interrogatives could not produce one spark of wit then we sate us down upon a bench under a spreading tree that shades his house tasted of his ale which was very good we praised it but soon discovered that though he had not much to boast of in respect of wit he had more of cunning for he advised us to have a second tankard which we refused "What" says he  "not any more why can you have too much of a good thing"  at which saying he was so pleased with himself that he laughed immoderately we told him we had drank ale enough had swallowed too many bad jokes and that when we might happen to come that  way again we would thank him for his ale but he might keep his wit for other company this we found in some measure ruffled the poor old man so to shew we did not mean to wage a war of words we shook hands and parted  We arrived at Sevenoaks about noon where we dined took a survey of the ancient seat of his Grace the Duke of Dorset the park is beautifully variegated with lakes and clamps of lofty trees in different parts very judiciously disposed the house has a venerable and magnificent appearance but we had not an opportunity to see the interior excellences The road for some miles is made uncommonly pleasant by the  embowering trees that shelter it from the sun sometimes from side to side they form a lofty arch and then a break present  itself and shews the house in a different point of view furnishing the traveller with a pleasing variety of scenes  We had walked almost to Tunbridge town I believe it might have been at three miles distance a guidepost was fixed at the corner of a lane telling us it was a road to TunbridgeWells but we soon found that it was a road that led us four or five miles out of our way however we arrived at a village about two miles out of the great high road it was pleasant very retired the inhabitants were exceeding rustic and civil there was  a beautiful old church a neat and decent place of entertainment the sun was near his setting and the cricketers were at play upon a smooth and level green the clack of the mill and the sign at the public house brought to my remembrance the old ballad  " At the sign of the horse near the foot of the hill"  We refreshed ourselves here and got instructed in our way to Tunbridge the sun was now gone down it was about five miles we had to go through the most delightful meadows the river was our guide on the banks of which we walked and found out Tunbridge as Queen  Eleanor did her way through the meandering bower by a clue of thread so we by the winding streamthe stars began to twinkle the reedsparrows sung upon the willows at length the moon broke gravely through the clouds and glimmered in the gliding stream  When we arrived at the town of Tunbridge we gave a good lookout for the best inn we fixed upon one that wore the best external appearance but as to the entertainment within I believe I shall not be tempted to visit it any more we ordered supper and out of many things we hardly found one that was fit to eat the wine so bad that we contented ourselves with making it into humble  negus and improved it with lemon water and sugar our bed rooms dirty as were our sheets our beds were hard in the morning when we had eat a breakfast composed of rank butter coarse sugar and illflavoured tea the hostess made a good conclusion by bringing in a long and extravagant bill which brought to our minds what Moody says in the Jubilee of Shakespeare  "We had nothing to eat and paid double for that too"  We sate off in the morning for the Wells which are five miles from the town which we had no sooner left than we found we had gradually to ascend the road to the top of a hill for near two miles which was  richly fertilized with corn wood and pasture from the summit of which we had a most extensive prospect through most parts of Kent part of Surry and Sussex the view was beautifully ornamented with different seats surrounded with parks villages churches with their taper spires and glassy rivers glistening in their vallies Walking on a few miles farther through such a country as I have described we reached the gay romantic Tunbridge Wells  They are in a bottom surrounded by hills or mounts Mount Ephraim Mount Sion Mount Misery c From the pumproom runs a terras of near a thousand feet on which is built a light and airy piazza that  the gentry in rainy weather may walk and talk without being wet under the piazza are ranged all kind of shops booksellers confectioners milleners fruiterers apothecaries Tunbridge wares c There are two sets of public rooms very handsome and convenient Pinchbeck's and Fry's likewise an orchestra erected in the centre of the place in which there is a tolerable band of music employed to play while the company are upon the walks there seems to be a greater harmony in this than any other wateringplace I know perhaps this may proceed from its being more compact that the company are brought more together than at any other place or that the Master of the Ceremonies is a more sensible  man or that he has less of a coxcomb about him than some I could mention who would WADE through thick or thin to get to a gaming table instead of attending to their company or their friends whatever it may proceed from it is most certainly one of the pleasantest and most agreeable places of its kind there are two good inns one I never visited but that which I made my quarters the Angel had the most gentlemanlike civil host I ever met with  The lodginghouses are whimsically seattered round the hills some on a declivity which open to the village with a pleasing slope each house has its grove or garden annexed  to it several personages of distinction make this their summer residence having distinct and elegant villas of their own  About a mile from the Wells there are a range of rocks fantastically ranged when you stand in the valley below them they represent a fleet of stately men of war all abreast bearing down upon the spectator the tops of them are decorated with beautiful shrubs and from out the different crannies shoot the birch and beach from the summit of some stands towering a stately elm which with the assistance of a little fancy may be often thought to bear a good resemblance of a mast and the spreading branches hang like the  furled shrouds They are mostly separated by different isles or avenues in some places they represent the ruins of an old cathedral As we were passing through one of the avenues we discovered the following inscription well chiselled out upon one side of the rock dated near an hundred years ago  INSCRIPTION  Stop passenger and read  Beneath thy feet five fathom low  Lies here entomb'd a beauteous beau  He from the rock's dread summit fell  Strike with thy stick and ring his knell  We instantly struck our canes against the sides of the rock and whether it was from the drossy nature of the stone or from its reverberating  from some particular cell we could not determine however it produced a sound similar to that of a bell We climbed to the top and took a full survey of one of the most beautiful and romantic vallies we ever saw the flocks were making to their fold the moon was rising majestically on the left and a faint glimmering of the lamps at Tunbridge Wells were seen upon our right it was an assembly night and we could sometimes hear the buzzing of the gay  beau monde  hurrying to their revels the contrasted scenes urged me to reflection and placing myself on the root of an old tree near the corner of a rock I pencilled down the following stanzas  I  Ye that groan beneath the weight  Of dissipation pride and state  Condemn'd to walk thro' life's parade  At rout or drum or masquerade  Ye that fain would pleasure find  Led by fortune ever blind  Come and sit along with me  Come and taste tranquillity  II  Or if chas'd by sallow care  Would you shun the hag despair  Would you chearful health restore  When  advice  can do no more  Seek the fresh reviving breeze  Or the fanning of the trees  Come and sit along with me  Come and taste tranquillity  III  Ye that feel the pangs of love  Come and murmur with the dove  Shun the false ungrateful maid  Seek the sweet sequester'd shade  Let her ne'er behold thy tears  Leave herTime the passion wears  Come and sit along with me  Come and taste tranquillity  IV  Ye that languish to regain  A breaking heart or racking brain  Drove by fortune or by fate  To a wild and frantic state  Or moping wander like a loon  Dreading oft the wayward moon  Come and sit along with me  Come and taste tranquillity  We took our leave of Tunbridge Wells but had previously made enquiry of a farmer whom we met plodding near the rocks the preceding day what accomodations he thought we might meet with at Boar'sheadstreet a straggling village five miles from the Wells and in our road to Brighthelmstone he told us there was a  maen  good house called the Boar'shead and gave us to understand the man who kept it was a friend of his and would use us well if we made use of his name we thanked him and rested confidently on his information the weather was warm so purposed getting there between tea and supper to avoid in some measure the expence of lodging  at the Wells for beds are dear very dear at this place accordingly we sat out enjoying the sweet serenity of the evening and arrived at this seemingly deserted village about nine o'clock comforting ourselves that we had made an end of our journey then enquired for the Boar'shead which we according to the farmer's tale supposed a tolerable inn but to our mutual mortification found it nothing but a humble pot house and the landlord and his wife for want of custom were gone to bed however we were determined not to be too precipitately prejudiced by external appearances which is too generally the case so knocked at the door for our predicament made us flatter ourselves  it might be better than it seemed as soon as we were heard we were questioned by a female with a ragged head peeping through as ragged a casement with  "Who is there"  we told our business she replied  "'Ifegs we've got no beds"  then said we have you no wine  "No 'Ifegs we have no commendation for gemmen"  we asked her where we might expect to be accommodated  "Oh sir a little farther there is a  desperate  good house called Crowberry Gate"  we asked her how far she might suppose it was to Crowborough Gate she replied  "only four miles"  we with an emphasis of admiration as well as mortification cried  only  four miles  "no indeed gemmen I'fegs it is  no more"  as we had no other alternative than pursuing our journey we gulped the disappointment like a bitter bolus and made the best of our way to Crowborough Gate though not without some fears and from different causes the one that we might chance to  miss  our way and the other that we might happen to be  stopped  upon the way but the evening being very favourable after crossing an extensive heath such a one on which one might conceive Macbeth held converse with the Witches we reached Crowborough Gate 'tis a lonely house all were fast asleep within we had no one to ask whether it was the house to which we had been directed or not but looking at the sign which  we with difficulty distinguished was a Crow and a Gate the Crow was represented sitting on the top then making to the house which we feared at first was uninhabited perceived a label on the door on which was written  "London Porter sold here"  we knocked but it was a long time before we could raise the soporific landlord at length a window was thrown up at which a head appeared with a topping like a buffalo and voice like a bear or Caliban crying  "Who is at the door"  we told him we were benighted were tired and should be glad of something to eat and a bed to rest ourselves  "that may be he cried but I don't think it worth my while to let you in"  we importuned him much  but found him obdurate then asked him what county we were in to which he replied  "Sussex and a very good county too"  we were sorry he had given us so bad a specimen of it however we desired him to acquaint us where there was any likelihood of getting proper entertainment  "Where said he why at the Uckfield"  which he gave us to understand was five miles farther  "there you may chance to get in they are up there all hours so I wish you a good night"  This staggered our philosophy as our exercise had not only made us heartily wish to rest but had begot an appetite we wished to gratify this said my friend is one of the  many vicissitudes travellers often experience let us comfort ourselves with one consolation which many in our present situation are not furnished with though we have met with the want of humanity we are not also in want of money that and daylight will bring us to some haven the first will urge the industrious to open their doors and the latter the most sordid to open their hearts  When we had with weary paces plodded about a mile from this inhospitable dwelling the road though it was night was still made darker by the gloomy curtain of a woodthere was a friendly stile at the entrance of an avenue that seemingly  meandered through the solemn shades here we sat and rested for a while the fluttering bat flew wantonly around our heads the cricket sung the owl hooted to his fellow sage yet all contributed to form a pleasing awful scene here similar to the time we quoted many a favourite verse from Shakespeare Milton Dryden of our immortal bards of oldthere was a cottage opposite to where we sate the silence of the night was broke by the whimsical controversy of its inhabitants we could easily distinguish what they said and drawing nearer to the door we found it was a curious curtain lecture which a woman was delivering to her drowsy husband she evidently discovered a perturbed spirit her  husband's conduct the preceding day would not let her rest for this was partly the discourse  "Ah you can sleep wellenough and be hanged to you a fine day's work you have made on't indeed you have brought your pigs to a fine market sold only one poor sack of wheat and spent half the money by the way"  to which the husband replied rather vociferously  "What the devil is the woman mad can one have no rest for you night nor day I never brought my pigs to so bad a market as when I married you"  these words were but throwing spirits on the fire reproach was answered by reproach and as the weakest always falls to the ground the wife was  tumbled out of bed this raised the rest of the family who with a friendly interference convinced them they were both in the wrong and after some little wailing of the wife the husband was softened into pity they kissed and made it up and we pursued our journey when we reached Uckfield we were so tired that we were determined to go no further As we entered the town the church clock struck one this directly brought to our fancy the first two lines in Young's Night Thoughts  " The clock strikes one  " We take no note of time but from its loss"  All seemed folded up in sleep and silence anon a cheering candle from a garret window shot its feeble rays and much attracted our attention and lest it should unfortunately have been extinguished before we reached the house in which it was we made the best of our way 'twas at the sign of the Maidenhead we knocked and was immediately answered by a mild angelic voice from above we asked if we could be furnished with a supper and a bed yes replied the damsel  "I'll go to my mistress directly for the key"  no cry of a reprieve to a despairing criminal could have been received with greater welcome presently a murmuring we heard in her mistress's  chamber and from her long delay of bringing down the key we feared some obstacle was raised by fate still to exercise our patience and our conjectures were too directly verified our little bird of hope returned but sang a different strain  "Gentlemen I am very sorry sorry indeed but my mistress says she will let in none tonight"  here I broke out into heroics tell your mistress then she is inhuman we will go no farther we are tired hungry and benighted my poor dog too is footsore and still more hungry than ourselves he shall be my pillow and here we will stay till morning this had some effect for we were desired to stay for a moment the hostess was about revoking of her sentence but first  the hostler was sent out to reconnoitre his instructions we plainly could conceive were to notice our address and our attire he saluted us with pity the most contemptible specimen of friendship then admired the beauty and nobility of our dog who would have brought the hostler on his first appearance to the ground had not we prevented him for his exterior character was truly grotesque a woollen night cap half drawn over a bushy head of hair a waggoner's frock thrown over his shoulders was without stockings but had on a pair of shoes that made a clattering like a troop of horse after he had satisfied himself with taking a full survey of us and our dog he said he would try his mistress  again he did not see why she might not let us in he had not left us long before he put his head out of the window and seemingly with some pleasure cried  "Gemmen stay a moment I'm coming down I've got the key"  presently the door was unlocked which raised a most ecstatic impulse in our breasts 'twas a second heaven nothing but the key of St Peter could have given greater bliss A cold collation and a jug of humming ale was soon produced which was crowned with a bouncing bottle of rich old Tawny Port I need not say with what a zest we battened on our unexpected meal of luxury but that we might not abuse the indulgencies they had shewn for so we thought them we  went to our beds sooner than we otherwise would have done no peasant from his long day's toil ever sounder slept we did not rise till twelve at noon our anxieties and our labours being over we began already to reflect with pleasure on the vicissitudes of the preceding day how dearly we had purchased and how heartily we received our meal but we made it our first business to address our hostess with all the civilities we were masters of for her humanity and for her indulging us with an admittance at so unseasonable an hour but she presently overwhelmed our gratitude "ah" said she  "you have no occasion to thank me so much for yourselves 'twas not for  your sake  I heard you had a  dog  with you I pitied  him  there+fore I let you in oh I'm vastly fond of dogs and a fine fellow he is"  looking at him and fawning on him all the while this caused us to laugh immoderately and made our dumb but faithful companion seem still more valuable than ever we breakfasted at noon on the best tea sugar butter cream and rolls that were ever put upon a table then ordered a chaise to Lewes we had the wilds of Sussex in our view a beautiful range of lofty mountains the hedges on each side the road became more scanty and the trees more scarce when we arrived near the margin of the mightiest hill we mutually agreed to leave our chaise a while and obtain the formidable  heighth the turf which cloathed its bulky sides was smooth and green nibbled by the sheep the air was thinner still and thinner as we ascended toward the top and when we had obtained the summit a sweet refreshing breeze restored us from our lassitude this was a novel scene indeed the sea disclosed itself upon our left and distant was the view on every side in different parts were seen the careless shepherd and his watchful cur stretched upon the ground while the harmless flock was feeding near his side Lewes had a beautiful effect the river glistening in the valley the venerable castle mantled over with ivy overlooked the town this caused us to observe that the very spot on which we stood  so silent and serene was once the seat of war for here in times of old did many a Saxon with a Briton fall yon flinty walls stood many a siege and all these plains were anarchy and uproar but peace now reigns and pure tranquillity here we could have roamed the livelong day but growing anxious for our journey's end descended to our chaise and made the best of our way to Brighthelmstone we went through Lewes the town is beautiful and erected on the declivity of a hill the houses chiefly built with flint cut into squares like bricks and every house almost has its arbour of jessamine at the door the inhabitants rich but proud and boorish the women  handsome but illiterate the inns are spacious but exorbitant were it not for these obstructions I do not know a town that I would sooner wish to make my residence When we had got through Lewes we presently arrived at Brighthelmstone though we could see little of the town till we were close upon its borders the transition was great the silent rural scene was now no more the gay  beaumonde  were here assembled in all the hurry of a jubilee the racket of the carriages and the rushing of the ocean made a glorious uproar I had not been here a day before my muse began to wanton in my mind and tumbled forth the following Poetical TAGG  THE TAGG OR BRIGHTHELMSTONE GUIDE  THE TAGG OR BRIGHTHELMSTONE GUIDE  To R BD  Esq  Oxford  YOU say you vastly long to hear  What great inducements we have here  That coaxes all our courtiers down  And half depopulates the town  Like Bath you think our streets are fine  Our squares and crescents all divine  You think our hills and vales produce  The pomgranate or nectar juice  In rhime you ask me to relate  The wonders of its present state  Tho' you're a critic yet I'll try  To give it you in poetry  This town or village of renown  Like London Bridge half broken down  Few yers ago was worse than Wapping  Not fit for human soul to stop in  But now like to a wornout shoe  By patching well the place will do  You'd wonder much I'm sure to see  How it's becramm'd with quality  Here Lords and Ladies oft carouse  Together in a tiny house  Like Joan and Darby in their cot  With stool and table spit and pot  And what his valet would despise  His lordship praises to the skies  But such the  ton  is such the case  You'll see the first of rank or place  With star and riband all profuse  Duck at his doorway like a goose  The humble beam was plac'd so low  Perhaps to teach some clown to bow  The air is pure as pure can be  And such an aspect of the sea  As you perhaps ne'er saw before  From off the side of any shore  On one hand Ceres spread her plain  And on the other o'er the main  Many a bark majestic laves  Upon the salt and buoyant waves  The hills all mantl'd o'er with green  A friendly shelter to the Styene  Whene'er the rugged Boreas blows  Bemingled with unwelcome snows  Such is the place and situation  Such is the reigning seat of fashion  Brighthelmstone  July th  THE TABERNACLE  To M P A  Esq  YOU perhaps have not heard that the Countess of Grace  Has built a new Methodist house at this place  You may

the wisest confound  But now it's as clear as four crowns to a pound  Arithmeticlike are all matters reveal'd  That so shamefully lay to past ages concealed  By tropes or by figures we're all set to

rather be damn'd than you'd part with a penny  You that here come with your faces so meek  Who worship old Mammon the rest of the week  Some selling of one thing or making another  By cheating and

poor tongues very hot  Of faith or of grace not a  drop  left to cool ye  Because you will let that old Beelzebub rule ye  But he that a penny to Peter shall pay  I'll give him a  bucket  of faith ev'ry day  He that feeds daily on conserves and  pickles  And every hour his appetite tickles  He little now thinketh because he lives well  What a  pickle  he'll be in when burning in hell  When bathing in brimstone as hot as a heater  He'll then wish he'd given his penny to Peter  I've touch'd you then have II've touch'd to the quick  You'd forgot then that cunning old soulcatcher Nick  You did not then know of his fiery lakes  How he spreads out his nets and what trouble he takes  Like a birdcatcher sitting conceal'd in a ditch  As sly as a sox and as foul as a witch  Just like to that

deceive me in holy disguise  Brighthelmstone  August  To the Rev Mr HD  I'VE just left a scene and had you been present  I'm sure you'd have thought it was wonderous pleasant  T'other morn as my lady  Fallal  was at tea  Just after she'd pickl'd herself in the sea  She gap'd and she yawn'd and said it was strange  That the sea should have made such a wonderful change  She rose to the glass her old tresses to plume  Then smil'd on herself and she fancied a bloom  Lord Saunter was there like herself in decay  Who came down to wash all his humours away  Pray my good lord said my lady Fallal  Don't you think it a heaven compar'd to Pall mall  What tho' we've no park nor a tree to be seen  But yet there's that little sweet level the Styene  'Tis a damnable town says my lord you'll agree  But then says my lady my lord there's the sea  Then says my lord in a jocular strain  I don't think I ever shall  sea  it again  At length then the thread of the subject to break  My lady propos'd some excursion to take  For time seems to hang here most sadly on hand  Altho' it's the firstfashion'd place in the land  Ods bobs says my lord there's a raffle on foot  That's good says my lady so off they went to't  You'd have laugh'd to have seen 'em or amble or hop  With a heart full of glee to the booksellers' shop  The booksellers shop is the change of this place  From Sir Timothy Traffick e'en up to his Grace  For my lordduke of Blenheim preferreth the Styene  To a palace that's fit for a King or a Queen  But the bookseller's shop I must tell all about it  The place would be dull as a dunghill without it  In a corner sat little miss Titup a leering  And old lady Wishfor't sat opposite sneering  Sir Christopher Croaker with spindles so taper  Sat squinting thro' spectacles over a paper  Then all of a sudden began he to croak  This war with the Congress by Gd is no joke  Then addressing himself to a newmarried dame  Who was deeply engag'd with the Temple of Fame  What think you my ladyI don't think at all  Sir Christopher Croaker unless of a ball  Apropos she continued pray what do you say  Now you talk of a ball will you go to the play  Sir Christopher instantly seiz'd with the dumps  He threw down his paper and took to his stumps  He wonder'd how people could e'er think of plays  In these terrible troublesome critical days  A new face appear'd in a smart riding hat  The whisper was instantlyPray who is that  'Tis miss Molly Mundungus"What fortune" but small  " No person of rank then" no nothing at all  " Don't you think she is pretty" yes without grace  All beauty you know is not centr'd in face  Do but observe how she carries her arms  And yet the poor simpleton fancies she charms  If she looks for a fortune cries one with a scoff  She may wait till she's tir'd before she goes off  Though she that said this will perhaps lay herself  Until she is musty upon the high shelf  She was old and as ugly as envy could make her  As fine as a Bellhorse as stiff as a quaker  And what is still worse I am sorely afraid  She's likely poor lady to die an old maid  Miss Mundungus came in and a prettier face  I'll venture to say was ne'er seen in the place  So dimpled so blooming so smiling and young  And then when she spoke such a musical tongue  I couldthat I couldbut I won't tell you now  Oddsbobs I'd forgot there was Billy the beau  With his Rse by his side you scarcely would think it  He presented my lady Fallal with a trinket  And then to miss Titup began to make love  And what was his passionto put on her glove  One ask'd the gay beau why he ventur'd to roam  And leave his dear Butter Patt  ighing at home  He straight took the hint and cry'd come my dear Rse  And mounting his whisky to London he goes  Brighthelmstone  August  To W D  Esq  Oxford  YOU ask me if I spend my day  In the circle of the gay  Or if greater pleasures rise  From the sylvan deities  Listen then while I confess  How I purchase happiness  'Tis not on the crouded Styene  Where the great and proud are seen  No nor do I ever stoop  Where the vari'gated group  Bend to Fashion's airy shrine  Such are no pursuits of mine  But when Tyrralyrra sings  Spreading his ecstatic wings  With some friend or fav'rite book  Near some fountain or some brook  There it is I take my seat  There I always pleasure meet  Or where Ceres spreads the plain  With her rich luxuriant grain  Or Pomona's fruits invite  Tempting of the ravish'd sight  Oft the mountain's brow I tread  Where the shepherd's care is spread  Or the gradual heights ascend  View or prospect to extend  Plains or distant hills I spy  Proudly tow'ring to the sky  Here a level there a steep  Or a winding river peep  Shewing oft its glassy face  In some unexpected place  Till some mountain rise between  Vari'gating of the scene  There it is I take my seat  There I always pleasure meet  Here tho' coy to sluggish wealth  Sits the rosy god of health  Here his fount for ever flows  Ev'ry happy shepherd knows  Here the gentle zephyrs spill  Their aromatics round each hill  Here the listless nerve is brac'd  Here the wonted bloom replac'd  Robb'd by dissipation's crew  Here restores its native hue  Then my friend attend to me  Tread the margin of the sea  Seek the woodland or the lawn  Or the hill at early dawn  'Ere the thirsty sun appears  Tippling on nocturnal tears  There it is I take my seat  There it is I  pleasure  meet  Brighthelmstone  August  A SYLVAN ODE  Intended to have been performed one Moonlight Evening to a Select Society in the Grove at PRESTON near BRIGHTHELMSTONE  RECITATIVE  COME ye gay illustrious train  Rivals of the Cypraean queen  This is now the golden reign  Where each social face is seen  For sallow Care  Ne'er enters here  To the sordid miser's cell  He's sure to hie  With low'ring eye  But dares not in this circle dwell  AIR  Sons of Bacchus and Apollo  Follow follow follow follow  Sylvans Sylphs and Faries come  From hillock green or cavern hollow  Come and join the chearful throng  In merry dance or merry song  Sylvans Sylphs and Fairies come  Come come along  RECITATIVE  With pearly veil  Behold fair Cynthia mantles ev'ry tree  The thriftiest maiden of the vaulted sky  The Zephyrs rise and at their bidding see  The tow'ring branches with their plumage high  Nod to the gale  With what majestic homage they incline  To make this jocund scene a scene divine  AIR  To every cadence let echo return  Her soft swelling notes from her rockriven cave  Let every bosom with rhapsody burn  And the heart in a fountain of extacy lave  Let every mountain let every dell  Return a soft echo to sweet Philomel  RECITATIVE  Once more your tuneful voices raise  Where'ere ye lay where'ere ye rove  On dreary heath or woody maze  Or in the loverhaunted grove  Now tune the shell or strike the lyre  Enforc'd by rich poetic fire  And as you sing or as you play  Be this the burthen of your lay  CHORUS  Let Peace for ever ever smile  Around this heavenfavour'd Isle  From East and West this sentence sing  " Protect her Beauties and her King"  FINIS
