 ESSAYS UPON Several Projects OR Effectual Ways for advancing the Interest of the Nation  Wherein are plainly laid down The Means by which the Subjects in general may be eased and enriched the Poor relieved and Trade encreased in the most material Branches of it  viz  in Constituting Seamen to theirs and the Nations Advantage for Encouragement of Merchants and Merchandizing for Relief of the Poor of Friendly Societies for discouraging Vice and encouraging Vertue the Usefulness of Banks and Assurances to prevent Bankrupts with the surest way to recover bad Debts and many other considerable things profitable and conducing to the great Advantage of the Nation in general  LONDON  Printed for  Thomas Ballard  at the  Rising Sun  in  Little Britain    PREFACE TO Dalby Thomas  Esq  One of the COMMISSIONERS for Managing His Majesty's Duties on Glass  c  SIR  THIS Preface comes Directed to you not as Commissioner  c  under whom I have the Honour to serve his Majesty nor as a Friend though I have great Obligations of that sort also but as the most proper Judge of the Subjects Treated of and more Capable than the greatest part of Mankind to Distinguish and Understand them  Books  are useful only to such whose Genius are suitable to the Subject of them And to  Dedicate a Book of Projects to a Person who had never concern'd himself to Think that way would be like Musick to one that has no Ear  And yet Your having a Capacity to Judge of these things no way brings You under the Despicable Title of a  Projector  any more than knowing the Practices and Subtleties of Wicked Men makes a Man guilty of their Crimes  The several Chapters of this Book are the results of particular Thoughts occasion'd by Conversing with the Publick Affairs during the present War with  France  The Losses and Casualties which attend all Trading Nations in the World when involved in so Cruel a War as this have reach'd us all and I am none of the least Sufferers if this has put me as well as others on Inventions and Projects so much the Subject of this Book 'tis no more than a proof of the Reason I give for the general Projecting Humour of the Nation  One unhappiness I lie under in the following Book  viz  That having kept the greatest Part of it by me for near Five Years several of the Thoughts seem to be hit by other Hands and some by the Publick which turns the tables upon me as if I had Borrow'd from them  As particularly that of the Seamen which you know well I had contriv'd long before the Act for Registring Seamen was Propos'd And that of Educating Women which I think my self bound to Declare was form'd long before the Book call'd  Advice to the Ladies  was made Publick and yet I do not Write this to Magnify my own Invention but to acquit my self from Grafting on other People's Thoughts If I have Trespass'd upon any Person in the World 'tis upon Your self from whom I had some of the Notions about County Banks and Factories for Goods in the Chapter of Banks and yet I do not think that my Proposal  for the Women or the Seamen clashes at all either with that Book on the Publick method of Registring Seamen  I have been told since this was done That my Proposal for a  Commission of Enquiries into Bankrupt Estates  is Borrow'd from the  Dutch  if there is any thing like it among the  Dutch  'tis more than ever I knew or know yet but if so I hope 'tis no Objection against our having the same here especially if it be true that 'twou'd be so publickly Beneficial as is express'd  What is said of  Friendly Societies  I think no Man will Dispute with me since one has met with so much Success already in the Practice of it I mean  The Friendly Society for Widows  of which you have been pleas'd to be a Governor  Friendly Societies are very extensive and as I have hinted might be carri'd on to many Particulars I have omitted one which was mention'd in Discourse  with your self where a Hundred Tradesmen all of several Trades Agree together to Buy whatever they want of one another and no where else  Prices  and  Payments  to be settled among themselves whereby every Man is sure to have Ninety nine Customers and can never want a Trade And I cou'd have fill'd up the Book with Instances of like nature but I never design'd to tire the Reader with Particulars  The Proposal of the  PensionOffice  you will soon see offer'd to the Publick as an Attempt for the Relief of the Poor which if it meets with Encouragement will every way answer all the great Things I have said of it  I had Wrote a great many Sheets about the Coin about bringing in Plate to the Mint and about our Standard but so many great Heads being upon it with some of whom my Opinion does not agree I wou'd not adventure to appear in Print upon that Subject  Ways and Means also I have laid by on the same score Only adhering to this one Point That be it by Taxing the Wares they Sell be it by Taxing them in Stock be it by Composition  which by the way I believe is the best  be it by what way soever the Parliament please the Retailers are the Men who seem to call upon us to be Tax'd if not by their own extraordinary good Circumstances though that might bear it yet by the contrary in all other Degrees of the Kingdom  Besides the Retailers are the only men who cou'd pay it with least damage because it is in their power to levy it again upon their Customers in the Prices of their Goods and is no more than paying a higher Rent for their Shops  The Retailers of Manufactures especially so far as relates to the Inland Trade have never been tax'd yet and their Wealth or Number is not easily calculated Trade and Land has been handled  roughly enough and these are the men who now lye as a Reserve to carry on the Burthen of the War  These are the Men who were the LandTax collected as it shou'd be ought to pay the King more than that whole Bill ever produc'd and yet these are the men who I think I may venture to say do not pay a Twentieth part in that Bill  Shou'd the King appoint a Survey over the Assessors and Indict all those who were found faulty allowing a Reward to any Discoverer of an Assessment made lower than the literal Sense of the Act implies What a Register of Frauds and Connivances wou'd be found out  In a General Tax if any shou'd be excus'd it shou'd be the Poor who are not able to pay or at least are pinch'd in the necessary parts of Life by paying And yet here a poor Labourer who works for TwelvePence or EighteenPence a Day does not  drink a Pot of Beer but pays the King a Tenth part for Excise and really pays more to the King's Taxes in a year than a Countrey Shopkeeper who is Alderman of the Town worth perhaps Two or Three Thousand Pounds brews his own Beer pays no Excise and in the LandTax is rated it may be  l  and pays  l    s per Annum  But ought if the Act were put in due execution to pay  l per Ann  to the King  If I were to be ask'd how I wou'd remedy this I wou'd answer It shou'd be by some Method in which every man may be tax'd in the due proportion to his Estate and the Act put in execution according to the true Intent and Meaning of it in order to which a  Commission of Assessment  shou'd be granted to Twelve Men such as His Majesty shou'd be well satisfied of who shou'd go through the whole Kingdom Three in a Body and shou'd make a new Assessment of Personal Estates  not to meddle with Land  To these Assessors shou'd all the Old Rates ParishBooks PoorRates and HighwayRates also be delivered and upon due Enquiry to be made into the Manner of Living and reputed Wealth of the People the Stock or Personal Estate of every man shou'd be assess'd without Connivance and he who is reputed to be worth a Thousand Pound shou'd be tax'd at a Thousand Pound and so on And he who was an overgrown Rich Tradesman of Twenty or Thirty thousand Pounds Estate shou'd be tax'd so and Plain  English  and Plain Dealing be practis'd indifferently throughout the Kingdom Tradesmen and Landed men shou'd have Neighbours Fare as we call it and a Rich Man shou'd not be pass'd by when a Poor Man pays  We read of the Inhabitants of  Constantinople  that they suffer'd their City to be lost for want of contributing in time for its Defence and pleaded Poverty to  their Generous Emperor when he went from House to House to persuade them and yet when the  Turks  took it the Prodigious Immense Wealth they found in it made 'em wonder at the sordid Temper of the Citizens  England  with due Exceptions to the Parliament and the Freedom wherewith they have given to the Publick Charge is much like  Constantinople  we are involv'd in a Dangerous a Chargeable but withal a most Just and Necessary War and the Richest and Money'd Men in the Kingdom plead Poverty and the  French  or King  James  or the  Devil  may come for them if they can but conceal their Estates from the Publick Notice and get the Assessors to tax them at an UnderRate  These are the men this Commission wou'd discover and here they shou'd find men tax'd at  l  Stock who are worth  l  Here they shou'd find a certain Rich Man near  Hackney  rated to day  in the TaxBook at  l  Stock and to morrow offering  l  for an Estate  Here they shou'd find Sir  J C  perhaps tax'd to the King at  l  stock perhaps not so much whose Cash no man can guess at And multitudes of Instances I cou'd give by name without wrong to the Gentlemen  And not to run on in Particulars I affirm That in the LandTax Ten certain Gentlemen in  London  put together did not pay for half so much Personal Estate call'd  Stock  as the poorest of them is reputed really to possess  I do not enquire at whose door this Fraud must lye 'tis none of my business  I wish they wou'd search into it whose Power can punish it But this with Submission I presume to say  The King is thereby defrauded and horribly abus'd the true Intent and Meaning of Acts of Parliament evaded the Nation involv'd in Debt by fatal Deficiencies  and Interests FellowSubjects abus'd and new Inventions for Taxes occasion'd  The last Chapter in this Book is a Proposal about entring all the Seamen in  England  into the King's Pay a Subject which deserves to be enlarg'd into a Book it self and I have a little Volume of Calculations and Particulars by me on that Head but I thought them too long to publish In short I am persuaded was that Method propos'd to those Gentlemen to whom such things belong the greatest Sum of Money might be rais'd by it with the least Injury to those who pay it that ever was or will be during the War  Projectors  they say are generally to be taken with allowance of one half at least they always have their mouths full of Millions and talk big of their own Proposals and therefore I have not expos'd the vast Sums my Calculations amount to but I venture to say I could procure a Farm on such a Proposal as this at Three Millions  per Ann  and give very good Security for Payment such an Opinion I have of the Value of such a Method and when that is done the Nation wou'd get Three more by paying it which is very strange but might easily be made out  In the Chapter of Academies I have ventur'd to reprove the Vicious Custom of Swearing I shall make no Apology for the Fact for no man ought to be asham'd of exposing what all men ought to be asham'd of practising But methinks I stand corrected by my own Laws a little in forcing the Reader to repeat some of the worst of our Vulgar Imprecations in reading my Thoughts against it To which however I have this to reply  First  I did not find it easy to express what I mean without putting down the very Words at least not so as to be very Intelligible  Secondly  Why should Words repeated only to expose the Vice taint the Reader  more than a Sermon preach'd against Lewdness should the Assembly for of necessity it leads the Hearer to the Thoughts of the Fact but the Morality of every Action lies in the End and if the Reader by ill use renders himself guilty of the Fact in Reading which I design'd to expose by Writing the Fault is his not mine  I have endeavour'd every where in this Book to be as Concise as possible except where Calculations oblig'd me to be particular and having avoided Impertinence in the  Book  I wou'd avoid it too in the  Preface  and therefore shall break off with subscribing my self  SIR  Your most Obliged Humble Servant  D F  Introduction  _NEcessity which is allow'd to be the Mother of Invention has so violently agitated the Wits of men at this time that it seems not at all improper by way of distinction to call it  The Projecting Age  For tho' in times of War and Publick Confusions the like Humour of Invention has seem'd to stir yet without being partial to the present it is I think no Injury to say the past Ages have never come up to the degree of Projecting and Inventing as it refers to Matters of Negoce and  Methods of Civil Polity which we see this Age arriv'd to  Nor is it a hard matter to assign probable Causes of the Perfection in this Modern Art I am not of their melancholy Opinion who ascribe it to the general Poverty of the Nation since I believe 'tis easy to prove the Nation it self taking it as one General Stock is not at all diminish'd or impoverish'd by this Long this Chargeable War but on the contrary was never Richer since it was inhabited  Nor am I absolutely of the Opinion that we are so happy as to be Wiser in this Age than our Forefathers tho' at the same time I must own some parts of Knowledge in Science as well as Art has received Improvements in this Age altogether conceal'd from the former  The Art of War which I take to be the highest Perfection of Human Knowledge is a sufficient Proof of what I say especially in conducting Armies and in offensive Engines  witness  the new ways of Mines Fougades Entrenchments Attacks Elodgments and a long  Et Cetera  of New Inventions which want Names practised in Sieges and Encampments  witness  the new sorts of Bombs and unheardof Mortars of Seven to Ten Ton Weight with which our Fleets standing two or three Miles off at Sea can imitate God Almighty himself and rain  Fire and Brimstone  out of Heaven as it were upon Towns built on the firm Land  witness also  our newinvented  Child of Hell  the Machine which carries Thunder Lightning and Earthquakes in its  Bowels and tears up the most impregnable Fortifications  But if I would search for a Cause from whence it comes to pass that this Age swarms with such a multitude of Projectors more than usual who besides the Innumerable Conceptions which dye in the bringing forth and like Abortions of the Brain only come into the Air and dissolve do really every day produce new Contrivances Engines and Projects to get Money never before thought of if I say I would examine whence this comes to pass it must be thus  The Losses and Depredations which this War brought with it at first were exceeding many suffer'd chiefly by the Ill Conduct of Merchants themselves who did not apprehend the Danger to be really what it was For before our Admiralty could possibly  settle Convoys Cruisers and Stations for Men of War all over the World the  French  cover'd the Sea with their Privateers and took an incredible number of our Ships I have heard the Loss computed by those who pretended they were able to guess at above Fifteen Millions of Pounds  sterling  in Ships and Goods in the first two or three Years of the War A Sum which if put into  French  would make such a rumbling Sound of great Numbers as would fright a weak Accomptant out of his belief being no less than One hundred and Ninety Millions of  Livres  The weight of this Loss fell chiefly on the Trading Part of the Nation and amongst them on the Merchants and amongst them again upon the most refin'd Capacities as the Insurers  c  And an incredible number of the best Merchants  in the Kingdom sunk under the Load as may appear a little by a Bill which once pass'd the House of Commons for the Relief of MerchantInsurers who had suffered by the War with  France  If a great many fell much greater were the number of those who felt a sensible Ebb of their Fortunes and with difficulty bore up under the Loss of great part of their Estates These prompted by Necessity rack their Wits for New Contrivances New Inventions New Trades Stocks Projects and any thing to retrieve the desperate Credit of their Fortunes That this is probable to be the Cause will appear further thus  France  tho' I do not believe all the great Outcries we make of their Misery and Distress if one half of which be true they are certainly the best Subjects in the world  yet without question has felt its share of the Losses and Damages of the War But the Poverty there falling chiefly on the Poorer sort of People they have not been so fruitful in Inventions and Practices of this nature their Genius being quite of another strain As for the Gentry and more capable sort the first thing a  French  man flies to in his distress is the Army and he seldom comes back from thence to Get an Estate by painful Industry but either has his Brains knock'd out or makes his Fortune there  If Industry be in any Business rewarded with success 'tis in the Merchandizing Part of the World who indeed may more truly be said to live by their Wits than any people whatsoever All Foreign Negoce tho' to some 'tis a plain road by the help of  Custom yet it is in its beginning all Project Contrivance and Invention Every new Voyage the Merchant contrives is a Project and Ships are sent from Port to Port as Markets and Merchandizes differ by the help of strange and Universal Intelligence wherein some are so exquisite so swift and so exact that a Merchant sitting at home in his Countinghouse at once converses with all Parts of the known World This and Travel makes a Truebred Merchant the most Intelligent Man in the World and consequently the most capable when urg'd by Necessity to Contrive New Ways to live And from hence I humbly conceive may very properly be deriv'd the  Projects  so much the Subject of the present Discourse And to this sort of men 'tis easy to trace the Original of Banks Stocks Stockjobbing  Assurances Friendly Societies Lotteries and the like  To this may be added the long annual Enquiry in the House of Commons for Ways and Means which has been a particular movement to set all the Heads of the Nation at work and I appeal with submission to the Gentlemen of that Honourable House if the greatest part of all the Ways and Means out of the common road of LandTaxes Polls and the like have not been handed to them from the Merchant and in a great measure Paid by 'em too  However I offer this but as an Essay at the Original of this prevaling Humour of the People and as 'tis probable so 'tis also possible to be otherwise which I submit to future demonstration  Of the several ways this Faculty of Projecting have exerted it self and of the various Methods as the Genius of the Authors has inclin'd I have been a diligent Observer and in most an unconcern'd Spectator and perhaps have some advantage from thence more easily to discover the  faux Pas  of the Actors If I have given an Essay towards any thing New or made Discovery to advantage of any Contrivance now on foot all Men are at the liberty to make use of the Improvement if any Fraud is discover'd as now practis'd 'tis without any particular Reflection upon Parties or Persons  Projects of the nature I Treat about are doubtless in general of publick Advantage as they tend to Improvement of Trade and Employment of the Poor and the Circulation  and Increase of the publick Stock of the Kingdom but this is suppos'd of such as are built on the honest Basis of Ingenuity and Improvement in which tho' I'le allow the Author to aim primarily at his own Advantage yet with the circumstances of Publick Benefit added  Wherefore 'tis necessary to distinguish among the Projects of the present times between the Honest and the Dishonest  There are and that too many fair pretences of fine Discoveries new Inventions Engines and I know not what which being advanc'd in Notion and talk'd up to great things to be perform'd when such and such Sums of Money shall be advanc'd and such and such Engines are made have rais'd the Fancies of Credulous People to such height that meerly  on the shadow of Expectation they have form'd Companies chose Committees appointed Officers Shares and Books rais'd great Stocks and cri'd up an empty Notion to that degree that People have been betray'd to part with their Money for Shares in a  NewNothing  and when the Inventors have carri'd on the Jest till they have Sold all their own Interest they leave the Cloud to vanish of it self and the poor Purchasers to Quarrel with one another and go to Law about Settlements Transferrings and some Bone or other thrown among 'em by the Subtlety of the Author to lay the blame of the Miscarriage upon themselves Thus the Shares at first begin to fall by degrees and happy is he that Sells in time till like Brass Money it will go at last for nothing at all So have I seen Shares  in JointStocks Patents Engines and Undertakings blown up by the air of great Words and the Name of some Man of Credit concerned to  l  for a  th  Part or Share some more and at last dwindle away till it has been StockJobb'd down to  l  a Share and at last no Buyer that is in short the fine new word for Nothingworth and many Families ruin'd by the Purchase If I should name  LinnenManufactures SaltpeterWorks CopperMines DivingEngines Dipping  and the like for instances of this I shou'd I believe do no wrong to Truth or to some Persons too visibly guilty  I might go on upon this Subject to expose the Frauds and Tricks of  StockJobbers Engineers Patentees Committees  with those  ExchangeMountebanks  we very properly call  Brokers  but I have  not Gaul enough for such a work but as a general rule of caution to those who wou'd not be Trick'd out of their Estates by such Pretenders to New Inventions let them observe That all such People who may be suspected of Design have assuredly this in their Proposal Your Money to the Author must go before the Experiment And here I could give a very diverting History of a PatentMonger whose Cully was no body but my self but I refer it to another occasion  But this is no reason why Invention upon honest foundations and to fair purposes shou'd not be encourag'd no nor why the Author of any such fair Contrivances should not reap the harvest of his own Ingenuity out Acts of Parliament for granting Patents to first Inventors for Fourteen years is a sufficient acknowledgment  of the due regard which ought to be had such as find out any thing which may be of publick Advantage new Discoveries in Trade in Arts and Mysteries of Manufacturing Goods or Improvement of Land are without question of as great benefit as any Discoveries made in the Works of Nature by all the  Academies  and  Royal Societies  in the world  There is 'tis true a great difference between  New Inventions  and  Projects  between Improvement of Manufactures or Lands which tend to the immediate Benefit of the Publick and Imploying of the Poor and Projects fram'd by subtle Heads with a sort of a  Deceptio Visus  and  Legerdemain  to bring People to run needless and unusual hazards I grant it and give a due preference to the first and yet Success has so sanctifi'd some of  those other sorts of Projects that 'twou'd be a kind of Blasphemy against Fortune to disallow 'em witness Sir  William Phips  's Voyage to the Wreck 'twas a mere Project a Lottery of a Hundred thousand to One odds a hazard which if it had fail'd every body wou'd have been asham'd to have own'd themselves concern'd in a Voyage that wou'd have been as much ridicul'd as  Don Quixot's Adventure upon the Windmill  Bless us that Folks should go Three thousand Miles to Angle in the open Sea for Pieces of Eight why they wou'd have made Ballads of it and the Merchants wou'd have said of every unlikely Adventure 'Twas like  Phips  his WreckVoyage but it had Success and who reflects upon the Project  Nothing's so partial as the Laws of Fate  Erecting Blockheads to suppress the Great  Sir  Francis Drake  the  Spanish  PlateFleet Won  He had been a Pyrate if he had got none  Sir  Walter Rawleigh  strove but miss'd the Plate  And therefore Di'd a Traytor to the State  Endeavour bears a Value more or less  Just as 'tis recommended by Success  The lucky Coxcomb ev'ry Man will prize  And Prosp'rous Actions always pass for Wise  However this sort of Projects comes under no Reflection as to their Honesty save that there is a kind of Honesty a Man owes to himself and to his Family that prohibits him throwing away his Estate in impracticable improbable Adventures but still some hit even of the most unlikely of which this was one of Sir  William Phips  who  brought home a Cargo of Silver of near  l sterling  in Pieces of Eight fish'd up out of the open Sea remote from any shore from an old  Spanish  Ship which had been sunk above Forty Years  THE History of Projects  WHEN I speak of Writing a  History of Projects  I do not mean either of the Introduction of or Continuing necessary Inventions or the Improvement of Arts and Sciences before known but a short Account of Projects and Projecting as the Word is allow'd in the general Acceptation at this present time and I need not go far back for the Original of the Practice  Invention of Arts with Engines and Handycraft Instruments for their Improvement requires a Chronology  as far back as the Eldest Son of  Adam  and has to this day afforded some new Discovery in every Age  The Building of the Ark by  Noah  so far as you will allow it a human Work was the first Project I read of and no question seem'd so ridiculous to the Graver Heads of that Wise tho' Wicked Age that poor  Noah  was sufficiently banter'd for it and had he not been set on work by a very peculiar Direction from Heaven the Good old Man would certainly have been laugh'd out of it as a most senseless ridiculous Project  The Building of  Babel  was a Right Project for indeed the true definition of a Project according to Modern Acceptation is as is said before a vast Undertaking too big to be manag'd and therefore likely enough to come to nothing and yet as great as they are 'tis certainly true of 'em all  even as the Projectors propose that according to the old tale If so many Eggs are hatch'd there will be so many Chickens and those Chickens may lay so many Eggs more and those Eggs produce so many Chickens more and so on Thus 'twas most certainly true That if the People of the Old World cou'd have Built a House up to Heaven they shou'd never be Drown'd again on Earth and they only had forgot to Measure the Heighth  that is  as in other Projects it only Miscarri'd or else 'twou'd have Succeeded  And yet when all's done that very Building and the incredible Heighth it was carri'd is a Demonstration of the vast Knowledge of that InfantAge of the World who had no advantage of the Experiments or Invention of any before themselves  Thus when our Fathers touch'd with Guilt  That  Huge Stupendious StairCase  Built  We Mock indeed the fruitless Enterprize  For fruitless Actions seldom pass for Wise  But were the  Mighty Ruins  left they'd show  To what Degree that Untaught Age did Know  I believe a very diverting Account might be given of this but I shall not attempt it Some are apt to say with  Solomon No new thing happens under the Sun but what is has been  yet I make no question but some considerable Discovery has been made in these latter Ages and Inventions of Human Original produc'd which the World was ever without before either in whole or in part and I refer only to two Cardinal Points the use of the Loadstone at Sea and the  use of Gunpowder and Guns both which as to the Inventingpart I believe the World owes as absolutely to those particular Ages as it does the Working in Brass and Iron to  Tubal Cain  or the Inventing of Musick to  Jubal  his Brother As to Engines and Instruments for HandycraftMen this Age I dare say can show such as never were so much as thought of much less imitated before for I do not call that a real Invention which has something before done like it I account that more properly an Improvement For Handycraft Instruments I know none owes more to true genuine Contrivance without borrowing from any former use than a Mechanick Engine contriv'd in our time call'd  A Knitting Frame  which built with admirable Symetry works really with a very happy Success and may be observ'd by the Curious to have a  more than ordinary Composition for which I refer to the Engine it self to be seen in every StockingWeaver's Garret  I shall trace the Original of the Projecting Humour that now reigns no farther back than the Year dating its Birth as a Monster then tho' by times it had indeed something of life in the time of the late Civil War I allow no Age has been altogether without something of this nature and some very happy Projects are left to us as a taste of their Success as the Waterhouses for supplying of the City of  London  with Water and since that the  NewRiver  both very Considerable Undertakings and Perfect Projects adventur'd on the risque of Success In the Reign of King  Charles  the First infinite Projects were set on foot for Raising Money without a Parliament Oppressing by Monopolies and Privy Seals but  these are excluded our Scheme as Irregularities for thus the  French  are as fruitful in Projects as we and these are rather Stratagems than Projects After the Fire of  London  the Contrivance of an Engine to Quench Fires was a Project the Author was said to get well by and we have found to be very useful But about the Year began the Art and Mystery of Projecting to creep into the World Prince  Rupert  Uncle to King  Charles  the Second gave great Encouragement to that part of it that respects Engines and Mechanical Motions and Bishop  Wilkins  added as much of the Theory to it as writing a Book could do The Prince has left us a Metal call'd by his Name and the first Project upon that was as I remember Casting of Guns of that Metal and boring them done both by a peculiar Method of his own and which died with him  to the great loss of the Undertaker who to that purpose had with no small Charge erected a WaterMill at  HackneyMarsh  known by the name of the  TempleMill  Which Mill very happily perform'd all parts of the Work and I have seen of those Guns on board the Royal  Charles  a Firstrate Ship being of a Reddish Colour different either from Brass or Copper I have heard some Reasons of State assign'd why that Project was not permitted to go forward but I omit them because I have no good Authority for it After this we saw a Floating Machine to be wrought with Horses for the Towing of Great Ships both against Wind and Tide and another for the raising of Ballast which as unperforming Engines had the honour of being Made Expos'd Tri'd and laid by before the Prince died  If thus we introduce it into the World under the Conduct of that Prince when he died 'twas left a hopeless Brat and had hardly any Hand to own it till the WreckVoyage beforenoted perform'd so happily by Captain  Phips  afterwards Sir  William  whose strange Performance set a great many Heads on work to contrive something for themselves he was immediately follow'd by my Lord  Mordant  Sir  John Narborough  and others from several Parts whose Success made 'em soon weary of the Work  The Project of the  PennyPost  so well known and still practis'd I cannot omit nor the Contriver Mr  Dockwra  who has had the honour to have the Injury done him in that Affair repair'd in some measure by the publick Justice of the Parliament And the Experiment proving it to be a Noble and Useful Design the Author must  be remembred whereever mention is made of that Affair to his very great Reputation  'Twas no question a great hardship for a man to be Master of so fine a Thought that had  both  the  Essential Ends of a Project  in it  Publick Good  and  Private Advantage  and that the Publick shou'd reap the benefit and the Author be left out the Injustice of which no doubt discourag'd many a Good Design But since an Alteration in Publick Circumstances has recover'd the lost Attribute of Justice the like is not to be fear'd And Mr  Dockwra  has had the satisfaction to see the former Injury disown'd and an honourable Return made even by them who did not the Injury in bare respect to his Ingenuity  A while before this several People under the Patronage of some great Persons had engag'd in Planting  of Foreign Collonies as  William Pen  the Lord  Shaftsbury  Dr  Cox  and others in  Pensilvania Carolina East  and  West Jersey  and the like places which I do not call Projects because 'twas only prosecuting what had been formerly begun But here began the forming of publick JointStocks which together with the  EastIndia African  and  Hudson'sBay  Companies before establish'd begot a New Trade which we call by a new Name  StockJobbing  which was at first only the simple Occasional Transferring of Interest and Shares from one to another as Persons alienated their Estates but by the Industry of the ExchangeBrokers who got the business into their hands it became a Trade and one perhaps manag'd with the greatest Intriegue Artifice and Trick that ever any thing that appear'd with a face of Honesty  could be handl'd with for while the Brokers held the Box they made the whole  Exchange  the Gamesters and rais'd and lower'd the Prices of Stocks as they pleas'd and always had both Buyers and Sellers who stood ready innocently to commit their Money to the mercy of their Mercenary Tongues This Upstart of a Trade having tasted the sweetness of Success which generally attends a  Novel Proposal  introduces the Illigitimate wandring Object I speak of as a proper Engine to find Work for the Brokers Thus StockJobbing nurs'd Projecting and Projecting in return has very diligently pimp'd for its Fosterparent till both are arriv'd to be Publick Grievances and indeed are now almost grown scandalous  Of PROJECTORS  MAN is the worst of all God's Creatures to shift for himself no other Animal is ever starv'd to death Nature without has provided them both Food and Cloaths and Nature within has plac'd an Instinct that never fails to direct them to proper means for a supply but Man must either  Work or Starve Slave or Dye  he has indeed Reason given him to direct him and few who follow the Dictates of that Reason come to such unhappy Exigencies but when by the Errors of a Man's Youth he has reduc'd himself to such a degree of Distress as to be absolutely without Three things  Money Friends  and  Health  he Dies in a Ditch or in some worse place  an Hospital  Ten thousand ways there are to bring a Man to this and but very few to bring him out again  Death is the universal Deliverer and therefore some who want Courage to bear what they see before 'em  Hang themselves for fear  for certainly Selfdestruction is the effect of Cowardice in the highest extream  Others break the Bounds of Laws to satisfy that general Law of Nature and turn open Thieves Housebreakers Highwaymen Clippers Coiners  c  till they run the length of the Gallows and get a Deliverance the nearest way at St  Tyburn  Others being masters of more Cunning than their Neighbours turn their Thoughts to Private Methods of Trick and Cheat a Modern way of Thieveing every jot as Criminal and in some degree worse than the other by which honest men are gull'd  with fair pretences to part from their Money and then left to take their Course with the Author who sculks behind the curtain of a Protection or in the  Mint  or  Friars  and bids defiance as well to Honesty as the Law  Others yet urg'd by the same necessity turn their thoughts to Honest Invention founded upon the Platform of Ingenuity and Integrity  These two last sorts are those we call  Projectors  and as there was always  more Geese than Swans  the number of the latter are very inconsiderable in comparison of the former and as the greater number denominates the less the just Contempt we have of the former sort bespatters the other who like Cuckolds bear the reproach of other Peoples Crimes  A meer Projector then is a Contemptible thing driven by his own desperate Fortune to such a Streight  that he must be deliver'd by a Miracle or Starve and when he has beat his Brains for some such Miracle in vain he finds no remedy but to paint up some Bauble or other  as Players make Puppets talk big  to show like a strange thing and then cry it up for a New Invention gets a Patent for it divides it into Shares and  they must be Sold  ways and means are not wanting to Swell the new Whim to a vast Magnitude Thousands and Hundreds of thousands are the least of his discourse and sometimes Millions till the Ambition of some honest Coxcomb is wheedl'd to part with his Money for it and then  Nascitur ridiculus mus  the Adventurer is left to carry on the Project and the Projector laughs at him The  Diver  shall walk at the  bottom of the  Thames  the  SaltpeterMaker  shall Build  Tom Tds  Pond into Houses the Engineers Build Models and Windmills to draw Water till Funds are rais'd to carry it on by Men who have more Money than Brains and then  good night Patent and Invention  the Projector has done his business and is gone  But the Honest Projector is he who having by fair and plain principles of Sense Honesty and Ingenuity brought any Contrivance to a suitable Perfection makes out what he pretends to picks no body's pocket puts his Project in Execution and contents himself with the real Produce as the profit of his Invention  Of BANKS  BANKS without question if rightly manag'd are or may be of great Advantage especially to a Trading People as the  English  are and among many others this is one particular case in which that Benefit appears That they bring down the Interest of Money and take from the Goldsmiths Scriveners and others who have command of running Cash their most delicious Trade of making advantage of the necessities of the Merchant in extravagant Discounts and Premio's for advance of Money when either large Customs or Foreign Remittances call for Disbursements beyond his common Ability for by the easiness of Terms on which the Merchant may have Money he is encourag'd to venture further in Trade  than otherwise he would do not but that there are other great advantages a  Royal Bank  might procure in this Kingdom as has been seen in part by this As advancing Money to the  Exchequer  upon Parliamentary Funds and Securities by which in time of a War our Preparations for any Expedition need not be in danger of Miscarriage for want of Money though the Taxes rais'd be not speedily paid nor the  Exchequer  burthen'd with the excessive Interests paid in former Reigns upon Anticipations of the Revenue Landed Men might be supplied with Moneys upon Securities on easier Terms which would prevent the Loss of multitudes of Estates now ruin'd and devour'd by insolent and merciless Mortgagees and the like But now we unhappily see a  Royal Bank  Establish'd by Act of Parliament and another with a large Fund upon the  Orphans  Stock and yet these Advantages or others which we expected not answer'd tho' the pretensions in Both have not been wanting at such time as they found it needful to introduce themselves into publick Esteem by giving out Prints of what they were rather able to do than really intended to practice So that our having Two Banks at this time settl'd and more Erecting has not yet been able to reduce the Interest of Money not because the Nature and Foundation of their Constitution does not tend towards it but because finding their Hands full of better business they are wiser than by being slaves to old obselete Proposals to lose the advantage of the great Improvement they can make of their Stock  This however does not at all reflect on the Nature of a Bank nor of the Benefit it would be to the  publick Tradingpart of the Kingdom whatever it may seem to do on the practice of the present We find Four or Five Banks now in view to be settl'd I confess I expect no more from those to come than we have found from the past and I think I make no breach on either my Charity or  good Manners  in saying so and I reflect not upon any of the Banks that are or shall be Establish'd for not doing what I mention but for making such publications of what they would do I cannot think any Man had expected the  Royal Bank  shou'd Lend Money on Mortgages at  per Cent  nor was it much the better for them to make publication they wou'd do so from the beginning of  January  next after their Settlement since to this day as I am inform'd they have not Lent one Farthing in that manner  Our Banks are indeed nothing but so many Goldsmiths Shops where the Credit being high and the Directors as high People lodge their Money and They the Directors I mean make their advantage of it if you lay it at Demand they allow you nothing if at Time  per Cent  and so wou'd any Goldsmith in  Lombardstreet  have done before but the very Banks themselves are so aukward in Lending so strict so tedions so inquisitive and withal so publick in their taking Securities that Men who are any thing tender won't go to them and so the easiness of Borrowing Money so much design'd is defeated for here is a private Interest to be made tho' it be a publick one and in short 'tis only a great Trade carri'd on for the private Gain of a few concern'd in the Original Stock and tho' we are to hope for great things  because they have promis'd them yet they are all Future that we know of  And yet all this while a Bank might be very beneficial to this Kingdom and This might be so if either their own Ingenuity or Publick Authority would oblige them to take the Publick Good into equal Concern with their Private Interest  To explain what I mean  Banks being establish'd by Publick Authority ought also as all Publick things are to be under Limitations and Restrictions from that Authority and those Limitations being regulated with a proper regard to the Ease of Trade in General and the Improvement of the Stock in Particular would make a Bank a Useful Profitable Thing indeed  First A Bank ought to be of a Magnitude proportion'd to the Trade of the Countrey it is in which this  Bank is so far from that 'tis no more to the Whole than the least Goldsmith's Cash in  Lombardstreet  is to the Bank From whence it comes to pass that already more Banks are contriving and I question not but Banks in  London  will e're long be as frequent as Lotteries The Consequence of which in all Probability will be the diminishing their Reputation or a Civil War with one another 'Tis true the Bank of  England  has a Capital Stock but yet was that Stock wholly clear of the Publick Concern of the Government it is not above a Fifth Part of what would be necessary to manage the whole Business of the Town which it ought tho' not to do at least to be Able to do And I suppose I may venture to say Above one half of the Stock of the present Bank is taken up in the Affairs of the Exchequer  I suppose no body will take this Discourse for an Invective against the Bank of  England  I believe it is a very Good Fund a very Useful one and a very Profitable one It has been Useful to the Government and it is Profitable to the Proprietors and the establishing it at such a Juncture when our Enemies were making great boasts of our Poverty and Want of Money was a particular Glory to our Nation and the City in particular That when the  Paris Gazette  inform'd the World That the Parliament had indeed given the King Grants for raising Money in Funds to be paid in remote Years but Money was so scarce that no Anticipations could be procured That just then besides Three Millions paid into the Exchequer that Spring on other Taxes by way of Advance there was an OverplusStock to be found of Pounds  sterling  or to make  it speak  French  of above Fifteen Millions which was all paid Voluntarily into the Exchequer in less than  Besides this I believe the present Bank of  England  has been very useful to the Exchequer and to supply the King with Remittances for the Payment of the Army in  Flanders  which has also by the way been very profitable to it self But still this Bank is not of that Bulk that the Business done here requires nor is it able with all the Stock it has to procure the great propos'd Benefit the low'ring the Interest of Money Whereas all Foreign Banks absolutely govern the Interest both at  Amsterdam Genoa  and other places And this Defect I conceive the Multiplicity of Banks cannot supply unless a perfect Understanding could be secur'd between them  To remedy this Defect several  Methods might be propos'd Some I shall take the Freedom to hint at  First That the present Bank increase their Stock to at least Five Millions  sterling  to be settled as they are already with some small Limitations to make the Methods more beneficial  Five Millions  sterling  is an immense Sum to which add the Credit of their Cash which would supply them with all the OverplusMoney in the Town and probably might amount to half as much more and then the Credit of RunningBills which by circulating would no question be an Equivalent to the other half So that in Stock Credit and Bankbills the Balance of their Cash would be always Ten Millions  sterling  A Sum that every body who can talk of does not understand  But then to find Business for all this Stock which though it be a  strange thing to think of is nevertheless easy when it comes to be examin'd And first for the Business This Bank shou'd enlarge the Number of their Directors as they do of their Stock and should then establish several SubCommittees compos'd of their own Members who should have the directing of several Offices relating to the distinct sorts of Business they referr'd to to be overrul'd and govern'd by the Governor and Directors in a Body but to have a Conclusive Power as to Contracts Of these there should be  One Office for Loan of Money for Customs of Goods which by a plain Method might be so order'd that the Merchant might with ease pay the highest Customs down and so by allowing the Bank  per Cent  Advance be first sure to secure the  l per Cent  which the King allows for Prompt  Payment at the  Customhouse  and be also freed from the troublesome work of finding  BondsMen  and Securities for the Money which has expos'd many a Man to the Tyranny of Extents either for himself or his Friend to his utter Ruin who under a more moderate Prosecution had been able to pay all his Debts and by this Method has been torn to pieces and disabled from making any tolerable Proposal to his Creditors This is a Scene of Large Business and would in proportion employ a Large Cash And 'tis the easiest thing in the world to make the Bank the Paymaster of all the Large Customs and yet the Merchant have so honourable a Possession of his Goods as may be neither any Diminution to his Reputation or any Hindrance to their Sale  As for Example  Suppose I have Hogsheads of  Tobacco to Import whose Customs by several Duties comes to  l  and want Cash to clear them I go with my Bill of Loading to the Bank who appoint their Officer to Enter the Goods and pay the Duties which Goods so entred by the Bank shall give them Title enough to any part or the whole without the trouble of Bills of Sale or Conveyances Defeazances and the like The Goods are carried to a Warehouse at the Waterside where the Merchant has a Free and Publick Access to them as if in his own Warehouse and an honourable Liberty to sell and deliver either the Whole paying their Disburse or a Part without it leaving but sufficient for the Payment and out of that Part delivered either by Notes under the Hand of the Purchaser or any other way he may clear the same without any Exactions but  of  l per Cent  and the rest are his own  The ease this wou'd bring to Trade the deliverance it wou'd bring to the Merchants from the insults of Goldsmiths  c  and the honour it wou'd give to our management of Publick Imposts with the advantages to the CustomHouse it self and the utter destruction of Extortion wou'd be such as wou'd give a due value to the Bank and make all Mankind acknowledge it to be a publick good The Grievance of Exactions upon Merchants in this case is very great and when I lay the blame on the Goldsmiths because they are the principal People made use of in such occasions I include a great many other sorts of Brokers and Moneyjobbing Artists who all get a snip out of the Merchant I my self have known a Goldsmith in  Lumbardstreet  Lend a Man    l  to pay the Customs of a Hundred Pipes of  Spanish  Wines the Wines were made over to him for Security by Bill of Sale and put into a Cellar of which the Goldsmith kept the Key the Merchant was to pay  l per Cent  Interest on the Bond and to allow  l per Cent  Premio for advancing the Money When he had the Wines in Possession the Owner cou'd not send his Cooper to look after them but the Goldsmith's Man must attend all the while for which he wou'd be paid  s  a day If he brought a Customer to see them the Goldsmith's Man must show them the Money was Lent for Two Months he cou'd not be admitted to Sell or Deliver a Pipe of Wine out single or Two or Three at a time as he might have Sold them but on a word or two spoken amiss to the Goldsmith  or which he was pleased to take so  he wou'd have none Sold but the whole Parcel together by this usage the Goods lay on hand and every Month the Money remain'd the Goldsmith demanded a Guinea  per Cent  forbearance besides the Interest till at last by Leakage Decay and other Accidents the Wines began to lessen Then the Goldsmith begins to tell the Merchant he is afraid the Wines are not worth the Money he has Lent and demands further Security and in a little while growing higher and rougher he tells him he must have his Money the Merchant too much at his Mercy because he cannot provide the Money is forc'd to consent to the Sale and the Goods being reduc'd to Seventy Pipes sound Wine and Four unsound the rest being sunk for filling up were Sold for  l per  Pipe the Sound and  l  the Unsound which amounted to  l  together     l  s  d  The Coopers Bill came to        The Cellerage a Year and Half to        Interests on the Bond to        The Goldsmith's Men for Attendance        Allowance for Advance of the Money and Forbearance                 Principal Money Borrow'd                 Due to the Merchant                 By the modetatest Computation that can be these Wines Cost the Merchant as follows  First Cost with Charges on Board  l  s  d  In  Lisbon    Mille Reis  per Pipe is  Mill Re  Exchange at s d per  Mille Rei        Freight to  London  then at l per Ton        Assurance on l at per C        Petty Charges                 So that 'tis manifest by the Extortion of this Banker the poor Man lost the whole Capital with Freight and Charges and made but  l  produce of a Hunder'd Pipes of Wine  One other Office of this Bank and which wou'd take up a considerable branch of the Stock is for Lending Money upon Pledges which shou'd have annex'd to it a Warehouse and Factory where all sorts of Goods might publickly be Sold by the Consent of the Owners to the great Advantage of the Owner the Bank receiving  l per Cent  Interest and  per Cent  Commission for Sale of the Goods  A Third Office shou'd be appointed for Discounting Bills Tallies and Notes by which all Tallies of the  Exchequer  and any part of the Revenue shou'd at stated Allowances be ready Money to any Person to the great Advantage of the Government  and ease of all such as are any ways concern'd in publick Undertakings  A Fourth Office for Lending Money upon LandSecurities at  per Cent  Interest by which the Cruelty and Injustice of Mortgagees wou'd be wholly restrain'd and a Register of Mortgages might be very well kept to prevent Frauds  A Fifth Office for Exchanges and Foreign Correspondences  A Sixth for Inland Exchanges where a very large Field of Business lies before them  Under this Head 'twill not be improper to consider that this Method will most effectually answer all the Notions and Proposals of CountyBanks for by this Office they wou'd be all render'd useless and unprofitable since One Bank of the Magnitude I mention with a Branch of its Office set apart for that Business might with  ease Manage all the InlandExchange of the Kingdom  By which such a Correspondence with all the TradingTowns in  England  might be maintain'd as that the whole Kingdom shou'd Trade with the Bank Under the Direction of this Office a Publick Cashier shou'd be appointed in every County to reside in the Capital Town as to Trade and in some Counties more through whose Hands all the Cash of the Revenue of the Gentry and of Trade shou'd be return'd on the Bank in  London  and from the Bank again on their Cashier in every respective County or Town at the small Exchange of ½  per Cent  by which means all loss of Money carri'd upon the Road to the encouragement of Robbers and Ruining of the Countrey who are Su'd for those Robberies wou'd be more effectually prevented than by all the  Statutes against HighwayMen that are or can be made  As to Publick Advancings of Money to the Government they may be left to the Directors in a Body as all other Disputes and Contingent cases are and whoever examines these Heads of Business apart and has any Judgment in the Particulars will I suppose allow that a Stock of Ten Millions may find Employment in them though it be indeed a very great Sum  I cou'd offer some very good Reasons why this way of Management by particular Offices for every particular sort of Business is not only the easiest but the safest way of executing an Affair of such variety and consequence also I cou'd state a Method for the Proceedings of those private Offices their Conjunction with and Dependence on the General  Court of the Directors and how the various Accompts shou'd Center in one General Capital account of Stock with Regulations and Appeals but I believe them to be needless at least in this place  If it be Objected here That it is impossible for One Joint Stock to go thorough the whole Business of the Kingdom I Answer I believe it is not either impossible or impracticable particularly on this one account that almost all the Country Business wou'd be Manag'd by runningBills and those the longest abroad of any their distance keeping them out to the Increasing the Credit and consequently the Stock of the Bank  Of the Multiplicity of  Banks  What is touch'd at in the foregoing part of this Chapter refers to  One  BankRoyal  to Preside as it were over the whole Cash of the Kingdom But because some People do suppose this Work fitter for many Banks than for One I must a little consider that Head And first allowing those many Banks cou'd without clashing maintain a constant Correspondence with one another in passing each others Bills as Current from one to another I know not but it might be better perform'd by Many than by One for as Harmony makes Musick in Sound so it produces Success in Business  A  Civil War  among Merchants is always the Ruin of Trade I cannot think a Multitude of Banks cou'd so consist with one another in  England  as to join Interests and uphold one another's Credit without joining Stocks too I confess if it cou'd be done the Convenience to Trade wou'd be Visible  If I were to Propose which way these Banks shou'd be Establish'd I answer Allowing a due regard to some Gentlemen who have had thoughts of the same whose Methods I shall not so much as touch upon much less discover My thoughts run upon quite different Methods both for the Fund and the Establishment  Every principal Town in  England  is a Corporation upon which the Fund may be settled which will sufficiently answer the difficult and chargeable work of Suing for a Corporation by Patent or Act of Parliament  A general Subscription of Stock being made and by Deeds of Settlement plac'd in the Mayor and Aldermen of the City or Corporation for the time being in Trust to be declared by Deeds of Uses some of the Directors being always made Members of the said Corporation and  join'd in the Trust the Bank hereby becomes the Publick Stock of the Town something like what they call the  Rents of the TownHouse  in  France  and is Manag'd in the Name of the said Corporation to whom the Directors are Accountable and they back again to the General Court  For Example  Suppose the Gentlemen or Tradesmen of the County of  Norfolk  by a Subscription of Cash design to Establish a Bank The Subscriptions being made the Stock is paid into the Chamber of the City of  Norwich  and manag'd by a Court of Directors as all Banks are and chosen out of the Subscribers the Mayor only of the City to be always one to be managed in the Name of the Corporation of the City of  Norwich  but for the Uses in a Deed of Trust to be made by the Subscribers and Mayor and  Aldermen at large mentioned I make no question but a Bank thus settled wou'd have as firm a Foundation as any Bank need to have and every way answer the Ends of a Corporation  Of these sorts of Banks  England  might very well establish Fifteen at the several Towns hereafter mention'd Some of which tho they are not the Capital Towns of the Counties yet are more the Center of Trade which in  England  runs in Veins like Mines of Metal in the Earth  Canterbury  Salisbury  Exeter  Bristol  Worcester  Shrewsbury  Manchester  Newcastle upon Tyne  Leeds  or  Halifax  or  York  Nottingham  Warwick  or  Birmingham  Oxford  or  Reading  Bedford  Norwich  Colchester  Every one of these Banks to have a Cashier in  London  unless they cou'd all have a general Correspondence and Credit with the BankRoyal  These Banks in their respective Counties should be a General Staple and Factory for the Manufactures of the said County where every man that had Goods made might have Money at a small Interest for Advance the Goods in the mean time being sent forward to Market to a Warehouse for that purpose erected in  London  where they shou'd be dispos'd of to all the Advantages the Owner cou'd expect paying only  per Cent  Commission Or if the Maker wanted Credit in  London  either for  Spanish  Wool Cotton Oyl or any Goods while his Goods were in the Warehouse of the said Bank his Bill shou'd be paid by the Bank to the full Value of his Goods or at least within a small  matter These Banks either by Correspondence with each other or an Order to their Cashier in  London  might with ease so pass each other's Bills that a man who has Cash at  Plymouth  and wants Money at  Berwick  may transfer his Cash at  Plymouth  to  Newcastle  in half an hours time without either Hazard or Charge or Time allowing only ½  per Cent  Exchange and so of all the most distant parts of the Kingdom Or if he wants Money at  Newcastle  and has Goods at  Worcester  or at any other CloathingTown sending his Goods to be sold by the Factory of the Bank of  Worcester  he may remit by the Bank to  Newcastle  or any where else as readily as if his Goods were sold and paid for and no Exactions made upon him for the Convenience he enjoys  This Discourse of Banks the Reader  is to understand to have no relation to the present Posture of Affairs with respect to the Scarcity of Currant Money which seems to have put a stop to that part of a Stock we call Credit which always is and indeed must be the most essential part of a Bank and without which no Bank can pretend to subsist at least to Advantage  A Bank is only a Great Stock of Money put together to be employ'd by some of the Subscribers in the name of the rest for the Benefit of the Whole This Stock of Money subsists not barely on the Profits of its own Stock for that wou'd be inconsiderable but upon the Contingences and Accidents which Multiplicity of Business occasions As for Instance A man that comes for Money and knows he may have it Tomorrow perhaps he is in haste and won't take  it to day Only that he may be sure of it to morrow he takes a  Memorandum  under the Hand of the Officer That he shall have it whenever he calls for it and this  Memorandum  we call a Bill To morrow when he Intended to fetch his Money comes a Man to him for Money and to save himself the labour of Telling he gives him the  Memorandum  or Bill aforesaid for his Money this Second Man does as the First and a Third does as he did and so the Bill runs about a Month Two or Three and this is that we call  Credit  for by the Circulation of a quantity of these Bills the Bank enjoys the full Benefit of as much Stock in real Value as the supposititious Value of the Bills amounts to and whereever this Credit fails this Advantage fails for immediately all men come for their Money and the Bank must die of it  self for I am sure no Bank by the simple Improvement of their single Stock can ever make any considerable Advantage  I confess a Bank who can lay a Fund for the Security of their Bills which shall produce first an Annual Profit to the Owner and yet make good the PassantBill may stand and be advantageous too because there is a Real and a Supposititious Value both and the Real always ready to make good the Supposititious and this I know no way to bring to pass but by Land which at the same time that it lies Transferr'd to secure the Value of every Bill given out brings in a separate Profit to the Owner and this way no question but the whole Kingdom might be a Bank to it self tho' no ready Money were to be found in it  I had gone on in some Sheets  with my Notion of Land being the best bottom for Publick Banks and the easiness of bringing it to answer all the Ends of Money deposited with double Advantage but I find my self happily prevented by a Gentleman who has publish'd the very same tho' since this was Wrote and I was always Master of so much Wit as to hold my Tongue while they spoke who understood the thing better than my self  Mr  John Asgill  of  LincolnsInn  in a small Tract Entituled  Several Assertions prov'd in Order to Create another Species of Money than Gold and Silver  has so distinctly handled this very Case with such strength of Argument such clearness of Reason such a Judgment and such a Stile as all the Ingenious part of the World must acknowledge themselves extremely Oblig'd to him for that Piece  At the sight of which Book I laid by all that had been written by me on that Subject for I had much rather confess my self incapable of handling that Point like him than have convinc'd the World of it by my impertinence  Of the HIGHWAYS  IT is a prodigious Charge the whole Nation groans under for the Repair of HighWays which after all lie in a very ill Posture too I make no question but if it was taken into Consideration by those who have the Power to Direct it the Kingdom might be wholly eas'd of that Burthen and the HighWays be kept in good condition which now lie in a most shameful manner in most  parts of the Kingdom and in many places wholly unpassable from whence arise Tolls and Impositions upon Passengers and Travellers and on the other hand Trespasses and Incroachments upon Lands adjacent to the great Damage of the Owners  The Rate for the HighWays is the most Arbitrary and Unequal Tax in the Kingdom in some places two or three Rates of  d per l  in the year in others the whole Parish cannot raise wherewith to defray the Charge either by the very bad condition of the Road or distance of Materials in others the Surveyors raise what they never Expend and the Abuses Exactions Connivances Frauds and Embezlements are innumerable  The  Romans  while they Govern'd this Island made it one of their principal cares to Make and Repair the HighWays of the Kingdom and the  Chief Roads we now use are of their Marking out the Consequence of maintaining them was such or at least so esteem'd that they thought it not below them to Employ their  Legionary Troops  in the Work and it was sometimes the Business of whole Armies either when in Winterquarters or in the intervals of Truce or Peace with the Natives Nor have the  Romans  left us any greater tokens of their Grandeur and Magnificence than the ruins of those Causways and Streetways which are at this day to be seen in many parts of the Kingdom some of which has by the visible Remains been discover'd to traverse the whole Kingdom and others for more than an Hundred Miles are to be trac'd from Colony to Colony as they had particular occasion The famous HighWay or Street call'd  Watlingstreet  which some will tell you began  at  Londonstone  and passing that very Street in the City which we to this day call by that Name went on  West  to that spot where  Tyburn  now stands and then turn'd  NorthWest  in so straight a line to St  Albans  that 'tis now the exactest Road in one Line for Twenty Miles in the Kingdom and tho' disus'd now as the Chief yet is as good and I believe the best Road to St  Albans  and is still call'd the  Streetway  From whence it is trac'd into  Shropshire  above an Hundred and sixty Miles with a multitude of visible Antiquities upon it Discover'd and Describ'd very Acurately by Mr  Cambden  The  Fosse  another  Roman  Work lies at this day as visible and as plain a high Causway of above Thirty Foot broad Ditch'd on either side and Cop'd and Pav'd where need is as exact and every jot as beautiful as the King's new  Road through  HidePark  in which figure it now lies from near  Marshfield  to  Cirencester  and again from  Cirencester  to the Hill Three Miles on this side  Gloucester  which is not less than Twenty six Miles and is made use of as the great Road to those Towns and probably has been so for a Thousand Years with little Repairs  If we set aside the Barbarity and Customs of the  Romans  as  Heathens  and take them as a Civil Government we must allow they were the Pattern of the whole World for Improvement and Increase of Arts and Learning Civilizing and Methodizing Nations and Countries Conquer'd by their Valour and if this was one of their great Cares That consideration ought to move something But to the great Example of that Generous People I'le add Three Arguments  'Tis Useful and that as 'tis convenient for Carriages which in a Trading Countrey is a great help to Negoce and promotes universal Correspondence without which our Inland Trade cou'd not be manag'd And under this Head I cou'd name a  thousand  Conveniences of a safe pleasant wellRepair'd HighWay both to the Inhabitant and the Traveller but I think 'tis needless  'Tis easy I question not to make it appear 'tis easy to put all the High Roads especially in  England  in a noble Figure Large Dry and Clean well Drein'd and free from Floods unpassable Sloughs deep Cartrouts high Ridges and all the Inconveniences they now are full of and when once done much easier still to be maintain'd so  It may be Cheaper and the whole Assesment for the Repairs of  HighWays for ever be Drop'd or Appli'd to other uses for the Publick Benefit  Here I beg the Reader's Favour for a small Digression  I am not Proposing this as an Undertaker or setting a Price to the Publick for which I will perform it  like one of the Projectors I speak of  but laying open a Project for the Performance which whenever the Publick Affairs will admit our Governors to Consider of will be found so feasible that no question they may find Undertakers enough for the Performance and in this UndertakingAge I do not doubt but 'twou'd be easy at any time to procure Persons at their own Charge to perform it for any single County as a Pattern and Experiment for the whole Kingdom  The Proposal is as follows  First That an Act of Parliament be made with Liberty for the Undertakers to Dig and Trench to cut down Hedges and Trees or whatever is needful for ditching dreining and carrying off Water cleaning enlarging and levelling the Roads with Power to lay open or inclose Lands to incroach into Lands dig raise and level Fences plant and pull up Hedges or Trees for the enlarging widening and dreining the HighWays with Power to turn either the Roads or WaterCourses Rivers and Brooks as by the Directors of the Works shall be found needful  always allowing  satisfaction to be first made to the Owners of such Lands either by assigning to them equivalent Lands or Payment in Money the Value to  be adjusted by Two indifferent Persons to be Named by the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper for the time being and no WaterCourse to be turn'd from any WaterMill without Satisfaction first made both to the Landlord and Tenant  But before I proceed I must say a word or two to this Article  The Chief and almost the Only Cause of the deepness and foulness of the Roads is occasion'd by the standing Water which for want of due care to draw it off by scouring and opening Ditches and Dreins and other WaterCourses and clearing of Passages soaks into the Earth and softens it to such a degree that it cannot bear the weight of Horses and Carriages to prevent which the Power to Dig Trench and Cut down  c  mention'd above will be of absolute necessity But because the liberty  seems very large and some may think 'tis too great a Power to be granted to any Body of Men over their Neighbours 'Tis answer'd  'Tis absolutely necessary or the Work cannot be done and the doing of the Work is of much greater Benefit than the Damage can amount to  Satisfaction to be made to the Owner and that first too before the Damage be done is an Unquestionable Equivalent and Both together I think are a very full Answer to any Objection in That case  Besides this Act of Parliament a Commission must be granted to Fifteen at least in the Name of the Undertakers to whom every County shall have Power to join Ten who are to Sit with the said Fifteen so often and so long as the said Fifteen do Sit for Affairs relating to that County which Fifteen or any Seven of them  shall be Directors of the Works to be advis'd by the said Ten or any Five of them in matters of Right and Claim and the said Ten to adjust Differences in the Countries and to have Right by Process to appeal in the name either of Lords of Mannors or Privileges of Towns or Corporations who shall be either damag'd or encroach'd upon by the said Work All Appeals to be heard and determin'd immediately by the said Lord Chancellor or Commission from him that the Work may receive no Interruption  This Commission shall give Power to the said Fifteen to press Wagons Carts and Horses Oxen and Men and detain them to work a certain Limited Time and within certain Limited Space of Miles from their own Dwellings and at a certain Rate of Payment No Men Horses or Carts to be press'd against their Consent during  the times of Haytime or Harvest or upon Marketdays if the Person aggriev'd will make Affidavit he is oblig'd to be with his Horses or Carts at the said Markets  It is well known to all who have any knowledge of the Condition the HighWays in  England  now lye in that in most places there is a convenient distance of Land left open for travelling either for driving of Cattel or marching of Troops of Horse with perhaps as few Lanes or  Defiles  as in any Countries The CrossRoads which are generally Narrow are yet Broad enough in most places for two Carriages to pass but on the other hand we have on most of the HighRoads a great deal of wasteLand thrown in as it were for an Overplus to the HighWay which though it be us'd of course by Cattle and Travellers on occasion is indeed no Benefit  at all either to the Traveller as a Road or to the Poor as a Common or to the Lord of the Mannor as a Waste upon it grows neither Timber nor Grass in any quantity answerable to the Land but tho to no purpose is trodden down poach'd and overrun by Drifts of Cattle in the Winter or spoil'd with the Dust in the Summer And this I have observ'd in many parts of  England  to be as good Land as any of the Neighbouring Enclosures as capable of Improvement and to as good purpose  These Lands only being enclos'd and manur'd leaving the Roads to Dimensions without measure sufficient are the Fund upon which I build the Prodigious Stock of Money that must do this Work These Lands which I shall afterwards make an Essay to value being enclos'd will be either saleable to raise Money or fit to exchange  with those Gentlemen who must part with some Land where the Ways are narrow Always reserving a quantity of these Lands to be Let out to Tenants the Rent to be paid into the Publick Stock or Bank of the Undertakers and to be reserv'd for keeping the Ways in the same Repair and the said Bank to forfeit the Lands if they are not so maintained  Another Branch of the Stock must be Hands for a Stock of Men is a Stock of Money to which purpose every County City Town and Parish shall be Rated at a Set Price equivalent to Eight Years Payment for the Repair of Highways which each County  c  shall raise not by Assessment in Money but by pressing of Men Horses and Carriages for the Work the Men Horses  c  to be employ'd by the Directors In which case all Corporal Punishments  as of  Whippings Stocks Pillories Houses of Correction c  might be easily transmitted to a certain Number of Days Works on the HighWays and in Consideration of this provision of Men the Country shou'd for ever after be acquitted of any Contribution either in Money or Work for Repair of the HighWays Building of Bridges excepted  There lies some Popular Objection against this Undertaking and the first is the great Controverted Point of  England Enclosure of the Common  which tends to Depopulation and Injures the Poor  Who shall be Judges or Surveyors of the Work to Oblige the Undertakers to perform to a certain limited degree  For the First The Enclosure of the Common A Clause that runs as far as to an Incroachment upon  Magna  Charta  and a most considerable branch of the Property of the Poor I Answer it thus  The Lands we Enclose are not such as from which the Poor do indeed reap any Benefit or at least any that is considerable  The Bank and Publick Stock who are to Manage this great Undertaking will have so many little Labours to perform and Offices to bestow that are fit only for Labouring Poor Persons to do as will put them in a condition to provide for the Poor who are so Injur'd that can work and to those who cannot may allow Pensions for Overseeing Supervising and the like which will be more than Equivalent  For Depopulations the contrary shou'd be secur'd by obliging the Undertakers at such and such certain distances to erect Cottages Two at least  in a place which wou'd be useful to the Work and safety of the Traveller to which shou'd be an Allotment of Land always sufficient to invite the Poor Inhabitant in which the Poor shou'd be Tenant for Life  Gratis  doing Duty upon the HighWay as shou'd be appointed by which and many other Methods the Poor shou'd be great Gainers by the Proposal instead of being Injur'd  By this erecting of Cottages at proper distances a Man might Travel over all  England  as through a Street where he cou'd never want either Rescue from Thieves or Directions for his way  This very Undertaking once duly settled might in a few Years so order it that there shou'd be no Poor for the Common and if so What need of a Common for the Poor Of which in its proper place  As to the second Objection Who shou'd oblige the Undertakers to the Performance  I Answer Their Commission and Charter shou'd become Void and all their Stock Forfeit and the Lands Enclosed and Unsold remain as a Pledge which wou'd be Security sufficient  The Ten Persons chosen out of every County shou'd have Power to Inspect and Complain and the Lord Chancellor upon such Complaint to make a Survey and to determine by a Jury in which case on Default they shall be oblig'd to proceed  The Lands settled on the Bank shall be liable to be extended for the Uses mentioned if the same at any time be not maintained in the condition at first provided and the Bank to be amerc'd upon Complaint of the Countrey  These and other Conditions which on a Legal Settlement to be made by Wiser Heads than mine might be thought on I do believe wou'd form a Constitution so firm so fair and so equally Advantageous to the Country to the Poor and to the Publick as has not been put in practice in these latter Ages of the World To Discourse of this a little in general and to instance in a Place perhaps that has not its fellow in the Kingdom the Parish of  Islington  in  Middlesex  there lies through this large Parish the greatest Road in  England  and the most frequented especially by Cattle for  Smithfield  Market this great Road has so many Branches and lies for so long a way through the Parish and withal has the inconvenience of a Clayey Ground and no Gravel at hand that modestly speaking the Parish is not able to keep it in Repair by which  means several CrossRoads in the Parish lie wholly Unpassable and Carts and Horses and Men too have been almost Buried in Holes and Sloughs and the main Road it self has for many Years lain in a very ordinary condition which occasion'd several Motions in Parliament to Raise a Toll at  Highgate  for the performance of what it was impossible the Parish shou'd do and yet was of so absolute necessity to be done And is it not very probable the Parish of  Islington  wou'd part with all the waste Land upon their Roads to be eas'd of the intolerable Assessment for Repair of the HighWay and answer the Poor who reap but a small Benefit from it some other way And yet I am free to affirm That for a Grant of Waste and almost useless Land lying open to the HighWay those Lands to be improv'd as they might easily be together with the Eight  Years Assessment to be provided in Workmen a noble Magnificent Causeway might be Erected with Ditches on either side deep enough to receive the Water and Dreins sufficient to carry it off which Causway shou'd be Four Foot High at least and from Thirty to Forty Foot Broad to reach from  London  to  Barnet  pav'd in the middle to keep it Cop'd and so suppli'd with Gravel and other proper Materials as shou'd secure it from Decay with small Repairing  I hope no Man wou'd be so weak now as to imagine that by Lands lying open to the Road to be Assign'd to the Undertakers I shou'd mean that all  Finchly  Common shou'd be Enclos'd and Sold for this Work but least somebody shou'd start such a preposterous Objection I think 'tis not improper to mention That whereever a HighWay is to be carri'd over a  Large Common Forest or Waste without a Hedge on either hand for a certain distance there the several Parishes shall allot the Directors a certain quantity of the Common to lie Parallel with the Road at a proportioned number of Feet to the Length and Breadth of the said Road consideration also to be had to the Nature of the Ground or else giving them only room for the Road directly shall suffer them to Enclose in any one Spot so much of the said Common as shall be equivalent to the like quantity of Land lying by the Road thus where the Land is good and the Materials for erecting a Causway near the less Land may serve and on the contrary the more but in general allowing them the quantity of Land proportioned to the length of the Causway and Forty Rod in Breadth tho' where the Land is poor as on Downs and  Plains the Proportion must be consider'd to be adjusted by the Country  Another Point for the Dimensions of Roads shou'd be adjusted and the Breadth of them I think cannot be less than thus  From  London  every way Miles the High PostRoad to be Built full Foot in Breadth and Foot High the Ditches Foot Broad and Foot Deep and from thence onward Foot and so in Proportion  Cross Roads to be Foot Broad and Ditches Proportion'd no Lanes and Passes less than Foot without Ditches  The Middle of the High Causeways to be Pav'd with Stone Chalk or Gravel and kept always Two Foot Higher than the Sides that the Water might have a free course into the Ditches and Persons kept in constant Employ  to fill up Holes let out Water open Dreins and the like as there shou'd be occasion A proper Work for Highwaymen and such Malefactors as might on those Services be exempt'd from the Gallows  It may here be Objected That Eight Years Assessment to be demanded down is too much in reason to expect any of the Poorer sort can pay as for Instance If a Farmer who keeps a Team of Horse be at the common Assessment to Work a Week it must not be put so hard upon any Man as to Work Eight Weeks together 'Tis easy to Answer this Objection  So many as ate wanted must be had if a Farmer's Team cannot be spar'd without prejudice to him so long together he may spare it at sundry times or agree to be Assess'd and pay the Assessment at sundry Payments  and the Bank may make it as easy to them as they please  Another Method however might be found to fix this Work at once As suppose a Bank be settled for the Highways of the County of  Middlesex  which as they are without doubt the most us'd of any in the Kingdom so also they require the more Charge and in some Parts lie in the worst Condition of any in the Kingdom  If the Parliament fix the Charge of the Survey of the HighWays upon a Bank to be Appointed for that Purpose for a certain term of Years the Bank Undertaking to do the Work or to Forfeit the said Settlement  As thus  Suppose the Tax on Land and Tenements for the whole County of  Middlesex  does or shou'd be so order'd as it might amount to  l per Ann  more or less which it now  does and much more including the Work of the Farmer's Teams which must be accounted as Money and is equivalent to it with some Allowance to be Rated for the City of  London c  who do enjoy the Benefit and make the most use of the said Roads both for carrying of Goods and bringing Provisions to the City and therefore in reason ought to Contribute towards the Highways for it is a most unequal thing that the Road from  Highgate  to  Smithfield  Market by which the whole City is in a manner suppli'd with Live Cattel and the Road by those Cattel horribly spoil'd shou'd lie all upon that one Parish of  Islington  to Repair wherefore I'le suppose a Rate for the Highways to be gather'd through the City of  London  of  l per Ann  more which may be Appointed to be paid by Carriers Drovers and all such as keep Teams  Horses or Coaches and the like or many ways as is most Equal and Reasonable the waste Lands in the said County which by the Consent of the Parishes Lords of the Mannors and Proprietors shall be allow'd to the Undertakers when Enclos'd and Let out may the Land in  Middlesex  generally Letting high amount to  l per Ann  more If then an Act of Parliament be procur'd to settle the Tax of  l per Ann  for Eight Years most of which will be Levi'd in Workmen and not in Money and the Waste Lands for ever I dare be bold to offer That the HighWays for the whole County of  Middlesex  shou'd be put into the following Form and the  l per Ann  Land be bound to remain as a Security to maintain them so and the County be never Burthen'd with any further Tax for the Repair of the HighWays  And that I may not Propose a Matter in General like begging the Question without Demonstration I shall enter into the Particulars How it may be perform'd and that under these following Heads of Articles  What I Propose to do to the HighWays  What the Charge will be  How to be Rais'd  What Security for Performance  What Profit to the Undertaker  What I Propose to do to the HighWays  I Answer First Not Repair them And yet Secondly Not alter them  that is  not alter the Course they run  But perfectly Build them as a Fabrick And to descend to the Particulars  'tis first necessary to Note which are the Roads I mean and their Dimensions  First The  High PostRoads  and they are for the County of  Middlesex  as follows        Miles  From  London  to  Stanes  which is    Colebrook  is from  Hounslow    Uxbridge    Bushy  the Old Streetway    Barnet  or near it    WalthamCross  in  Ware  Road    Bow            Besides these there are CrossRoads ByRoads and Lanes which must also be look'd after and that some of them may be put into Condition others may be wholly slighted and shut up or made  Driftways Bridleways  or  Footways  as may be thought convenient by the Countries  The CrossRoads of most Repute are as follows              Miles  From  London  to  Hackney Old Ford  and  Bow    Hackney  Dalston  and  Islington    Ditto  Hornsy MuzzleHill  to  Whetston    Tottenham  The  Chase SouthGate  c call'd  Greenlanes    EnfieldWash  EnfieldTown Whetston Totteridge  to  Egworth    London  Hamstead Hendon  and  Edgworth    Edgworth  Stanmore  to  Pinner  to  Uxbridge    London  Harrow  and  PinnerGreen    London  Chelsea Fullham    Brantford  Thistleworth Twittenham  and  Kingston    Kingston  Stanes Colebrook  and  Uxbridge    Ditto  CherseyBridge                  Overplus Miles                  And because there may be many Parts of the CrossRoads which cannot be accounted in the Number abovemention'd or may slip my knowledge or memory I allow an overplus of Miles to be added to the Miles above which together makes the CrossRoads of  Middlesex  to be Miles  For the ByLanes such as may be slighted need nothing but to be ditch'd up such as are for private use of Lands for carrying off Corn and driving Cattle are to be look'd after by private hands  But of the last sort not to be accounted by Particulars in the small County of  Middlesex  we cannot allow less in Cross Bylanes from Village to Village and from DwellingHouses which stand out of the way to the Roads than Miles  So in the whole County I reckon up     Miles  Of the High PostRoad    Of CrossRoads less Publick    Of ByLanes and Passes         These are the Roads I mean and thus divided under their several denominations  To the Question What I wou'd do to them I Answer  For the Miles of High PostRoad I Propose to throw up a firm strong Causway well bottom'd Foot high in the middle and Foot on the side fac'd with Brick or Stone and crown'd with Gravel Chalk or Stone as the several Countries they are made through will afford being Foot in Breadth with Ditches on either side Foot Broad and Foot Deep so the whole Breadth will be Foot if the Ground will permit  At the end of every Two Miles or such like convenient distances shall be a Cottage Erected with Half an Acre of Ground allow'd which shall be given  Gratis  with  s per  Week Wages to such Poor Man of the Parish as shall be approv'd who shall Once at least every day view his Walk to open Passages for the Water  to run into the Ditches to fill up Holes or soft Places  Two Riders shall be allow'd to be always moving the Rounds to view every thing out of Repair and make Report to the Directors and to see that the Cottagers do their Duty  For the Miles of CrossRoad a like Causway to be made but of different Dimensions the Breadth Foot if the Ground will allow it the Ditches Foot Broad Foot Deep the Heighth in the middle Foot and on the sides Foot or where it may be needful to be also crown'd with Gravel and  s per  Week to be allow'd to the Poor of every Parish the Constables to be Bound to find a Man to Walk on the HighWay every Division for the same Purpose as the Cottagers do on the Greater Roads  Posts to be set up at every turning  to Note whither it goes for the Direction of Strangers and how many Miles distant  For a Miles ByLanes only good and sufficient Care to keep them in Repair as they are and to carry the Water off by clearing and cutting the Ditches and laying Materials where it is wanted  This is what I Propose to do to them and what if once perform'd I suppose all People wou'd own to be an Undertaking both Useful and Honourable  The Second Question I Propose to give an Account of is What the Charge will be  Which I account thus  The Work of the great Causway I Propose shall not Cost less than  s per  Foot supposing Materials to be Bought Carriage and Mens Labour to be all Hir'd which for  Miles in Length is no less than the Sum of Pounds as thus  Every Mile accounted at Yards and Foot to the Yard is Foot which at  s per  Foot is  l per  Mile and that again Multiplied by makes the sum of into which I include the Charge of WaterCourses Mills to throw off Water where needful Dreins  c  To this Charge must be added Ditching to Enclose Land for Cottages and Building Cottages at  l  each which is  l  The Work of the smaller Causway I Propose to finish at the Rate of  d per  Foot which being for Miles in Length at Foot  per  Mile amounts to  l  Ditching Dreining and Repairing Miles suppos'd at  s per  Rod as for Rod is  l  which  added to the Two former Accounts is thus     l  The High PostRoads or the Great Cawsey    The small Cawsey    By Lanes  c         If I were to Propose some Measures for the easing this Charge I cou'd perhaps lay a Scheme down how it may be perform'd for less than one half of this Charge  As first By a grant of the Court at the  OldBaily  whereby all such Criminals as are Condemn'd to Die for smaller Crimes may instead of Transportation be Order'd a Year's Work on the HighWays others instead of Whippings a proportion'd Time and the like which wou'd by a moderate computation provide us generally  a supply of Workmen and coming in as fast as they go off and let the Overseers alone to make them Work  Secondly By an Agreement with the  Guinea  Company to furnish  Negroes  who are generally Persons that do a great deal of Work and all these are Subsisted very reasonably out of a Publick Storehouse  Thirdly By Carts and Horses to be Bought not Hir'd with a few Able Carters and to the other a few Workmen that have Judgment to Direct the rest and thus I question not the Great Causway shall be done for  s per  Foot Charge but of this by the by  Fourthly A Liberty to ask Charirities and Benevolences to the Work  To the Question How this Money shall be Rais'd I think if the Parliament settle the Tax on the  County for Eight Years at  l per Ann  no Man need ask how it shall be Rais'dIt will be easy enough to Raise the Money and no Parish can grudge to pay a little larger Rate for such a Term on condition never to be Tax'd for the HighWays any more  Eight Years Assessment at  l per Ann  is enough to afford to Borrow the Money by way of Anticipation if need be the Fund being secur'd by Parliament and appropriated to that Use and no other  As to what Security for Performance  The Lands which are Enclos'd may be appropriated by the same Act of Parliament to the Bank and Undertakers upon condition of Performance and to be Forfeit to the use of the several Parishes to which they belong in case upon Presentation by the Grand  Juries and reasonable Time given any part of the Roads in such and such Parishes be not kept and maintain'd in that Posture they are Propos'd to be Now the Lands thus settled are an eternal Security to the Country for the keeping the Roads in Repair because they will always be of so much Value over the needful Charge as will make it worth while to the Undertakers to preserve their Title to them and the Tenure of them being so precarious as to be liable to Forfeiture on Default they will always be careful to uphold the Causways  Lastly What Profit to the Undertakers For we must allow them to Gain and that considerably or no Man wou'd undertake such a Work  To this I propose First  During the Work allow them out of the Stock  l per Ann  for Management  After the Work is finish'd so much of the  l per Ann  as can be sav'd and the Roads kept in good Repair let be their own and if the Lands Secur'd be not of the Value of  l  a Year let so much of the Eight Years Tax be set apart as may Purchase Land to make them up if they come to more let the Benefit be to the Adventurers  It may be Objected here That a Tax of  l  for Eight Years will come in as fast as it can well be laid out and so no Anticipations will be requisite for the whole Work Propos'd cannot be probably finished in less Time and if so     l  The Charge of the Country amounts to    The Lands sav'd Eight Years Revenue         which is  l  more than the  Charge and if the Work be done so much Cheaper as is mentioned the Profit to the Undertaker will be Unreasonable  To this I say I wou'd have the Undertakers bound to accept the Sallary of  l per Ann  for Management and if a whole Years Tax can be spar'd either leave it Unrais'd upon the Country or put it in Bank to be improv'd against any occasion of Building perhaps a great  Bridge  or some very wet Season or Frost may so Damnify the Works as to make them require more than ordinary Repair But the Undertakers shou'd make no private Advantage of such an Overplus there might be ways enough found for it  Another Objection lies against the Possibility of Enclosing the Lands upon the Waste which generally belongs  to some Mannor whose different Tenures may be so cross and so otherwise encumbred that even the Lord of those Mannors though they were willing cou'd not Convey them  This may be Answer'd in General That an Act of Parliament is  Omnipotent  with respect to Titles and Tenures of Land and can Empower Lords and Tenants to Consent to what else they cou'd not as to Particulars they cannot be Answer'd till they are Propos'd but there is no doubt but an Act of Parliament may adjust it all in one Head  What a Kingdom wou'd  England  be if this were perform'd in all the Counties of it and yet I believe it is feasible even in the worst I have narrowly observ'd all the Considerable Ways in that unpassable County of  Sussex  which especially in some parts in the  Wild  as they very properly call  it of the County hardly admits the Countrey People to Travel to Markets in Winter and makes Corn dear at Market because it can't be brought and cheap at the Farmer's House because he can't carry it to Market yet even in that County wou'd I undertake to carry on this Proposal and that to great Advantage if back'd with the Authority of an Act of Parliament  I have seen in that horrible Country the Road to Yards Broad lie from side to side all Poach'd with Cattel the Land of no manner of Benefit and yet no going with a Horse but at every step up to the Shoulders full of Sloughs and Holes and covered with standingwater It costs them incredible Sums of Money to Repair them and the very Places that are mended wou'd fright a young Traveller to go over them The  Romans  Master'd this Work and by a firm Causeway made a Highway quite through this deep Country through  Darkin  in  Surry  to  Stansted  and thence to  Okeley  and so on to  Arundel  its Name tells us what it was made of for it was call'd  Stonestreet  and many visible parts of it remain to this day  Now would any Lord of a Mannor refuse to allow Yards in breadth out of that Road I mention'd to have the other made into a Firm Fair and Pleasant Causeway over that Wilderness of a Countrey  Or would not any man acknowledge That putting this Country into a condition for Carriages and Travellers to pass would be a great Work The Gentlemen would find the Benefit of it in the Rent of their Land and Price of their Timber the Countrey People would find the difference in the  Sale of their Goods which now they cannot carry beyond the first MarketTown and hardly thither and the whole County would reap an Advantage an hundred to one greater than the Charge of it And since the Want we feel of any Convenience is generally the first Motive to Contrivance for a Remedy I wonder no man ever thought of some Expedient for so considerable a Defect  Of ASSURANCES  ASSURANCES among Merchants I believe may plead Prescription and has been of use time out of mind in Trade tho perhaps never so much a Trade as now  'Tis a Compact among Merchants Its beginning being an Accident to  Trade and arose from the  Disease of Mens Tempers  who having run larger Adventures in a single Bottom than afterwards they found convenient grew fearful and uneasy and discovering their uneasiness to others who perhaps had no Effects in the same Vessel they offer to bear part of the Hazard for part of the Profit Convenience made this a Custom and Custom brought it into a Method till at last it becomes a Trade  I cannot question the Lawfulness of it since all Risque in Trade is for Gain and when I am necessitated to have a greater Cargo of Goods in such or such a Bottom than my Stock can afford to lose another may  surely  offer to go a Part with me and as 'tis just if I give another part of the Gain he shou'd run part of the Risque so it is as just that if he runs part of my Risque he shou'd have part  of the Gain Some Object the disparity of the Premio to the Hazard when the Ensurer runs the Risque of  l  on the Seas from  Jamaica  to  London  for  s  which say they is preposterous and unequal Though this Objection is hardly worth Answering to Men of Business yet it looks something fair to them that know no better and for the Information of such I trouble the Reader with a few Heads  First They must consider the Ensurer is out no Stock  Secondly It is but one Risque the Ensurer runs whereas the Assured has had a Risque out a Risque of Debts abroad a Risque of a Market and a Risque of his Factor and has a Risque of a Market to come and therefore ought to have an answerable Profit  Thirdly If it has been a Trading Voyage perhaps the Adventurer has Paid Three or Four such Premio's  which sometimes make the Ensurer clear more by a Voyage than the Merchant I my self have Paid  l  Ensurances in those small Premio's on a Voyage I have not gotten  l  by and I suppose I am not the first that has done so neither  This way of Assuring has also as other Arts of Trade have suffer'd some Improvement if I may be allow'd that Term in our Age and the first step upon it was an  EnsuranceOffice for Houses to Ensure them from Fire  Common Fame gives the Project to Dr  Barebone  a Man I suppose better known as a Builder than a Physician Whether it were his or whose it was I do not enquire it was settled on a Fund of GroundRents to Answer in case of Loss and met with very good Acceptance  But it was soon follow'd by another by way of  Friendly Society  where every  one who Subscribe pay their  Quota  to Build up any Man's House who is a Contributor if it shall happen to be Burnt I won't decide which is the Best or which Succeeded best but I believe the latter brings in most Money to the Contriver  Only one Benefit I cannot omit which they reap from these Two Societies who are not concern'd in either That if any Fire happen whether in Houses Ensur'd or not Ensur'd they have each of them a set of Lusty Fellows generally Watermen who being immediately call'd up whereever they live by Watchmen Appointed are it must be confess'd very Active and Diligent in helping to put out the Fire  As to any further Improvement to be made upon Assurances in Trade no question there may and I doubt  not but on Payment of a small Duty to the Government the King might be made the General Ensurer of all Foreign Trade Of which more under another Head  I am of the opinion also that an Office of Ensurance Erected to Ensure the Titles of Lands in an Age where they are so precarious as now might be a Project not unlikely to succeed if Establish'd on a good Fund But I shall say no more to that because it seems to be a Design in hand by some Persons in Town and is indeed no Thought of my own  Ensuring of Life I cannot admire I shall say nothing to it but that in  Italy  where  Stabbing  and  Poysoning  is so much in Vogue something may be said for it and on contingent Annuities and yet I never knew the thing much approv'd of on any account  Of FRIENDLYSOCIETIES  ANother Branch of Ensurance is by Contribution or to borrow the Term from that beforemention'd  FriendlySocieties  which is in short a Number of People entring into a Mutual Compact to Help one another in case any Disaster or Distress fall upon them  If Mankind cou'd agree as these might be Regulated all things which have Casualty in them might be Secur'd But one thing is Particularly requir'd in this way of Assurances None can be admitted but such whose Circumstances are at least in some degree alike and so Mankind must be  sorted  into Classes and as their Contingences differ every different Sort may be a Society upon even Terms for the Circumstances of People  as to Life differ extremely by the Age and Constitution of their Bodies and difference of Employment as he that lives on shore against him that goes to Sea or a Young Man against an Old Man or a Shopkeeper against a Soldier are unequal I don't pretend to determine the Controverted Point of Predestination the Foreknowledge and Decrees of Providence perhaps if a Man be Decreed to be Kill'd in the Trenches the same Foreknowledge Order'd him to List himself a Soldier that it might come to pass and the like of a Seaman but this I am sure speaking of Second Causes a Seaman or a Soldier is subject to more contingent hazards than other Men and therefore are not upon equal Terms to form such a Society nor is an Annuity on the Life of such a Man worth so much as it is upon other Men therefore if a Society shou'd agree together to Pay the  Executor of every Member so much after the Decease of the said Member the Seamens Executors wou'd most certainly have an Advantage and receive more than they Pay So that 'tis necessary to sort the World into Parcels Seamen with Seamen Soldiers with Soldiers and the like  Nor is this a new thing the  Friendly Society  must not pretend to assume to themselves the Contrivance of the Method or think us guilty of borrowing from them when we draw this into other Branches for I know nothing is taken from them but the bare word  FriendlySociety  which they cannot pretend to be any considerable piece of Invention neither  I can refer them to the very individual Practice in other things which claims prescription beyond the begining of the last Age and that is in our Marshes and Fens in  Essex Kent  and the  Isle of Ely  where great Quantities of Land being with much Pains and a vast Charge recovered out of the Seas and Rivers and maintain'd with Banks which they call Walls the Owners of those Lands agree to Contribute to the keeping up those Walls and keeping out the Sea which is all one with a  FriendlySociety  and if I have a Piece of Land in any Level or Marsh tho' it bounds no where on the Sea or River yet I pay my Proportion to the Maintenance of the said Wall or Bank and if at any time the Sea breaks in the Damage is not laid upon the Man in whose Land the Breach happened unless it was by his neglect but it lies on the whole Land and is called a  LevelLot  Again I have known it practised in Troops of Horse especially when it was so order'd that the Troopers  Mounted themselves where every private Trooper has agreed to Pay perhaps  d per diem  out of his Pay into a Publick Stock which Stock was employed to Remount any of the Troop who by Accident shou'd lose his Horse  Again The Sailors Contribution to the Chest at  Chatham  is another  FriendlySociety  and more might be nam'd  To argue against the Lawfulness of this wou'd be to cry down common Equity as well as Charity for as 'tis kind that my Neighbour shou'd Relieve me if I fall into Distress or Decay so 'tis but Equal he shou'd do so if I agreed to have done the same for him and if God Almighty has Commanded us to Relieve and Help one another in Distress sure it must be commendable to bind our selves by Agreement to Obey that Command  nay it seems to be a Project that we are led to by the Divine Rule and has such a Latitude in it that for ought I know as I said all the Disasters in the World might be prevented by it and Mankind be secur'd from all the Miseries Indigences and Distresses that happen in the World In which I crave leave to be a little Particular  First General Peace might be secur'd all over the World by it if all the Powers agreed to suppress him that Usurp'd or Encroach'd upon his Neighbour All the Contingences of Life might be fenc'd against by this Method as Fire is already as Thieves Floods by Land Storms by Sea Losses of all Sorts and Death it self in a manner by making it up to the Survivor  I shall begin with the Seamen for as their Lives are subject to more hazards  than others they seem to come first in view  Of Seamen  Sailors are  Les Enfans Perdue  the  Forlorn hope of the World  they are Fellows that bid Defiance to Terror and maintain a constant War with the Elements who by the Magick of their Art Trade in the very confines of Death and are always posted within shot as I may say of the Grave 'Tis true their familiarity with Danger makes them despise it for which I hope no body will say they are the wiser and Custom has so harden'd them that we find them the worst of Men tho' always in view of their last Moment  I have observ'd one great Error in the Custom of  England  relating  to these sort of People and which this way of  FriendlySociety  wou'd be a Remedy for  If a Seaman who Enters himself or is Press'd into the King's Service be by any Accident Wounded or Disabled to Recompence him for the Loss he receives a Pension during Life which the Sailors call  SmartMoney  and is proportioned to their Hurt as for the Loss of an Eye Arm Leg or Finger and the like and as 'tis a very Honourable thing so 'tis but reasonable That a Poor Man who Loses his Limbs which are his Estate in the Service of the Government and is thereby disabled from his Labour to get his Bread shou'd be provided for and not suffer'd to Beg or Starve for want of those Limbs he lost in the Service of his Country  But if you come to the Seamen in the Merchants Service not the least Provision is made which has been the Loss of many a good Ship with many a Rich Cargo which wou'd otherwise have been Sav'd  And the Sailors are in the Right of it too  For Instance  A Merchant Ship coming home from the  Indies  perhaps very Rich meets with a Privateer not so Strong but that She might Fight him and perhaps get off the Captain calls up his Crew tells them  Gentlemen You see how 'tis I don't question but we may Clear our selves of this Caper if you will Stand by Me  One of the Crew as willing to Fight as the rest and as far from a Coward as the Captain but endow'd with a little more Wit than his Fellows Replies  Noble Captain We are all willing to Fight and don't question but to Beat him  off but here is the Case If we are Taken we shall be set on Shore and then sent Home and Lose perhaps our Cloaths and a little Pay but if we Fight and Beat the Privateer perhaps Half a Score of us may be Wounded and Lose our Limbs and then we are Undone and our Families if you will Sign an Obligation to us That the Owners or Merchants shall allow a Pension to such as are Maim'd that we may not Fight for the Ship and go a Begging our selves we will bring off the Ship or Sink by her side otherwise I am not willing to Fight for my part  The Captain cannot do this so they Strike and the Ship and Cargo is Lost  If I shou'd turn this suppos'd Example into a real History and Name the Ship and the Captain that did so it wou'd be too plain to be contradicted  Wherefore for the Encouragement of Sailors in the Service of the Merchant I wou'd have a  FriendlySociety  Erected for Seamen wherein all Sailors or Seafaringmen Entring their Names Places of Abode and the Voyages they go upon at an  Office of Ensurance for Seamen  and Paying there a certain small Quarteridge of  s per  Quarter shou'd have a Seal'd Certificate from the Governors of the said Office for the Articles hereafter mentioned  If any such Seaman either in Fight or by any other Accident at Sea come to be disabled he shou'd receive from the said Office the following Sums of Money either in Pension for Life or Ready Money as he pleas'd        l     l     For the Loss of  An Eye    or    Per Ann  for Life  Both Eyes      One Leg      Both Legs      Right Hand      Left Hand      Right Arm      Left Arm      Both Hands      Both Arms      Any Broken Arm or Leg or Thigh towards the Cure    l  If taken by the  Turks    l  towards his Ransom  If he become Infirm and Unable to go to Sea or Maintain himself by Age or Sickness    l per Ann  To their Wives if they are Kill'd or Drown'd    l  In Consideration of this every Seaman Subscribing to the Society shall Agree to Pay to the Receipt of the said Office his  Quota  of the Sum to be Paid whenever and as often as such Claims are made the Claims to be Enter'd into the Office and upon sufficient Proof made the Governors  to Regulate the Division and Publish it in Print  For Example  Suppose Seamen Subscribe to this Society and after Six Months for no Man shou'd Claim sooner than Six Months a Merchant's Ship having Engag'd a Privateer there comes several Claims together As thus     l  A Was Wounded and Lost one Leg    B Blown up with Powder and has Lost an Eye    C Had a Great Shot took off his Arm    D With a Splinter had an Eye struck out         E Was Kill'd with a Great Shot to be paid to his Wife         The Governors hereupon settle the Claim of these Persons and make Publication  That whereas such and such  Seamen Members of the Society have in an Engagement with a  French  Privateer been so and so Hurt their Claims upon the Office by the Rules and Agreements of the said Office being adjusted by the Governors amounts to  l  which being equally divided among the Subscribers comes to  s d  each which all Persons that are Subscribers to the said Office are desired to Pay in for their respective Subscriptions that the said Wounded Persons may be Reliev'd accordingly as they expect to be Reliev'd if the same or the like Casualty shou'd befall them  'Tis but a small matter for a Man to Contribute if he gave  s    d  out of his Wages to Relieve Five Wounded Men of his own Fraternity but at the same time to be assur'd that if he is Hurt or Maim'd he shall have the same Relief it is a thing so rational that hardly any thing but a Harebrain'd  Fellow that thinks of nothing wou'd omit Entring himself into such an Office  I shall not enter further into this Affair because perhaps I may give the Proposal to some Persons who may set it on foot and then the World may see the Benefit of it by the Execution  II For Widows  The same Method of  FriendlySociety  I conceive wou'd be a very proper Proposal for Widows  We have abundance of Women who have been Bred well and Liv'd well Ruin'd in a few Years and perhaps left Young with a House full of Chidren and nothing to Support them which falls generally upon the Wives of the Inferior Clergy or of Shopkeepers and Artificers  They Marry Wives with perhaps  l  to  l  Portion and can settle no Jointure upon them either they are Extravagant and Idle and Waste it or Trade Decays or Losses or a thousand Contingences happen to bring a Tradesman to Poverty and he Breaks the Poor Young Woman it may be has Three or Four Children and is driven to a thousand shifts while he lies in the  Mint  or  Friars  under the  Dilemma  of a Statute of Bankrupt but if he Dies then she is absolutely Undone unless she has Friends to go to  Suppose an Office to be Erected to be call'd  An Office of Ensurance for Widows  upon the following Conditions  Two thousand Women or their Husbands for them Enter their Names into a Register to be kept for that purpose with the Names  Age and Trade of their Husbands with the Place of their Abode Paying at the time of their Entring  s  down with  s    d per  Quarter which is to the setting up and support of an Office with Clerks and all proper Officers for the same  for there is no maintaining such without Charge  they receive every one of them a Certificate Seal'd by the Secretary of the Office and Sign'd by the Governors for the Articles hereafter mentioned  If any one of the Women become a Widow at any time after Six Months from the Date of her Subscription upon due Notice given and Claim made at the Office in form as shall be directed she shall receive within Six Months after such Claim made the Sum of  l  in Money without any Deductions saving some small Fees to the Officers which the Trustees  must settle that they may be known  In Consideration of this every Woman so Subscribing Obliges her self to Pay as often as any Member of the Society becomes a Widow the due Proportion or Share allotted to her to Pay towards the  l  for the said Widow provided her Share does not exceed the Sum of  s  No Seaman or Soldiers Wives to be accepted into such a Proposal as this on the account beforemention'd because the Contingences of their Lives are not equal to others unless they will admit this general Exception supposing they do not Die out of the Kingdom  It might also be an Exception That if the Widow that Claim'd had really  bona fide  left her by her Husband to her own use clear of all Debts and Legacies  l  she  shou'd have no Claim the Intent being to Aid the Poor not add to the Rich But there lies a great many Objections against such an Article As  It may tempt some to Forswear themselves  People will Order their Wills so as to Defraud the Exception  One Exception must be made and that is Either very Unequal Matches as when a Woman of Nineteen Marries an Old Man of Seventy or Women who have Infirm Husbands I mean known and publickly so To remedy which Two things are to be done  The Office must have moving Officers without doors who shall inform themselves of such matters and if any such Circumstances appear the Office shou'd have days time to return their Money and declare their Subscriptions Void  No Woman whose Husband had any visible Distemper shou'd claim under a Year after her Subscription  One grand Objection against this Proposal is How you will oblige People to Pay either their Subscription or their Quarteridge  To this I Answer  By no compulsion  tho' that might be perform'd too but altogether voluntary only with this Argument to move it that if they do not continue their Payments they lose the Benefit of their past Contributions  I know it lies as a fair Objection against such a Project as this That the number of Claims are so uncertain That no Body knows what they engage in when they Subscribe for so many may Die Annually out of Two thousand as may make my Payment or  l per Ann  and if a Woman  happen to Pay that for Twenty Years though she receives the  l  at last she is a great Loser but if she dies before her Husband she has lessened his Estate considerably and brought a great Loss upon him  First  I say to this That I wou'd have such a Proposal as this be so fair and so easy that if any Person who had Subscrib'd found the Payments too high and the Claims fall too often it shou'd be at their liberty at any time upon Notice given to be Released and stand Oblig'd no longer and if so  Volenti non fit injuria  every one knows best what their own Circumstances will bear  In the next Place because Death is a Contingency no Man can directly calculate and all that Subscribe must take the hazard yet that a Prejudice against this Notion may not be built on wrong grounds let's examine a little the  probable hazard and see how many shall die Annually out of Subscribers accounting by the common proportion of Burials to the number of the Living  Sir  William Petty  in his  Political Arithmetick  by a very Ingenious Calculation brings the account of Burials in  London  to be in Annually and proves it by all the proper Rules of proportion'd Computation and I'le take my Scheme from thence  If then One in Forty of all the People in  England  Die that supposes Fifty to Die every Year out of our Two Thousand Subscribers and for a Woman to Contribute  s  to every one wou'd certainly be to Agree to Pay  l    s per Ann  upon her Husband's Life to receive  l  when he Di'd and lose it if she Di'd first and yet this wou'd not be a Hazard beyond reason too great for the Gain  But I shall offer some Reasons to prove this to be impossible in our Case First Sir  William Petty  allows the City of  London  to contain about a Million of People and our Yearly Bill of Mortality never yet amounted to in the most Sickly Years we have had Plague Years excepted sometimes but to which is but One in Fifty Now it is to be consider'd here that Children and Ancient People make up one time with another at least one third of our Bills of Mortality and our  Assurances  lies upon none but the Midling Age of the People which is the only Age wherein Life is any thing steady and if that be allow'd there cannot Die by his Computation above One in Eighty of such People every Year but because I wou'd be sure to leave room for Casualty I'le allow One in Fifty shall Die out of our Number Subscrib'd  Secondly It must be allow'd that our Payments falling due only on the Death of Husbands this One in Fifty must not be reckoned upon the Two thousand for 'tis to be suppos'd at least as many Women shall Die as Men and then there is nothing to Pay so that One in Fifty upon One Thousand is the most that I can suppose shall Claim the Contribution in a Year which is Twenty Claims a Year at  s  each and is  l per Ann  and if a Woman Pays this for Twenty Year and Claims at last she is Gainer enough and no extraordinary Loser if she never Claims at all And I verily believe any Office might Undertake to Demand at all Adventures not above  l per Ann  and secure the Subscriber  l  in case she come to Claim as a Widow  I forbear being more particular on this Thought having occasion to be  larger in other Prints the Experiment being resolv'd upon by some Friends who are pleas'd to think this too useful a Project not to be put in execution and therefore I refer the Reader to the Publick Practice of it  I have nam'd these two Cases as special Experiments of what might be done by Assurances in way of  Friendly Society  and I believe I might without Arrogance affirm That the same Thought might be improv'd into Methods that shou'd prevent the General Misery and Poverty of Mankind and at once secure us against Beggars ParishPoor AlmsHouses and Hospitals and by which not a Creature so Miserable or so Poor but should claim Subsistence as their Due and not ask it of Charity  I cannot believe any Creature so wretchedly base as to Beg of mere  choice but either it must proceed from Want or sordid prodigious Covetousness and thence I affirm There can be no  Beggar  but he ought to be either Reliev'd or Punish'd or both If a man begs for mere Covetousness without Want 'tis a baseness of Soul so extremely sordid as ought to be us'd with the utmost Contempt and punish'd with the Correction due to a Dog If he begs for Want that Want is procur'd by Slothfulness and Idleness or by Accident if the latter he ought to be reliev'd if the former he ought to be punish'd for the Cause but at the same time reliev'd also for no man ought to starve let his Crime be what it will  I shall proceed therefore to a Scheme by which all Mankind be he never so mean so poor so unable shall gain for himself a Just Claim to a comfortable Subsistence whensoever Age or  Casualty shall reduce him to a necessity of making use of it There is a Poverty so far from being Despicable that 'tis Honourable when a man by direct Casualty sudden Providence and without any procuring of his own is reduc'd to want Relief from others as by Fire Shipwreck Loss of Limbs and the like  These are sometimes so apparent that they command the Charity of others but there are also many Families reduc'd to Decay whose Conditions are not so publick and yet their Necessities as great Innumerable Circumstances reduce men to want and pressing Poverty oblige some people to make their Cases publick or starve and from thence came the Custom of Begging which Sloth and Idleness has improv'd into a Trade But the Method I propose thoroughly put in practice would remove the  Cause and the Effect wou'd cease of course  Want of Consideration is the great reason why People do not provide in their Youth and Strength for Old Age and Sickness and the ensuing Proposal is in short only this That all Persons in the time of their Health and Youth while they are able to Work and spare it shou'd lay up some small inconsiderable part of their gettings as a deposit in safe hands to lie as a Store in bank to relieve them if by Age or Accident they come to be disabled or uncapable to Provide for themselves and that if God so Bless them that they nor theirs never come to need it the overplus may be employ'd to relieve such as shall  If an Office in the same nature with this were appointed in every  County in  England  I doubt not but Poverty might easily be prevented and Begging wholly suppres'd  The Proposal is for A PENSIONOFFICE  THAT an Office be erected in some convenient place where shall be a Secretary a Clerk and a Searcher always attending  That all Sorts of People who are Labouring People and of Honest Repute of what Calling or Condition soever Men or Women  Beggars and Soldiers excepted  who being sound of their Limbs and under Fifty Years of Age shall come to the said Office and enter their Names Trades and Places of Abode into a Register to be kept for that purpose and shall  pay down at the time of the said Entring the Sum of Sixpence and from thence One Shilling  per  Quarter shall every one have an Assurance under the Seal of the said Office for these following Conditions  Every such Subscriber if by any Casualty  Drunkenness and Quarrels excepted  they break their Limbs dislocate Joints or are dangerously Maim'd or Bruis'd able Surgeons appointed for that purpose shall take them into their care and endeavour their Cure  Gratis  If they are at any time dangerously Sick on notice given to the said Office able Physicians shall be appointed to Visit them and give their Prescriptions  Gratis  If by Sickness or Accident as aforesaid they lose their Limbs or Eyes so as to be visibly disabled to  Work and are otherwise Poor and unable to provide for themselves they shall either be Cur'd at the Charge of the Office or be allow'd a Pension for Subsistence during Life  If they become Lame Aged Bedrid or by real Infirmity of Body  the Pox excepted  are unable to Work and otherwise uncapable to provide for themselves on proof made that it is really and honestly so they shall be taken into a  Colledge or Hospital  provided for that purpose and be decently maintain'd during life  If they are Seamen and die abroad on board the Merchants Ships they were employ'd in or are cast away and drown'd or taken and die in slavery their Widows shall receive a Pension during their  Widowhood  If they were Tradesmen and paid the Parish Rates if by decay and failure of Trade they Break and  are put in Prison for Debt they shall receive a Pension for Subsistence during  close Imprisonment  If by Sickness or Accidents they are reduc'd to extremities of Poverty for a season on a true representation to the Office they shall be Reliev'd as the Governors shall see cause  It is to be Noted That in the  th  Article such as by Sickness and Age are disabled from Work and Poor shall be taken into the House and provided for whereas in the  d  Article they who are Blind or have lost Limbs  c  shall have Pensions allow'd them  The reason of this difference is this  A Poor Man or Woman that has lost his Hand or Leg or Sight is visibly disabled and we cannot be deceiv'd whereas other Infirmities are not so easily judg'd of and every body  wou'd be claiming a Pension when but few will demand being taken into an Hospital but such as are really in want  And that this might be manag'd with such Care and Candor as a Design which carries so good a face ought to be I Propose the following Method for putting it in Practice  I suppose every Undertaking of such a magnitude must have some principal Agent to push it forward who must manage and direct every thing  always  with direction of the Governors  And First I'le suppose One General Office erected for the great Parishes of  Stepney  and  Whitechappel  and as I'le lay down afterwards some Methods to oblige all People to come in and Subscribe so I may be allow'd to suppose here That all the Inhabitants  of those Two large Parishes the meaner Labouring sort I mean shou'd Enter their Names and that the number of them shou'd be a as I believe they wou'd be at least  First There shou'd be Nam'd of the principal Inhabitants of the said Parishes of which the ChurchWardens for the time being and all the Justices of the Peace dwelling in the bounds of the said Parish and the Ministers resident for the time being to be part to be Governors of the said Office  The said to be first Nominated by the LordMayor of  London  for the time being and every Vacancy to be suppli'd in days at farthest by the Majority of Voices of the rest  The to chuse a Committee of to sit twice a week of whom to  be a  Quorum  with a Chief Governor a DeputyGovernor and a Treasurer  In the Office a Secretary with Clerks of his own a Register and Clerks Searchers a Messenger one in daily attendance under Salary a Physician a Surgeon and Visitors  In the Hospital more or less according to the Number of People entertain'd a Housekeeper a Steward Nurses a Porter and a Chaplain  For the Support of this Office and that the deposite Money might go to none but the Persons and Uses for whom it is paid and that it might not be said Officers and Salaries was the chief end of the Undertaking  as in many a Project it has been  I propose That the Manager or Undertaker who I mention'd before be the Secretary who shall have a Clerk allow'd him whose business it shall be to keep the Register take the Entries  and give out the Tickets Seal'd by the Governors and Sign'd by himself and to Enter always the Payment of Quarteridge of every Subscriber And that there may be no Fraud or Connivance and too great Trust be not repos'd in the said Secretary every Subscriber who brings his Quarteridge is to put it into a great Chest lockt up with Locks every Member of the Committee to keep a Key so that it cannot be open'd but in the Presence of them all and every time a Subscriber pays his Quarteridge the Secretary shall give him a Seal'd Ticket thus  Christmas  which shall be allow'd as the Receipt of Quarteridge for that Quarter  Note The reason why every Subscriber shall take a Receipt or Ticket for his Quarteridge is because this must be the standing Law of the  Office that if any Subscriber fail to pay their Quarteridge they shall never Claim after it until double so much be paid nor not at all that Quarter whatever befalls them  The Secretary shou'd be allow'd to have  d  for every Ticket of Entry he gives out and  d  for every Receipt he gives for Quarteridge to be accounted for as follows  One Third to himself in lieu of Salary he being to Pay Three Clerks out of it  One Third to the Clerks and other Officers among them  And One Third to defray the incident Charge of the Office  Thus Calculated     Per Ann           l  s  d     Subscribers paying  d  each every Quarter is           One Third  To the Secretary  per Ann  and Three Clerks                 l Per Ann           One Third  To a Register          To a Clerk    To Searchers    To a Physician    To a Surgeon    To Four Visitors    One Third To Incident Charges such as  To Ten CommitteeMen  s  each sitting twice  per  Week is          To a Clerk of Committees    To a Messenger    A House for the Office    A House for the Hospital    Contingencies            s    d                          All the Charge being thus paid out of such a Trifle as  d per  Quarter the next Consideration is to examine what the Incomes of this Subscription may be and in time what may be the Demands upon it     l  s  d  If persons subscribe they pay down at their entring each  d  which is        And the first year's Payment is in Stock at  s per  Quarter        It must be allow'd that under Three Months the Subscriptions will not be well compleat so the Payment of Quarteridge shall not begin but from the Day after the Books are full or shut up and from thence one year is to pass before any Claim can be made and the Money coming in at separate times I suppose no Improvement upon it for the first year except of the which lent to the King on some good Fund at  l per Cent  Interest advances the first year        The Quarteridge of the Second year abating for Claims        And the Interest of the first year's Money at the end of the second year lent to the King as aforesaid at  per Cent  Interest is        The Quarteridge of the Third year abating for Claims        The Interest of former Cash to the end of the Third Year        Income of Three Years        Note  Any person may pay  s  up to  s  Quarterly if they please and upon a Claim will be allow'd in proportion  To assign what shall be the Charge upon this where Contingency has so great a share is not to be done but by way of Political Arithmetick a probable Guess may be made  'Tis to be noted That the Pensions I propose to be paid to Persons claiming by the Third Fifth and Sixth Articles are thus Every Person who paid  s  Quarterly shall receive  d  Weekly and so in proportion every  d  paid Quarterly by any one Person to receive so many Shillings Weekly if they come to claim a Pension  The first Year no Claim is allow'd so the Bank has in Stock compleatly  l  From thence we are to consider the Number of Claims  Sir  William Petty  in his Political Arithmetick supposes not above one  in to dye  per Ann  out of the whole number of people and I can by no means allow that the Circumstances of our Claims will be as frequent as Death for these Reasons  Our Subscriptions respect all persons grown and in the Prime of their Age past the first and providing against the last part of Danger Sir  William  's Account including Children and Old People which always makes up One Third of the Bills of Mortality  Our Claims will fall thin at first for several Years and let but the Money increase for Ten Years as it does in the Account for Three Years 'twould be almost sufficient to maintain the whole Number  Allow that Casualty and Poverty are our Debtorside Health Prosperity and Death are the Creditorside of the Account and in all  probable Accounts those Three Articles will carry off Three Fourth Parts of the Number as follows If in shall dye Annually as no doubt they shall and more that is a year which in Years is of the Number I hope I may be allow'd One Third to be out of condition to claim apparently living wihtout the help of Charity and One Third in Health of Body and able to work which put together makes so it leaves to make Claims of Charity and Pensions in the first years and One half of them must according to Sir  William Petty  Die on our hands in years so there remains but  But to put it out of doubt beyond the proportion to be guess'd at I'le allow they shall fall thus  The First Year we are to note none can claim and the Second Year the  Number must be very few but increasing wherefore I suppose     l  One in every shall claim the second year which is The Charge whereof is    One in every the third year is the Charge    Together with the former         To carry on the Calculation     l  s  d  We find the Stock at the end of the  d  year        The Quarteridge of the  th  year abating as before        Interest of the Stock        The Quarteridge of the  th  year        Interest of the Stock                    l  s  d  The Charge        to fall the  th  Year        And the Old continued        the  th  Year        The Old continued                 By this computation the Stock is increased above the Charge in Five years  l    s    d  and yet here are sundry Articles to be considered on both sides of the Account that will necessarily increase the Stock and diminish the Charge     l  s  d  First In the Five years time having claim'd Charity the Number being abated for in the reckoning above for Stock it may be allow'd New Subscriptions will be taken in to keep the Number full which in Five years amounts to        Their Sixpences is                 Which added to  l    s    d  Augments the Stock to           l  s  d  Six thousand two hundred persons claiming help which falls to be sure on the Aged and Infirm I think at a modest computation in Five years time of them may be dead which without allowing annually we take at an Abatement of  l  out of the Charge        Which reduces the Charge to        Besides this the Interest of the Quarteridge which is supposed in the former Account to lie dead till the Year is out which cast up from  Quarter to Quarter allowing it to be put out Quarterly as it may well be amounts to by computation for Five Year  l  From the  th  year as near as can be computed the Number of Pensioners being so great I make no doubt but they shall Die off of the hands of the Undertaker as fast as they shall fall in excepting so much difference as the Payment of every Year which the Interest of the Stock shall supply  For Example     l  s  d  At the end of the Fifth Year the Stock in hand        The Payment of the Sixth Year        Interest of the Stock                    l  s  d  Allow an overplus Charge for keeping in the House which will be dearer than Pensions  l per Ann        Charge of the  th  Year        Balance in Cash                 This also is to be allow'd That all those Persons who are kept by the Office in the House shall have Employment provided for them whereby no Persons shall be kept Idle the Works to be suited to every one's Capacity without Rigour only some distinction to those who are most willing to  Work the Profits of the said Work to the Stock of the House  Besides this there may great and very profitable Methods be found out to improve the Stock beyond the setled Interest of  per Cent  which perhaps may not always be to be had for the  Exchequer  is not always borrowing Money but a Bank of  l  employ'd by faithful hands need not want opportunities of great and very considerable Improvement  Also it wou'd be a very good Object for Persons who Die Rich to  leave Legacies to  which in time might be very well suppos'd to raise a standing Revenue to it  I won't say but various Contingencies may alter the Charge of this Undertaking and swell the Claims beyond proportion further than I extend it but all that and much more is sufficiently answer'd in the Calculations  by above  l  in Stock to Provide for it  As to the Calculation being made on a vast Number of Subscribers and more than perhaps will be allow'd likely to Subscribe I think the proportion may hold good in a few as well as in a great many and perhaps if Subscrib'd it might be as effectual I am indeed willing to think all Men shou'd have sense enough to see the usefulness of such a Design and be perswaded by their Interest to engage in it but some Men have less Prudence than Brutes and will make no provision against Age till it comes and to deal with such Two ways might be us'd by Authority to Compel them  The ChurchWardens and Justices of Peace shou'd send the Beadle of the Parish with an Officer belonging to this Office about to the  Poorer Parishioners to tell them That since such Honourable Provision is made for them to secure themselves in Old Age from Poverty and Distress they shou'd expect no Relief from the Parish if they refus'd to Enter themselves and by sparing so small a part of their Earnings to prevent future Misery  The ChurchWardens of every Parish might refuse the removal of Persons and Families into their Parish but upon their having Entred into this Office  All Persons shou'd be publickly desir'd to forbear giving any thing to Beggars and all common Beggars suppress'd after a certain time for this wou'd effectually suppress Beggery at last  And to oblige the Parishes to do this on behalf of such a Project the Governor of the House shou'd secure  the Parish against all Charges coming upon them from any Person who did Subscribe and pay the Quarteridge and that wou'd most certainly oblige any Parish to endeavour that all the Labouring Meaner People in the Parish shou'd enter their Names for in time 'twou'd most certainly take all the Poor in the Parish off of their hands  I know that by Law no Parish can refuse to Relieve any Person or Family fallen into Distress and therefore to send them word they must expect no Relief wou'd seem a vain threatning but thus far the Parish may do they shall be esteem'd as Persons who deserve no Relief and shall be us'd accordingly For who indeed wou'd ever pity that Man in his Distress who at the expence of  Two Pots of Beer a Month  might have prevented it and wou'd not spare it  As to my Calculations on which I  do not depend neither I say this if they are probable and that in Five years time a Subscription of a Hundred thousand Persons wou'd have  l    s    d  in Cash all Charges paid I desire any one but to reflect what will not such a Sum do  for instance  were it laid out in the Million Lottery Tickets which are now Sold at  l  each and bring in  l per Ann  for Fifteen Years every  l  so laid out pays back in time  l  and that time wou'd be as fast as it wou'd be wanted and therefore be as good as Money or if laid out in improving Rents as GroundRents with Buildings to devolve in time there is no question but a Revenue wou'd be rais'd in time to Maintain One third part of the Number of Subscribers if they shou'd come to Claim Charity  And I desire any Man to consider  the present State of this Kingdom and tell me if all the People of  England  Old and Young Rich and Poor were to Pay into one common Bank  s per Ann  a Head and that  s  duly and honestly manag'd Whether the overplus paid by those who Die off and by those who never come to Want wou'd not in all probability Maintain all that shou'd be Poor and for ever Banish Beggery and Poverty out of the Kingdom  Of WAGERING  WAGERING as now practis'd by Polities and Contracts is become a Branch of  Assurances  it was before more properly a part of Gaming and as it deserv'd had but a very low esteem but  shifting sides and the War providing proper subjects as the contingences of Sieges Battles Treaties and Campaigns it encreas'd to an extraordinary Reputation and Offices were erected on purpose which manag'd it to a strange degree and with great Advantage especially to the Officekeepers so that as has been computed there was not less Gaged on one side and other upon the second Siege of  Limerick  than Two hundred thousand Pound  How 'tis manag'd and by what trick and artifice it became a Trade and how insensibly Men were drawn into it an easy Account may be given  I believe  Novelty  was the first wheel that set it on work and I need make no reflection upon the power of that Charm It was wholly a new thing at least upon the  Exchange  of  London  and the first occasion that gave  it a room among publick Discourse was some Persons forming Wagers on the Return and Success of King  James  for which the Government took occasion to use them as they deserv'd  I  have  heard a Bookseller in King  James  's time say  That if he wou'd have a Book sell he wou'd have it Burnt by the hand of the Common Hangman  the Man no doubt valu'd his Profit above his Reputation but People are so addicted to prosecute a thing that seems forbid that this very practice seem'd to be encourag'd by its being  Contraband  The Trade encreas'd and first on the  Exchange  and then in Coffeehouses it got life till the Brokers  those Vermin of Trade  got hold of it and then particular Offices were set apart for it and an incredible resort thither was to be seen every day  These Offices had not been long in  being but they were throng'd with  Sharpers  and  Setters  as much as the GroomPorter's or any GamingOrdinary in Town where a Man had nothing to do but to make a good Figure and prepare the Keeper of the Office to give him a Credit as a good Man and though he had not a Groat to pay he shou'd take Guineas and sign Polities till he had receiv'd perhaps or  l  in Money on condition to pay great Odds and then Success tries the Man if he Wins his Fortune is made if not he's a better Man than he was before by just so much Money for as to the Debt he is your Humble Servant in the  Temple  or  Whitehall  But besides those who are but the Thieves of the Trade there is a Method as effectual to get Money as possible manag'd with more appearing Honesty but no less Art by which  the Wagerer in Confederacy with the Officekeeper shall lay vast Sums great Odds and yet be always sure to Win  For Example  A Town in  Flanders  or elsewhere during the War is besieg'd perhaps at the beginning of the Siege the Defence is vigorous and Relief probable and it is the opinion of most people the Town will hold out  so long  or perhaps not be taken at all The Wagerer has two or three more of his fort in conjunction of which always the Officekeeper is one and they run down all discourse of the taking the Town and offer great Odds it shall not be taken by such a day Perhaps this goes on a Week and then the Scale turns and tho' they seem to hold the same opinion still yet underhand the Officekeeper has Orders to Take all the Odds which by their Example  was before given against the taking the Town and so all their firstgiven Odds are easily secur'd and yet the people brought into a vein of Betting against the Siege of the Town too Then they order all the Odds to be Taken as long as they will run while they themselves openly give Odds and sign Polities  and oftentimes take their own Money  till they have receiv'd perhaps double what they at first laid Then they turn the Scale at once and cry down the Town and lay that it shall be taken till the length of the first Odds is fully run and by this Manage if the Town be taken they win perhaps Two or Three Thousand Pounds and if it be not taken they are no Losers neither  'Tis visible by experience not one Town in ten is besieg'd but 'tis taken The Art of War is so improv'd and our Generals are so wary that an Army  seldom attempts a Siege but when they are almost sure to go on with it and no Town can hold out if a Relief cannot be had from abroad  Now if I can by first laying  l  to  l  with  A  that the Town shall not be taken wheedle in  B  to lay me  l  to  l  of the same and after that by bringing down the Vogue of the Siege reduce the Wagers to Evenhand and lay  l  with  C  that the Town shall not be taken by this Method 'tis plain  If the Town be not Taken I win  l  and lose  l  If the Town be Taken I win  l  and lose  l  This is Gaming by Rule and in such a Knot 'tis impossible to lose for if it is in any Man's or Company of Men's power by any Artifice to alter  the Odds 'tis in their power to command the Money out of every man's Pocket who has no more Wit than to venture  Of FOOLS  OF all Persons who are Objects of our Charity none move my Compassion like those whom it has pleas'd God to leave in a full state of Health and Strength but depriv'd of Reason to act for themselves And it is in my opinion one of the greatest Scandals upon the  Understanding  of others to mock at those who want  it  Upon this account I think the Hospital we call  Bedlam  to be a Noble Foundation a visible Instance of the sense our Ancestors had of the greatest Unhappiness which can befal Human  Kind Since as the Soul in Man distinguishes him from a Brute so where the Soul is dead for so it is as to acting  no Brute so much a Beast as a Man  But since  never to have  it and to have  lost  it are synonimous in the Effect I wonder how it came to pass that in the Settlement of that Hospital they made no Provision for Persons born without the use of their Reason such as we call  Fools  or more properly  Naturals  We use such in  England  with the last Contempt which I think is a strange Error since tho' they are useless to the Commonwealth they are only so by God's direct Providence and no previous Fault  I think 'twould very well become this Wise Age to take care of such And perhaps they are a particular RentCharge on the  Great Family of Mankind  left by the Maker of us all  like a Younger Brother who tho' the Estate be given from him yet his Father expected the Heir should take some care of him  If I were to be ask'd Who ought in particular to be charg'd with this Work I would answer in general Those who have a Portion of Understanding extraordinary Not that I would lay a Tax upon any man's Brains  or discourage Wit by appointing Wise Men to maintain Fools  But some Tribute is due to God's Goodness for bestowing extraordinary Gifts and who can it be better paid to than such as suffer for want of the same Bounty  For the providing therefore some Subsistence for such that Natural Defects may not be expos'd  It is Propos'd  That a  FoolHouse  be Erected either by Publick Authority or by the City or by an Act of Parliament into which all that are  Naturals  or born Fools without Respect or Distinction should be admitted and maintain'd  For the Maintenance of this a small stated Contribution settl'd by the Authority of an Act of Parliament without any Damage to the Persons paying the same might be very easily rais'd by a Tax upon Learning to be paid by the Authors of Books  Every Book that shall be Printed in  Folio  from sheets and upwards to pay at the Licensing for the whole Impression    l  Under sheets    s  Every  Quarto    s  Every  Octavo  of sheets and upward    s  Every  Octavo  under sheets and every Bound Book in  s      s  Every stitch'd Pamphlet Reprinted Copies the same Rates    s  This Tax to be paid into the Chamber of  London  for the space of Twenty Years would without question raise a Fund sufficient to Build and Purchase a Settlement for this House  I suppose this little Tax being to be rais'd at so few places as the PrintingPresses or the Licensers of Books and consequently the Charge but very small in gathering might bring in about  l per Annum  for the term of Twenty Years which would perform the Work to the degree following  The House should be Plain and Decent for I don't think the Ostentation  of Buildings necessary or suitable to Works of Charity and be built somewhere out of Town for the sake of the Air  The Building to cost about  l  or if the Revenue exceed to cost  l  at most and the Salaries mean in proportion  In the House  A Steward    l per Ann  A Purveyor    A Cook    A Butler    Six Women to assist the Cook and clean the House  l  each    Six Nurses to Tend the People  l  each    A Chaplain         A Hundred AlmsPeople at  l per Ann  Dyet  c         l per Ann  The Table for the Officers and Contingences and Cloaths for the AlmsPeople and Firing put together    l per Ann  An Auditor of the Accounts a Committee of the Governors and Two Clerks     Here I suppose Pounds  per Ann  Revenue to be settl'd upon the House which 'tis very probable might be rais'd from the Tax aforesaid But since an Act of Parliament is necessary to be had for the Collecting this Duty  and that Taxes for keeping of Fools would be difficultly obtain'd while they are so much wanted for Wise Men  I would propose to raise the Money by voluntary Charity which wou'd be a Work would leave more Honour to the Undertakers than Feasts and great Shows which our Publick Bodies too much diminish their Stocks with  But to pass all suppositious ways which are easily thought of but hardly procur'd I propose to maintain Fools out of our own Folly And whereas a great deal of Money has been thrown about in Lotteries the following Proposal would very easily perfect our Work  A CharityLottery  That a Lottery be set up by the Authority of the LordMayor and Court of Aldermen for a Hundred thousand Tickets at Twenty Shillings each to be drawn by the known Way and Method of drawing Lotteries as the MillionLottery was drawn in which no Allowance to be made to any body but the Fortunate to receive the full Sum of One hundred thousand Pounds put in without Discount and yet this double Advantage to follow  That an immediate Sum of One hundred thousand Pounds shall be rais'd and paid into the  Exchequer  for the Publick Use  A Sum of above Twenty thousand Pounds be gain'd to be put into the hands of known Trustees to  be laid out in a Charity for the Maintenance of the Poor  That as soon as the Money shall be come in it shall be paid into the  Exchequer  either on some good Fund if any suitable or on the Credit of  Exchequer  and that when the Lottery is drawn the Fortunate to receive Tallies or Bills from the  Exchequer  for their Money payable at Four Years  The  Exchequer  receives this Money and gives out Tallies according to the Prizes when 'tis drawn all payable at Four Years and the Interest of this Money for Four Years is struck in Tallies proportion'd to the time and given to the Trustees which is the Profit I propose for the Work  Thus the Fortunate have an immediate Title to their Prizes at Four Years without Interest and the Hospital will have also an immediate Title to  l per Ann  for Four  Years which is the Interest at  per Cent per Ann  If any should object against the Time of staying for their Prizes it should be answer'd thus That whoever did not like to stay the Time for the Money upon discounting Four Years Interest at  per Cent  should have their Money down  I think this Specimen will inform any body what might be done by Lotteries were they not hackney'd about in Private Hands who by Fraud and Ill Management put them out of Repute and so neither gain themselves nor suffer any useful handsome Design to succeed  'Twould be needless I suppose to mention That such a Proposal as this ought to be set on foot by Publick Approbation and by Men of known Integrity and Estates that there may be no room left for a suspicion of private advantage  If this or any equivalent Proposal succeeded to raise the Money I would have the House establish'd as aforesaid with larger or smaller Revenues as necessity oblig'd then the Persons to be receiv'd should be without distinction or respect but principally such as were really Poor and Friendless and any that were kept already by any ParishCollection the said Parish should allow Forty Shillings Yearly towards their Maintenance which no Parish would refuse that subsisted them wholly before  I make no question but that if such an Hospital was erected within a Mile or two of the City one great Circumstance would happen  viz  That the common sort of people who are very much addicted to rambling in the Fields would make this House the customary Walk to divert themselves with the Objects to be seen there and  to make what they call Sport with the Calamity of others as is now shamefully allow'd in  Bedlam  To prevent this and that the condition of such which deserves Pity not Contempt might not be the more expos'd by this Charity it should be order'd That the Steward of the House be in Commission of the Peace within the Precincts of the House only and authoriz'd to punish by limited Fines or otherwise any person that shall offer any Abuse to the poor Almspeople or shall offer to make Sport at their Condition  If any person at Reading of this shou'd be so impertinent as to ask To what purpose I wou'd appoint a Chaplain in an Hospital of  Fools  I could answer him very well by saying For the use of the other Persons Officers and Attendants in the House  But besides that Pray  Why not a Chaplain for Fools as well as for Knaves  since both tho' in a different manner are uncapable of reaping any benefit by Religion unless by some invisible Influence they are made docible and since the same Secret Power can restore these to their Reason as must make the other Sensible Pray Why not a Chaplain Ideots indeed were denied the Communion in the Primitive Churches but I never read they were not to be pray'd for or were not admitted to hear  If we allow any Religion and a Divine Supreme Power whose Influence works invisibly on the hearts of men  as he must be worse than the people we talk of who denies it  we must allow at the same time  that Power  can restore the ReasoningFaculty to an Ideot and 'tis our part to use the proper means of supplicating  Heaven to that end leaving the disposingpart to the Issue of unalterable Providence  The Wisdom of Providence has not left us without Examples of some of the most stupid Natural Ideots in the world who have been restor'd to their Reason or as one would think had Reason infus'd after a long Life of  Ideotism  Perhaps among other wise ends to confute that sordid Supposition That Ideots have no Souls  Of BANKRUPTS  THis Chapter has some Right to stand next to that of Fools for besides the common acceptation of late which makes  every Unfortunate Man a Fool  I think no man so much made a Fool of as a  Bankrupt  If I may be allow'd so much liberty with our Laws which are generally good and above all things are temper'd with Mercy Lenity and Freedom This has something in it of Barbarity it gives a loose to the Malice and Revenge of the Creditor as well as a Power to right himself while it leaves the Debtor no way to show himself honest It contrives all the ways possible to drive the Debtor to despair and encourages no new Industry for it makes him perfectly uncapable of any thing but  starving  This Law especially as it is now frequently executed tends wholly to the Destruction of the Debtor and yet very little to the Advantage of the Creditor  The Severities to the Debtor are unreasonable and if I may so say a little inhuman for it not only strips him of all in a moment but  renders him for ever incapable of helping himself or relieving his Family by future Industry If he 'scapes from Prison which is hardly done too if he has nothing left he must starve or live on Charity if he goes to work no man dare pay him his Wages but he shall pay it again to the Creditors if he has any private Stock left for a Subsistence he can put it no where every man is bound to be a Thief and take it from him If he trusts it in the hands of a Friend he must receive it again as a great Courtesy for that Friend is liable to account for it I have known a poor man prosecuted by a Statute to that degree that all he had left was a little Money which he knew not where to hide at last that he might not starve he gives it to his Brother who had entertain'd him the Brother after he had his Money quarrels with him to get him out of  his House and when he desires him to let him have the Money lent him gives him this for Answer  I cannot pay you safely for there is a Statute against you  which run the poor man to such Extremities that he destroy'd himself Nothing is more frequent than for men who are reduc'd by Miscarriage in Trade to Compound and Set up again and get good Estates but a  Statute  as we call it for ever shuts up all doors to the Debtor's Recovery as if Breaking were a Crime so Capital that he ought to be cast out of Human Society and expos'd to Extremities worse than Death And which will further expose the fruitless Severity of this Law 'tis easy to make it appear That all this Cruelty to the Debtor is so far generally speaking from advantaging the Creditors that it destroys the Estate consumes it in extravagant Charges and unless the  Debtor be consenting seldom makes any considerable Dividends And I am bold to say There is no Advantage made by the prosecuting of a Statute with Severity but what might be doubly made by Methods more merciful And tho' I am not to prescribe to the Legislators of the Nation yet by way of Essay I take leave to give my Opinion and my Experience in the Methods Consequences and Remedies of this Law  All people know who remember any thing of the Times when that Law was made that the Evil it was pointed at was grown very rank and Breaking to defraud Creditors so much a Trade that the Parliament had good reason to set up a Fury to deal with it and I am far from reflecting on the Makers of that Law who no question saw 'twas necessary at that time But as Laws tho' in themselves good  are more or less so as they are more or less seasonable squar'd and adapted to the Circumstances and Time of the Evil they are made against so 'twere worth while with Submission for the same Authority to examine  Whether the Length of Time since that Act was made has not given opportunity to Debtors  To evade the Force of the Act by Ways and Shifts to avoid the Power of it and secure their Estates out of the reach of it  To turn the Point of it against those whom it was made to relieve Since we see frequently now that Bankrupts desire Statutes and procure them to be taken out against themselves  Whether the Extremities of this Law are not often carried on beyond the true Intent and Meaning of the Act it self by Persons who besides  being Creditors are also Malicious and gratify their private Revenge by prosecuting the Offender to the Ruin of his Family  If these Two Points are to be prov'd then I am sure 'twill follow That this Act is now a Publick Grievance to the Nation and I doubt not but will be one time or other repeal'd by the same Wise Authority which made it  Time and Experience has furnish'd the Debtors with Ways and Means to evade the Force of this Statute and to secure their Estate against the reach of it which renders it often insignificant and consequently the Knave against whom the Law was particularly bent gets off while he only who fails of mere Necessity and whose honest Principle will not permit him to practice those Methods is expos'd to the Fury of this Act And as things are now order'd nothing is  more easy than for a man to order his Estate so that a Statute shall have no power over it or at least but a little  If the Bankrupt be a Merchant no Statute can reach his Effects beyond the Seas so that he has nothing to secure but his Books and away he goes into the  Friars  If a Shopkeeper he has more difficulty but that is made easy for there are Men and Carts to be had  whose Trade it is  and who in One Night shall remove the greatest Warehouse of Goods or Cellar of Wines in the Town and carry them off into those Nurseries of Rogues the  Mint  and  Friars  and our Constables and Watch who are the allow'dMagistrates of the Night and who shall stop a poor little lurking Thief that it may be has stole a bundle of old Cloaths worth  s  shall let them all pass without any disturbance and  fee a hundred honest men robb'd of their Estates before their faces to the Eternal Infamy of the Justice of the Nation  And were a man but to hear the Discourse among the Inhabitants of those Dens of Thieves when they first swarm about a New Comer to comfort him for they are not all harden'd to a like degree at onceWell says the first  Come don't be concern'd you have got a good Parcel of Goods away I promise you you need not value all the World Ah wou'd I had done so  says another  I'de a laugh'd at all my Creditors Ay  says the young Proficient in the harden'd Trade  but my Creditors Damn the Creditors  says a Third  Why there's such a one and such a one they have Creditors too and they won't agree with them and here they live like Gentlemen and care not a farthing for them Offer your Creditors Half a  Crown in the Pound and pay it them in Old Debts and if they won't take it let them alone they'll come after you never fear it O But a Statute  says he again  O But the Devil  cries the Minter  Why 'tis the Statutes we live by  say they  Why if 'twere not for Statutes Creditors would comply and Debtors wou'd compound and We Honest Fellows here of the Mint wou'd be starv'd Prithee What need you care for a Statute A Thousand Statutes can't reach you here  This is the  Language of the Countrey  and the New Comer soon learns to speak it for I think I may say without wronging any man I have known many a man go in among them Honest that is without Ill Design but I never knew one come away so againThen comes a Graver Sort among this Black Crew for here as in Hell are Fiends of Degrees and different Magnitude  and he falls into Discourse with the New Comer and gives him more solid Advice  Look you Sir I am concern'd to see you melancholly I am in your Circumstance too and if you'll accept of it I'le give you the best Advice I can  and so begins the Grave Discourse  The man is in too much trouble not to want Counsel so he thanks him and he goes on  Send a Summons to your Creditors and offer them what you can propose in the Pound  always reserving a good Stock to begin the World again  which if they will take you are a Freeman and better than you were before if they won't take it you know the worst of it you are on the better side of the hedge with them If they will not take it but will proceed to a Statute you have nothing to do but to oppose Force with Force for the Laws of Nature tell you you must not starve and a Statute is so  barbarous so unjust so malicious a way of proceeding against a man that I do not think any Debtor oblig'd to consider any thing but his own Preservation when once they go on with thatFor why  says the old studi'd Wretch  should the Creditors spend your Estate in the Commission and then demand the Debt of you too Do you owe any thing to the Commission of the Statute  No says he  Why then  says he  I warrant their Charges will come to  l  out of your Estate and they must have  s  a day for starving you and your Family I cannot see why any man should think I am bound in Conscience to pay the Extravagance of other men If my Creditors spend  l  in getting in my Estate by a Statute which I offer'd to surrender without it I'le reckon that  l  paid them let them take it among them for Equity is due to a Bankrupt as well as to any man and if the Laws do not give it us we must take it  This is too rational Discourse not to please him and he proceeds by this Advice the Creditors cannot agree but take out a Statute and the man that offer'd at first it may be  s  in the Pound is kept in that cursed place till he has spent it all and can offer nothing and then gets away beyond Sea or after a long Consumption gets off by an Act of Relief to poor Debtors and all the Charges of the Statute falls among the Creditors Thus I knew a Statute taken out against a Shopkeeper in the Countrey and a considerable Parcel of Goods too seiz'd and yet the Creditors what with Charges and two or three Suits at Law lost their whole Debts and  s per  Pound ContributionMoney for Charges and the poor Debtor like a man under the Surgeon's hand died in the Operation  Another Evil that Time and Experience has brought to light from this Act is when the Debtor himself shall confederate with some particular Creditor to take out a Statute and this is a Masterpiece of  Plot  and Intriegue For perhaps some Creditor honestly receiv'd in the way of Trade a large Sum of Money of the Debtor for Goods sold him when he was  sui juris  and he by consent shall own himself a Bankrupt before that time and the Statute shall reach back to bring in an Honest Man's Estate to help pay a Rogue's Debt Or a man shall go and borrow a Sum of Money upon a Parcel of Goods and lay them to Pledge he keeps the Money and the Statute shall fetch away the Goods to help forward the Composition These are Tricks I can give too good an account of having more than once suffer'd by the Experiment I could  give a Scheme of more ways but I think 'tis needless to prove the Necessity of laying aside that Law which is pernicious to both Debtor and Creditor and chiefly hurtful to the Honest Man who it was made to preserve  The next Enquiry is Whether the Extremities of this Law are not often carried on beyond the true Intent and Meaning of the Act it self for Malicious and Private Ends to gratify Passion and Revenge  I remember the Answer a Person gave me who had taken out Statutes against several Persons and some his near Relations who had fail'd in his Debt and when I was one time dissuading him from prosecuting a man who ow'd me Money as well as him I us'd this Argument with him  You know the man has nothing left to pay That's true  says he  I know that well enough To what purpose then  said I  will you prosecute him Why Revenge is sweet  said heNow a man that will prosecute a Debtor not as a Debtor but by way of Revenge such a man is I think not intentionally within the benefit of our Law  In order to state the Case right there are four Sorts of People to be consider'd in this Discourse and the true Case is how to distinguish them  There is the Honest Debtor who fails by visible Necessity Losses Sickness Decay of Trade or the like  The Knavish Designing or Idle Extravagant Debtor who fails because either he has run out his Estate in Excesses or on purpose to cheat and abuse his Creditors  There is the moderate Creditor who seeks but his own but will omit no lawful Means to gain  it and yet will hear reasonable and just Arguments and Proposals  There is the Rigorous Severe Creditor that values not whether the Debtor be Honest Man or Knave Able or Unable but will have his Debt  whether it be to be had or no  without Mercy without Compassion full of Ill Language Passion and Revenge  How to make a Law to suit to all these is the Case  That a necessary Favour might be shown to the first  in Pity and Compassion to the Unfortunate in Commiseration of Casualty and Poverty which no man is exempt from the danger of  That a due Rigor and Restraint be laid upon the second  that Villany and Knavery might not be encourag'd by a Law  That a due Care be taken of the third  that mens Estates may as far as can  be secur'd to them  And due Limits set to the last  that no man may have an unlimited Power over his FellowSubjects to the Ruin of both Life and Estate  All which I humbly conceive might be brought to pass by the following Method to which I give the Title of  A Court of Enquiries  This Court should consist of a select Number of Persons to be chosen Yearly out of the several Wards of the City by the LordMayor and Court of Aldermen and out of the several Inns of Court by the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper for the time being and to consist of  To be chosen by the rest and nam'd every year also  A President  A Secretary  A Treasurer  A Judge of Causes for the Proof of Debts  Fifty two Citizens out of every Ward two of which number to be Twelve Merchants  Two Lawyers Baristers at least out of each of the Inns of Court  That a Commission of Enquiry into Bankrupts Estates be given to these confirm'd and settl'd by Act of Parliament with Power to Hear Try and Determine Causes as to Proof of Debts and Disputes in Accounts between Debtor and Creditor without Appeal  The Office for this Court to be at  Guildhall  where Clerks shou'd be always attending and a  Quorum  of the Commissioners to sit  de Die in Diem  from Three to Six a Clock in the Afternoon  To this Court every man who finds himself press'd by his Affairs so that he cannot carry on his Business shall apply himself as follows  He shall go to the Secretary's Office and give in his Name with this short Petition  To the Honourable the President and Commissioners of His Majesty's Court of Enquiries The humble Petition of  A B  of the Parish of in the Haberdasher  Sheweth  THat your Petitioner being unable to carry on his Business by reason of great Losses and Decay of Trade and being ready and willing to make a full and entire Discovery of his whole Estate and to deliver up the same to your Honours upon Oath as the Law directs for the satisfaction  of his Creditors and having to that purpose entred his Name into the Books of your Office on the  of this Instant  Your Petitioner humbly prays the Protection of this Honourable Court  And shall ever Pray  c  The Secretary is to lay this Petition before the Commissioners who shall sign it of course and the Petitioner shall have an Officer sent home with him immediately who shall take Possession of his House and Goods and an exact Inventory of every thing therein shall be taken at his Entrance by other Officers also appointed by the Court according to which Inventory the first Officer and the Bankrupt also shall be accountable  This Officer shall supersede even the Sheriff in Possession excepting  by an Extent for the King only with this Provision  That if the Sheriff be in Possession by Warrant on Judgment obtain'd by due Course of Law and without Fraud or Deceit and  bona fide  in Possession before the Debtor entred his Name in the Office in such case the Plaintiff to have a double Dividend allotted to his Debt for it was the fault of the Debtor to let Execution come upon his Goods before he sought for Protection but this not to be allow'd upon Judgment confess'd  If the Sheriff be in Possession by  fieri facias  for Debt immediately due to the King the Officer however shall quit his Possession to the Commissioners and they shall see the King's Debt fully satisfied before any Division be made to the Creditors  The Officers in this case to take no Fee from the Bankrupt nor to use any  indecent or uncivil Behaviour to the Family which is a most notorious Abuse now permitted to the Sheriffs Officers whose Fees I have known on small Executions  on pretence of Civility  amount to as much as the Debt and yet behave themselves with unsufferable Insolence all the while  This Officer being in Possession the Goods may be remov'd or not remov'd the Shop shut up or not shut up as the Bankrupt upon his Reasons given to the Commissioners may desire  The Inventory being taken the Bankrupt shall have Fourteen Days time and more if desir'd upon showing good Reasons to the Commissioners to settle his Books and draw up his Accounts and then shall deliver up all his Books together with a full and true Account of his whole Estate  Real and Personal to which Account he shall make Oath and afterwards to any particular of it if the Commissioners require  After this Account given in the Commissioners shall have Power to examine upon Oath all his Servants or any other Person and if it appears that he has conceal'd any thing in breach of his Oath to Punish him as is hereafter specified  Upon a fair and just Surrender of all his Estate and Effects  bona fide  according to the true Intent and Meaning of the Act the Commissioners shall return to him in Money or such of his Goods as he shall chuse at a value by a just Appraisement  l per Cent  of all the Estate he surrender'd to him together with a full and free Discharge from all his Creditors  The Remainder of the Estate of the Debtor to be fairry and equally divided  among the Creditors who are to apply themselves to the Commissioners The Commissioners to make a necessary Enquiry into the Nature and Circumstances of the Debts demanded that no pretended Debt be claim'd for the private Account of the Debtor In order to which Enquiry they shall administer the following Oath to the Creditor for the Proof of the Debt  I A B do solemnly swear and attest That the Account hereto annex'd is true and right and every Article therein rightly and truly stated and charg'd in the Names of the Persons to whom they belong And that there is no Person or Name nam'd conceal'd or alterd in the said Account by me or by my Knowledge Order or Consent And that the said  does really and  bona fide  owe and stand indebted to me for my own proper account the full Sum of  mention'd in the said Account and that for a fair and just  Value made good to him as by the said Account express'd and also that I have not made or known of any Private Contract Promise or Agreement between him the said  or any body for him and me or any Person whatsoever  So help me God  Upon this Oath and no Circumstances to render the Person suspected the Creditor shall have an unquestion'd Right to his Dividend which shall be made without the Delays and Charges that attend the Commissions of Bankrupts For  The Goods of the Debtor shall upon the first meeting of the Creditors be either sold in Parcels as they shall agree or divided among them in due proportion to their Debts  What Debts are standing out the Debtors shall receive Summons's from the Commissioners to pay by a  certain time limited and in the mean time the Secretary is to transmit Accounts to the Persons owing it appointing them a reasonable time to consent or disprove the Account  And every Six Months a just Dividend shall be made among the Creditors of the Money receiv'd And so if the Effects lye abroad Authentick Procurations shall be sign'd by the Bankrupt to the Commissioners who thereupon correspond with the Persons abroad in whose hands such Effects are who are to remit the same as the Commissioners order the Dividend to be made as before every Six Months or oftner if the Court see cause  If any man thinks the Bankrupt has so much favour by these Articles that those who can dispense with an Oath have an opportunity to cheat their Creditors and that hereby too  much Encouragement is given to men to turn Bankrupt let them consider the Easiness of the Discovery the Difficulty of a Concealment and the Penalty on the Offender  I would have a Reward of  per Cent  be provided to be paid to any person who should make discovery of any part of the Bankrupt's Estate conceal'd by him which would make Discoveries easy and frequent  Any person who should claim any Debt among the Creditors for the account of the Bankrupt or his Wife or Children or with design to relieve them out of it other or more than is  bona fide  due to him for Value receiv'd and to be made out or any person who shall receive in Trust or by Deed of Gift any part of the Goods or other Estate of the Bankrupt with design to preserve them for the use of the said Bankrupt or his  Wife or Children or with design to conceal them from the Creditors shall forfeit for every such Act  l  and have his Name publish'd as a Cheat and a Person not fit to be credited by any man This would make it very difficult for the Bankrupt to conceal any thing  The Bankrupt having given his Name and put the Officer into Possession shall not remove out of the House any of his Books but during the Fourteen days time which he shall have to settle the Accounts shall every night deliver the Books into the hands of the Officer and the Commissioners shall have liberty if they please to take the Books the first day and cause Duplicates to be made and then to give them back to the Bankrupt to settle the Accounts  If it shall appear that the Bankrupt has given in a false Account  has conceal'd any part of his Goods or Debts in breach of his Oath he shall be set in the Pillory at his own door and be imprison'd during Life without Bail  To prevent the Bankrupt concealing any Debts abroad it should be enacted That the Name of the Bankrupt being entred at the Office where every man might search  gratis  should be Publication enough and that after such Entry no Discharge from the Bankrupt shou'd be allow'd in Account to any man but whoever wou'd adventure to pay any Money to the said Bankrupt or his Order shou'd be still Debtor to the Estate and pay it again to the Commissioners  And whereas Wiser Heads than mine must be employ'd to compose this Law if ever it be made they will have time to consider of more  ways to secure the Estate for the Creditors and if possible to tye the hands of the Bankrupt yet faster  This Law if ever such a Happiness shou'd arise to this Kingdom would be a present Remedy for a multitude of Evils which now we feel and which are a sensible detriment to the Trade of this Nation  With submission I question not but it wou'd prevent a great number of Bankrupts which now fall by divers Causes For  It wou'd effectually remove all crafty design'd Breakings by which many Honest Men are ruin'd And  Of course 'twou'd prevent the Fall of those Tradesmen who are forc'd to break by the Knavery of such  It wou'd effectually suppress all those Sanctuaries and Refuges of Thieves the  Mint Friars Savoy  Rules  and the like and that these two ways  Honest Men wou'd have no need of it here being a more Safe Easy and more Honourable Way to get out of Trouble  Knaves shou'd have no Protection from those Places and the Act be fortified against those Places by the following Clauses which I have on purpose reserv'd to this Head  Since the Provision this Court of Enquiries makes for the ease and deliverance of every Debtor who is honest is so considerable 'tis most certain that no man but he who has a design to Cheat his Creditors will refuse to accept of the Favour and therefore it shou'd be Enacted  That if any man who is a Tradesman or Merchant shall break or fail or shut up Shop or leave off Trade and shall not either pay or secure to  his Creditors their full and whole Debts Twenty Shillings in the Pound without Abatement or Deduction or shall convey away their Books or Goods in order to bring their Creditors to any Composition or shall not apply to this Office as aforesaid shall be guilty of Felony and upon Conviction of the same shall suffer as a Felon without Benefit of Clergy  And if any such person shall take Sanctuary either in the  Mint Friars  or other pretended PriviledgePlace or shall convey thither any of their Goods as aforesaid to secure them from their Creditors upon Complaint thereof made to any of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace they shall immediately grant Warrants to the Constable  c  to search for the said Persons and Goods who shall be aided and assisted by the Train'dBands if need be without any Charge to the Creditors  to search for and discover the said Persons and Goods and whoever were aiding in the carrying in the said Goods or whoever knowingly receiv'd either the Goods or the Person shou'd be also guilty of Felony  For as the Indigent Debtor is a branch of the Commonwealth which deserves its Care so the wilful Bankrupt is one of the  worst sort of Thieves  And it seems a little unequal that a poor Fellow who for mere Want steals from his Neighbour some Trifle shall be sent out of the Kingdom  and sometimes out of the World  while a sort of people who defye Justice and violently resist the Law shall be suffer'd to carry mens Estates away before their faces and no Officers to be found who dare execute the Law upon them  Any man wou'd be concern'd to hear with what Scandal and Reproach  Foreigners do speak of the Impotence of our Constitution in this Point That in a Civiliz'd Government as ours is the strangest Contempt of Authority is shown that can be instanc'd in the world  I may be a little the warmer on this Head on account that I have been a larger Sufferer by such means than ordinary But I appeal to all the world as to the Equity of the Case What the difference is between having my House broken up in the Night to be robb'd and a man coming in good Credit and with a Proffer of Ready Money in the middle of the Day and buying  l  of Goods and carry them directly from my Warehouse into the  Mint  and the next day laugh at me and bid me defiance yet this I have seen done I think 'tis the justest thing in the world that the last shou'd be  esteem'd the greater Thief and deserves most to be hang'd  I have seen a Creditor come with his Wise and Children and beg of the Debtor only to let him have part of his own Goods again which he had bought knowing and designing to break I have seen him with Tears and Intreaties petition for his own or but some of it and be taunted and swore at and denied by a sawcy insolent Bankrupt That the poor man has been wholly ruin'd by the Cheat 'Tis by the Villany of such many an Honest man is undone Families starv'd and sent a begging and yet no Punishment prescrib'd by our Laws for it  By the aforesaid  Commission of Enquiry  all this might be most effectually prevented an Honest Indigent Tradesman preserv'd Knavery detected and punish'd  Mints  Friars  and PrivilegePlaces suppress'd and without doubt a great number of Insolencies avoided and prevented of which many more Particulars might be insisted upon but I think these may be sufficient to lead any body into the Thought and for the Method I leave it to the wise Heads of the Nation who know better than I how to state the Law to the Circumstances of the Crime  Of ACADEMIES  WE have in  England  fewer of these than in any part of the World at least where Learning is in so much esteem But to make amends the two great Seminaries we have are without comparison the  Greatest  I won't say the  Best  in the World and  tho' much might be said here concerning Universities in general and Foreign Academies in particular I content my self with noting that part in which we seem defective The  French  who justly value themselves upon erecting the most Celebrated Academy of  Europe  owe the Lustre of it very much to the great Encouragement the Kings of  France  have given to it And one of the Members making a Speech at his Entrance tells you  That 'tis not the least of the Glories of their Invincible Monarch to have engross'd all the Learning of the World in that Sublime Body  The peculiar Study of the Academy of  Paris  has been to Refine and Correct their own Language which they have done to that happy degree that we see it now spoken in all the Courts of  Christendom  as the Language allow'd to be most universal  I had the Honour once to be a Member of a small Society who seem'd to offer at this Noble Design in  England  But the Greatness of the Work and the Modesty of the Gentlemen concern'd prevail'd with them to desist an Enterprize which appear'd too great for Private Hands to undertake We want indeed a  Richlieu  to commence such a Work For I am persuaded were there such a  Genius  in our Kingdom to lead the way there wou'd not want Capacities who cou'd carry on the Work to a Glory equal to all that has gone before them The  English  Tongue is a Subject not at all less worthy the Labour of such a Society than the  French  and capable of a much greater Perfection The Learned among the  French  will own That the Comprehensiveness of Expression is a Glory in which the  English  Tongue not only Equals but Excels  its Neighbours  Rapin  St  Evremont  and the most Eminent  French  Authors have acknowledg'd it And my Lord  Roscommon  who is allow'd to be a good Judge of  English  because he wrote it as exactly as any ever did expresses what I mean in these Lines  "For who did ever in  French  Authors see  "The Comprehensive  English  Energy  "The weighty  Bullion  of one  Sterling  Line  "Drawn to  French Wire  wou'd through whole Pages shine  "And if our Neighbours will yield us as their greatest Critick has done the Preference for Sublimity and Nobleness of Stile we will willingly quit all Pretensions to their Insignificant Gaiety  'Tis great pity that a Subject so Noble shou'd not have some as Noble to  attempt it And for a Method what greater can be set before us than the Academy of  Paris  Which to give the  French  their due stands foremost among all the Great Attempts in the Learned Part of the World  The present King of  England  of whom we have seen the whole World writing  Panegyricks  and  Encomiums  and whom his Enemies when their Interest does not silence them are apt to say more of than our selves as in the War he has given surprizing Instances of a Greatness of Spirit more than common so in Peace I dare say with Submission he shall never have an Opportunity to illustrate his Memory more than by such a Foundation By which he shall have Opportunity to darken the Glory of the  French  King in Peace as he has by his daring Attempts in the War  Nothing but Pride loves to be flatter'd and that only as 'tis a Vice which blinds us to our own Imperfections I think Princes as particularly unhappy in having their Good Actions magnify'd as their Evil Actions cover'd But King  William  who has already won Praise by the Steps of dangerous Virtue seems reserv'd for some Actions which are above the Touch of Flattery whose Praise is in themselves  And such wou'd this be And because I am speaking of a Work which seems to be proper only for the Hand of the King himself I shall not presume to carry on this Chapter to the Model as I have done in other Subjects Only thus far  That a Soceiety be erected by the King himself  if his Majesty thought fit  and composed of none but Persons of the first Figure in Learning and 'twere to be wish'd our Gentry  were so much Lovers of Learning that Birth might always be join'd with Capacity  The Work of this Society shou'd be to encourage Polite Learning to polish and refine the  English  Tongue and advance the so much neglected Faculty of Correct Language to establish Purity and Propriety of Stile and to purge it from all the Irregular Additions that Ignorance and Affectation have introduc'd and all those Innovations in Speech if I may call them such which some Dogmatic Writers have the Confidence to foster upon their Native Language as if their Authority were sufficient to make their own Fancy legitimate  By such a Society I dare say the true Glory of our  English  Stile wou'd appear and among all the Learned  Part of the World be esteem'd as it really is the Noblest and most Comprehensive of all the Vulgar Languages in the World  Into this Society should be admitted none but Persons Eminent for Learning and yet none or but very few whose Business or Trade was Learning For I may be allow'd I suppose to say We have seen many great Scholars meer Learned Men and Graduates in the last Degree of Study whose  English  has been far from Polite full of Stiffness and Affectation hard Words and long unusual Coupling of  Syllables  and Sentences which sound harsh and untuneable to the Ear and shock the Reader both in Expression and Understanding  In short There should be room in this Society for neither  Clergyman Physician  or  Lawyer  Not that I wou'd put an Affront upon the Learning of  any of those Honourable Employments much less upon their Persons But if I do think that their several Professions do naturally and severally prescribe Habits of Speech to them peculiar to their Practice and prejudicial to the Study I speak of I believe I do them no wrong Nor do I deny but there may be and now are among some of all those Professions Men of Stile and Language great Masters of  English  whom few men will undertake to Correct and where such do at any time appear their extraordinary Merit shou'd find them a Place in this Society but it shou'd be rare and upon very extraordinary Occasisions that such be admitted  I wou'd therefore have this Society wholly compos'd of Gentlemen whereof Twelve to be of the Nobility if possible and Twelve Private Gentlemen and a Class of Twelve  to be left open for meer Merit let it be fonnd in who or what sort it would which should lye as the Crown of their Study who have done something eminent to deserve it The Voice of this Society should be sufficient Authority for the Usage of Words and sufficient also to expose the Innovations of other mens Fancies they shou'd preside with a Sort of Judicature over the Learning of the Age and have liberty to Correct and Censure the Exorbitance of Writers especially of Translators The Reputation of this Society wou'd be enough to make them the allow'd Judges of Stile and Language and no Author wou'd have the Impudence to Coin without their Authority  Custom  which is now our best Authority for Words wou'd always have its Original here and not be allow'd without it There shou'd be no more  occasion to search for Derivations and Constructions and 'twou'd be as Criminal then to  Coin Words as Money  The Exercises of this Society wou'd be Lectures on the  English  Tongue Essays on the Nature Original Usage Authorities and Differences of Words on the Propriety Purity and  Cadence of Stile  and of the Politeness and  Manner  in Writing Reflections upon Irregular Usages and Corrections of Erroneous Customs in Words and in short every thing that wou'd appear necessary to the bringing our  English  Tongue to a due Perfection and our Gentlemen to a Capacity of Writing like themselves to banish Pride and Pedantry and silence the Impudence and Impertinence of Young Authors whose Ambition is to be known tho' it be by their Folly  I ask leave here for a Thought or two about that Inundation Custom has made upon our Language and Discourse by  Familiar Swearing  and I place it here because Custom has so far prevail'd in this foolish Vice that a man's Discourse is hardly agreeable without it and some have taken upon them to say  It is pity it shou'd not be lawful 'tis such a Grace in a man's Speech and adds so much Vigour to his Language  I desire to be understood right and that by Swearing I mean all those Cursory Oaths Curses Execrations Imprecations Asseverations and by whatsoever other Names they are distinguish'd which are us'd in Vehemence of Discourse in the Mouths almost of all men more or less of what sort soever  I am not about to argue any thing of their being sinful and unlawful as  forbid by Divine Rules  let the Parson alone to tell you that  who has no question said as much to as little purpose in this Case as in any other But I am of the opinion that there is nothing so Impertinent so Insignificant so Sensless and Foolish as our vulgar way of Discourse when mix'd with Oaths and Curses and I wou'd only recommend a little Consideration to our Gentlemen who have Sense and Wit enough and wou'd be asham'd to speak Nonsense in other things but value themselves upon their Parts I wou'd but ask them to put into Writing the CommonPlaces of their Discourse and read them over again and examine the  English  the  Cadence  the  Grammar  of them then let them turn them into  Latin  or translate them into any other Language and but see what a  Jargon  and Confusion of Speech they make together  Swearing  that Lewdness of the Tongue that Scum and Excrement of the Mouth is of all Vices the most foolish and sensless it makes a man's Conversation  unpleasant  his Discourse  fruitless  and his Language  Nonsense  It makes Conversation unpleasant at least to those who do not use the same foolish way of Discourse and indeed is an Affront to all the Company who swear not as he does for if I swear and Curse in Company I either presume all the Company likes it or affront them who do not  Then 'tis  fruitless  for no man is believ'd a jot the more for all the Asseverations  Damnings  and Swearings he makes Those who are us'd to it themselves do not believe a man the more because they know they are so customary that they signify little to bind a man's Intention  and they who practise them not have so mean an opinion of those that do as makes them think they deserve no belief  Then they are the Spoilers and Destroyers of a man's Discourse and turn it into perfect  Nonsense  and to make it out I must descend a little to Particulars and desire the Reader a little to foul his Mouth with the Bruitish Sordid Sensless Expressions which some Gentlemen call Polite  English  and speaking with a Grace  Some part of them indeed tho' they are foolish enough as Effects of a mad inconsiderate Rage are yet  English  as when a man swears he will do this or that and it may be adds  God damn him he will  that is  God damn him if he don't  This tho' it be horrid in another sense yet may  be read in writing and is  English  But what Language is this  Jack  God damn me  Jack  How do'st do thou little dear Son of a Whore How hast thou done this long time by God  And then they kiss and the t'other as lewd as himself goes on  Dear  Tom  I am glad to see thee with all my heart let me dye Come let us go take a Bottle we must not part so prithee let's go and be drunk by God  This is some of our new florid Language and the Graces and Delicacies of Stile which if it were put into  Latin  I wou'd fain know which is the principal Verb  But for a little further remembrance of this Impertinence go among the Gamesters and there nothing is more frequent than  God damn the Dice  or  God damn the Bowls  Among the Sportsmen 'tis  God damn the Hounds  when they are at a Fault or  God damn the Horse  if he bau'ks a Leap They call men  Sons of Bitches  and  Dogs Sons of Whores  And innumerable Instances may be given of the like Gallantry of Language grown now so much a  Custom  'Tis true Custom is allow'd to be our best Authority for Words and 'tis fit it should be so but Reason must be the Judge of Sense in Language and Custom can never prevail over it  Words  indeed like Ceremonies in Religion may be submitted to the Magistrate but  Sense  like the Essentials is positive unalterable and cannot be submitted to any Jurisdiction 'tis a Law to it self 'tis ever the same even an Act of Parliament cannot alter it  Words  and even Usages in Stile may be alter'd by Custom and Proprieties in Speech differ according to the several Dialects of the Countrey and according to the different manner in which several Languages do severally express themselves  But there is a direct Signification of Words or a  Cadence in Expression  which we call speaking  Sense  this like Truth is sullen and the same ever was and will be so in what manner and in what Language soever 'tis express'd  Words  without it are only Noise which any Brute can make as well as we and Birds much better for  Words  without  Sense  make but dull Musick Thus a man may speak in  Words  but perfectly unintelligible as to  Meaning  he may  talk  a great deal but  say  nothing But 'tis the proper Position of  Words  adapted to their Significations which makes them intelligible  and conveys the Meaning of the Speaker to the Understanding of the Hearer the contrary to which we call  Nonsense  and there is a superfluous crowding in of insignificant Words more than are needful to express the thing intended and this is  Impertinence  and that again carry'd to an extreme is  ridiculous  Thus when our Discourse is interlin'd with needless Oaths Curses and long  Parentheses  of Imprecations and with some of very indirect signification they become very  Impertinent  and these being run to the extravagant degree instanc'd in before become perfectly  ridiculous  and  Nonsense  and without forming it into an Argument it appears to be  Nonsense  by the Contradictoriness and it appears  Impertinent  by the Insignificancy of the Expression  After all how little it becomes a Gentleman to debauch his Mouth with Foul Language I refer to themselves in a few Particulars  This Vicious Custom has prevail'd upon Good Manners too far but yet there are some degrees to which it is not yet arriv'd  As first The worst Slaves to this Folly will neither teach it  to  nor approve of it  in  their Children Some of the most careless will indeed negatively teach it by not reproving them for it but sure no man ever order'd his Children to be taught to curse or swear  The Grace of Swearing has not obtain'd to be a Mode yet among the Women  God damn ye  does not sit well upon a Female Tongue it seems to be a Masculine Vice which the Women are not arriv'd to yet and I wou'd only desire those Gentlemen who practice it themselves to hear a Woman  swear It has no Musick at all there I am sure and just as little does it become any Gentleman if he wou'd suffer himself to be judg'd by all the Laws of Sense or Good Manners in the world  'Tis a sensless foolish ridiculous Practice 'tis a Mean to no manner of End 'tis Words spoken which signify nothing 'tis Folly acted for the sake of Folly which is a thing even the Devil himself don't practice The Devil does evil we say but it is for some design either to seduce others or as some Divines say from a Principle of Enmity to his Maker Men Steal for Gain and Murther to gratify their Avarice or Revenge Whoredoms and Ravishments Adulteries and Sodomy are committed to please a vicious Appetite and have always alluring Objects and generally all Vices have some previous Cause and  some visible Tendency but this of all Vicious Practices seems the most Nonsensical and Ridiculous there is neither Pleasure nor Profit no Design pursued no Lust gratified but is a mere Frenzy of the Tongue a Vomit of the Brain which works by putting a Contrary upon the Course of Nature  Again other Vices men find some Reason or other to give for or Excuses to palliate men plead Want to extenuate Theft and strong Provocations to excuse Murthers  and many a lame Excuse they will bring for Whoring  but this sordid Habit even those that practise it will own to be a Crime and make no Excuse for it and the most I cou'd ever hear a man say for it was That  he cou'd not help it  Besides as 'tis an inexcusable Impertinence so 'tis a Breach upon Good Manners and Conversation for a man  to impose the Clamour of his Oaths upon the Company he converses with if there be any one person in the Company that does not approve the way 'tis an imposing upon him with a freedom beyond Civility as if a man shou'd  Fart  before a Justice or  talk Bawdy  before the Queen or the like  To suppress this Laws Acts of Parliaments and Proclamations are Bawbles and Banters the Laughter of the Lewd Party and never had as I cou'd perceive any Influence upon the Practice nor are any of our Magistrates fond or forward of putting them in execution  It must be Example not Penalties must sink this Crime and if the Gentlemen of  England  wou'd once drop it as a Mode the Vice is so foolish and ridiculous in it self 'twou'd soon grow odious and out of fashion  This Work such an Academy might begin and I believe nothing wou'd so soon explode the Practice as the Publick Discouragement of it by such a Society Where all our Customs and Habits both in Speech and Behaviour shou'd receive an Authority All the Disputes about Precedency of Wit with the Manners Customs and Usages of the Theatre wou'd be decided here Plays shou'd pass here before they were Acted and the Criticks might give their Censures and damn at their pleasure nothing wou'd ever dye which once receiv'd Life at this Original The Two Theatres might end their Jangle and dispute for Priority no more Wit and Real Worth shou'd decide the Controversy and here shou'd be the  Infallible Judge  The Strife wou'd then be only to do well  And he alone be crown'd who did excell  Ye call'd them  Whigs  who from the Church withdrew  But now we have our  StageDissenters  too  Who  scruple Ceremonies  of Pit and Box  And very few are Sound and Orthodox  But love Disorder so and are so nice  They hate  Conformity  tho' 'tis in Vice  Some are for  PatentHierarchy  and some  Like the old  Gauls  seek out for Elbowroom  Their Arbitrary Governors disown  And build a  ConventicleStage  o' their own  Phanatick  Beaus  make up the gawdy Show  And Wit alone appears  Incognito  Wit and Religion suffer equal Fate  Neglect of both attends the warm Debate  For while the Parties strive and countermine  Wit will as well as Piety decline  Next to this which I esteem as the most Noble and most Useful Proposal in this Book I proceed to Academies for Military Studies and because I design rather to express my meaning than make a large Book I bring them all into one Chapter  I allow the War is the best Academy in the World where men study by Necessity and practise by Force and both to some purpose with Duty in the Action and a Reward in the End and 'tis evident to any man who knows the World or has made any Observations on things what an Improvement the  English  Nation has made during this Seven Years War  But should you ask how dear it first cost and what a condition  England  was in for a War at first on this account how almost all our Engineers and Great Officers were Foreigners it  may put us in mind how necessary it is to have our people so practis'd in the Arts of War that they may not be Novices when they come to the Experiment  I have heard some who were no great Friends to the Government take advantage to reflect upon the King in the beginning of his Wars in  Ireland  That he did not care to trust the  English  but all his Great Officers his Generals and Engineers were Foreigners And tho' the Case was so plain as to need no Answer and the Persons such as deserv'd none yet this must be observ'd tho' twas very strange That when the present King took Possession of this Kingdom and seeing himself entring upon the bloodiest War this Age has known began to regulate his Army he found but very few among the whole Martial Part of the Nation fit to make use of for General Officers and  was forced to employ Strangers and make them  Englishmen  as the Counts  Schomberg Ginkel Solms Ruvigny  and others And yet it is to be observ'd also that all the Encouragement imaginable was given to the  English  Gentlemen to qualify themselves by giving no less than Sixteen Regiments to Gentlemen of Good Families who had never been in any Service and knew but very little how to command them Of these several are now in the Army and have the Rewards suitable to their Merit being MajorGenerals Brigadeers and the like  If then a long Peace had so reduc'd us to a degree of Ignorance that might have been dangerous to us had we not a King who is always follow'd by the greatest Masters in the World Who knows what Peace and different Governors may bring us to again  The manner of making War differs perhaps as much as any thing in the world and if we look no further back than our Civil Wars 'tis plain a General  then  wou'd hardly be fit to be a Collonel now saving his Capacity of Improvement The Defensive Art always follows the Offensive and tho' the latter has extremely got the start of the former in this Age yet the other is mightily improving also  We saw in  England  a bloody Civil War where according to the old Temper of the  English  fighting was the Business To have an Army lying in such a Post as not to be able to come at them was a thing never heard of in that War even the weakest Party would always come out and fight  Dunbar  Fight for instance and they that were beaten to day would fight again to morrow and seek one another out with such Eagerness  as if they had been in haste to have their Brains knock'd out Encampments Intrenchments Batteries Countermarchings fortifying of Camps and Cannonadings were strange and almost unknown things and whole Campaigns were past over and hardly any Tents made use of Battels Surprizes Storming of Towns Skirmishes Sieges Ambuscades and Beating up Quarters was the News of every day Now 'tis frequent to have Armies of Fifty thousand men of a side stand at Bay within view of one another and spend a whole Campaign in Dodging or as 'tis genteely call'd  Observing one another  and then march off into WinterQuarters The difference is in the Maxims of War which now differ as much from what they were formerly as Long Perukes do from Piqued Beards or as the Habits of the People do now from what  they then wore The present Maxims of the War are  Never Fight without a manifest Advantage  And always Encamp so as not to be forc'd to it  And if two opposite Generals nicely observe both these Rules it is impossible they shou'd ever come to fight  I grant that this way of making War spends generally more Money and less Blood than former Wars did but then it spins Wars out to a greater Length and I almost question whether if this had been the way of Fighting of old our Civil War had not lasted till this day Their Maxim was  Whereever you meet your Enemy fight him  But the Case is quite different now and I think 'tis plain in the present War that 'tis not he who has the longest Sword so much as he who has the  longest Purse  will hold the War out best  Europe  is all engag'd in the War and the Men will never be exhausted while either Party can find Money but he who finds himself poorest must give out first and this is evident in the  French  King who now inclines to Peace and owns it while at the same time his Armies are numerous and whole but the Sinews fail he finds his Exchequer fail his Kingdom drain'd and Money hard to come at Not that I believe half the Reports we have had of the Misery and Poverty of the  French  are true but 'tis manifest the King of  France  finds whatever his Armies may do his Money won't hold out so long as the  Confederates  and therefore he uses  all the means possible to procure a Peace while he may do it with the most advantage  There is no question but the  French  may hold the War out several Years longer but their King is too wise to let things run to extremity he will rather condescend to Peace upon hard terms now than stay longer if he finds himself in danger to be forc'd to worse  This being the only Digression I design to be guilty of I hope I shall be excus'd it  The Sum of all is this That since 'tis so necessary to be in a condition for War in a time of Peace our People shou'd be inur'd to it 'Tis strange that every thing shou'd be ready but the Soldier Ships are ready and our Trade keeps the Seamen always  taught and breeds up more but Soldiers Horsemen Engineers Gunners and the like must be bred and taught men are not born with Muskets on their Shoulders nor Fortifications in their Heads 'tis not natural to shoot Bombs and undermine Towns For which purpose I propose  A Royal Academy for Military Exercises  The Founder the King himself the Charge to be paid by the Publick and settled by a Revenue from the Crown to be paid Yearly  I propose this to consist of Four Parts  A Colledge for breeding up of Artists in the useful Practice of all Military Exercises the Scholars to be taken in Young and be maintain'd  and afterwards under the King's Care for Preferment as their Merit and His Majesty's Favour shall recommend them from whence His Majesty wou'd at all times be furnish'd with able Engineers Gunners Firemasters Bombardiers Miners and the like  The Second College for Voluntary Students in the same Exercises who shou'd all upon certain limited Conditions be entertain'd and have all the advantages of the Lectures Experiments and Learning of the College and be also capable of several Titles Profits and Settlements in the said College answerable to the Fellows in the Universities  The Third College for Temporary Study into which any Person who is a Gentleman and an  Englishman  entring his Name and conforming to the Orders of the House shall be entertain'd like a Gentleman  for one whole Year  gratis  and taught by Masters appointed out of the Second College  The Fourth College of Schools only where all Persons whatsoever for a small Allowance shall be taught and entred in all the particular Exercises they desire and this to be suppli'd by the Proficients of the first College  I cou'd lay out the Dimensions and necessary Incidents of all this Work but since the Method of such a Foundation is easy and regular from the Model of other Colleges I shall only state the Oeconomy of the House  The Building must be very Large and shou'd rather be Stately and Magnificent in Figure than Gay and Costly in Ornament And I think such a House as  ChelseaCollege  only about  four times as big wou'd answer it and yet I believe might be finish'd for as little Charge as has been laid out in that  Palacelike Hospital  The First College should consist of  One General  Five Collonels  Twenty Captains  Being such as Graduates by Preferment at first nam'd by the Founder and after the first Settlement to be chosen out of the First or Second College with Apartments in the College and Salaries  The General  l per Ann  The Collonels    The Captains      Scholars  among whom shall be the following Degrees  Governors    Allow'd  l per An  Directors         Exempts         Proficients          Juniors          The  General  to be nam'd by the Founder out of the  Collonels  the  Collonels  to be nam'd by the  General  out of the  Captains  the  Captains  out of the  Governors  the  Governors  from the  Directors  and the  Directors  from the  Exempts  and so on  The  Juniors  to be divided into Ten Schools the Schools to be thus govern'd Every School has    Juniors  in  Classes  Every  Class  to have  Directors    Classes  of  Juniors  is    Each  Class    Directors         The  Proficients  to be divided into Five  Schools  Every  School  to have  Classes  of each  Every

An  for the Publick Uses of Exercises and Experiments  In the first of these Colleges should remain the GoverningPart and all the Preferments be made from thence to be suppli'd in course from the other the General of the first to give Orders to the other and be subject only to the Founder  The Government shou'd be all Military with a Constitution for the same regulated for that purpose and a Council to hear and determine the Differences and Trespasses by the CollegeLaws  The Publick Exercises likewise Military and all the Schools be disciplin'd under proper Officers who are so in turn or by Order of the General and continue but for the Day  The several Classes to perform several Studies and but one Study to a distinct Class and the Persons as they remove from one Study to another to change their Classes but so as that in  the General Exercises all the Scholars may be qualified to act all the several Parts as they may be order'd  The proper Studies of this College should be the following  Geometry  Astronomy  History  Navigation  Decimal Arithmetick  Trigonometry  Dialing  Gauging  Mining  Fireworking  Bombarding  Gunnery  Fortification  Encamping  Entrenching  Approaching  Attacking  Delineation  Architecture  Surveying  And all Arts or Sciences Appendixes to such as these  With Exercises for the Body to which all should be oblig'd as their Genius and Capacities led them As  Swimming  which no Soldier and indeed no Man whatever ought to be without  Handling all sorts of FireArms  Marching and Countermarching in Form  Fencing and the Long Staff  Riding and Managing or Horsemanship  Running Leaping and Wrestling  And herewith shou'd also be preserv'd and carefully taught all the Customs Usages  Terms of War  and  Terms of Art  us'd in Sieges Marches of Armies and Encampments that so a Gentleman taught in this College shou'd be no Novice when he comes into the King's Armies tho' he has seen no Service abroad I remember the  Story of an  English  Gentleman an Officer at the Siege of  Limerick  in  Ireland  who tho' he was Brave enough upon Action yet for the only matter of being ignorant in the Terms of Art and knowing not how to talk  CampLanguage  was expos'd to be laugh'd at by the whole Army for mistaking the opening of the Trenches which he thought had been a Mine against the Town  The Experiments of these Colleges wou'd be as well worth publishing as the Acts of the  Royal Society  To which purpose the House must be built where they may have Ground to cast Bombs to raise Regular Works as Batteries Bastions HalfMoons Redoubts Hornworks Forts and the like with the convenience of Water to draw round such Works to exercise the Engineers in all the necessary Experiments of Dreining and  Mining under Ditches There must be room to fire Great Shot at a distance to Canonade a Camp to throw all sorts of Fireworks and Machines that are or shall be invented to open Trenches form Camps  c  Their Publick Exercises will be also very diverting and more worth while for any Gentlemen to see than the Sights or Shews which our people in  England  are so fond of  I believe as a Constitution might be form'd from these Generals this wou'd be the Greatest the Gallantest and the most Useful Foundation in the World The  English  Gentry wou'd be the best qualifi'd and consequently best accepted abroad and most useful at home of any people in the world and His Majesty shou'd never more be expos'd to the necessity of employing Foreigners in the Posts of Trust and Service in His Armies  And that the whole Kingdom might in some degree be better qualifi'd for Service I think the following Project wou'd be very useful  When our Military Weapon was the  LongBow  at which our  English  Nation in some measure excell'd the whole World the meanest Countreyman was a good Archer and that which qualifi'd them so much for Service in the War was their Diversion in Times of Peace which also had this good Effect That when an Army was to be rais'd they needed no disciplining And for the Encouragement of the People to an Exercise so publickly Profitable an Act of Parliament was made to oblige every Parish to maintain Buts for the Youth in the Countrey to shoot at  Since our way of fighting is now alter'd and this destructive Engine the  Musquet  is the proper Arms for the  Soldier I could wish the Diversion also of the  English  would change too that our Pleasures and Profit might correspond 'Tis a great Hindrance to this Nation especially where StandingArmies are a Grievance that if ever a War commence men must have at least a Year before they are thought fit to face an Enemy to instruct them how to handle their Arms and newrais'd men are call'd  Raw Soldiers  To help this at least in some measure I wou'd propose That the Publick Exercises of our Youth shou'd by some Publick Encouragement  for Penalties won't do it  be drawn off from the foolish Boyish Sports of Cocking and Cricketing and from Tipling to shooting with a Firelock an Exercise as Pleasant as 'tis Manly and Generous and  Swimming  which is a thing so many ways profitable besides its being a great Preservative  of Health that methinks no Man ought to be without it  For  Shooting  the Colleges I have mention'd above having provided for the instructing the Gentry at the King's Charge the Gentry in return of that Favour shou'd introduce it among the Countreypeople which might easily be done thus  If every CountreyGentleman according to his degree wou'd contribute to set up a Prize to be shot for by the Town he lives in or the Neighbourhood about once a year or twice a year or oftner as they think fit which Prize not single only to him who shoots nearest but according to the Custom of Shooting  This wou'd certainly set all the Young Men in  England  a shooting and make them Marksmen for they wou'd be always practising and making  Matches among themselves too and the advantage wou'd be found in a War for no doubt if all the Soldiers in a Battalion took a true Level at their Enemy there wou'd be much more Execution done at a distance than there is whereas it has been known now that a Battalion of men has receiv'd the Fire of another Battalion and not lost above or men and I suppose it will not easily be forgot how at the Battel of  Agrim  a Battalion of the  English  Army receiv'd the whole Fire of an  Irish  Regiment of Dragoons but never knew to this day whether they had any Bullets or no and I need appeal no further than to any Officer that serv'd in the  Irish  War what advantages the  English  Armies made of the  Irish  being such wonderful Marksmen  Under this Head of  Academies  I might bring in a Project for  An Academy for Women  I Have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous Customs in the world considering us as a Civiliz'd and a Christian Countrey that we deny the advantages of Learning to Women We reproach the Sex every day with Folly and Impertinence while I am confident had they the advantages of Education equal to us they wou'd be guilty of less than our selves  One wou'd wonder indeed how it shou'd happen that Women are conversible at all since they are only beholding to Natural Parts for all their Knowledge Their Youth is spent to teach them to Stitch and Sow or make Bawbles They are taught to Read indeed and perhaps to Write their Names or so and that is the  heighth of a Woman's Education And I wou'd but ask any who slight the Sex for their Understanding What is a Man a Gentleman I mean good for that is taught no more  I need not give Instances or examine the Character of a Gentleman with a good Estate and of a good Family and with tolerable Parts and examine what Figure he makes for want of Education  The Soul is plac'd in the Body like a rough Diamond and must be polish'd or the Lustre of it will never appear And 'tis manifest that as the Rational Soul distinguishes us from Brutes so Education carries on the distinction and makes some less brutish than others This is too evident to need any demonstration But why then shou'd Women be deni'd the benefit of Instruction If Knowledge and Understanding had been  useless additions to the Sex God Almighty wou'd never have given them Capacities for he made nothing needless Besides I wou'd ask such What they can see in Ignorance that they shou'd think it a necessary Ornament to a Woman Or how much worse is a Wise Woman than a Fool Or what has the Woman done to forfeit the Privilege of being taught Does she plague us with her Pride and Impertinence Why did we not let her learn that she might have had more Wit Shall we upbraid Women with Folly when 'tis only the Error of this inhuman Custom that hindred them being made wiser  The Capacities of Women are suppos'd to be greater and their Senses quicker than those of the Men and what they might be capable of being bred to is plain from some Instances of FemaleWit which this Age is not  without which upbraids us with Injustice and looks as if we deni'd Women the advantages of Education for fear they shou'd  vye  with the Men in their Improvements  To remove this Objection and that Women might have at least a needful Opportunity of Education in all sorts of Useful Learning I propose the Draught of an Academy for that purpose  I know 'tis dangerous to make Publick Appearances of the Sex they are not either to be  confin'd  or  expos'd  the first will disagree with their Inclinations and the last with their Reputations and therefore it is somewhat difficult and I doubt a Method propos'd by an Ingenious Lady in a little Book call'd  Advice to the Ladies  would be found impracticable For saving my Respect to the Sex the Levity which perhaps is a little peculiar  to them at least in their Youth will not bear the Restraint and I am satisfi'd nothing but the heighth of Bigotry can keep up a Nunnery Women are extravagantly desirous of going to Heaven and will punish their  Pretty Bodies  to get thither but nothing else will do it and even in that case sometimes it falls out that  Nature will prevail  When I talk therefore of an Academy for Women I mean both the Model the Teaching and the Government different from what is propos'd by that Ingenious Lady for whose Proposal I have a very great Esteem and also a great Opinion of her Wit different too from all sorts of Religious Confinement and above all from  Vows of Celibacy  Wherefore the Academy I propose should differ but little from Publick Schools wherein such Ladies as were  willing to study shou'd have all the advantages of Learning suitable to their Genius  But since some Severities of Discipline more than ordinary wou'd be absolutely necessary to preserve the Reputation of the House that Persons of Quality and Fortune might not be a fraid to venture their Children thither I shall venture to make a small Scheme by way of Essay  The House I wou'd have built in a Form by it self as well as in a Place by it self  The Building shou'd be of Three plain Fronts without any Jettings or BearingWork that the Eye might at a Glance see from one Coin to the other the Gardens wall'd in the same Triangular Figure with a large Moat and but one Entrance  When thus every part of the Scituation was contriv'd as well as might be for discovery and to render  Intrieguing  dangerous I wou'd have no Guards no Eyes no Spies set over the Ladies but shall expect them to be try'd by the Principles of Honour and strict Virtue  And if I am ask'd  Why  I must ask Pardon of my own Sex for giving this reason for it  I am so much in Charity with Women and so well acquainted with Men that 'tis my opinion There needs no other Care to prevent Intrieguing than to keep the men effectually away For tho'  Inclination  which we prettily call  Love  does sometimes move a little too visibly in the Sex and Frailty often follows yet I think verily  Custom  which we miscall  Modesty  has so far the Ascendant over the Sex that  Solicitation  always goes before it  Custom with Women 'stead of Virtue rules  It leads the Wisest and commands the Fools  For this alone when Inclinations reign  Tho' Virtue's fled will Acts of Vice restrain  Only by Custom 'tis that Virtue lives  And Love requires to be ask'd before it gives  For that which we call  Modesty  is  Pride  They scorn to ask and hate to be deni'd  'Tis Custom thus prevails upon their Want  They'll never beg what askt they eas'ly grant  And when the needless Ceremony's over  Themselves the Weakness of the Sex discover  If then Desires are strong and Nature free  Keep from her Men and Opportunity  Else 'twill be vain to curb her by Restraint  But keep the Question off you keep the Saint  In short let a Woman have never such a ComingPrinciple she will let you ask before she complies at least if she be a Woman of any Honour  Upon this ground I am persuaded such Measures might be taken that the Ladies might have all the Freedom in the world within their own Walls and yet no Intrieguing no Indecencies nor Scandalous Affairs happen and in order to this the following Customs and Laws shou'd be observ'd in the Colleges of which I wou'd propose One at least in every County in  England  and about Ten for the City of  London  After the Regulation of the Form of the Building as before  All the Ladies who enter into the House shou'd set their Hands to the Orders of the House to signify their Consent to submit to them  As no Woman shou'd be receiv'd but who declar'd her self willing and that it was the Act of her Choice to enter her self so no Person shou'd be confin'd to continue there a moment longer  than the same voluntary Choice inclin'd her  The Charges of the House being to be paid by the Ladies every one that entred shou'd have only this Incumbrance That she shou'd pay for the whole Year tho' her mind shou'd change as to her continuance  An Act of Parliament shou'd make it Felony without Clergy for any man to enter by Force or Fraud into the House or to solicit any Woman  tho' it were to Marry  while she was in the House And this Law wou'd by no means be severe because any Woman who was willing to receive the Addresses of a Man might discharge her self of the House when she pleas'd and on the contrary any Woman who had occasion might discharge her self of the Impertinent Addresses of any Person she had an Aversion to by entring into the House  In this House  The Persons who Enter shou'd be taught all sorts of Breeding suitable to both their Genius and their Quality and in particular  Musick  and  Dancing  which it wou'd be cruelty to bar the Sex of because they are their Darlings But besides this they shou'd be taught Languages as particularly  French  and  Italian  and I wou'd venture the Injury of giving a Woman more Tongues than one  They shou'd as a particular Study be taught all the Graces of Speech and all the necessary Air of Conversation which our common Education is so defective in that I need not expose it They shou'd be brought to read Books and especially History and so to read as to make them understand the World  and be able to know and judge of things when they hear of them  To such whose Genius wou'd lead them to it I wou'd deny no sort of Learning but the chief thing in general is to cultivate the Understandings of the Sex that they may be capable of all sorts of Conversation that their Parts and Judgments being improv'd they may be as Profitable in their Conversation as they are Pleasant  Women in my observation have little or no difference in them but as they are or are not distinguish'd by Education Tempers indeed may in some degree influence them but the main distinguishing part is their Breeding  The whole Sex are generally Quick and Sharp I believe I may be allow'd to say generally so for you rarely see them lumpish and heavy when they are Children as Boys will often be If a Woman be wellbred and taught  the proper Management of her Natural Wit she proves generally very sensible and retentive And without partiality a Woman of Sense and Manners is the Finest and most Delicate Part of God's Creation the Glory of her Maker and the great Instance of his singular regard to Man his Darling Creature to whom he gave the best Gift either God could bestow or man receive And 'tis the sordid'st Piece of Folly and Ingratitude in the world to withhold from the Sex the due Lustre which the advantages of Education gives to the Natural Beauty of their Minds  A Woman well Bred and well Taught furnish'd with the additional Accomplishments of Knowledge and Behaviour  is a Creature without comparison  her Society is the Emblem of sublimer Enjoyments her Person is Angelick and her Conversation heavenly  she is all Softness and Sweetness Peace Love Wit and Delight She is every way suitable to the sublimest Wish and the man that has such a one to his Portion has nothing to do but to rejoice in her and be thankful  On the other hand Suppose her to be the  very same  Woman and rob her of the Benefit of Education and it follows thus  If her Temper be Good want of Education makes her Soft and Easy  Her Wit for want of Teaching makes her Impertinent and Talkative  Her Knowledge for want of Judgment and Experience makes her Fanciful and Whimsical  If her Temper be Bad want of Breeding makes her worse and she grows Haughty Insolent and Loud  If she be Passionate want of Manners makes her Termagant and a  Scold  which is much at one with Lunatick  If she be Proud want of Discretion which still is Breeding makes her Conceited Fantastick and Ridiculous  And from these she degenerates to be Turbulent Clamorous Noisy Nasty  and the Devil  Methinks Mankind for their own sakes since say what we will of the Women we all think fit one time or other to be concern'd with 'em shou'd take some care to breed them up to be  suitable  and  serviceable  if they expected no such thing as  Delight  from 'em Bless us What Care do we take to Breed up a good Horse and to Break him well and what a Value do we put upon him when it is done and all because he shou'd be fit for our use and why not a Woman Since all her Ornaments and Beauty without  suitable Behaviour is a Cheat in Nature like the false Tradesman who puts the best of his Goods uppermost that the Buyer may think the rest are of the same Goodness  Beauty of the Body which is the Womens Glory seems to be now unequally bestow'd and Nature or rather Providence to lye under some Scandal about it as if 'twas given a Woman for a Snare to Men and so make a kind of a  SheDevil  of her Because they say Exquisite Beauty is  rarely  given with Wit  more rarely  with Goodness of Temper and  never at all  with Modesty And some pretending to justify the Equity of such a Distribution will tell us 'tis the Effect of the Justice of Providence in dividing particular Excellencies among all his Creatures  share and share alike as it were  that all might for something or other be acceptable to  one another else some wou'd be despis'd  I think both these Notions false and yet the last which has the shew of Respect to Providence is the worst for it supposes Providence to be Indigent and Empty as if it had not wherewith to furnish all the Creatures it had made but was fain to be parcimonious in its Gifts and distribute them by  piecemeal  for fear of being exhausted  If I might venture my Opinion against an almost universal Notion I wou'd say Most men mistake the Proceedings of Providence in this case and all the world at this day are mistaken in their Practice about it And because the Assertion is very bold I desire to explain my self  That Almighty First Cause which made us all is certainly the Fountain of Excellence as it is of Being and  by an Invisible Influence could have diffused Equal Qualities and Perfections to all the Creatures it has made as the Sun does its Light without the least Ebb or Diminution to himself and has given indeed to every individual sufficient to the Figure his Providence had design'd him in the world  I believe it might be defended if I should say That I do suppose God has given to all Mankind equal Gifts and Capacities in that he has given them all  Souls  equally capable and that the whole difference in Mankind proceeds either from Accidental Difference in the Make of their Bodies or from the  foolish Difference  of Education    From Accidental Difference in Bodies  I wou'd avoid discoursing here of the Philosophical Position of the Soul in the Body But if it be true  as Philosophers do affirm That the Understanding and Memory is dilated or contracted according to the accidental Dimensions of the Organ through which 'tis convey'd then tho' God has given a Soul as capable to me as another yet if I have any Natural Defect in those Parts of the Body by which the Soul shou'd act I may have the same Soul infus'd as another man and yet he be a Wise Man and I a very Fool  For example  If a Child naturally have a Defect in the Organ of Hearing so that he cou'd never distinguish any Sound that Child shall never be able to speak or read tho' it have a Soul capable of all the Accomplishments in the world The Brain is the Centre of the Souls actings where all the distinguishing Faculties of it reside and 'tis observable A man who has a narrow contracted Head in which there  is not room for the due and necessary Operations of Nature by the Brain is never a man of very great Judgment and that Proverb  A Great Head and Little Wit  is not meant by Nature but is a Reproof upon Sloth as if one shou'd by way of wonder say  Fye fye you that have a Great Head have but Little Wit that's strange that must certainly be your own fault  From this Notion I do believe there is a great matter in the Breed of Men and Women not that Wise Men shall always get Wise Children but I believe Strong and Healthy Bodies have the Wisest Children and Sickly Weakly Bodies affect the Wits as well as the Bodies of their Children We are easily persuaded to believe this in the Breeds of Horses Cocks Dogs and other Creatures and I believe 'tis as visible in Men  But to come closer to the business the great distinguishing difference which is seen in the world between Men and Women is in their Education and this is manifested by comparing it with the difference between one Man or Woman and another  And herein it is that I take upon me to make such a bold Assertion That all the World are mistaken in their Practice about Women For I cannot think that God Almighty ever made them so delicate so glorious Creatures and furnish'd them with such Charms so Agreeable and so Delightful to Mankind with Souls capable of the same Accomplishments with Men and all to be only Stewards of our Houses  Cooks and Slaves  Not that I am for exalting the Female Government in the least But in short  I would have Men take Women for Companions and Educate them to be  fit for it  A Woman of Sense and Breeding will scorn as much to encroach upon the Prerogative of the Man as a Man of Sense will scorn to oppress the  Weakness  of the Woman But if the Womens Souls were refin'd and improv'd by Teaching that word wou'd be lost to say  The Weakness of the Sex  as to Judgment wou'd be Nonsense for Ignorance and Folly wou'd be no more to be found among Women than Men I remember a Passage which I heard from a very Fine Woman she had Wit and Capacity enough an Extraordinary Shape and Face and a Great Fortune but had been cloyster'd up all her time and for fear of being stoll'n had not had the liberty of being taught the common necessary knowledge of Womens Affairs and when she came to converse in the world her Natural Wit made her so sensible  of the want of Education that she gave this short Reflection on her self  I am asham'd to talk with my very Maids  says she  for I don't know when they do right or wrong I had more need go to School than be Married  I need not enlarge on the Loss the Defect of Education is to the Sex nor argue the Benefit of the contrary Practice 'tis a thing will be more easily granted than remedied This Chapter is but an Essay at the thing and I refer the Practice to those Happy Days if ever they shall be when men shall be wise enough to mend it  Of a COURTMERCHANT  I Ask Pardon of the Learned Gentlemen of the  Long Robe  if I do 'em any wrong in this Chapter having no design to affront 'em when I say That in Matters of Debate among Merchants when they come to be argued by Lawyers at the Bar they are strangely handled I my self have heard very famous Lawyers make sorry Work of a Cause between the Merchant and his Factor and when they come to argue about  Exchanges Discounts Protests Demorages CharterParties Fraights PortCharges Assurances Barratries Bottomries Accounts Currant Accounts in Commission  and  Accounts in Company  and the like the Sollicitor has not been able to draw a Brief nor the Council to understand  it Never was Young Parson more put to it to make out his Text when he's got into the Pulpit without his Notes than I have seen a Council at the Bar when he wou'd make out a Cause between two Merchants And I remember a pretty History of a particular Case by way of Instance When two Merchants contending about a long FactorageAccount that had all the Niceties of Merchandizing in it and labouring on both sides to instruct their Council and to put them in when they were out at last they found them make such ridiculous stuff off it that they both threw up the Cause and agreed to a Reference which Reference in one Week without any Charge ended all the Dispute which they had spent a great deal of Money in before to no purpose  Nay the very Judges themselves no Reflection upon their Learning have been very much at a loss in giving Instructions to a Jury and Juries much more to understand them for when all is done Juries which are not always nor often indeed of the Wisest Men are to be sure ill Umpires in Causes so nice that the very Lawyer and Judge can hardly understand them  The Affairs of Merchants are accompanied with such variety of Circumstances such new and unusual Contingences which change and differ in every Age with a multitude of Niceties and Punctilio's and those again altering as the Customs and Usages of Countries and States do alter that it has been found impracticable to make any Laws that could extend to all Cases And our Law it self does tacitly acknowledge its own  Imperfection in this Case by allowing the  Custom of Merchants  to pass as a kind of Law in cases of Difficulty  Wherefore it seems to me a most Natural Proceeding That such Affairs shou'd be heard before and judg'd by such as by known Experience and long Practice in the Customs and Usages of Foreign Negoce are of course the most capable to determine the same  Besides the Reasonableness of the Argument there are some Cases in our Laws in which it is impossible for a Plaintiff to make out his Case or a Defendant to make out his Plea as in particular when his Proofs are beyond Seas for no Protests Certifications or Procurations are allow'd in our Courts as Evidence and the Damages are Infinite and Irretrievable by any of the Proceedings of our Laws  For the answering all these Circumstances a Court might be erected by Authority of Parliament to be compos'd of Six Judges Commissioners who shou'd have Power to Hear and Decide as a Court of Equity under the Title of  A CourtMerchant  The Proceedings of this Court shou'd be short the Trials speedy the Fees easy that every man might have immediate Remedy where Wrong is done For in Trials at Law about Merchants Affairs the Circumstances of the Case are often such as the long Proceedings of Courts of Equity are more pernicious than in other Cases because the matters to which they are generally relating are under greater Contingences than in other cases as Effects in hands abroad which want Orders Ships and Seamen  lying at Demoreage and in Pay and the like  These Six Judges shou'd be chosen of the most Eminent Merchants of the Kingdom to reside in  London  and to have Power by Commission to summon a Council of Merchants who shou'd decide all Cases on the Hearing of both Parties with Appeal to the said Judges  Also to delegate by Commission Petty Councils of Merchants in the most considerable Ports of the Kingdom for the same purpose  The Six Judges themselves to be only Judges of Appeal all Trials to be heard before the Council of Merchants by Methods and Proceedings Singular and Concise  The Council to be sworn to do Justice and to be chosen annually out of the principal Merchants of the City  The Proceedings here shou'd be without Delay the Plaintiff to exhibit his Grievance by way of Brief and the Defendant to give in his Answer and a time of Hearing to be appointed immediately  The Defendant by Motion shall have liberty to put off Hearing upon showing good Cause not otherwise  At Hearing every man to argue his own Cause if he pleases or introduce any person to do it for him  Attestations and Protests from Foreign Parts regularly procur'd and authentickly signifi'd in due Form to pass in Evidence Affidavits in due Form likewise attested and done before proper Magistrates within the King's Dominions to be allow'd as Evidence  The Party griev'd may appeal to the Six Judges before whom they shall  plead by Council and from their Judgment to have no Appeal  By this Method Infinite Controversies wou'd be avoided and Disputes amicably ended a multitude of present Inconveniences avoided and MerchandizingMatters wou'd in a Merchantlike manner be decided by the known Customs and Methods of Trade  Of SEAMEN  IT is observable That whenever this Kingdom is engaged in a War with any of its Neighbours two great Inconveniences constantly follow one to the  King  and one to  Trade  That to the  King  is That he is forced to press Seamen for the Manning of his Navy and force them involuntarily into the Service Which way of violent dragging men into the Fleet is attended with sundry ill circumstances As  Our Naval Preparations are retarded and our Fleets always late for want of Men which has expos'd them not a little and been the ruin of many a good and welllaid Expedition  Several Irregularities follow as the Officers taking Money to dismiss Able Seamen and filling up their Complement with raw and improper Persons  Oppressions Quarrelings and oftentimes Murthers by the rashness of Pressmasters and the obstinacy of some unwilling to go  A secret Aversion to the Service from a Natural Principle common to the  English  Nation to hate Compulsion  Kidnapping people out of the Kingdom robbing Houses and picking Pockets frequently practised under pretence of Pressing as has been very much used of late  With various Abuses of the like nature some to the King and some to the Subject  To  Trade  By the extravagant Price set on Wages for Seamen which they impose on the Merchant with a sort of Authority and he is obliged to give by reason of the Scarcity of Men and that not from a real want of Men for in the heighth of a Press if a Merchantman wanted Men and could get a Protection for them he might have any number immediately  and none without it so shye were they of the Publick Service  The First of these things has cost the King above Three Millions  Sterling  since the War in these Three Particulars  Charge of Pressing on Sea and on Shore and in small Craft employed for that purpose  Ships lying in Harbour for want of Men at a vast Charge of Pay and Victuals for those they had  Keeping the whole Navy in constant Pay and Provisions all the Winter for fear of losing the Men against Summer which has now been done several Years besides BountyMoney and other Expences to court and oblige the Seamen  The Second of these  viz  the great Wages paid by the Merchant has cost Trade since the War above  Twenty Millions  Sterling  The CoalTrade gives a Specimen of it who for the first Three Years of the War gave  l  a Voyage to Common Seamen who before sailed for  s  which computing the number of Ships and Men used in the CoalTrade and of Voyages made at hands to a Vessel does modestly accounting make  l  difference in one year in Wages to Seamen in the CoalTrade only  For other Voyages the difference of Sailors Wages is  s per  Month and  s per  Month to Foremastmen who before went for  s per  Month besides subjecting the Merchant to the Insolence of the Seamen who are not now to be pleased with any Provisions will admit no HalfPay and command of the Captains even what they please nay the King himself can hardly please them  For Cure of these Inconveniences it is the following Project is propos'd with which the Seamen can have no reason to be dissatisfied nor are not at all injur'd and yet the Damage sustain'd will be prevented and an immense Sum of Money spar'd which is now squander'd away by the Profuseness and Luxury of the Seamen For if Prodigality weakens the Publick Wealth of the Kingdom in general then are the Seamen but ill Commonwealthsmen who are not visibly the Richer for the prodigious Sums of Money paid them either by the King or the Merchant  The Project is this  That by an Act of Parliament an Office or Court be erected within the Jurisdiction of the Court of Admiralty and subject to the Lord High Admiral  or otherwise Independent and subject only to a Parliamentary Authority as the Commission for taking and stating the Publick Accounts  In this Court or Office or the several Branches of it which to that end shall be subdivided and plac'd in every SeaPort in the Kingdom shall be listed and entred into immediate Pay all the Seamen in the Kingdom who shall be divided into Colleges or Chambers of sundry degrees suitable to their several Capacities with Pay in proportion to their Qualities as  Boys Youths Servants Men Able and Raw Midshipmen Officers Pilots Old Men  and  Pensioners  The Circumstantials of this Office  No Captain or Master of any Ship or Vessel shou'd dare to hire or carry to Sea with him any Seaman but such as he shall receive from the Office aforesaid  No man whatsoever Seaman or other but applying himself to the said Office to be employ'd as a Sailor shou'd immediately enter into Pay and receive for every Able Seaman  s per  Month and Juniors in proportion to receive HalfPay while unemploy'd and liberty to work for themselves only to be at Call of the Office and leave an account where to be found  No Sailor cou'd desert because no Employment wou'd be to be had elsewhere  All Ships at their clearing at the Customhouse shou'd receive a Ticket to the Office for Men where wou'd be always Choice rather than Scarcity who shou'd be deliver'd over by the Office to the Captain or Master without any Trouble or Delay all liberty of Choice to be allow'd both to Master and Men only so as to give up all Disputes to the Officers appointed to decide  Note  By this wou'd be avoided the great Charge Captains and Owners are at to keep Men on Board before they are ready to go whereas now the care of getting Men will be over and all come on board in one day for the Captain carrying the Ticket to the Office he may go and chuse his Men if he will otherwise they will be sent on board him by Tickets sent to their Dwellings to repair on board such a Ship  For all these Men that the Captain or Master of the Ship takes he shall pay the Office not the Seamen  s per  Month which  s per  Month Overplus of Wages will be employ'd to pay the HalfPay to the men out of Employ and so in proportion of Wages for Juniors  All Disputes concerning the mutinying of Mariners or other matters  of Debate between the Captains and Men to be tri'd by way of Appeal in a Court for that purpose to be erected as aforesaid  All discounting of Wages and Time all Damages of Goods Avarages stopping of Pay and the like to be adjusted by stated and Publick Rules and Laws in Print establish'd by the same Act of Parliament by which means all litigious Suits in the Court of Admiralty which are Infinite would be prevented  No Ship that is permitted to enter at the CustomHouse and take in Goods should ever be refus'd Men or delay'd in the delivering them above five days after a Demand made and a Ticket from the Customhouse deliver'd general Cases as Arrests and Embargoes excepted  The Consequences of this Method  By this means the Publick wou'd have no want of Seamen and all the Charges and other Inconveniences of Pressing Men would be prevented  The intolerable Oppression upon Trade from the Exorbitance of Wages and Insolence of Mariners wou'd be taken off  The following Sums of Money shou'd be paid to the Office to lye in Bank as a Publick Fund for the Service of the Nation to be dispos'd of by Order of Parliament and not otherwise a Committee being always substituted in the Intervals of the Session to audit the Accounts and a Treasury for the Money to be compos'd of Members of the House and to be chang'd every Session of Parliament  Four Shillings  per  Month Wages advanc'd by the Merchants to the Office for the Men more than the Office pays them  In consideration of the reducing Mens Wages and consequently Fraights to the former Prices or near them  the Owners of Ships  or Merchants shall pay at the Importation of all Goods  s per Ton  Freight to be stated upon all Goods and Ports in proportion reckoning it on Wine Tonnage from  Canaries  as the Standard and on special Freights in proportion to the Freight formerly paid and half the said Price in times of Peace  Note  This may well be done and no Burthen for if Freights are reduced to their former Prices or near it as they will be if Wages are so too then the Merchant may well pay it As for Instance Freight from  Jamaica  to London  formerly at    l    s  per Ton  now at    and    l From  Virginia  at    l to    l    s now at    and    l From  Barbadoes  at    l now at    l From  Oporto  at    l now at    l and the like  The Payment of the abovesaid Sums being a large Bank for a Fund and it being supposed to be in fair hands and currently managed the Merchants shall further pay upon all Goods shipp'd out and shipp'd on board from abroad for and from any Port of this Kingdom  l per Cent  on the real Value  bona fide  to be sworn to if demanded In consideration whereof the said Office shall be obliged to pay and make good all Losses Damages Avarages and Casualties whatsoever as fully as by the Custom of Assurances now is done  without any Discounts Rebates or Delays whatsoever the said  l per Cent  to be stated on the Voyage to the  Barbadoes  and enlarged or taken off in proportion to the Voyage by Rules and Laws to be Printed and publickly known  Reserving only That then as reason good the said Office shall have Power to direct Ships of all sorts how and in what manner and how long they shall sail with or wait for Convoys and shall have Power with Limitations to lay Embargoes on Ships in order to compose Fleets for the benefit of Convoys  These Rules formerly noted to extend to all Trading by Sea the Coasting and HomeFishing Trade excepted and for them it should be order'd  First For Coals the Colliers being provided with Men at  s per  Month and Convoys in sufficient number and proper Stations from  TinmouthBar  to the River so as they need not go in Fleets but as Wind and Weather presents run all the way under the Protection of the Men of War who shou'd be continually cruising from Station to Station they would be able to perform their Voyage in as short time as formerly and at as cheap Pay and consequently cou'd afford to sell their Coals at  s per  Chaldron as well as formerly at  s  Wherefore there shou'd be paid into the Treasury appointed at  Newcastle  by Bond to be paid where they deliver  s per  Chaldron  Newcastle  Measure and the stated  Price at  London  to be  s per  Chaldron in the  Pool  which is  s  at the Buyers House and is so far from being dear a time of War especially as it is cheaper than ever was known in a War and the Officers shou'd by Proclamation confine the Seller to that Price  In consideration also of the Charge of Convoys the Ships bringing Coals shall all pay  l per Cent  on the Value of the Ship to be agreed on at the Office and all ConvoyMoney exacted by Commanders of Ships shall be relinquish'd and the Office to make good all Losses of Ships  not Goods  that shall be lost by Enemies only  These Heads indeed are such as wou'd need some Explication if the Experiment were to be made and with submission wou'd reduce the Seamen  to better Circumstances at least 'twou'd have them in readiness for any Publick Service much easier than by all the late methods of Encouragement by registring Seamen  c  For by this Method all the Seamen in the Kingdom shou'd be the King's hired Servants and receive their Wages from him  whoever employ'd them  and no man cou'd hire or employ them but from him The Merchant shou'd hire them of the King and pay the King for them nor wou'd there be a Seaman in  England  out of Employ  which by the way wou'd prevent their seeking Service abroad  If they were not actually at Sea they wou'd receive HalfPay and might be employ'd in Works about the Yards Stores and Navy to keep all things in Repair  If a Fleet or Squadron was to be fitted out they wou'd be mann'd in a Week's time for all the Seamen in  England  wou'd be ready Nor wou'd they be shye of the Service for  it is not  an Aversion to the King's Service nor  'tis not  that the Duty is harder in the Men of War than the Merchantmen nor  'tis not  fear of Danger which makes our Seamen lurk and hide and hang back in a time of War but 'tis  Wages  is the matter  s per  Month in the King's Service and to  s per  Month from the Merchant is the true cause and the Seaman is in the right of it too for who wou'd serve his King and Countrey and fight and be knock'd o' the head at  s per  Month that can have  s  without that hazard And till this be remedied in vain are all the Encouragements which can be given to Seamen for  they tend but to make them Insolent and encourage their Extravagance  Nor wou'd this Proceeding be any damage to the Seamen in general for  s per  Month Wages and to be kept in constant Service or HalfPay when idle is really better to the Seamen than  s per  Month as they now take it considering how long they often lye idle on shore out of Pay For the extravagant Price of Seamens Wages tho' it has been an Intolerable Burthen to Trade has not visibly enrich'd the Sailors and they may as well be content with  s per  Month now as formerly  On the other hand Trade wou'd be sensibly reviv'd by it the intolerable Price of Freights wou'd be reduced and the Publick wou'd reap an immense Benefit by the Payments mention'd in the Proposal as    s per  Month upon the Wages of all the Seamen employ'd by the Merchant which if we allow Seamen always in Employ as there cannot be less in all the Ships belonging to  England  is  l per  Month    s per  Ton Freight upon all Goods imported    per Cent  on the Value of all Goods exported or imported    s per  Chaldron upon all the Coals shipp'd at  Newcastle  and  per Cent  on the Ships which carry them  What these Four Articles wou'd pay to the  Exchequer  yearly 'twou'd be very difficult to calculate and I am too near the End of this Book to attempt it But I believe no Tax ever given since this War has come near it  'Tis true out of this the Publick wou'd be to pay HalfPay to the Seamen who shall be out of Employ and all the Losses and Damages on Goods and Ships which tho' it might be considerable wou'd be small compar'd to the Payment aforesaid for as the  Premio  of  per Cent  is but small so the Safety lies upon all men being bound to Insure For I believe any one will grant me this 'tis not the smallness of a Premio Ruins the Ensurer but 'tis the smallness of the Quantity he Insures and I am not at all asham'd to affirm That let but a Premio of  l per Cent  be paid into one Man's hand for all Goods Imported and Exported and any Man may be the General Ensurer of the Kingdom and yet that Premio can never hurt the Merchant neither  So that the vast Revenue this wou'd raise wou'd be felt no where neither  Poor nor Rich wou'd Pay the more for Coals Foreign Goods wou'd be brought home cheaper and our own Goods carri'd to Market cheaper Owners wou'd get more by Ships Merchants by Goods and Losses by Sea wou'd be no Loss at all to any Body because Repaid by the Publick Stock  Another unseen Advantage wou'd arise by it we shou'd be able to outwork all our Neighbours even the  Dutch  themselves by Sailing as cheap and carrying Goods as cheap in a time of War as in Peace an Advantage which has more in it than is easily thought of and wou'd have a noble influence upon all our Foreign Trade For what cou'd the  Dutch  do in Trade if we cou'd carry our Goods to  Cadiz  at  s per Ton  Freight and they give or  l  and the like in other Places Whereby we cou'd  be able to Sell cheaper or get more thau our Neighbours  There are several considerable clauses might be added to this Proposal some of great advantage to the General Trade of the Kingdom some to particular Trades and more to the Publick but I avoid being too Particular in things which are but the Product of my own private Opinion  If the Government shou'd ever proceed to the Experiment no question but much more than has been hinted at wou'd appear nor do I see any great difficulty in the Attempt or who wou'd be aggriev'd at it and there I leave it rather wishing than expecting to see it undertaken  The Conclusion  UPon a Review of the several Chapters of this Book I find that instead of being able to go further some things may have suffer'd for want of being fully express'd which if any person object against I only say I cannot now avoid it I have endeavour'd to keep to my Title and offer'd but at an  Essay  which any one is at liberty to go on with as they please for I can promise no Supplement As to Errors of Opinion tho' I am not yet convinc'd of any yet I no where pretend to Infallibility However I do not willingly assert any thing which I have not good Grounds for If I am mistaken let him that finds the Error inform the World better and never trouble himself to animadvert upon this since I assure him I shall not enter into any Pen and Ink Contest on the matter  As to Objections which may lye against any of the Proposals made in this Book I have in some places mention'd such as occurr'd to my Thoughts I shall never assume that Arrogance to pretend no other or further  Objections may be rais'd but I do really believe no such Objection can be rais'd as will overthrow any Scheme here laid down so as to render the thing impracticable Neither do I think but that all men will acknowledge most of the Proposals in this Book would be of as great and perhaps greater Advantage to the Publick than I have pretended to  As for such who read Books only to find out the Author's  faux Pas  who will quarrel at the Meanness of Stile Errors of Pointing Dulness of Expression or the like I have but little to say to them I thought I had corrected it very carefully and yet some Mispointings and small Errors have slipt me which 'tis too late to help As to Language I have been rather careful to make it speak  English  suitable to the Manner of the Story than to dress it up with Exactness of Stile chusing rather to have it Free and Familiar according to the Nature of  Essays  than to strain at a Perfection of Language which I rather wish for than pretend to be Master of  FINIS  ERRATA  INtroduction Page Line for  Elodgments  read  Lodgments  Page Line put the  Comma  between  probable  and  so  Page
