 A DAY IN TURKEY OR THE RUSSIAN SLAVES  A COMEDY AS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENT GARDEN  BY MRS COWLEY  THE SECOND EDITION  LONDON PRINTED FOR G G J AND J ROBINSON IN PATERNOSTERROW MDCCXCII  ADVERTISEMENT  HINTS have been thrown out and the idea industriously circulated that the following comedy is tainted with POLITICS I protest I know nothing about politicswill Miss Wolstonecraft forgive mewhose book contains such a body of mind as I hardly ever met withif I say that politics are  unfeminine  I never in my life could attend to their discussion  TRUE COMEDY has always been defined to be a picture of lifea record of passing mannersa mirror to reflect to succeeding times the characters and follies of the present How then could I pretending to be a comic poet bring an emigrant Frenchman before  the public at this day and not make him hint at the events which had just passed or were then passing in his native country A character so written would have been anomalousthe critics ought to have had no mercy on me It is A LA GREQUE who speaks not  I  nor can I be accountable for  his  sentiments  Such  is my idea of tracing CHARACTER and were I to continue to write for the stage I should always govern myself by it  THE illiberal and  false  suggestions concerning the politics of the comedy I could frankly forgive had they not deprived it of the honour of a COMMAND The passages on which those misrepresentations were built were on the second night omitted but immediately afterwards restored and the DAY IN TURKEY leaves the press exactly as it has continued to be performed amidst the most vivid and uninterrupted plauditsor interrupted only by the glitter of soft tears a species of applause not less flattering than the spontaneous laugh or the voluntary collision of hands  SOME of the performers in this comedy have play'd so transcendently well that their names deserve to be recorded but to particularise any when  all  have aim'd at perfection would be invidious  H COWLEY  Feb  PROLOGUE  SPOKEN BY MR HARLEY  NOT from the present moment springs our play  Th' events which gave it birth are past away  Five glowing moons have chas'd night's shades from earth  Since the war fled which gave our Drama birth  "  Not smiling peace o'er  RUSSIA's  widespread land  "  Wav'd gently  then  her sceptre of command    "  No thousands rush'd at red ambition's call  "  With mad'ning rage to triumphor to fall  "  'Twas then our female bard from  BRITAIN'S  shore  "  Was led by fancy to the distant roar  "  'Twas then she saw sweet virgins captives made  'Twas then she saw the cheek of beauty fade  Whilst the proud soldier in ignoble chains  Was from his country dragg'd to hostile plains  Thus was her bold imagination fired  When battle with its horrid train retired  Yet sure the story which she then combin'd  Should not to drear oblivion be resign'd  Nolet it still your various passions raise  And to have touch'd them oft' has been her praise  Trusting to candour she solicits here  Your smile of pleasure or your pity's tear  For tho' the  time  is past the FEELING true  She dedicates to NATURE and to YOU  NoteThe lines

Aye and if it hadn't been for some of our own soldiers I had been a lost manThey were so kind as to strip our cottage yesterday and left us no more than I can very  conveniently  move under  PAU  Yes and more than all that they took away my very best gown and my new fur cap    crying    yes and he who took them said it was in friendship for that otherwise my very best gown and cap would certainly fall into the hands of the enemy  SON  Yes it was truly a very friendly action and they perform'd it like gentlemenNo words but their very looks were oaths and the black eyebrows of one of them spoke louder curses than I ever heard between fifty Siberian boarhunters    clashing of swords without    Therethere d'ye hear Our friends are coming  down upon us and our enemies are at hand Come let us

my master  Enter  ORLOFF  surrounded by Turks    MULEY  Courageous Russian thou art ours Could valour have saved thee captivity and you had never met Your empress we trust has not many such soldiers in the neighbouring campCome droop not Sir this is the fortune of war  ORLOFF  Had I been made your prisoner whilst on a post of duty I could have borne my lotA soldier can support not only death but even slavery when a sense of duty gives  dignity  to his chains but  my  chains are base ones for I reconnoiter'd without command and have lost my liberty without glory  A LA GR  Then  I  have lost my liberty too without glory for I  attended  you without command and now Oh  le diable  I am valet de chambre to a slave  TURK  Let not that affect thee The fortune of war which has wounded your

powderpuff better than myselfI can frize you in a taste beyondOh what you are all CROPS I seefore fronts and back frontsOh those vile turbans my genius will be lost amongst you and a frizeur will be of no more use than an oysterwomanWhy you look as though you had all been scalp'd and cover'd your crowns with your pillows  TURK  Christian our turbans are too elevated a subject for your sport  A LA GR  Dear Sir    pointing to his turban and then to the ground    drop the subject it will be a proof of national taste  MULEY  Thy speech is licentious and empty but in a Frenchman we can pardon it'tis  national Taste  However if your boasted qualifications end here it is probable you will be a slave as little distinguish'd as your master  A LA GR  Pardonnez moi I can do things he never thought ofYou have heard the story of the basketmaker amongst savages I do not despair of seeing my master my servant yetCourage Monsieur Ie Compte I'll treat you with great condescension depend on't

engross'd the commodity  ORLOFF  Come Sir let us not loiter hereI would have my fate determined and my misery compleat Alas is it not already so Yes my heart has been long the property of sorrow and it will never relinquish its claims  MULEY  I shall lead you to the palace of the Bassa Ibrahimit is in the neighbourhood of yonder camp which he commands what your fate may then be his humour determines  A LA GR  Then I hope we shall catch him in a  good  humour and what care I whether a Turk or a Ruffian has the honor to be my master Now you see the misfortune of being born a Count Had he lost no more than I have he'd be as careless as I amCome brother slaveno ceremony no ceremony I beg  Exeunt  A LA GREQUE  pulls back his master and walks out before him    SCENE II ROCKS    Enter

manage her a little  MUS  You manage her Your ill humour towards her is never to be satisfiedYou are as malicious as you are highDon't I know how to manage an obstinate female as well as you  AZIM  Ha ha ha All the knowledge that nature cou'd contrive to pack into that little carcase of thine wou'd be insufficient for such a purposeManage an obstinate female The greatest generals in the world and the greatest tyrants have been foil'd at itLeave her to meI have discretionshe shall be kept on bread and water  MUS  Mark his discretion Keep a pretty woman on bread and water to make her contented and kind  AZIM  'Tis right I'll maintain it to her teethfor first she is a Russian and a bear  MUS  The beautiful Alexina a Russian bear Well secondly  AZIM  She is a christian and those christians

sorrows  AZIM  NonsenseSolitude and retirement  they  were made for birds of night owls may rejoice in them but women should seek daylight  ALEX  Daylight gives me no joy Through eleven weeks have I dragg'd on a torpid existenceSee    going to a tree    here is the sad register of my days of infelicity My bodkin on its tender rind hath mark'd the return of each  unhallow'd  SABBATHthe wounds now but just  discernible will deepen as the tree advances to maturity and speak in another age the miseries of Alexina    Takes up a folded paper from amongst the shrubs    A paperpoetry ah how descriptive of my own sensationswhich of my companions hath thus melodiously sung her sorrows    reads    I  a poor captive feel each day  That slowly creeps with leaden pace  Blest freedom here ne'er lends her ray  Her bright steps here we never trace  Oh that wild on some high mountain  I could catch the wand'ring winds  Or starting from some desart fountain  Emulate the bounding hinds  The clouds that swim in air's soft ocean  Seem to scorn my prison towers  Zephyr's light unfetter'd motion  Deeper heavier makes my hours  AZIM    snatching the paper from her hand    Such a wailing about freedom and liberty why the christians in one of the northern islands have established a slavetrade and proved by act of parliament that freedom is no blessing at all  MUS  No no they have only proved that it does not suit dark complexions To such a pretty creature as this they'd think it a blessing to  give  every freedom and  take  every freedom  AZIM  Come come be gay and happy like the rest of the slaves How stands your mind today towards a  handsome Bassa Our master is returning from the campThe cessation of hostilities will give him a short leisure which he will certainly devote to

successPress fearlessly the cause of virtue and glow with the sainted subject  Thus tho' a slave thy soul's high state  Shall prove its origin divine  Soar far above thy wretched fate  And o'er thy chains sublimely shine  Exit  MUS  Why as to chastity and all that which you make an orthodox article of sweet one we Turks are a sort of dissentersa woman's virtue with us is to CHARM and her religion should be LOVEAh ah here comes Ibrahim and his whole haram  His  creed is love and there is not a more orthodox man in the country  Enter  LAURETTA  and  FATIMA    hastily    LAUR  Ah Mustapha the Bassa is arrived full of triumph full of wishes panting to behold Alexina What will become of her Where is she  MUS  She just now run off on that side and I shall run off on thisfor I

my wits to think how happy we shall be now the Bassa is come backwe shall have nothing but whim and entertainment  Have you been looking at the new pavilion today  LAUR  No  FAT  O dear it is almost finishedThe hangings are gold tissue and when our beautiful sofa which we have been making for him is set up and the Bassa sees it all together he will be transportedDo you not think so Hark here he comes with all the ensigns of war at his heelsO no  they  come first I protestI'll stand here and take a view of the whole    A march is play'd Standard bearers advance first they are followed by

trumpet and the flute  And lost the soft melodious lute  When Ibrahim thy praise they wou'd display  Sunk in the lofty theme  As twilight yields to day  IBRA  Enough of praise and of triumph A sweeter triumph than your songs can bestow awaits meWhere is the lovely Russian who tho' my captive more than two moons I have not yet beheld  AZIM  We rejoice in our lord's return that her pride may be humbledThe insolence of her carriage and the perverseness of her temper are intolerable  IBRA  Thou hast seen her Muley does she justify Azim's description  MULEY  She is reserved my lord reserved and melancholybut she is too gentle to be insolent  AZIM  Muley knows her notCanst thou believe it mighty Bassa the idea of surrend'ring her charms to thee and of being raised to the honour of thy notice

loveIf you can contrive to do that you will be the most astonishing  Bashaw  in all Turkey  IBRA  How then  LAUR  Grandeur and dignity to inspire love Ha ha ha they may inspire your pretty captive with veneration and respectbut veneration and respect is an atmosphere so cold that love starves in it  IBRA  What then must I do to touch her heart with love  LAUR  Affect humility not greatness You must become a suppliant before you can hope to be a victor  IBRA  Dost thou speak truth my pretty Italian Thy country is the country of love and thou should'st be an adept in the science  LAUR  Yes I know the history of the heart and do assure you that you must become the slave of your captive if you ever mean to taste the sublime excesses of a mutual passion  AZIM    contemptuously    Mutual passion Sir she is your slave  command  her Such baseness may befit an Italian but a mussulman is more sensible to his dignity  IBRA  I will hear you both further on the subject The iron labour of the war is for a few weeks suspended and during that cessation Pleasure I am thine Prepare your banquets compose new delights let every hour teem with fresh invented joys till I forget the toils of the sanguinary field and bathe my wounds with rosyfinger'd love  Exit with part of his train  FAT  Well he's in delightful spiritsBut how strange it is that the Russian slave shou'd not have presented herself to welcome her master and to give him an impression of her charms  LAUR  Stranger if she had when nothing frightens her so much as the idea of inspiring him with a passion I am interested for her and it is for this reason I shall endeavour to make Ibrahim pursue a conduct not usual from a mighty mussulman to his slave  Exit  FAT  Hark ye Azim What makes your lovely countenance look so grim when we are all so gay I declare your glum face suits the day as little as a black patch upon a gold robeChange it man change it  and don't be afraid of losing any thing by it for you must look carefully to pick up a worse  Exit  MULEY  Azim since I saw thee last I have trod the paths of gloryI have slumbered amidst the frosts of the night I have toil'd amidst the streams of burning day but I return and find thee the sameWith me all things have chang'd but thou art unalter'd Thy temper like the deep shadow of the forest is sometimes chequer'd by the dart of the angry lightning but the serene cheerfulness of the morning dwells not with thee  AZIM  Well and what then If you like me not thwart me not There's room enough in Turkey for thee and for meLet the crow and the vulture rest on the same tree but may thou and I live as far apart as the streams of Ilyssus and the waters of the Bosphorus  SELIM  Surely thy evil disposition must be a scourge to thy soulit must be affliction to thee  SONG SELIM  Ah teach thy breast soft pity's throb  And harmonize thy rugged mind  Ah teach thy lid soft pity's tear  That gem of sentiment refined  Could'st thou once know the tender bliss  The sympathizing bosom knows  When at meek sorrow's sacred touch  Responsive sadness round it flows  No more thy brow wou'd wear that frown  Thy glance no more so sternly dart  But joys would glitter in thy eye  And peace cling gladly to thy heart  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE  An Apartment in the  BASSA  's Palace    IBRAHIM  discovered seated under a Canopy Officers and Slaves

topsey turvey there  IBRA  Did you find them equally dull in other respects  A LA GR  Yes Finding they would not learn liberty I would have taught them dancing but they seem'd as incapable of one blessing as the other so now  I  am led a dance by this gentleman    turning to his master    into your chains in which if I can but dance  myself into your favour I shall think it the best  step  I

Should lab'ring honest lowfed Dick  In spite of starving very sick  To doctor send  By some kind friend  To  beg  advice  He strait will see  No hope of fee  And ten to one he answersNo  A senator you ask'd to vote  The dear red book he knows by rote  His country's good  He understood  You had in view  But shou'd he find  No place design'd  His bow  polite  you know meansNo  To a young beauty wou'd you kneel  And talk of all the pangs you feel  With eye askance  She'll steal a glance  And blushing sigh  But shou'd you press  Her power to bless  She'll whisper forth a  trembling  No  TURK  I like your song  A LA GR  I like your praise  TURK  And to reward ye I'll shew ye a place where by the help of loose bricks and good climbing I sometimes get a squint at the girlsthough if it  was known I
