 THE HISTORY OF LADY BARTON  VOL I  THE HISTORY OF LADY BARTON A NOVEL IN LETTERS  BY MRS GRIFFITH  IN THREE VOLUMES  VOL I  Quibus pretium faceret ipsa fragilitas  PLIN de Crystallo  LONDON Printed for T DAVIES in Russelstreet Coventgarden and T CADELL in the Strand MDCCLXXI  PREFACE  WORKS of this kind are in general of so captivating a nature to young readers that let them run through but a few pages of almost any Novel and they will feel their affections or curiosity so interested either in the characters or the events that it is with difficulty they can be diverted to any other study or  amusement till they have got to the end of the story  From the experience then of this species of attraction such sort of writings may be rendered by good and ingenious authors extremely serviceable to morals and other useful purposes of lifePlace the magnet low and it will degrade our sentiments hold it high and it elevates them Imitation is natural to the human mind and as we copy those patterns best which we are most conversant with it depends upon the choice that  parents and preceptors make of such compositions to produce the best effect from this general sympathy  Tell me your company  is a just adage but  tell me your studies  is as true a maxim  In the selection of proper pieces to assist toward so pleasing a method of instruction no inconsiderable part of the attention ought to be paid to the stile and language of the writers for it is certain that those who can best express their sentiments are those who conceive them best and the same idea delivered by a gentleman  will have double the effect to what it would have if uttered by his valet de chambre  All authors therefore of mean or illiberal education or stationed below the familiar converse of polite life should be wholly excluded from the sort of library I am here recommending Nor should any translations be admitted there though  done from the originals by the best hands  according to the phrase of their title pagesFor there is a stiffness in the stile of all the publications of this kind I have  ever met with that constrains the ease and freedom of our language and impures it with a number of Gallicisms Italianisms c which even those who are allowed to be  the best hands  that have ever condescended to so servile an office find it impossible to avoid A work framed from one's own ideas is like learning to write from  a copy  a translation is like  tracing  the letters after the master has  penciled  them for us  If I have had any success in this or my former work of the same  kind  The Delicate Distress  it is owing more to accident than genius and may therefore be deemed rather fortunate than meritorious I have had a good deal of acquaintance with the world and have known many private memoirs and particular circumstances in life which has afforded me an opportunity of supplying both my characters and situations from the living drama instead of borrowing them from the mimic scene I felt as I wrote  and lived along the line  from the sympathy of friendship or the tenderness  of compassion This is contagiousI hope my readers may catch the infection also  For I shall think myself extremely happy if I can in any degree contribute towards forming or informing the young and innocent the task of reforming I leave to greater geniuses and abler pens The characters which present themselves in this work are as I have already hinted mostly drawn from real life they are therefore natural and proper objects either for imitation or avoidance  " Virtuous and vicious every man must be  " Few in th' extreme but all in the degree"  But when writers exceed the bounds of probability and describe an angel or a devil in human form our reason is shocked and revolts at the idea of a character so much above or below our nature the semblance of truth vanishes the reader's attention becomes relaxed and both the events and the moral if there should be any  " Fade like the baseless fabric of a vision  " Nor leave a wreck behind"  With such productions our circulating libraries those  slopshops  in literature abound and with them must they still be filled till our legislature shall think proper to enable the booksellers to pay for better works by passing an act to secure their property in the copies they purchase till that is done no person in the trade can afford to pay a large sum for any manuscript be the merit of it what it will and of course no authors except the very poor ones indeed both in the literal and metaphorical sense of the word or the rich who form but a small squadron in the host of writers  will devote their time and labour to the public without hope of some adequate reward  Those who amongst our legions neither want nor abound have therefore but one way of contributing their mite to the Parnassian treasury that of publishing by subscription which in my estimation is at once both flattering and humiliating as it proves the attachment of our friends while it lays us under the painful necessity of taxing their regard  Happy and honoured as I have been by the favour of the public in general as well as by the kind partiality of my particular friends I shall ever be both proud and pleased to offer my present and future efforts to their indulgent candor upon any terms and to subscribe myself their  much obliged most grateful and obedient servant E G  ERRATA VOL I  Preface Page xii line last but  for  wreck  r  rack  Novel P l r  grand  P l dele last  and  P d par continue the quotation marks to the end P L

melancholy slow  " Where mountains rise and where rude waters flow  " Where e'er I go whatever realms I see  " My heart untravelled fondly turns to thee  " Still to my Fanny turns with ceaseless pain  " And drags at each remove a lengthening chain"  HOW much am I indebted to the author of these beautiful lines for having expressed my present feelings so much better than I could myself The address was originally made to a brother there can therefore be no impropriety  in applying them to a sisterand such a one as mine  You desired me my Fanny to write to you from every stagethis is the first moment I have had to myselfone of Sir William's most favourite maxims is that women should be treated like state criminals and utterly debarred the use of pen and inkhe says that  "those who are fond of scribling are never good for any thing else that female friendship is a jest and that we only correspond or converse with our own sex for the sake of indulging ourselves in talking of the other"  Why Sir William why will you discover such illiberal sentiments to one who has been so lately prevailed upon to  pronounce those awful words  "love honor and obey"  The fulfilling the two first articles of this solemn engagement must depend upon yourself the latter only rests on me and I will most sanctimoniously perform my part of the covenant  Yes my sister I will stifle the rising sigh and wipe away the wayward tear that steals involuntarily down my cheek from the fond recollection of those dear friends that I have left behind me Would to nature that the objects necessarily followed their affections or else retained them with themselves instead of suffering remembrance like a tyrant to pursue the unhappy traveller adding anxiety to fatigue and grief to danger  Sir William has met with some gentlemen of his acquaintance here he presented them to me and I could see that he seemed pleased at that sort of approbation which is expressed by looks at first sight of a person who happens to please usthere would be something flattering in this idea which I should wish to cherish if I did not fear that his pleasure arose more from vanity than affectionYet why should I think so Has he not pursued me with unabated ardour near two years and triumphed over the repeated refusals of my friends and self by the most obstinate perseverance But might not vanitybe still thou restless busy perturbed spirit and no longer seek to investigate an humiliating cause for an event which is irrevocably past  These gentlemen then that I told you of are to join company with us for the remainder of our journey and voyagethere is one of them a Lord something I forgot his title who is just returned from making the  grande tour  his person is elegant I think him both in face and figure vastly like Colonel StanfordI suppose this young nobleman will be the  bon ton  of this winter in Dublin it may therefore be of some use to a stranger as I shall be to be known to him I shall not however cultivate the present opportunity as I have left the room determined not to return on pretence of a headach in order to tell my dear Fanny what she already knows that I am her more than sister her affectionate and faithful friend  LOUISA BARTON  PS Love to my brother and to my dear Mary Granville but I charge you not to shew my letters even to either of them  LETTER II  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  Holyhead  WILL you not doubt my veracity Fanny when I tell you that three days spent in this dullest and most disagreeable of villages have not appeared tedious to me There is certainly a wonderful charm in variety of situationsevery change produces a new assemblage of ideas and actuates the mind with curiosity comparison and inquiry  The wildness or even horror of this place for we have had a perpetual storm is so strongly contrasted with the mild scenes of Cleveland Hall or indeed any other part of England that I have seen that one would scarce think it possible for a few days journey to transport us into such extremes of the sublime and beautiful  I am persuaded that all the inhabitants of Wales must be romanticthere never was any place appeared so like enchanted ground and the scenes shift upon you almost as quick as in a pantomimefrom the stupendous bleak and barren hills of Cambria you are almost instantly transported into fertile and laughing valliesThere never was a richer and more beautiful view than  that of the Vale of CluydI am not at at all surprised that poetry took its rise in this part of Britain the ancient Druids could not be at a loss for poetic imagesevery object they saw must have inspired them and exceeded both in beauty and wildness whatever sportive fancy could have invented or creative genius drawn forth from the storehouse of imagination  I think that even I seem to be possessed with a kind of poetic rapture while I describe these charming scenes but I will not anticipate the pleasure that I hope you will yourself receive from them next summer tho' I already forestall the much higher delight I shall feel on seeing my dear Fanny at Southfield  Sir William has been in great spirits ever since we have been here and highly pleased at a very trifling mark of my  obedience  he proposed riding out the morning after we came and though there was a high wind and a drizzling rain I made not the least objection to mounting one of the little Welsh palfreys and clambering up the hills at his requestour fellow travellers Lord Lucan and Colonel Walter accompanied us  I have described the former to youthe latter is remarkably handsome but with a peculiar expression in his countenance which is not the result of his features but seems to arise from the predominancy of a particular passion in his mindin short it is that sort of expression  which has made you and me dislike so many handsome men  The Colonel is to be our neighbour in the country he is now going to Ireland to take possession of his estate and a seat in parliament for a borough he never sawI am no politician or I should animadvert a little upon this subject This selfsame Colonel has just tapped at my door to tell me that the wind veers a little and that Sir William desires I will hold myself in readiness to embark I  obey  adieu my Fanny  LOUISA BARTON  PS I forgot to tell you that Lord Lucan was at Paris when we were there last yearhe has made me smile two or  three times by his pathetic manner of lamenting his not knowing me then I tell him that he may date his acquaintance from what aera he pleases as our living together in an inn has brought on a greater intimacy in four days than almost as many years could have effected in the usual course of meeting at Operas Routes c But he sighs out a rueful  O que non  and the Colonel laughs to shew his white teeth and superior understanding  I come Sir William adieu adieu  LETTER III  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  Dublin  WHAT scenes of distress have I gone thro' since I concluded my last letter to my dear Fanny We embarked aboard the pacquetboat with what they called a shifting gale and to do the captain justice he was unwilling to sail But Sir William and Colonel Walter were both impatient and their impetuosity as it generally does triumphed over our calmer reason  We had not been three hours at sea before there arose so violent a storm that the captain said it was impossible for the ship to weather it six hours he was however mistaken for it continued six  and thirtyduring which time we had been driven upon the northern coast of Ireland and it was then to be feared that we should beat to pieces on the rocks There was a great number of passengers on board and their groans and lamentations would have affected me extremely in any other situation but the violent and continued sickness which I suffered rendered me insensible even to my own danger nor did I feel the smallest emotion when Lord Lucan who had seldom left my bedside caught hold of my hand with a degree of wildness and pressing it to his lips said  "We must perishbut we shall die together"  The Captain had fired guns of distress upon our approaching the shore and a fishing boat came to our relief into  which the passengers crouded so fast that the gentlemen were obliged to draw their swords to prevent their sinking it How I got into the boat I know not but I found myself there rolled up in Lord Lucan's rocquelaure and my head supported by Sir William's kneethere were two other ladies in the boat with us the youngest of whom a Miss Leister seemed to be if possible worse than Ibut I will not detain you longer in this scene of horror where we expected to be swallowed up by the waves that came rolling on us like moving mountains every moment till we reached the shore  Behold us then landed upon what may almost be called a desert island for it is entirely surrounded by an arm  of the sea and uninhabited by every thing but a few goats and some fishermen who are almost as wild as theyIt was about four o' clock in the morning when we arrived at this dismal place and such a morning for darkness rain and wind I never saw  Neither Miss Leister nor I could stand much less walk and the gentlemen were obliged to carry us in their arms by turns for near two milestill we arrived at some of the huts where the hospitable cottagers received us with that sort of surprize which I imagine we should feel if an order of higher beings were to descend by miracle to visit usBut be their kindness never forgot by me and may their beds of straw and smoaky rafters yield them  such soft and balmy sleep as they afforded to my harrassed frame and let them never envy those that toss on down  I did not wake till near ten in the morning which was then as mild as it had been tempestuous when I retired to rest Lord Lucan and Miss Leister were seated on a little bank withoutside the door of the cottage where I slept to prevent any person from disturbing me as soon as they heard me move Miss Leister came to offer her assistance in dressing meshe smiling said that breakfast was prepared for me in a large drawingroom and under the finest canopy she had ever seen then led me by the hand to the bank where she had been sittingI was surprized to see tea there which tho' made in wooden  vessels appeared to me more delicious than any that I had ever drank out of the finest Dresden china  Lord Lucan told me that Sir William the rest of the gentlemen and Mrs Layton who is Miss Leister's aunt were gone to  reconnoitre la carte du paï de la terre inconnuë ou nons etions  and that now he had seen me so happily recovered he wou'd try to join them  I found that another boat had arrived from the ship and that our servants and a part of our baggage were comewhen my poor Benson saw me she cried for joy and indeed nothing but the state of insensibility in which I quitted the vessel could have made me leave her behind  Upon enquiring we were told that there were neither horses or carriages of any kind to be had to convey us out of the island but that we might cross in a boat to a piece of land that lay opposite to one side of it which when we reached was eight miles from any town or village As soon as I had changed my cloaths Miss Leister and I set out to meet or overtake our company to confer about the difficulties of our sad situation  I will bring you acquainted with Miss Leisler in my next letter and for the present I will call her Lucy for I am sure I shall love her and in that case I hate the formality of Miss  Suppose us now to have walked about a mile and a half without discovering  any object but the sea which surrounded us when to our great delight we spied land tho' still divided from us by a gulph we thought impassable We stood however on the shore inventing a thousand impracticable schemes to cross this tremendous Hellespont but never once thought of the only possible one tho' we had been told of it We at last grew weary of indulging our visions and Lucy who I find is extremely romantic said that were she in my situation she could with the utmost pleasure think of passing her days on the spot we were thrown on for that the constant presence of  the  beloved object must render any place an Eden to herI told her that if we were fated to remain there that either Lord Lucan or Colonel Walter would I hoped make this spot  a paradise to her on her own plan She wiped away a starting tear and said that was impossible  At that instant a new object roused our attention we perceived a gentleman well mounted and attended by a couple of servants on the opposite shore Lucy put up a most fervent ejaculation that he might have knighterrantry enough to cross the river and rescue us from our melancholy situation her prayer was heardhe swam his horse across the flood and Lucy called him a second Leander He came up to us with infinite politeness and address and told us that the mail which had been put on shore with us had been forwarded to his father who was the next justice of peace and lived about twelve miles from  thence that by that means he became acquainted with our distress and had sent his carriage as far as the roads were passable with a number of saddle horses to bring us to his house  I confess I was charmed with this instance of hospitality and generosity I hope I should have been as much pleased with it had I only heard it related without having benefited by itThere is nothing affects my heart so much as benevolent actions I will flatter myself that this is owing to a natural sympathyWe made all the acknowledgments that our joy would permit and walked or rather ran back to our cottage with the stranger where we met our company and many more of the passengers who had come in the second boat from the ship  Mr Mathewes's servants were by this time come up to us and opened two large baskets of provisions cold meats wine tea c Every person seemed surprised and overjoyed while universal gladness diffused itself through our little colonyLucy appeared almost frantic with delightthe common occurrences of life appear like enchantment to some mindsbut there was an elegant simplicity mingled with her transports that rendered them extremely pleasing  I have now my dearest Fanny delivered you from the painful anxiety you must have suffered from the first part of my letter my next I hope shall transport you to more pleasing scenes In the mean time rest assured that thro' every  change of circumstance or situation I shall remain unalterably yours  L BARTON  I long to hear from you pray tell me have you heard from the continent and how and where Lord Hume now is  LETTER IV  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  FOR the present I will continue my letters journalwise as Miss Byron  Sir Charles Grandison  calls it but I cannot for my life be circumstantial and carry you up and down stairs to the parlour the drawingroom the harpsicord the cardtable c c c  Suppose us then to have crossed the so much dreaded arm of the sea with some difficulty and less danger that we have performed our twelve miles journey thro' rugged roads and over hills and dales and are at last safely arrived at Mr Mathewes's very handsome seat welcomed by him and his lady and a very numerous family of sons and daughters grown up to men and women's estate  On our entrance we were shewn into a room where there was a table laid with all kinds of breakfasts that could be pleasing or necessary to the sick or healthful appetite and were informed that there were beds prepared for any of the company who might require rest after their fatigue This offer was declined by us all for the present but the  whole company which amounted to eighteen ladies and gentlemen besides servants accepted Mr Mathewes's invitation to spend that day and night at his house except Colonel Walter who said he would go on to Newry the next great town and send us carriages from thence  From the first notion that you could conceive of our generous hosts you must believe that we were politely and elegantly entertained but neither your idea nor my description can do justice to their hospitality they have given me the most favourable impressions of this country on my first entering it but even Sir William who is partial to his native land says I am not to expect a whole nation of suchfools I think he said  heigh ho this is my only comment  The manners and behaviour of this worthy and amiable family were expressive of the sincerest pleasure at having had it in their power to relieve our distressmay they or their's never know any Lucy was in raptures with the young ladies both she and I flatter ourselves with a prospect of much pleasure from a future intimacy with Mrs Mathewes and her daughters  Next morning our carriages a coach and four and several postchaises arrived and we took a grateful and affectionate leave of our kind hosts Our journey had nothing remarkable in it except Colonel Walter's waiting for us at the  first stage we came to which considering the hurry he affected when he left us was rather an overstrained piece of politeness arising I imagine from a supposition that his company was of some consequence to the party  And perhaps he is not mistakenLucy's aunt Mrs Layton a good agreeable and well jointured relict about six and thirty seems to admire him muchshe speaks Italian badlyhe is master of the language and she is for ever applying to him to correct her pronounciationwho knows but he may find pleasure in instructing so hopeful a pupil  The Colonel is what is called a woman's man he has lived a good deal  abroad and has a superficial knowledge of almost every sciencehis head may be aptly enough compared to the drawer of a lady's writing cable which contains a little of every thingI have this moment looked into mine to see if the allusion is just Its contents are a miniature picture of Sir William with a slight crack in the enamel and the catch that fastens the bracelet brokenmy housekeeper's accountsa little billet from Lucya French song that the Colonel gave mesome scented sealing waxwriting papermessage cardsand a pocket book with scissars penknife pencil blank leaves cI do really think that this farrago of materials conveys a very expressive image of what I would describeI hope you will think so too and henceforward acknowlege the Colonel as an acquaintance  I promised in my last to give you a sketch of my Lucy but I find I am not equal to the task for even in her outward appearance there is a variability that renders it almost impossible to draw an exact resemblance of her at some times you would think that her form and face were designed to personify Vivacity  " Dip in the rainbow trick her off in air"  At other times a soft melancholy usurps the place of gaiety so that at different aeras she may pass alternately for a  Melpomene  or a  Thalia  The Muses of Tragedy and Comedy  yet she is agreeable under both these characters and I by no means think her temper changeable but am rather inclined tho' sorry to believe that these transitions are  rather the effect of peculiar circumstances than natural constitution  I know she is in lovebut I should suppose that to be rather a consistent passion where the flame is mutual and I should be tempted almost to despise her or any other woman in the world who continued still to love without sympathyfor true love is a passion of that extraordinary nature as some author has well expressed it  that it requires the felicity of two persons to render one happy  Without being positively handsome the men all like her she has good eyes hair and teeth a lively tho' not a fine complexion and a form that may justly be stiled elegant tho' small  And now my dear Fanny let me speak of and to yourself It is above  a month since I left London I have been a fortnight in Dublin and have not received a single line from you or any of the other dear friends I parted from in DoverstreetThey tell me something about contrary windsfor my own peace I will believe them but if I am to remain in this island much longer under such suspence I shall be tempted to sell my jewels and send the money to Lapland to purchase I know not whether it is to be an easterly or a westerly windbut it shall be a fair gale to waft your letters to mefor the story of Aeolus and Ulysses you know is quite an arrant fiction  Your impatient but truly affectionate LOUISA BARTON  LETTER V  Miss CLEVELAND to Lady BARTON  Doverstreet  I Received my dear sister's two letters from Wales together and am pleased to find that you illustrate your own remark on the good effects which change of objects produce upon our minds I have always thought that in the separation of two persons who love each other the one who is left is by far the greatest sufferer The mind in spite of us must necessarily in some degree accompany or rather attend upon the body and while that is in motion it feels a kind of rotation also  " Beaux banish beaux and coaches coaches drive"  And now I talk of coaches I have never  set my foot in ours since you left London I begin to think that this is carrying the idea of locality too far and will therefore order it to set me down at the playhouse this evening  Your description of SouthBritain has encreased my curiosity but not my desire of travelling through itfor what can augment my wishes to see you Your first letter affected me extremelyOh beware of a propensity to unhappiness my much loved sister Sir William has a roughness in his manner which I really believe to be more owing to an illiberal education than a coarse mindI say  illiberal  tho' I know he was bred at a collegelearning and science may be there acquired but alas I fear the professors of universities do not attend  much to  les petites morales  There are many men weak enough to imagine that an affectation of contempt for the understandings of women is proof sufficient of the superiority of their ownbut these persons ought never to marry for we can neither love those we despise nor those who seem to despise usBut I am far from imagining this to be Sir William's case I know he both loves and esteems my Louisa though he be deficient in that sort of galant address which might better inable him to shew his sentimentsBut how few husbands are there after all even in what is stiled polite life who seem to think such an attention necessary I affirm it to be absolutely sofor they must be sad philosophers indeed who mistake the  possession  of a treasure for the  enjoyment  of it but I will not  forgive your trifling with your own happiness by seeming to doubt a fact on which alone it can be founded  I am glad you have happened to meet with the gentlemen you mentionAgreeable society is always pleasing to a rational mind but more particularly so when there is any little difficulty danger or fatigue to encounter and notwithing your flourishing description of Wales I cannot help thinking that a journey thro' it must be attended in some degree with those slight evils I have mentioned  My brother has been remarkably grave ever since you left us but I will not flatter you by imputing his reserve intirely to your absencehis Delia his beloved Miss Colville is going to France  with her ridiculous motherand ill used as my sensible brother has been by that absurd widow I have no doubt but he will be weak enough to follow her daughter there and leave poor solitary me to pass the winter  tout seul  in Doverstreet  I have told him and I really believe it that Mrs Colville has no exception either to his person rank or fortune tho' she will never consent to his marrying her daughter but I am persuaded that she would most readily accept of him herselfSir George cannot help smiling when I talk in this strain tho' he affects to be displeased at what he calls my folly  I know you will expect that I should say something of myselfAlas Louisa  my history like poor  Viola  's  Twelfth Night  is a blank I have not received a line from Lord Hume since I saw you my apprehensions for his health and safety are however relieved by a letter his sister had from him dated at Sienna a few days ago  I will believe for his sake as well as my own that he has written to mea letter may miscarry I have often heard that the posts upon the continent are not so regular as oursI will believe any thing butthat he has forgotten meIs this philosophy or vanity and is my opinion of his constancy founded on his merits or my own I ask questions without wishing to have them resolved  Adieu my only confidante my much loved sister  adieu  F CLEVELAND  PS Sir George's best affections along with mine wait on Sir William and our dear Louisa Mary Granville is at Bath with her aunt  LETTER VI  Miss CLEVELAND to Lady BARTON  London  WHY surely my dear Louisa you intend to publish your travels and to push Madame de Scuderi from the shelf she has so long usurped in a lady  libraryWhat a sweet romance is yours what  hairbreadth 'scapes  what amazing perils by sea and by land what imminent danger of passing your life on  a desolate island which by the way would I fear had you remained there have become a  dissolute  one for I don't find that you had a parson among ye and I have doubts whether the colonel and the widow would have waited till another shipwreck might have sent you a Jonasas to Lucy and Lord Lucan to be sure they would have remained in a state of perfect purity and Sir William and you are already joined in the holy bands of matrimonySo that upon a fair calculation I do not think that your community would have been worse than the rest of this habitable globe for one couple of delinquents in three is as little as can be expected even in the island of saints  Ireland So stiled by the antients  of which you are happily now become an inhabitant or in the territories  of his holiness the pope where all should be perfect  But a truce with Badinage and be assured my dear sister that I felt for your distresses and sincerely rejoice at your safe arrival in Dublin I both love and admire tho' not without a little mixture of envy your generous hosts What extreme pleasure must they have received from such a noble exercise of their benevolence and hospitality  All girls build castles mine have been always situated on a seacoast and in them have I often received shipwrecked princesses and drowning heroes I have chafed their temples and rubbed their hands for whole hours and when my great care and humanity have brought  them back to this world of woes they have repaid my pains by a faithful recital of their doleful adventuresI once fell in love with a man I never saw for the same sentiment  Triumvirate chap xciii  I did not then imagine I should ever have so near and dear a connection as my Louisa involved in the reality of such a dreadful situation and now may heaven be praised for my loved sister's preservation  I like your description of the Colonel muchone knows abundance of  table drawers  tho' not all as well furnished as yoursbut I do not much like the charactersmatterers in science are generally triflers in every thingthat same want of stability which prevents their being master of any art like a shake in  marble runs thro' the whole block and lessens the value of every partI should not like such a man either as a friend or lover tho' he may perhaps be an agreeable acquaintance  I am much more charmed with your Lucy your little pocket Iris I hope she always wears changeable silks and alters them from grave to gay according to the complexion of the dayI did not mean to rhyme as you may see by my mode of writingI agree with you that those transitions you mention may possibly be owing rather to particular circumstances than a peculiar inconsistency of mindthe latter would render her contemptible the former entitles her to our tenderness and love I think even from the slight account you  have given of her there must be a charming frankness in her manner which is one of the first qualities I would seek for in a friend Life is not long enough but were I an antediluvian I should not think it worth while to seek for a heart that is wrapped up in a hundred and fifty envelopes  Un coeur serré  would disgust me tho' the possessor of it had ten thousand amiable qualities  I think that your misfortunes with regard to the storm like most other disasters have been productive of some good by bringing you acquainted with Miss LeisterBut what have you done with Lord Lucan when the pencil and pallet were in your hands why lay them by without giving a sketch of him I should fancy from his rueful  O que non  that there were traits of character sufficient to mark him byif so I desire you will resume your new calling and let me have a full length of his lordship by the next post  Sir George as I guessed actually intends to set out for Paris in a fortnightI am strongly tempted to accompany him LouisaI should then be on the same continent nay perhaps in the same city with Lord Hume for as his route is not absolutely determined I think it is most likely that he will pass the winter in Paris as I know it is his favourite cityBut thenmay not my delicacy be wounded by its being said or even thought that I pursued him thither and to what end if his heart as I much fear be already estranged  will my presence recal it ah no to what then should I expose myself to be slighted by the man I loveO never never in woods and deserts let me rather dwell and hide my woes in solitude  I now wish I had gone with you to Irelandand yet I should not chuse to be farther removed from that blessed spot where ere it be for at present I know not that holds my happinessperhaps my misery How can you say Louisa that love is a consistent passion alas you know it not ten thousand contradictory wishes are born and perish in my mind in the same momentand yet there was a time when you my sister used to blame my calmness and upbraid me with having too much philosophy  where is that calmness that philosophy fled to now Oh let me once more woo them to my breast and be what I then was your happy as well as affectionate sister  F CLEVELAND  PS You will perceive by this long epistle that I have received both your letters from DublinI do not my dear expect two for one but the first came last night when I happened to be out and the last arrived this morningYou may also perceive I began my letter with an affected  gayeté de coeur  and ended it in real sadnessI had determined not to mention Lord Hume but my brother's coming into my dressingroom and telling me of his going to Paris threw me off my guardexcuse my weakness my loved my dear Louisa  LETTER VII  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  Dublin  INdeed my dear Fanny your last letter has hurt me sensiblyI cannot express the tender concern I feel for your sufferingsyet with that frankness we both so much admire I will confess that I am on this occasion conscious of the force of Rochfaucault's selfish maxim  "In the distresses of our best friends we find something that does not displease us"  Horrid adage yet how true when I cannot help rejoicing that I have never felt the passion of Love in the extreme that you seem to doI have ever thought that love like friendship could only be founded on  the amiable qualities of its object and that with them it must because it ought decayHow often have you and I laughed at the persevering passion of Miss B when we knew that Lord M despised herBut the little tyrant has taken ample vengeance upon youHeaven shield me from his resentment  I am however far from doubting Lord Hume's constancy or love to my sweet Fanny and my opinion is founded on your charms rather than his meritsyet grant him to be all you can wish surely it is a miserable state to have our happiness so totally dependent upon any human being that our not hearing from them for a few days or weeks shall render us totally wretched and create such a fever in the mind as you  describe and I tremble at Heavens what a wretch should I be were I possessed of this tormenting passion I am certain Sir William has no more idea of it than of a sixth sensehow would the roughness and asperity of his manners which are now scarce sufferable then wound me to the heart  Rejoice with me my Fannyat what not at my want of sensibility for sure I think not even you have moreand can I be delighted then at not having found in Sir William an object to awaken it O no I fear I ought rather to lament than exult in my present torpid statebut still I have a subject for my tenderness my much loved dearest sister Come to me then my Fanny and I will soothe your sorrow will listen  to your soft complainings and share each pang that wounds your gentle heart  I was alarmed at the first part of your last letter your treating the distresses I went thro' ludicrously was not like my Fanny and when we stray so far out of ourselves there must be some particular cause which we would wish to conceal that occasions our acting or speaking out of characteryou were unhappy and did not wish that I should know it But let not even that sort of pious fraud be ever practised between us moreYou may write freely your letters are sacred no eye but my own will ever see them Sir William is satisfied with our correspondence and says he is sure we shall both be tired of it in three monthsI will venture to say he is mistaken in us both  And so my brother is a stricken deer also and is setting off on a wildgoose chace after Miss Colville surely two victims to love in one family are quite sufficient and don Cupid will I flatter myself let the third go free  " Fantastick tyrant of the am'rous heart  " How hard thy yoke how cruel is thy dart  " Those 'scape thy anger who refuse thy sway  " And those are punished most who most obey"  For heaven's sake Fanny if you have not by this time received a volume of  billet doux  from Lord Hume get up your spirits break at once into open rebellion against him and the little purblind deity fly to me and try whether an Hibernian swain cannot make you amends for his lossI am persuaded that it is possible to shake off an ill placed affection but I am afraid by saying so I may offend you however I shall  let the sentiment pass since 'tis written and you are welcome to make as free with it as you please and perhaps may say with the philosopher Boyle  "that to undertake the cure of a lover is perhaps the next weakness to that of being one"  I perceive myself falling into the very error which I reprehend in you that of affecting to treat your distresses lightly but believe me my Fanny that I lay a restraint on myself in doing so and feel them not the lessChearfulness and dissipation are the only remedies for a wounded mind and if I can make you smile even at my folly my end will be answered  You will I dare say discover that this letter has been written at different  aerasmorning visitors are a pest that rages in all cities but is I think more violent here than in any place I ever was in except BathThere is some excuse for this intemperate desire of gadding there as the use of the waters forbids all sedentaty amusements and a game of  Neighbour I'm come to torment you  may be conducive to healthbut here without temptation or excuse the ladies make it a rule to pass their mornings in any one's house but their own and would almost persuade one that they can neither read write work houswife or pray  Exclusive of this  grand mal  I like the people and country extremelythere is an air of freedom chearfulness and affability that runs thro' all the better  sort of men and women and inclines you to like them even at first sight  Rien qui gene rien serré  we may be allowed to speak of a people in this language who seem to resemble the French more than any of their nearer neighboursThe old Irish families stile themselves  Milesians  from Milesius a Spaniard who brought over a colony of his countrymen to people the islandBut I should think from their manners as I hinted at before that they were originally derived rather from the FrenchI hate all national reflections but they seem not to have any thing of the Spanish character among them  The court which is called the Castle here is extremely agreeable as well as brilliant both in beauty and finery  it abounds particularly with the formerI think I never saw so many handsome women together in any place as I have seen here on a ball nightBeauty is not however so general in this kingdom as in England it is chiefly confined to the higher ranks of life while there I have observed that it was most frequently met with in the middling and lower classes  I have run this letter into such an extravagant length that tho' I am very well inclined to proceed in the picturesque stile and give you an idea of lord Lucan  en gros  which is certainly as much as I can venture to pretend to at present I find my paper has circumscribed me within the limits of the smallest miniature and as my art cannot yet rise to  the nicer touches requisite to that small scale I shall begin his portrait on a new sheet next post in the mean time this will barely allow me to assure you that my affection and tenderness are if possible encreased by the unhappiness of my ever dear Fanny  LOUISA BARTON  Miss Leister is highly pleased with the title you have given her and says she will charge all her poetic swains to celebrate her henceforward by the name of  Iris  LETTER VIII  Miss CLEVELAND to Lady BARTON  MY dear Louisa's agreeable  melange  gave me infinite pleasure as I am very certain it is an exact representation of her soft yet lively mindI am sorry the gloomy picture I sent of my own affected you even transientlyLovers my dear are a strange inconsistent race of mortals their pains and pleasures so totally dependant upon trifling accidents and yet so exquisite that they are scarcely to be considered as rational beingsYou who are not of the sighing tribe will be amazed when I tell you that at the time I received the effusions of your sympathetic tenderness I had almost forgotten the source  of my own distress and could have cried out with Orestes  "I never was unhappy"  After this I think I need not tell you that I had just then received a letter from Lord Hume He is well and kind my sister but alas he talks of spending three years on his tourWe are both young 'tis certain but three years are three centuries in a lover's calendarand should he hold his purpose I should fancy myself old as a Sybil or as Cybele before that time may elapse  Tho' I detest the maxim you have quoted from Rochfoucault I do not blame you for rejoicing in your own ease and tranquility but you surely might  do so though I were not in loveand yet perhaps the idea of your own felicity would not have struck you so strongly if you had not then thought me miserable They say it is in sickness that health is only valued I fear there is a certain perverseness in human nature that enhances the value of every blessing from the privation of itI had conceived an idea here but fear I have not sufficiently expressed it but what I mean is that as a friend is a second self you have had the happy occasion of comparing the good and ill together without the sad experience of the latter  You see I am becoming a philosopher againbut alas Louisa my philosophy is literally the sport of chance for I confess that the only happiness I am at present  capable of enjoying is absolutely dependant on winds tides postboys and a thousand other wayward contingencies  I very sincerely join with you in wishing since you have not yet that you may never feel the passion of love in an extreme degree for I am firmly persuaded that it does not contribute much to the happiness of the female worldand yet Louisa I will frankly tell you that I am extremely grieved at some hints you have dropped in your letters which speak a want of affection for Sir WilliamIt is dangerous to sport with such sentiments you should not suffer them to dwell even upon your own mind much less express them to otherswe ought not be too strict in analyzing the characters of those we wish to love  if we once come to habituate ourselves to thinking of their faults it insensibly lessens the person in our esteem and saps the foundation of our happiness with our love  I am perfectly convinced that you have fallen into this error from want of reflection and through what is called  une maniere de parler  for I will not suppose that my Louisa tho' persuaded by her friends and solicited most earnestly by Sir William gave him her hand without feeling in her heart that preference for his person and esteem for his character which is the surest basis for a permanent and tender affection  I almost condemn myself for the severity of this stricture but my Louisa's  happiness is of too much consequence to mine to pass over an error that may destroy it unnoticed before she is aware We are all wiser for others than ourselves but let this pretence to sagacity be pardoned by an elder sister as proceeding from the tenderest affection of her's  most truly F CLEVELAND  PS Sir George holds his purpose and sets out in two daysI shall not accompany him nor can I at present accept of your kind and soothing invitation I mean that in the first part of your letterI abominate your volatile idea of an Hibernian or any other swain as a remedy for hapless loveAdieu my Louisa and forgive me the matronly airs I have  assumed in this letter for I shall think myself extremely happy if in the future correspondence of our lives I do not make you more than amends by affording you in your turn many opportunities of appearing as much wiser than I as you are in reality  LETTER IX  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  INDEED my Fanny I rejoice in your happiness tho' I cannot help feeling that I am a sufferer by it for if you had not received a very kind letter from Lord Hume you would not in all probability have had spirits sufficient to have written an unkind one to meYou are my dear sister perfectly acquainted  with every sentiment of my heart therefore to repeat what you already know is needless But in my own justification I must hold up a portrait to your view which from a very short absence you seem to have forgotten  By the loss of the best of parents I became my own mistress before I was seventeenmy brother who is three years elder than I was then returned from the university and set out almost immediately on his travels I then looked up to him as the sole stay both of your youth and mine and tho' my father's indulgence had rendered us all independent of each other I firmly resolved never to marry without the consent and approbation of Sir George  Young as you were you may remember that during the time we passed at my aunt Marriot's in Wiltshire there were several proposals of marriage made to me and among the rest Sir William offered me his hand but as my heart was by no means engaged by any of the persons who honoured me with their addresses I adhered to my first plan and referred them all to my brother's decisionas there had been no time fixed for Sir George's return most of those who called themselves my lovers withdrewbut Sir William either more enamoured or more artful than the rest set out immediately for Naples where my brother then was and by conciliating his esteem obtained his consent which he pretended was all that was wanting to complete his happiness  When my brother wrote to us to meet him at Paris I was transported at the thoughts of seeing him after a two years absence but did not once reflect upon his motive for sending for us nor did I even know that Sir William Barton was to be one of the partySir William's galantry in coming from Paris to meet us at Dover flattered my vanity I will c  nfess the continuance of his assiduities during our stay in France confirmed my brother's opinion of his passion for meBut alas I was still incapable of making any other return to his attentions than what mere politeness exacted from me  How often have my brother Sir William and you seemed to doubt my sincerity when I have declared I knew not  what love was and O how fatal has that inexperience been to my peace since Yes Fanny your sister is a wretch and gave away her hand before she knew she had a heart to transfer  Yet this I am convinced of that had Sir William persevered perhaps a few months longer in wishing still to obtain that heart it might I doubt not have been all his own But can it now bestow itself unsought and trembling yield to harshness and unkindness Impossible The little rebel owns as yet no lord and it may breck but it will never bow beneath a tyrant's frown  There never was any person's behaviour so altered as Sir William'sI perceived a visible change in his manners  before we left London but it has gone on in a blessed gradation ever since and is at length arrived at the  ne plus ultra  of matrimonial disgustI shall tell you a short story by way of instancing the uncouthness of my present situation with regard to himSir William is naturally humane at least he used to seem soI was applied to by a wretched family tenants of his own who had lost their intire substance by fireI immediately took ten guineas out of my purse to pay my charity when he with the most supercilious air imaginable took hold of my hand bid me put up my money and not meddle with matters that I did not understandsaid I was rather too young for a Lady Bountiful yet and that if I went on at that rate they would fire every cottage on his lands and he  should be run into a goal by my generosity I stood amazed at this haranguehowever I obeyed my husband by putting up the money but made Benson convey it to the poor sufferers as from a third person while they with transports of gratitude acknowleged their having received twenty pounds from Sir William tho' forbidden to reveal his bounty to his steward or any of his family on pain of his displeasure  Now pr'ythee tell me Fanny if you do not consider this as an instance of a peculiar sort of perverseness Why should he wish to restrain me from the virtuous pleasure of bestowing charity or endeavour to persuade me that he was totally devoid of it himself Chide me no longer my sister for what is much more  my misfortune than my faultand what a misfortune at my time of life to look forward to a length of years that must necessarily pass away  " Joyless loveless unindeared"  May you be happier far dissipation must now be my resource 'tis all that I have leftwhat a slight and worthless counterpoise for domestic felicity  I will change the subject We are to spend the Christmas at SouthfieldLord Lucan Colonel Walter and my Lucy are to accompany usnext to yourself she is the most agreeable companion I could have met withher mind is as delicate as her formand I can see that she is frequently hurt at the roughness of Sir William's manners tho'  she takes infinite pains to conceal her feelings from me on such occasionsI once wished that Colonel Walter would have fallen in love with her that I might have had the happiness of her living near me in the country but I am now convinced that they were not formed to make each other happy and that she woud have refused him had he been an emperor  She has made me her confidanteshe loves and is beloved by one of the most charming men in the world yet the odds are many against their ever being unitedI often tell her I envy her situation for surely there is something infinitely delightful in suffering for or with an amiable person whom we loveit almost equals the happiness of sharing their good fortune  I am sorry I did not sketch out Lord Lucan's portrait while I was in the vein but he is now so much altered that my former idea of him would bear no resemblance to what he appears at presentFrom the extreme of gaiety he is fallen into a profound gravity and sometimes appears gloomy and distraitIt is impossible to account for this change as he is much liked and admired by every one who knows him and I cannot conceive him to be in love as he is hardly ever absent from our coterie and I have never observed the least particularity in his behaviour or address to any member of it tho' there are a number of pretty and agreeable women in our circle  The Colonel perceives the alteration as well as I and seems to hint as if his  sagacity could discover the cause of it but I have never given him the least encouragement to reveal his friend's secret and I almost hate him for affecting to triumph over himI have another reason for disliking the Colonel which I will not at present communicate even to youhe continues to court Mrs Layton but I will not take upon me to say they will be married tho' I am sure it would make her very miserable to doubt it  There is an orphan niece of Sir William's a very lovely girl at a boarding school hereI have endeavoured to prevail on him to let her live with usShe is near fifteen which in my mind renders her present situation extremely improper and indeed I have a particular dislike to a boardingschool education for  girls at any age as they must necessarily contract from it two qualities that I detest formality and insincerityHarriet Westly has just written to her uncle to second my request and he has complied with it tho' in his ungracious manner by adding an observation by way of codicil to his consent  "That two women in a house are two too many"  Perhaps Sir William only meant to be witty and not illnatureda play upon words is apt to dazzle those who cannot play with themI am glad Colonel Walter was not by when this ingenious remark was made as he seems to take a particular pleasure in repeating Sir William's bon mots  As the scene I am engaged in is not extremely active my dear Fanny must be contented with letting me fill my paper with such trivial and domestic occurrences as may arise from day to day nor must she expect order or connection in any of my lettersI write at every leisure moment and am perhaps interrupted ten times in the filling of a pageYou are very differently situated mistress of your leisure and yourself and I cannot forgive your barely mentioning events in which you know I am extremely interested as they relate to a brother and a sister whom I can never cease to love and therefore I can readily pardon your reprehending the weakness the indiscretioncall it any thing but a fault of your affectionate  LOUISA BARTON  PS I know not whether I told you before that Lord Hume and Lord Lucan are intimately acquainted  LETTER X  Miss CLEVELAND to Lady BARTON  BELIEVE me my ever dear Louisa when I tell you that my heart feels at this moment the tenderest sympathy with yours and most truly resents the unhappiness of your situation I will chide no more my sister but henceforward endeavour to sooth those sorrows which I cannot cureDissipation as you say must be your course any thing is better than brooding over irremediable evils yet great are the hazards which a young and beautiful married woman has  to run who enters too deeply into a life of gaietythe grave part of the world will censure her conduct as arising from the levity of her mind and the dissolute will form schemes for the destruction of that innocence which is the only true foundation and support of chearfulness or vivacity  Beware of artful men my dear sister I cannot help it I will tell you all my sears they may be nay I hope they are quite vain But I will confess I do not like your intimacy either with Lord Lucan or Colonel WalterI am persuaded that you have not the least apprehension from your connection with them but remember Louisa  "The dangers that we see are easily prevented but those strike surest that come unexpected  like lightning which we view and feel at once"  I am much pleased that Sir William's niece is to live with you there is a something flattering even to virtue in having a constant witness to approve our conduct at least I think we should be more at ease more selfassured in any trial with a companion than when left alone  "Not that I think my sister so to seek or so unprincipled in virtue's book"  to need a guard save her own purity  I remember poor Sterne used to say that all the mischief which was done in this great city was brought about by morning têteatêteswhich must be unavoidable without a female inmate and she should always be a near relationOn  this principle I think you extremely lucky in having Miss Westly for an  eleve  as her presence will be a perpetual guard against another danger you have to fear the envenomed tongue of Slander  The house is an uproar what can be the matter Sir George is returnedI fly to him  O Louisa my heart is in rent in pieces I have seen my brother almost distracted his manly face bedewed with flowing tears Miss Colville is dead she died at Amiens of a three days fevermy brother met her hearse at DoverI fear Louisa he will never recover this sad strokeSweet Delia I may say with the Queen in Hamlet  "I thought thy  bridebed to have decked sweet maid and not have strewed thy grave"  I cannot write more my tears blind meyou know that I most truly loved this dear departed saint her brutal mother is gone on to Paris would she and her whole race had perished in her steadMy brother's bell rings adieu adieu my sister  F CLEVELAND  LETTER XI  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  MY dearest Fanny your letter has affected me more than I can express I am indeed most truly grieved for my brother for the sweet Delia and yourselfyet why lament for her whose  state I envy her life was innocence her death was  arly would mine had been so tooYoung as she was she yet had tasted sorrow her mother's cruelty in first accepting Sir George's proposals for her and then rejecting him without a cause preyed on her tender heart she loved him Fanny and he deserved her passionher death has sealed his constancy her merits nay her beauties are graved upon his heart in their full lustre they will remain for ever undiminish'd in his memory and bloom before him from the silent tomb My dearest brother how my heart bleeds for thine  I would write to him Fanny but fear to encrease his grief by mentioning the causeyou will be watchful over his distress till time's lenient power shall  blunt the arrows of disastrous love and soften its sharp pangs to gentle melancholy why am I not with you to share this tender office alas why am I not any where but where I am  O my sister  "I could a tale unfold"  but I will not add to your present distress nor take off your attention from that dear brother to whom it may be useful to bestow it on one to whom it cannot be of service but who will ever be with the tenderest affection to Sir George and you a faithful  friend and sister LOUISA BARTON  PS As soon as my spirits will permit I shall reply to the first part of your  last letterI will not now my Fanny insist on regular answers as I am sure you will devote every moment of your time to our dear mourner But if any extraordinary particular relative to poor Delia shoud come to your knowledge pray acquaint me with it  LETTER XII  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  I Now sit down to thank my dearest Fanny for the kind caution she gave me in the first part of her last letter I will try if possible to forget the melancholy conclusion of it and reply only to what relates to myselfI have had Harriet Westley with me for some days and find as much comfort in her innocent and chearful society as my unhappy  situation will admit But alas she is incapable of administering either consolation or advice to me her knowledge of the world is even less than mine nor would I for that world render her wretched by reposing the distresses of my perturbated mind in her soft bosomO Fanny there is neither friend nor confidante for a married woman who does not find them both in her husband  I am almost afraid to communicate my thoughts to you yet why for they are innocentbut letters may miscarry a thousand accidents bring them to light and oft undo the peace of the poor writerbut I have nought to lose my peace is fled your apprehensions are but too well sounded I am in the most imminent  danger from my acquaintance with Colonel Walterbut as Isabella says  "Danger Claudio 'tis here and every where our forced companion the rising and the setting sun beholds us environed with it our whole life's a journey ending in certain ruin"  Woud mine were come to the last stage  I told you before that Lord Lucan was extremely altered from gay to grave and that Colonel Walter affected to know the cause of this sudden transition and repeatedly offered to acquaint me with it which I constantly declined and turned it off with raillery  I will confess to you that I before suspected what the Colonel meant to inform me of Women are generally too quick sighted  in these matters and I by no means wished to have my doubts upon this subject confirmed I observed that whenever Lord Lucan was present the Colonel used to strive to sit as near me as possible and frequently whisper nothing in my ear then laugh as if he had said something smart and lively I have often looked grave and sometimes silly on these occasions but could not divine the meaning of this absurd behaviour till this morning  I was at work in my dressingroom and Harriet reading to me when Lucy came inI could visibly discover that something had affected or ruffled her mind and therefore made a pretence to send Harriet out of the roomAs soon as she was gone Lucy burst into tears  and drew a letter out of her pocket which she had just received from Colonel Walter she made a thousand apologies for putting it into my hands but said she knew not how to act upon so nice and critical an occasionthe contents were as follow  To Miss LEISTER  Dear Madam  THE friendship you profess for Lady Barton of which I can no more doubt the sincerity than my own to you inclines me to acquaint her through such a proper medium of an affair which I think of some consequence to her but of which she at present seems wilfully ignorant through I dare say you and every other person who knows her except Sir William have long seen the ardent passion which Lord Lucan has conceived for her  Now really my dear Lucy it is a thousand pities that such a fine young man should waste his life in sighs and groans for a perverse beauty who will not even deign to own that she perceives his passion We all know it is impossible that she can love her husband and in that case it is highly propable that she should love somebody else and why not her poor sighing swain  I have tried every possible means to prevail on Lord Lucan to avow his passion but the simpleton denies it even to me though he must be sensible that I have seen its rise and progress from the first moment he beheld her at Pangor Ferry to this present writingI have even attempted to make him jealous by an affected familiarity with Lady  Barton though both she and you know  que mon coeur est devoüe a madame votre tante  but all this I'll swear I did in pure good will in hopes of bringing the lovers to an explanation which might possibly prevent their going on at the absurd rate they do at presentYou know my dear Lucy that I have a very high opinion of Lady Barton I therefore could not presume to mention Lord Lucan as a lover for her ladyship if I were not perfectly convinced that he is as true a Platonic as she or even your little romantic self  I would not by any means have you venture to shew her this letter but you ladies have a thousand agreeable ways of conveying a secret to each other especially where you have reason to imagine  that the information will not be displeasing  I shall have the honour of seeing you this evening at Mrs Layton's but pray don't take notice of this letter to her or to any other person but the one whom it concerns  Adio mia bella e buona figliuola    J WALTER  I shall never be able to describe what I felt upon reading this detestable scroll this outrage to honour delicacy friendship virtue But how to act it was impossible to think of shewing such a letter to a husband as the consequences must in all probability and ought to have been fatalAnd neither Lucy nor I could submit to the meanness of telling a falsehood by saying she had not shewn me the letter  In this dilemma I determined on sending for Colonel Walter myself to speak my sentiments to him upon the occasion which I didHe came and on my asking him what I had ever done to provoke his malice or how he dared to insult me by his letter to Miss Leister he burst into an affected laugh and said he was sorry to find that English Ladies had no idea of a jest that he really meant nothing more than a little  badinage  and to bring about a kind of Platonic galantry between Lord Lucan and me which might serve to amuse us in the long evenings we were to pass together at Southfield but if his raillery had given me a moment's pain he asked my pardon and promised never to offend again on the same subject  I was in prudence obliged to acquiesce with this insincere submission but from this hour I know him for mine enemyO Fanny what a situation is mine would to heaven I could exchange it for that of our dear departed Deliashe is at peace my sisterwhile IBut let me not distress you farthertell me I conjure you tell me that my brother's virtue and philosophy have calmed his sorrows and that he now only feels that sort of tender regret which arises from the fond idea of a long absent friendTell me something of yourself but let that something give me leave to hope that you are happy and I shall repine the less at my own wretchednessMy true love waits on Sir George and you Adieu my Fanny  LOUISA BARTON  LETTER XIII  Miss CLEVELAND to Lady BARTON  MY dear Louisa I have received both your letters and really think no situation can be more difficult than yours but as you see the precipice before you I will trust in that good Providence which is the guardian and support of innocence that he will enable you to avoid itI am persuaded I felt as much resentment as yourself on reading Colonel Walter's letter I perfectly approve of your not shewing it to Sir William but I cannot by any means divine what could be the motive for writing it  Ever since you mentioned the change in Lord Lucan's behaviour I have had  some apprehensions of his passion for you but would not hint them for fear of giving you uneasinessO my Louisa how nicely circumspect must your conduct be if you mean to escape the dangers that surround you and how much brighter than gold seven times tried in the furnace will that conduct appear when it has passed through more than a trial ordeal unsullied and unhurt  You have never given me the least reason to apprehend that Sir William is inclinable to jealousy this is certainly a very fortunate circumstance in your present situation but do not suffer yourself to be lulled into a state of security by his apparent indolence vigilant and watchful must that woman be who has so many foes to shield againstthe unkindness  of Sir Williamthe passion and merits of Lord Lucanthe arts and malice of Colonel Walterbut the last and most formidableshall I venture to speak outis your own heart  You have not yet begun to suspect it It is therefore the more dangerous enemy Examine it my sister call it to strict account and if you find one sentiment or wish that lurks in secret there unworthy of yourself banish it I beseech you thoughts even without purposes are criminal where our honour is in question Consider the slightest idea of this kind as a young serpent though stingless now its growth will give it strength and power to wound the breast that nursed and cherished it crush it betimes Louisa and be at peace for life  I weep faster than I write my brother's unhappiness and yours have sunk my spirits to the lowest ebb he is still inconsolableHe has received a most extraordinary letter from brute ColvilleI can call her nothing elseshe says  "She hopes he has by this time surmounted his grief for her daughter as it is highly irrational to mourn for one who is so surely happyShe intreats him to go directly to Paris as she has something very particular to inform him of relative to Delia's last request which she will not communicate by letter"  This hint has roused Sir George's curiosity or rather awakened the fond desire of fulfilling any wish that Delia might have made yet he says he could not bear the fight of Mrs Colville whom  he considers as her daughter's murderer and the destroyer of his earthly happiness  I know not what to think of this affair but I most earnestly wish that he would go any whereexercise is always of service to an oppressed mindlike the wheels of a machine it lessens the weight which rest restores againhowever Sir George shall not go by Amiens if he goes at all and that I have any power to persuade him  No one can tell where Lord Hume has been for some time pastthe  only  letter I received was dated from Naples which he said he should quit the next day and write to me the moment he was determined to fix at any placeIf  a brother's and sister's unhappiness did not at present take up all my thoughts and as it were usurp the place of my own sorrow I could allow it ample scope Louisa but I will now restrain it at least within my own breast and indulge myself in the more generous sensation of grieving for the distresses of those who are more wretched and not less dear to me than myself  Sir George returns your love an hundred fold I have never given him the least hint of your being unhappy as I knew it would render him still more soI do not think that even a brother should interfere between husband and wife unless matters were come to such extremities as I hope they never will between Sir William and you  I would by all means wish you to make a friend tho' not a confidante of the young Harriet if her heart and understanding be good her want of knowledge in the ways of the world will not render her a less eligible companion or adviser There is something extremely striking in the natural sentiments of an untainted mindthey resemble the purity and delicacy of water drank at the fountain before it has been impregnated with these adventitious flavours which it acquires in its currency  I know not why but I am vastly prejudiced in Harriet's favourI am apt to think she will lessen your domestic uneasinesses or at least prevent your brooding over them in solitude and  silenceIf I ever visit you in Ireland I shall endeavour to obtain a corner of her little innocent heart this will be no robbery for I flatter myself that she will love you the better the more she loves me  Miss Granville is returned from Bath she is at present my only companionwithin these two days Sir George has admitted her into his apartment She has lost all her spirits and vivacity and is perfectly qualified to perform the part of a mute in a tragedy for she sighs often and never speaks she has not however communicated the cause of her mourning to me yet I fancy if she were obliged to sing a French song  Maudit amour  would be the first that would occur to her  You will easily perceive that my letters like yours are written at different intervals and I hope you will also perceive that my spirits are better than when I began this epistle tho' nothing particular has happened to enliven them except my taking an airing with Sir George and my quondam admirer Mr Loyd in Richmond Park this morning  The moral of the tale I sing as before is that air and exercise are the best medicines in the world both for mind and bodyBy the way I hope you both continue and indulge your passion for ridingI hear the outlets about Dublin are delightful you will be unpardonable if you don't visit them all  Pray give my love to the little Harriet you may also offer it to Sir William for indeed I am very well inclined even to  bestow  since he will not suffer me to  pay  it to him  Adieu adieu ma tres chere soeur  F CLEVELAND  PS Pray enquire of Lord Lucan if he ever hears from lord Hume  LETTER XIV  Lord HUME to Lord LUCAN  Naples  YES my dear Lucan I will acknowledge your censure just in some degree and that I think is full as much as can be expected from a person of my lively and volatile dispositionwe idle fellows are seldom perverse enough to defend our follies or perhaps the same indolence of temper which makes us commit prevents our justifying themno matter from what principle our humility arises I hate searching for remote causes'tis like seeking for a grain of wheat in a bushel of chaff I never was a good logician tho' a very tolerable sophist for myself at least and  while I find the effects of my passion for the lovely Margarita pleasant I shall never perplex myself with endeavouring to find out why they are so  You cannot my dear Lucan have an idea of any thing half so charming or you would not only excuse but countenance my fondness by your own admirationNo hang it I should not like that eithernor would I have you see her for a thousand guineas notwithstanding what you say of your being already in loveyou know I thought myself the most enamoured swain alive when I left England and used to write you the most doleful accounts of my sufferingsyou laughed  t them then I laugh at them now  tempora aut mores mutantur  no matter which I can't help  however sometimes feeling a little qualm not of conscience tho' Lucan for my former mistressshe is handsome I confess but Margarita is divine  When I landed on the continent I was such a novice in love as to fancy that I could not bear a six month's absence from Fanny Cleveland but I had not been six days acquainted with my present object when I found that I could sacrifice friends country nay myself to her I had never felt passion before And  "What's life without passion sweet passion of love"  I have I hope dealt like a man of honour with Miss Cleveland by not dissembling with her I have written but once to her since I came here and  then told her I intended to stay abroad for three years and had not fixed upon any place of residence nay even said I should quit Naples directly merely to prevent her writing to me  I hope she will understand all this properly and that her pride will get the better of whatever regard she might have had for me and that whenever I return to England if that should ever happen I may find her what I really wish married intirely to her own satisfactionfor notwithstanding my infidelity I think it impossible that I should ever be capable of divesting myself of the warmest interest in her happiness I have now my dear Lucan laid my heart as open before you as I would were I a catholic to my confessor I expect much more from  you than I should from him not only absolution and indulgence but a reciprocal confidence alsoTell me who and what this fair Hibernian is whose torrid charms have been able to thaw your frozen zone Is it  une affaire de coeur ou d'honneur  is she kind or cruel brown or fair in short deal as frankly with me as I have done with you and we shall then have mutually exchanged the truest test of friendship with each other  Yours most truly HUME  PS I purpose spending the winter here and setting out early in spring either to Rome or Venice which ever my fair compass points her taper index to that we may enjoy the carnival together  LETTER XV  Lord LUCAN to Lord HUME  MY dear Hume your letter has relieved me from a thousand apprehensions which I suffered on your accountit is written in the true spirit of a heart at ease which no man ever possessed that was thoroughly in loveand though you call me grave and philosophic I am much better pleased that your present attachment should be of the frolic than the serious kindMost of our young men of fortune and fashion look upon a foreign mistress as a part of their travelling equipage and I think Margarita as well qualified to fill up the train of  milord Anglois  as any other of her sister syrensof the opera  I have seen her often and acknowledge her beauty though I could gaze on her for ever without feeling any other effect from her charms but what might arise in my mind from contemplating her pictureyet I do not think her inanimate on the contrary she has great vivacity both in her looks and manners but alas she is totally devoid of sensibility that first of female charms her eyes are taught to languish and every graceful movement of her form has been acquired in the school of artRead the thirtyseventh and fiftieth letters of Ninon de l'Enclos to the marquis de Sevig  é and they will help you to judge more justly both of her and yourself they are cases exactly in point  She lived with the marquis de Richelieu at Turin when I was thereI  knew him intimately he adored Margarita and was one of the handsomest and most amiable young men I ever met withhe died of a fever I pitied Margarita from my soul and about ten days after his death went to pay her a visit of condolance and was informed she had set out for Naples two days before with an English gentleman whose name was Williams  I am much too young to set up for a stoic or a cynic I know nay I feel all the weaknesses and follies of youth yet I cannot help thinking that an attachment to a worthless woman is capable of debasing the noblest mindVirtue I fear is not radical in human nature its seed must be sown by precept cherished by example and cultivated  by habit but when the object of our affections has a distinct interest rather to extinguish than inspire it the general bias of our passions aided by the natural indolence of dissipation and debauchery suffer the plant to wither in its bloom and thus obliterates the truest character of manhood  On the contrary let the most vicious man become truly enamoured of a virtuous woman and he will at least assume the semblance of those virtues he admires in her and  "Use as Hamlet says can almost change the stamp of nature and master even the Devil or throw him out with wonderous potency"  I find myself growing grave prematurely for there is but one paragraph  in your letter that I meant to answer seriously you may easily guessI mean the one where you speak of Miss Cleveland and seem to acquiesce so intirely in your behaviour towards herand now that I have entered upon this subject I am at a loss to know how to treat it properlyI would fain persuade myself you were but in jest yet surely it is wrong to trifle with the esteem of a friend by suffering me to suppose that you could possibly behave so unworthily to a woman of merit and honour  That the gaiety and levity of your temper and your youth might render it possible nay probable that you should change your affections and cease to love a mistress you once admired I can readily believebut that you can suffer an  amiable woman whom you both flattered and inspired with a serious passion for you to be informed of your inconstancy through so coarse a medium as rudeness and neglect I will not nay I cannot supposeMy friend knows better what he owes to himself and to the world  I must be excused from replying to your queries relative to the object of my passion except so far as to afford you some faint description of her beauty and merits Her personal charms are so obvious that whoever views her does not wait to judgethey strike so suddenly that we feel before we think The excellencies of her character require some refinement to become sensible ofone must have a nice discernment for natural beauties and a  certain classic taste for the  great simple  Her mind is in such a state of  perfect  nature that she is not to be examined by the rules of common life for her words her actions and her whole manners borrow a peculiar propriety from herself aloneShe appears to be a sort of privileged genius of whom may be said with Milton  " That whatso'er she says or does  " Seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best"  In others we may trace the mechanical finger of the nurse the mother the tutoress or the priestIn her can be discovered but one only forming handeven his who made her  In fine such beauties both of mind and person have inspired your till now insensible friend with the most tender  ardent and hopeless love that ever yet possessed a human heart and in my breast shall that fond love lie ever buriedI think it will not cease even with my life but death itself shall never force me to reveal my passion  Press me no farther on this theme my friend nor cast away your useless pity on me for while I can behold her lovely form and gaze in silent rapture on her beauty I am not wretchednay in those blissful moments I feel a sort of happiness I would not change for all your joys with Margarita  You may very probably have but an imperfect idea of that kind of passion which I have described but do not from thence unphilosophically conclude that  it cannot exist in any heart because you do not feel it in your own This I know to be a common but erroneous mode of judgingwe are all too apt to search in our own breasts for the motives of other people's actions and when a want of sympathy of sentiment prevents our discovering similar principles in ourselves we are too often tempted to deny their existence in others  I have particularly warn'd you my dear Hume on this subject because I am certain I could full as easily forgive your doubting my honour as the unsullied purity of my passionI most sincerely wish you every pleasure that a life of frolic and gayety can yield but beware my dear Hume of those thorns that grow spontaneous with the rose  Write to Miss Cleveland I conjure you and when your leisure will permit bestow a few lines on yours sincerely  LUCAN  LETTER XVI  Lord HUME to Lord LUCAN  MAY I perish this moment if ever I read such a letter I shall begin to look upon Ovid's Metamorphoses as a history of serious and natural events and not be at all surprised if I should find myself fluttering through the air in the form of a lapwing or a butterflySurely your transformation is still more miraculous what Lucan the gay the lively Lucan changed into a melancholy timid whining lovesick swain  "and death itself shall never force him to reveal  his passion"  Why what in the name of nonsense must she be that has inspired it deaf and blind I supposefor no woman that has ears and eyes need ever be informed that a man is in love with herin those cases they are sharpsighted as the lynx and quickeared as the mole and I would lay a thousand guineas that your Dulcinea was thoroughly informed of her conquest before you were even aware of it yourself  But why you are so cruelly bent upon not indulging her with a repetition of her triumph I cannot for my soul conceiveI have formed a million of conjectures about whom and what she is and have at length acquiesced in believing her to be the sanctified spouse of some methodist teacher or presbyterian parson for  you have according to your own plan  "assumed the semblance of those virtues"  which such a puritan fair one might also pretend to  And so poor  "Margarita is compounded of art and wants the first of female charms sensibility"  Beware my friend that your idol may not have one vice more at least than mine I mean hypocrisythe marquis de Richelieu is still remembered and regretted by Margarita though she did not absolutely break her heart for his loss as you may perhaps vainly imagine your dovelike dame your  saint trembleur  whom nothing but the spirit can move would do for you  In short you are welcome to make as free with me as you please the privileges  of friendship permit it but neither its laws nor those of chivalry can pardon an affront or injury offered to the heroine of our romanceBesides you must be but a bad philosopher Lucan if you do not know that there is such a perverseness in human nature that the abusing a mistress is the surest way of rivetting the lover's chains  " I'll be revenged and love her better for it"  And so you are very angry that I have not written a full and true account of my inconstancy to Miss Cleveland why how the devil can any man sit down to tell a woman that he no longer loves her But 'tis a proper measure  I owe it to myself and to the world  I repeat your words seriously here for I think them justAnd now you will for ever oblige me my  dear Lucan if you will do it for me for may I die this moment if I am not so wholly illiterate in this  noble science of defence  that I know not even how to set about it  On my honour I both respect esteem and admire Miss Cleveland more than any woman in the world however the caprice of my heart may have rendered me capable of an infidelity and I most devoutly wish that I had address enough to extricate myself out of this unlucky business without sacrificing any more of my character than I fear is already forfeited  I cannot help smiling when you say  "while I can behold her lovely form"  c But I must acknowledge this to be  the best perhaps the only receipt in the world for insuring our constancyI'll frame it into a distich extempore for the help of memory  Your love would you preserve the same  Still fan but never feed the flame  If you were at Rome instead of Dublin I should swear that you were turned Virtuoso and became enamoured of Madame la Venus de Medicis or some other old fashioned marble beautythe world's a farce and it is acted thusthe bad impose on others the good deceive themselves  But happiness the way we chuse it is sufficient for us all and as you are so very reasonable in your option they must be niggards indeed who would desire to deprive you of the least portion of it  therefore that you may long possess  ideas  is the complying wish of yours ever  HUME  LETTER XVII  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  Southfield  January  I Have this moment received my dear Fanny's last letter though from the date I think I should have been in possession of it much sooner but perhaps Sir William detained it on purpose to deliver it to me on this day as knowing it to be the most agreeable newyear's gift he could have presented me with In return then my Fanny accept my thanks and fervent prayer for your happiness  But I have something more substantial than wishes to contribute towards it for I can with truth inform you that the little time I have spent here has passed away much more agreeably than any that has elapsed since I left Doverstreet  To a mind not perfectly at ease there is something extremely pleasing in the quietness of the country it is like that artificial repose which is acquired by opiates after long watchinglike that too though it neither strengthens nor nourishes it allows us time to recover our faculties which are often as much harrassed by living constantly in the midst of crouds as our nerves are by an acute disease  I am very glad to find that Sir William loves the country and is particularly fond of this place where nature seems to have exerted her utmost powers to pleaseIf it is charming now when stripped of all its ornaments think what it will be when summer shall redeck it in its leafy pride and spread her gorgeous carpet o'er the plains  I look forward with delight to the happy aera of your arrival here which I hope will be early in spring and as the Irish parliament meet but every second winter I purpose spending the intermediate time of their recess in this sweet retirement with my Fanny my Harriet my books music drawing planning planting and perhaps there may be a little interloper who will I trust increase  both our pleasures and employmentsmy Lucy too will be near if not with us for Colonel Walter's house is about five miles from hence and every thing seems in great forwardness for his marriage with Mrs Layton  I begin to  flatter  myself that he is really in love with the lady he is going to marry for he talks of her incessantly yet Lucy has remarked that he spends more of his time here than at Mr Usher's where Mrs Layton is now upon a visit though that is two miles nearer to Waltersburgh that is the name of his seat than this  He is to give a magnificent ball at his house next week he asked me last night to dance with him on that occasion which I refused as I thought he ought  to shew every mark of attention to his future brideI shall not however dance with any other person not so much on his account as for a reason I have hinted at above  I fear you will chide me for not having mentioned my present situation to Sir William as it is natural to suppose it would give him pleasure and indeed I wish to do so but there is something so indelicate in his manner of treating this subject that I have not yet been able to prevail upon myself to speak of it to him  Lord Lucan has been absent from us some days on a visit to Sir Arthur Ashfordthey are both expected here this eveningI have great pleasure in observing  that Lord Lucan is vastly more chearful and seemingly at his ease than he was before we left Dublinindeed I think we are all so which serves to illustrate your favourite opinion as well as the latter part of your last letter that air exercise and change of objects are of infinite use both to the mind and body  From my not mentioning my brother till now do not conclude that I have for a moment forgotten him or his griefs they will live together in my memory to the last period of my existenceI cannot conceive why Mrs Colville should wish to see Sir George as she must be conscious of having done him an irreparable injury and sure there is nothing on earth so formidable as the sight of a person we have  wrongedYet I earnestly wish that he knew his Delia's request as the obeying it would afford him a very high though a melancholy pleasure  " Sad luxury to vulgar minds unknown"  I wish too with you that he would go abroadDo my Fanny send him to search for your wanderer on the continent and in the mean time do you take sanctuary in this island which boasts a privilege of being free from all noisome animalsyou may therefore at least promise yourself safety if not delight amongst us  I am sorry for the change you mention in Mary Granville her charming vivacity would I hoped have assisted you in keeping up your spirits under the treble  pressure of my brother's mine and your own distresses which I begin to fear will soon outweigh our's for I think that even the death of the object of our affections is more supportable than their unkindnessThis hint is meant to arm you for I confess that Lord Hume's silence has made me think he is in the high road of inconstancy and I do most earnestly wish that you would endeavour to forget him and be happy  I have my dearest sister at your request most seriously examined my heart and will candidly acquaint you with its real situation'Tis free from love and thence is all its dangerO why am I debarred the chaste indulgence of a virtuous passion why must a heart that overflows with tenderness have all  its currents dammed like a poor river forced from its natural course am I to blame if it should steal away in useless nay improper channels  But hitherto my sister all is safethe man I most esteem I have no passion for nor feel a fonder warmth on mentioning his name than my dear brother'sthis surely is an innocent affectionHad I been his wifebut you have warned me not even to hazard much less indulge such thoughts  Harriet is vastly happy at your predilection for her and bids me offer you the second place in her heartshe kindly and I believe at present truly says I occupy the firstyours is I think likely to be the most permanent station  as I shall have many rivals to contend for mine and happy will he be who shall displace me  Lucy who came hither with me is this day gone to pay her respects to her aunt at Mr Usher's we are to meet them at Waltersburgh next Monday and she is then to return with me to Southfield where we have alas but a very few days to spend before we set out for Dublin I shall truly regret the changing of the scenebut must obey  Sir William returns his affectionate compliments to my brother and you and was kind enough to say he wished you would both come over and see how we live herewhat is still more extraordinary he seemed both surprised and  concerned when I told him of our dear Delia's death for he is sometimes tender when he is off his guard so that I often flatter myself that 'tis rather his manners which are harsh and not his nature hard You see how I strive to sooth myself and plead for him He says he cannot be persuaded that she could die in three days unless it were of a French physician  Sir Arthur Ashford his sister and Lord Lucan are this moment arrived I have never seen the Lady but hear she is extremely handsome grant heaven that Lord Lucan may think so now Fanny you can have no doubts or fears  Adieu my sister  L BARTON  LETTER XVIII  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  REPORT does not always exaggerateMiss Ashford is really beautifulthe ladies of this country are in general remarkably fair but the whiteness of her skin surpasses any that I have ever seen her eyes are dark hazel her hair jet black which forms such a contrast to her neck and forehead as images Shakespear's simile  " Fairer than snow upon a raven's back"  She is tall and thin and though not elegantly made appears perfectly genteelwhile she sits stillbut the moment she is thrown into motion or emotion she ceases to be lovelya something  more than want of grace accompanies her action and every movement of her head or hands seems performed in opposition to naturein short she is the only young person I have ever seen whom vivacity does not become She seems sensible mild goodnatured and in every respect qualified for making an amiable figurein  still life  I am much pleased to find that Sir William is extremely hospitable to his country neighbours and likes to have company in his house This tendency may doubtless be attended with some inconveniences which I had rather submit to than live unknown and unloved amongst one's tenants and dependantsit is their industry and labour which supports our affluence and they certainly  have a right to a certain share in our enjoyments in proportion to their rank and situation  An accident that happened this morning had like to have triumphed over Sir William's good humour which is not of the invincible kindAs we sat at breakfast in a room that looks into the garden I observed Miss Ashford's eyes fixed on a particular object in the walk before usI thought she seemed surprised and I naturally directed a look of inquiry to discover the occasion which was a little basket that appeared to move though gently of itself  The moment I mentioned this circumstance the gentlemen came to the window and Lord Lucan flew directly into the  garden and explained the phenomenon by bringing the basket and its contents into the parlour which was an infant about a week old clean though poorly clad with a paper pinned to its breast which said  this child has been baptized by its father's name William  This circumstance disconcerted Sir William who after many unnecessary asseverations of his innocence upon this occasion at which the whole company smiled as they knew that he had been above a year out of the kingdom determined to prove his virtue at the expence of his humanity by ordering the child to be again left in the garden where it was found till the parish officers should come to take charge of it and by commanding a strict search to be  made for the mother that she might be punished  according to law  We all opposed the severity of this resolution as the poor infant appeared almost perished with cold and hunger but Sir William persisted in acting like an upright magistrate according to the  letter of the law  till Lord Lucan declared that he was ready to adopt the little foundling and promised to take care of it for life though his name was Thomas Sir William then relaxed a little of his austerity and gave vent to the remainder of it by attacking Lord Lucan with all the coarse raillery usual upon such occasions  I confess I was pleased with this instance of his Lordship's humanityI  have seen many others even in the short term of our acquaintanceyet at this instant I could wish to have robbed him of this little act of benevolence and have transferred it to Sir WilliamThere is a secret and involuntary sympathy that attaches us to generous mindsour affections are insensibly rivetted by esteem and in that case we may defy even the power of time to break the charming tye O why am I not bound in such a chain  Though you will see by my letter that I had nothing to say when I began to write yet as it is probable that I shall not have half an hour's leisure for some days to come I have devoted the present moment to convince my Fanny that she is never absent from my thoughts to enquire  after her's and Sir George's health and to assure her of the sincerest regard of her ever affectionate  L BARTON  LETTER XIX  Miss CLEVELAND to Lady BARTON  DIstracted as I am with my own griefs let me thank my dear sister for having removed some of those apprehensions which I had suffered on her account and by that means leaving my heart as it should now be devoted to selfish undivided sorrowLord Hume is false Louisa I am forsaken in the pride of youth but for whom I know not  I cannot write read the inclosed then give the hateful scroll to the devouring flamesno send it backalas for what the fatal lines are graved too deeply on my breaking heart  My brother set out for Paris last week a second letter from Mrs Colville more ambiguous than the former determined him I am glad he is goneI should have tried but fear it would have been in vain to hide my anguish from himand he has griefs too weighty of his own to suffer me to add resentment to them  You say your heart is free from love Louisa O triumph in that blest indifference and know you cannot taste the extreme of wretchedness without feeling  a tender passion for an unworthy object  " Ah fond remembrance blinds me"  If I were capable of joy I should receive it from the hint you give of your being soon likely to be blest with a proper object for your utmost sensibility Repine no more my sister but let the current of your fondness flow in this most natural and pleasing course in the rich channel of maternal love  I intreat you to acquaint Sir William as soon as possible with this happy event there are numberless reasons that render it proper those you urge against it are childish your situation must naturally increase his tenderness and of course your happiness which is all that  can now diffuse the smallest gleam of satisfaction to your ever affectionate  F CLEVELAND  PS I have this moment received a second letter from you for which I return my thanks but am not at present able to write more  LETTER XX  Lord HUME to Miss CLEVELAND  MADAM  A Consciousness of error is they say the first step toward reformation but there are some cases in which we may be sensible of having done amiss yet find it impossible to amend this is certainly a very unpleasing situation and well worthy of pity from a generous  mindSo circumstanced I acknowledge myself and throw myself at your feet for pardon  Can you madam rise so far above the unworthy man who asks it as to grant him your forgiveness while he confesses that the natural inconstancy of his sex and the mutability of his disposition have triumphed over a passion which was once his highest happiness and honour and which he then thought would have been as permanent as his life  I cannot without descending to the meanness of a falshood affect to suppose that I am indifferent to you I know but too well that I was honoured with a place in your affectionbut I also know that  Miss Cleveland has sense and resolution sufficient to conquer her regards for one who owns himself unworthy of itHumiliating confession  Let me however madam as a motive to your forgiveness plead the small and only merit that is in my favour the not having attempted to deceive youI can now only add that notwithstanding the change of my affections rather than my sentiments I shall ever retain the sincerest respect and if I may be allowed the expression the tenderest esteem for Miss Cleveland to whom I have the honour to be  a most devoted and obedient servant HUME  LETTER XXI  Miss WESTLEY to Miss CLEVELAND  Waltersburgh  HOW happy should I be my dear madam in having the honour of paying my respects to you by letter and thanking you for the kind partiality you have expressed in my favour to my dear aunt if her illness had not been the occasion of my writing but don't be alarmed madam she is at present out of danger though still so weak as to be unable to write even to you  She was taken ill the day after she came here and miscarried the day following How I grieve for the loss of my dear little cousin he would have been a charming  plaything for us all You can't imagine how much my uncle has fretted about it but though my poor dear aunt has the most reason to be sorry she bears every thing with her usual sweetness of temperbut I need not expatiate on her gentleness to you who know her for every creature who does must be charmed with her  Miss Leister who was to have been here with us was confined with a quinzy at Mr Usher's when my aunt grew ill but she came to us yesterday and the gentlemen are all gone to DublinIt was intended that we should be very merry when we arrived here but I never saw such a dismal house I long to get back to Southfield which I hope we shall be able to do in a few days  My aunt desires me to assure you of her tenderest affection and says she will write the moment she can hold a pen  I hope my dear Miss Cleveland will not take an aversion to me for being the messenger of disagreeable news but believe that it would have afforded me the sincerest pleasure to have informed her that my aunt was as well and happy as I know she deserves to be and I most truly wish her I have the honour to be dear madam  your much obliged and most obedient servant HARRIET WESTLEY  PS I don't know whether you are acquainted with Lord Lucan but I can't  help telling you that he had the misfortune to sprain his leg so that he could not dance or walk even the first day he camethere never was any thing so unlucky as this party has been for every one has had something to distress them  LETTER XXII  Miss CLEVELAND to Miss WESTLEY  I Lament with you my dear Harriet that our correspondence should commence on an occasion so painful to us both as Lady Barton's illness but I should be unworthy of that regard which you seem inclined to shew me if it were possible that I should conceive any dislike to you for acquainting me with our common misfortune I mean the loss of our  little cousinhowever as you assure me that my sister is at present out of danger I think we may reasonably hope that our present loss may be repaired in future and that we may yet have many pretty playthings in which we shall be mutually interested  The sweetness of Lady Barton's temper must interest all who know her in her sufferings of every kind and lessen even to herself the painful sensations arising from her present disagreeable situationSuch is the potent power of gentleness I have no doubt of your tender attachment to her there is a natural sympathy between the good and amiable which far exceeds the ties either of affinity or consanguinity  I have not the honour of knowing Lord Lucan but am sorry for the accident he  has met with both for his sake and yours as I fancy his lameness interfered with the amusement you proposed to yourself in dancingBut we are all liable to disappointments my young friend and may this be one of the greatest that you shall ever experience  Assure my beloved sister of my servent and unceasing wishes for her speedy recovery And believe me to be my dear Miss Westley's  affectionate friend and servant F CLEVELAND  LETTER XXIII  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  Waltersburgh  MY dearest Fanny I lay hold of the first possible moment to calm your fears for my safety I mean with regard to my health Harriet by my desire has given you an account of the accident that befel me here but she and all the world are strangers to the cause of it  But before I enter into a detail that must affect you let me congratulate my dearest sister upon the timely discovery of lord Hume's inconstancyRejoice my Fanny that this worthless man is not your husband and that you are at  liberty to indulge your resentment or contempt  without a breach of duty  This though you may not be sensible of it is certainly an allevation of the misery which arises from illplaced lovebut time and your sense and virtue will I hope enable you to triumph over any remain of weakness for such an unworthy objectYet contemptible as he is I cannot help being pleased with his letter frankness always charms me and like charity in my mind it covers a multitude of faults  Do not from what I have said imagine that I think lightly of your present distress I am convinced that to a heart tender and good as yours it must be severe but I also know that there are other situations much more intolerable  and I am almost tempted to exclaim with Lord Littleton  " What are alas thy woes compared to miner"  You shall be yourself the judge and I will now proceed  Sir Arthur Miss Ashford Lord Lucan Sir William Harriet and I set out together for this place the Monday after I wrote to youWe were to have met Mrs Layton Miss Leister the family of the Ushers and several other ladies and gentlemen of the neighbourhoodThe first mortification I received was hearing that my Lucy was ill of a sore throat and could not come from Usher's Grove her aunt and the rest of the family came but were all to return after supper  I told you in my last that I had refused to dance with Colonel Walter I was also asked by Lord Lucan but desired to be excused and entreated he would take Miss Ashford for his partner He said he would obey me and accordingly desired the honour of her hand which she readily grantedAbout a quarter of an hour before the ball began he unluckily strained his leg and was not able to fulfil his engagementSir William though not fond of dancing was polite enough to supply his place and Lord Lucan and I were reduced to play at quadrille with a couple of dowagers and an old parson  The evening however passed off very tolerably and we retired to our chambers about twelve o'clock The gentlemen  had agreed to meet and hunt the next morning and I determined to pay a visit to Lucy between breakfast and dinner that day for the Colonel had insisted on our not leaving him till the next  According to appointment with his companions of the chace Sir William rose early and left me asleep I had resolved not to acquaint him with my situation till our return to Southfield as I knew that many coarse jests and commonplace sayings would pass on the occasion which I should wish to avoid at all times but especially before strangers  About eight o'clock in the morning I was waked by a person who knelt at my bedside and pressed my hand to their lipsthe chamber was dark I could  only distinguish that it was a man and instantly concluded him to be Lord Lucan from this circumstance only that I recollected Colonel Walter was to have rode out with Sir WilliamI strove to withdraw my hand but could not upon which I addressed him with the strongest expressions of surprize and resentment at his having dared to take so unwarrantable a liberty to which he answered only in a whisper entreating me to forgive the effects of a passion too violent to be restrainedHe then attempted to press his lips to mine and when I was going to ring my bell I heard Sir William's voice upon the stairs and fainted  When I came to myself I found Miss Ashford Sir William and Harriet in  the room standing about my bedsideI suffered infinite anxiety at that instant to know whether Sir William had found Lord Lucan in my chamber and what had passed between them Harriet and Miss Ashford were bathing my temples with lavender water while Sir William held one of my hands between his and as soon as he found that I was recovering press'd it gently and withdrew saying that he supposed ladies understood how to manage one another better in such circumstances than hehis calmness amazed me in short the various emotions of my mind for some time are not to be expressed  I determined on the instant to return to Southfield directly let the consequence be what it would and never to suffer  Lord Lucan to come into my sight again but alas when I attempted to rise I found it impossible the agitation of my mind had disorder'd my whole frame my illness encreased every moment a messenger was dispatched for a physician but before he could arrive  When Sir William was informed of my misfortune he raved and stamped like a madman said I must have designed to destroy his heir out of perverseness or I would certainly have acquainted him with my situationwhile Heaven knows I would have given my own life with pleasure to have saved my child  I continued in a state of such extreme weakness for four days that I saw no creature but Benson who had been sent  for express the doctor and Harriet who wept continually by meI never can forget the dear girl's tenderness  On the fifth morning Sir William came into the room and with an air of the utmost disatisfaction told me he was very sorry for the loss of his boy but hoped I should do well and as he could not be of any use to a sick person he had resolved to attend the meeting of parliament and should set out for Dublin with the Colonel and Lord Lucan directlythat as soon as I was able I might either return to Southfield or follow him to town as I liked bestBut that I need not be in a hurry to move for his  good friend  had left orders that I should be as well attended as if I were in my own house and that Lucy Leister was now recovered  and would come that day to Waltersburg to keep me companyHe then gave me a cool kiss and withdrew  I rejoiced extremely at hearing that Lord Lucan was to go with Sir William for though my life was at stake I would not have remained in the same house with him after my husband had left it besides it saved me the difficulty of an interview which my poor weak brain had been studying to avoid the whole time of my illnessYet I had doubts and fears that he might insolently have made a pretence to stay behind till Benson assured me that she saw him set out at the same time with Sir William and the Colonel  Just as he was going off he gave the enclosed note to Harriet to deliver to  me as soon as I should be able to read it the sweet girl could not conceal her emotion about it she feared she had done wrong in receiving it and with her cheeks covered with blushes and her eyes filled with tears she presented it to me begging I would excuse her if she had acted improperly  I never was more embarrassed in my life than at that moment I could have no doubt but that his letter was filled with apologies for the audaciousness of his conduct and to read it was in some measure to admit of his excusesBut while I hesitated Harriet whose impatience seemed to be extreme had broken the seal and said shall I read it to you Madam Luckily for me that part of the chamber I sat in was so much darkened  by a large screen that she did not discover my confusion therefore taking my silence for consent she proceeded to read as follows  To Lady BARTON  PERMIT me Madam to express those ardent wishes for your recovery which I have never ceased to breathe to heaven from the first moment of your illnesswishes as pure as warm and as disinterested as brothers form for a beloved sister I hoped to have had the honour of seeing you before I leave Waltersburgh and I have many reasons to lament the loss of that happiness but the cause which has prevented it is even more a subject of regret than the effect and like Aaron's rod has swallowed up all other considerations  May returning health a wait your couch and may every happiness that heaven can grant to merit such as yours be as truly thine as the sincere respect and esteem of him who has the honour to be Madam your Ladyship's  most obedient servant LUCAN  PS If it be not thought too presuming I should request the favour of your permission for Miss Westley to honour me with a line to inform me of your health  I never felt surprise more strongly than at hearing this letter and my amazement was rather increased by the trepidation and hurry of Harriet's voice and manner in reading it who on the instant  she had finished desired I would give her leave to write his lordship an account of my health by that very night's postThis I absolutely forbad but in order to change the subject told her I would employ her in a more interesting correspondence and desired she would immediately write to you  I confess to you Fanny that Lord Lucan's letter has puzzled me so much that I sometimes think it impossible he could have been guilty of the insult I have charged him with and not attempted to have made some apology for itYet who else could have dared to enter my chamber or indeed who else was in the house at the time I am almost tempted to persuade myself sometimes that it was only a dream or vision that  alarmed meat other times my mind suggests some scruples to itself for not having acquainted Sir William with the affairBut then again in that case I must have hazarded my husband's and some other person's life dreadful though No let me rather suffer all that fate can inflict on innocence than be the cause of one man's death or misery  The moment that Lord Lucan left the house I felt as if a weight had been taken off my heartI have grown better every hour since and the company of my Lucy and Harriet makes me not regret the absence of any other person but yourselfFor heaven's sake my dearest Fanny no longer deny me and yourself the indulgence of sharing my heart and alleviating its anxieties you have now  nothing to detain you in England my brother will most probably stay abroad some yearsBut I will not say more for if your own inclination and my situation do not impel you I would not wish that my persuasions or intreaties should compel you  I have been three days about this letter and think it high time to conclude but must first acquaint you that the day Benson came here she discovered a private door in my chamber which leads to another apartment through which I conclude that Lord Lucan had made both his entry and retreat or else Sir William must have met him going out of my room at the time I faintedAdieu my Fanny I will write to you as soon as I get to  Southfield which will be at farthest in three days  Yours ever L BARTON  LETTER XXIV  Miss CLEVELAND to Lady BARTON  WHY must I tell my dear Louisa that the contents of her letter abated the pleasure I received from seeing that her hand had superscribed it this little circumstance gave me an idea of your perfect recovery while the same characters on the inside trace out a tale of unhappiness and distress and who can hope for health while the mind suffers  There is something very extraordinary in the adventure you have met with  at Waltersburgh but your surmise on that occasion does not appear to me to have the least foundationon the contrary I would almost hazard any bett that Lord Lucan was incapable of treating you with such disrespect It is impossible I think from the whole contour of his character to suppose that he could be guilty of such an outrage to decency and honour still more incredible to believe that he should never since have thought proper to offer any sort of excuse for such a behaviour especially as he proceeded so far as to frame an opportunity to himself for doing so by the  respectful freedom  of his letter to you for an action too which was so unfortunate in its consequences to the woman he lovesfor that he loves is but too obvious  Who then could it be That indeed I must be at a loss to answer any more than yourselfI am half persuaded and I wish I was intirely so that it was only a dreamBut be that as it may I think you were perfectly right in concealing the affair from Sir William as the knowledge of it must have been fatal at least to his repose and yours  I am very sorry that Sir William should have shewn more regret for the loss of his son than concern for your illness but parental fondness is I fear a stronger and more general affection in male minds than conjugal loveBut indeed my dear you deserve a little mortification for your false delicacy in concealing your situation from him so kiss the rod and have done  whimpering as we say to naughty children  I most earnestly wish that the business of parliament had not called Sir William from home at this juncture I long till he and you are settled in a domestic way at SouthfieldI own I am alarmed at a married woman's meeting with adventures of the novel kindin the absence of her husband  " The wife where danger or dishonour lurks  " Safest and seemliest by her husband stays  " Who guards her or with her the worst endures"  To say truth I think you in almost as much danger as our fair mother to whom these words were addressed for there certainly is a serpent in the grass somewhere  autour de vous  You have however the advantage of being warned of  your danger provided you construe the  billet  you sent me as its first  whisper  and as a woman's best safety is found in retreat I wish you would resolve to withdraw yourself from any further intimacy either with Lord Lucan or Colonel Walterbelieve me my Louisa they are both dangerous intimates though in a different way  I receive your congratulation as I am sure it is meant and though my mind is not yet strong enough to consider the discovery of Lord Hume's inconstancy as a subject for rejoicing at yet I agree with you that had this change in his affections happened after I had become his wife the misfortune would have certainly been more insupportable though I cannot even at present avail myself of  the resource you offer me of hating or despising a man whom I once lovedThe utmost I ever hope to arrive at is to be able to speak of my affection for him in the past tense only and the most effectual way to arrive at that end is to mention him as little as possible for the future I hope your next letter will inform me of your returning health and happiness I need the assistance of them both to support my present wretchednessMay they long attend my beloved sister sincerely prays her affectionate  F CLEVELAND  LETTER XXV  Lord LUCAN to Lord HUME  DEAR Hume I should be extremely pleased if I could like you consider the transformation of Ovid as a series of serious and natural events for as I have for some time past become extremely weary of my present form or mode of existence I should be inclined to flatter myself that any change must be for the better but the metempsychosis of Pythagoras would suit me still better than the metamorphoses of Ovid I should like to carry my identity with me into whatever being my spirit was appointed to animate as I think the consciousness of the sufferings I now endure would render any state except  that of a ferocious animal agreeable to me  But to be seriousI have been for some months past uncommonly wretched the fate of her who is the arbiter of mine hung for an age in doubtful ballance I never knew the extreme of misery till then for alas I had never before given myself leave to think she was mortal Yes Hume all that I love in life was near the grave and I sustained the shock like a philosopherI sighed and wept in secret while to the world I wore the specious mask of mere humanityThis was as much as I had power to do and he that says philosophy can go beyond this mark and teach us not to feel mistakes its use and makes dull apathy usurp its place  I don't know that ever I felt so much pleasure in writing as at this moment it certainly relieves our oppression to unburthen our hearts and you are my only confidantThis declaration may appear strange to you who know so little of the particulars of my attachment but when I affirm that no person breathing knows so much not even the dear object of it you may nay you must accept the title  From your last letter which I have read over several times I have collected two things which give me sincere pleasure but will surprise you extremely the first is that you endeavour to persuade yourself that you love Margarita much better than you really do and the second that you not only respect  and esteem but still love Miss Cleveland I hope you have written to her HumeEvery woman of worth and honour has and ought to have a proper pride neglect is therefore the most unpardonable of all offences that a man can commitI speak of men not brutes rudeness is of course out of the question  I was extremely diverted at the many ridiculous ideas you formed of the object of my passion but this be assured of and let it satisfy you that neither her mind or body have been perverted by any kind of art but that she is at this instant the most perfect work of the great and universal Artist that I have ever yet beheld though perhaps she may not have struck you for you have  seen her with the same idea of perfection  I perfectly agree with you that the word  happiness  has as many various meanings as there are tempers and constitutions in the world to confine it therefore to any taste passion or mode of life would be just as absurd as to drain your ponds that your fish may fly and flood your aviaries that your birds may swim Be it therefore unto you as you have wished it unto me that is as you choose itAdieu my dear Hume  Yours most truly LUCAN  LETTER XXVI  Lord HUME to Lord LUCAN  Venice  I Have often told you my dear Lucan that I never trouble myself to investigate causes for any thing that happens effects are enough for me so that whether your  transmogrification  be according to the Ovidian or Pythagorean system is of no sort of consequence for  transmogrified  you are to all intents and purposesYou may divert yourself with looking for the etymology of that  word  but though I don't believe you will be able to find its derivation in any dictionary it is a devilish good one for all that and truly expressive of my meaning  Why my dear metamorphosed friend you had nothing of the  Catullus  strain in you while you lived among us here But there are peculiar disorders incident to certain climates and an heavy atmosphere naturally makes people draw their breath in sighs Fly then for your life my dear patient and take the  air of the world  once more among us again before your ailment has confirmed itself into a Platonic asthma in the bogs of Ireland  You have puzzled me to the last line of a riddle by saying that I have often seen your Lesbiapr'ythee be good natured Lucan and tell me when and where for guessing is rather troublesome there can be no sort of danger in letting me know who she is as you are  already convinced that I don't like her or if I did may I perish if I would attempt to rival my friend with any woman breathing you may therefore be perfectly safe in making me a real confidant instead of a nominal one  Margarita and I have been here this fortnight and in that time we have contrived to lose a good round sum at play she thinks we have been overmatched by the Venetians and wants to try our fortune at Rome but I must wait for remittances from England before I can make this or any other experiment of the kind  You are mistaken Lucan I love Margarita most truly and what is much more extraordinary my affection for her  rather increases than abatesI have myself been made sensible of this tho' not in the most agreeable manner for I have lately felt somewhat of that hydra of calamities jealousyand this though I am perfectly satisfied that my sweet girl gave me no sort of cause on her part and would not quit me for an emperor  " Tell me my heart if this be love"  You are in some measure right with regard to my sentiments for Fanny ClevelandI certainly do most thoroughly esteem her and have given the strongest proof of my having an high opinion of her understanding by writing a very foolish letter acknowledging myself what I dare say your wise worship already thinks me a very silly fellowI don't know but as you say I may love her toothat is according  to your plan of loving  à la seraphique  but I have no idea of that sort of passion which can admit of a doubt or allow us time to reason about the why or wherefore of the matterLet me be charmed my senses captivated and let reason go to the schools if it will for I never found it of any use but to torment meI am all impatience for my remittances I don't like this place nor does Margarita though she has a number of relations here brothers and cousins by the dozen but they are all priests and I am apprehensive that some of these infatuates may persuade her to quit me and lock her up in a conventthe dear girl sometimes alarms me much by talking religiously but if I can get her to Rome once there will be an end of these fears for I am told that there is not even the shadow of devotion there  It is now two o'clock at noon and Margarita has not yet blessed my eyes I fear she is not wellI must go to enquire her health I hope your fair one is recovered do tell me all about her in your next Direct to me at Rome I forget where but to the care of your former Banker  Adio mio caro amico  HUME  LETTER XXVII  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  Southfield  THANK Heaven my dearest Fanny I have at last escaped out of that worse than lyon's den that detestable Colonel Walter's houseOn the  day after I wrote last to you as the weather was remarkably fine for the season I insisted on Lucy and Harriet's going out to take the air and in order to harden myself for my removal I ventured into the room adjoining mine which is a very large and handsome libraryBenson had told me that since the Colonel went to Dublin she had sometimes seen a beautiful little girl of four years old running about the house but that the child could not speak English and that the servants were extremely illnanatured to the poor baby who used to weep when she could not make herself understood that she was perfectly engaging in her manner and seemed to take a liking to Benson that she had enquired as much as was proper who the child belonged to and was constantly  answered that they knew nothing more of her than that she was one of their master's  importations  Upon this report I confess that I felt my relationship to dame Eve very strongly and desired Benson to bring the child to me the first opportunityShe accordingly led her by the hand into the library on the day I have mentioned but the moment the child saw me she would have fled and exclaimed in French O my papa will kill me I replied to her in her own language and assured her that no harm should happen to herShe smiled upon me and asked was I a Frenchwoman if I was she would love me dearly for all the people in this place she said were cross and cruel except her poor mama that she believed was  dyingShe then hid her face with her little hands and burst into a passion of tears  I need not tell you how I was affectedShe became instantly sensible of my tenderness and suffered Benson to lead her to me and set her on my knee but though she leaned her head upon my neck and seemed pleased with my caresses I could perceive that fear predominated over every other sensation by her eyes being constantly directed to the door and her appearing alarmed at every noiseI asked her where her mama was She paused for a few moments and then replied I was not forbidden to tell that she is above stairs lying upon her bed and that bed is on the groundWe don't lye so in France  The innocence and sensibility of her remark quite overcame meShe took my handkerchief and dried my eyes then said  "Don't weep pray don't you don't sleep upon the ground nor any one else I believe except my poor mama"  Again I kissed the lovely little pratlerI desired her to tell her mama that I should be glad to see herShe shook her head and said that was impossible for her mama was too sick to come out of her room but if she were well she must not disobey her papa and he had commanded her never to stir out while she livedThen said I my dear I will go up to herShe answered quick  "No no that cannot be the servants would tell my papa"  I asked her would she carry a letter to her mama she said yesI then asked her mama's name and she  answered D'OlivetI instantly sat down and wrote in French what follows  A Madame D'OLIVET  Madam  I have this day seen and conversed with your lovely daughter and from her innocent yet sensible discourse I have learned that you are ill and unhappyI have reason to apprehend that the treatment you have received from a gentleman of this country may naturally prejudice you against all its inhabitants but let me assure you that humanity and justice are the real characteristics of this nation and that if you stand in need of either you may depend on meeting them in the highest degree both from our manners and our laws  I beg leave now Madam to offer you any assistance that is in the power of an individual of your own sex of some rank and consideration in this country who will esteem it a very great happiness if she can be in any way serviceable to the injured or oppressed and who most solemnly assures you that whatever confidence you are pleased to repose in her shall never be made use of but to your own advantage as it is not curiosity but compassion that inclines her to interest herself in your concernsIf you think an interview with the writer of this proper please to contrive the means and she will most readily concur with your design as she is possessed of the sincerest inclination though unknown to you to do every thing that may be in  her power for your service and is with great truth your unknown friend  L BARTON  The child carried away the billet and returned in less than ten minutes to tell me that her mama had neither pen ink or paper but if I would be so good to let her have them she would write an answer immediately and in the mean time returned me a thousand thanks for the honour of my letterThe dear little Olivet took my hand kissed it and said she was sure she should love me for she thought I had done her mama good alreadyI immediately furnished her with my own  portefeuille  which contained all the necessary implements for writing and waited not without some degree of impatience to have this mystery  explainedLucy and Harriet returned from their airing soon after this adventure but I did not think it proper to mention the affair to them till I was more fully informed myselfI heard nothing farther of the child or her mother till I retired into my bedchamber and then Benson gave me a letter in French which I send you inclosed  To Lady BARTON  Madam  No words can adequately express my sense of your goodness to me but my gratitude shall while I have life be poured forth in fervent prayers for your happinessThis alas is the sole return that I can make to Heaven or to you whose blessed instrument I am sure you are to speak peace and comfort to a dying  wretch and smooth her passage from this vale of misery  Ah Madam may you never know the transports I received from reading your dear letter they can only be felt by one equally unhappy with me if such another wretch there be on earth who long denied the blessings of society debarred even the power of speaking to be understood should have an angel come and utter words of comfort and compassion  Forgive me Madam but I cannot help considering you as a superior being sent to the relief of misery like mine O may you think so too and ease my last sad moments of their sharped pangs It is not for myself I plead but for my innocent my unoffending child Receive a  more than orphan to your care and my last sigh shall waft my thanks to heaven  Even the short story of my misfortunes is much too long for my weak hand to write but if you will permit me Madam to throw myself at your feet when all the family are retired to rest and condescend to lend an ear to my sad tale I will relate it with the same truth and frankness as I would to my confessor you shall supply that solace long denied me and from your gracious lips I hope for absolution  I have now no terms to keep with Colonel Walter the hour approaches that must dissolve all the engagements that ever were between us how he has fulfilled his part of them Heaven and his  own heart can tell but even in my death I would not wish to offend him and were there not a much dearer concern than my own life at stake I would conceal his unkindness to the last moment of my existence would suffer my wrongs to be buried with me and sleep for ever in the silent graveBut my Olivia my lovely little babe pulls at my heartstrings and can I then decline the offer of your kindness and not strive to interest your compassion for her future fate impossible circumstanced as I am the mother must prevail over every other tyeI therefore again entreat the honour of being admitted to your presence this night I will come softly down the backstairs that join to the library and there wait till your woman shall conduct me to youIn the mean  time and ever allow me to subscribe myself with the most heartfelt gratitude  your ladyship's most obliged and devoted servant OLIVIA WALTER  Judge of my feelings at reading this letter by your own But though I know you will be displeased at my quitting the story here I must break off as the post is going out and I cannot send this without telling you that I have no remains of my late indisposition but weaknessPeace of mind and exercise will I hope soon restore my former strengthTomorrow my Fanny I will indulge you with the remainder of this affecting narrative till then  Adieu  L BARTON  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  LETTER XXVIII  THE moment I had read Mrs Walter's letter I sent Benson to wait her coming at the appointed placeAs some of the family were not yet gone to bed I had near half an hour's leisure to reflect on the uncommon villainy of Colonel Walter If this lady was his wife which I could have no doubt of from her taking his name how did he dare to propose marriage to Mrs Layton But this circumstance appeared trifling when compared to the inhumanity of his behaviour to the unfortunate Olivia and her lovely child At length Benson tapped softly at my door and I rose to receive  a being that seemed no longer an inhabitant of this worldFrom the child's account of her mother's illness I was prepared to see a person pale and emaciated but any thing so near our idea of a beautiful spectre never yet I believe struck mortal sight  I must describe her to youher stature is somewhat above the middle size but the extreme thinness of her figure made her appear still tallerher eyes are large and of the darkest blue her nose aquiline with the most beautiful mouth and teeth I ever saw her skin fairer than alabaster and so clear that one might fancy they saw the circulation of the blood which supplied a faint blushing in her cheeks resembling the inner tints of a white rose her hair of a light shining brown  flowed in loose tresses upon her shouldersher gown was a white silk polonese she had on a gauze hood tied loosely under her chin and a slight covering of the same sort upon her neck she appeared all form without substance spirit without matter and had she prophesied my faith would have listened as to an angel  As she entered my room she made an effort which I was not lucky enough to prevent to throw herself at my feetwhen I attempted to raise her from the ground I had not strength sufficient for she had fainted there with Benson's assistance and mine she recovered in about ten minutes then gushed into such a flood of tears as took away all power of  speech and almost suffocated her she often tried to speak and implore my pardon for the distress and trouble she had occasioned me and you may suppose that I said every thing in my power to calm her mind  As soon as she became a little collected she said it was joy not sorrow that had overpowered her weak frame the latter she had been too familiar with but the former was indeed such a long absent guest that it must be welcomed with some degree of transportIf the delicacy of her sentiments had needed any addition they would have received the highest from the sweetness of her voice and the uncommon beauty of her mouth while she uttered them  In order to restrain her acknowlegements for my interesting myself about her and her child I pressed her to relate her story and to account for the extraordinary appearances arising from her situation She bowed and proceeded with so much grace and elegance of expression that I could have hung with mute attention on her speech for a whole winter's night or a long summer's day and never wished her tale to have an end  The Story of Mrs WALTER  I had the misfortune to lose my father who had the honour of being a general officer in the king of Sardinia's service when I was but eleven years old his name was d'Alembergas he had many great and lucrative employments and my mother and he were both young  they indulged themselves in a thoughtless extravagance together at Turin during his lifeBut at his decease my mother no longer able to support the rank she had held at that court retired to Briançon to live upon the small patrimony which remained for her and me  Young as I was the loss of a fond father made a very deep impression on my mind and the perpetual affliction to which I saw my mother had devoted herself and which terminated her life in two years brought me full early acquainted with sorrow  After this irreparable loss I remained at Briançon under the care of an old maiden aunt of my father's who had lived too much sequestered from the  world and who ignorant of the nature of youth or how to guide it supplied the place of instruction with austerity never suffered me to be a moment out of her sight and was for ever extolling her own goodness and charity in being troubled with the care of my education and maintenanceIn short her manners were perfectly disagreeable and so extremely different from that delicacy and tenderness to which I had been too much accustomed that tho' I strove to respect her as my aunt I found it impossible either to love or esteem herThe affections of young and amiable minds cannot center in themselves and if they are not properly attached by the ties of affinity or kindness they will most probably bestow themselves on improper objectsThis was unluckily my case  The only person I was suffered to converse with except my aunt and that only at home was a girl about three years elder than myself whose mother had been formerly a servant to mine but at that time kept an inn at BriançonThis girl then as was natural I became extremely fond of and as my aunt grew every day more infirm and was often confined to her bed I found frequent opportunities of visiting my dear Nannette unknown to my severe guardian at her mother's house  In one of these till then innocent excursions my ill fate contrived that Colonel Walter should arrive at Briançon and stop at the house where I wasIt was summer the evening fine and as he had no company he sauntered into  the garden where Nannette and I were sitting at work in an arbourHe accosted us with great politeness and I could perceive that my companion was highly pleased with his addressBut the timidity natural to a person who had been brought up in so retired a manner as I had been made me wish to withdraw and notwithstanding his and Nannette's solicitations to the contrary I quickly returned home possessed with the first idea I had ever felt of having done wrong  I saw by the Colonel's appearance that he was an officer the recollection of my father struck forcibly into my mind and I blushed with indignation to think that general d'Alemberg's daughter had been seen in so improper a situation  My pride was however consoled by thinking that I should never see him again and I determined to be more guarded in my future visits to my friend  The next morning very early Nannette was at my bedside and expressed some degree of resentment at my having quitted her so abruptly the preceeding nightmy delicacy would not suffer me to hurt her pride by telling her my real motive for retiring I therefore said that it was owing to my apprehensions of being missed by my aunt but that I got off undiscovered and should not be so cowardly another time she seemed satisfied with this declaration and pressed me to come to her that evening She had an intire ascendant over me and notwithstanding the resolution  I had made a few hours before I readily promised to attend her  I had no doubt but that the Colonel would by that time have quitted Briançon and I would not venture to ask a question relative to him lest it might lead her to suspect my thoughts she however talked of him incessantly said he was the handsomest and most agreeable gentleman she had ever seen told me he had invited her mother and her to supper and behaved to them as if they were princesses and added she was glad he did not live in that country as she feared another interview might engage too much of her affections She rattled away in this manner till I was summoned to attend my aunt and then made me repeat my promise of going to  her the moment the old lady should retire to rest  My aunt was if possible more peevish than usual that whole day or at least her ill temper had a more than common effect upon my spiritsI longed for the evening to be released from her tyranny and to be indulged with the liberty of pouring forth my little sorrows in the bosom of my faithful Nannette  The moment that my aunt had dismissed me from her chamber I flew to my appointment without waiting to alter my dress which was a perfect deshabille and found Nannette in the arbour adorned with every little ornament that she was possessed of My  thoughts were too much affected with the disagreeableness of my own situation to make reflections on the gaiety of her appearance  I seated myself by her leaned my head upon her bosom and with a profusion of tears told her I was no longer able to bear the misery I suffered from my aunt's severityShe smiled and as I thought with an air of triumph told me that I might put an end to my misfortunes as soon as I pleased for that the Colonel had assured her he had visited all the courts in Europe and had never seen any thing half so beautiful as either she or IThat for her part she was resolved to try her fortune in the world forthwith and not stay moping at Briançon till she grew old and ugly  and that if I would accompany her she did not at all doubt of our success that I might hope to marry some reigning prince and that she might at least expect to be mistress of a dukedom  I was both shocked and surprised at hearing my friend talk in this extravagant and unusual stile but before I could express my sentiments Colonel Walter came into the arbour dressed as if he had been going to court on a gala dayI confess I was struck nay dazzled with his appearancefrom the time of my leaving Turin I had never seen any man finely or elegantly dressed before I now quickly perceived the advantages that Nannette received from being decked out and blushed at the inferiority of my own appearance  Every human creature has I believe some sparks of vanity in their nature and this was the fatal moment when mine were first kindled a desire of outshining Nannette who had a good deal disgusted me took immediate possession of my thoughts and my countenance was upon the instant lighted up with smilesI have not a doubt but Colonel Walter saw through the thin veil that covered the sentiments of a creature so young and artless as I was then he at least indulged my weakness even beyond my wishes by intirely devoting his whole attention to me and totally neglecting my companion  Olivia here broke off her narrative to apologize for entering into such minute circumstances which she said was meant  to convince me of her sincerity as she was very certain that her weakness and innocence were the ground works of her ruin  "But alas exclaimed she is there not indulgence and compassion due to uneducated uninformed fifteen"  I told her that her entering into those little traits of character those fine those delicate touches marked the master's hand and were a convincing proof of the goodness both of her head and heart She complimented me on my candor and returned to her story  There had been the most elegant repast provided that Briançon could afford Nannette and her mother the Colonel and I were all the party but I was the idol to whom all the incense was offered The good woman of the  house took the  ton  from her guest extolled my beauty and my accomplishments as extravagantly though not so agreeably as heNannette alone was silentIn short I became intoxicated with flattery and when the time of our parting drew near I secretly lamented at the same idea which had given me so much satisfaction the preceding nightthat I should see Colonel Walter no more  The Colonel insisted on attending me home and had ordered his chaise to convey me to my aunt'sBut though my vanity was flattered with this mark of attention I dared not indulge it with such an eclat however I said I would permit him to walk home with me provided Nannette would accompany usShe sullenly refusedI had  then no choice and the Colonel and I set out together  When we were about to separate I wished him a good night and a pleasant journeyHe threw himself at my feet caught hold of my hand swore I was the sovereign arbitress of his fate and that he would never leave Briançon till he had obtained my hand and heart but that if I cruelly refused to accept his love he would put himself to death that instant before me  Child as I was his transports terrified me I was also alarmed lest any of my aunt's servants should see him so I promised if he would then retire to meet him the next evening at the innHe made a merit of assenting to so  long an absence and after a thousand protestations of the most ardent passion and as many more tender adieus he left me plunged in such a fatal yet pleasing delirium as youth and experience only can feel What an infidel should I have thought the person who had at that moment warned me to discredit the sincerity of his profession The night passed away without sleep yet I thought it short and arose next morning even with unusual vivacityMy aunt's ill temper was no longer disagreeable to me my spirits were perfectly harmonized all was peace within and chearfulness withoutTowards evening I began to think that time lagged heavily in its course and wished for the setting of the sun as much as a benighted traveller for its rising  At length the welcome night arrived and set me free from my restraint I ran to my toilet to endeavour to adorn the few graces that nature had lent meIn vainconfusion interrupted my efforts and haste prevented my dispatch so that in a kind of despair I threw aside my few ornaments snatched up a little straw hat and set out on my adventures in the same careless deshabille I had appeared the night before  The moment I had got out of the view of my aunt's house I was met by the Colonel who received me with an extasy that I believe was then sincere we pursued our way to the arbour where he had first seen meOn my not finding Nannette there I endeavoured to quit him and go in pursuit of her but he  held my hand and entreated me to stay till he had revealed a secret to me which was of the utmost consequence to us bothHe then assured me that Nannette was not my friend and requested that I would not intrust her with the discovery he had made of his passion to me for that he feared she would betray the secret to my aunt and by that means deprive him of more than life the happiness of seeing me but that if I would be a little upon my guard she might suppose his attachment to be nothing more than common galantry which might possibly quiet the jealousy she seemed already to have conceived about it  I was shocked at the idea of deceiving or suspecting my friend yet the  gloom and dissatisfaction that appeared in her behaviour the night before made me too readily fall into this snare nay I joined in the deceit against myself by entreating that he would be more attentive to her and less particular to me on the present interview My motive for this request I solemnly declare was rather to prevent her being mortified as I saw she had been before than to remove any suspicion she might have entertained of meFor as I had perfectly acquiesced in the Colonel's honour and integrity as well as my own innocence I had not the least apprehension of any ill consequence in such a complianceThus did this artful man disjoin me from the only person who was likely to see through his designs and could have an interest in preventing my ruin  After this discourse and abundance of protestations of the tenderest affection we joined Nannette and the Colonel left us for some time together to try as I presume the strength of his power over meNannette was all gayety and shewed me abundance of presents that she had received from the Colonel My heart reproached me for concealing its sentiments from her but my promise to my lover had tied my tongue and the weakness and vanity of her conduct left me less reason to regret the mortification she must feel when she should know that he was seriously attached to me  This evening passed away less pleasantly than the formerNannette assumed a superiority over me in sense and judgment but attempted to soften her  selfsufficience by hinting at the difference of our years and experience and though this salvo did not render her behaviour less disgusting it deprived me of the power of resenting it and I retired home convinced that there were two passions awakened in my mind that I had never felt before love and hatred  Nannette and the colonel accompanied me homeAt parting he put a little billet into my hand which I could not refuse to accept without letting her know that it had been offered I was even then become the slave the abject slave of love and feared to offend my future tyrant The billet contained nothing more than a repetition of passionate and tender expressions with the warmest acknowledgments for the attention  I had shewn to his request by the prudence and propriety of my conduct and the most earnest entreaties to favour him with my company the next evening  I retired to bed and I hoped to rest but sleep was vanished and with it the charming delirium that had kept me waking the foregoing nightShort was the road that I had travelled in the flowery path of pleasure yet I already found it strewed with thorns I trembled at the danger of treading it alone and lamented more piously then than ever the loss of my dear mother to whom I might have confided both my hopes and fears upon this hazardous adventure  The usual hour of my rising arrived and found my eyes unclosed and my thoughts unsettled I had neither slept nor determined on any scheme for my future conduct and when my maid came into my chamber I stept out of bed burst into a passion of tears and said softly to myself I will not see the Colonelat least this day  I considered this determination as an amazing effort of resolution and fancied I had gained a complete victory over my infant passion The anxiety of my mind with loss of rest had brought on a slight degree of fever and the moment I quitted my aunt's chamber I retired to my own threw myself on the bed and desired my maid to leave me  The poor girl who loved me tenderly was alarmed at my situation and ran directly to Nannette to tell her I was ill and to beg she would come to meShe told her she was at that time so particularly engaged that it was impossible for her to stir abroad but that she would certainly see me some time in the evening  I knew nothing of this transaction and after having passed some hours in a disagreeable state of restlessness the agitation of my mind subsided and I fell asleepSome time after I was awaked by a light at my bedside and on opening my eyes I perceived Nannette and Colonel Walter disguised in womens cloaths standing by me the confusion which I felt both from my situation  and his is not to be expressedHe gazed upon me with such a look of ardent tenderness as covered me with blushes I turned my eyes away begged they would withdraw into another room and promised them that as soon as I had rendered my appearance decent I would wait on them  Nannette burst into a loud laugh at what she called my affected delicacy said she supposed every body was sometimes undressed and she did not see any occasion for making a difficulty about such triflesThe boldness of her manner while she spoke increased my distress and completed the dislike I had began to have conceived for herThe Colonel appeared infinitely more modest in his deportment and on his making a sign  to her to leave the chamber they both withdrew  The hurry of spirits which this unexpected visit had occasioned was increased by my apprehensions that some of the servants might detect the Colonel under his disguise and though I knew they all loved and pitied me yet I had been taught in my infancy to dread the putting myself in the power of a servant and never to let them know a circumstance which I wished should be kept secret  The moment that I entered the room where my guests were I entreated them to leave me and mentioned my reasons for wishing them goneNannette again made a jest of my scruples but the Colonel  treated them more seriously and asked my pardon for having brought me into any difficulty or distress by his indiscretion but pleaded both his and Nannette's anxiety for my health and insisted on my returning with them to the inn since he was certain from my appearance that I had not any complaint to prevent me  But not to detain you Madam longer with such tedious circumstances I half reluctantly complied with his entreaties and for about three weeks longer we spent every evening together almost in the same manner as the first  I had by this time lost all affection and esteem for Nannette and had now no confidante or friend on earth to whom  I could disclose the secrets of my heart but the single person in the world from whom I should most carefully have concealed them  When he had become quite certain of his empire over my affections he proposed my quitting Briançon with himhe said my aunt was too old and perverse to be consulted on such an occasion that he neither wanted nor desired any treasure but myself for that all other considerations were below his attentionhe added that his passion for me had detained him so long at Briançon that he was in danger of forfeiting his commission and his honour that if I loved him I ought not to hesitate about putting myself under his protection that our interests were now become one and that he would  defend me from every misfortune to the last moment of his lifeI believed obeyed and repented  Here she pausedfor this little reflection was followed by such a passion of tears that I was obliged to restrain my curiosity as you must your's for some timeI administered drops and water to my fair biographer and to you I recommend patience till the next post for my fingers are so tired that it is as impossible for me to proceed as it is to think or write upon any other subject till I have finished this therefore not one word shall I say of myself but that I am well that I long to hear from you and that I am most affectionately your's  L BARTON  LETTER XXIX  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  TAKE notice my dear Fanny that I am not used to narrative writing you must therefore make allowances for me and excuse my being sometimes too circumstantial and at others too diffuseI can only say that my translation is what all others pretend to be a faithful one  Perhaps it is so much the worse for that reason for while I am endeavouring to convey the minutest circumstances to you the elegance of expression which gave them consequence in the original is lostBut no matter for the manner of recitalif the story interests and affects you as much in the reading as it does  me in the writing I shall be satisfied with my own performance  As soon as the fair Olivia had regained her composure she proceeded thusWeak young and infatuated with passion as I was the Colonel's proposal of flying with him without marriage alarmed me and awakened all the sentiments of delicacy which are inherent to an innocent and virtuous mind yet that very delicacy prevented my having resolution to express my thoughts upon that occasionI feared to injure his honour by seeming to doubt itI therefore remained for some time silent upon this most interesting subjectHe repeated his entreaties and pressed me to determine  I replied that I would consult my confessor He had seen the various workings  of my mind and was prepared to evade all my scruplesHe objected instantly to my proposal by urging that a priest would oppose my marrying an heretic and endeavour to prevent it by acquainting my aunt but told me he had a particular friend a clergyman at Embrun who would make no difficulty of uniting us togetherThus did this artful man lull all my doubts to rest and soothe my unwary mind into a perfect dependance upon his honour fidelity and love  The night following was fixed for our departure and in an evil and inauspicious hour I ventured on a world unknown with the most inhuman and ungenerous of his sex for my conductorI had perhaps as little to regret at leaving Briançon as any young creature who ever  took so rash and unadvised a stepI wounded not the heart of a fond parent nor drew a pitying tear from any friendly eye I had no sister on whom my disgrace might be reflected nor a brother whose tenderness might lament or honour have resented my misconductI stood as it were alone in the universe was dear to no one but the loved object under whose protection I now had placed myself and in whom all the affections of my heart were centered  Yet notwithstanding this very peculiar situation my heart trembled and my eyes overflowed when I got into the chaise and every league that we traveled the dejection of my spirits increasedFor some time the Colonel endeavoured to dissipate my melancholy by the utmost  tenderness and I affected to appear more chearful in compliment to his attentionbut he soon roused my languor into resentment by taking some unwarrantable liberties which when he found I would not suffer he attempted to excuse by saying that he had already considered me as his wife  The moment we arrived at Embrun he left me in the inn to go as he said in pursuit of his friend the clergymanHe returned in about an hour with a person to perform the ceremony and we were married directly but without any other witness for I had thrown myself out of a situation to prescribe terms and must therefore have compounded for having my own scruples satisfied by a consciousness of my being his wife leaving  the opinion of the world to its own charity about me  We remained two days at Embrun and then set out for Marseilles during our long journey my husband told me that he had some reasons for wishing to change his name and that in compliment to my christian one he would be called OlivetI readily acquiesced in whatever he thought proper without attempting to enquire into the motives of his conduct We took a house at Marseilles and lived for four months in the utmost retirement and the most perfect happiness togetherI never stirred out but to church or to take the air with my husband every wish of my fond heart was accomplished and I secretly rejoiced that he no longer talked  of joining his regiment or returning to his native country  About that time his temper and manners began to alter he was frequently sullen and gloomy and if I attempted to enquire into the cause of this change he would answer Thou art and command me to leave himI obeyed and used to retire to my chamber and pass whole days and nights in tearsBut whenever he condescended to speak to me with chearfulness I instantly forgot his past unkindness and vainly flattered myself that it would return no more  At length with some appearance of tenderness in his manner he told me that he was under an absolute necessity of leaving me for a few months as my  situation would not admit of my travelling with him from my being far advanced in my pregnancy of Olivia but that he would certainly come back to me by the time I should be recovered from my lyingin and take me with him to Ireland where his estate lay  All that I had ever suffered in my life seemed slight to the misery of parting with him I knelt I wept and implored him not to abandon me under such circumstances He was unmoved by my tears and entreaties and in a few days afterwards quitted Marseilles without even bidding me adieuThe grief I felt from this separation would I hoped have terminated my life and I fear I should have been tempted to have shortened the date of my wretched existence  had not the tenderness which I felt even for my unborn babe restrained my hand from the too frequent effects of despair My situation was certainly deplorable and I then thought that my misery could not admit of additionI have been since but too strongly convinced that there are numberless gradations in wretchedness and that I was then but entering on my novitiate  I was so totally absorbed in sorrow at being forsaken by an husband whom notwithstanding his unkindness I both respected and loved that the common concerns of life never occurred to me till my maid came to ask me for money to support my family which consisted of two maids and a man servant I started as from a dream and in an agony  of grief ran to the Colonel's desk where I found twenty louis d'ors sealed up in a small box labelled thus  To OLIVIA D'ALEMBERG  THIS sum if used with care will bring you through your lyingin but you must immediately discharge two of your servants  J WALTER  Here again the fair mourner's tears interrupted her recital and must also put a stop to my translation for the present I wish extremely that I had finished the task I have undertaken for the sympathy between us is so strong that I feel my health wasting as her tale proceeds There is a story that some unhappy woman had blasted a great oaktree  once by constantly mourning her griefs beneath its shade This fable does not appear unnatural to me under my present sensationsAnd yet so sweet the poison is that I would rather have listened to her doleful ditty than to all the carols of the most festive mirth  What can be the reason of so unnatural a preference How oddly compounded is the human heart But most admirably framed surely for what appears to the vulgar to be its  contradictions  are in the language of philosophy but its  contrasts  only Its perfection consists in this as much as the harmony of nature depends on an opposition of elementsThe heat of fire the coldness of water the heaviness of earth and the lightness of air  You may observe that I take the advantage of every opportunity for  reflection  in order to guard my mind as much as possible from the danger of  thinking  I shall leave you to explain this paradox to yourself and am my dearest friend  your truly affectionate but unhappy sister L BARTON  LETTER XXX  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  MY dear Fanny I am now sitting down to conclude I hope the sufferings of my fair Narrator which I shall endeavour to do without any further interruption for though the listening to her story had a great deal of what I deem  the luxury of woe  in it I fear that this delicate sensation may have evaporated from the frequent breaks in the recital as much as the original spirit has in my translationbut at at all hazards I will now proceed  On perusing this shocking and surprising manuscript continued Mrs Walter  my head turned round and I had just presence of mind sufficient to convey it into my pocket before I dropt upon the floor The servants heard me fall and came to my assistanceHappy would it have been for me if they had spared their cruel officiousness and suffered me to have expired at that moment  My distress and despondency upon this occasion may appear unaccountable perhaps to others An husband's leaving his wife sometimes upon several occasions of business was not so uncommon a case as to have alarmed meBut there is a sort of praesentiment in the mind which often forebodes approaching ills philosophy must here be at a stand This circumstance cannot be accounted  for from nature as the present situation may have no sensible connection with the future events nor can such an effect be imputed to Providence neither without the impiety of supposing it capable of rendering us wretched before our time by giving us a hint of misfortunes to come without supplying us with the means of avoiding them  Besides did not the address of his billet the stiling me by my own sirname of d'Alemberg instead of Walter or even that of d'Olivet which he had artfully prevailed on me to assume during our residence together at Marseilles sufficiently evince that he no longer meant to consider me as his wife for the future This circumstance too supplied me with a strong reason also to suspect  that in reality I had no legal title to that claim as the unknown person who had so clandestinely performed the ceremony might not probably have been properly qualified by the orders of any church to have officiated in the marriage rites  It was perhaps no small aggravation to my misfortunes to reflect that had not my own indiscretion aided his dishonour I should not now have been so totally abandoned unjustified unfriended and unsustained to the sport of fortune to the mercy of a malignant censorious and unpitying world  Some days after this event I was lying on my bed in a state of stupid distraction when the sudden stopping of a  chaise at my door roused me from my lethargyI leaped off the bed and flew down stairs crying out he is returned my life my love my husbandBut judge of my astonishment madam when I saw Nannette enter the doorHer face was thin and pale but she appeared farther advanced in her pregnancy than I and seemed from the expression of her countenance to be at that instant in the pangs of labour  She accosted me with the grossest abuse called me vile deceitful wretch said I had seduced her husband from her that she was come to claim him and to cover me with the infamy I deserved alternately called for her dear Colonel Walter and implored assistance to save her's and her infant's life  Amidst the variety of passions which in those moments preyed upon my wretched heart compassion was the strongest I had her immediately conveyed to my chamber and placed in my own bed I sent for the bed assistance that could be had and in a few hours she was delivered of a son who lived but three days The agitations of her mind brought on a violent fever but even in her ravings she continued to accuse me as the sole cause of all her sufferings and uttered the most vehement imprecations against me  From the moment of Nannette's arrival I could perceive that my servants treated me with less respect than usual they doubtless believed her story and thought that my receiving her into my  house was at once a proof both of my guilt and fearThe physician and apothecary who attended her divulged the tale abroad and I was looked upon by the whole city of Marseilles as one of the most abandoned wretches  I know nothing that creates such an irksome sensation in the mind as imputed guilt but the very delicacy that makes us feel it most serves to restrain us from entering into a vindication as this would be to admit it possible at least it might be trueUnder such a difficulty I then laboured and this nicety supported by the natural courage of innocence inclined me rather to acquiesce in the censure than engage in so public a justification of myself as this unhappy woman's charge against me seemed to require  and she was not herself at that time in a fit condition either of mind or body to have listened to my defence  Nannette'sdelirium continued about fifteen days during which time the miserable pittance that Colonel Walter had left me was exhausted and I was seized with the pains of labour without being mistress of a single livre or credit in the place Death was at that time the supreme object of my wishes yet in regard to my dear babe that now approached the light I sent for my confessor related to him every circumstance that I have repeated to you implored his protection for the unborn innocent and put a shagreen case which contained the portraits of both my parents with some jewels into his hands which had been  bequeathed me by my dear mother on her death bed and which I had ever since preserved as a relic with the most pure devotion  Truth generally affords conviction to an ingenuous mind the good father heard my story believed it pitied my distress and gave me every consolation that my wretched state could admit of by administering the rites of the church and assuring me in the most solemn manner that he would take the utmost care of my child in case it should survive its unhappy mother I likewise recommended Nannette to his humanityHe promised that while she remained ill all her wants should be supplied and if she recovered he would furnish her with the means of returning home again to her mother  Peace once more took possession of my breast and a thorough resignation to the will of Heaven triumphed for a while over that distracting inquietude which had well nigh destroyed both my mind and bodyBut the arrow of incurable affliction was still lodged in my heart and the temporary calm that I then enjoyed was occasioned rather by my weakness than my strength  It pleased Heaven that I was soon and safely delivered of my beloved Olivia and from the moment of her birth all selfish apprehensions vanished I no longer felt a pang but for her and never ceased lamenting her being involved in the miseries of her mother Though doating on her as I did I a thousand times wished she had been born of any other parent  and yet am certain I would not have parted with her to a queen  In about ten days after I was brought to bed the good father who had supplied me with every necessary and visited me constantly came into my chamber with an unusual vivacity in his looksBe of good cheer Madam said he Providence never forsakes the virtuous and patient suffererHeaven has been pleased through my weak endeavours to raise you up a friend who is at once inclined and capable of relieving you from your distress and establishing a certain supply for your future competenceMadame de Fribourg will be here in a few minutes and is coming to take you under her roof and protection but before it is possible for you to remove  there I will inform you how this instance of good fortune has been brought about and furnish you with some instructions that may conduce towards rendering you agreeable to your patronessBut while he was yet speaking the marchioness de Fribourg entered and interrupted him  I have already told you that I had lodged Nannette in my own chamber and was of course obliged to lyein in my maid's roomThe first words the Marchioness uttered were Heavens what a place for the child of my friend my dear madame d'Alemberg She stept forward and embraced me then raised her glass to her eye and surveyed me with the most critical and distressing attention I was so extremely confused both by the suddenness and manner of her  entering and address that I could neither speak nor move  From the death of that dear mother she mentioned I had never seen a woman that was capable of inspiring me with respect or awe beforeher appearance commanded bothA sudden gush of tears relieved me for a moment and seemed to soften the  farouche demeanour  of my future benefactressShe quickly made an apology for having mentioned my mother seated herself by me laid aside her glass and took my hand with infinite grace but no softness  The marchioness was about fifty years old she was uncommonly tall had been remarkably handsome her eyes large black and piercing but the whole contour  of her countenance was rather hard than pleasingthere was an air of  fierté  expressed throughout her whole appearance that inclined you at first sight rather to fear than love her  She told me that my confessor who was also her's had informed her of my distress but that chance had brought her acquainted with my being the daughter of her friend that as such I might depend on her good offices and regard and added that she hoped I should be ready to set out with her in a few days for Paris where she was then going and that she would order her woman to provide a proper nurse to leave my child with  The idea of parting with my daughter shocked me extremelyI fell at her feet  and as if she had been the arbitress of my fate implored her not to divide me from my child said that this infant was now the only blessing I possessed in life and that nothing but death or her happiness should ever part us  She gazed at me with a mixture of surprise and contempt and said that if Pere Guillaume had informed her I was such a pretty simpleton she would have saved me and herself the trouble of a visit but that she believed there was something contagious in folly since she found herself inclined to comply with my absurd request though she detested children but that her hotel at Paris being large enough to prevent her hearing it squall I might bring the brat with me provided I did not insist on her being plagued with it during our journey  I was transported with even this uncouth and forced permission I kissed her hand and bathed it with my tears told her she had rendered me extremely happy and that I would endeavour to deserve her indulgence by every mark of gratitude and attention in my power She seemed pleased and somewhat affected and at quitting me she gave me a purse of fifty Louisd'ors bid me prepare for my journey by that day sennight said she would not desire me to come to her house at Marseilles because she meant to surprise her husband by finding me in her suite without his knowlege and desired that I might still retain the name of d'Olivet  This was the most sudden transition I had ever experienced from sorrow to  joy and tho' I could not possibly know what sort of state I was going to enter into yet I thought any change must be for the betterIt was also the first time I had ever had any thing like business to transact in my life and the having it in my power to discharge my debts and servants composed my mind into a state of the most pleasing tranquility imaginableNannette however remained still a weight upon my spirits in addition to that misfortune that then did and ever will oppress them  In a short time after the marchioness had left me the good father Guillaume returned he brought with him the shagreen case which I had intrusted him with the contents untouched except a diamond ring which he had been obliged to  dispose of to answer the expences of my family and delivered me twelve Louis d'ors the remainder of thirty he had sold it forThe sight of my dear parent's pictures affected me extremely I kissed and bathed them with my tears and most piously thanked my good patroness in my heart for this article of her bounty more than all the rest that she had saved me from the misery of parting with those dear remains  Father Guillaume told me that he had related my story to madame de Fribourg without mentioning who I was and shewed her the jewels in hopes that she would purchase them which she refused but the moment she beheld the portraits she snatched up one of them exclaiming with surprize and joy this this iswas  my near relation and my dearest friend Olivia d'Alemberg upon which he acquainted her with my name and family and she promised on the instant to take care of me but insisted on his not informing me that she had acknowledged any manner of affinity between us  He then gave me the marchioness's character and history in a few wordsPride vanity an insatiable desire of admiration and a fondness for play he said were her great foibles but that she was friendly generous and humane when these virtues did not interfere with her passionsHe said she had been married young to the marquis de Fribourg that he had been dead about ten years and had left her immensely rich that she had since married monsieur de Lovaine  a young soldier of fortune who treated her very cavalierly and of whom she was extravagantly fond and jealousHe told me that he had furnished me with this little  charte du païs  in hopes I should be able to steer my course by it to safety and happiness  He then informed me that he had written to a friend of his in Ireland to inquire after Colonel Walter but that as I had not been able to ascertain even the name of the province where his fortune lay it was possible nay probable from the dissoluteness of his character that I might never see or hear of him againHe intreated me therefore to strive wholly to forget him and devote my whole attention to the cultivation of the marchioness's friendship and the  education of my childHe promised to remember me in his prayers and to favour me with his advice by letter then took a most affectionate leave of me as he was obliged to quit Marseilles for a few days to perform some business by command of his superior  I had not seen Nannette from the time of my being taken ill but as I knew she was recovering though slowly I fancied I was then able to bear an interview with her and acquaint her with my design of quitting Marseilles I meant to offer her every assistance in my power and take leave of her I hoped for life  I accordingly proceeded to her chamberbut no words can express the surprise and horror that affected me at seeing  herHer whole frame was convulsed and every feature distorted and enlarged The moment she beheld me she seemed to acquire new strength and endeavoured to revile me with as much bitterness as when she arrived first at Marseilles  She had however no longer the power of raising any passion in me but pityI said every thing that was possible to calm her mind assured her I had never knowingly injured her and that I had certainly been as much if not more imposed on and deceived by Colonel Walter than herself  I then proceeded to relate with the utmost exactness the Colonel's whole behaviour from his first meeting to his  quitting me during the recital of which she wept often her countenance became more placid and composed and when I had finished my story she asked my pardon a thousand times for the injury she had done me and confessed I was much more to be pitied than herself on account of my youth and inexperience  She confessed too that the formalities of marriage had never passed between them but shewed me a paper he had given her by which he had engaged to acknowledge her as his wife at some future aera And with regard to the marked attention which he had shewn to me he assured her he meant nothing more by it than merely to deceive her motherand in order to carry on the plot said he was obliged to spend a few weeks at  Embrun upon a particular business and desired her to hold herself in readiness to come off to him there at a minute's warning on a summons which he promised to send her from thence  Matters being thus settled between them her mind she said was quite at ease on his departuretill she heard of my elopement with him the morning after it happened which threw her into a state of distraction for several months but not hearing from him all that time and beginning at last to apprehend that her situation would quickly discover her misconduct and cover her with infamy she determined to follow him to Embrun and as she could not suppose that he had ventured to have entered into firmer engagements with me than he had already  done with her she considered herself as having a prior right to the title of his wife and resolved to assert her claim  She then took a small sum of money from her mother to whom at length she had revealed the secret and came off post to Embrun as it had been known that we had taken that route but upon missing us there she had with almost incredible difficulty and after numberless delays attended by illness and fatigue on the way traced us to Marseilles where she acknowledged that she owed her life to my unmerited humanityshe then poured forth many severe excecrations against Colonel Walter said she would not return to Briançon but if she should recover would pursue him all over the world till she had received satisfaction  at least in revenge for his perjured faith and villainy  She told me that my aunt had not expressed either rage or surprise at my going off but seemed rather to be sufficiently consoled for my loss by being freed from the expence of my future maintenanceThere is a material difference between the belief and certainty of a factand though I had hitherto supposed that her insensibility might have prevented her from grieving at the impropriety of my conduct or the misfortunes which might probably attend it I could not bear to be convinced of my own insignificance by her inhumanityI felt humbled and mortified at this account as if I had received some fresh injury  Before I knew any thing of Madame de Fribourg I had many times thought of returning to Briançon of throwing myself at my only surviving parent's feet and of endeavouring to obtain her pardon for my offending self and her protection for my unoffending childBut now the idea vanished like a dream and I thought of no other resource but the marchioness's kindness  After having discharged all my little debts I had about thirteen Louisd'ors left and the day before I quitted Marseilles I took leave of Nannette and presented her with ten of them I begged to hear from her and left a line recommending her to the care of the good Father Guilaume and we parted from each  other with all the tokens and feelings of revived friendship  When the Marchioness's equipage stopped at my door I was ready to step into it and my little girl was consigned to the care of her woman who travelled in a chaise behind usMadame de Fribourg accosted me with great goodhumour and praised my exactness in not keeping her waiting The instant I opened my lips to reply to her politeness Monsieur de Lovain lifted up his eyelids which had been closed before and seemed to awake from a profound slumber he gazed at me with an expression of surprise in his look and threw me into as much confusion as his lady had done on out first interview  From that moment he became lively and so perfectly polite and attentive to the Marchioness that not only she but I was charmed with his behaviour and our long journey was rendered perfectly agreeable by the pleasing concord that appeared between as I then thought this happy pair  On our arrival at Paris the marchioness allotted me an apartment in her hotel and ordered two of her women to attend particularly on me and my child she requested that I would get the better of my  air triste  and appointed a musicmaster and a dancingmaster to instruct and fashion me  LETTER XXXI  Lady BARTON to Miss CLEVELAND  Southfield  AS I have now happily set the fair narrator down safe at the hotel de Fribourg you will give us both leave to rest ourselves a little for though I am still you perceive running on yet I find that a change of subjects relieves the fatigue of writing  While she was relating her story I felt infinitely more than you can possibly do in reading it the seeing the very object of distress before us is a vast improvement to the pathetic besides that along with my compassion towards her and my resentment against her husband there was mixed up a certain sensation of horror  at being lodged under the roof of such a villain  I honour Shakespeare for asking by the mouth of Lear  "Can there be any cause in nature for these hard hearts"  And am charmed with Sadi the great Indian philosopher for saying that  Il ne faut qu'un soupir de l'innocence opprimée pour remeur le monde  The extravagance of the eastern manner of expression cannot hurt the nobleness of the sentiment  We have heard nothing from any of the party since they left us nor have we been encumbered with neighbourly visits since our return homeBut our weather is fair our woods are dry our hearth and hearts are warm and Harriet Lucy and I find sufficient society  in ourselves to shorten the day and lengthen the evening being too loth to part at night  The next post I shall resume my narrative which may serve to divert us both from too close an attention to our own unhappinessTill then  Adieu  L BARTON  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
