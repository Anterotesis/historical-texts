 A  VINDICATION  OF PAINE'S "AGE OF REASON"  Price    s    d  A VINDICATION OF THE AGE OF REASON BY THOMAS PAINE BEING  An Answer to the Strictures  OF MR GILBERT WAKEFIELD AND DR PRIESTLEY ON THIS CELEBRATED PERFORMANCE  BY THOMAS DUTTON  AMICUS SOCRATES AMICUS PLATO SED MAGIS AMICA VERITAS  LONDON PRINTED FOR GRIFFITHS AND CO NO STRAND    A VINDICATION OF THE AGE OF REASON c  MANY and virulent are the Replies which have appeared to Mr Paine's  Age of Reason  It was not indeed to be expected that a work of this description which struck immediately at the very root of priestcraft should remain long unanswered No sooner was the challenge given than a "whole host of witnesses" started up in defence of that system from whence as Deme∣trius in a similar case observed to his colleagues at Ephesus they derive their wealth Men who had long been in the habit of fattening in luxurious ease upon the spoils and contributions of credulity bigotry and superstition were justly apprehensive lest the investigation of truth should at length open the eyes of the community at large and discover in all its na∣kedness the fallacy of that system by virtue of  which they domineered over the souls and con∣sciences of mankind and which "brought no small gain unto the craftsmen"  Hence the Age of Reason no sooner made its appearance than the  toosin  of alarm was sounded throughout the whole Hierarchy Re∣ligion was now declared to be threatened with as great and even greater dangers than those which were supposed at a former period to me∣nace the state in consequence of the publication of the  Rights of Man  Every disgraceful epi∣thet of abuse was conferred with liberal hand upon the author the titles of Deist Atheist In∣fidel the Apostle of Beelzebub the Agent of Lu∣cifer with an infinite variety of the like op∣probrious terms now succeeded to the appel∣lations of Jacobin Leveller Anarchist Revolu∣tionist Rebel c which had formerly been given to Mr Paine on the score of his politics Not only the clergy of the established church but the leading men of every religious sect had equal interest at stake and were equally concerned in providing an antidote against the baneful influence of this deleterious poison for the moment the way to God was laid open to every man alike the moment neither  masters of the ceremonies  nor  court etiquette  neither  priests nor religious formswere necessary to introduce man to his Maker that moment they readily foresaw must inevitably put an end to their lucrative traffic and totally anni∣hilate the vast revenues they received for acting as ambassadors of Christ and instilling into the minds of the people spiritual knowledge and heavenly comfort Replies Answers and Re∣futations of the Age of Reason and its  diaboli∣cal  doctrines were therefore published in abun∣dance many of which however by their futi∣lity and total want of argument have produced the very reverse of that effect which their respective writers hoped to bring about in∣asmuch as their incapacity to refute the doc∣trines they attacked served at once to show their own imbecility and the impregnable strength of the fortress against which their puny efforts were directed  It cannot be expected nor indeed will the limits I have prescribed to the present work permit it that I should enter into a minute elaborate examination of every petty Reply to which the Age of Reason has given birth Their name may truly be denominated  Legion  "for they are many" and a serious refutation of some of them is perhaps a moral impossibility The  wild incomprehensible ravings of a Hunting∣ton and other mystical writers are beneath the dignity of Criticism and to cope with such men with the weapons of sound argument and plain reason would be to adopt the language of their favourite Apostle "fighting like one that beateth the air"  For these reasons I shall confine my strictures chiefly to what I conceive the two most res∣pectable publications that have appeared in our language on this interesting subject These are AN EXAMINATION OF THE AGE OF REASON by Gilbert Wakefield and AN ANSWER TO MR PAINE'S AGE OF REASON by the celebrated Dr Priestley  Both these gentlemen appear to agree nearly in their religious as well as in their political sentiments and yet the manner in which they conduct their attack upon the Age of Reason furnishes a striking contrast Mr Wakefield but too often indulges himself in a spirit of acrimony which if not downright illiberality borders I am sorry to say immediately upon it He acknowledges in the very outset of his career that  the Work which he has under∣taken to examine see page is entitled to particular respect not only from the genius  of the Author but also from the singular circumstances of its composition  but he soon loses sight of this respect and descends to invective and abuse  See pages But I shall have occasion to remark more largely upon this topic in the course of the work  which are quite un∣worthy of the high literary reputation Mr Wakefield deservedly enjoys The field of literary dispute we apprehend lies open to every man but let him wield none but lawful weapons even truth and sound argument and not turn the sacred  Academic Grove  into the sanguine  Field of Mars  Another objection I have to the general cha∣racter of Mr Wakefield's Work is the strong vein of  egotism  which pervades many parts of it Mr Wakefield contemplating himself as  a delicate bird delighting in strawberries and the choicest fruits  see page may bridle his neck and survey with fond selfcomplacency his gay plumagemay hold in sovereign con∣tempt Thomas Paine and every other author who by differing from him in opinion mani∣fests himself to be  a crow who prefers car∣rion and putrescence and finds a feast in a  rotten carcase  but surely he might have modestly left his readers an opportunity of draw∣ing this flattering comparison in his favour  "Ad populum phaleras"  to imitate Mr Wakefield's constant practice of introducing quotations from Latin and Greek authors on the most trifling occasions  In justification of this remark the reader is referred to the following pages of Mr Wakefield's work where he will find quotations heaped upon quotations with all the pompo∣sity and affectation of a schoolboy See pages In many of these passages Greek and Latin authorities are brought forward in support of the most palpable the most plain trite and if I may be allowed the expression the most everyday observations imaginable I am far from objecting to classical quotations introduced with judgment and with a sparing hand but when dealt out with extravagant profusion when they stare you in the face at every turn where neither the subject nor the point∣edness of the allusion justify their insertion they certainly betray a pedantic disposition unworthy any gentleman of established character in the republic of letters And this re∣mark I make the rather as the general outcry raised against Mr Paine on the score of his being unversed in what are generally styled the learned languages seems to have led several of his opponents into this error and I am convinced that many an author has thereby acquired credit with unin∣formed minds for a greater portion of learning than he was justly entitled to  a practice which  though it may serve to impress the common class of readers with a stupendous idea of the Author's learning has in the eyes of men of sense an air of pedantry that more than any thing else has contributed to bring the name of scholar into disrepute  Quite the reverse is Dr Priestley's mode of proceeding in this literary warfare He con∣ducts himself with becoming dignity argues in a fair candid and manly manner never descends to personalities but confines himself strictly to the subject of dispute which he treats with great ingenuity and at the same time with a plainness which forms as I before observed a striking contrast to the ostentatious display of learning exhibited by Mr Wake∣field  One observation more I must beg leave to premise before I enter upon my intended  Vin∣dication of the Age of Reason  in the aggregate to wit that I do not set out and I hope I shall not fall into this error in the course of my dis∣quisitions with a predetermination to defend my author at all events whether right or wrong or to vindicate indiscriminately every posi∣tion laid down by Mr Paine because I have once been induced to take up the cudgels in  his defence or as though I deemed every as∣sertion advanced by Mr Paine infallible On the contrary I propose to treat the subject with due candour and much as I admire the general purport of the work under consideration shall readily subscribe to the justice and validity of any censure bestowed upon particular passages and such passages I am well aware there are where hardy assertion and specious sophistry supply the place of sound argument and know∣ledge It is not the personal cause of Mr Paine but the cause of what I conceive to be the Truth that I wish to espouse from the free discussion and investigation of which no consideration upon earth ought to deter a rational being To inves∣tigate and boldly avow the Truth as far as the measure of reason wherewith we are endowed by the allwise Author of Nature enables us to ascertain it is a duty which man owes both to himself and to society at large and whoever shrinks back from the task whoever neglects to discharge this part of his moral obligations is either a  traitor  or a  coward  I proceed now to an examination of the work I have undertaken to defend  After briefly stating the reason which induced him to anticipate the time he had originally pro∣posed  to himself for the publication of his reli∣gious sentiments Mr Paine proceeds to a sum∣mary recapitulation or confession of his creed This may be said to consist of two partsthe one positive the other negative To the former part the staunchest advocate of Christianity I apprehend cannot have the smallest objection to make it accords with th  enets of every religious denomination in the  sent Christian world that has come within my knowledge it professes a belief in one God a hope of hap∣piness beyond this life inculcates the natural equality of man which in the sense  re im∣plied the proudest upstart of aristocra  will not I flatter myself take upon him to deny and concludes with a definition of religious du∣ties which may be considered as a concise but energetic comment upon the golden rule  Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you  With the second or negative part the case is widely different Here Mr Paine attacks with one bold decisive blow the whole order of Priesthood of every religious system from the times of Moses to the present day and not only the Priesthood but the followers and dis∣ciples of every religion and sect that does or  ever did exist in the whole world His words are these  I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church by the Roman church by the Greek church by the Turkish church by the Protestant church nor by any other church that I know ofMy own mind is my own church  All national institutions of churches whe∣ther Jewish Christian or Turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit  This may be considered as a general chal∣lenge to the zealous sticklers of every church establishment From such therefore we must not look for a ready assent to this part of our Author's creed The doctrines of faith what∣ever the religion may be in which we are edu∣cated whether the Jewish Christian Turkish or Pagan systems forming generally speaking the first lesson instilled into the infant mind at a time when the reasoning faculties may be almost said to lie dormant naturally make a deep im∣pression and being familiarised to us by con∣stant repetition we adopt them without exami∣nation we receive them upon trust subscribe to them as a matter of course and if after∣wards  as we advance in years and our reason attains to its proper growth we are led to weigh to prove and examine the religion we profess which by the bye is not done upon a very moderate calculation by one in ten thou∣sand we have unfortunately exclusive of the task the arduous task of separating Truth from Error a powerful host of prejudices and assump∣tions to combat with For my own part I am free to confess that this blind acquiescence in the opinions of others this easy indifference with which mankind in general sit down con∣tented with the religion of their ancestors whether Jews Christians Turks or Pagans furnishes in my mind no mean argument against the truth of any of them or in other words against their divine origin A religion professing to be derived immediately from the Almighty and written by divine inspiration ought to flash conviction in the face of every one who hears or reads it But this we do not find to be the case with any known religion in the world Add to this that I do not see that peace morals social order and the rights of humanity are better respected and maintained under governments professing the Christian faith than where the blindest Idolatry prevails  Nay I am bold to assert that the remote and Pagan empire of Japan might in this respect furnish a pattern for the most enlightened and religious state if a  religious  state there be in Christendom  See some excellent remarks upon this subject in the fourth Volume of the Chevalier Thunberg's Travels pub∣lished this year by Messrs Rivingtons of St Paul's Church∣yard  But this is a topic which I pro∣pose to discuss more fully when I come to treat of the intimate connexion between religion and morals on which occasion I shall not omit to say a few words on the stale but just maxim as Mr Wakefield very properly terms it and which he accuses Mr Paine of having most egregiously violated  ab abusu ad usum non valet consequentia  Meanwhile I cannot but remark upon the ready acquiescence with which Mr Wakefield subscribes to every part of our Author's creed that makes in favour and I might emphatically add  as far  too as it makes in favour of his own political creed  "All national institutions of churches" writes Mr Paine  whether Jewish Chris∣tian  or Turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit  How eagerly does Mr Wakefield who probably in consequence of his unfortunate schism from the doctrines of the established Church of England sees no prospect of ob∣taining the  mitre  subscribe his  Yea  and  Amen  to this just remark  concisely and pregnantly expressed  He immediately becomes more violent in his reprobation than our Author himself and launches out into a general in∣vective against  national churches  without the smallest discrimination or exception  National Churches  see page are that  hay  and  stubble  which might be removed without any difficulty or even danger of con∣fusion this  ipse dixit  assertion of Mr Wake∣field by the bye will I fear by the venerable bench of bishops be pronounced equally  hardy  with any with which he taxes Mr Paine  See page of Mr Wakefield's Work    from the fabric of religion by the gentle hand of Reformation but which the infa∣tuation of  ecclesiastics  will leave to be de∣stroyed  by fire National Churches  are that impure incrustation which has envelloped by gradual concretion the diamond of  Chris∣tianity  nor can I fear for the reason just now stated the genuine lustre be recovered but by such violent effort of restitution as the separation of substances so long and closely connected must inevitably require  The happy simile of  hay  and  stubble  in this beautiful conglomeration of metaphors we find is taken from the first Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians where the apostle speaks of a build∣ing to be raised and from his boast of having himself wrought as a wise  masterbuilder  upon the foundation it should seem that the erection of this building was a work of use and necessity Now if the words of the apostle have any re∣ference at all to  national establishments  we ap∣prehend that the  hay  and  stubble  must apply to corrupt establishments that will not stand the test such for instance as the Church of Rome in the eyes of the Protestant clergy and which therefore are threatened with destruction by  fire  whilst the  gold  the  silver  and the  precious stones  as for the  wood  I do not insist upon that but will give it to Mr Wakefield to share the fate of his  hay  and  stubble  by a parallel chain of rea∣soning  may be supposed to designate and point out a pure uncorrupted establishment cleared from the errors and superstitions of the Church of Rome such as our divines pronounce the pre∣sent national Church of England to be And as by the  fire  which the apostle tells us is doomed to try every man's work the awful phaenomena and awards of the day of judgment are generally understood to be meant in which day the  ele∣ments shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein of course the  hay  and the  stubble  shall be burnt up  Pet iii v    we are very sorry to think that Mr Wakefield has no nearer prospect of getting rid of this selfsame worthless  hay  and  stubble  and sub∣stituting his  gold  and  silver  and  precious stones  in their stead than at the very moment when the end of all things shall take place  Were I as ready to lay hold of every oppor∣tunity of finding fault with Mr Wakefield's expressions as this gentleman appears to be in the case of Mr Paine I might possibly dis∣cover a  flaw  in his  Diamond of Christianity  which to quote his own words  the impure incrustation of  National Churches  has by gradual concretion enveloped to that de∣gree  that the genuine lustre cannot he fears be recovered but by such violent effort of restitution as the separation of substances so long and closely connected must inevitably require  Now if we compare the religion founded by Christ to a Diamond and I take it for granted that every sincere believer and professor of it must regard it in this light as a jewel of the first water as  the pearl of great price more precious than the golden wedge of Ophir  it seems no more than fair to conclude that this Diamond was not put into our hands by the Almighty in its rough incrusted state for man to cut and hack at pleasure such an idea would indeed fall little short of blasphemy but rather in a state of the utmost purity po∣lished to the highest degree of perfection and like the God from whom it professes to origi∣nate without spot or blemish A diamond in this state once separated from its incrustation and properly polished might we apprehend venture to defy all the impurities in nature and could perhaps never be incrusted over again either by sudden or gradual concretion inasmuch as the hardness of its substance added to the finished polish of its superficies would  resist the impression of every foreign body that had a tendency to sully and debase it And therefore as Mr Wakefield's  Diamond of Christianity  has according to his own confes∣sion lost its purity and polish by the impure incrustation of  National Churches  we cannot class it among the genuine productions of Gol∣conda's mine but rather conceive it to be a kind of  factitious  or  mock diamond  a kind of com∣positionwork like the  faux brillants  or  Temple Diamonds  which crafty and interested jew∣ellers so well know how to palm upon their credulous customers for the genuine produce of Golconda or Peru  Again let me put the question to Mr Wake∣field how he can consistently with this gene∣ral and furious invective against  all national establishments  speak so highly of the  Jewish Dispensation  See page where Mr Wakefield says  Though we concede to Mr Paine that  the way to God was open to every man alike  we affirm of the  Jewish  and  Christian  dispensations that  they  only were  this way  to any man desirous of entertaining rational notions of God and human duty  which we apprehend was to all intents and purposes a  national church  in the  strictest sense of the worda church dressed out with far more "  trumpery  Let any unprejudiced reader peruse the books of Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy let him peruse the description of the Jewish Festivalsthe feast of trumpets the feast of tabernacles the feast of the new moon the feast of passover the feast of the Sab∣batical year the feast of jubilee the feast of atone∣ment c c c with all their concomitant pomp and pageantry let him read the description of the ark of cove∣nant the altar of incense the table of shewbread the golden candlestick the dresses of the priests the ceremo∣nies and formalities to be observed in the various offerings rites c ordained by the Levitical law together with the severe penalties annexed to neglect or disobedienceand if after a candid perusal of all this he does not find as much  trumpery  in the Jewish worship as in that of the established church of England or of Rome or of the Greek church or of any other church I know of I will acknowledge myself guilty of the most unpardonable error and injustice in the character I have just given of the Jewish dispensation  " to make use of Mr Wakefield's own expression in allusion to the church of England and a hundred times more oppressive and despotic than any national Church we know of in the Christian world If Mr Wakefield thinks it a sore and grievous hardship that a difference in certain points of doctrine termed  Articles of Faith  from the tenets of the established church of England should debar a man from the  privileges  of  preaching in the pale of that particular church must it not appear much more arbitrary and unjust that a man assenting in every respect to the religious tenets of the Church should be incapacitated from exercising the sacred functions of the priesthood on no other score than some personal deformity or casual defect under which he unhappily labours such for instance as a  Leviticus xxi  flat nose an unfortunate lame∣ness in the hands or feet  Admitting that the  Gout  under the Mosaic dispensation would have furnished sufficient ground for disqualifying a man from the discharge of the priestly function and supposing these inhibitions to be in force under the present system of things it is lamentable to think what an irreparable loss the poor sheep of Christ's flock must inevitably sus∣tain through the disqualification of such numbers of their most valuable and eminent pastors whose faithful care and tending the wretched sheep would of course be depri∣ved of by the persevering spite of a disorder which seems to take a kind of cruel pleasure in attacking the votaries of luxury and sloth insomuch that it is now generally consi∣dered as the certain appendage of indolence and high living and to which therefore the higher orders of the clergy that is to say the chief shepherds and pastors of the flock the bishops deans c are in consequence of their large revenues the most exposed  a crooked or hump back a diminutive stature a squint or cast in  the eye an impure habit of the blood or a scro∣phulous eruption or lastly a certain misfor∣tune to which the priests of the present day are perhaps ten times more exposed in conse∣quence of the prevalence of a certain fashion∣able disorder than they seem to have been in the times of Moses Must not I say misfor∣tunes and calamities like these furnish in the eye of every sensible and dispassionate enquirer a far weaker argument for excluding a man from the sacred function than an avowed schism from the religious tenets of the church whose minister he desires to be Unless indeed as probably may be the case Mr Wakefield has an eye to the  loaves and fishes  and provided he is indulged the privilege of  eating  of the  shewbread  Levit xxi  and  partaking  of the  Holy  and  Most Holy  will readily consent to turn the sacred office into a  sinecure  But lest the above remarks which have only in view to point out the inconsistency of Mr Wakefield's arguments and the readiness with which he attempts to throw the blame of all the corruptions which according to his own  confession have crept into religion upon the shoulders of the established church instead of tracing them back to their true source the very principles of Christianity itself as we shall in the sequel endeavour to show lest I say the above remarks should lead to misconception and render me suspected of being the secret or avowed advocate of any one particular churchestablish∣ment whatever I take this opportunity of tes∣tifying my full and hearty execration of them all in the concluding words of Mr Paine's creed  All national institutions of churches appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and mo∣nopolize power and profit  In proof of which assertion if a selfevi∣dent axiom like this plain as the sun in its me∣ridian splendour can require any proof I need only refer my reader to the uniform practice of priests through all ages and in all countries from the sons of Eli who could not keep their  threepronged fleshbooks out of the seethingpot while the meat was boiling  to the good shep∣herds of the present day who if the unfortu∣nate sheep are already so closely shorn that they cannot yield wool sufficient to discharge the fees  of office make no scruple for their  mouth is always open and their heart enlarged  Cor vi  of excommunicating them at once from the pale of the church and the benefits of salvation I need only refer them to the page of history for the vast estates taken from the church under our pious Defender of the Faith Henry VIII of England to the more recent events of the French Revolution and the immense treasures which the church has been made to refund in a neighbouring nation I need only refer them lastly to the eagerness with which people of all descriptions strive to get into sacred orders an eagerness which in some countries and espe∣cially in Spain is carried to such an incredible excess that the number of pastors and shep∣herds seems to be in a fair way of rising to par with the sheep of the flock over whom they are by divine grace and the express calling of God appointed to preside  Leaving however the clergy for the present at least in the full exercise and enjoyment of their  sacerdotal privileges  that we may not "muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out  the corn"  Cor ix and sqq  and certainly as long as we con∣template ourselves as  Christ's Vineyard  it is no more than just that these  Husbandmen  should " have power to eat and to drink" for "  prun∣ing  and  lopping  us or viewing ourselves in the light of  God's husbandry  Cor iii we must allow the  labourer  that  ploweth  and  thresheth us  in hope Cor ix to be worthy of his hire  leaving I say the "Clergy and those that  wait  at the altar to be  partakers  of the altar to  reap  of our  carnal  things in return for the  spiritual  things which they have  sown  unto us and to  fatten  on the things of the temple  I recur to the text of my author  Every national Church or religion has established itself by pretending some special mission from God communicated to certain individuals The Jews have their Moses the Christians their Jesus Christ their Apostles and Saints and the Turks their Mahomet as if the way to God was not open to every man alike  It is at this passage that Mr Wakefield may be said to commence his attack upon our author  Hitherto we have beheld him subscribing with the readiest acquiescence to every position advanced by Mr Paine but he now takes up the cudgels with a vengeance and boldly de∣clares Mr Paine's statement to be  not only vague and frivolous but nonsensical and erroneous in the extreme  In support of this assertion Mr Wakefield presents us with a species of argument which I have not the smallest hesitation to pronounce infinitely more  vague and frivolous and erroneous  than one half of the statements in Mr Paine's book which his antagonist without any show of reason declares to be  not only the  essence  but the very  quintessence  of all weakness and absurdity  The system of Jesus Christ Mr Wake∣field writes page proceeds upon the very supposition here instituted as in direct contradiction to it that the way to God  is  open to every man alike which  might  be proved as every body knows by many pas∣sages of most explicit purport in the  Christian  scriptures  Nothing can well be more vague and incon∣clusive than this mode of reasoning Mr Paine says and says truly for all historical evidence  is decidedly on his side that every national religion has established itself by pretending some special mission from God communicated to certain individuals and this palpable asser∣tion Mr Paine supports by instancing the ex∣amples of the founders of the Jewish Christian and Turkish religions who certainly  did  for we have their own words for it if any faith may be placed in the written biographies of these heavenly messengers lay claim to  divine delegation  Surely Mr Wakefield cannot mean to call facts of such historical notoriety in question when he pronounces our author's statement to be "frivolous nosensical and erroneous" Hi  cen∣sure therefore if it have any weight at all must apply to the inference our author draws from this statement that the very act of granting a divine mission to any favoured individual or admitting such a mission to be granted is in itself a plain though tacit acknowledgment that the way to God is  not  open to every man alike" but that we stand in need of  mediators plenipotentiaries advocates  and  ambassadors  to transact our busi∣ness and arrange preliminaries for us and that God is really a consuming fire Deut iv Heb xii dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto Tim vi but  only through the  medium  "And all the people saw the thunderings and the light∣nings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off And they said unto Moses Speak  thou  with us and we will hear but let not  God  speak with us lest  we die  " Exod xx So likewise in Deut v et sqq The Israelites are represented addressing themselves to Moses to act as their  agent  and  plenipotentiary  with God "Now therefore why should we  die  for this  great fire  will  consume  us If  we  hear the voice of the Lord our God any more then shall we  die  Go  thou  near and hear all that the Lord our God shall say and speak  thou  unto us  all  that the Lord our God shall speak unto  thee  and  we  will  hear  it and  do  it"  of these privileged agents or proxies who are empowered to treat and act for us on all occasions by  procuration  To the divine mission of  Moses  and  Jesus Christ  Mr Wakefield himself bears testimony in the most unequivocal terms  Our inference from these indubitable posi∣tions see page is clearly  some  degree of supernatural communication which we style  Revelation  to the founders of  Judaism  and  Christianity Moses  and  Jesus  Moses we are assured and it is allowed by the Jews themselves was but a man as we are however highly favoured and distinguished  by the Almighty according to scriptural ac∣count So was  Jesus Christ  likewise accord∣ing to Mr Wakefield's creed  That  Creed  of  Christian churches  writes Mr Wake∣field page which acknowledges  Jesus Christ  to be  God  one by his own confession like ourselves and subject to all the constitutional weaknesses of mortality to pain and death that creed I say is a fundamental violation of all theology a most gross and hideous doctrine alike unknown to the  Heathens  here Mr Wakefield is guilty of a most gross and palpable error as any one in the least degree con∣versant with the Heathen mythology will immediately per∣ceive  and the  Jews  and contemplated with abhorrence by the followers of  Moses  from its first propagation to this very day a doctrine inconsistent with the plainest re∣peated declarations of Christ himself and his apostles a doctrine which no  human  testimony whatever could render credible for a moment because a contradiction to  divine  a doctrine which must ever shock and disgust unprejudiced and disinterested examination and which therefore will happily prove a millstone on the neck of all  politi∣cal  establishments of  Christianity  and whelm them in perdition  And this denial of the divinity of Christ Mr Wakefield further enforces by one of the most  pointed  and  elegant  quotations we ever remember to have seen brought forward the insertion of which bears unquestionable evi∣dence to the  delicacy  of Mr Wakefield's taste though our "delicate bird" seems in the present instance it must be owned to have lost sight of his "strawberries and choicest fruits" and to be roving near the sink of  rottenness and putrescence  and yet he  boldly charges Mr Paine with error and ab∣surdity and asserts that the  Christian system  pre∣supposes that  the way to God  is  open to every man alike  whereas the very reverse may easily be proved  by many passages of most explicit purport in the Christian scriptures  and by the express declarations of Christ him∣self If the way to God  be  actually and of a truth open to every man alike which it no doubt is though priests would fain persuade us to the contrary why does Christ who himself according to Mr Wakefield's doctrine was but a mere  man  arrogate to himself the exclusive right and power of granting  passports  to man∣kind to  walk  in this way  No man cometh unto the Father but by  me  John xiv Why does he in the same chapter and verse declare  himself  to be  this way  Why does he roundly assert that man can have  no  knowledge of the  Deity  but through  his  revelation  No man knoweth the  Father  save the  Son  and he to whomsoever the  Son  will  reveal  him  Matt xi Wherefore are we directed  by his apostles to look up to Christ as the  me∣diator  of the  new covenant  Heb xii through whose blood a  new  and  living way  has been opened unto us into the holiest of all Heb x  Through whom we have  access  unto the Father  Eph ii and iii Rom v who is our  "advocate"  with God John ii and  who ever liveth to make  intercession  for us  Heb vii To what purpose can all these admonitions all these exhortations tend if the system of Jesus Christ proceeds as Mr Wakefield assures us it positively does proceed upon the supposition that  the way to God  is  open to every man alike  Why are we then directed to look up to Christ or to any other man as our only hope of eternal life and happiness with the denouncement of a terrible curse an everlasting  Anathema Maranatha  against us if we do not believe in this author and finisher of our faith as Christ is emphatically styled Heb xii Can this let me put the question to every can∣did and impartial enquirer can this be recon∣ciled with Mr Wakefield's hardy assertion that the way to God by the Christian system  is  thrown open to every man alike Certainly it cannot and therefore the charge of error in∣consistency  and absurdity recoils in the pre∣sent instance from Mr Paine upon his anta∣gonist  Mr Wakefield next attacks our author's de∣finition of the word  Revelation  in its  scriptural  or  religious sense  but his attack is so impotent and at the same time so illconducted that I cannot possibly characterize it more aptly than by asking in Mr Wakefield's own words  Can any thing in reality be more feeble and inefficient than this objection  It would amply justify the insertion of the Latin quota∣tion which Mr Wakefield has so successfully introduced on this occasion were I ambitious of enriching my page with classical allusions Mr Paine observes  As it is necessary to affix right ideas to words I will before I proceed further into the subject offer some observations on the word  Revelation  Revelation when applied to religion  and it is in  this  sense solely that Mr Paine considers it and therefore Mr Wakefield's attempt at sarcasm in his case of the  Village Dame  and her  hornbook  see page is totally irrevalent and at best but a con∣ceited quibble "means something commu∣nicated  immediately  from God to man"  "No one will deny or dispute" can any thing be more candid than this concession  the power of the Almighty to make such a communication if he pleases But admit∣ing for the sake of a case that something has been revealed to a certain person and not revealed to any other person it is reve∣lation to that person only When he tells it to a second person a second to a third a third to a fourth and so on it ceases to be revelation to all those persons It is re∣velation to the first person only and  hearsay  to every other and consequently they are not obliged to believe it  "This statement also" exclaims Mr Wake∣field with all the selfsufficiency of a Peda∣gogue  is inaccurate fallacious and incon∣clusive  That I deny and till Mr Wakefield can produce me some more satisfactory proof than mere assertion I shall not abide by his  ipse dixit  Indeed in all what Mr Wakefield has advanced upon  this  subject I cannot trace so much as the shadow of an argument He jumbles together a few crude superficial ob∣servations on the  mission of Moses  and his  cre∣dentials  which however unhappily make di∣rectly against his own cause The miracles  said to have been wrought by Moses in proof of his mission supposing them to be  authentic  a circumstance by the bye which Mr Wake∣field does not take upon himself to warrant  Mr Wakefield's language on this occasion is so very extraordinary that I cannot refrain from quoting it  Whe∣ther such display of supernatural agency  he writes page  were in  reality  made in the case before us by  Moses  to the  Israelites  is not now the question I am only attempting to exhibit the proposition in its proper form and stating the fact as it exists whether  authentically  or otherwise in the  Mosaic  history  cannot be looked upon as competent and satis∣factory evidence inasmuch as many of them were performed with equal success by the Egyp∣tian Sorcerers of Pharaoh's court whence it should seem that if any inference is to be drawn from this display of supernatural agency it amounts to no more than this that Moses who is expressly said to have been  learned in all the  wisdom  of the Egyptians  This quotation I purposely introduce notwithstanding the "palpable untruth" implied in it according to Mr Wakefield's assertion I shall however decline vindicating it in the present instance as I reserve my remarks upon this subject till I come to Mr Paine's Strictures on the  Mosaic account of the Creation  Acts vii had excelled his masters and was become a greater adept in  magic  than themselves As to those mischievous miracles which Moses was empowered to perform and which the magicians of Pharaoh's court in vain essayed to imitate such for instance as the  plague of lice  the  murrain of beasts  the sore and grievous plague of  blains and blisters  the plague of  hail  of  locusts  of  palpable darkness  but more particularly the  destruction of all the firstborn in Egypt both of man and beast  I reserve my remarks upon this plaguy subject to a future opportunity only observing in this place that it appears very extraordinary that Moses should be commissioned to preface his first introduction to Pharaoh with a palpable falsehood  The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we beseech thee  three days' journey  into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God  Exod iii when it is evi∣dent from the th verse of the same chapter  I am come down to deliver my people out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amo∣rites  and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites  which places were cer∣tainly more than  "three day's journey"  distant from the abode of the Israelites when it is evident I say that it was never intended they should stop in the wilderness much less return back to the land of  Goshen  Hence it should seem that  falsehood  and  prevarication  are to be reckoned among the  credentials  of the mission of Moses But to proceed  "It is a contradiction in terms and ideas" continues Mr Paine  to call any thing a  revelation  that comes to us at  second hand  either verbally or in writing Revelation is necessarily limited to the  first  communica∣tion After this it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to  him  and though  he  may find himself obliged to believe it it cannot be incumbent on  me  to believe it in the same manner for it was no revelation made to  me  and I have only  his word  for it that it was made to  him  These together with Mr Paine's former remarks on the subject of  Revelation  in the  religious  acceptation of the  word  appear to me to contain such a clear just and masterly defi∣nition  of the term that had I not positive evi∣dence to the contrary before my eyes I should hardly believe it possible for any man to dissent from him And yet we find that this as little as other passages of Mr Paine's book can es∣cape censure and even misrepresentation  Dr Priestly after pronouncing his argu∣ments to be  truly curious  and as he believes  quite original  see page gives us a very unfair and partial statement of the case  On this principle it is not incumbent on Mr Paine to believe what any person may tell him and he may give credit to nothing but what he sees himself in which case his faith will be reduced to a very small com∣pass indeed His pretence to a  contradiction in terms  is a mere quibble We do not say that the revelation made immediately to Moses or to Christ is strictly speaking a reve∣lation to  us  but if we see sufficient reason to believe that the revelation  was  made to  them  are properly speaking believers in revela∣tion and if the revelation whatever it be relate to the whole human race as well as to the person to whom it was immediately made all mankind Mr Paine himself in∣cluded  will find themselves under an equal  obligation  to respect it  In this exemplification the Doctor allows himself a greater latitude of construction than we conceive ourselves bound to concede to him Had Mr Paine in stating his own individual rejection of revelation attached any degree of blame to those of an opposite opinion he would have been guilty of uncharitableness and in∣justice by usurping that controul over the opinion of others which he very properly re∣fuses to submit to himself But this is far from being the case Mr Paine does not be∣tray the remotest disposition or desire to aim at such despotic sway over the souls and con∣sciences of men  I do not mean writes our author page to condemn those who believe otherwise They have the same right to  their  belief as I have to  mine  He contents himself with assigning his reasons for not believing certain recorded facts and tenets without insinuating the slightest degree of censure against those who viewing things in a different light deem themselves bound to place implicit faith and confidence therein He very modestly says  I did not  see  the angel and therefore I have a  right  not to believe his appearance The  revelation was not made to  me  and there∣fore it cannot be  incumbent  upon  me  to be∣lieve it  And speaking of mankind in ge∣neral he does not say  they  act wrong  in believing it  but merely  they are not  obliged  to believe it  As the liberty of thought is not and indeed  cannot be  obnoxious to that restraint which arbitrary power frequently imposes upon our words and actions every man we apprehend has a right to the most unlimited freedom of opinion in his own individual capacity It is indeed his birthright and perhaps of all his just and numerous rights the only one which the lawless hand of despotism cannot invade On this principle therefore instead of deem∣ing Dr Priestley's statement of the case any argument against the justice of Mr Paine's remarks we are clearly of opinion  that it is  not  incumbent on Mr Paine nor upon any other man to believe what any person may tell him  if he has or conceives him∣self to have good and grounded reason for withholding his faith And though by refusing to credit any transaction which he does not see with his own eyes here the Doctor by the bye carries his proposition to a much  greater length than Mr Paine's  The very reverse of this insinuation is abundantly apparent in many passages of Mr Paine's book Speak∣ing of Jesus Christ he says  That such a person as Jesus Christ existed and that he was crucified which was the mode of execution at that day are historical relations strictly within the limits of probability  So neither does he call in question the existence of Moses or of Da∣vid nor the historical transactions of the kings of Judah and Israel all he combats is the absurdity of bestowing the title of  God's word  upon a miscellaneous collection of  Chronicles Registers Genealogies Anecdotes Ethics Poetry Rhapsody Epistles c c  statements will warrant as our author only refuses his faith to  supernatural  and  miraculous  events which militate directly against the ordinary and established course of nature though by refusing to credit any transaction which he does not see with his own eyes a man no doubt will reduce his faith and knowledge to a very small compass indeed still we cannot conceive such a refusal however un∣reasonable to be culpable immoral and cri∣minal to that degree as to merit the punish∣ment of  eternal perdition  which however by the Christian system is flatly denounced  against every one who disbelieves a single word or even an  iota  of the scriptures  Matthew v xxiv Mark xvi Luke xvi Thess ii Rev xxii    Mr Paine is further accused of  quibbling  because he styles it a  contradiction in terms  to call any thing a  revelation  that comes to us at  secondhand  but I apprehend that the charge of quibbling will be found in the present instance to fall with greater weight and justice upon the party who brings this crimination against him "We do not argues Dr Priestley  say that the revelation made immediately to Moses or to Christ is strictly speaking a reve∣lation to  us  and yet he immediately subjoins  If we see sufficient reason to believe that the revelation was made to them we are properly speaking  be∣lievers  in revelation and if the revela∣tion whatever it be relate to the whole human race as well as to the person to whom it was immediately made  all  mankind Mr Paine himself included will find themselves under an  equal obli∣gation  to respect it  Can any thing let me appeal to the reader's candour favour more strongly of quibble and subterfuge than this By a parallel argument I might prove the obligation the whole English nation and let me add the whole human race at large is under to respect and believe in the won∣derful  revelations  lately made to that en∣lightened Prince of modern prophets Mr Richard Brothers  Mr Wakefield has been at some pains with the superaddition of a formidable  trio  of Latin quotations to show us the justice of the Mosaic doctrine of  visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children  Exclusive of the glaring impiety of this doctrine which Mr Paine justly observes  is contrary to every principle of moral justice  it stands in direct irrecon∣cileable contradiction to the most explicit declarations in several other parts of the Bible Thus it is expressly commanded in Deut xxiv  The father shall not be put to death for the children neither shall the children be put to death for the father every man shall be put to death for his own sin  So likewise Amaziah's con∣duct is highly applauded Kings xiv Chron xxv because in avenging the death of his father  he flew not the children of the murderers according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses c  Here likewise may be referred the following passage in Je∣remiah xxxi  In those days they shall say no more The fathers have eaten a four grape and the children's teeth are set on edge  And Ezekiel xviii  What say ye that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel saying The fathers have eaten four grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge As I live faith the Lord God ye shall no more use this proverb in Is∣rael The soul that sinneth it shall die  And again in the th verse of the same chapter  The soul that sinneth it shall die The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him  Can any thing be more decisive and ex∣plicit and yet Mr Wakefield is such a staunch de∣termined advocate and admirer of the  visiting system  unto the  third  and  fourth  generation that he overlooks these and innumerable other passages in scripture of similar import and enters into a serious defence of the diabolical doctrine of punishing the innocent with the guilty though he has both  Moses  and the  prophets  decidedly against him  even unto the  third  and  fourth  generation and it is a mercy the vengeance stops  there  which forms such a prominent feature in the two tables of the commandments written we are told by the express singer of God Now we  cannot but lament when we peruse Mr Wakefield's arguments on this subject that any capacity not  constitutionally defec∣tive  should be capable of forming such derogatory ideas of that great Almighty Being who is emphatically styled the  Foun∣tain of all Goodness  and the  Father of Mer∣cies  whom John by the happinest personi∣fication calls  Love  itself we cannot but lament that any capacity not "constitu∣tionally defective" should entertain such un∣worthy I had almost said blasphemous no∣tions of the benevolent Author of Nature as to ascribe to the Deity attributes and pro∣pensities which the most lawless tyrant would blush to own to The God whose omnipo∣tence is competent to punish sin in its  re∣motest ramifications  has mercy to  nip the growing evil in the bud  or shall we boast the wisdom and humanity of modern civi∣lized legislature which professes to aim ra∣ther at the  prevention  than  punishment  of crimes and impiously suppose that  Eternal Justice  and  Unerring Wisdom  should act upon a plan diametrically opposite upon a prin∣ciple which  fiends  must contemplate with  execration Reason revolts at the horrid diabolical idea  I have before had occasion to remark upon the illiberality of Mr Wakefield's attack which displays itself in a very conspicuous manner in various passages of his work and I cannot dismiss the present subject with∣out observing that his application of the  visiting system  to the late rigorous and un∣merited sufferings of Mr Paine see page seems to carry with it notwithstanding his boasted sympathy and regret an air of triumph and exultation that calls to my mind in lively colours the treatment which Job received in his affliction from his three pretended friends and comforters  Re∣member I pray thee who ever perished being innocent or where were the righ∣teous cut off  Job iv  Mr Paine's strictures on the  miraculous  The writer of a certain virulent attack upon our author entitled  Christianity the only true Theology  who very properly styles himself a  Churchman  for he is evi∣dently the  tool of party  accuses Mr Paine of the most  dissolute  and  impudent buffoonery  and with that  charita∣bleness  which characterizes most of Mr Paine's antago∣nists compares him to  "the sow at its vomit"  page Now I appeal to every candid examiner whether Mr Paine has not treated the subject of the  immaculate con∣ception  of Jesus Christ a subject which had he really me∣rited the character so  charitably  bestowed upon him might have afforded ample scope for the display of his talents with a degree of delicacy and forbearance which gives the  lie direct  to such impudent unsupported aspersions  and  immaculate conception  of Christ as they have an obvious tendency to promote the cause of  Unitarianism  meet with little or no animadversion from our two Unitarian divines Mr Wakefield expressly acknow∣ledges that  the immaculate conception of Jesus Christ by the  Holy Spirit  consti∣tutes no  essential  article of  his  creed and therefore he leaves the vindication of it to the orthodox sons of the establish∣ment  Doctor Priestley follows him nearly on the same ground and as it is their common interest to reason the  divinity of Christ  fairly out of the Bible they both of them have recourse to supposed  errata  and  spurious interpolations  to invalidate the plain and positive testimonies which we find  on record in the scriptures in favour of the  Godhead  of Jesus Christ The two first chapters of the Gospel of St Matthew are peremptorily rejected because there is no possibility of  softening down  their evidence which makes immediately against the Uni∣tarian system The same fate for the same reason is awarded against the two first chap∣ters of the Gospel of St Luke and thus they hope at once to get over a difficulty which must otherwise prove an insurmountable stumblingblock and rock of offence in their way But their hopes are far too sanguine and they have no alternative but either to∣tally to reject  all  faith in the revelation or concede this point The miraculous birth of Christ does not depend upon the single testimony of St Matthew or St Luke as its only vouchers it stands plainly predicted I am arguing on the principle of a belief in revelation in the prophecies of Isaiah where it is expressly said and men∣tioned emphatically as a  sign  or  miracle  a  sign  which the Lord himself should give after it had been submitted to Ahab to ask a  sign  of the Lord God either in the depth be∣neath or in the height above  Behold  a  Virgin  shall  conceive  and  bear  a Son and shall call his name  Immanuel  Isaih viii So likewise in the Epis∣tle to the Hebrews we find  Christ  declared to be a  High Priest  after the  Order of Mel∣chisedec  as being  without father without mother  in as far as he was not engen∣dered after the ordinary course of nature  without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life  It would be endless to animadvert upon all the absurdities and inconsistencies to which a  partial  belief in the word of God as the Scrip∣tures are styled must necessarily and invari∣ably lead The man who subscribes to the adulteration or interpolation of a  part  by that very concession invalidates my faith in the  whole  The same right by which he presumes to reject any obnoxious passages that militate against the system which  he  has been led to adopt authorizes  me  to do the same by any part which does not accord with  my  ideas and this right of rejection and dis∣crimination being once admitted and establish∣ed it becomes a very easy task  such and so various are the tastes and opinions of men  to argue and fritter away the  whole  And although "one defect of demonstration" as Mr Wakefield observes  has not im∣paired the general truth of the Newtonian philosophy  the application of this pro∣position to  Religion  and the  word of God  will not hold good Newton and every other philosopher however enlightened and intel∣ligent as men are liable to error and there∣fore claim as such our indulgence but the writings which we emphatically honour with the name of  God's Word  and which we pro∣fess to believe in as given by divine inspira∣tion  All  Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is  profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the Man of God may be  perfect  Tim iii  for our rule of faith and conduct these we apprehend ought to bear the stamp of divinity in every page in every line in every word ought by their purity and per∣fection to distinguish themselves from the  works of man  of which  imperfection  ever remains the  prominent characteristic  And therefore wherever this infallible  criterion of perfection  is wanting I am certainly justified in not  receiving such a mass of  incongruity and im∣perfection  as the transcript of the omniscient mind Or shall charges of interpolation and perversion which in judicial proceedings in the case of a will or covenant for instance would if proved totally abrogate and disannul the validity of the instrumentshall I say charges such as these in a case of far greater magnitude and moment in a case which con∣cerns at once the honour of the Deity and the happiness of the whole human race be disregarded as nugatory futile and irrevalent  Viewing things in this light it will per∣haps be asked why I should make choice of two Unitarian publications for the subject of my disquisitions in preference to so many Treatises written on the same topic by the zealous and avowed partizans of the Established Church To this demand I make answer that as the Unitarian Creed appears to ad∣mit of much greater latitude of construction together with an almost unlimited freedom of rejection with respect to whatever mili∣tates against its own system in the Scriptures I conceived that any conviction brought home against the professors and advocates of  this faith  must infallibly carry with it double  weight and authority and ultimately conduce more to the  Cause of Truth  and the  Triumph of Reason  than my labours would have done had I attacked the followers and disciples of the  good old way  who from their implicit assent to  that monstrous farrago of absurdi∣ties and contradictions concentrated with most ingenious and comprehensive brevity in the  Creeds  denominated the  Athanasian  and  Nicene  I quote Mr Wakefield's own emphatic words are infinitely more  vulnerable  Besides as we are expressly told by Mr Wakefield in the Introduction to his Work  that  Christianity cannot  be vindi∣cated adequately and consistently against  Deism  by any votary of  systems  and  esta∣blishments  it should seem unmanly to direct our assault against that quarter from which the least resistance is to be expected I enter now upon the most serious part of my Defence  As the  Resurrection  of Jesus Christ is made by the Apostles themselves the  grand test  and  criterion  of his  divine mission  and of the  truth of the Christian religion  for  if Christ be not  risen  then is our  preaching  vain and your  Faith  is vain also  Cor xv  it will naturally be expected that our  Cham∣pions of the Faith  should reserve their most  formidable batteries  for the bold aggressor who dares to lift his impious hand against this  strong hold  of their hope Hence I was led to apprehend a redoubtable display of  heavy artillery  and  weighty arguments  in an∣swer to Mr Paine's bold attack upon the  authenticity  of this important and funda∣mental article of the Christian creed but not a little was I disappointed  "I shall confine myself writes Mr Wakefield page  to one only argu∣ment which appears to my mind inca∣pable of confutation upon any principles of philosophy or experience and will indeed admit of no dispute but upon positions subversive of all historical testi∣mony whatsoever and introductory of universal scepticism  The numerous circumstances inter∣spersed through the  Gospel narratives  and in the  Acts  of the  Apostles  appertaining to the geography of countries the posi∣tions of rivers towns and cities public transactions of much notoriety and ac∣count in those days the dress customs  manners languages of nations and indi∣viduals political characters of eminence and their conduct in connection with a most potent and enlightened empire with a vast multiplicity of detached occur∣rences and facts not necessary to be speci∣fied at large all these circumstances I say probable in themselves and of fide∣lity unimpeached challenge to speak with moderation as large a portion of credibility to these books considered in the simple character of  historical  This position we apprehend was never called nor in∣tended to be called in question by Mr Paine whose animad∣versions upon the scriptures if we conceive aright do not attach to them in their  historical  capacity as chronicles and records of human transactions and events in which light they certainly claim an equal portion of credibility as long as they steer clear of the  marvellous  and  supernatural  with the writings of any other historian of received veracity but are solely directed against their claim to  revelation  and the  unwarrantable requisition  they make upon our faith to tales of most  monstrous prodigy  which militate directly against the established order of nature and which the rea∣der therefore has an equal right to reject in the  Chranicles of the Jews  and in the  Gospel Narratives  as he has in the Greek or Roman historians Few it is presumed who have read  Plutarch's Lives  entertain any doubts as to the general authenticity of the transactions recorded in that valuable work and yet many perhaps might be found who cannot reconcile their notions of probabilities to a belief in the apparition of the phantom supposed to be Coesar's ghost to his murderer Brutus at Abydos The inference is obvious and renders all comments upon the case unne∣cessary  testi∣monials  as can be claimed for any writ∣ings whatever received as genuine and equally ancient and multifarious Now no mean presumption arises in favour of the most  extraordinary  transactions also blended in the same texture of narrative by historians of so credible a character with respect to the rest of their relations but when those  extraordinary facts  are found to have so intimate an incorpora∣tion with the  common  and  unsuspicious  occurrences of these histories as to ad∣mit of no detachment but to stand or fall with the main body of the compo∣sitions so that one part depends upon another for consistency and support I cannot see how any historical probability of the authenticity of these  extraordinary  events can rise higher than in such an instance  When I find such lame subterfuge and so∣phistry usurp the place of sound argument I cannot but congratulate Mr Paine on his triumph If the  resurrection of Christ  stands upon no better basis than this rotten is its sup∣port and it must inevitably fall to the ground Mr Wakefield we apprehend will not refuse to the books of  Livy  the same internal symp∣toms of genuineness and authenticity which he ascribes to the  Gospel narratives  as far as appertains to the  geography of countries the positions of rivers towns and cities public transactions of much notoriety and account the dress customs manners languages of nations individuals c  which he expatiates upon so ably as  chal∣lenging as large a portion of credibility to the  Gospel narratives  as can be claimed for any writings whatever received as genuine and equally ancient and multi∣farious  and yet were I to argue upon the principle laid down in this proposition by Mr Wakefield himself and from the  credi∣bility of the  common  and  unsuspicious  occur∣rences of this history to infer no mean pre∣sumption  in favour of the most  extraor∣dinary  transactions also recorded by the historian  I might undertake to prove the authenticity of all the  prodigies  and  marvellous  events related by Livy such for instance as the prophetic denunciation of the ox  See Livy book xxxv chap  belonging to the Consul Cn Domi∣tius "ROMA CAVE TIBI" which furnishes indeed no unworthy counterpart to the story of  Balaam's Ass  or the  tears  shed by the image of the goddess  Juno Sospita  Ibidem book xl chap  at La∣nuvium which not improbably may have furnished many a serviceable hint to the  wonderworkers  The ingenious compiler of the  Characteristic Anec∣dotes of the Russian Emperor Peter the Great  published by royal authority at Petersburgh gives a very remarkable instance of this monarch's sagacity and at the same time of the villainy of the crafty sons of Loyola Peter having given offence to the clergy by some of his innovations the priesthood among other attempts to baffle his designs had recourse to a  miracle  Suddenly it was reported that the image of the Virgin Mary in one of their churches had been observed to  weep  nor was the cause of these  hea∣venly tears  pointed out in very ambiguous terms Mul∣titudes flocked to the  sacred shrine  to convince themselves by  ocular demonstration  of the truth of this  portentous pro∣digy  for such the priests unanimously pronounced it to be and returned back like the apostles of old fully satisfied of the fact having  heard  and  seen  and  handled  and for aught I know  tasted  of these tears which many from a principle of devotion had caught in handkerchiefs and even vials as they fell At length the monarch who easily penetrated into the true motives of this miracle was induced to pay the  weeping saint  a visit Several of the superior clergy accompanied him by his order in whose presence he pro∣ceeded to examine into the mystery A ladder being pro∣cured Peter ascended the steps and pulling off the golden crown that encompassed the Virgin's head made a complete discovery of the whole plot The blessed Mother of Christ it seems had undergone the trepan which having laid her scull open a silver vessel containing about a pint and a half of water was introduced which by means of small punctures was very dexterously made to distil through the eyes in the form of tears  of the Greek and Romish  churches or lastly the  foaling of a mule  Livy book xxxvii chap  at Reate which perhaps is not more re∣pugnant to the ordinary course of nature than the  immaculate conception and delivery of a virgin  in Bethlehem  As little can Mr Wakefield hope to estab∣lish the truth of the Resurrection of Christ by instancing the unconquered perseverance with which the apostles persisted in profes∣sing and preaching this doctrine in spite of  ridicule contempt persecution poverty bodily chastisements imprisonment and death  Mr Wakefield is not aware how strongly and directly this argument makes against himself Reasoning upon the very same principle I will easily prove  that monstrous farrago of absurdities and con∣tradictions concentrated with most in∣genious and comprehensive brevity in the  creeds  denominated the  Athanasian  and  Nicene  and which is so tough of digest∣ion to Mr Wakefield's stomach all this I will easily prove to be the  Truth as it is in Christ Jesus  Ephes iv inasmuch as many thousands of sincere professors and among these  bishops  themselves have suffered the most cruel and ignominious death rather than renounce their faith in these creeds In∣deed I am fearful that in matters of religion there cannot possibly be a more fallacious criterion to ascertain the truth than the  stubborn pertinacity with which men adhere to their opinion  But by far the weakest place in Mr Wake∣field's defence of the resurrection is the fol∣lowing passage in which he attempts to invalidate the force of the objections raised by Mr Paine on the plea of this miracle not being accompanied with that degree of publicity which the nature of the case so well admitted of and which the magnitude of the fact if true demanded  The resurrection of a dead person from the grave writes Mr Paine and his as∣cension through the air is a thing very dif∣ferent as to the evidence it admits of from the invisible conception of a child in the womb The resurrection and ascen∣sion supposing them to have taken place admitted of public and ocular demonstra∣tion like that of the ascension of a balloon or the sun at noonday to all Jerusalem at least A thing which every body is re∣quired to believe requires that the proof and evidence of it should be equal to all and universal and as the public visibility of this last related act was the only evi∣dence that could give sanction to the for∣mer  part the whole of it falls to the ground because that evidence never was given Instead of this a small number of persons not more than  Here Mr Paine as his antagonist justly observes has fallen into an error with respect to the number of persons said to have been witnesses of Christ's resurrection and ascension The strength of the argument however sustains no detriment by it and furthermore it must be remembered that our author is refuted only by the sin∣gle evidence of Paul Cor xv and that only in one solitary instance and who knows but this passage only that it makes against the  Author of the Age of Reason  might have been one of Mr Wakefield's  occasional inter∣polations  see page  eight or nine are introduced as proxies for the whole world to say they  saw  it and all the rest of the world are called upon to believe it But it appears that Thomas did not believe the resurrection and as they say would not believe without having ocular and manual demonstration himself  So neither will I  and the reason holds equally good for me and every other person as for Thomas  In this statement of our author whatever Mr Wakefield may affect to think or say to  the contrary I discern nothing but just and manly argument It is an established rule in the moral as well as physical world that the  means should be adequate to the end  and it is upon this principle that Mr Paine reasons in the present instance The re∣surrection of Christ as I before observed forming the grand test of the truth of Chris∣tianity to substantiate and blazon abroad the fact beyond the power of controversy becomes an object of the first magnitude As the belief required in it extends to all Mr Paine stands justified in requiring that the evidence of it should be accompanied with a competent degree of publicity The nature of the fact admitted of such public demonstration the magnitude of the object demanded it and yetthis public demon∣stration is withheldthe only evidence which would at once have rendered all the eternal wranglings since maintained upon the subject unnecessary which would have com∣pletely baffled all the alledged machinations of the enemies of Christ to suppress the truth and invalidate its force and which would have procured Christianity a decisive triumph over scepticism and infidelity this  only full satisfactory incontrovertible irre∣fragable evidence is not granted And why not granted Because forsooth its place in the eyes of Mr Wakefield is better supplied by  corroborating coincidencies collateral cir∣cumstances by probabilities of the highest kind by indissoluble connexions  et hoc genus omne  all of which by the bye not∣withstanding the inconceivable magnitude of the object notwithstanding the incalcu∣lable interest at stake do not amount to the same degree of positive conviction which impresses on the mind of the  geometer  the  equality of the  three angles  of a  triangle  to  two right angles  See page of Mr Wakefield's work  We concede indeed to Mr Wakefield that in occurrences of common life the con∣curring testimony of credible and disinter∣ested witness may be considered as compe∣tent evidence in matters of  plain fact  which do not militate against the established order of things Thus for instance to pursue Mr Wakefield's own argument when I first heard of the ascension of  Lunardi  from  the Artillery ground in a balloon I felt myself no more disposed to call in question the truth of the report notwithstanding from the circumstance of my being abroad at the time I did not enjoy the advantage of being an eyewitness of the fact than Mr Wake∣field could possibly do who we find was present on that memorable occasion But had I been ignorant of the principle on which balloons are constructed had I never heard or read of the properties of air had the experiment been made in some remote far distant part of the globe before only a few select friends and in only one or two solitary instances and never afterwards repeated or attempted had this I say been the case and any one had told me under such circum∣stances that a man had been seen to ascend to a prodigious height in the air and to pursue his  aerial  excursion for a considerable number of miles with incredible velocity in that case the faith of the relator of this marvellous account supposing him to have been at the same time an eyewitness of the fact would I fancy exceed mine by many an  "evanescent infinitesimal  of efficacy"  See page or Mr Wakefield's work  And  though no lapse of time will probably with respect to the  former  case the actual ascension of Lunardi in a balloon from the Artillery ground destroy a credibility so well founded and established with reasonable men nothing I apprehend short of  actual inspection  and  ocular demonstration  would attach faith with thinking minds to the  latter  Neither would I presume any man's refusal to credit such an ascension under the above circumstances without positive and ocular proof draw down upon him the stigma of  universal scepticism  though Mr Wakefield is pleased to insinuate this charge against Mr Paine when he talks of the man  who is resolved to believe no transaction but upon  ocular and manual demonstration  and who therefore is com∣pelled to bely his own theory in every movement of his life  Before I dismiss the subject of the  resur∣rection  as far as concerns Mr Wakefield's strictures in favor of it I must slightly re∣mark upon a most  curious  and  extraordinary  argument indeed see page which he brings forward to justify our being left in this confessedly highly momentous and in∣teresting  affair to  trust to degrees of  pro∣bability  infinitely diversified  or in other words being left in the  dark    instead of having positive  certainty  for our guide  I might advance also in aid of these re∣marks  to give the whole of Mr Wake∣field's arguments  that mankind are most evidently placed here in a state of  proba∣tionary imperfection  that instead of  cer∣tainty  for our guide we are compelled to trust on most occasions to a degree of  probability  infinitely diversified and that some of our noblest and most refined ex∣cellencies both moral and intellectual spring from a forbearance and candour from a diffidence and docility and lowliness of understanding which  dis∣putable evidence  is best calculated to gene∣rate and foster Besides that exercise and agitation of our mental powers which is invariably produced by the delays and dif∣ficulties intervening propositions of this nature and the attainment of moral cer∣tainty in a painful disquisition of evidence and a long deduction of particulars con∣tribute essentially to the quickness the clearness the vigour and general salubrity of our understandings just as the water  of a river is meliorated and refined by a winding obstructed passage over sand and gravel  Of all the wretched sophistry I ever re∣member to have met with on this or I might add on any other subject the present furnishes the most conspicuous and I think the most contemptible instance Are there not matters enough of  "disputable evidence"  to generate and foster our candour and for∣bearance our diffidence and docility in the  Book of Nature  without borrowing from the  sacred pages of Revelation  Or if we stand in need of  exercise and agitation of our mental powers to contribute to the quick∣ness the clearness the vigour and general salubrity of our understandings  might not the time and talents which have been spent in the  painful disquisition of evidence and a long deduction of particulars  to ascertain the truth of the  resurrection  have been far more profitably employed upon researches which have a more immediate reference to the happiness and improvement of man in his present state We verily think they might and  maugre  the  profound know∣ledge  and  deep metaphysical reasoning  contained  in Mr Wakefield's remarks they appear to us in reality designed for little more than to serve as a  vehicle  to the author to display his  extensive reading  and  ready acquaintance  with the Poets of the Augustan age  The  remarks  for I cannot call them  argu∣ments  advanced by Doctor Priestley concern∣ing the evidence of the resurrection carry with them still less weight and conviction than Mr Wakefield's strictures He notices the error into which Mr Paine has fallen with respect to the  number  of persons who are said to have been witnesses of Christ's ascen∣sion and which error I have already had oc∣casion to remark upon But we do not find any thing new or striking in his observations A general challenge indeed is thrown out to all who entertain any doubts upon the subject  to propose any  other circumstances  that would have made the Resurrection more credible than it now is at this dis∣tance of time  but as this challenge has been  anticipated  by Mr Paine himself and the  proposal  or  requisition  made which would have rendered its evidence incontrovertible and of course have established its credibility  beyond the reach of suspicion or doubt we deem it unnecessary to tread over again the beaten track  As my design is not so much to write a panegyric upon Mr Paine's work as to ex∣amine and if I can refute the objections which have been made to it I pass over most of his propositions which I do not find attacked by his opponents Hence I shall not dwell upon the masterly picture he has drawn of his  Satanic Majesty  who I am happy to per∣ceive from the readiness with which Mr Wakefield gives him up and I congratulate my readers upon the pleasing prospect seems to be in a fair way of bidding us  Adieu  and returning once more to the  bottomless pit  where I sincerely hope the  Angel with the key and the great chain in his hand  Rev xx sqq will take good care of him and bind and fasten him  up  or  down  it matters little which at least a  thousand years  In case that is to say our good  Churchmen  our old  Dames  and  Nurses  for whose behoof it seems see Mr Wakefield p these "monstrous doctrines" have been tagged to the  word of God  can any wise do without him    The account given us by Mr Paine of the  Origin of Christianity  has been severely cen∣sured and attacked by Dr Priestley who pronounces it to be  the most  curious ro∣mance  he ever met with  With all de∣ference to superior abilities I cannot but conceive Doctor Priestley to be too hasty in this judgment and though he particu∣larly prides himself on his  dates  in oppo∣sition to Mr Paine's practice who he tells us  does not  deal in dates  any more than in  quotations  writing wholly from  memory  see page it should seem that Mr Paine without the help of a  book  has even with respect to his  dates  not erred so widely from the truth as Dr Priestley's strictures would at first sight tempt us to imagine  The writings ascribed to the men called Apostles  Mr Paine observes  are chiefly controversial and the gloominess of the subject they dwell upon that of a man dying in agony on the cross is better suited to the gloomy genius of a  monk  in his  cell  by whom it is not  impossible  they were written than to any man breathing the open air of the creation  This latter remark of Mr Paine furnishes his formidable antagonist with a most desirable opportunity of triumph as he apprehends but unfortunately his triumph is  premature  as I shall endeavour to prove from his own statement of the case  "As these books written by  Apostles  or  Apostolical  men" does Dr Priestley by this distinction mean to signify his assent to the doubt started by our  How much or what part of the Books called the New Testament were written by the persons whose name they bear is what we know nothing of  Thus writes Mr Paine and Mr Wakefield does not appear to class this among the  hardy  assertions he complains of in our Author for he does not  contravene  the opinion  If the books see page of Mr Wakefield's work  should  not  be written in reality by those identical persons whose names are affixed which is no  essential  circumstance  c  Author relative to the certainty of the books of the New Testament being written by the persons whose names are prefixed to them  were appealed to in decision of controversies it was thought proper to have a  standard  collection and the Bishops met in council at Laodicea Anno Domini did as well as they  could  but by no means to the satisfaction of  all  Doctor Priestley allows therefore that it was nearly four hundred years after the birth of Christ and at least three hundred years after the writing of the major part of the books called the  New Testament  according to the common received chronology before a  standard collection  of these books was made  That  interpolations  and  spurious readings  allowing the Books themselves to have been actually written at the early date I have just specified and by the writers whose names they bear  might  in such a long course of time have crept into the text especially when we consider that the art of printing was not known in those days but that every copy required to be individually transcribed by an  amanuensis  is a  possibility  and let me add a  probability  which I think will be readily con∣ceded by every candid examiner That some of them might have undergone material alte∣rations or have been newmodelled or even fresh vamped up to suit particular purposes between the time of their  original composition  and their subsequent  incorporation  in the  standard collection  is likewise no  impossibility  and on this supposition Mr Paine stands amply justified in the inference he draws from the  dismal complexion  of many of those writ∣ings the controversial parts especially that it is not impossible and he mentions the cir∣cumstance merely as a  possibility  and by no means as a matter of  positive fact  but they may have been written by some gloomy  Ascetic  or  Monk  a conjecture which receives addi∣tional weight and plausibility when we reflect that  The celebrated  August Ludwig Schloezer  Professor of  Statistics  at the University of Goettingen informs us in his  Welt Geschichte  or  Universal History  that the number of  Monks  and  Nuns  in the  principal  convents of Egypt alone amounted towards the end of the fourth century to up∣wards of persons The first regular  Convent  of  Christian Monks  was founded at Tabenna  Anno Domini  by  Pachomius  a disbanded soldier  See Schloezer's Universal History Part I p  Monks  and  Convents  had established themselves nearly half a century before the Bishops met in council at Laodicea to deter∣mine by vote  which  of the books out of the collection they had made  should  be the  Word of God  I see therefore no ground for sup∣posing Mr Paine to have written his  Age of  Reason  without the least knowledge of the  Scriptures  or indeed of  history  "  Such is the express charge brought against him by Dr Priestley see page who from thence argues that his Work is only calculated to  make an impression on those who are as  ignorant  as himself  Conceding this "point to the Doctor though I see no  argument  to extort this concession from us but rather the very  reverse  yet conceding the point for the sake of a case I apprehend that Mr Paine's Work allowing it to make impression upon only  one third  instead of  all  his readers who are not more intelligent than himself bids fair to make ten times the number of proselytes that Mr Priestley has any reason to expect  Mr Priestley further in the exultation of his triumph throws out a challenge to Mr Paine and of course to all those that join with him in opinion  to point out any  one  passage in the New Testament that in the most  distant manner  intimates that God is pleased by the  mortifications  men inflict upon themselves or that it is their duty or at all acceptable to God that they should shut themselves up from the world and decline the active duties of life  Instead of being at a loss to discover  one  I could instantly refer to a  host  of passages a  "whole cloud of witnesses"  and those of the New Testament dispensation to answer this challenge which as it seems to have originated from Mr Paine's  allusion to monks  where he says that  the gloominess of the subject on which the writers of the New Testament expatiate is better suited to the gloomy senses of a  monk in his cell  by whom it is not  impossible  those books were written than to any man breath∣ing the  open air of creation  I shall begin my reply with the grand leading characteristic of the monkish system  celi∣bacy  I have already remarked upon the rise and rapid increase of these  gloomy fanatics  in the early ages of the Christian church That such characters actually existed and were not unknown to the  New Testament writers  and among the rest to the author of the  Epistles to Timothy  is evident from the fourth chapter of the first of these epistles  The Spirit speaketh expressly that in the  lat∣ter  From the frequent recurrence of the term  latter times last days last time evil days  c  Tim iv  Tim iii  Pet iii  Jude v  Eph v  Cor x in the New Testament which expressions bear an obvious allusion not only to an alarming degeneracy both doctrinal and prac∣tical in the church but likewise to a  considerable interstice  between the first foundation of Christianity and the times in which the writers of these Epistles lived it should seem that no mean argument might be inferred against the chronological order in which the books of the New Testament are generally supposed to have been writ∣ten unless indeed we are willing to argue away the force of this objection on the presumption of these disputable passages being  interpolations  St John in his first Epis∣tle ii even goes a step farther and affirms it to be "the  last time  " or as it ought to be rendered  the  last hour  times  some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hy∣pocrisy having their consciences seared with a hot iron  forbidding to marry  and  commanding to abstain from meats  c  which words I apprehend allude in most unequivocal terms to the  monkish  doctrines of  celibacy  and  fasting  Now bearing this in  remembrance let us recur to Paul's first Epistle to the Corinthians and take up our parable at the seventh chapter  It is good for a  man  not to  touch  a  woman    ver    I would that  all  men were even as  I my∣self    ver  How soon would a general compliance with this  unnatural  and let me add  irreligious requisition  for it militates di∣rectly against the first grand commandment given to man by the Almighty  Increase and multiply  and therefore would be a case of  positive disobedience  or to quote Dr Priestley's own words would be  declining the  active duties  of life  terminate in the total extinction of the human race it would be  shutting ourselves not only  up  from the world  but would soon lead to shut∣ting the whole species  out  of the world  The Apostle continues  I say there∣fore to the  unmarried  and  widows  it is  good  for them if they abide even as  I  What reason doth he assign for this strange preposterous doctrine Why forsooth be∣cause  he  that is  unmarried  and  she  that is  unmarried  the  monks  and the  nuns  care for the  things  that belong to the  Lord  how they may  please  the  Lord  whereas  he  that  is married  and  she  that  is married  care for the  things  that are of the  world  how they may  please each other  in the relative stations of  husband  and  wife  Does not this let me put the question to Mr Priestley's own candid reflection does not this incongruous doctrine savour strongly of the  ascetic  and the  monk  Does it not as I before observed  militate point blank  against one of the most active duties if not the most active of  all  the duties of life Does it not but I shall drop the subject only observing that the apostle had better have counselled us at once as the surest way to put and end to the  war in our members  to  make  eunuchs  Matthew xix  of our∣selves for the kingdom of heaven's sake  which we find some of the primitive Chris∣tians actually  did  and among others the celebrated  Origen  having it is said this very saying of Christ with Paul's en∣lightened commentary upon it in view  And here let no man object in extenua∣tion of the absurdity of these doctrines and  tenets that the apostle  is not speaking by  commandment  but by  permission  Cor vii The greater is his  presumption  in daring to broach such vile and dangerous principles which I am sure threaten more immediately the welfare of a state than any principle  however pregnant and full fraught with danger  in the  Rights of Man  and which aim with one decisive blow at the very extinction of the human species the greater I say is Paul's presumption the greater his  guilt  in daring to palm such infamous nonsense upon us under the sanc∣tion and authority of an apostle without even the smallest pretence to  divine command∣ment  in apology for his detestable conduct  In the second place to say a few words upon the  monkish system  of  mortification pe∣nance  and  abstemiousness  in commendation of which Mr Priestley challenges our author to produce a  single  instance I again recur with full confidence of success to the  fruitful  writings of Paul  If ye live after the  flesh  ye shall  die spiritually  speaking I suppose but if ye through the  spirit  do  mortify  the deeds of the  body  ye  shall live  Rom viii  They that are Christ's have  crucified  Does the apostle mean after the  example of Origen  the  flesh  with the  affections  and  lusts  Galat v  I keep under  my  body  and bring it into  subjection  Cor ix the apostle speaks as the context shews of  corporal abstemiousness  see verse  Mortify  your  members  which are upon the  earth  Col iii and from what immediately follows  fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence  c c it is abun∣dantly evident what particular members the apostle alludes to  I am  crucified  unto the  world  and the  world  unto  me  Gal vi Make not  provision  for the  flesh  Rom xiii Give yourselves to  fasting  and  prayer  that satan  tempt  you not for your  incontinency  I am well aware that this quotation begins abruptly in the  middle of a comma  but the reader's own good sense will satisfy him with respect to the suppression of the former part of the sentence without any comment being necessary on my side  Cor vii  Can any thing be more explicit Or will Mr Priestley with these plain and positive declarations before his eyes which how∣ever are only brought forward as a  specimen  of the "vast cloud of witnesses" that are kept in reserve still persist in maintaining that there is not  one single  passage in the whole of the New Testament which in the  most distant manner  intimates that God is pleased by  selfdenial  and  mortification  The man who at the very time that he charges his antagonist with  ignorance  and  error  which he  charitably  pretends to account for on the plea of his having written from  memory  and  without book  page can commit still  greater errors  and  blunders  himself  with book  may not unaptly be compared to the proud  pharisee  in the gospel who was  lynx∣eyed  enough to discern a  moat  in his brother's eye though not conscious of the  beam  that lodged in his own  That Mr Paine may have carried his pro∣position too far when he ascribes the great change that took place in the whole system of learning after the introduction of Chris∣tianity to a  deep preconcerted scheme  on the part of the settersup and advocates of that religion I shall not affect to dissemble nor deny But that the  Christian religion was virtually and in reality the cause of that change  I am clearly convinced and Mr Priestley  may boast of the preservation of literature by the  Christian monks  of the western and eastern Roman empire as much as he plea∣ses it remains an incontrovertible fact that the  eternal wranglings about points of faith  and the  nonsensical jargon of priests  gave a new turn to the state of learning which was now made to centre almost entirely in  polemical divinity  and of course rendered the acquisition of those languages in which the books of the Bible were originally written the most important if not the only branch of education  Without the smallest design to depreciate the value of  The most valuable  philology  is beyond dispute a gene∣ral and extensive acquaintance with the most useful of the  modern living languages  philology  in its application to the  learned languages  and experience has too well taught me their proper value and estimation to hold their acquirement in contempt I cannot but subscribe with the fullest energy of conviction to the jus∣tice of Mr Paine's remark that it would be advantageous to the general state of learning  to lay less stress in the system of education upon the  dead languages  than is generally done  Learning  and  knowledge  though commonly reputed  synonimous terms  are far from being so in reality The one consti∣tutes the  shell  the other the  kernel  and cer∣tainly it must be acknowledged the height of folly and absurdity to set greater store upon the  husk  than upon the  fruit  it enve∣lops However to return from this di∣gression  As we happen to be discussing the sub∣ject of  dead languages  it may not be amiss to notice in this place a very just and saga∣cious argument urged with great propriety by our author but rejected and condemned with wonted superciliousness and injustice by his opponents respecting the insuffici∣ency of  human language  to be the vehicle of the  word of God  Mr Paine observes  If we permit ourselves to conceive right ideas of things we must necessarily affix the idea not only of  unchangeableness  but of the utter  impossibility of any change taking place  by any means or accident whatever in that which we would honour with the name of the  word of God  and  therefore the  word of God  cannot exist in  any written or human language  The continually progressive change to which the meaning of words is subject the want of a universal language which renders translations necessary the errors to which translations are again subject the mistakes of copyists and printers toge∣ther with the possibility of wilful altera∣tion are of themselves evidences that hu∣man language whether in speech or in print  cannot be the vehicle of the word of God  "Trite and little to the purpose" ex∣claims Dr Priestley in reply to these truly ingenious remarks  Frivolous and un∣worthy of a man of sense  cries Mr Wakefield and both our learned  Polemics  immediately launch out into a long string of declamation which has hardly the shadow of an argument to countenance it Instead of bearing in mind that the Bible as far as it professes to be a  lanthorn  to our feet a  light  unto our path our  law counsellor  and  guide  relates chiefly to  matters of opinion  and to  matters of faith  and that it therefore is the more liable to suffer from the  defects of translations  the  mistakes  of copyists and  wilful or accidental alterations  they are con∣tinually harping upon its  historical credibility  which our Author does not attempt to invali∣date and comparing it in this point of view to  Livy's Roman History  or  Caesar's Commentaries  "The truths of Revelation" writes Mr Priestley page  do not depend upon  niceties  of ideas  A few  mistakes  of copy∣ists and printers make no alteration in the  general  effect  says Mr Wakefield As a proof however how sadly both these learned gentlemen are deceived and mistaken in the position they so obstinately maintain I shall just adduce  one  instance amongst a number that might be urged which said instance as it adds a fresh laurel to their triumph over  Trinitarianism  entitles me I think to some claim on their acknowledgments  Few texts in the Bible perhaps are more frequently referred to by the  orthodox Sons of the Church  to prove the  divinity of Christ  than the following passage from St Paul's first Epistle to Timothy  And without controversy great is the mystery of god∣liness  GOD  was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on  in the world received up into glory  Tim iii Now would it be believed and yet the fact is well ascertained that the word  God  in which the whole stress of the sentence centres is not to be met with in the original Would it be believed that the singular circumstance of the middle stroke of the E in  having sunk through the parchment so as to appear on the opposite side should exactly occupy the centre of the  omicron  in the  relative  OC which by that means being taken for a  caused the word to pass for  which is the abreviation of  Would it be believed that the  Divinity of Christ  should rest upon such a slender foundation as this And yet such is the actual state of the case as the  See  Wetstenii Proleg in N T  page et sqq Edit Halens  Alexandrine Codex  plainly proves Mr Priestley I hope will no longer take upon him to deny that the truths of Revelation may depend upon very  great niceties  Another instance of gross error and mis∣take occurs in Mr Wakefield's reply to our Author's strictures on the history of the cre∣ation  Why it has been called the  Mosaic Ac∣count of the creation  writes Mr Paine  I am at a loss to conceive Moses I be∣lieve was too good a judge of such sub∣jects to put his name to that account He had been educated among the  Egyptians  who were a people as well skilled in science and particularly in astronomy as any people in their day  To this  true  and  modest  statement Mr Wakefield replies with all the haughty self∣sufficiency of a  Dictator  in the Republic of Letters  All this may be literally true see page but a palpable untruth is implied in it that the  Egyptians  were really a learned and scientific people whereas their science and their astronomy was just  nothing at all  The learned and justly celebrated professor  Schloezer  whose authority and the testimony of  such  a man I deem sufficient authority I have already in a former instance had occasion to refer to bears evidence to the  wisdom  and  science  of the  Egyptians  in the most honorable and une∣quivocal terms As  German Literature  is not known  ade∣quately to its merits  in this country I subjoin a translation of one or two extracts from this valuable work "  Egypt  he writes see his  Universal History  first part page was probably the most ancient  postdiluvian  state in the world Moses who was a  pupil of the Egyp∣tians  was himself unacquainted with its origin otherwise he would no doubt have informed us of it as he has done of the origin of Babylon As early as the times of Abraham we find a  regular court  with  courtsycophants  in abun∣dance who neglect not to give his majesty timely notice the moment a beautiful lady from foreign parts sets foot in his dominions Gen xii At Joseph's time we find this  court greatly increased in splendor  with  suit∣able appendages  of  grandeur and officers of state  and fur∣thermore a  numerous priesthood  invested with  hereditary revenues  and a  standing army  at the time of Moses And all this in  LowerEgypt  only though it is highly probable that  Upper Egypt was cultivated much earlier  "  And in page he writes  "That the  Egyptians  were the most ancient of  all  cul∣tivated nations is established beyond a doubt they were the  wisest  nation upon earth even according to the tes∣timony of the  Oracle at Delphi  they were the  instructors  of the  Hebrews  and the  Greeks  and powerful and high∣lycultivated even at the time when Greece and all Europe was overrun with forests in whose shades in∣dividual groups of savages fed upon acorns The young Greeks were not acquainted with them till in the  wane  of their glory Herodotus found  Thebes  a heap of ruins and could procure no certain intelligence concerning the  age of the Pyramids  He saw  statues  which had tumbled down with  age  notwithstanding they were probably like the unperishable cases of their  mummies  made of sycamore wood To the  Egyptians  the  Greeks  stand indebted page for the  whole  of their  wisdom  and  cultivation  as do the  Hebrews  likewise for the  greatest part  of theirs Their architectural ruins surpass all the relics we have of Grecian Persian and Roman architecture and will endure longer in their present condition than the most modern of our palaces for neither earthquakes nor rain casualties to which they are not exposed cause them to decay To  their astronomers  the world stands indebted for the  true Solar year  within eleven minutes five seconds at leastThis  learned  people page wrote both in  hieroglyphics  and with  letters  upon  stones hermetical columns    and  obelisks  and afterwards upon the  Papyrus  or  Egyptian bullrush  which is of  greater antiquity  than  Numa  "    It requires no great portion of penetration to discover Mr Wakefield's true motives for  refusing to allow the  Egyptians  their  just tri∣bute of scientific praise  He is well aware that the concession of this point would detract from the  high encomiums  he has passed upon the  Jews  see page as the  first founders and cultivators  it should seem of  science  and which he obliquely urges as a proof of the  revelations  and  supernatural communications  page said to have been vouchsafed to Moses But Mr Wakefield may  romance  upon this subject as long as he pleases he cannot  invalidate those incontrovertible evidences to  Egyptian science and cultivation  which the writings of Moses himself afford and of which I might easily produce convincing specimens in abundance did I see any further  need of witnesses  after the  respectable voucher  I have already brought forward in support of the  claims of the Egyptians  Indeed the  whole of the Mosaic account of the creation  appears to have been borrowed from documents of still greater  This is not merely my own individual opinion it is entertained and most ably vindicated likewise by com∣mentators of the first erudition and celebrity  Eichhorn's Einleitung in das Alte Testament    Eichhorn  's Introduc∣tion to the Study of the Old Testament Part II p  antiquity which he found ready prepared to his hand and of which it is certainly more reasonable to suppose that Moses availed himself than to pretend that he received his knowledge of the subject immediately from  divine commu∣nication  His famous history of the  Fall of Man  carries with it unquestionable evidence of the  obligation  he lies under to the  decried depreciated learning of the Egyptians  It is obviously a  transcript  of a  hieroglyphical  representation of some  traditional  account respecting the  deterioration  of human nature which Moses if it was not previously done by some other writer seems to have translated from the language of  emblem  into that of  words  See  Rosemmüller's Erklaerung der Geschichte vom Sünden Fall    Rosemmüllers  Illustration of the Mosaic History of the Fall of Man in the  Repertory of Biblical and Oriental Literature  part v page    Endless would be the task and indeed what I have already advanced considerably exceeds the limits I had originally prescribed to the present undertaking were I to at∣tempt a reply to every  impertinent cavil  raised by these two redoubtable  Champions of Reve∣lation  against the  Age of Reason  I shall there∣fore curtail my strictures as much as pro∣priety will admit  and heartily tired with examining into the inconsistencies  of Mr Wakefield and his learned coadjutor through which I have already fought my way hasten to the conclusion of my disqui∣sitions without stopping to answer objections which are beneath the notice of criticism such for instance as Mr Wakefield's silly  triumph over Mr Paine see page be∣cause our author forsooth has interpreted the term  Testament  in its common accepta∣tion as implying a  will  and I will not take upon me to affirm when the  context  is pro∣perly attended to that Mr Paine is not per∣fectly justified in giving the name of  will  to a  covenant  of which the apostle expressly declares that it is of no force during the lifetime of the  testator  Heb ix Be that however as it may the objection started by Mr Wakefield is perfectly puerile irrevalent and absurd as the force of Mr Paine's argument is not in the slightest de∣gree affected much less invalidated by it The presumption and blasphemy of the charge which ascribes  fickleness of mind  to the Creator and makes him  abrogate  the covenant into which he had formerly en∣tered with his creatures remains the same remains equally impious and daring whe∣ther we distinguish this compact by the ap∣pellation of a  covenant  or by that of  will  To change or amend this covenant implies a defect or incongruity in his former com∣pact which  Omniscience  was not competent  to foresee till experience pointed out the error  for if that  first covenant  Heb viii  had been  fau  tless  then should no place have been found for the  second  but now he  taketh away  the first that he may establish the  second  Heb x  With respect to our author's excellent ani∣madversions on  prophets  and  prophecy  it is a matter of very little consequence in my apprehension whether the term taken in its  scriptural  use and acceptation signify a  poet  as Mr Paine explains it or a  teacher  as Mr Wakefield maintains I am satisfied that Mr Paine's strictures contain abun∣dance of truth  Justice however requires that I should notice in this place two very palpable errors into which Mr Paine has fallen and which are very properly animadverted upon by Dr Priestley though they seem to have escaped the  lynxeyed  criticism of Mr Wakefield The first of these errors refers to Mr Paine's attempt to prove that the  pro∣phetical writings  were written in  poetical measure  by quoting passages from the  English version  The truth of the pro∣position itself at least with respect to a part is not designed to be called in question but the argument upon which Mr Paine grounds his proof is altogether nugatory and fallacious  In the second instance Mr Paine lays himself still more open to animadversion His hypothesis that there must be  degrees  in prophesying because the prophets are distin∣guished by the appellations of the  greater  and the  minor  is really calculated to raise a smile as Mr Priestley very justly observes the term having no reference whatever to the  quality  but only to the  quantity  of what these pro∣phets wrote In both cases Mr Paine is  vulnerable  and I cannot defend him  and perhaps too much to go down  palatably  in this  age of prophecy and  revelation  The axe to quote our au∣thor's own energetic language strikes im∣mediately at the root  it attacks the very  fundamentals  of Christianity the  tes∣timony of Jesus being the spirit of prophecy  Rev xix  Such being the state of the case it should seem well worth our while to bestow a little attention and enquiry upon the subject  "The supposed prophet writes our au∣thor  was the supposed historian of times to come and if he happened in shooting with a  long bow  of a thousand years to  strike within a thousand miles of the mark the ingenuity of posterity could make it pointblank and if he happened to be directly  wrong  it was only to suppose as in the case of Jonah and Nineveh that God had repented himself and changed his mind  Let us next examine Dr Priestley's state∣ment  Some parts of the book of  Daniel  and also of the  Revelation  are written in  such a manner  that it is probable we shall not understand them completely till we can compare them with the events to which they correspond  Here then let me put the question to Dr PriestleyOf what service can these pro∣phecies be allowing them even to merit the title if they are so  obscure  that they are not to be  understood  till explained and eluci∣dated by  fulfilment  And as by the term  prophecy  a prediction we apprehend is meant of certain specified events to be veri∣fied or accomplished at some future period how are we to know that the writings in question have  any claim to the title  if they be so  darkly worded  that we cannot even  ascertain  what  transactions or events they are predictive of We may on this plea wait till the  end of days  and still honour them with the  title of prophecies  in daily hopes of some event or other turning up to which our ingenuity can make these  luminous  and  universal  predictions refer for it seems they are  prophetical of the first plausible event that shall befal  But it seems the moment this  fortunate and long expected chance  turns up  it is very  possible  we may  then  be satisfied that only  He  who can see the end from the beginning could have described them  even in that obscure manner  so long before  Good bye then to prophecy if even the original Revealer of it can scarcely see his way through the  dark  himself  Yet still is our determined  champion of the faith  and it requires  great faith  indeed almost enough to remove mountains to be∣lieve on such weak unsatisfactory grounds still is he not a whit cast down nor discom∣fited He continues  The  reason  of the obscurity of  those par∣ticular prophecies concerning events which  are yet to come  is pretty obvious  Obvious  indeed for as the  fortunate chance  of an  antitype  to these  mystical allusions  has not yet turned up the believers in them are still  groping about in the dark  and like the  priests of Baal  calling upon their God to know whether he be  sleeping  or  busily engaged in granting audience to some of his newlycommissioned delegates and pro∣phets  or whether peradventure he is on a  journey in quest of fortunate chances to verify his predictions and render them intelligible  that he heareth not nor yet sendeth  one spark of fire one ray of light  to enable them to  see their way  through the  prophetical fog  in which  their senses are lost and bewildered  For as these prophecies are now in the hands of those who respect them it might have been said that they contributed to their own fulfilment by the friends of revelation endeavouring so bring about the events predicted  A curious mode of reasoning indeed What a pity these prophecies were not writ∣ten in  hieroglyphics  in which case they might possibly have been  more obscure  and  darker  still than they are in their present state However as it is I believe there is very little danger of the believers in them destroying the credit of the prophecies  after  fulfilment by incurring the suspicion of  having from their clear apprehension of them contributed to their verification  But not yet even is our doughty champion to be dispirited He has followed the ad∣vice given by the spirit to the  angel of the church of Laodicea  Rev iii and has wisely provided himself with  eye salve  that  he may see  where others are fain to  shut their eyes  and give up all hopes of extricating themselves  "Though  some  intermediate steps" by the bye I am sadly apprehensive that  all  the steps in the  prophetical ladder  are broken down since none of the admirers and advocates of the system are able to get to the  top  of it in order from the elevated station it would afford them to take a nearer  peep into futurity  and tell us when we may reasonably expect to see the fulfilment of some one or other of these glorious predic∣tions Mr  Halhed's Millenium  for instance  though some intermediate steps in the great train of events be thus obscure both the great outline of the whole and the catastrophe are most clearly expressed  Ob∣scure  as is  I wonder Mr Priestley should be perpetually harping upon this string he  should methinks have rather imitated the dutiful example of the sons of Noah and have thrown a  mantle over the nakedness of his prophets  unless indeed as not impro∣bably may be the case this charitable action is already performed by the prophets them∣selves in consequence of the  thick mantle of obscurity  and "darkness palpable" in which they have wisely taken care to wrap them∣selves up  Obscure as is the language of these prophecies they plainly enough indicate a  long period of great corruption  in Christi∣anity  methinks there is no need of either  priest  or  prophet apostle  nor  commentator  to tell us  that  Unless indeed it be for our  comfort  that we are foretold this  happy system of things  which has already continued in force a considerable length of time is likely to continue so a  great deal longer  the prophets in this respect seem to have taken

and Mr Paine I make no doubt notwithstanding his general objection to prayer will readily join us on this votive occa∣sion let us pray for the speedy  realization of this chance  lest haply we both ourselves and our little ones should all be mouldering in our graves "ages of hopeless years" before the accomplishment of this prophecy there is a  chance  however and I glory in the pleasing however

social compact of confederation as the offspring of one God and children of one common parent  Amen so be it yea let the time come quickly  temporal powers of this world in  league with it is to be overthrown and that this will be a season of  great ca∣lamity  As far as respects the latter part of the prediction I readily grant that the prophecy is and has  long been  perhaps from the time of its first delivery if not before and I fear will continue so to be  a long long time still to come  in a  state of actual fulfil∣ment  But neither was the  Vision of the Four Beasts  nor yet of the  Ram and HeGoat  nor yet the  Vision of the Four great Monarchies  see Daniel nor yet the  Visions  granted to the  visionary  writer of the  Apoca∣lypse  which according to Mr Wakefield's statement bears  such strong incontrovert∣ible  internal  symptoms of genuineness  and strong and incontrovertible and genuine  those symptoms are  of the  highest pitch of en∣thusiasm  wound up almost to  madness  nei∣ther I say were  Daniel's Visions  nor  St John's Visions  neither the  Vision of the Seven Stars and Seven golden Candlesticks  of  the Man in the midst of these Candlesticks  with feet like brass and a sharp twoedged sword in his mouth clothed with a garment down to the feet  and girt about the paps with a  golden girdle nor the  second edition  of the  Vision of the Four Beasts with its glorious apendages  nor the  Vision of the Seven Angels with the Seven Trumpets  nor the  Vision of the Woman in the Sun  who was  then  and  there delivered of a male child  from whence I suppose our  modern Jerusalem Sols  nor yet the  Vision of the Beast with Seven Heads  which allowing each head to have had  two eyes  or even only  one  eye to each head would have made a most excellent  spy  and as the Beast had moreover  ten horns  he might have acted in the double capacity of  Informer  and  Alarmist  nor yet the  Vision of the Beast with two horns coming up out of the earth  or from the  dunghill of corruption  as some inter∣preters render it and which is therefore by many learned commentators supposed to be  typical  and illustrative of our incomparable  PRIME MINISTER  for as much as  this Beast  as well as the one that preceded him is said to have had a  mouth vaunting great things  for though he had but  two horns  and those it is presumed of no great significancy or native power being  like unto the  horns of a lamb  and therefore not calculated for  warlike enterprizes  yet he  spake as a dra∣gon  and deceived them that dwell on the earth  I have in most serious contemplation and indeed I have already arranged the plan of my work to give a com∣prehensive  Commentary  on the  true and mystical  meaning of this part of  St John's Vision  its  tropes similies types allusions references  c in which I shall not fail to expa∣tiate largely and I hope satisfactorily on all and several the  characteristics  of this  marvellous Beast  I shall treat of the  fire which he maketh to come down from heavenof the miracles which he has power to do in the sight but no longer than in the sight of the other Beast  to whom he seems to look up as to his master and who is said to have  received a deadly wound  which  deadly wound  however was notwithstanding to the great admiration of all who knew him  healed  I shall moreover comment upon the  image  set up by order of  my  Beast to the  other  Beast after his recovery from the  deadly wound  of the power he has to  give life to the image  of this Beast which  image  he causes to serve his own purposes as effectually as the  Beast  itself of his  arbitrary stretch of prerogative in causing all men both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forcheads  whence some would infer the true origin of  Whig  and  Tory Jacobin  and  Alarmist  though others from what immediately follows  that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name  suppose it to allude to the  sys∣tem of taxation Exciselaws licenses c  but the beauty of  my commentary  is that it proves it to be  typical  and  demon∣strative  of  all and every one  of these opinions Lastly and here it is I propose to display my wisdom I shall give the  only  true full genuine and satisfactory comment eluci∣dation interpretation mystical meaning and real explica∣tion that ever  was  or ever  will be  given of the  number of this beast  As this work promises to prove a very expensive undertaking I propose to  publish it by subscription  and hope to get it ready for delivery against the  First of April  next  nor yet the  Vision of the GREAT  WHORE  which is the  most beautiful and sublime  of all the Visions and on which thefore I mean to publish a small Treatise dedicated to the  Maids of Honour  to appear on the  Festival of the Blessed Virgin  nor the  Vision of the Seven last Plagues  which I devoutly pray the Almighty to ward off from us as we have had plagues enough already nor yet the  Vision of Satan's capture and in∣carceration  who seems to have given his  keeper the slip and to have got among the herd of swine again  nor yet the  Vision of the  battle of GOG and MAGOG  which has been a long while determining and in the con∣test has cost us millions of lives and treasure nor yet the  Vision of the new Heaven and new Earth  which Mr  Halhed  and Mr  Bro∣thers  are in daily expectation of nor yet the  Vision of the Water and Tree of Life  both of which I wish to my heart I could trans∣plant and distribute among our troops in the West Indies nor yet the  Vision of Visions  which has made  Visionaries  of us all but which I forbear to expatiate upon and in∣deed after having successfully run through such an almost unprecedented length of sen∣tence it is proper I should be indulged a little respite to fetch breath neither I say was  this  Vision nor  all these Visions  nor  any of them  necessary to prove and point out to us the  alarming state of things  and the  general depravity of the age  which con∣sideration leads me to treat of the last sub∣ject I propose to discuss in the present workthe  radical Defects of our Religion  from whence all the  numberless abuses  which both Mr Priestley and Mr Wakefield complain of flow and  must  flow whilst we continue to believe  such monstrous doctrines  and im∣piously  honour them with the title of  God's Word  However before I finally dismiss the topic of  Prophecy  I must remark that there are in the Bible  Prophecies of a peculiar stamp  which seem to refer to no  particular event  but depend for accomplishment solely upon the  heated state of the imagination  To this class belong the major part of those  pretty melting lovesick allegories  which commen∣tators generally refer to the  mystical union between Christ and his Church  Nothing can indeed be more completely ridiculous or serve to impress us with a more contempt∣ible idea of the  Word of God  as the Bible professes to be than when we contemplate the vast pains which have been taken  to ham∣mer  out of these  prophetic writings  always in a "  train of fulfilment  This has ever been the  cantphrase  with the  pious ad∣vocates  of these  pious frauds  who by their happy dexte∣rity in refering every notable event or revolution whether in the moral or political world to some  favourite prophecy  till they  fulfil  it and  unfulfil  it again a hundred times over make  Prophecy  the  scarletcoloured Beast with seven heads and ten horns  which John saw in the wilderness that  "was and is not and yet is"  Doctor Priestley seems to have got astride on this Beast when he discants on the  Prophecies of Moses now in a state of fulfilment  see p together with the predictions of  Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel Daniel  and others It is amazing what  striking analogies  what  strong relations  and  palpable references  these  second∣sighted  sons of the prophets can discover between  types  and  prototypes  and  antitypes  and  archetypes  where plain simple reason can discover no manner of resemblance whatever It was with great truth though from a different conviction that  Werenfels  wrote on the cover of his Bible  "Hic liber est in quo quaerit sua dogmata quisque  "Invenit et pariter dogmata quisque sua"  " but never  accom∣plished  any kind of sense or meaning what∣ever What numberless folios of learned commentaries have been written to trace out  Christ  under the various  types  of  Angel Man Bird Beast Fish Insect  nay even under the type of a  stumbling stone  and  shinbreaker  Behold I lay in Sion a  stumblingstone  and  rock of offence  Rom ix  Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be  broken  but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to pieces  Math xxi  And have not equal pains been taken to dis∣cover his  Bride  the  Church  under the  mask  of a  Harlot  a  Strumpet  a  Prostitute  a  Whore  and  Adultress  one moment  reclaimed  and the next as  arrant a jilt  as ever And then  again by happy metamorphosis she is a  sweet little innocent  a  true and perfect maid  without spot or blemish a  little sister with no breasts  or a  Prince's daughter with two breasts like two young roes that are twins and with a navel like a round goblet  In short the  Bridegroom  and the  Bride  are much of a pieceare  any thing  and  every thing  as suits the convenience of the  Pro∣phet  and his  commentator  To call such a  farrago  of nonsense and absurdity the  Word of God  is a downright profanation of the  sacred name  Let it not be imagined that I indulge in this ludicrous strain from a wantonness of disposition The  revival of the claim to prophetic inspiration  renders it necessary to oppose a  barrier  to the rapid progress of delusion These  pious frauds  are in their consequences productive of very  un∣holy mischiefs  and of greater evil than many would at first sight imagine Argument and remonstrance have been in vain applied to expose the  Cheat in all its nakedness  let us try what the lighter shafts of ridicule may be able to effect    Where then it will be demanded are we to look for God's word Or hath he left himself wholly without witness Mr Paine's reply to this interesting question is truly admirable  It is only in the  creation  that all our ideas and conceptions of a  word of God  can unite The creation speaketh a uni∣versal language independently of human speech or human language multiplied and various as they are It is an everexisting original which  The truth of this position is in fact admitted by Paul himself  The invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and God∣head  And in the preceding verse he says  That which may be known of God is manifest in them for God hath shown it unto them so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glo∣rified him not as God  Rom i And I might add that the happy change which has taken place to speak in general terms in our  pulpitharangues  is of itself no mean corroboration of the truth of the principles contained in the  Age of Reason  in as much as our  pious orators of the church  except it be on a day of particular celebrity such as a  holiday  a day of  fast  or  thanksgiving  or a day appropriated for the discussion of certain crabbed knotty points of the Christian faith such for instance as  Trinity Sunday  chiefly confine their weekly lectures to the principles of morality which certainly must edify their congregations infinitely more than  nonsensical wranglings upon incomprehensibilities which have not the smallest ten∣dency to reform and meliorate the heart  every man can read It cannot be forged it cannot be counter∣feited  it cannot be lost it cannot be altered it cannot be suppressed It does not depend upon the will of man whether it shall be published or not it publishes itself from one end of the earth to the other It preaches to all nations and to all worlds and this  word of God  reveals to man  all  that is necessary for man to know of God  Were it my design to turn  panegyrist  to Mr Paine I might find ample scope for my talents in this one single beautiful and com∣prehensive sentence It contains every thing that can be said either in  savor of the real word of God  or in  detraction of the counterfeit  The comparatively small part of the terra∣queous globe which even at this day after a lapse of more than three thousand years has any knowledge of the  written word of God  as professed to be contained either in the  Jewish  or  Christian scriptures  must in the eye of reason furnish a strong and insur∣mountable objection to the  divinity of these books  in as much as a revelation of the Cre∣ator's will undoubtedly ought to extend to  all  his creatures and not depend upon chance and circumstances for promulagtion  An earthly sovereign who issues an edict or makes known his pleasure to his subjects is particularly careful that his proclamation shall be promulgated as universally as possible in order that disobedience may have no shadow of excuse If he be a king over many na∣tions and people of different tongues and languages bow down before him he gives orders to have his proclamation translated into all those languages that every one may read it in his  vernacular  tongue These are measures of precaution and expediency which justice demands and the application of this proposition to  revelation or the word of God  holds strictly good  How shall they believe in him of whom they have not  heard  and how shall they  hear  without a  preaches  and how shall parsons  preach  ex∣cept they be  sent  Rom x  Univer∣sality  therefore as the laws of God extend equally to the  whole human race  becomes an indispensible requisite in whatever lays claim to the title of  God's word  and as the scrip∣tures cannot boast this indispensible requisite they must relinquish their pretensions  The  oldest  religion I proceed now to the last object of my discussions as specified  above of which we have any authentic and credible accounts is  Judaism  Not that I suppose mankind were entirely devoid of all religious notions the reverse is evident from scripture itself till Moses received a  divine commission  to be the  Founder of Judaism  but whatever their religion was considered in the light of a  system  it is now impossible for us to ascertain They worshipped idols and probably the heavenly bodies particu∣larly the  sun  and  moon  as from these they derived the blessings of heat and light  Moses whose views appear to have been no less than the establishment of  Universal Hierarchy  formed a system most admirably adapted to promote his ambitious views He was originally the son of an obscure Is∣raelite saved by stealth as the book of Ex∣odus informs us from being put to death in his infancy in pursuance of the edict of the king of Egypt to which country the ancestors of Moses had emigrated to escape  Such was the amazing fertility of Egypt that it was styled by way of eminence the  Granary of the Romans  Agriculture did not require more than  one ninth  of the labour which it calls for in England nothing more was necessary than to sow and water the land yielded in incre∣dible abundance insomuch that it supplied Italy under Justinian with nearly forty millions of quarterns annually  starvation at a time of general scarcity and  famine At the age of three months his mother being no longer able to conceal him at home with safety he is put into an ark of bullrushes and set adrift in the Nile In this deplorable situation he is discovered by Pharaoh's daughter whose compassion in∣duces her to take care of him and Moses is educated at Pharaoh's court where he is  initiated into all the wisdom of the Egyptians  When advanced to manhood he discovers a  turbulent  disposition  Here I hold myself prepared and ready for attack The man Moses we are told and told by  himself  into the bargain and surely he ought to have been the best judge of his own feelings  was a  very meek man  above all the men which were upon the face of the earth  Numbers xii Greatly am I led to doubt the justice of the cha∣racter which Moses here gives us of himself and strong and cogent are my reasons for doubting it They may however be expressed in very few words I call in doubt his  written character of himself  because it is flatly contra∣dicted by his  actions  He seeth an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew and straitway his spirit waxeth hot and he falleth upon and stayeth the Egyptian  Heroic  as this action might otherwise appear were it not for two untoward cir∣cumstances the  odds  against the Egyptian and the  looking of Moses  this way  and  that way  Exod ii to assure himself that he was safe I greatly doubt whether it can be construed by any polemical ambidexterity whatever into a proof of  extraordinary meekness  Again when the seven daughters of the priest of Midian are rudely driven away from the watering troughs by the shepherds men seem to have entertained very strange notions of  gallantry  in those days Moses as every gentlemen ought to have done in such a case feels his blood begin to boil he standeth up takes the part of the distressed damsels and delivereth them out of the hands of the shepherds Exod ii I am not finding fault with this action on the contrary I great∣ly admire it it evinces much more true heroism for here we see  one  engaged against  many  than the former instance All I contend for is that it does not satisfy me as to the  meek∣ness  of the man Neither can his  meekness  I apprehend be argued from the circumstance of his dashing in pieces in the intemperance of his zeal the two tables of the com∣mandments which God himself according to his account had been at the trouble of engraving for him nor yet from the history of  Korah's rebellion  when Moses is said to have been very  wroth  Numbers xvi and indeed he had reason  to be wroth  for Korah seems to have aimed at no∣thing less than  supplanting him  wherefore Moses  very charitably  prays the Lord to have  no respect unto their of∣ferings  and puts an end to the rebellion by  under∣mining  those who were plotting to  undermine him  Num∣bers xvi Nor yet can we prove his meekness from his  smiting  the rock in a passion instead of  intreating it kindly  Numbers xx for which  extraordinary proof of meekness  he was doomed to perish in the wilderness with∣out entering the land of Promise nor yet from the order he gave unto the Judges "to slay every man his neigh∣bour" Numbers xxv nor yet from his being  wroth  with the officers of the host because they had saved the  women  and  children  alive whom Moses very  humanely  commands them to  butcher  reserving however the  females who had not parted with their virginity for themselves  Numbers xxxi Moses being  greatly incensed  against the  Midianites  because they had seat a deputation to  Balaam  the man with the  wonderful ass  under the sup∣position of his being a  greater prophet  than Moses himself Numbers xxii Neither I say can this last instance nor any of the former instances I have enumerated satisfy me of the  meekness  of Moses The fact is Moses supposing the writings in question to be actually his own was no more a novice in the art of writing  Commentaries  than  Julius Caesar  or the most enlightened writer of his own memoirs among the moderns but I am ever apt to distrust the praises which people bestow upon themselves  interferes in the  quarrels between his countrymen and the Egyptians kills one of the latter in a fray  and to avoid the punishment of his crime for the laws of the Egyptians relative to murder were exceedingly  severe  So severe indeed that not only the  actual perpetration  of murder but the  nonprevention  likewise of the crime were pu∣nishable with death  he escapes into the land of Midian  Here after marrying the daughter of the shepherd whose flocks he tended he grows dissatisfied with his humble condition and plans schemes of future aggrandizement Being born to no dominions he must either acquire them by conquest or be content to continue shepherd Conquests are not made without armies and as Moses has no troops he must study the means of raising them He had observed the hatred which the Is∣raelites entertained against the Egyptians to whom they were vassals he forms the plan of inciting them to revolt and making them the instruments of his ambition  For this purpose he pretends a  divine mis∣sion  from God accompanied with a  grant of certain lands  the situation of which he deemed eligible With  these credentials  he returns to Egypt encourages his country∣men to emancipate themselves and having prepared them for his purpose endeavours to circumvent Pharaoh by preferring an insi∣dious request for leave of absence for the Israelites that they may go  three days journey  into the wilderness and  Thus we see the practice of making religion the  tool of politics  is not of modern invention  sacrifice to their  God Pharaoh however had it seems rea∣son to mistrust the sincerity of his zeal having perhaps received secret intimation of his real design and therefore not only flatly refuses to grant his request but gives orders moreover to keep a stricter hand over the Is∣raelites than before The consequence is the Israelites finding themselves treated with aggravated rigour remonstrate with Moses and seem willing to relinquish the design of recovering their liberty Moses however succeeds in dissuading them and having suf∣ficiently confirmed their wavering resolution repeats his crafty request to Pharaoh but with no better success than before  A long series of plots and insidious ma∣chinations  The length to which this publieation has already swelled prevents me from entering into the merits of the reputed miracles wrought by Moses It is not however improbable but I may be induced to give a criticism of the  history of the emigration of the Jews  in some future publication of which I have already col∣lected the chief materials  now ensues with  some feats  of  legerdemain  which Moses being more expert at than the magicians of Pharaoh's court he at length imposes upon the king who grants the Israelites permission to decamp No  sooner however are the latter upon the march which they took care not to enter upon till they had  very genteelly  picked the pockets of their late acquaintanceExod xii than Pharaoh receiving posi∣tive information that Moses and the Is∣raelites under his command had no intention of returning back to vassallage but that their pretended pilgrimage to serve the Lord their God in the wilderness was a mere stratagem to effect their escape determines to pursue the fugitives and coming up with them towards  evening  This seems to be the true  pillar of the Cloud  which stood between the Israelites and the Egyptians Exod xiv  is either  drowned  in at∣tempting to  ford  the Red Sea at the place where the Israelites passed through it but which was now no longer fordable the wa∣ters having returned or else he sounds a retreat and orders his troops home again leaving the Israelites to pursue their route unmolested  Our adventurer has now got a considerable number of subjects for whom he has no∣thing to do but provide a place to settle in As it was necessary to violate all the laws of  of justice and humanity in seizing upon the territories of other states for none were willing to resign their lands up to him he pretends that the grant he had received from God of certain pleasant lands which suited his purpose not only authorized the invasion of those lands but moreover enjoined him to butcher and totally extirpate the original in∣habitants sparing neither men women nor children Thus by an alledged commandment from the Almighty are the hearts of the Israelites steeled to all the cruelties and enor∣mities which they afterwards perpetrated  Seeing himself at the head of a nume∣rous and of course powerful nation Moses turns his thoughts to secure the continuance of that power which he had so successfully and artfully usurped For this purpose he gives a  code of laws  to the Israelites which like those of  Draco  may be said to be  written in blood  throws all the power into the hands of  the priesthood  which he makes  he∣reditary  in his  own  tribe of Levi because their progenitor was a bloodthirsty ruffian and cutthroat Gen xxiv con∣secrates his brother Aaron  highpriest  and confirms the despotism of his  hierarchy  by  making the priests  keepers of the oracles  and  interpreters of the law  to the people As for himself he fills no one particular office but is the  all in all  of the system  That a religion founded upon such prin∣ciples as these must inevitably tend to bru∣talize the heart and lead to the most dia∣bolical actions is selfapparent Nothing can be closer than the intimate connection be∣tween religion and morals The Jewish his∣tory furnishes a striking proof of the justice of this maxim It exhibits little else to our view than a black catalogue of the most atro∣cious crimes that ever disgraced human na∣nature Murders rapes enormities of every kind at the bare mention of which huma∣nity recoils with horror appear on every page A captive king is cut in pieces in cool blood  before the Lord  in Gilgal by the reputed prophet of the Almighty and the Con∣queror whose humanity induced him to spare the life of his unhappy prisoner is declared to have forfeited his crown and to be rejected of the Lord because he obeyed not the word of his prophet who commanded him to  smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they had and spare them not but slay  both man and woman infant and suck∣ling ox and sheep camel and ass  Sam xv Such was the blessed spirit of the Jewish dispensation so highly valued in Mr Wakefield's eyes under which the sim∣ple act of gathering sticks to light a fire on the Sabbathday was punished with a tor∣turing death Numbers xv  Let us now turn our eye to the  Christian System  The leading feature of  this  scheme is  Redemption  The  Christian Scriptures  con∣cur with the  Jewish Chronicles  in inform∣ing us that man deviating from the line of rectitude by listening to the seductions of wayward appetite  I state the proposition in Mr Wakefield's own words see page to give it in its most unexceptionable form  entailed  death  and  misery  upon all his numerous posterity not  one  of whom  Enoch  and  Elijah  excepted and why  they  should be excepted we see no reason escape the punishment due to Adam's disobedience though not one of them accessary to his crime  Nearly four thousand years elapse man continuing all that time to suffer the pu∣nishment  of a guilt he had not incurred when a Saviour is born in Bethlehem whether by  divine conception  or not is nothing to the present question This illustrious personage is held up as the  scape goat  of the whole human race who is to expiate the guilt in∣curred by the original transgressor  Both these doctrines therefore proceed upon one and the same principle The one damns all mankind for a  guilt  in which one only pair excepted they had no  participa∣tion  and the other professes to save these wretched victims for the  merit  of another in which they were equally  neuter  Thus injustice forms the grand characteristic of them both  The glaring absurdity and as I said be∣fore injustice of this scheme are so ably pointed out by Mr Paine whose  notion of Redemption  I conceive to be a very just one though possibly derived from his  father  's  See Mr Wakefield p  instruction that I forbear to go over the ground he has already so successfully trodden However to state one argument which I do  not find urged by our Author I object to Re∣demption exclusive of every other con∣sideration on the plea that  justice  is not done by it to man  Adam transgresses and his whole poste∣rity is doomed to  die  This doom is carried into most rigorous execution for not one our two Old Testament worthies excepted escape its force As  Here I am well aware of a whole host of quibblers that will not fail to fall foul upon me with their ridiculous distinction between  natural  death and  spiritual  death but to give them their fullest swing they must allow that  natural death  if it did not constitute the  whole  of Adam's punishment forms however a  part  and this concession granted and grant it they  must  my argument holds equally good  death  therefore was the punishment denounced against sin it was impossible for  any  Redemption to take place after the punishment had once been actually inflicted Unless indeed as soon as the proxyexpiation was effected those who had already paid the forfeit that is to say all the persons who have died from Adam to Christ had been restored to life for if I am arrested for a debt and a friend is generous enough to discharge it for me I am no longer de∣tained in prison  Again allowing even the  possibility  of Redemption nay I will go a step further and suppose it to have  actually taken place  still I maintain that  justice  is not done to man by it Adam's transgression damns me  ipso facto  without any act of mine I have a right therefore when Redemption is held out to my view to expect that I shall benefit by it upon the  same terms  I have a right to stand  neuter  in the business and as I am damned by  Adam's Fall  whether I pro∣fess to believe in it or not I have a right to benefit by  Christ's Redemption  whether I make it my creed of faith or not Upon any other terms this Redemption becomes partial and unjust  Having thus stated the inconsistency of the scheme in  theory  I proceed to try its merits by the touchstone of  practice  It is by the  fruit  that we judge of the  tree  and even the Christian scheme allows the justice of this principle I have already shown the intimate connexion between Mo∣rals and Religion in the case of  Judaism  I shall now discuss the same topic with refer∣ence to  Christianity  Deeds  constituted the merit of the  Jewish  system Faith  constitutes the merit of the  Christian  The  b  st Jew  was the man that conformed most scrupulously to the outward ceremonies of the Levitical law the  best Christian  is the man who has the strongest faith The sinner who transgressed against any ordinance of the Mosaic dispensation not punishable with death was made to  smart  for his crime by the  forfeit  he had to pay under the name of an  offering  Under the Christian dispensation the most damnable sins provided they do not offend against the statute may be committed one moment and repented of the next and pardoned to boot without costing the sinner one farthing un∣less he has the misfortune for such I must consider it in this light to belong to the Ro∣mish church in which case he will have to pay but I believe the terms are pretty mo∣derate for absolution  Whether he pays however or not whe∣ther he be a disciple of the Church of Rome or a disciple of the church of England it makes no difference as to his conduct In the former case he can buy a licence to sin on with impunity for three or four or a dozen years together according as his purse  holds out in the latter he may sin and pay nothing but then the Protestant who does not pay must be at the trouble of repenting which the Catholic who pays has no need to do Thus they stand both nearly upon a level Now let us see what good effects this blessed Religion produces in their practice  The Christians long persecuted by the Jews and Pagans no sooner get out of the fire themselves than they begin to thrust others into it They retaliate upon the Jews they retaliate upon the Pagans and when they have no common enemies to persecute they fall out among themselves and begin to worry each other Their religion at length branches out into two distinct ramisications which is not to be wondered at as I have already demonstrated Christianity to be  theo∣retical  whereas Judaism was  practical  These two  branches  though originating from the  same stem  harbour greater hatred to each other than if they were  rival trees  Per∣secution rages hotter now than ever the elder branch being the most powerful as matured and invigorated by age carries it awhile with a high and daring hand At length the younger branch attains to suffi∣cient  growth and vigour to dispute the day and retaliates in its turn upon the elder branch Thus they continue worrying each other till their mutual interests compel them to live more neighbourly together but neither should a single leaf on the Pro∣testant branch enjoy one visit from the genial beams of the sun if the Catholics could pre∣vent it nor the same blessing be allowed to the leaves of the Catholic branch if the Pro∣testants had it in their power to cast a shade upon them  The disqualification of the Catholics and Dissenters to hold places under our government sit in cur senate pass their degrees in our Universities with various other illiberal restrictions bear ample evidence to the truth of my assertion  Religion being thus made to consist in faith or in other words in opinion and opin∣ions being as various as there are heads to harbour those opinions the most absurd and monstrous doctrines are engrafted upon it Hence we hear talk of  standing up for our religion  which is or ought to be well able to stand up for itself of  I am grieved to think that we are at the very moment that I write these pages  sighting  for  religion  in our  crusade  against the French  fighting for  our religion  though the founder of it would not permit the sword to be drawn in his own defence of  dying for our religion  which is nearly as absurd as fighting for it religion being intended for the happiness of man and not for an  ignis fatuus  to lead him into destruction of  making Proselytes to our religion  which if possible is more absurd still as religion should be left to beat up recruits for itself of  reforming our reli∣gion  which if it stands in need of reform is better totally rejected of  establishing our religion  which God has taken care to do himself when he first laid down the immu∣table laws of nature of  proving our religion  which if it be not the religion of nature will be found not worth the proof of  bring∣ing our religion to the test  which none but natural religion can ever stand of  supporting our religion  which if it wants support from man should be left to fall to the ground Hence likewise in  practice  we are guilty of the most ridiculous absurdities and whilst we style our God the  Prince of peace  at whose birth the angels rent the air with loud acclaims of  Tidings of great joy peace upon earth and good will to men  we call  upon him to bless our slaughtering arms and hang up the shattered standards and blood∣distained trophies of our enemies in his con∣secrated temples  But here steps in Mr Wakefield with his famous plea  Ab abusu ad usum non valet con∣sequentia  I admit the proposition in its fullest extent But first let him demonstrate to me the  use  of the thing for which we are contending I defy him to do it But should he even succeed in discovering and substantiating  some degree of use  it still re∣mains to be ascertained whether the  use  atones for the  abuse  whether it prepon∣derates in the scale When I see nothing but  abuse  from first to last nothing but  corruption  throughout when I see nothing but  fraud  and  deception  I fear that his  "Abusus non tollit usum"  will stand him in little stead Let him prove to me that we have less uncharitableness less unmerciful∣ness less vindictiveness in the world I am speaking in general terms of mankind at large and not arguing from individuals since the introduction of the Christian sys∣tem let him prove that we have fewer ani∣mosities fewer wars less bloodshed less  butchering of our fellowcreatures and that often under the mask of religion  How many millions of lives have been saorificed at the shrine of Christianity in the  holy  wars against the  Sara∣cens  in the  crusades  against the  Hussites Hugonots  c  let him prove and establish these important points and I shall readily acknowledge myself his convert Till then however I must make bold to believe with Mr Paine that the CREATION IS THE ONLY TRUE AND REAL WORD OF GOD that ever did or will exist and that every thing else called the  Word of God  is fable and imposition  London  October
