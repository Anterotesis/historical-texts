proper Names  A TRIP to the MOON  CHAP I  Containing a short Account of Sir HUMPHREY's Predecessors from the first BARONET of his Family  THOUGH the following Piece is not of a Biographical Nature the Author thinks it necessary to give some short Account of himself and his Family that thereby forming a Kind of Acquaintance with his Readers they may pursue their Journey together thro' the LUNAR WORLD with more Cordiality and Pleasure  It is well known by those who have Skill in Heraldry that the LUNATICS  have been a considerable Family ever since  ENGLAND  WAS ENGLAND they have occasionally been at the Helm of State they have nodded upon WoollPacks in Lawn Sleeves they have dispensed Law from under Voluminous Wigs they have ravaged Nations with Armies and plowed the Deep with Fleets in short they have filled every Station in Life from Princes to Coblers from Duchesses to Chambermaids To make a complete Detail of Genealogical Particulars would be a Work of insufferable Prolixity and Ostentation wherefore the AUTHOR will only revert to his Great Grandfather the first BARONET of  his  Part of the Family and proceed from him in a direct Line without Regard to several other distinguished collateral Branches  WHIMSICAL LUNATIC  Esq  afterwards Sir WHIMSICAL distinguished himself much by his Zeal in Favour of Royalty at that Critical Period when the  REPUBLICAN Party made such severe Attacks upon the weak and unfortunate FIRST CHARLES nor did he like the mercenary slaves of Interest attach himself till Rebellion had so far gained the Ascendant that Hope was fluttering on its last Wing not PERSIAN like a Worshipper of the rising but a faithful follower of the setting Sun pursuing his Beams even into the profound Darkness that ensued with a Spirit truly heroic he join'd the general Wreck which depriv'd the Monarch of his Life and himself among many others of his Estate  Thus reduced for some Time he comforted himself with the Opinion of CATO that it is a necessary Compliment in every good Citizen to join the Ruin of his Country However Want of Money which generally gives Time for Reflection and adds Force to it soon led him to entertain a different Notion of  the prevailing Party through the Optics of Necessity fresh Notions of Freedom entered his ever active Brain Nonresistance and Passive Obedience his darling Principles vanished like Mists before the Sun and a new Kind of Patriotism so enflamed him that he commenced one of those publicspirited Orators since disgraced by the Title of Fanatic Preachers  Being possessed of great Volubility Force of Expression and Luxuriance of Fancy he soon became highly distinguished in his New Capacity and as Converts are generally most zealous against the Cause they have forsaken he was esteemed so valuable an Acquisition that CROMWELL caused his Estate to be restored and had him elected a Member of his first PARLIAMENT in which Situation he made a very considerable Figure No one in the Debates commanded  more Attention and Respect Hence he might have been eminently advanced in the State but like a true LUNATIC being fond of Opposition and disdaining to run with the Stream long he began to find Fault with the Conduct of Public Affairs openly declaring that the Plan of PLATO'S REPUBLIC with some Alterations and Amendments of his own would be the only sure Foundation for National Happiness  His Objections to almost every Measure proposed rendered him remarkably obnoxious within Doors but made him popular without however as in those days the VOX POPULI was not esteemed the VOX DEI he reaped no other Advantage from his hardy and anxious Endeavours but some faint Gales of whispered Applause for public Acclamations in Favour of laborious Patriots were not  then so common or so safe as they have been since  Plumed up and animated with the Approbation of many as discontented as himself he gave full Scope to his Zeal without apparently waking the Dragon Power from his Slumbers as his Keepers shrewdly foresaw that to lie in Wait for hotbrained Politicians is the surest Method of circumventing them And even so it happened with the illustrious Personage here spoken of who grew so extremely violent upon the Motion for constituting CROMWELL LORD PROTECTOR which he said was only a softer Name for TYRANT that his Fury knew no Bounds but hurried him to such Lengths of general and personal Reflection that he was not only expelled the House as a seditious Member but was also put under legal Prosecution and amerced with so heavy a Fine for Defamation that his Estate could  stretch little farther than to save him from a Prison  Thus once again sunk into the unhospitable and chilling Shade of Fortune he had no Comfort left but the Uprightness of his own Heart and some distant Hopes that Matters might yet take a more favourable Turn which however did not happen till some short Time before CROMWELL'S Decease when a rich Relation dying he obtained a Legacy that redeemed his Estate and enabled him to appear in public with Respect for Respect usually follows the Circumstances and not the Qualifications of a Man  At this Period as if his Life had not been already sufficiently disturbed he took it into his Head to marry a second Wife his own Housekeeper who being raised to the Degree of Mistress possessed  of Youth without Prudence and Beauty without Understanding made such large Strides to arbitrary Power that all her Husband's REPUBLICAN Principles could not stem the Torrent of her Pride and Extravagance This domestic Concern kept him from meddling any further in Politics than addressing his Life and Fortune among the other good People of ENGLAND to RICHARD CROMWELL some Years Poverty having made him approve of the Office of PROTECTOR However upon hearing of CHARLES'S Approach his Heart took such a Yearning towards the lawful Prince and indefeasible hereditary Right flowed back upon him in such a Tide of Loyalty that he was one of the foremost to transfer Allegiance from RICHARD to CHARLES in Acknowledgment of which forward Zeal that goodhumour'd liberal Monarch created him a BARONET intimating at the same Time a Design when  Affairs were entirely settled of extending his Royal Bounty in a Manner more worthy his great Deservings  But alas how vain transitory and delusive are human Expectations How speedily does the evergaping Grave swallow up the airbuilt Fabrics of Imagination Some few Nights after his new Dignity had been conferred upon him the BARONET while his heart was expanding with Joy at his Country's Felicity sacrificed so profusely at the Shrine of BACCHUS and swallowed so many Bumpers for the PUBLIC GOOD that falling asleep among some as much intoxicated as himself he was as is supposed stifled being found dead in his Chair by a Waiter Thusoh fatal and irreparable Chancedied that great Man who expired as he had lived in the Cause of old ENGLAND a real and uniform LUNATIC  As Impartiality is the very Essence of History it shall be most carefully preserved upon this Occasion wherefore tho' Nature may plead to draw a Veil over the Failings of Ancestors yet our Author cannot help acknowledging that Sir WHIMSICAL'S Successor deviated considerably from the Dignity of his Name and Family for notwithstanding he had so bright an Example before him to light him on his Way like another ARCADIAN STAR and came to his Estate in a bustling Time yet did he meanly betake himself to the Retirement of a Country Life making the Improvement of his Fortune the comfortable Settlement of his Tenants a plentiful House and half a Dozen sociable Neighbours his chief Pleasure However this phlegmatic Cloud as I may call him upon the Glory of the LUNATICS complaisantly retired in seven or eight Years and made Way for Sir HUMPHREY Father of the Author  Here FamilySplendor again began to break forth the young BARONET first distinguished himself eminently upon the famous Bill of Exclusion so boldly framed against JAMES Duke of YORK afterwards King During the short Reign of that obstinate Prince he alternately supported Royal Prerogative and popular Liberty so being of both Sides reaped Advantage from neither He was not in the Association for inviting the Prince of ORANGE yet joined him soon after his Arrival notwithstanding which he was always one of the foremost to cramp that Monarch in the Operations of Government The War of Queen ANNE he vehemently declared against and when the War was ended was as vehement against the Peace of UTRECHT just after which he died expiring with this Wish that the Authors of  such  a Peace might never enjoy  Peace  In short he was deeply concerned in the political Occurrences of  fiveandthirty Years fully inheriting the glorious Spirit of Opposition and exerting it with such Effect that he was the main Cause of removing a Dozen Ministers of State most of whom he thought honest till in Office but became convinced at last by repeated Experience that if at any Time PLACEHUNTERS do act upon just Principles and are uncorrupt their Virtue can only be compared to that of those Women who are chaste for want of Temptation or Opportunity  Our AUTHOR was at the Time of his Father's Decease but twelve Years old and by his Will put under the Guardianship of a Person who had strict Charge to inspire him with the Love of some occult Science which might render him famous Accordingly his Genius being consulted Astronomy was fixed upon in which he made an astonishing Progress but as he is still alive and an Actor on this great Stage  of Life we shall leave his Character and Portrait to a future Day that we may not incur the Charge of Flattery or Malice by pointing out Beauties or Defects  Be it sufficient then to remark that the present Sir HUMPHREY tho' intimately acquainted with all Political Concerns tho' a faithful Representative of his Constituents yet has taken a different Method to the immortalizing his Name and embalming it for Posterity viewing terrestrial Concerns where scarce any Thing but SelfLove and its Train of sordid Consequences prevails but as secondary Points of Care to a wise Man He has studiously traversed the whole Planetary System and tho' some worldly Grubs may look on him as a mere Stargazer the following Account of his TRIP TO THE MOON will show that he deserves as exalted a Place in the Rolls of FAME as any LUNATIC that ever  made a Figure in Life having this Advantage over his Predecessors of conspicuous Memory that his Fame is in the humblest View founded upon innocent not destructive Principles upon universal wondrous Philosophical Harmony not violent destructive Political Dissension  In this Sense he has consented to submit himself and the following Journal to public Opinion persuaded that however peculiar the Things he is to relate may appear daily Experience proves they are not less true for being strange and he even flatters himself that they may not be less entertaining because derived from a Country and People seldom mentioned in our World for it is a Country much to be admired and a People in many Points highly deserving Imitation  CHAP II  Sir HUMPHREY's Translation to the MOON his Reception in the Island of NOIBLA Ceremony at the NOTLAM and his Entry into the City of NODNOL  HAving always attentively busied myself in the Contemplation of those innumerable and wonderful Bodies which catching Light from the Sun when he descends below our Hemisphere adorn the Firmament with golden Specks for such they seem to unassisted mortal Eyes and being always extremely curious to examine whatever related to those Bodies I form'd great Expectations from a Piece which once fell into my Hands called BERGERAC'S VOYAGE to the MOON the Title indeed gave me particular Pleasure as I hoped to find somewhat very extraordinary in the Contents yet was I vastly deceived for tho'  there are strong Marks of Genius in that Production upon the whole I could discover nothing very interesting however the Thought of a Journey to the LUNAR WORLD struck very deep and all my Calculations all my Wishes were ever after assiduously employed on the effecting such a Jaunt till at last without any apparent Merit of mine it happened in the following Manner  The latter End of last MAY taking a nightly Walk of Contemplation I ascended a green Hill of considerable Height whose Top was shaded with Trees from whence in awful Silence broke only by lulling Notes from the plaintive Nightingale I beheld below me a spacious Vale intersected by the slow and stately Stream of a wellknown River skirted by a venerable Grove whose Branches as SHAKESPEAR has it were silvered by the MOONSHINE'S  watry Beams  that Planet  having then filled its Orb with most unusual Lustre wrapped up in pleasing Melancholy Slumber insensibly fell upon me and from thence I dropp'd into a profound Sleep  How long this soft Semblance of Death remained upon me I cannot say but imagine Reader if thou canst my Surprize and let me add some Terror also when upon waking I found myself seated in a Kind of Triumphal Car surrounded by a great Number of human Figures not one of which I had the least Idea of yet all shewing many Marks of Respect and murmuring out an extraordinary Kind of Joy My Astonishment being too visible for Disguise a Person of venerable Aspect addressed me as follows most profound Attention being given by the surrounding Crowd who seemed to have much more Pleasure in the Practice  of good Manners than many of our polite Assemblies  SON of EARTH said he fear not thou art in the Regions of Safety Tenderness and Hospitality ever smile here Envy never shewed her snaky Locks nor Slander her envenom'd Tongue nor Cruelty her bloodstain'd Sword in these Realms of soft Repose rejoice therefore that thou art so highly favoured as to have an Opportunity of gratifying that Curiosity which has so long possessed thee it was laudably ambitious and stirred up to raise thee above the common Race of Men Receive from me in Behalf of all present and of a much greater Number whom we represent a zealous and unaffected Welcome may every Thing thou meet'st during thy Stay amongst us contribute to thy Information and Pleasure it shall be our Care to consult and to  romote both May our Endeavours be  uccessful to thy Approbation  Here turning round and repeating to  e Multitude a few Words which I did  ot understand they again made Obei  nce Having by this Time collected  onfidence I replied  VENERABLE SAGE whom yet I know  ot either in Person or Dignity how shall  fitly acknowledge this most hospitable  alutation How pay the due Respect to  ch unmerited Kindness Yet let it not  and as a Doubt of that Cordiality you  ofess to ask where I am and by what Means I came hither both being utterly  nknown to me You Sir by your Lan  uage and Appearance are ENGLISH yet  any I see around you so different from  hat I have ever seen before that I am most persuaded to believe some super  tural Means have removed me from  my native Land besides however conspicuous BRITAIN may be in the Rolls of Fame the Character you give of this untainted Region far surpasses her proudest Boast wherefore good Sir you cannot be displeased if I inquire where and among whom I am at present placed  Thy Desire my Son returns he is natural and that thou may'st not be kep  longer in Suspence know that what tho  hast so long earnestly wished is at lengt  come to pass thou art now within the Limits of th  LUNAR WORLD the imperceptible Method of thy Conveyanc  I cannot explain to thy Comprehension let it suffice to say that some Rays of Attraction sent down from the Mount o  Observation a Spot which from Eart  appears to be the Nose of the MAN i  the MOON drew thee from the Plac  where thou lay'st asleep which powerfu  Operation was not a little facilitated by  ome sympathetic Pamphlets thou hadst  n thy Pockets Pieces originally planned  n a certain Province of this LUNAR WORLD and thence inspired into the  oonstruck  Authors of them Upon this  nformation examining my Pockets I  ound three of WHITEFIELD'S Sermons  alf a Dozen NORTHBRITONS and as  any Schemes for paying off the Na  ional Debt by JACOB HENRIQUES  At this Point of Time my HOST as I  ay call my sage Welcomer directed a  ind of Procession which tho' not grand  or very regular appeared to be calcula  ed as a high Compliment to me my  ar of State was drawn by six Animals  wo of a Sort with a Youth of about fif  een leading each they were ELEPHANTS HORSES and LIONS all remarkable in  heir Kinds the ELEPHANTS were of  hose which so remarkably contributed to  Victory in a Battle between the ROMANS and PYRRHUS the Horses were BUCEPHALUS and that on which CURTIUS leap'd into the gaping Gulph for the Good of his Country and as to the LIONS one of those that let DANIEL pass unmolested was paired with him that gratefully remembered the Slave who freed his Foot from a tormenting Thorn These as well as many extraordinary Creatures of the Human Species had been translated to the MOON and are there held in great Regard  I was shaded by a thin silken Canopy held over me with great Exactness by six EAGLES of the SUN their Plumes shining like his Beams whose Wings kept Pace with the Car and fanned the Breezes very agreeably around me A Band of Music preceded the Car not much unlike that Kind of rude Harmony with which we are told the Antients saluted the  MOON in an Eclipse supposing her to be at that Time in Labour  As we approached a Gate which I perceived led into the City we stopped before a beautiful Arbor formed by a Circle of most pleasing correspondent Trees within this Arbor stood a small neat Building which inclosed a Well called the NOTLAM or SPRING of PURIFICATION I was led towards it being told that I was to undergo a Ceremony necessary to every  Sublunary  Being before his Admission into the City  On each Side the Well stood six beautiful Virgins in flowing Robes of Azure each holding in her Hand something like a Censer of transparent Chrystal On my Entrance one of them with the most courteous Solemnity slowly approached me and according to my Conductor's Interpretation spoke thus  May'st thou earthborn Mortal by drinking of this holy Spring become as cold to Passion and as pure to Virtue as its deep and lucid Stream  Having ended and presented me the Water she retired when a second came forward and sprinkling my Hands said  May these be the Instruments of Industry and not of Violence  A third my Breast being bared sprinkled it with these Words  May Content ever dwell here and social Hoppiness be the reigning Principle  A fourth bedewed my Head saying  As Heaven's kindly Rain raises and cherishes the vegetable World so may these consecrated Drops here bring forth the Fruits of Wisdom and Virtue  So much of the Ceremony being over the TWELVE VIRGINS circling round me dancing all the Time with very odd Gestures and singing a Hymn of Exultation gave me so plentiful an Ablution that I began to be weary Having finished  these Rites they all prostrated them  elves before me and then retired to their  laces on each Side the WELL  Sensible of the Pains they had taken  nd forgetting where I was I intended to  ave made a pecuniary Acknowledge  ent but my HOST perceiving the De  ign Hold SON of EARTH says he the Works of Religion and Hospitality are  ot sold here nor have we any Coin but  ocial Intercourse and mutual Regard  id I not tell thee we had no Envy or Dis  ord among us and after that could'st  hou imagine any Regard would be paid  o such Dross as Gold Did we want to  troduce Flames among our Fields  earth among our Cattle Dissensions  mong our Families Bloodshed into our  ities Diseases into our Bodies and pe  ilential Passions into our Minds that  flammatory Trash would soon effect our  ational and vicious Purposes Yet  hold one pleasing and useful Purpose the Sight of it may serve lend me what thou hast that displaying it to public View and briefly explaining its pernicious Effects I may render it if possible still more contemptible and hateful to my Brethren of this World  Here I gave him my Purse from whence taking some Pieces of Gold he held them in each Hand and addressed the Multitude in the following Manner as he afterwards explained it to me  Behold my Friends and Brothers of the ISLAND of NOIBLA the most favoured Spot of all this LUNAR WORLD behold ye Sons of natural and untainted Liberty the Fiend who having got Footing on the Terrestrial Globe rules every Government and every Individual of all Sexes Ages and Degrees for the Sake of Bits like these dug  by halffed Slaves  out of the Bowels of the Earth to pamper Pride and Luxury thousands and ten Thousands march into the bloody Field of War hung round with the most destructive Weapons of Cruelty to mutilate and butcher their FellowCreatures for these their Clergy pray their Lawyers wrangle their Physicians kill For these Fathers and their Sons Mothers and their Daughters Brethren and Sisters run into the most uncharitable Dissensions Gilded with these Vice claims Respect while thread bare Virtue stands shiv'ring and helpless at the unhospitable Doors of Luxury and Pride  For these Parents match their Children without the least Regard to mutual Affection hence splendid Misery glares in so many Places while calm Content flies their mercenary DwellingsWould you persuade here lies the most powerful EloquenceWould you prove the  Steadiness of a professing Patriot here is the Touchstone of intrinsic WorthWould you smooth the Wrinkles of Age or proportion and harmonize Deformity here is the necromantic Beautifier that can work such Miracles and that too amongst Animals which boast themselves of Rationality and yet are so wrapp'd up in Infatuation that while they most cautiously avoid whatever might be hurtful to the Body devour with insatiable and voratious Appetites this more dangerous Poison of the MindOh Reason where is thy Power Mount mount for Shame thy Throne nor longer abdicate thy JudgmentSeat lest usurping Passions create universal and incurable Confusion  How how should we rejoice my Brethren that free from the fatal Influence of this Bane to social Happiness no Blood stains our Fields no Fears shake our Peace that Religion is Gratitude not  Interest that Inclination moderated by Prudence joins every Couple here that Sons when arrived to Discretion enjoy equal Advantages with their Fathers whom therefore they never wish to bury that such Failings as we have amongst us cannot either be hid or rendered less shameful by such Tinsel Covering that here no Tongue will move no Virgin yield her Honour for mercenary Bribes Is not this my Friends a copious Field for Exultation A beautiful and solid Basis for just Selfesteem and Congratulation Let Avarice glote upon its shining Heaps let Glory nod under her bloodstained Plumage let Ambition swell with fading Honours while we oh NOIBLANS wish no greater Happiness than an uninterrupted Possession of our virtuous Mediocrity which we do and ever must esteem an inexhaustible Source of real and invariable Felicity  This Oration pronounced with great Sensibility of Expression harmonious Cadence of Voice and much Grace of Action gained universal Applause from the Crowd Nor could it fail for tho' delivered to them in a Language which I did not understand yet the Manner of it struck  my  Attention deeply Being ended we again moved on and in a few Minutes entered the City Gate  CHAP III  Is conducted to the REQUECEX The NOIBLAN Laws their Chief Magistrate the Manner of his Election and his executive Power described their Marriages the Management and Education of their Youth c  HAVING entered the City we were met by a considerable Number of Persons who joined our Procession which moved onwards to a spacious Square  herein stood a very large Building of or  icular Form into which I was conducted My HOST was the only one who entered  e GREAT Hall with me when desiring  e to recline myself on a Couch while he  ok Place on another he proceeded  us I doubt not SON of EARTH but  any Circumstances you will meet with  this ARESAL or CITY of NODNOL the  APITAL of NOIBLA will appear pecu  rly strange perhaps inconsistent but I  ll endeavour to explain and reconcile  e most material as they occur  This Building we are now in is call'd  e REQUECEX or HOUSE of JUSTICE  ere Law is dispensed and all Matters  Debate which may arise in this City  the District under its Jurisdiction are  cided but that you may better under  nd this Part of the political Constitu  n I must sketch out a general View of  e whole  Know then that this Island of NOIBL  is divided into one hundred SEITNUOC  or Districts each under a City and ea  City under the Guidance of one Mag  +strate called the NAMREDAL who sits o  day every TOIRTA or Week for adju  +ing such Complaints as may come befo  him His Direction is the Body of Law  drawn up in a plain concise Stile wit  out the Intricacy and Incumbrance  multiplied Clauses which serve only  explain away the Sense and diminish t  Force of the original Design If at a  Time he should be in Doubt he  Power to summon a Council of Citize  not exceeding twenty in Number to  +sist him with their Opinions and from Decree founded on such Precaution the  is no Appeal but in Case the NAMRED  gives Judgment of himself to the D  satisfaction of any Party that Party m  claim a fresh Trial and then Arbitrat  are fixed on in the following Manne  The Appellant chuses ten Citizens and the Judge as many these vote six three on each Side to determine the Cause if they reverse the former Decree and impute it to a mere Error in Judgement the NAMREDAL is displaced as incapable but if they impute it to Partiality he is then deprived of all his Rights as a CITIZEN and banished to the dreary Mountains of NEROMA This Check upon Magisterial Authority does not  bridge the Power tho' it prevents Op  ression for the Magistrate is not obliged  o give his Opinion singly but may shel  er himself under the Advice of a Coun  il if he is in Doubt  Once every RAYAMON or Year all the NAMREDALS of the ISLAND meet in this REQUECEX and consider the general  tate of the Inhabitants whatever De  ects appear are regulated by them after  hich six CITIZENS from each District  enter into a minute Inquiry of every NAMREDAL'S Administration during his Year and as they determine give him an honorary Certificate or render him incapable of that Dignity ever after which indeed is the only Office of Preeminence thro' the ISLAND all other CITIZENS being upon an equal Footing Nor is the Post of NAMREDAL in any Shape lucrative Honour and Respect being the only Reward of his Labourhe hears without Pension and before him each Individual pleads his own Cause without Passion or Malice his Judgments are pu  in Force if any Opposition should b  made which seldom happens by any Ci+tizen he fixes on who thinks himself ho+noured not lessened by giving Efficacy to Law Hence you see his Court is no  scandalized by such bloodsucking Vul+tures as those in your World who un+der the Appellation of Officers of Justice  commit the most violent Depredation  and unheardof Cruelties upon those unhappy Delinquents who are committed to their merciless Talons  Just when my sage Instructor had gone thus far I was alarmed with the tolling of a very large Bell which he told me was the ELKNITAN or BELL of NOON and then desired me to look into the Square on every Side where I perceived a considerable Number of young Persons setting out a Kind of Tables Expressing a Curiosity to know what could be the Meaning of this Preparation he told me that the City of NODNOL was divided into twelve SENIRATS or Wards in each of which was a RUVENAL or Square wherein all the Inhabitants took their SELBATAZA or Noontide Meal together without Precedence or Distinction This continues he creates a general Intercourse as they alternately go from one SENIRAT to the other and as each  Person contributes proportionably to the general Stock constitutional Equality and a Sufficiency are thus daily renewed and supported  By this Time again looking into the RUVENAL I saw a prodigious Number of Persons Men on one Side and Women on the other set down to a pleasing Variety of Fruits and Herbage disposed with much Taste and Neatness behind stood Boys and Girls all cloathed in Green a Colour which the Youth wear till they are married with small Vessels of Liquid and some other Materials which I could not distinguish these he told me were the Children of those who sat at the Tables who from the Age of twelve to twenty act as public Servitors not only to create Respect for their Parents but for all those of superior Years  Here I inquired if all present were married what became of those who were  single to which he answered That Persons in a State of Celibacy were not allowed the Honour of sitting in the RUVENAL but remained in their own Habitations as do also those married Couples who are not blessed with any Children  You observe says he no superfluous Luxury in that Repast no Food for Sickness every third Day FleshMeat is allowed but in a small limited Quantity nor are there any high Sauces to flatter palled Appetites all plain nutritious Aliment hence among NOIBLANS no Fevers send the Blood boiling thro' their Veins no Palsies shake their Nerves no Rheumatisms cramp their Bones but free from Disorder by the gradual and inevitable Decays of Age alone they drop into the Grave spontaneously as it were like mellow Fruit without Fear and without Pain Nor is this Regularity this healthful Simplicity all stated Times  of going to Bed and rising which are signified by Toll of Bell thro' the ISLAND largely contribute to these salutary Effects  How different this from the Practice in your World where Nature's Profusions are exhausted to pamper Luxury under the fallacious Title of  Taste  where every Season every Climate every Stream and every Ocean is ransacked for the endless Cravings of restless Mortals where one Half rest by Day the other by Night where Multitudes scarce ever see that glorious Luminary the Sun but destroy their Time and Constitutions by the Light of artificial Glimmerings fit only to delude Moths and Birds of Night  Exercise and Labour also contribute much to preserve and invigorate the NOIBLANS no Person is exempt from either  and the Master of every Family is oblige  to give in a weekly Account how the several Members of it have been employed if not to the greatest public Advantage he is censured as having failed in his Duty and an additional Task is allotted for the ensuing Week nor can a fallacious Account be rendered as all Transactions here are so open that the least Misrepresentation must be detected than which nothing can be more shameful  To all this continues he I doubt not you would say that there is pretty Speculation something well imagined in such a Plan of Policy but then how can it be reduced to Practice without more forcible nay more terrifying Restrictions than any yet mentioned  The Reply to this plausible Objection which I have stated in order to your further Satisfaction and Information is obvious concise clear and conclusive our  Method of treating Children here is so different from that in your World that the Passions tho' the same in Nature are so corrected as to become Sparks to animate Virtue not Flames to destroy it  To effect this most desirable Purpose every Child a few Days after its Birth is taken from the Mother and given to the Care of some other Woman who may by corrective constitutional Qualifications alter the Child's natural Defects if he is born of a Mother cold and phlegmatic in her Disposition he is put to one of a sanguine Habit and thus the Contrast is observed in other Cases so that a due Temparament is formed from the earliest  The next Point of Care is not to indulge any perverse Humours but from the Moment an Infant is capable of Distinction to check by Means proportioned  to its Feelings every irregular superfluous Craving hence that Untowardness of Temper so common amongst Youth is timely suppressed hence are they relieved from the innumerable Cares the endless selfcreated Wants which misapplied Indulgence gives Birth toHow grosly then are they mistaken who call it Cruelty to curb tender Years when nothing is more certain than that one Desire granted creates another till the unhappy Favourite grows thoroughly miserable either by having no more to ask or by wishing for somewhat beyond his Reach From this Error in Parents or Guardians arises the disagreeable Necessity of corporal Punishment which is so oddly administered by some that thro' Passion not Judgment they correct and thro' foolish Tenderness not prudential Regard the very next Moment they caress and sooth the Child into a Forgetfulness of its own Fault and their Corrrection  The Absurdity of such Conduct needs no Comment be it enough then to remark that to those who are used to obey a Word a Word will serve and how easy how natural must it be for them whose Appetites are kept within Bounds even without the Assistance of Reason to temper their Passions when they have not only that safe Guide but Experience also to assist them  At stated Times Youth are sent to the SNOISSAPANS or PUBLIC SCHOOLS which like all other Employments are filled up without Reward except in Exemption from other Offices and Avocations which is a Privilege every Profession also enjoys so that each Person knows the Sphere he is to move in and is solely answerable for his Conduct in it  At these SNOISSAPANS the NOICTOCS or Masters instruct their Pupils in the Principles of Morality the Tenets of  Religion social Duties and the Laws of the ISLAND By the three first Branches each Individual learns how to conduct himself in a private and social and by the last in a political Capacity from this Method he becomes his own Divine his own Lawyer his own Magistrate Having no Commerce with any other Country or amongst ourselves the Arts of Trade and consequently Fraud are unknown with us as to what are called in your World polite Accomplishments they are looked upon to be useless or rather pernicious Superfluities since they not only engross much Time but also afford great Occasion to Vanity  Our Females are also sent to public Seminaries and early taught to know and practise those Branches of Employment which suit their tender Sex they are carefully informed of the several Duties which will be expected from them  when they enter the Marriage State they are instructed to despise Spirit without Conduct Wit without Prudence and Beauty without Virtue they are also taught to believe that Complaisance Affection and Industry are essential to her that would obtain the amiable and exalted Character of a GOOD WIFE they are taught for the PUBLIC GOOD to resign their Children to the Care of others without Reluctance and to treat those which are committed to their Charge with all fit Attention and Tenderness for every Woman here when her Condition answers and Occasion requires is by the Law a Nurse to the Public by which Institution there is a Kind of relative Fondness diffused thro' Society for as it often happens one Woman may nurse for a Dozen or more Families which unites her intimately to them at the same Time that those who do the same endearing Office for her are joined in the  Knot of Friendship Thus a Kind of con  ective Chain unites all the Inhabitants of NOIBLA  Here I thanked my very kind Instruc  or for explaining to me in so concise and  lear a Manner Points of such Novelty  nd good Sense at the same Time requesting that since we had gone thus far  e would inform me how their Marriages were negotiated which Desire he obligingly complied with  No Male says he is married till he is  ull twentyone Years of Age nor Female till she is nineteen from those Pe  iods till the former reaches  thirtysix  nd the latter  thirty  they unite them  elves as proves agreeable but if they  xceed the stated Time in Celibacy they  re banished as unworthy and unprofit  ble Members of Society the Men to  he Mountains of NEROMA and the Women  to the Country of OMYRCHAL or the VALLEY of WEEPING  When a Man looks upon a Female who must be at least five and not more than ten Years under his Age he is when the first Opportunity offers to make his Regard known with plain unadorned Sincerity he is not by any Degree of Flattery ever so distant or delicate to warp her Judgment nor by any Presents to bribe her Inclination If she is free from the Sollicitation of any other she may give him all modest Encouragement or on the contrary if she happens to be engaged in any previous Treaty she is without Reserve to let him know it in which Case he must immediately desist but if she should endeavour to keep him in Suspence and extend her Conversation to others at the same Time when it comes to be known all the Parties she has encouraged have  an equal Right to demand her nor can she be married to any one unless all the rest renounce their Claim  This makes Females cautious how they commence Coquettes and frees disinterested Love from the painful Anxieties of Suspence On the other Side if a Man addresses a Female and afterwards declines to marry her he is banished and any Couple who chance to be convicted of cohabiting before Marriage are not only rendered incapable of ever marrying but are also publickly stigmatized which prevents illdesigning Men from making or weak Women from believing any Promises tending to the Disgrace of one and the Ruin of the other  If a Couple are agreeable to each other and none of the abovementioned Impediments keep them asunder the Man first in Point of Respect mentions it to his  own Parents and then to the Woman's both Sides as mutual consent is all that is required meet and give their Approbation at which Time they reciprocally question each other concerning the Dispositions of their Children conjuring that no Failing of Body or Mind which they have any Knowledge of may be concealed The Declaration being made before the young Couple they are severally asked if any Objection arises from what they have heard if not the Bride's Father appoints the Day of Solemnization upon the Morning of which the Parties repair to the NOTLAM where they are questioned by the Virgins whether they come there actuated by a pure and undefiled Love not thro' the impulse of irregular Passions If a sincere Desire of invariable Constancy if a Design to promote each other's Happiness and a Resolution jointly to cultivate the PUBLIC GOOD be their real Motives  for coming thither which Questions being answered by them in the Affirmative they are placed on their Knees are each sprinkled thrice and vow by the Waters of that HOLY SPRING to keep the cordial Affection they have professed inviolate then the BRIDE presents a transparent Stone cut in Form of a Heart to one of the VIRGINS that she may deliver it to the Bridegroom who returns a counter Part and then laying his Hand upon the BRIDE'S Head says  In Judgement let me rule  she pressing her Hand upon his Left Breast replies  And in Love let me prevail  Here a VIRGIN again sprinkling them says  May Fertility make you honourable and pious Children make you glad Parents  So ends the Ceremony they are then conducted back to the Bridegroom's Father's where a neat moderate Entertainment is provided after which they retire  to a lonely but most pleasant rural Spot called ZAMELA or the PLAIN of MODESTY about ten SILCARS or Miles from the City and there live two REAPANS or Months in Privacy it being deemed inconsistent with just Reserve for a Female to appear publickly in less Time after so serious and important a Change of Condition  As Interest and the Influence of Parents have no Concern in these Marriages it is no Matter of Surprize to find them happy besides as it would be impossible from the Method of living all over NOIBLA to conceal any Coldness or Disagreement either of which renders the Parties highly contemptible to Society if Love by any extraordinary Chance should fail the Fear of Reproach keeps up at least an apparent Cordiality and Decency which prevents the bad Influence of their Example and restrains them from such ir+rational  and unnatural Extremities of  omestic Warfare as you have seen among  any Couples in your World  Struck with the Ease Simplicity and  ropriety of these Customs I could not  elp breaking out into a Kind of extatic  pprobation happy thrice happy NOI  ANS said I on whom Happiness sheds  er kindest Influence how must I feel in  comparative View for my Brothers of  e Terrestrial Globe whose Inclinations  evices and Pursuits are almost at con  ual Variance with Content who live  if they were merely framed to torment  emselves or could find their own Re  se only in disturbing Society born  th perplexing Appetites nursed into  rannical Passions and ripening by con  med Years in Disquiet while Reason  thron'd and enslav'd becomes a base  ocurer to the debauch'd Imagination  d servilely ministers where it should  mmand  Here the great Bell again tolling interrupted my Reflection and a Train of Remarks we should possibly have made on this Subject  CHAP IV  The NAMREDAL's Manner of dining hi  Account of himself and many othe  remarkable Personages translated fro  Earth with their several Destinations i  the LUNAR WORLD  THE NAMREDAL for such I foun  my kind Instructor to be here re+marked that I should shortly see the high+est Mark of Distinction that is ever pai  in NOIBLA for says he the Chief Ma+gistrate to support Dignity and gain In+fluence dines alone in this Hall and  attended by a certain Number of Ci  +zens who pay the Compliment in su  Rotation that each appears in that Sta  ion once a Year  Here being informed that Dinner was  pproaching we retir'd into a neighbour  ng Chamber till the Provision was dis  osed according to Custom which done  e return'd and found a large Table sup  lied with very elegant Simplicity a Number of respectable Persons appeared  Waiting on each Side who all tho'  ersonally and intimately acquainted with  he Chief Magistrate paid as distant and  umble a Respect as if they had been no  ore than hired Servants Not being  sed to a Circumstance of this Kind I  as in some Degree of Confusion at the  xtraordinary Honour offered me of sit  ng at the Table which the NAMREDAL  erceiving he gently rebuked my Diffi  ence and placed me near himself Im  ediately after this a venerable Person  oathed in a long flamecolour'd Garment  whom I found to be an AVOZE  or Priest with very awful and emphati  Deliberation spoke these Words  Fountain of Life great and incomprehe  +sible Dispenser of all Things essential to Hap+piness here and hereafter give to these V  +ands such salutary Effects that they may ch  +rish and invigorate not corrupt and impai  the humble Receivers who gladly praise t  Name and confidently rest every Hope  thee  Perceiving some Dishes prepared in o  Manner and justly imagining they we  designed for me I help'd myself witho  Reserve while the NAMREDAL confin  himself to a Sort of Pulse and Vegetable  mingled somewhat in the Manner of o  Sallads and moistened with an aroma  Liquid called AZONIA During t  Time of Dinner not a Word was uttere  it being held indecent by the NOIBLA  to converse at MealTimes till Thanks are rendered and they have rinsed their Mouths thrice with Water from the NOTLAM  Having given a Sign that our Appetites were satisfied the Table was uncovered with the greatest Regularity and Expedition imaginable when a Desert of various Fruits appeared several of which I tasted and found them to the Palate as much superior in Richness and Flavour as to the Sight they appeared more tempting than any which grow in our sublunary Sphere At the same Time there was placed before us two Chrystal Vessels in Form of wreathed Snakes containing a Fluid of the purest Green I ever saw and fermenting with yellow Sparkles which appeared at first so like the shining of a Serpent's scaly Skin that I was rather startled but seeing the NAMREDAL put his own Mouth to his placing his  Hand to his Breast and bowing respectfully round I did the same at which all in Waiting set their Left Knees on the Ground and leaning their Foreheads on their folded Hands remained so till the NAMREDAL had finished his Draught when instantly a numerous Band of Music gave Voice to their Instruments and play'd about five Minutes during which the AVOZEN presented us with Water and having purified ourselves he with his Right Hand on the NAMREDAL'S Head and his Left upon mine spoke to the following Effect  Most venerable Father of  NODNOL  Delegate of our universal Parent and thou highlyfavoured Terrestrial be thankful for past Blessings and piously industrious to deserve future nor hold such Indulgences in less Estimation and Gratitude because they are daily conferred than if they were admi+nister'd with a more sparing Hand still re+member  that without the constant Support and Direction of an unseen Almighty Arm those nor we this Island the lower Globe nor that great Mass of Fire which cherishes the whole with animating Heat nor the rest of the celestial Orbs nor that immense Firmament thro' which they roll could exist but rushing into Anarchy and elemental War must crumble into nothingRemember also that the external Purification of Limbs is no farther useful than as an emblematical Remembrance of that Purification which your Hearts hourly require  This Ceremony being concluded the AVOZEN and all the attending Citizens retired Being once more by ourselves the NAMREDAL resumed Conversation as follows  Brother of the nether Globe it is now Time I should let you know some Particulars which have at least Novelty to recommend  commend them to your Attention Know then that I was once an Inhabitant of Earth of that Part of it too which you come from and I doubt not but my Name is familiar to you few Persons having made a greater Noise in the Field of Speculation than Bishop WILKINS Roused by the Name I begged Leave if not inconsistent with his present Dignity to embrace him as a near Relation of the LUNATIC Family which Request he most kindly admitted and declared himself doubly happy in finding not only a Countryman in me but a Kinsman also  Tho' to all Appearance I died continued he and was laid in Earth with the usual Solemnity yet the strict unwearied Attention I had paid to the LUNAR WORLD obtained me a Translation to this happy Spot where I have continued ever since in Ease and Respect without a Wish to gratify a Fear to perplex or  any visible Decay How long I may be permitted to remain is just as doubtful as my Existence in the other World was because it is selfevident that all Beings are in a continual State of Rotation till a general Consummation of the vast and impenetrable Scheme of Creation dissolves all perishable Matter and unites the whole in one wide Field of incorruptible Felicity  Here my Curiosity led me to inquire if there were any more earthly Inhabitants or if he alone was thus highly favoured To which he replied that there were great Numbers scatter'd thro' the MOON and that NOIBLA had a considerable Share Most Men says he remarkable for either GOOD or EVIL are translated to some Part of the LUNAR REGIONS as Natives of this World also are in Return occasionally transferred to yours  I shall mention a few of those at present in NODNOL beginning with ALEXANDER and DARIUS who barring some occasional Debates upon their former Quarrels now live in a State of the most perfect Friendship CAESAR and POMPEY also live together here upon much the same Terms CATO too appears amongst us but retains so much of selfish Pride and Stoicism that he has very little Communion with others like them however he is obliged to comply with the Laws of Equality prescribed here where there is no Distinction and only indulges his Pride in private  Those Personages you will allow who sought after unreasonable Preeminence over their FellowCreatures in a State of former Existence are justly excluded from Naturalization and the Dignity of Magistracy in NOIBLA BRUTUS but for his Ingratitude to his warmest Friend  and reputed Father would have been here and well received however as that is deemed the deepest Stain upon the human heart he was excluded from this mild Region and doom'd to the poor and turbulent Country of ERISHNOVER or MOUNTAINS of BLOOD where his gentle humane philosophic Disposition renders him contemptible to others and painful to himself  We have PETER the GREAT of MUSCOVY and the TWELFTH CHARLES of SWEDEN HENRY the EIGHTH Queen ELIZABETH OLIVER CROMWELL and CHARLES the SECOND of ENGLAND LEWIS the FOURTEENTH of FRANCE Cardinal WOLSEY CECIL Lord BURLEIGH and many others which it would be too tedious to mention  Taking Occasion to remark that among the Personages named there was  a great Variety of Characters and desiring to know with what Propriety they could be sent to the same Spot the NAMREDAL satisfied me as follows  The several Persons spoken of says he retain a considerable Share of those Passions which prevailed in them on Earth and according as they were meritorious or culpable are punished or rewarded here not by corporal or external Recompences but by the Pleasures and Pains of the Mind which they experience in a most sensible Degree a Perfection which I take to be in great Measure derived on the one Hand from a comparative View of that unchanging Serenity they see constantly around them yet cannot themselves enjoy or on the other Hand from a conscious Rectitude which makes them Partakers in that Tranquillity  That you may the better understand me and more clearly conceive how generally and impartially Justice is administer'd thro' the Universe I will sketch out the several Characters  ALEXANDER the GREAT and CHARLES the TWELFTH his mad Admirer were as History has informed you rapacious and unbounded in their Ambition an enthusiastic Devotion to the Phantom or Shade of Glory for the Substance can never be gained by lawless Principles had extinguished every Spark of general Humanity in the Breasts of these Royal Plunderers like Pestilence and Famine they waked but to destroy like Earthquakes they shook and swallowed up whole Nations pale Desolation with the red Right Arm of War bore their Standards insatiate Death nodded in grim Smiles upon their Helmets and the devouring Grave yawned wide in all their Councils in vain  the Groans of Widows the Cries of Orphans and the Wreck of Kingdoms struck their Eyes and Ears fortified the one by his Ambition the other by his Cruelty against all humane and tender Sentiments they ran the Race of Destruction till at last they themselves fell Sacrifices to the Violence and Inconsistency of their Natures at which Period they were translated hither with what Fitness you shall judge  As a Thirst of unlimited Power was the ruling Principle of their Lives as Turbulence and the Distresses of Multitudes were their chief Enjoyments they have been sentenced to this Region of Peace wherein retaining their former rapacious Inclinations they are tormented with a constant Desire of Rule and Precedency which they can by no Means obtain and labour under hourly Disappointments of those Plans they are constantly  framing to kindle Discord and create Confusion Besides which ALEXANDER'S Pride has the Mortification of being obliged once each Week to attend upon DARIUS as a menial Servitor however on Account of his generous and delicate Behaviour to the Females of that Monarch's Family this Part of his painful Situation is rendered as easy as possible while the hotbrained CHARLES is doomed to a daily unremitted Attendance upon the Czar PETER which magnanimous Monarch in return of his unwearied Attention and patriot Care to the Improvement of so great and uncultivated an Empire as he reigned over not only enjoys every Privilege of a naturalborn NOIBLAN but since his Arrival here has also been three Times chosen NAMREDAL of this City by general Suffrage and has as often been rewarded for his worthy Exercise of that Office with the most unlimited Approbation  CAESAR as a generous humane Conqueror of an open confident and unsuspicious Nature who being above Treachery himself saw it not in others is held in considerable Esteem but as he was the chief Cause of reducing his Country first under dictatorial and afterwards under imperial Power he is not allowed to rank as a CITIZEN yet his first Steps proceeding rather from the Principle of Selfdefence than of Ambition he is as much indulged as possible while his Antagonist POMPEY whose selfish stubborn Pride was the Cause of subverting that LIBERTY he pretended to support is placed in a much inferior Station entirely dependent upon CAESAR'S Interposition for any Advantage he may desire As to CATO he passes his Time in a Kind of contemptible Solitude branded with the indelible Stigma of having fled like a Coward from his Country when she most needed his Help by  an unjustifiable and ignominious Suicide a Step so mean and culpable that were it not for the Counterbalance of many private Virtues he possessed his Doom would have been much more severe I had almost forgot to tell you that MARC ANTONY is here as fond of Gaiety as ever but labours under the Inconvenience of being obliged to wear a Moppet hung round his Neck as a Mark of his Folly in losing the World for a worthless Woman  HENRY the EIGHTH has brought with him hither all his Spirit of RELIGIOUS REFORMATION it still remains so active and impetuous that he never lets our AVOZENS alone who hear him indeed but as often laugh at the vain Efforts of Innovation to the no small Mortification of his Pride He is also equally amorous without being able to gain the Esteem of any one Female or any Reply to his Addresses except the Recapitulation  of his Behaviour to those Wives whom he treated with so much Cruelty on Earth Besides which that he may be the better known and more despised he is once a Month carried thro' the City at certain Parts whereof the following Notification is set forth  Behold ye  NOIBLANS  a  MONSTER  who while in Power the Father of a generous brave and free People sacrificed every Consideration all nobler Principles to Lust and Pride making even Religion a Party in his abominable Schemes whom neither hallowed Shrines nor the tender and melting Tye of Beauty could restrain from Depredations and Cruelties  His Daughter ELIZABETH for many great and eminent Qualities is allowed Precedence of all Females in NODNOL and would have been once chosen to the Magistracy but the Caprice of having  sacrificed a Favourite to illgrounded Resentment or Jealousy and the Cruelty of having even agreed to the Execution of so amiable a Princess as her Sister of SCOTLAND were universally allowed to be such Blemishes in Character as rendered her unfit for the Dignity she sollicited This Disappointment so rankles in her Breast that she is often heard to sigh deeply and to exclaim  Oh  ESSEX  Oh  MARY  not content with having fix'd a dead and painful Load upon my Heart while in the lower World do you pursue and haunt me here to imbitter the Happiness disturb the Peace and prevent the Honour I might enjoy Must your Blood stain and cloud my Character Must your Groans silence the Voice of Fame  Thus does she often bewail herself So deep so lasting and so powerful are the Stings of Conscience which far outstretching the Wounds of human Weapons prolong their Pains to immortality  OLIVER CROMWELL who next appears in View ever since his Arrival had been endeavouring to obtain the Naturalization and Government of the City full of the same Hypocrisy which led him to the PROTECTORSHIP of ENGLAND Master of the same insinuating Arts of Popularity he had endeavour'd to recommend himself as an implicit strict and zealous Admirer of the Laws both Religious and Political Under this agreeable Semblance many began to look on him with a favourable Eye especially as he had in a most plausible Manner painted himself as the Assertor of LIBERTY and to the Charge of having been a Regicide offered the following Vindication  "I stand before you Oh NOIBLANS to claim the Privileges of a CITIZEN one only Objection you seem to make the Fate of an unhappy Monarch which has been chiefly attributed to me but let me  assert and that with the strictest Truth that CHARLES thro' Obstinacy and the Advice of evil Counsellors fell a Sacrifice to the ungovernable Rage of a Nation highly and justly incensed not as Heaven is my Witness thro' any ambitious Views or sinister Influence of mine Make the Case your own Oh NOIBLANS suppose this ISLAND of the same political Constitution as ENGLAND that you had seen every Right infringed that you had traced Royal Prerogative advancing with gigantic Strides and crushing LIBERTY on every Side would you not have felt Would you not have spoke And finding Remonstances fail would you not have roused Force to vindicate yourselves Does Reason or Law exempt any Man from Examination or secure him in Oppression because Chance makes him Heir to Regal Dignity Would you like passive and defenceless Lambs tamely wait till the ravening Wolf leap'd the Fold  and revelled in your dearest Blood Your happy Frame of Government knows not such Convulsions and may it never know them yet Imagination may awake your Feelings and inform your Judgment If Selfdefence be the first great Law of Nature is it not full as justifiable in a Nation as in an Individual And if so must there not be some Conductors who like Sinews in the human Body may brace and give Strength to the Body Politic In this Capacity it pleased Providence to place me and for many Years much against my natural Disposition I toiled thro' Fatigues and Blood not only encountering the Hazards of War but also the greater and more sure working Danger of numberless Snares laid for my Life both by declared and secret Enemies who not having Ability or Fortune to serve their Country so effectually wished to remove me as the chief Obstacle in the Way of their Pride  "Thro' all this I struggled with unabating Constancy Was it for me singly to stand against Justice and popular Rage nay against my own Conscience too in Favour of CHARLES I know it has been said that his Exile or Imprisonment would have been more eligible than his Death yet to me either Alternative seems cruel or wretched Admitting he was a GOOD MAN but a BAD KING which his most sanguine Friends have allowed was it not more humane and more consistent with his Dignity to remove him from the Turbulence of this Life by momentary Pain than to keep him in a lingering State of Captivity or force him into foreign Climates a poor and miserable Dependent But why it may be said if a GOOD MAN should he be removed at all Nothing can be more obvious than that public and private Virtues are widely different the narrow Sphere of one can never be extended to the wide Expansion of  the other Intention may be good Execution bad and as in the natural Body Reason directs us to part with the dearest Limb however valuable and essential if it threatens Corruption to the whole so in the political one any Member whose Life must inevitably be the Source of Contentions should be cut off This being an indispensible Necessity why should those who effect the Separation be more blamed than a Surgeon is for an Amputation In this Light only my Adherence to the common Cause is to be considered and surely my Administration which was crowned not only with Respect but Terror abroad and national Happiness at home must sufficiently prove that I acted upon such Principles and such only but arduous and precarious is every public Undertaking however disinterested however perilous Envy lies in wait with her invenomed Tooth and Slander with her poisondropping Tongue however  ere where neither the one nor the other  as any Existence I presume this plain  nadorned and unstudied Apology for  he sole Objection that is urged against  e will be sufficient to set your Suffra  es at Liberty which if I did not mean  o deserve I never would sollicit"  Already prepared as they were  s Harangue considerably prejudiced the CITIZENS in his Favour when CHARLES  he SECOND produced a Paper which CROMWELL could not deny to be his HandWriting containing a Scheme for  ringing the ISLAND of NOIBLA under  onarchical Government This raised so  uch Indignation against him that he  as immediately appointed to the servile  ffice of SOLARMAN or COMMON CRY  R which he fills up with infinite Dis  ust  The SECOND CHARLES who in his terrestrial State was remarkable for nothing but Libertinism and a Disregard of Religion is in Return chained as I may say to the painful Office of RANEVER in one of our TEMPLES a Place somewhat similar to that of a VERGER by which he is obliged to attend Devotion at least four Times each Day and is also totally debarred from the Converse of Women for whom he has as great a Passion as formerly when he was King  There is not a Personage in NOIBLA that is in a more painful or ridiculous Situation than LEWIS the FOURTEENTH of FRANCE Ostentation having been his Idol he is reduced to a more obscure and penurious Appearance than any other in NOIBLA under which he labours to maintain all his former Dignity but having no Sycophants near to blazon his Praise he writes miserable Sonnets upon himself  goes about building Things he calls triumphal Arches and Memorials of Vic  ories while CAESAR in PARTICULAR  aughs at his Folly and ALEXANDER fol  owing kicks down the frail Babyhouses of his Pride as fast as he raises them but his heaviest Grievance is that among the numberless Relations he makes of his own and the  French  Greatness not one meets with Credit it being well known that while a King Truth and Faith were two Points he never regarded when Pride and Ambition came into the opposite Scale  WOLSEY that puffedup Mushroom of Fortune in Return of his most exorbitant Insolence is here reduced to the Office of keeping the RUVENAL that is sweeping it every Day and tolling the ELKNITAN before the Citizens dine  BURLEIGH as a faithful Minister who consulted and held an exact Equilibrium between the Dignity of his Royal Mistress and the Liberty of his Countrymen i  naturalized and generally makes one o  the Council that are chosen to assist th  NAMREDAL upon dubious or intricat  Occasions  Thus I have sketched out some of th  many remarkable Personages which a  in this Capital and I am persuaded thei  several Destinations will be thought just  Here I expressed great Pleasure an  Gratitude to the NAMREDAL upon thi  Relation and begged Leave to ask hi  concerning some Persons who occured t  my Recollection he kindly desiring m  to give full Scope to my Curiosity I pro+ceeded and he replied as will be foun  in the following Chapter  CHAP V  Containing Strictures upon the Freedom of AUTHORS and the PRESS a prevailing Sect in Religion considered the Stations of several of the Literati transferred from EARTH to the MOON considered  YOU ask me says the NAMREDAL if none of the Tribe of AUTHORS have gained Admittance hereYesMany For Genius is highly admired  Laudatur et Alget  is not the Case in NOIBLA their Possessions are equal to any CITIZEN'S wherefore not having Poverty to chill nor Perplexity to trammel it Fancy takes a full unbounded Scope and as all write for Praise none for Hire the Quality and not the Quantity of Things written is regarded this prevents the Subject from being soon threadbare and relieves the AUTHOR from the disagreeable Necessity of being like a PostHorse  obliged to drudge to a particular Spot wearied or not  Every Writer being at full Liberty to chuse his Subject and not at all depending upon the Sale of his Book is free from any Obligation of flattering popular Passions he thinks according to his Judgment and honestly writes as he thinks he need not for the Support of Nature scatter infectious Sentiments among the People to the great Prejudice of Morality as was remarkably the Case upon Earth when I was there Answer me Have you not still the Vermin amongst you who produce and worse Vermin who love to feast upon such poisonous Materials  Yes venerable Sir says I we certainly have tho' to the Praise of ENGLAND be it spoken VIRTUE was never more seldom put to the Blush than at present  Our AUTHORS for the most Part want Fancy but their Sentiments are chaste nor do I think this Merit owing to their Integrity so much as to the Public Opinion which happily rejects and severely condemns licentious Productions I mean in the Works of mere Entertainment Indeed as to RELIGION and POLITICS tho' we have less to complain of and more to admire in both than any other Nation yet they are in general treated with great Freedom and sometimes with much Scurrility under the specious Veil of LIBERTY a Word more admired more used and more abused in BRITAIN than in any Part of the Globe besides However as those Convulsions which sometimes take Place in the general Constitution of Nature such as Tempests Earthquakes c strengthen and preserve the whole tho' they create Fear and spread Destruction in particular Spots so watchful and turbulent Spirits  are essential to a Free State to intimidate and detect bad Statesmen who may be crawling with the slow and subtle Steps of Snakelike Policy to unwarrantable Lengths But it may be said those loudtongued Guardians of Freedom are for the most Part designing Men of venal Dispositions no Matter what their Views may be if they set forth seasonable Truthsas to the Inconvenience real Patriots may labour under from groundless and malicious Censure it is an unavoidable Tax upon Office yet of trifling Importance like the Babbling of an unstaunch Hound it may cause the Pack to open but it cannot lead them far upon a false Scent and however strong the Web of Deceit may be wrought Facts are too stubborn to be confined by it Hence the LIBERTY of the PRESS however it may be abused and no human Institution is perfect ought to be most carefully preserved as an unreserved Monitor  to KING STATESMEN and PEOPLE Hence it is that BRITISH MONARCHS if they will but read have an Advantage above all others in regard of popular Grievances and hence is it also that STATESMEN may be corrected in their Blunders or chastised for their Villany Conscious Honesty founded on a Rock  an weather the fiercest Gales of Fac  on and I believe it is an irrefragable Truth that of all the Revolutions which  ave taken Place among civilized Go  ernments there is scarce one to be pro  uced however wantonly it might be  arried on but what was originally found  on Right If an Administration thro'  bstinacy or ill Designs will not hear and  dress the Grievances of a People 'tis  t at all surprizing that the manyhead  Monster once enraged and broken  se should subvert all Order tread up  all Law and mark its ruinous Steps  th Blood  Most Nations Free ones especially should be dealt with like a spirited Horse whom a judicious Rider will keep steady by maintaining an exact Balance in hi  Seat shewing neither Fear nor Cruelty  occasionally giving and checking th  Rein while he prudently and resolute  corrects with the Spur or kindly bla  dishes with his Hand  Your Observations my dear Country+man says the NAMREDAL are perfect just and may the great Barrier of Fre  +dom you have mentioned guard BRITA  to the End of Time may no Pretext  insulted Dignity no Artifice of Pow  ever circumscribe its LibertiesH  do I rejoice to hear that Modesty fin  public Protection this is indeed a g  +rious and essential Limitation  what am I to think of those Atta  sometimes gross ones you say which  made up  Religion Do they not  +pear  of a most irrational pernicious and criminal Nature Does not the Breath of Infidelity go forth like a twoedged Sword to destroy Does it not like pesti  ential Air blast the rich Harvest of fu  ure Hopes Does it not intoxicate with  himerical Reasonings and sophistical Distinctions which like an  Ignis fatuus  in  he Night shoot forth delusive Beams to mislead the unwary Follower  Such Effects sage NAMREDAL says I may undoubtedly be feared and the more as some Persons of eminent Abili  ies have assiduously laboured in these Works of Perversion yet still I comfort myself with Hope that the grand uniform and beautiful Fabric of RELIGION framed by an Almighty Founder can never be endangered by the Blasts of Envy Indeed its external harms may be somewhat obscured its Purity defiled by occasional Filth with which its Enemies  bespatter it but selfexistent it stands above the vain Efforts of Libertinism and like the ERMIN soon frees itself from all the Stains of Pollution  If its Ministers were but half so assiduous to support it as its Enemies are to pull it down its Dignity would easily be maintained Neither Virtue Courage  Wisdom nor any Qualification is known without Trial almost any one may steer a Ship in a Calm but Shoals Rocks and tempestuous Seas prove the able Marine  wherefore the Opposers of RELIGION  seem a Kind of providential Instrument  to aid and improve its Strength Fro  open Attacks it is in very little Danger  but there are unnatural BosomFoes who having got a Place in the TEMPLE by the Flames of Enthusiasm endeavou  to destroy it or thro' the Incongruity of Zeal heap disproportionate Additions upon the Edifice till it becomes deformed  to the Sight and so very tottering that the slightest Breath of rational Inquiry shakes it from the Foundation  Here is the Danger to be feared and lamented yet so very gentle and passive are our PASTORS in general that they suffer Sheepclothed Wolves to enter their Folds and devour their Flocks Nay the Madness or Knavery has reached some of  themselves  several who should be its Guardians have joined this destructive Crew and that not only with Impunity from their Superiors but with the Character of Saints from the People I myself knew a Clergyman in that Part of ENGLAND call'd YORKSHIRE who while he used the common uniform Method of instructing his own Congregation was no more thought of than any neighbouring Gownsman but being once characterized as the Favourer of an enthusiastic and I fear hypocritical Sect  and pursuing their itinerant Method of preaching from Place to Place his Influence so far increased that he could draw People a Dozen or Twenty Miles to hear his  inspired  DoctrineAmazing Infatuation of the giddy Multitude that a Man must lose his Senses or his Honesty to please them that Madness or Hypocrisy should prevail more than truly orthodox Principles or clear and solid Reason  Aye replies the NAMREDAL Is it even so You have then indeed rightly pointed out the real Danger and I am particularly concerned at your Charge of Indolence against so many of the Holy Brotherhood undoubtedly if they would set seriously to work if in their Preaching they would speak as much from the Heart with as much Feeling as those Innovators  seem  to do having sound Docrine fit Morals impartial Reason and establish'd Authority they must soon root  out by  Conviction  such noxious Weeds as produce nothing but false Zeal unintelligible Speculation and rambling Exclamations which extort from Weakness and Ignorance Astonishment Tears and Groans while moral and social Virtues are swallowed up in a Chaos of illregulated Faith and unessential Melancholy the first of which audaciously prompts them to believe themselves Saints and the latter in a great Measure renders them unfit for the reasonable and necessary Pursuit of their worldly Concerns  Is it not wonderful continues he that in the most important as well as the most trifling Concerns of Life Persons in the nether Globe are led by Ostentation That notwithstanding multiplied Instances of pretending PATRIOTS making a snug Retreat under the Shelter of Places Pensions or Titles and being as it were miraculously struck dumb any Man by  the selfsame Steps shall become a popular Favourite and be looked on as the Shield of LIBERTY to ward off the Encroachments of Power Is it not equally astonishing that in RELIGION also tho' they are warned of false Teachers every vociferous Fanatic or sanctified Hypocrite can mislead the Multitude Who like him best who has the greatest Volubility of Tongue whose Speech is the loudest and most impetuous and finds most Fault with established Principles or Customs But what surpasses all Imagination is how the most illiterate Upstarts can gain this Influence Wretches who impudently boast of Ignorance as an Apostolic RecommendationOh HypocrisyOh Novelty How powerful are thy Charms Before them Reason flies an Exile or turning Suicide effects her own Destruction  Here imagining that we had gone far enough upon this Subject which minutely considered would have led us into inextricable Prolixity and that after our utmost Endeavours we could contribute little more than our Wishes to prevent or to amend I returned to my Inquiry concerning AUTHORS and the NAMREDAL proceeded to give me the following Account confining himself for Brevity's Sake as he observed to the most remarkable of the antient Classics and the most distinguished ENGLISH Writers  HOMER says he presides over EPIC POETRY in NODNOL assisted by VIRGIL and MILTON who each contested Superiority with him but upon a fair Debate were obliged to yield he having made it plainly appear that his Plan and most of his Thoughts were original that he had Recourse only to his own Genius and Judgment while his Competitors  had the advantageous Example of his Labours that tho' the MANTUAN was more correct and uniform yet he excelled in Imagery and Characters also that the BRITON'S boasted ANGELS and DEVILS were but an Improvement upon his GODS and GODDESSES drawn from a more copious striking and elevated System of Religion Upon this approved Superiority he was by universal Suffrage allowed Precedence of which however in Compliment to the great Abilities of his two Brothers he makes very little Use Since his Arrival he has produced a Work of infinite Merit call'd the ALEXANDRIAD as a grateful Compliment to that Prince for the great Esteem he shewed while on Earth for his Works and Memory  HORACE whom we have here also and is reckoned a spirited social Companion is appointed to write an ODE to  each new NAMREDAL wherein he must not as is usual in your BIRTHDAY ODES idolize the Magistrate but point out and celebrate those Virtues which may render him worthy of his Dignity  JUVENAL who possesses his former  Cacoethes scribendi  with a Pen dipp'd in Gall since we have no Vices amongst us cannot indulge his Spleen with brandishing the Iron Rod of Satire but as a Punishment for having used it unmercifully in the other World he is obliged to write Panegyrics upon CAESAR who despises them and is doomed to see Pleasantry smile around while he unheeded snarles and mumbles Discontent between his Teeth  BACON LOCKE and NEWTON are vested with the Superintendance of all Philosophical Transactions having succeeded as more general and therefore  more capable to SOCRATES PLATO and SENECA The STAGYRITE pleaded hard for Admittance and his Abilities were complimented with eminent Approbation but the irrational Action of drowning himself counterbalanced all Merit and reduced him to the Necessity of being ASSELAN or Usher to NEWTONSHAFTESBURY also with an Air of much Pertness and Importance offered himself a Candidate but was totally rejected for selfsufficient Peculiarity and a restless Spirit of introducing his own chimerical Notions to the Prejudice of established and wellgrounded Opinions  TACITUS and CLARENDON preside over History My Brother Bishop BURNET would gladly have been their Coadjutor but being convicted of gross Misrepresentations and shameful Falsities in the  History of his own Times  he was peremptorily refused and obliged to  ompound for the Place of Amanuensis  CLARENDON in which

powerful Genius which wa  admitted excluded BEN First his abo+minable Principles bordering upon A+theism  and next his Ingratitude to SHAKESPEAR either of which was sufficient to shut him out so that he is banished to ERISHNOVER where the very Name of Genius being hated he drags on a tedious and despicable Existence As to POPE on Account of his Abilities his filial Affection and the particular Regard HOMER expressed for him he might have been very happy but being charged by poor DENNIS with most unmerciful Cruelty to him and a shameful Envy of his Contemporaries both which Accusations were fully proved he was sentenced to wear a Laurel Wreath mingled with Sprigs of  Nightshade  by which it is not a little blasted and moreover he is almost continually tormented with the Jests and Railery of COLLEY CIBBER BEAU NASH and JOHN RICH late Ma  ager of  CoventGarden  THEATRE the  hree MERRY ANDREWS of NODNOL  ADDISON who was rather admitted as a GOOD MAN than a GREAT POET on Account of his Integrity his Zeal for Morality and Religion while he was on Earth has been naturalized a CITIZEN and enjoys the Post of Secretary to the NAMREDAL and thro' his Intercession tho' not without much Difficulty SWIFT has been admitted his Assistant but on Account of many Objections he enjoys not any NOIBLAN Privileges it being proved upon him that while in the Ministerial Function he paid more Attention to Politics than Divinity that Ambition not Piety was his ruling Principle that he ever took more Delight to censure than commend that he anatomized Characters with as little Remorse as Surgeons do Bodies and that he was guilty of unheardof Cruelty in regard of VANESSA  However as I have remark'd ADDISON'  Interest enforced with the Argumen  that he had done many extensive an  wellappropriated Charities gained him Admission yet his Situation is but indifferent for his Pride ill brooks so subordinate a State and his perverse Nature is mortified at the Tranquillity he sees around him so that he never enjoys any Satisfaction unless he meets some of his Countrymen wearing Badges of their Vice or Folly and then DIOGENESlike he gratifies his malicious Temper with cynical Sneers and biting Sarcasms  Inquiring whether there were any here of other learned or honourable Professions the NAMREDAL told me Very few and the Reason says he may be given without many Words None of the Clergy can be admitted unless it evidently appears that the first great Motive for taking  Orders  was not the lucrative View of a large Income for the Indulgence of an indolent luxurious Life but a serious Resolution to propagate Religion and  Piety to form the Minds correct the Passions and cultivate the Virtues of their Hearers to be indefatigable in visiting and comforting the Sick and as far as Circumstances would admit to be liberal to the Poor to be that their Example might enforce their Doctrine tender Fathers affectionate Husbands kind Pastors sociable Friends peaceful Neighbours and loyal Subjects moderate in their Enjoyments humble in their Deportment and chaste in their Conversation  Under these Restrictions I have known very few above the Degree of Curates reach this Place and to confess the Truth Lawn Sleeves would have excluded me but that several of my Deficiencies were overlooked on Account of my uncommon Attachment to the LUNAR WORLD As to Lawyers they are generally excluded for none are allowed Entrance  unless they can prove that to the best of their Knowledge they have always been upon the Side of Justice and never considered the Fee before their Client PHYSICIANS as such are rejected but extraordinary Qualifications gain them Admittance and all Military Persons as turbulent dangerous Animals incompatible with a Region of Peace are excluded without Exception  Here a confused Noise of several Persons calling out in the Square interrupted our Conversation the Meaning of which will appear in the ensuing Chapter  CHAP VI  The Manner of summoning the NOIBLANS to the TEMPLE Ceremonies preparative to entering the TEMPLE and the Charge given before AdmissionSome Account of the NOIBLAN RELIGION Observations upon Earthly Places of Worship the NAMREDAL's Plan for new modelling the Ecclesiastics in ENGLAND  THOSE Persons you hear says the NAMREDAL are SNERRUNETS to the SALMINA Servitors to the TEMPLE they are now summoning the People to the VESPERS and the Words they Use are NOIGLEVER GENVELA be  grateful to God  Every one obeys this Call and you will immediately have an Opportunity of seeing the NOIBLAN Method of Worship Come go with me the Citizens are in waiting to conduct us  As the Ceremonies must be new and somewhat unintelligible to you your best Method will be to follow the Motions of others do what you see done and in your own Heart after your own Manner and Ideas pay Adoration to the Supreme Director of all Things his Praise and Glory is the ultimate End of all that deserves the Name of Religion Sincerity of Intention is the first and principal Recommendation to Divine Acceptance which it will certainly obtain It is not the Splendor nor the worldly Value of an Offering but the Affection and Duty of him who presents it that can please an Omnipotent Receiver  Passing thro' a considerable Number of attending CITIZENS we went forward to the TEMPLE in our Way I could not but admire the extremely neat Regularity of the Streets and the uniform Compactness of the Houses which will be spoken of  more at large hereafter Coming near the Place of Worship I perceived it to be a most spacious sexagonal Building rising into a magnificent Dome it stood upon a green Eminence of considerable Height over the Sides of which flowed several sportive Rills of Water so transparent that its Sparkles outshone the Lustre of our highestpolish'd Diamonds  The TEMPLE was constructed of a Stone resembling EMERALD united with Cement of a Gold Colour the Dome appeared to be of Chrystal supported by a vast Number of Pillars of the AMETHIST Hue with Capitals and Basis of the purest White the Order of Architecture appeared very different from any I had ever seen and exhibited to View somewhat elegantly singular preserving a Chastness of Grandeur not to be found in the grosser Materials of terrestrial Magnificence  Having entered the AREA of the TEMPLE the NAMREDAL and all who attended him went to several Basons of transparent Saffroncoloured Stone dipped their Heads into Water washed their Hands and dried both with Cloths offered them by Servants of the Church I did so likewise when straight we entered a most beautiful and spacious ISLE where we were no sooner placed than instantaneously such a thick impenetrable Darkness wrapped us round that I could by no Means see those Persons who stood close by At the same Time from above below and every Side the most dismal Sounds undulating thro' the Building struck my astonished Ears and I may add intimidated me not a little On one Side Torment screamed hideously and on another Despair vented her lamentable Groans This lasted between five and ten Minutes when as quick as Thought the inner Part of the TEMPLE  opening such a Flood of Light burst upon us from many Thousands of Chrystal Lamps that my Eyes could hardly bear so powerful a Contrast The doleful Howlings were changed into Melody that might almost be called Celestial This odd and striking Ceremony I found to mean that as all created Beings are imperfect in some Degree by Nature and more by Practice Justice would condemn them to the Seat of Mourning but infinite Mercy satisfied with temporary Punishments for temporary Crimes opens the Gates of Bliss and takes them inThis ECARUOCNE or Ceremony of Remembrance is performed once a Week to impress a deeper Sense of Duty and Devotion to deter the Worshippers from Vice as they wish not to continue in the Gloom of Misery and to urge them to Virtue as they hope for a speedy Admission into the Sunshine of Joy  Three AVOZENS habited in graceful and awful Robes now approached from the inner TEMPLE at which all the Congregation bowed to the Earth the elder of the three supported by the other two spoke as I was informed afterwards in the following Manner  Children of God I charge ye in his holy and tremendous Name and remember that before him you cannot dissemble if any corrupt Thoughts at present taint your Breasts if there be any one among you who is not in the most unlimited and perfect Peace with all his FellowCitizens if there be any Parents who are not tender of their Children any Children who fail in Respect and Duty to their Parents if there be here a tyrannical Husband or abandoned Wife begone presume not to defile this holy Place with your unhallowed Steps but hide your Heads in Darkness veil your Eyes with Tears clothe your Hearts with Mourning and gird your  Loins with Penitence till you become pure in his Sight whose Eye beareth not a Stain This in the Name of our Almighty Sire I command but if you be free from these criminal Pollutions by the same Authority I admit you to present yourselves before him in this sacred Place with joyful Humiliation an Offering fit for Heaven  Having thus spoke he retired and the Congregation followed again prostrating themselves upon entering the inner TEMPLE How pleasing would it be thought I to see such a Number of Persons upon Earth daring to approach their CREATOR upon the same Principles and under the same Restrictions How could our FASHIONMONGERS who go to criticise upon Dress bear such a Test How could the Sons and Daughters of Gallantry who go to Church to worship one another endure such a TrialO uncourtly NOIBLANS who banish Compliments  ogling Smiles and all Politeness out of RELIGION  DIVINE SERVICE now began and continued with striking Solemnity near an Hour the Congregation sometimes prostrated at others kneeling and then standingSitting is not allowed it being observed that if the NAMREDAL has so much Respect paid him as that none presume to sit in his Presence it must be deemed a most unbecoming Instance of Impiety to take that Freedom before HIM who is UNIVERSAL LORD and FATHER of ALL  The SENIOR AVOZEN having concluded with a very pathetic Benediction we departed The SNERRUNETS as we passed thro' the Isle of the TEMPLE calling out  Maginleb Nalsina yurne yelveren phazaz wal SezivedRemember the  Mediator is in your Houses and sees all your Thoughts as well as Actions  From VESPERS we went to the NAMREDAL'S House and being seated in a Kind of Saloon I entered into an Inquiry concerning the Principles of the NOIBLAN RELIGION  The chief Points of it says he are That they believe a single undivided DIVINITY indescribable incomprehensible to whose Appearance they adapt no Form to whose Attributes they prescribe no Bounds They never consider him as an angry vindictive BEING for That according to their Notions would be to suppose him subject to Passions and consequently imperfect They say he bestows from BENEVOLENCE pardons from MERCY and corrects from the same amiable Principles That as by infinite WISDOM he knows all created Beings to  be fallible he will try them according to their Capacities and Opportunities That he will not punish the Failings of real Weakness nor reward untempted Rectitude To design well and to resist Temptation constitutes VIRTUE as to act under Selfconviction and to indulge pernicious Passions is of the Essence of VICE  In this ISLAND it appears a most strange and partial Notion to fix one Place of Abode one Degree of Punishment and that eternal for all Sinners They believe in and worship a NALSINA or MEDIATOR whom they suppose to be formed and appointed by GOD for the Sake of erring Creatures that he is coeval with the Universe for which however they do not fix an Aera taking such a Disquisition to be both unprofitable and presumptuous That he has the Perfections of a DEITY except that he is liable  to the Passions of Grief and Joy the one caused by obstinate Sinners the other by contrite ones The Reason they assign for the Existence and Belief of such a Mediator is that the pure undefiled Essence of DIVINITY being incompatible with the corrupt Breath of Sin this Medium has been formed that the NALSINA may more particularly superintend the Actions of Mortals receive their Petitions and supplicate for them to the Throne of Grace  Once each Day at least every Person is obliged to attend public Worship and no schismatical Notions are allowed to be propagated tho' every Man is at Libery to judge for himself if he decently complies with established Customs nor do they think that any Variation from thei  System if grounded upon pious Principles will injure future Happiness Al  those moreover translated from Earth  who are not naturalized are indulged in pursuing the Modes they practised in their former Existence if it be agreeable to themselves  I observed continued he that the Grandeur of our TEMPLE struck you nor is it surprizing in a Place where every other Building except the HOUSE of JUSTICE bears a simple unadorned humble Equality but the NOIBLANS think it serves to create a greater and more awful Respect to the DIVINITY to whom it is dedicated it is to influence themselves not to gratify their GOD for they are persuaded that Works of Piety are as fragrant and of as much Estimation from the lowly Cottage as the most towering EdificeHow different is this Principle and Practice of the NOIBLANS from what I remember to have observ'd in  England  where most of the Noblemen's Stables are Buildings superior to many of the Churches  This last Remark I could not help acknowledging to be as much adapted to the present as to any preceding Times and expressed my Concern that it should be so when among innumerable other public Extravagancies between Eight and Ten Thousand Pounds yearly besides Matches are given and subscribed for Horses to run one another to Death and to impoverish the Breed of those useful Creatures who for Sake of Speed are reduced to meer Baubles That so just a Complaint should have Place when at a random Guess Two Hundred Thousand Pounds annually are lavish'd in  overgrown  Salaries or Stipends to Churchmen who never officiate while several of those who toil and labour incessantly in the Pastoral Office as well as many of the Places of Worship are pitiable Objects of Poverty  True says he it is a Point of most just and rational Concern as to those Bounties  which only promote the Spirit of Gaming or in plainer Terms the Spirit of picking one another's Pockets they are instead of Praise highly deserving of Censure yet even they considering some Advantages to Trade accruing from the Money that circulates at public Meetings are not so heavy nor unjustifiable a Tax upon Society as the other Evil that was complained of  What the Reason what the Motive may be for making and continuing so many exorbitant Church Livings no Man can tell unless they be designed to make the MINISTERS of RELIGION mercenary Tools of Government Why should any Man by any Evasion whatever be enabled to hold Pluralities Why is not one Living deemed sufficient for one Teacher Why not one PARISH if small served by one MINISTER at One hundred and fifty Pounds a Year Or if large by two  each having so much Why might no  BISHOPS for such Fathers or Inspecto  I think necessary officiate for One tho  +sand and their immediate Assistant  DEANS at Five hundred Why shou  those who ought to be intirely devote  to Spiritual Matters sit among Tempor  Lords and busying themselves about  present State entering into the Caba  and Factions of Policy lose Thoughts  a future Why should so many Prebe  +daries and Dignitaries who are othe  wise well provided for crush Velvet C  +shions in the Stalls of Cathedral Churche  and annually sweep away such monstro  Sums Why should a Man the high  he goes in Church Preferment be th  less assiduous  Surely these Points well deserve to b  considered and loudly call for Reform  +tion'Tis true  the Labourer is worthy  his Hire  but not of Superfluity and ce  +tainly  that Man in common Life would be deemed very weak who gave extraordinary Wages to a Parcel of idle Fellows merely to stand as Lookerson while he halfstarved the industrious Part that carefully and laboriously fulfilled their Duty Besides continues he there is in the Election of a BISHOP something so farcical that were it not a Jest upon Religion it must excite Laughter To enter upon Choice when the Choice is  bsolutely fixed beforehand makes it  ne of HOPSON'S Kind and what we may  eem yet more ridiculous is the Nega  ive three Times pronounced to a Digni  y which the  humble  Creature by himself  nd his Friends has possibly for many Years together been labouring to gain  The NAMREDAL'S Sentiments most  erfectly coinciding with mine I told him  would be a great Service to Religion  nd a distinguished Honour to the Policy  of Government if such Complaints could be redressed and these Affairs settled upon a permanent and equitable Footing  I think replies he after long and serious Consideration that they might and I shall briefly sketch out the Scheme by which so desirable a Purpose might be brought about You will no Doubt  find me fallible in some Points but I hope not in many nor material ones  Observe then first That I would have the KING act merely as Defender of the Church by his Magisterial Authority to protect it from naturalized Foes and by the Force of his Arms to shield it from foreign Attacks by no Means to inter+fere in the Choice of Pastors as his nu+merous Avocations to other Matters can+not afford him Time to examine into th  Characters and Abilities of those he is t  appoint for which Reason he is unde  the Necessity of taking Recommendations from the Tribe of Courtiers who at all Events push on their own Relations and Dependents This would possibly be deemed a Circumscription of Royal Prerogative but nothing sure that tends to promote Religion and Virtue can take from real Dignity it must rather give additional Lustre and verify a Maxim which says  That Limitation often strengthens Power  I would recommend a total Annihila  ion of all Right to Presentations either  BISHOPS CHAPTERS COLLEGES or private Persons This might be called  Attack upon private Propertybut  ask What Property Do some Hun  reds or Thousands a Year enable a Man  o chuse out a proper Guide for his Fel  owCreatures Few People I believe would chuse a blind Friend to fix on the Person of a Wife or the Situation of a  House Why then in the much more material Concern of being wedded to Futurity or in the Choice of an eternal Dwelling should Men blind with Ignorance or Avarice which is too often the Case claim any Right to chuse If they sell their Election to a Living it is a mean and scandalous Insult upon RELIGION and therefore ought to be abolished if they have no lucrative View they may easily give up the Privilege to more competent Judges  To prevent Murmurings as Men are apt to think what they have once enjoyed is their indisputable Right the present Sons of the CHURCH I mean such as have a sufficient Provision should enjoy their several Stipends for Life but as they fell off the proportionate Division I have mentioned should take Place with all convenient Speed among their Successors  The CLERGY of each DIOCESE in Convocation assembled should upon a Vacancy chuse from among themselves the BISHOP or DEAN of the said DIOCESE being first sworn that no previous Application from any Person no partial Regard of Consanguinity or Friendship but the unbiassed Opinion of real Deservings swayed their Choice Indeed as the BISHOP and DEAN would have no Power of increasing their Incomes there would be but little Chance of Partiality  As to all other MINISTERS upon the Death of an Incumbent Application should be made to the COLLEGES for a STUDENT in DIVINITY to fill up the Place who being recommended by them to the BISHOP should be examined by him the DEAN and six other CLERGYMEN and if approved by them  ordained  and instituted This Method of granting no  Orders  till a Vacancy happened  would prevent such Shoals from seeking Shelter and Subsistence in the Gown where too often they find Indigence  The above Scheme which you may ripen in your Thoughts diminish enlarge or reject as you see fit would be productive of several great and desirable Advantages if carried into Execution First it would cut off all Adulation Cringing and mean Dependence from the Ministerial Function Men of Morals and Learning would be the sole Judges of Persons fit for their Brotherhood not the ignorant mercenary Fools of Fortune If the Robes of Divinity then ever entered the Chambers of Great Men it would be with a proper independent Respect they would then as MINISTERS be only Servants of their Heavenly Master having nothing to wish or fear of this World's Circumstances their Thoughts might and would be more devoted to a  future their Tongues might then with honest and unprejudicial Openness tell essential Truths however uncourtly In short being in a Manner selfexistent in Comparison of their present Condition Obedience to National Laws excepted and being totally debarred of all political Reflections and Remarks in their Preaching they would become a much more respectable Part of the Constitution and more properly fulfil the sacred Title of  Ministers of God's Word  As they are now situated 'tis very much to be fear'd that too many are rather Retailers of the Words and Flatterers of the Vanities of Men  Another great Advantage from the Equality proposed would be the saving a great Sum annually from the present CHURCH REVENUES which being applied to the building or rebuilding of CHURCHES would furnish what might be called decent Places of Worship in every  Spot and would also contribute much to ease the Poor's Rates No slight Consideration where such weighty and multitudinous Taxes prevail as in ENGLAND Taxes which tho' framed by a National Council are generally speaking more unequally levied there than in any other known State  CHAP VII  Meets two Females questioned by them concerning the ENGLISH LADIES Remarks upon FASHION DRAMATIC WRITERS the present ones and THEATRES considered  I Know not to what Length of Conversation our Zeal in regard of Churches and Churchmen would have carried us had not a blooming Youth of about Fifteen acquainted us that Supper was ready when the NAMREDAL said Now  you shall see our private Method of Living which is the same in all Houses my Office of Magistrate only confines me to the Fatigue of Ceremony at Dinner at other Times I am in the FamilyWay  Here I was conducted into another Apartment where was set a small Table and a very moderate Repast of Fruits and Vegetables soon after us two Females of very pleasing and respectable Forms came in quite plain but extremely neat in Dress The NAMREDAL presenting me to the first said This is the Great ELIZABETH of ENGLAND I would have paid Obeisance on my Knee but she remarked with most delicate Affability that her present State of Existence happily claimed no such Respect said she was highly pleased at seeing a Countryman and that after Supper she had many Questions to ask Being introduced to the other Female I found she was the  NAMREDAL'S WifeTake Notice that Persons translated from Earth are not like the NOIBLANS limited to a particular Age for Marriage but if naturalized may chuse when and whom as may be most agreeable  Conscious of being unacquainted with the Customs of Salutation I paused for some Time in a State of diffident Confusion which my kind Instructor perceivingBlush not says he at being ignorant of what before now you could not possibly be acquainted with RIDICULE is a bitter Weed that rarely shoots up in NOIBLA we do not like the Malevolent in your World wound Modesty with cruel unseasonable Sneers and Laughter on the contrary we give with Pleasure all possible Information to those who may inadvertently do wrong  How ignorantly inhuman is it to dart the Stings of RIDICULE at a Person for  taking Steps too long or too short turning Toes in instead of out drooping the Head instead of holding it erect or dangling the Arms instead of disposing them according to Art Why should a volatile FRENCHMAN laugh at the more temperate BRITON for Gravity or the BRITON vent his Spleen at a SPANIARD for Formality and at a DUTCHMAN for his wide Breeches Indeed if any one of those Articles made a Man better or worse they would deserve Remark but as every Nation has its Virtues and I believe the same may also be said of every Individual some few Oddities or what seem so should be overlooked or corrected with Tenderness  But continues he I am going too far know that our Method of Salutation between the different Sexes is the Man holds his Hand over the Female's Head without touching and says  May Virtue  and Constancy ever flourish  To which she replies her Right Hand pointing to her Left Breast  With Love and Obedience  This is the whole of Ceremony and only used once each Day let them meet ever so often  Here we sat down to Supper the NAMREDAL having invoked a Blessing During the whole we sat silent as at Dinner and having finished performed the same Ablution We were attended by two Boys and two Girls Children of the NAMREDAL who after Thanks returned removed every Thing with a pleasing Dexterity when my kind Host broke Silence in the following Manner  As we are all acquainted with ENGLISH says he we will converse in that Language I know that were it not for Custom whose arbitrary Power renders every Thing more bearable the Ceremony of  Silence at MealTimes would be deemed as great a Hardship by the Females of NOIBLA as it must be to the Females of the nether World even now Ladies I know your Tongues are itching for Liberty so e'en let them loose  Upon my Word Sir NAMREDAL replies ELIZABETH you shall be called to Account if you are so tart upon our Sex don't you know that Talking is our Privilege here as well as on Earth nay let me tell you if once roused up we can think and act too but you Lordly Creatures called Men would make Cyphers of us that was the Reason I always stood by myself and made some of my Brother MONARCHS know that the Policy and Resolution of a Woman is as much to be feared as those of Men come Sir says she this is no Magistrate in his own House so for all his Gravity we'll be as prattling as we please  With all my Heart replies the NAMREDAL my Gravity can't have more agreeable Relaxation and to prove it I'll make one among you so let us hear what you'll propose for our Entertainment  Here addressing herself to me she said I was so much fatigued with Politics while on Earth that I shan't trouble you with many Questions that Way yet I should be glad to know whether LIBERTY still flourishes as it did while I held the Reins of Government To this replying in the Affirmative and that an equal if not a superior Share of Military Fame attended the BRITISH Arms she seemed particularly pleased and then asked me about her Countrywomen what Virtues and Foibles at present prevailed amongst them  This Interrogatory occasioned some Hesitation Madam says I to speak the Truth will rather appear Severity and I  would not willingly enter into a Misrepresentation by false Softening and misapplied Tenderness I shall sketch out a Picture as like the Originals as my Observation and Fancy will admit in which Light I hope you will candidly receive it  Certainly says she it is not the Cus  om to disguise Truth here in regard to  ither Sex it is told contrary to the old ENGLISH Proverb at all Times and in  ll Places therefore you cannot oblige  s more than to adhere strictly to it for  owever we might wish our Sisters thro'  he Universe to do as they ought yet to  elate the Vices or Follies of any Part  annot possibly give Offence  Thus encouraged I proceeded The  ADIES of ENGLAND Madam as you  ust remember taken in a general View  f natural Qualifications Persons Fea  res and Understandings are excelled  by none and I believe did they no  take extraordinary Pains to raise up A  +pearances against Reputation they migh  justly claim an exalted Share of Virtue  but a strange unaccountable Frenzy  called FASHION so intoxicates the  Brain that almost every Consideratio  is sacrificed to the ridiculous Worship  that Idol which has given such unlimi  +ed Sway that if a Husband Father  Guardian pretends to find Fault and ad+vise he is immediately silenced by th  powerful Word the extraordinary E  +fects of which you will more fully com+prehend by sketching the Outlines of  fine Lady's Life  It has been justly observed that a we  regulated Reserve and Modesty are th  chief Points of Beauty in a Female Ch  +racter but this Opinion FASHION h  totally overthrown and stigmatiz'd the  with the Terms of unbred Sheepishnes  while a shameless Front staring Eyes wandering Limbs and nonsensical Vociferation usurp the Titles of Elegance Ease and Wit these admirable Qualifications are seen to a considerable Degree even in single Females but arise to so eminent a Pitch of Perfection in married ones that it would almost occasion an Observer to believe they only considered Matrimony as a Licence to free them from every rational Restriction as a Passport to carry them thro' the Paths of Li  entiousness to such all Men are alike  ut their Husbands they indeed find Coldness and Reserve enough But these  re general Remarks I must come more within the Bounds of a particular Cha  acter which cannot be better struck out  han by giving you the daily Disposition  f Time  In this Point I know not well where  r how to begin as a fashionable Lady  has no Morning Let it suffice to say she gets up at Noon or after it receives and reads Cards of Compliment during Breakfast takes her Chair or Chariot and tires both the Men and Horses in galloping from Street to Street to pay what they call MORNING Visits then returns and dines in the Evening drinks Tea at Night and plays Cards SupperTime excepted till the next Day is advanced This with some very inconsiderable Variations is the continual Round of Taste and Elegance  I perceiv'd a Face of Astonishment possess ELIZABETH at this Description while the NAMREDAL'S Lady questioned me whether the Husbands pursued the same Course of Living I told her many of them did but took Care not to disgrace themselves or Wives by appearing at the same Places MATRIMONY with them is somewhat like a CountryDance  where tho' you have a set Partner you as often dance up to those of your Neighbours and so change about  Aye says she And pray what domestic Happiness can such Couples enjoy What Cordiality what mutual Satisfaction How can they possibly fulfill the Duty or feel the tender Sensations of Parents None of those Points Madam I replied are of the least Concern among Persons of polite Taste such mean Considerations are referred to the vulgar rusticated Part of Mankind never admitted amongst the more polished Assemblies Besides they are so infatuated with foreign Frippery that scarce any Thing which is not origi  ally devised among our inveterate and  onstant Foes will go down Meat Clothes and Manners are so adulterated  hat I dare say this Lady who once  ayed the  British  Sceptre with such illu  rious Merit were she to return would  scarce be able to discover any one Circumstance that could bring her Countrywomen to Remembrance  No truly returns ELIZABETH not by the Account you give of them there was such a Thing as FASHION in my Reign and it frequently varied which for Sake of Trade and Manufactures should undoubtedly be encouraged in some Measure but I do not recollect that ever it went to such a pernicious Length It contributed to a reasonable Pleasure but not an idolatrous Pride Night and Day took their regular Turns among all Ranks of People nor did any Degree of Quality exempt a Woman from due Attention to domestic Concerns This did not prevent Hours of Relaxation and commendable Amusement but giving an Edge to Appetite rendered them more pleasing at the same Time that Regularity gave Spirit to the Features Vivacity to the  Dispositions and Health to the Constitutions of my Countrywomen Certainly your fashionable Ladies as you stile them have very little of the healthful Bloom in their Countenances and while subject to the Vicissitudes of GAMING they must frequently distort their Features into very frightful Forms I should think to present them with Mirrors during a Run of very bad Luck would deter them from such contemptible and pernicious Practices unless indeed the Spirit of plundering themselves and others happens to be more prevalent than the Consideration of their Beauty  Well observed says the NAMREDAL I have listened to the Remarks on every Side and think them just but surely continues he the Men must be of a widely different Cast else the Nation could never be in such Repute nor crowned with such Military Fame as you have described  I answered that in general they providentially were so for the Defence and Support of LIBERTY but that many of the Nobility in particular and other Nurselings of Fortune aspiring at the Character of FINE GENTLEMEN act upon Principles diametrically opposite  Aye there replies he lies the Partiality and disgraceful Inconvenience of Hereditary Honours by which the most contemptible Wretch if he be born a Lord continues so and claims Precedence of many Thousands better than himself tho' usurping the Post of a JOCKEY with pitiful Ambition he scampers over the Turf or in the Semblance of a GAMESTER rattles the Dice still his Nobility of Blood consecrates as it were such Baseness and gives the Wretch an unmerited and dangerous ImportanceNow Shame upon itDid REASON ever authorize such Principles No certainly  rather Vice in the Garb of Reason knowing her own Deformity has run for Shelther under the Glare of Political Honours which may render her true Shape less perceptible and consequently less frightful If Rank were to be the Result of approved Merit only it would much more justly and universally claim Respect In the present Disposition of Things tho' it serves to awe the Vulgar in the View of sensible Men it does but reflect Scandal upon the unworthy Possessors  Several other Questions were asked alternately by the NAMREDAL his Wife and ELIZABETH but as my Answers were necessarily Descriptions of what the Readers must be sufficiently acquainted with as being intimately known to almost every Individual I shall come to the last Point of Inquiry which was concerning the present State of DRAMATIC Writing and our THEATRES  Here I confessed that we have not at present nor have had for some Years one AUTHOR for the STAGE that in any Shape deserves the Name of POET the TRAGEDIES are such cold elaborate unalarming Pieces of Declamation that no Action can give them Life no Attention pursue them thro' five dull Acts Indeed they boast of strict critical Unities and say that the Flowers of Poetry are designedly rejected as improper for Dialogue yet were it not for such Pieces as abound in those Flowers and frequently break thro' the Trammels of CRITICISM from which the THEATRES draw their chief Support our modern Scribes would not have an Opportunity to crawl thro' nine dull Nights in their Passage to Oblivion Nay I will do them the Justice to say I believe that their strict Attachment to Criticism proceeds from its being better suited to their barren Imaginations which want Force and Activity to get beyond  its insipid Limits In regard of their COMIC Pieces as the Duke of BUCKINGHAM said it was no easy Matter to pen a Whisper we find it now a masterly Point to pen a Blank besides it is made almost a constant Rule for one of the Interlocutors to begin speaking before the other has done which I always considered as a Piece of ill Manners In short there is such Snipsnap such Pauses and Hesitation that if Conversation in private was to take Example from what is exhibited on the STAGE it would be reduced to a most unmeaning indelicate Stammering a Labouring like the Mountain to bring forth a Mouse  What says ELIZABETH such a Depravity in a Country where SHAKESPEAR DRYDEN OTWAY and CONGREVE have left such bright Examples I am asham'd of my native Soil and wish it had deserved  a better Character but pray Sir have the Theatres declined equally  To this I replied That to the best of my Knowledge they had never been more encouraged nor ever were worse supported than at present the Incomes of Performers are immoderate the Merit very confined As to the former why might not One hundred ayear besides the Advantage of a Benefit genteelly reward any Degree of Merit By such a Regulation such Savings might be made as would enable Managers to take more reasonable Prices for so rational and essential an Entertainment as the Drama affords In this I would by no Means lessen the Consequence or Credit of the Stage for which no Person can have a greater Regard but by bringing it into less exceptionable Bounds to guard it from the Envy and too just Complaints which are now levelled against it  In regard of Performance I have always thought that the general Course of Nature only can be a fit Standard of Example every Character in private Life will be an unerring Original to copy for the Stage only as WaterColour Painting which is seen at a Distance and by artificial Light requires stronger Strokes than the Oilsoften'd Tints so Action upon the Stage should enforce and render its Original more strikingBut how extremely different is the present Practice instead of Nature ONE eminent Performer who has certainly astonishing Abilities for his Profession is set up to View and a servile unequal Imitation of him glides thro' the various Degrees In the Play of  Richard  scarce a Man but affects some Peculiarity of the crooked Monarch in  Lear  the whole Court is struck with a Kind of complaisant Debillity or when this same Idol of Imitation with masterly Transition descends into the meaner Scenes of low  COMEDY his Grimaces by a Kind of electrical Concussion warp the Features of Characters widely different so that almost in every Thing you may see his Starts his Pauses his Action his Attitude and his Variations of CountenanceBut ah how changed how misapplied I have often thought this paltry ignorant Compliment to superior Merit like a whole Town's takin Fancy to the Cloaths of a Connoisseur in TASTE who without regarding their own Size taller or shorter bigger or less should make theirs exactly of the same Dimensions In such a Case the Original may be pleasing and pretty while the Copies must be utterly ridiculous  Truly says the NAMREDAL at this Rate your Performances must lose much of the Energy that animates just and original Action for no Qualification relative to human Nature can be more contemptible  or cruel than MIMICRY as it either proceeds from a total Barrenness of Idea or an innate Malevolence which catching at and aggravating Defects provides Food for the insatiate Appetite of RIDICULEI am amazed continues he that so much good Sense as must be possessed by an  English  Audience can digest such gross Food or be contented with the Skeletons of Merit  Nay Sir I replied if good Sense was to prevail the Case must soon take a different Turn but there is a delusive Monster called PREJUDICE which leading Judgment by the Nose decides Scarce one Auditor thinks for himself but catches from his Neighbour and retales to a third nor is this confined to Performance it reaches Authors also which may in some Measure account for that Decline of Genius I have mentioned Scarce any Piece can arrive at a Perusal unless recommended  by some RIGHT HONOURABLE Personage who tho' he can hardly read is from his Title by the Courtesy of  England  a profound Judge of Wit Sentiment and Stile A Sort of Necessity to indulge this usurped Prerogative exculpates the MANAGERS from the Charge of not regarding Merit Whenever a Penny is to be got Nobility and Interest must put forth their monopolizing Claws and draw it all to the Dens of their hungry Dependents who are thus laid a Tax upon the Public and become Idolaters of those illustrious Patrons that purchase the Immortality of DEDICATIONFAME at the Expence of others they cannot keep those more valuable Appendages of Quality MISTRESSES and RUNNINGHORSES so cheap  At this Rate cries ELIZABETH I shall lose all Patience and begin to despise my Country I got out of it in Time  and am happily come to a Region where impartial Judgment is allowed its just Influence no Piece here is valued for the Name of its AUTHOR but only for its intrinsic Merit Even SHAKESPEAR tho' he has never failed yet is as critically examined as one who had never wrote before indeed there is a precautionary Method which renders this Impartiality unavoidable for every new Dramatic Performance is without any Intimation of the AUTHOR'S Name submitted to twelve CENSORS who consider it and give the Sanction of their Approbation or condemn it as unfit According to the Degrees of Merit they are performed and then when ready for Exhibition the AUTHOR confesses himself Such a Court of Critical Inquiry would enlarge the Field of Genius in BRITAIN When you return you may propose it if you chuse in the mean Time if you will accompany the  NAMREDAL this Lady and me to our ESTRALAM you will have an Opportunity of seeing the Rules and Action of our NOIBLAN DRAMA  Well says the NAMREDAL since the Ladies have proposed you so agreeable an Entertainment I request your Company in the Morning to the REQUECEX 'tis the Day for administering Justice and I dare say there will be some Trials worth your hearing I had scarce Time to reply when the great Bell tolling interrupted our Conversation the Ladies wishing me a calm Repose immediately withdrew and the NAMREDAL telling me that was the public Signal for retiring to Rest conducted me in Person to a small agreeable Apartment where Neatness supplied the Place of Elegance there after the most kind and hospitable Expressions he left me to compose my  Thoughts by Slumber or to give them full Scope in the wide Field of Reflection upon what has been hitherto related  When alone a vast Variety of Ideas crowded upon each other in my Imagination first my unaccountable Conveyance to the LUNAR WORLD surprizing and inconceivable in its Nature next that peculiar and kind Reception I had met in it the Novelty of those Ceremonies I had gone thro' the happy Situation the tranquil Equality of the People I had as it were dropp'd among with many other Circumstances which do not now occur Moreover I felt some Degree of Uneasiness that I knew not how I was to return nor when nor if at all but Sleep like a kind Friend came to my Assistance and by its oblivious Influence closing up the Eye of Memory relieved me from those Anxieties which my  new and extraordinary Situation had occasioned  CHAP VIII  Account of the GARDEN BIRDS breakfasts with the NAMREDAL's Lady their Remarks upon BEAUTY LOVE and MARRIAGE goes to the REQUECEX some remarkable Trials  NOtwithstanding the Hurry of Imagination which disturbed me when I retir'd to Bed I enjoyed all Night the Refreshment of composed Sleep Being waked by the tolling of the Bell which I understood to be the general Signal for rising I got up as there was no Window but at the Top of the Room where I lay and that in Form of a Cupola I ascended to it and looking out perceived the Sun to be an Hour high or thereabouts beaming upon the most compact and beautiful Range of small Gardens that I  ever saw wherein an infinite Number of Flowers Herbs Shrubs and Trees were delightfully variegated several Birds about the Size of our common Hens were hovering round their Plumage appeared charming beyond Description their Heads were covered with a shining Down of Golden Hue their Wings exhibited the brightest Scarlet their Necks vied with the Azure of the Firmament and their Bodies shamed the purest Snow These I afterwards understood to be called  Dosen Alopu Garden Birds  and that they are highly reverenced in NOIBLA for two Reasons because first they destroy all the Vermin and Insects that are pernicious to the Fruits of the Earth and next because they are a Kind of natural Physicians for when any NOIBLAN is indisposed as sometimes is the Case slightly he goes into his Garden lies down on his Back when the first of these  Birds that sees him will light directly upon his Breast put its Bill to his Mouth give him three or four Flaps with its Wings then rise and hover round him till he stands up when it leads him to whatever Herb may be salutary for his Ailment and this taken never fails to give immediate Relief  About half an Hour might have passed away in Observation before I heard any Body come when the NAMREDAL'S Son approached with some Water in a Chrystal Vessel which presenting with a fine Cloth he told me that his Mother attended my coming to Breakfast this occasioned me to hasten and having washed I followed the Lad who conducted me whither she was  She received me with most delicate Affability and kindly enquired whether  the Novelty of my Situation had not interfer'd with my Rest I replied That tho' an unavoidable Surprize possessed me yet every Circumstance I saw or heard was so exceedingly agreeable that my Nature had never been more pleasingly or more rationally gratified than since my Arrival in NODNOL This Declaration seemed to give her sensible Satisfaction and she proposed Breakfast in the most hospitable Manner observing at the same Time that they had none of the Materials in NOIBLA which she understood we used for Morning Meals in the lower World yet hoped Novelty would not render them less agreeable  Nay Madam said I my Taste is rather plain and unpolished any Thing will do for me but were I one of the nicest Sort Novelty would be a strong Recommendation Oh how would Persons  of Quality and Fashion in ENGLAND envy me a Breakfast in the MOON How would they pay were there a Communication for Rarities from hence Our EASTINDIA Trade would soon decline as this would be more impracticable and full as useless for tho' we have every Thing in our Island that Nature can reasonably require but  Content  yet are we so industrious to cultivate Trouble and Expence that immense Oceans are ploughed and the most furious Tempests encounter'd to bring home an Herb which being fashionable some Wretches who can hardly purchase Bread must have at any Rate  Here laughing at what she justly call'd such artificial Necessity she poured out a Kind of Azurecolour'd Liquor She told me it was extracted from the  Maltra Enuthe  or  Tree  of  Health  and that the small Cakes eaten with it were made of the  Bark dried powdered and wrought into a Consistence like our Biscuits On Trial I found the Liquid delicious to the Palate and highly balsamic to the Stomach which would have induced me to drink a good deal more than fell to my Share for as I found afterwards the Quantity is limited you take as little as you please but not as much as Appetite calls for The Cakes relished but indifferently however upon the whole I could not complain  Before Breakfast I asked for the NAMREDAL but was informed that being to enter upon the Distribution of JUSTICE he would not be seen till he was going to the REQUECEX that he eat nothing till the Trials were over nor ever suffered himself to be disturbed during the Time of preparatory Devotion It will be near an Hour Sir says his Wife before he appears if a weak Woman's Prattle can make that Space less tedious I will rather  expose my own Deficiencies than suffer you to want Amusement I respectfully thanked her for such unmerited Condescension wherein she so much underrated her own Merits adding that nothing could be more agreeable than her Conversation were I not intimidated by a Fear of discovering a Deficiency on my Side  Mighty well replies she I have often heard that you Men of the LOWER WORLD are vastly given to Flattery which you  always  bestow most plentifully upon Females and  sometimes  upon one another but pray is it not in both Cases of a mean and pernicious Nature It can only serve to make Vanity flourish and predominate over such empty Idols as are fond of this Incense while you who offer it however it may answer particular Purposes must naturally have a poor Opinion of that Feeling you labour so  industriously to create We have luckily no such Artifice no such Parent of Folly among us all Approbation is limited to Minds not Persons to Conduct not Beauty because one is the Merit or Fault of Nature the other merely our own But pray Sir that I may be the better informed of the State of LOVE in your Country let me know whether all are obliged to reinforce their Passion with this intoxicating Ingredient or is it possible to succeed without its Aid  Madam says I to confess the honest Truth such Footing has insinuative Address gained among all Sorts of People that Delusion is much more prevalent than Honesty all cry out against Flattery yet all take it down with great Pleasure but then it must be varied in its Shape according to the Patient it has to work on and tho' the Effect of it upon Women is certainly most extensive  and powerful yet Men of all Denominations are liable to its Influence  As to LOVE it has been well affirm'd by many eminent Authors that it is the noblest Feeling of the human Heart noble when properly fix'd and supported by a delicate Sincerity dangerous when at War with Reason it captivates all our Intellects and leads even our Senses to their own Delusion I would endeavour to describe the fairest Side and shew disinterested Affection in its purest Colours but 'tis in vain to attempt a Description of that which so rarely exists amongst us to find it in any Rank of People is almost a Miracle Marriages indeed are negotiated because Nature and Custom prompt the different Sexes to such Connections but then they are transacted like any other Branch of Trade and Money appears the chief MatchMaker besides as if we had not  been sufficiently sordid in our Way of thinking the LEGISLATURE took Care to frame a legal Bar against mutual Inclinations a Law which serves no one End but to enlarge Church Revenues by exorbitant Fees  A very extraordinary Piece of Policy indeed replies she thank Heaven we have no such LEGISLATORS here I thought you told ELIZABETH last Night you had the same LIBERTY as in her Time now I don't recollect to have heard my Husband who was long after her mention any such Law as you have just spoken of  No Madam says I 'tis of very late Date and as it did not affect me directly I had forgot it And pray returns she how came it ever to be thought of I replied that I never heard nor could imagine how such an Abortion was conceived  some People conjectured it to be the Fruits of a few Great Men's Apprepensions that their Daughters to the Disgrace of Blood might prefer hale sensible vulgar Fellows to emaciated wornout Fools of Quality so in a Rage they determined to make as many young People thro' the Kingdom unhappy as they could and in numberless Instances I believe it has had the desired Effect by occasioning otherwise welldisposed Couples to take imprudent Steps rather than encounter parental Tyranny which shews itself too frequently and the superfluous Forms required by Law  Here she expressed great Surprize that a Nation famed for Wisdom and a Love of Freedom should suffer one of the tenderest Rights of Nature to be infringed or incumbered with unreasonable partial Restrictions then continued to question me about a Kind of Animals she had  heard of call'd PRUDES and COQUETTES when I told her we had Plenty of them the former being a Creature which declines all reasonable Freedoms for a forced Reserve after sheltering the worst Principles under an aukward Semblance of strict Modesty the latter a Kind of wanton Butterfly which flutters and expands its gaudy Wings as much as possible in the Sunshine of FASHION fond of being admired and never more happy than when it can make its Admirers miserable  And are Men says she such arrant Dupes as to be imposed upon by mere Semblances Or is it the extraordinary Beauty of your Women which gains them such an unlimited Influence over Reason  I told her that it was beyond my Power to account for it that Beauty was frequently  to be met with and certainly had much Power but that among the polite World one scarce knew what was Beauty as the Fashions of Shapes and Features were so often altered sometimes oval Faces are the Standard then round ones sometimes broad Waists sometimes narrow so that what is Beauty at one Time is Deformity at another and Nature who is not confined within the narrow Bounds of Rule suffers frequent and undeserved Censure from the ignorant Caprice of prevailing Opinion  Here she burst out into a loud Laugh and repeated the Words FASHIONABLE BEAUTY several Times till the NAMREDAL'S Appearance terminated our ConversationHe told me that if I had a Mind to accept of his Invitation to the REQUECEX he was just going thither and would be glad of my Company I  paid my Compliments to his Lady and went with him directly  We were conducted by fourandtwenty Citizens some of whom carried as among us the  Insignia  of Authority immediately before the Magistrate the chief of which was three Figures in one Piece most admirably cut from a brilliant Stone or Composition the chief Figure was JUSTICE on her Right Hand appeared WISDOM supporting her and on the Left MERCY to whom she kindly extends her Hand kneeling in a supplicative Posture The Characters were set forth with much the same Emblems as we see on Earth  Having reached the Court the NAMREDAL placed me on the Left Hand of his own Seat which I found to be a Mark of Distinction in NOIBLA Two Citizens immediately approached raised  a Canopy over the Magistrate and then closed him in except on the Side where I sat with somewhat like a Silk Curtain I wondered what the Meaning of this could be but was soon relieved from Suspence for he told me that as the Eye was a Parent of Prejudice in almost every Point of View and the best Understanding or soundest Judgment might be warped by it the Custom of NOIBLA was to veil the Magistrate from Sight of those who came to plead before him till his Arbitration was determined it has also says he the good Effect of keeping Attention from being disturbed by surrounding Objects  Just as he had ended this Observation a Citizen with much emphatic Deliberation repeated thrice the following Words  Bineda Oh  NAMREDAL  Twanto Selben TwantastezTemper Oh Father Justice with the Dew of Mercy  This  was the whole Ceremony used in opening the Court which being performed two Females came up and one preferred her Complaint in the following Manner  FATHER of NODNOL I come before you to seek Reparation for an Injury done me by a Woman here present an Injury of the nicest Nature and unprovoked by me in any Shape as it has been my constant Endeavour to live in Harmony with my FellowCitizens yet has she for what Cause I know not given out such prejudicial Reports that the warm Cordiality which has subsisted between my Husband and me ever since we were married is like to abate much at least if it does not I shall be more obliged to  his  Love and Gentleness of Disposition than to  her  Tenderness in talking wherefore I humbly beseech Assistance  from your Authority to restrain her  Is it not astonishing says the NAMREDAL that where Law is so very precise and plain where also it is so generally known that any can be found hardy enough to transgress it Is there any Property we stand possessed of so valuable as Character Any Happiness equal to Peace of Mind or any Weapons so dangerous as busy Tongues How much Censure do they deserve who with Slander taint the one or embitter the other It is a Cruelty of the most affecting Kind unprofitable and ignominious you then who are charged with such uncharitable such licentious Behaviour and to one of your own tender Sex who are as easily blasted as Flowers in the Field say how can you acquit yourself of the Complainant's Accusation or on what  Consideration can you plead a Mitigation of that Punishment which according to Law falls upon the Guilty  Most venerable Sir replies the Defendant in whom dwells impartial Justice to the Charge against me I plead Innocence which I hope to manifest in few Words TRUTH can never be Slander our Laws we all know point out the Duties of our several Stations This Woman my Neighbour who knows and is well able to perform all that can be required of her by an unusual Influence gained over her pliant Husband has for some Time past prevailed on him together with his own Charge to undertake several Concerns which properly fall under her's by which Means gaining more vacant Time than any other Woman can command she has made it her Business to run from House to House promoting Idleness by unprofitable Conversation  and making industrious Women uneasy by sneering at their commendable Application Roused to Resentment by such Behaviour I own I have said that her Husband shows himself weak to be so lavish of Indulgence and that she proves herself highly unworthy of it by such Misapplication This is the Extent of my Crime if such it be and to your Clemency I submit  This Case says the NAMREDAL considered both from the Accusation and Defence pronounces each Party equally guilty you the ACCUSER for shamefully withdrawing from the Duties of a  good Wife  under the Shelter of a Husband's Fondness and you the ACCUSED for being so very forward to publish your Judgment upon an Affair which in no Shape came under your Cognizance By what Authority are you the INSPECTOR of your Neighbours You should be the  Friends the Advisers and not the Censors of each other rather studious to conceal than forward to expose Failings of this Nature but since you are come here fraught with the Spirit of Contention hear your several Sentences  You who have been so ready to alarm Justice by the Clamours of Complaint knowing yourself to be guilty of at least as great a Crime shall for three TOIRTAS lose your Seat in the RUVENAL and attend your Husband there publickly as a Servitor during that Time having the Words  Retho ettibem ElbalAn artful Wife  labelled on your Breast in large Letters and you who have been so alert to proclaim a Neighbour's Failings shall be enjoined strict Silence for the same Space being stigmatized with the Words  Retho slintat ElbalA tatling Wife  Hence therefore and from the Shame you have both incurred learn that social  Agreement is preferable to Contention that to correct our own Failings to mind our own Business and not to interfere with other People's Concerns is the surest Road to Quiet and Prosperity  The Females being removed there appeared two Brothers named EFFILAR and AITROTA the former addressing himself saidAWFUL SIR we are Brothers and Twins not more intimately united by our Births than our Inclinations yet as the Death of our Mother as soon almost as we were born has left the Eldership doubtful and as without fixing this we cannot make any legal Settlement of our Affairs we humbly present ourselves before your Wisdom and supplicate Advice how we may surmount the Difficulty which is still rendered more disagreeable as we both love the same Female but cannot prevail with  her to declare in Favour of either till the Point in Debate is settled  Before I proceed to determine says the NAMREDAL inform me with the most undisguised Truth whether you seek my Judgment from any View of Precedence arising from Eldership and whether to decide in Favour of one will create any Uneasiness in the other Or whether united by the tender and natural Tie of brotherly Love you seek it simply from the Motives you have mentionedThey replied solely from the Motives they had mentioned  Well then continus he you shall have my Opinion but some Space of Consideration will be requisite in so new a Case In the mean Time I must let you know that there is a poor Man who by Accident is rendered incapable of contributing his Share to the common Stock  wherefore he is in Danger of being removed from his Seat in the RUVENAL the thought of which wounds him deeply he has sollicited Help from several but found none if you or either of you can spare Time to assist him it will be an Act of great Benevolence  To this EFFILAR replied VENERABLE FATHER I could wish that I had the Power of assisting him but my Hours are so limited and so fully employed that the kind Wishes of Pity are all I can afford him  Alas replies AITROTA when Affliction wounds Wishes are but a poor and painful Palliative my Hours are limited and engaged also yet if to spare one Half of what is allotted for my particular Use can relieve him I will most gladly Oh Father let him have it  Aye says the NAMREDAL then you have fully convinced me who is the elder 'tis not a few Hours or a few Years that should place one Man before another he who excells in Humanity Benevolence and social Duties deserves the most worthy Precedence That AITROTA do thou enjoy and exert thyself in Pity to thy Brother to enlarge his Heart to soften his Feelings and to create in him an Emulation of thy GoodnessHere the Twins embraced and he whom the NAMREDAL had set aside seemed as well pleased as if the Decision had been on his Part only a conscious Blush glow'd on his Cheek at the just and gentle Rebuke of the Magistrate  As they were on the Point of departing the NAMREDAL said Hold I remember you told me that one Female had engaged the Affection of both but that the Doubt of Eldership prevented her from accepting either This appears  to me a Proof that she is unworthy and that she seeks to gratify Pride more than Love therefore let me advise you to bring her before me and I'll negotiate if possible to your mutual Satisfaction but take Heed not to mention the Determination I have made This Proposal was joyfully accepted and EFFILAR went immediately to bring the Damsel with whom in a few Moments he return'd when the NAMREDAL spoke thus to her  Virtuous Maid here are two Brothers both I understand Suitors of yours they have agreed before me to abide by your free and unbiassed Choice say then whether you will become the Wife of EFFILAR now in Court confirmed the Elder or throw yourself into the Arms of AITROTA the Younger in saying of which he reversed them the Girl without any Hesitation fixed upon EFFILAR when the Magistrate having made her  repeat the Choice three or four Times and declare that Love only swayed her he informed her of the Deceit and that in Reality she had chosen the youngest upon which her Colour went thro' a Variety of Changes and she appeared in the most painful Confusion which the NAMREDAL perceiving for now the Curtain was drawn from before him he cried out with unusual SeverityThou Shame to the NOIBLAN Race thou poor unhappy Slave of Pride unworthy and ignorant of that pure aethereal Flame which disinterested Love beams into the Heart how couldst thou be so blind to thy own Happiness and cruel to that of another as to have thy choice directed by so false a Meteor as Vanity Fly begone worthless as thou art from the Comforts and Pleasures of Society that thou may'st not again have the Opportunity to impose a worthless Heart through Recommendation of a lovely Form I banish thee for five  RAYAMONS to OMYRCHAL at the End of which Time thou may'st return but never to enter the honourable State of Marriage bring forth says he the Garment and Veil of Mourning in which that adventitious Merit on which she prides herself so much may be immediately obscured  At this dreadful Sentence the selfbetray'd Female fainted away the Brothers could not avoid assisting her nor even shedding Tears yet in such Cases Sentence once passed is irrevocable and however they might lament her Fate all allowed it to be just  Mercy deliver us thought I what a deal of Banishment we should have in ENGLAND if such a Law was to take Place whole Swarms of the pretty sprightly fluttering Animals called COQUETTES would be swept away to the  no small Diminution and Prejudice of the  Beau Monde  Harmless Beaus would then be deprived of Subjects for Eloquence Winks Nods Leers Becks Smiles and Ogles the powerful Artillery of artificial Love would be rendered useless and the whole Oeconomy of Intrigue totally annihilated  This Reverie would in all Probability have extended itself to a considerable Length but that I was roused by a confused Noise arising from the Approach of two Disputants one of whom I recollected to be my old Friend BEAU NASH the other in Appearance I knew nothing of The BEAU who still retained his Badge of Office the white Beaver spoke to the NAMREDAL as we shall find in the next Chapter  CHAP IX  Continuation of Trials in the REQUECEX  MAY it please you Sir I was esteemed upon Earth a very considerable Personage 'tis true I am in the MOON at present but no Matter for that I was MASTER of the CEREMONIES at a Place called BATH Indeed they used to stile me KING of it and tho' I am no CITIZEN here I ruled all the CITIZENS there nay scolded Ladies cut Jokes upon Lords directed Balls bespoke Plays and didin short I did what I pleased The Corporation idolized the LongRooms reverenced the CoffeeHouses adored me I had my STATUE set up in the PUMPROOM not a good Likeness but no Matter for thatI was always a great Enemy to Quarrels and therefore never suffer'd a Sword to be drawn in my Territories so not knowing there would  be any Occasion for such Implements in another World I came hither quite unprovided which this grim old ROMAN being acquainted with took the Advantage of superior Strength and Yesterday pulled me by the Nose all round the SALMINA RUVENAL spurring me on every six or eight Yards with a severe Kick which I think very Ungentlemanlike Treatment and I hope you will think so too that he may be corrected for it  The familiar Nothingness of this Speech occasioned a general Smile thro' the Audience and I observed that even the NAMREDAL had some Difficulty to command his Muscles however Reason and the Dignity of his Office checking other Feelings he took Occasion to remark that neither of the Parties being naturalized nor any Law provided in NOIBLA against such violent Proceedings the Justice to be adapted in this Case must lie entirely  upon his Judgment which he would administer with all possible Impartiality For this Purpose he desired the Defendant to offer his Negative or Palliation  The Accused who was no less than the great CATO delivered himself to the following Effect SAGE SON OF JUSTICE AND LAW to be Competitor or Disputant with such a Thing as now stands before me is Punishment equal to the highest Crime yet unworthy and far beneath my Notice as he is I shall enter into an Account of my Conduct which has discovered no Fault but that of too much Mildness  This selfblown Bubble has in tracing himself sufficiently shewn his Emptiness and Insignificance nor will it avail much to set the paltry Portrait in more glaring Colours than that he spent a Life of Fourscore Years in a motley Mixture of Vice  Idleness Foppery and ridiculous Authority the Jest of sensible Men the Companion of Sharpers and Terror of dancing Girls laughed at in Youth and despised in Age  How different from this the Race I run My early Years employed in the Cultivation of my Mind those of ripen'd Manhood worn as I may say in stemming the Torrent of Factionthere view a skipping Child of Follyhere behold a disinterested Son of LIBERTYand shallOh Heavensthis Insect not two Degrees above mere Instinct because we are met in a Region where just Distinctions cease dare to mate himself with CATO unchastised No let it not be said Roused by his biting Taunts I own I did treat him in the Manner he has set forth nor can I think unjustly yet if Fortune which has pursued me even hither with her Frowns continues to torment me I  cannot avoid her Malice and therefore must endure it  This Reply being concluded in which may be discovered as much of Stoical Pride as the other shewed of Foppish Selfsufficiency the NAMREDAL discussed their Case in the following Manner  It is amazing that in this Region of Tranquillity neither Example nor the Fear of Disgrace which is the most poignant Sting of all Punishment can reduce Sublunars from that turbulent Spirit so prevalent amongst themYou NASH continues he who boast of having been so many Years Conductor of public Manners ought to know better than to break untimely Jests upon a Man so much more eminent than you ever could pretend to be notwithstanding those who think themselves Wits on Earth may indulge a supposed Privilege of casting their Darts  indiscriminately round we never can suffer it here unless in Form of legal Punishment since it is repugnant both to Reason and Humanity I shall therefore enjoin you to observe an absolute Silence for one RAYAMON never hereafter on any Pretence to utter a Falsity and to be clothed all the while of your Silence in a coarse Garment the direct Contrast to that you seem so fond ofHere the BEAU groaned deeply and begg'd for his white Hat but even that was denied him which seemed to have still a more sensible Effect while CATO confessed a Kind of cynical Joy at so ridiculous a Distress but as the Enjoyments of ill Nature ever should be it was of very short Continuance for when he thought himself justified in his Antagonist's Sentence the NAMREDAL opened his Eyes and mortified his Pride thus  Think not CATO that the Conviction of him exculpates you though you did receive some slight Offence yet I know not any rational System that unites the several Characters of Complainant Judge and Executioner Besides there is in your Defence somewhat as blameable as in the former Part of your Conduct Your Accuser sets forth his own Character justly without throwing any Sarcasms upon yours he betrayed Pride but then it is of the inoffensive KindOn the contrary you have endeavoured to mount yourself on his poor Ruins you have carefully diminished him and ostentatiously magnified yourself tho' a Man of your Reflection must know that the greatest Merit vanishes before Selfpraise like Chaff before the Wind Besides you have enviously suppressed one most amiable Part of his Character an industrious unlimited Disposition to Charity which must have reached your Ears as well as other  Points relating to himYou boast of Philosophy how comes it that so armed you could not restrain yourself from Blows and suffer his Insignificance to pass unheeded But the Passion of ungovernable Pride which intoxicated you on Earth still visibly prevails tho' you have so often felt its bad Effects in this Case I cannot avoid passing upon you the following Sentence That after NASH has performed his Pennance you shall be obliged to keep him Company for two RAYAMONS when by my Authrity he may talk as much as loud as fast and vent as keen a Ridicule as he pleases being at Liberty once each TOIRTA to claim the Assistance of his Associates CIBBER and RICH  These Names made the Stoic shudder but knowing the Matter was unavoidable he collected what Resolution he could to carry off Appearances and flounced  out of COURT with a Look of ineffable Contempt while CAESAR and POMPEY who had been listening from a Corner to the whole Transaction indulged their Mirth very freely on this Occasion  The next Complaint was a Charge of Ingratitude preferred by one Man against another in which the Plaintiff set forth That he had upon several Occasions assisted the Defendant that he had been industrious to oblige him notwithstanding which continues he forgetting the Feelings every honest Man should have for Favours received he has taken the first Opportunity of shewing himself my Enemy  What says the NAMREDAL is it possible Can there in NOIBLA be such a Wretch INGRATITUDE the very Mention of a Temper so disgraceful to the reasonable Nature provokes our Indignation  Shall Beasts of the Field cast off their Wildness and enter into a grateful kind Intimacy with their Keeper Shall the winged Inhabitants of Air come tamely to the Hand that feeds them and shall Man steel his Heart against all Impressions of Kindness and all Sentiments of GRATITUDE Oh Shame Shame Shame Say thou who art complained against how thou canst wipe off so deep a Stain a Stain which were it possible thou couldst have a thousand other Virtues would sully and depreciate them all  Sage and merciful ADMINISTRATOR of JUSTICE says the Defendant to describe the Anxiety I feel in being even supposed capable of such a Crime requires more forcible Expression than I am possessed of it pains me too that in my Defence I must cast some Censure upon a Man who I acknowledge has often done me Service but his own precipitate  Temper forces the disagreeable Task upon me and Selfdefence requires me to perform it which however I shall do in as gentle and concise a Manner as possible  I have confessed myself indebted for Favours received but how far the Obligation was diminished by my Benefactor's public boasting of his Kindness to me at several different Times and Places I submit Oh NAMREDAL to your impartial Determination Notwithstanding this my Feelings were not lessen'd nor would I have neglected any proper Testimonies of Thankfulness This Complaint of his arises from my having reported some Misconduct I observed in his Family while I acted as one of the ELBIROS weekly Inspectors a Necessity irksome in itself yet at that Time unavoidable by me  Most certainly replies the NAMREDAL are Acts of Friendship to take the Place of Bribes Must Truth and Justice be sacrificed to them Shall the delegated Trust of public Offices be betray'd to private Partialities Besides continues he applying to the Plaintiff thy mean Proclamation of thy Bounty not only diminishes but even annihilates all Obligation hadst thou exerted it merely to serve thy Friend the silent delicate Pleasure of doing it would have sufficed thee but Ostentation was the Principle and being destitute of Virtue it is fit thou shou'dst be destitute of Reward for these Reasons and more particularly for impeaching the Character of thy FellowCitizen I consider thee as a Criminal and shall sentence thee to act as his Servant three REAPANS and once each TOIRTA to make a public Acknowledgement of thy Guilt in the RUVENAL solliciting his Forgiveness  Here the Defendant earnestly implored a Remission of the Sentence remarking that it would be as painful to him as to the condemn'd Person and that he was certain this public Repulse would correct that Impatience of Disposition which led him into ErrorWell says the NAMREDAL I yield to thy humane and generous Sollicitation which for malicious Prosecution returns the gentle Balm of Mercy Depart full of that Satisfaction a generous Heart must fee  from alleviating or averting Distress and thou unworthy Object of this Goodness endeavour by a zealous Reformation to deserve so valuable a Friend  The next Subject of Judicial Consideration which came before the NAMREDAL was an Accusation against a young Man for uttering some Expressions inconsistent with Modesty before a Company of Females As he acknowledged  the Circumstances at large and rested his Cause on the Clemency of the Court nothing more passed but the following Remarks made and Sentence passed by the Magistrate  Hast thou not been taughtOh inconsiderate Youththat MODESTY should be held ever sacred That it is the Shield of Virtue and if once penetrated by the Stings of Vice scarce admits Repair Like Snow it discovers the smallest Speck that chances to light upon it and as that watry Consistence melts away before the Sun so MODESTY vanishes before the Heat of inordinate Passions or even Words expressive of those PassionsWouldst thou preserve Purity in Feeding and yet defile thy Mouth with impure Language Hast thou no more Regard for Society than to vent such pernicious Poison Will it please thee to breathe Infection that may blast the Roses  of Beauty Art thou endowed with Reason to make it an Instrument of Good or Evil If of Good how canst thou employ it to wound the tender and delicate Ear of VIRTUE If of Evil like those venomous and nauseous Animals which are equally dangerous and loathsome thou shouldst be shunn'd and excluded from Society  Thus much I have spoke if Shame be not dead in thee to rouse it What remains for me is to pass the Sentence established by Law for such Offences which is that barefooted with thy Head uncovered and the Words  Retho esol na itsedomA Foe to Modesty  on thy Breast thou art to be publickly led thro' NODNOL six Days successively and afterwards in the same Manner thro' every ARESAL in the whole Island of NOIBLA during which Space thou art disfranchised from all thy Rights and Privileges as a Citizen  After this a grave Man and a young Female made their Appearance and the Man spoke to this Effect I am VENERABLE NAMREDAL Father of this young Woman now brought before you and in that Relation have always exerted my tenderest Care as well from natural Affection as from the Principle of parental Duty I have not only studiously cultivated her Mind which I have found most apt and teachable but I have also upon all Occasions allowed her every prudent Indulgence like a delicate and beauteous Flower she has flourished under my Care yet it grieves me to add that for some Time past she has conducted herself in a Manner very contradictory to my Opinion which I take to arise from an Intimacy she has contracted with a Female lately arrived from the nether World By our Institutions all Women are dressed in the same Kind of  Materials therefore she cannot have Variety of Garments yet has she an infinite Number of what she calls FASHIONS sometimes long Sleeves sometimes short sometimes Wings as if she was going to fly then bare as an unfeather'd Pinion sometimes a Tail sweeping the Ground then so much curtail'd that half her Legs may be seen besides which tho' I have often pointed out agreeable Partners for Marriage she puts me off with saying she cannot give up her Liberty yet that such a one is not handsome enough that another is not witty a third has no Spirits and many other suchlike trifling Evasions notwithstanding which she is never easy but when flaunting with Men This I have often remonstrated against but to no Purpose and of late she has had the Confidence to tell me that Men in Years were no Judges of what was fit for young Women wherefore Oh FATHER  of NODNOL I have brought her hither for your Wisdom and Authority to influence  Aye replies the NAMREDAL have we Disobedience and a Contempt of parental Power creeping in amongst us If so adieu to Order Peace Virtue and social HappinessPray young Madam how have you ventured to depart so far from the Obligations of Nature and the strict Laws of this Island If you have any Apology any Plea make it and I shall attend  The poor Girl covered with extreme Confusion had scarce Power to utter the following broken Sentences that she loved her Father very well and had a great Pleasure in obeying him but that the COUNTESS of her Title is omitted in Respect of some living lately arrived from ENGLAND told her Fathers were  such chuff Fellows who would not willingly allow their Children any Pleasures that no Girl of Spirit should mind them that if she married it would cut of all Admirers that by keeping Company with different Men she would have a better Choice and that making Cloaths in various FASHIONS would set her off to more Advantage  A very hopeful Account truly says the Magistrate and for all this sensible kind Instruction you are indebted to the COUNTESS Upon my Word it would be great Pity and reflect upon us much Disgrace if so publicspirited a Lady who would reform our Manners teach us Elegance for Simplicity and Spirit for Prudence should go unrewarded wherefore Oh ye Citizens you who this Day give Force to Law take Notice that I sentence the said COUNTESS without Hope of Redemption to the VALLEY of  WEEPING there let her expatiate on Taste there let her display fashionable Knowledge there set up the vain Idols of her frantic Brain  As for you young Daughter continued the NAMREDAL who have been led astray thro' Inexperience I shall endeavour to inform you better by remarking upon each Particular of what you have said this the Duty of the Magisterial Office requires and my Duty is enforced by those tender and sympathetic Feelings which urge us to guard or rescue natural Innocence from artificial Guilt  First then as to the Love of your Father I grant it may be affectionate but it cannot be truly filial or perfect without an unlimited Obedience to his Authority and an implicit Compliance with his Precepts which you may be satisfied are both exerted to promote your Welfare  and Happiness I know that he and you view Things in a very different Light as Age and Youth ever do the Vivacity of the latter like an impatient Courser struggles for the full and dangerous Stretch of natural Liberty while the former is making Use of the prudential CheckRein of RestraintConsider Age sees Actions and Circumstances in their true Shape and discerns what Consequences they lead on to while Youth looking through Passiontainted Optics views them colour'd according to their Fancy and their Wish hence therefore the Opinions and Advice of experienced Elders of Parents especially should be allowed all due Influence  Your Choice in Marriage is by the Laws of the Island undoubtedly free and Reason sanctifies those Laws therefore in this Point you have no Compulsion to fear but Freedom is not infringed  by the cordial Advice of those who have your Prosperity at Heart As to the idle Notion of losing Liberty and Admirers by taking a Husband nothing can be more absurd true Liberty does not consist in a licentious Indulgence of Follies and Prostitution of Time but in an uncontrouled voluntary prudent Pursuit of Virtue and domestic Happiness to which the very Name of Admirers is a Bane I mean Admirers of external Charms only for of those who admire the unfading Beauties of the Mind who can gain more than she who distinguishes herself by the eminent and most amiable Title of  A good Wife  She has numberless Opportunities of commanding Praise which the single State affords not in that Character are comprized such invincible Charms as brave the Attacks of Sorrow Pain Sickness and even Death itself the Matrimonial Union collects into a Train of uniform solid and lasting Enjoyment  that Happiness which in Celibacy is diffused variable and imperfect  By associating with a Variety of Gallants you think Power and Choice enlarged it may be so but then it becomes dangerous since nothing can be more prejudicial to the Character of a young Woman nothing more repugnant to Prudence and tho' it be not an absolute Violation of Virtue yet is it a great Blemish in her Reputation for even Appearances of what is wrong should be avoided in the Eye of Reason the Prostitution of the Mind which certainly leads to it is little less offensive than the Prostitution of the Person  As to the Variation of Fashion which is in itself childish it may possibly add somewhat to Attraction of Features nor would there be any great Matter of Offence in it but for the Time it must necessarily  engross and the unprofitable Emulation it must create of outvying each other in Trifles when all our Contest should be to gain an honourable Distinction in the Race of public and private VirtuesDressing to draw Admirers is one of the poorest Baits of Folly Neatness is agreeable to Reason and Nature and equally essential to Maid and Wife more is at best but idle Superfluity  Lock up these Remarks fair Daughter in your Heart think not that being grave they are severe entertain a grateful Remembrance of your Father's kind Attention to your Welfare give Heed to his Advice Obedience to his Commands and on such Conditions I will not only free you from Punishment but even from Censure  Having thus concluded the Father reverently made Obeisance to him and the  Girl returned silent Thanks in Tears of penitent Joy So terminated the Business of the Day when the NAMREDAL descending from his JudgmentSeat conducted me thro' the attending Citizens to the DiningHall when seated he ask+ed me how I liked their Court of Judicature which occasioned me to break out into a rapturous Exclamation Happy supremely happy NOIBLANS among whom Justice appears in her own unadorned modest native Dignity not array'd in the Fool's Coat of Tricks and Equivocation Where the Magistrate is indeed a Parent of the People where unincumber'd Reason takes its free Course without passing through the Windings and inextricable Confusion of Sophistry where Innocence and Guilt are contrasted with judicious Impartiality where Riches Rank or Power never appear to influence but where the calm determined Voice of Equity speaking with the Organs  of Truth not only impresses Conviction but even commands Approbation from those who receive Censure or Punishment  I am much pleased replies the NAMREDAL that you consider this Part of the NOIBLAN Institution in the same Light as I do other Peculiarities which you have met with since your Arrival in these Regions I know cannot so well suit the active Spirit of a SUBLUNAR BeingThere is a general and amiable Tranquillity here but then it is founded upon Principles which entirely restrain progressive Knowledge all here think themselves sufficiently wise sufficiently happy they seek to know no more than they are already acquainted with nor to possess any Thing better than what their Fathers have enjoyed This will appear to you a mental Lethargy and undoubtedly it is such but many  Advantages accrue from such a Mode of thinking which are in themselves so evident that I need not point them out especially as you will next Week have an Opportunity of hearing somewhat more at large upon this Topic when all the NAMREDALS of the Island come to their annual Conference at NODNOL  The MOUNT of OBSERVATION the VALLEY of WEEPING the ESTRALAM NEROMA with other Subjects worthy of Observation will afford you Matter of very agreeable and not unuseful Speculation  Here the BELL of NOON gave Warning for Dinner and interrupted a Conversation which would probably have extended itself to a considerable Length Here also kind Readers after conversing and travelling so far together I hope on friendly Terms you will think it fit that  for a while at least we should part If you are inclined to accompany me any farther in this extraordinary Progress I shall attend your Call and in the mean Time I bid you heartily farewell  The END of the FIRST VOLUME
