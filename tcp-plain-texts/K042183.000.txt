 Passive Obedience  OR THE Christian Doctrine Of Not Resisting the SUPREME POWER Proved and Vindicated upon the PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW of NATURE In a DISCOURSE Deliver'd at the  CollegeChapel  By  GEORGE BERKELEY  M A Fellow of  TrinityCollege    Dublin  Nec vero aut per Senatum aut per Populum solvi  hac lege  possumus  Cicero Fragment de Repub  The Second Edition  LONDON  Printed for H CLEMENTS at the  HalfMoon  in St  Paul  's ChurchYard  To the Reader  THAT an Absolute Passive Obedience ought not to be paid any Civil Power But that Submission to Government shou'd be Measured and Limited by the Public Good of the Society and that therefore Subjects may Lawfully Resist the Supreme Authority in those Cases where the Public Good shall plainly seem to require it Nay that it is their Duty to do so inasmuch as they are all under an indispensable Obligation to promote the Common Interest These and the like Notions which I cannot help thinking Pernicious to Mankind and Repugnant to  Right Reason  having of late Years been Industriously Cultivated and set in the most Advantageous Lights by Men of Parts and Learning it seemed necessary to Arm the Youth of our University against them and take care they go into the World well Principled I do not mean Obstinately Prejudic'd in favour of  a Party but from an early Acquaintance with their Duty and the clear Rational Grounds of it Determin'd to such Practices as may speak them  Good Christians  and  Loyal Subjects  In this View I made three Discourses not many Months since in the  CollegeChapel  which some who heard them thought it might be of Use to make more Public And indeed the false Accounts that are gone abroad concerning them have made it necessary Accordingly I now send them into the World under the Form of one entire Discourse  To Conclude As in Writing these Thoughts it was my Endeavour to Preserve that Cool and Impartial Temper which becomes every sincere Enquirer after Truth so I heartily wish they may be Read with the same Disposition  Romans  Ch    Ver    Whosoever Resisteth the Power Resisteth the Ordinance of God  I IT is not my Design to enquire into the particular Nature of the Government and Constitution of these Kingdoms much less to pretend to determine concerning the Merits of the different Parties now reigning in the State Those Topicks I profess to lie out of my Sphere and they will probably be thought by most Men improper to be Treated of in an Audience almost wholly made up of young Persons set apart from the business and noise of the World for their more convenient instruction in Learning and Piety But surely it is in no respect unsuitable to the circumstances of this place to inculcate and explain every branch of the Law of Nature or those Virtues and Duties which are equally binding in every Kingdom or Society of Men under Heaven and of this kind I take to be that Christian Duty of not Resisting the Supreme Power implied in my Text  Whosoever Resisteth the Power Resisteth the Ordinance of God  In Treating on which Words I shall observe the following Method  II First I shall endeavour to prove That there is an absolute unlimited NonResistance or Passive  Obedience due to the Supreme Civil Power whereever placed in any Nation Secondly I shall enquire into the Grounds and Reasons of the contrary Opinion Thirdly I shall consider the Objections drawn from the pretended consequences of NonResistance to the Supreme Power In handling these Points I intend not to build on the Authority of Holy Scripture but altogether on the Principles of Reason common to all mankind and that because there are some very rational and learned Men who being verily perswaded an absolute passive Subjection to any earthly Power is repugnant to right Reason can never bring themselves to admit such an Interpretation of Holy Scripture however natural and obvious from the words as shall make that a part of Christian Religion which seems to them in it self manifestly absurd and destructive of the Original inherent Rights of humane Nature  III I do not mean to Treat of that submission which Men are either in Duty or Prudence obliged to pay inferior or executive Powers neither shall I consider where or in what Persons the Supreme or Legislative Power is lodged in this or that Government Only thus much I shall take for granted That there is in every Civil Community some where or other placed a Supreme Power of making Laws and enforcing the Observation of them The fulfilling of those Laws either by a punctual performance of what is enjoyned in them or if that be inconsistent with Reason or Conscience by a patient Submission to whatever Penalties the Supreme Power hath annexed to the Neglect or Transgression of them is termed  Loyalty  as on the other hand the making Use of Force and open Violence either to withstand the execution  of the Laws or ward off the Penalties appointed by the Supreme Power is properly Named  Rebellion  Now to make it evident that every degree of Rebellion is Criminal in the Subject I shall in the first place endeavour to prove that Loyalty is a natural or moral Duty and Disloyalty or Rebellion in the most strict and proper Sense ae Vice or Breach of the Law of Nature And Secondly I propose to shew that the Prohibitions of Vice or Negative Precepts of the Law of Nature as Thou shalt not commit Adultery Thou shalt not Forswear thy self Thou shalt not Resist the Supreme Power and the like ought to be taken in a most absolute necessary and immutable Sense Insomuch that the attainment of the greatest Good or deliverance from the greatest Evil that can befal any Man or number of Men in this Life may not justifie the least Violation of them First then I am to shew that Loyalty is a Moral Duty and Disloyalty or Rebellion in the most strict and proper Sense a Vice or breach of the Law of Nature  IV Tho' it be a Point agreed amongst all Wise Men that there are certain Moral Rules or Laws of Nature which carry with them an eternal and indispensable Obligation yet concerning the proper Methods for discovering those Laws and distinguishing them from others dependent on the Humour and Discretion of Men there are various Opinions some direct us to look for them in the Divine Ideas others in the natural Inscriptions on the Mind some derive them from the Authority of Learned Men and the Universal Agreement and Consent of Nations Lastly others hold that they are only to be discovered by the deductions of Reason The three first Methods must be acknowledg'd to labour under great Difficulties and the  last has not that I know been any where distinctly explained or treated of so fully as the importance of the Subject doth deserve I hope therefore it will be Pardon'd if in a Discourse of Passive Obedience in order to lay the Foundation of that Duty the deeper we make some Enquiry into the Origine Nature and Obligation of Moral Duties in general and the  Criterions  whereby they are to be known  V SelfLove being a Principle of all others the most Universal and the most deeply engraven in our Hearts it is natural for us to regard things as they are fitted to augment or impair our own Happiness and accordingly we denominate them  Good  or  Evil  Our Judgment is ever employ'd in distinguishing between these two and it is the whole business of our Lives to endeavour by a proper application of our Faculties to procure the one and avoid the other At our first coming into the World we are entirely guided by the Impressions of Sense sensible Pleasure being the infallible Characteristic of present Good as Pain is of Evil But by degrees as we grow up in our acquaintance with the Nature of Things experience informs us that present Good is afterwards oft attended with a greater Evil and on the other side that present Evil is not less frequently the occasion of procuring to us a greater future Good Besides as the Nobler Faculties of the human Soul begin to display themselves they discover to us Goods far more excellent than those which affect the Senses Hence an alteration is wrought in our Judgments we no longer comply with the first solicitations of Sense but stay to consider the remote consequences of an Action what Good may be hoped or what Evil feared from it according to the wonted Course of  things This obliges us frequently to overlook present momentary Enjoyments when they come in competition with greater and more lasting Goods tho' too far off or of too refin'd a Nature to affect our Senses  VI But as the whole Earth and the entire duration of those perishing Things contained in it is altogether inconsiderable or in the Prophet's expressive Stile  less than nothing  in respect of Eternity who sees not that every reasonable Man ought so to frame his Actions as that they may most effectually contribute to promote his Eternal Interest And since it is a Truth evident by the Light of Nature that there is a Sovereign Omniscient Spirit who alone can make us for ever Happy or for ever Miserable it plainly follows that a Conformity to his Will and not any Prospect of Temporal Advantage is the sole Rule whereby every Man who acts up to the Principles of Reason must Govern and Square his Actions The same Conclusion doth likewise evidently Result from the Relation which God bears to his Creatures God alone is Maker and Preserver of all Things He is therefore with the most undoubted Right the great Legislator of the World and Mankind are by all the Ties of Duty no less than Interest bound to Obey his Laws  VII Hence we should above all things endeavour to trace out the Divine Will or the general design of Providence with regard to Mankind and the Methods most directly tending to the accomplishment of that design and this seems the genuine and proper way for discovering the Laws of Nature For Laws being Rules directive of our Actions to the end intended by the Legislator in  order to attain the Knowledge of God's Laws we ought first to enquire what that end is which he designs should be carried on by human Actions Now as God is a Being of Infinite Goodness it is plain the end he proposes is  Good  But God enjoying in himself all possible Perfection it follows that it is not his own Good but that of his Creatures Again the Moral Actions of Men are entirely terminated within themselves so as to have no influence on the other orders of Intelligences or reasonable Creatures The end therefore to be procured by them can be no other than the good of Men But as nothing in a natural State can entitle one Man more than another to the favour of God except only Moral Goodness which consisting in a Conformity to the Laws of God doth presuppose the being of such Laws and Law ever supposing an end to which it guides our Actions it follows that Antecedent to the end proposed by God no distinction can be conceived between Men that end therefore it self or general design of Providence is not determined or limited by any Respect of Persons It is not therefore the private Good of this or that Man Nation or Age but the general wellbeing of all Men of all Nations of all Ages of the World which God designs should be procured by the concurring Actions of each individual Having thus discover'd the great end to which all Moral Obligations are Subordinate it remains that we enquire what Methods are necessary for the obtaining that End  VIII The wellbeing of Mankind must necessarily be carried on one of these two ways Either first without the injunction of any certain universal Rules of Morality only by obliging every  one upon each particular Occasion to consult the publick Good and always to do that which to him shall seem in the present time and circumstances most to conduce to it Or Secondly by enjoining the Observation of some determinate establish'd Laws which if Universally practis'd have from the Nature of things an Essential fitness to procure the wellbeing of Mankind tho' in their particular Application they are sometimes through untoward accidents and the perverse irregularity of human Wills the occasions of great Sufferings and Misfortunes it may be to very many good Men Against the former of these Methods there lie several strong Objections For brevity I shall mention only two  IX First it will thence follow that the Best Men for want of Judgment and the Wisest for want of knowing all the hidden circumstances and consequences of an Action may very often be at a loss how to behave themselves which they would not be in case they judged of each Action by comparing it with some particular Precept rather than by examining the Good or Evil which in that single instance it tends to procure It being far more easy to Judge with certainty whether such or such an Action be a Transgression of this or that Precept than whether it will be attended with more good or ill Consequences In short to calculate the events of each particular Action is impossible and tho' it were not would yet take up too much time to be of Use in the affairs of Life Secondly if that Method be observ'd it will follow that we can have no sure Standard to which comparing the Actions of another we may pronounce them good or bad Virtues or Vices For since the measure and  rule of every good Man's Actions is supposed to be nothing else but his own private disinterested Opinion of what makes most for the publick Good at that juncture And since this Opinion must unavoidably in different Men from their particular Views and Circumstances be very different It is impossible to know whether any one instance of Parricide or Perjury for example be Criminal The Man may have had his Reasons for it and that which in me would have been a heinous Sin may be in him a Duty Every Man's particular Rule is buried in his own Breast invisible to all but himself who therefore can only tell whether he Observes it or no And since that Rule is fitted to particular Occasions it must ever change as they do Hence it is not only various in different Men but in one and the same Man at different times  X From all which it follows there can be no Harmony or Agreement between the Actions of good Men No apparent Steddiness or Consistency of one Man with himself no adhering to Principles The best Actions may be Condemn'd and the most Villanous meet with Applause In a Word there ensues the most horrible confusion of Vice and Virtue Sin and Duty that can possibly be imagined It follows therefore that the great end to which God requires the concurrence of human Actions must of necessity be carried on by the second Method proposed namely the observation of certain universal determinate Rules or Moral Precepts which in their own Nature have a necessity tendency to promote the Well being of the Sum of Mankind taking in all Nations and Ages from the beginning to the end of the World  XI Hence upon an equal comprehensive Survey of the general Nature the Passions Interests and mutual Respects of Mankind whatsoever practical Proposition doth to right Reason evidently appear to have a necessary connexion with the universal Wellbeing included in it is to be look'd upon as enjoined by the Will of God For he that willeth the end doth will the necessary means conducive to that end but it hath been shewn that God willeth the Universal Wellbeing of Mankind should be promoted by the concurrence of each particular Person therefore every such practical Proposition necessarily tending thereto is to be esteemed a Decree of God and is consequently a Law to Man  XII These Propositions are called  Laws of Nature  because they are universal and do not derive their Obligation from any Civil Sanction but immediately from the Author of Nature himself They are said to be  stamped on the Mind  to be  engraven on the Tables of the Heart  because they are well known to Mankind and suggested and inculcated by Conscience Lastly they are termed  Eternal Rules of Reason  because they necessarily result from the Nature of Things and may be demonstrated by the infallible deductions of Reason  XIII And notwithstanding that these Rules are too often either by the unhappy concurrence of events or more especially by the wickedness of perverse Men who will not Conform to them made accidental causes of Misery to those good Men who do yet this doth not vacate their Obligation they are ever to be esteemed the fixed  unalterable Standards of Moral Good and Evil no private Interest no Love of Friends no Regard to the publick Good should make us depart from them Hence when any doubt arises concerning the Morality of an Action 'tis plain this cannot be determined by computing the publick Good which in that particular Case it is attended with but only by comparing it with the Eternal Law of Reason He who squares his actions by this Rule can never do amiss tho' thereby he should bring himself to Poverty Death or Disgrace No not tho' he should involve his Family his Friends his Country in all those Evils which are accounted the Greatest and most insupportable to human Nature Tenderness and Benevolence of Temper are often motives to the best and greatest Actions but we must not make them the sole Rule of our Actions they are Passions rooted in our nature and like all other Passions must be restrain'd and kept under otherwise they may possibly betray us into as great Enormities as any other unbridled Lust Nay they are more dangerous than other Passions insomuch as they are more plausible and apt to dazzle and corrupt the Mind with the appearance of Goodness and Generosity  XIV For the Illustration of what has been said it will not be amiss if from the Moral we turn our Eyes on the Natural World  Homo ortus est  says  Balbus  in  Cicero  De Natura Deorum  Lib    ad Mundum contemplandum imitandum  And surely it is not possible for free intellectual Agents to propose a nobler Pattern for their imitation than Nature which  is nothing else but a series of free Actions produced by the best and wisest Agent But it is evident that those Actions are not adapted to particular Views but all conformed to certain general Rules which being collected from Observation are by Philosophers termed Laws of Nature And these indeed are excellently suited to promote the general wellbeing of the Creation But what from casual combinations of events and what from the voluntary motions of Animals it often falls out that the natural good not only of private Men but of entire Cities and Nations wou'd be better promoted by a particular Suspension or Contradiction than an exact Observation of those Laws Yet for all that Nature still takes its course nay it is plain that Plagues Famines Inundations Earthquakes with an infinite variety of Pains and Sorrows in a word all kinds of Calamities publick and private do arise from a uniform steddy observation of those general Laws which are once establish'd by the Author of Nature and which he will not change or deviate from upon any of those Accounts how wise or benevolent soever it may be thought by foolish Men to do so As for the Miracles Recorded in Scripture they were always wrought for Confirmation of some Doctrine or Mission from God and not for the sake of the particular natural goods as Health or Life which some Men might have reaped from them From all which it seems sufficiently plain that we cannot be at a loss which way to determine in case we think God's own Methods the properest to obtain his ends and that it is our Duty to Copy after them so far as the frailty of our Nature will permit  XV Thus far in general of the nature and necessity of moral Rules and the  Criterion  or Mark whereby they may be known As for the particulars from the foregoing Discourse the principal of them may without much difficulty be deduced It hath been shewn that the Law of Nature is a System of such Rules or Precepts as that if they be all of them at all times in all places and by all Men observed they will necessarily promote the wellbeing of Mankind so far as it is attainable by human Actions Now let any one who hath the use of Reason take but an impartial Survey of the general frame and circumstances of human Nature and it will appear plainly to him that the constant observation of Truth for instance of Justice and Chastity hath a necessary connexion with their universal wellbeing that therefore they are to be esteemed Virtues or Duties and that  Thou shalt not Forswear thy self    Thou shalt not Commit Adultery    Thou shalt not Steal  are so many unalterable Moral Rules which to violate in the least degree is Vice or Sin I say the agreement of these particular practical Propositions with the Definition or  Criterion  premised doth so clearly result from the nature of Things that it were a needless digression in this place to enlarge upon it And from the same Principle by the very same Reasoning it follows that Loyalty is a moral Virtue and  Thou shalt not Resist the Supreme Power  a Rule or Law of Nature the least breach whereof hath the inherent stain of Moral Turpitude  XVI The Miseries inseparable from a State of Anarchy are easily imagined So insufficient is the Wit or Strength of any single Man either to avert the Evils or procure the Blessings of Life and so  apt are the Wills of different Persons to contradict and thwart each other that it is absolutely necessary several independent Powers be combin'd together under the Direction if I may so speak of one and the same Will I mean the Law of the Society Without this there is no Politeness no Order no Peace among Men but the World is one great heap of Misery and Confusion the Strong as well as the Weak the Wise as well as the Foolish standing on all sides exposed to all those Calamities which Man can be liable to in a State where he has no other Security than the not being possessed of any thing which may raise Envy or Desire in another A State by so much more ineligible than that of Brutes as a reasonable Creature hath a greater reflexion and foresight of Miseries than they From all which it plainly follows that Loyalty or Submission to the Supreme Civil Authority hath if universally practis'd in conjunction with all other Virtues a necessary connexion with the wellbeing of the whole Sum of Mankind and by consequence if the  Criterion  we have laid down be True it is strictly speaking a Moral Duty or branch of Natural Religion And therefore the least degree of Rebellion is with the utmost strictness and propriety a  Sin  Not only in Christians but also in those who haxe the Light of Reason alone for their Guide Nay upon a thorough and impartial View this Submission will I think appear one of the very first and fundamental Laws of Nature inasmuch as it is Civil Government which ordains and marks out the various Relations between Men and regulates Property thereby giving Scope and laying a foundation for the exercise of all other Duties And in Truth whoever considers the Condition of Man will scarce conceive it possible that  the practice of any one Moral Virtue shou'd Obtain in the naked forlorn State of Nature  XVII But since it must be confess'd that in all Cases our Actions come not within the Direction of certain fixed Moral Rules it may possibly be still questioned whether Obedience to the Supreme Power be not one of those exempted Cases and consequently to be regulated by the Prudence and Discretion of every single Person rather than adjusted to the Rule of absolute NonResistance I shall therefore endeavour to make it yet more plain that  Thou shalt not Resist the Supreme Power  is an undoubted Precept of Morality as will appear from the following Considerations First then Submission to Government is a Point  important  enough to be established by a Moral Rule Things of insignificant and trifling Concern are for that very Reason exempted from the Rules of Morality But Government on which so much depend the Peace Order and Wellbeing of Mankind cannot surely be thought of too small Importance to be Secur'd and Guarded by a Moral Rule Government I say which is it self the principal Source under Heaven of those particular Advantages for the procurement and conservation whereof several unquestionable Moral Rules were prescribed to Men  XVIII Secondly Obedience to Government is a Case  Universal  enough to fall under the Direction of a Law of Nature Numberless Rules there may be for regulating Affairs of great Concernment at certain Junctures and to some particular Persons or Societies which notwithstanding are not to be esteemed Moral or Natural Laws but may be either totally abrogated or dispensed with  because the private Ends they were intended to promote respect only some particular Persons as engaged in Relations not founded in the general Nature of Man who on various Occasions and in different Postures of Things may prosecute their own Designs by different Measures as in Humane Prudence shall seem convenient But what relation is there more extensive and universal than that of Subject and Law This is confin'd to no particular Age or Climate but universally obtains at all Times and in all Places wherever Men live in a state exalted above that of Brutes It is therefore evident that the Rule forbidding Resistance to the Law or Supreme Power is not upon pretence of any defect in point of  Universality  to be excluded from the Number of the Laws of Nature  XIX Thirdly There is another Consideration which confirms the Necessity of admitting this Rule for a Moral or Natural Law namely because the Case it regards is of too  Nice  and  Difficult  a Nature to be left to the Judgment and Determination of each private Person Some Cases there are so plain and obvious to judge of that they may safely be trusted to the Prudence of every reasonable Man but in all Instances to determine whether a Civil Law is fitted to promote the Publick Interest or whether Submission or Resistance will prove most advantageous in the Consequence or when it is that the general Good of a Nation may require an Alteration of Government either in its Form or in the Hands which Administer it these are Points too arduous and intricate and which require too great a degree of Parts Leisure and liberal Education as well as Disinterestedness and thorough Knowledge in the particular State of a Kingdom for every Subject to take upon him the Determination  of them From which it follows that upon this account also NonResistance which in the main no body can deny to be a most profitable and wholsome Duty ought not to be limited by the Judgment of private Persons to particular Occasions but esteemed a most Sacred Law of Nature  XX The foregoing Arguments do I think make it manifest that the Precept against Rebellion is on a Level with other Moral Rules Which will yet farther appear from this fourth and last Consideration It cannot be denied that Right Reason doth require some common stated Rule or Measure whereby Subjects ought to shape their Submission to the Supreme Power Since any clashing or disagreement in this Point must unavoidably tend to weaken and dissolve the Society And it is unavoidable that there shou'd be great clashing where it is left to the breast of each Individual to suit his Fancy with a different measure of Obedience But this common stated Measure must be either the general Precept forbidding Resistance or else the publick Good of the whole Nation Which last tho' it is allowed to be in it self something certain and determinate yet forasmuch as Men can regulate their Conduct only by what appears to them whether in Truth it be what it appears or no and since the Prospects Men form to themselves of a Country's publick Good are commonly as various as its Landschapes which meet the Eye in several Situations It clearly follows that to make the publick Good the Rule of Obedience is in effect not to establish any determinate agreed common Measure of Loyalty but to leave every Subject to the Guidance of his own particular mutable Fancy  XXI From all which Arguments and Considerations it is a most evident Conclusion That the Law prohibiting Rebellion is in strict Truth a Law of Nature Universal Reason and Morality But to this it will perhaps be objected by some that whatever may be concluded with regard to Resistance from the tedious Deductions of Reason yet there is I know not what turpitude and deformity in some Actions which at first Blush shews them to be vicious but they not finding themselves struck with such a sensible and immediate Horror at the thought of Rebellion cannot think it on a level with other Crimes against Nature To which I answer that it is True there are certain natural Antipathies implanted in the Soul which are ever the most lasting and insurmountable but as Custom is a second Nature whatever Aversions are from our early Childhood continually infused into the Mind give it so deep a stain as is scarce to be distinguished from natural Complexion And as it doth hence follow that to make all the inward horrors of Soul pass for infallible marks of Sin were the way to establish Error and Superstition in the World So on the other hand to suppose all Actions lawful which are unattended with those starts of Nature wou'd prove of the last dangerous consequence to Virtue and Morality For these pertaining to us as Men we must not be directed in respect of them by any emotions in our Blood and Spirits but by the dictates of sober and impartial Reason And if there be any who find they have a less Abhorrence of Rebellion than of other Villanies all that can be inferred from it is that this part of their Duty was not so much reflected on or so early and frequently inculcated into their Hearts as it ought  to have been Since without question there are other Men who have as thorough an Aversion for that as for any other Crime  Il disoit ordinairement qu'il avoit un aussi grand eloignement pour ce peché la que pour assassiner le mond ou pour voler sur les grands chemins qu'enfin il ny avoit rien qui fut plus contraire a son naturel  He  Mr Pascal  used to say he had as great an Abhorrence of Rebellion as of Murder or Robbing on the Way and that there was nothing more Shocking to his Nature  Vie de Mr Pascal  pag    XXII Again it will probably be objected that Submission to Government differs from moral Duties in that it is founded in a Contract which upon the Violation of its Conditions doth of course become void and in such Case Rebellion is lawful it hath not therefore the Nature of a Sin or Crime which is in it self absolutely unlawful and must be committed on no Pretext whatsoever Now passing over all Enquiry and Dispute concerning the first obscure Rise of Government I observe its being founded on a Contract may be understood in a twofold Sense either first that several independent Persons finding the unsufferable Inconvenience of a State of Anarchy where every one was governed by his own Will consented and agreed together to pay an absolute Submission to the Decrees of some certain Legislative which tho sometimes they may bear hard on the Subject yet must surely prove easier to be governed by than the violent Humours and unsteddy opposite Wills of a multitude of Savages And in case we admit such a Compact to have been the original Foundation of Civil Government it must even on that Supposition be held Sacred and Inviolable  XXIII Or Secondly it is meant that Subjects have contracted with their respective Sovereigns or Legislators to pay not an absolute but conditional and limited Submission to their Laws that is upon Condition and so far forth as the Observation of them shall contribute to the publick Good Reserving still to themselves a Right of Superintending the Laws and Judging whether they are fitted to promote the publick Good or no And in case they or any of them think it needful of Resisting the higher Powers and changing the whole Frame of Government by Force which is a Right that all Mankind whether single Persons or Societies have over those that are deputed by them But in this Sense a Contract cannot be admitted for the Ground and Measure of civil Obedience except one of these two Things be clearly shewn Either First That such a Contract is an express known Part of the Fundamental Constitution of a Nation equally allowed and unquestioned by all as the common Law of the Land Or Secondly If it be not express that it is at least necessarily implied in the very Nature or Notion of Civil Polity which supposes it is a thing manifestly absurd that a Number of Men shou'd be oblig'd to live under an unlimited Subjection to Civil Law rather than continue wild and independent of each other But to me it seems most evident that neither of those Points will ever be proved  XXIV And till they are proved beyond all Contradiction the Doctrine built upon them ought to be rejected with Detestation Since to represent the Higher Powers as Deputies of the People manifestly tends to diminish that Awe and Reverence which all good Men should have for  the Laws and Government of their Countrey And to speak of a conditioned limited Loyalty and I know not what vague and undetermined Contracts is a most effectual Means to loosen the Bands of Civil Society than which nothing can be of more mischievous Consequence to Mankind But after all if there be any Man who either cannot or will not see the Absurdity and perniciousness of those Notions he wou'd I doubt not be convinced with a Witness in case they should once become current and every private Man take it in his Head to believe them true and put them in practice  XXV But there still remains an Objection which hath the Appearance of some Strength against what has been said Namely That whereas Civil Polity is a thing entirely of human Institution it seems contrary to Reason to make Submission to it part of the Law of Nature and not rather of the Civil Law For how can it be imagin'd that Nature shou'd dictate or prescribe a natural Law about a thing which depends on the Arbitrary Humour of Men not only as to its Kind or Form which is very various and mutable but even as to its Existence there being no where to be found a Civil Government set up by Nature In answer to this I observe first that most Moral Precepts do presuppose some voluntary Actions or Pacts of Men and are nevertheless esteemed Laws of Nature Property is assigned the Signification of Words ascertained and Matrimony contracted by the Agreement and Consent of Mankind and for all that it is not doubted whether Theft Falsehood and Adultery be prohibited by the Law of Nature Loyalty therefore tho it should suppose and be the Result of human Institutions may  for all that be of natural Obligation I say Secondly that notwithstanding particular Societies are formed by Men and are not in all Places alike as Things esteemed natural are wont to be yet there is implanted in Mankind a natural Tendency or Disposition to a social Life I call it  natural  because it is universal and because it necessarily results from the Differences which distinguish Man from Beast The peculiar Wants Appetites Faculties and Capacities of Man being exactly calculated and framed for such a State insomuch that without it it is impossible he should live in a Condition in any Degree suitable to his Nature And since the Bond and Cement of Society is a Submission to its Laws it plainly follows that this Duty hath an equal Right with any other to be thought a Law of Nature And surely that Precept which enjoyns Obedience to Civil Laws cannot it self with any Propriety be accounted a Civil Law it must therefore either have no Obligation at all on the Conscience or if it hath it must be derived from the universal Voice of Nature and Reason  XXVI And thus the first Point proposed seems clearly made out Namely That Loyalty is a Virtue or Moral Duty and Disloyalty or Rebellion in the most strict and proper Sense a Vice or Crime against the Law of Nature We are now come to the Second Point which was to shew that the Prohibitions of Vice or negative Precepts of Morality are to be taken in a most absolute necessary and immutable Sense insomuch that the Attainment of the greatest Good or Deliverance from the greatest Evil that can befal any Man or Number of Men in this Life may not justify the least Violation of them But in the first  place I shall explain the Reason of distinguishing between Positive and Negative Precepts the latter only being included in this general Proposition Now the Ground of that Distinction may be resolved into this namely that very often either through the Difficulty or Number of Moral Actions or their Inconsistence with each other it is not possible for one Man to perform several of them at the same time whereas it is plainly consistent and possible that any Man shou'd at the same time abstain from all manner of positive Actions whatsoever Hence it comes to pass that Prohibitions or Negative Precepts must by every one in all Times and Places be all actually observed Whereas those which enjoin the Doing of an Action allow room for Human Prudence and Discretion in the Execution of them it for the most part depending on various accidental Circumstances all which ought to be consider'd and Care taken that Duties of less Moment do not interfere with and hinder the fulfilling of those which are more important And for this Reason if not the Positive Laws themselves at least the Exercise of them admits of Suspension Limitation and Diversity of Degrees As to the Indispensibleness of the Negative Precepts of the Law of Nature I shall in its Proof offer Two Arguments the First from the Nature of the Thing and the Second from the Imitation of God in his Government of the World  XXVII First then from the Nature of the Thing it hath been already shewn that the great End of Morality can never be carried on by leaving each particular Person to promote the Publick Good in such a manner as he shall think most convenient without prescribing certain determinate  universal Rules to be the common Measure of Moral Actions and if we allow the Necessity of these and at the same time think it lawful to transgress them whenever the Publick Good shall seem to require it what is this but in Words indeed to enjoin the Observation of Moral Rules but in effect to leave every one to be guided by his own Judgment than which nothing can be imagined more pernicious and destructive to Mankind as hath been already proved Secondly This same Point may be collected from the Example set us by the Author of Nature who as we have above observed acts according to certain fixed Laws which he will not transgress upon the Account of Accidental Evils arising from them Suppose a Prince on whose Life the Welfare of a Kingdom depends to fall down a Precipice we have no Reason to think that the Universal Law of Gravitation wou'd be suspended in that Case The like may be said of all other Laws of Nature which we do not find to admit of Exceptions on particular Accounts  XXVIII And as without such a Steddiness in Nature we shou'd soon instead of this beautiful Frame see nothing but a disorderly and confused Chaos So if once it become current that the Moral Actions of Men are not to be guided by certain definite inviolable Rules there will be no longer found that Beauty Order and Agreement in the System of Rational Beings or Moral World which will then be all cover'd over with Darkness and Violence It is true he who stands close to a Palace can hardly make a right Judgment of the Architecture and Symmetry of its several Parts the nearer ever appearing disproportionably great And if we have a mind to take a fair Prospect of  the Order and general Wellbeing which the inflexible Laws of Nature and Morality derive on the World we must if I may so say go out of it and imagine our selves to be distant Spectators of all that is transacted and contained in it otherwise we are sure to be deceived by the too near View of the little present Interests of our Selves our Friends or our Country The right Understanding of what hath been said will I think afford a clear Solution to the following Difficulties  XXIX First it may perhaps seem to some that in Consequence of the foregoing Doctrine Men will be left to their own private Judgments as much as ever For First the very being of the Laws of Nature Secondly the  Criterion  whereby to know them and Thirdly the Agreement of any particular Precept with that  Criterion  are all to be discovered by Reason and Argumentation in which every Man doth necessarily judge for himself hence upon that Supposition there is Place for as great Confusion Unsteddiness and Contrariety of Opinions and Actions as upon any other I answer that however Men may differ as to what were most proper and beneficial to the Publick to be done or omitted on particular Occasions when they have for the most part narrow and interested Views yet in general Conclusions drawn from an equal and enlarged View of Things it is not possible there should be so great if any Disagreement at all amongst Candid Rational Enquirers after Truth  XXX Secondly The most plausible Pretence of all against the Doctrine we have premised concerning a rigid indispensible Observation of Moral Rules is that which is founded on the Consideration  of the Publick Weal for since the common Good of Mankind is confessedly the End which God requires shou'd be promoted by the free Actions of Men it may seem to follow that all good Men ought ever to have this in View as the great Mark to which all their Endeavours should be directed if therefore in any particular Case a strict keeping to the Moral Rule shall prove manifestly inconsistent with the Publick Good it may be thought agreeable to the Will of God that in that Case the Rule does not restrain an honest disinterested Person from acting for that End to which the Rule it self was Ordained For it is an Axiom that  the End is more Excellent than the Means  which deriving their Goodness from the End may not come in Competition with it  XXXI In Answer to this let it be observ'd that nothing is a  Law  merely because it conduceth to the Publick Good but because it is decreed by the Will of God which alone can give the Sanction of a  Law of Nature  to any Precept neither is any thing how expedient or plausible soever to be esteemed lawful on any other Account than its being coincident with or not repugnant to the Laws promulgated by the Voice of Nature and Reason It must indeed be allowed that the rational Deduction of those Laws is founded in the intrinsick Tendency they have to promote the Wellbeing of Mankind on Condition they are universally and constantly observed But tho' it afterwards comes to pass that they accidentally fail of that End or even promote the contrary they are nevertheless binding as hath been already proved In short that whole Difficulty may be resolved by the following Distinction In framing the general Laws of Nature it is granted we must  be entirely guided by the Publick Good of Mankind but not in the ordinary Moral Actions of our Lives Such a Rule if universally observ'd hath from the Nature of Things a necessary Fitness to promote the general Wellbeing of Mankind therefore it is a Law of Nature This is good Reasoning But if we shou'd say such an Action doth in this Instance produce much Good and no Harm to Mankind therefore it is lawful This were wrong The Rule is framed with respect to the Good of Mankind but our Practice must be always shaped immediately by the Rule They who think the Publick Good of a Nation to be the sole Measure of the Obedience due to the Civil Power seem not to have considered this Distinction  XXXII If it be said that some Negative Precepts  e g Thou shalt not kill  do admit of Limitation since otherwise it were unlawful for the Magistrate for a Soldier in a Battel or a Man in his own Defence to kill another I answer when a Duty is expressed in too general Terms as in this Instance in Order to a distinct Declaration of it either those Terms may be changed for others of a more limited Sense as  Kill  for  Murder  or else from the general Proposition remaining in its full Latitude Exceptions may be made of those precise Cases which not agreeing with the Notion of Murder are not prohibited by the Law of Nature In the former Case there is a Limitation but it is only of the Signification of a single Term too general and improper by substituting another more proper and particular in its Place In the latter Case there are Exceptions but then they are not from the Law of Nature but from a more general Proposition which besides that Law includes somewhat  more which must be taken away in order to eave the Law by it self clear and determinate From neither of which Concessions will it follow that any Negative Law of Nature is limited to those Cases only where its particular Application promotes the Publick Good or admits all other Cases to be excepted from it wherein its being actually observed produceth Harm to the Publick But of this I shall have Occasion to say more in the Sequel I have now done with the first Head which was to shew that there is an Absolute Unlimited Passive Obedience due to the Supreme Power whereever placed in any Nation and come to enquire into the Grounds and Reasons of the contrary Opinion which was the Second Thing proposed  XXXIII One great Principle which the Pleaders for Resistance make the GroundWork of their Doctrine is that the Law of SelfPreservation is  Prior  to all other Engagement being the very first and fundamental Law of Nature Hence say they Subjects are obliged by Nature and it is their Duty to resist the cruel Attempts of Tyrants however authorized by unjust and Bloody Laws which are nothing else but the Decrees of Men and consequently must give way to those of God or Nature But perhaps if we narrowly examine this Notion it will not be found so just and clear as some Men may imagine or indeed as at first Sight it seems to be For we ought to distinguish between a Twofold Signification of the Terms  Law of Nature  which Words do either denote ae Rule or Precept for the Direction of the voluntary Actions of reasonable Agents and in that Sense they imply a Duty or else they are used to signify any general Rule which we observe to obtain in  the Works of Nature independent of the Wills of Men in which Sense no Duty is implied And in this last Acceptation I grant it is a general Law of Nature that in every Animal there be implanted a Desire of SelfPreservation which tho' it is the earliest the deepest and most lasting of all whether Natural or Acquired Appetites yet cannot with any Propriety be termed a Moral Duty But if in the former Sense of the Words they mean that SelfPreservation is the first and most fundamental Law of Nature which therefore must take place of all other Natural or Moral Duties I think that Assertion to be manifestly false for this plain Reason because it wou'd thence follow a Man may lawfully commit any Sin whatsoever to preserve his Life than which nothing can be more absurd  XXXIV It cannot indeed be denied that the Law of Nature restrains us from doing those Things which may injure the Life of any Man and consequently our own But notwithstanding all that is said of the Obligativeness and Priority of the Law of SelfPreservation yet for ought I can see there is no particular Law which oblige any Man to prefer his own Temporal Good not even Life it self to that of another Man much less to the Observation of any one Moral Duty This is what we are too ready to perform of our own Accord and there is more Need of a Law to curb and restrain than there is of one to excite and inflame our SelfLove  XXXV But Secondly tho' we shou'd grant the Duty of SelfPreservation to be the first and most necessary of all the Positive or Affirmative Laws of Nature yet forasmuch as it is a Maxim  allowed by all Moralists that  Evil is never to be committed to the end Good may come of it  it will thence plainly follow that no Negative Precept ought to be transgressed for the sake of observing a Positive one and therefore since we have shewn  Thou shalt not resist the Supreme Power  to be a Negative Law of Nature it is a necessary Consequence that it may not be transgressed under pretence of fulfilling the Positive Duty of SelfPreservation  XXXVI A second erroneous Ground of our Adversaries whereon they lay a main Stress is that they hold the Publick Good of a particular Nation to be the Measure of the Obedience due from the Subject to the Civil Power which therefore may be resisted whensoever the Publick Good shall verily seem to require it But this Point hath been already consider'd and in Truth it can give small Difficulty to whoever understands Loyalty to be on the same Foot with other Moral Duties enjoyned in negative Precepts all which tho' equally calculated to promote the general Wellbeing may not nevertheless be limited or suspended under pretext of giving way to the end as is plain from what hath been premised on that Subject  XXXVII A Third Reason which they insist on is to this Effect All Civil Authority or Right is derived originally from the People but no Body can transfer that to another which he hath not himself therefore since no Man hath an absolute unlimited Right over his own Life the Subject cannot transfer such a Right to the Prince or Supreme Power who consequently hath no such unlimited Right to dispose of the Lives of his Subjects In case therefore a Subject resist his Prince who acting according to Law maketh an unjust  tho' legal Attempt on his Life he does him no Wrong since Wrong it is not to prevent another from seizing what he hath no Right to whence it shou'd seem to follow that agreeably to Reason the Prince or Supreme Power wheresoever placed may be resisted Having thus endeavoured to state their Argument in its clearest Light I make this Answer First it is granted no Civil Power hath an unlimited Right to dispose of the Life of any Man Secondly in case one Man resist another invading that which he hath no Right to it is granted he doth him no Wrong But in the Third Place I deny that it doth thence follow the Supreme Power may consonantly to Reason be resisted because that altho' such Resistance wronged not the Prince or Supreme Power wheresoever placed yet it were injurious to the Author of Nature and a Violation of his Law which Reason obligeth us to Transgress upon no Account whatsoever as hath been demonstrated  XXXVIII A Fourth Mistake or Prejudice which influenceth the Impugners of NonResistance arises from the natural Dread of Slavery Chains and Fetters which inspires them with an Aversion for any thing which even metaphorically comes under those Denominations Hence they cry out against us that we wou'd deprive them of their natural Freedom that we are making Chains for Mankind that we are for enslaving them and the like But how harsh soever the Sentence may appear yet it is most true that our Appetites even the most natural as of Ease Plenty or Life it self must be chain'd and fetter'd by the Laws of Nature and Reason This Slavery if they will call it so or Subjection of our Passions to the immutable Decrees of Reason though it may be  Galling to the sensual Part or the Beast yet sure I am it addeth much to the Dignity of that which is peculiarly Human in our Composition This leads me to the Fifth fundamental Error  XXXIX Namely the mistaking the Object of Passive Obedience We shou'd consider that when a Subject endures the Insolence and Oppression of one or more Magistrates armed with the Supreme Civil Power the Object of his Submission is in strict Truth nothing else but right Reason which is the Voice of the Author of Nature Think not we are so senseless as to imagine Tyrants cast in a better Mould than other Men No they are the worst and vilest of Men and for their own Sakes have not the least Right to our Obedience But the Laws of God and Nature must be obey'd and our Obedience to them is never more acceptable and sincere than when it exposeth us to Temporal Calamities  XL A Sixth false Ground of Persuasion to those we argue against is their not distinguishing between the Natures of Positive and Negative Duties For say they since our active Obedience to the Supreme Civil Power is acknowledged to be limited why may not our Duty of NonResistance be thought so too The Answer is plain because Positive and Negative Moral Precepts are not of the same Nature the former admitting such Limitations and Exceptions as the latter are on no Account liable to as hath been already proved It is very possible that a Man in obeying the Commands of his lawful Governors might transgress some Law of God contrary to them which it is not possible for him to do meerly by a patient Suffering and NonResistance for Conscience sake And this  furnishes such a Satisfactory and obvious Solution of the forementioned Difficulty that I am not a little surprized to see it insisted on by Men otherwise of good Sense and Reason And so much for the Grounds and Reasons of the Adversaries of NonResistance I now proceed to the third and last Thing proposed Namely the Consideration of the Objections drawn from the pretended Consequences of NonResistance  XLI First then it will be objected that in Consequence of that Notion we must believe that God hath in several Instances laid the innocent Part of Mankind under an unavoidable Necessity of enduring the greatest Sufferings and Hardships without any Remedy which is plainly inconsistent with the Divine Wisdom and Goodness and therefore the Principle from whence that Consequence flows ought not to be admitted as a Law of God of Nature In Answer to which I observe we must carefully distinguish between the necessary and accidental Consequences of a Moral Law The former Kind are those which the Law is in its own Nature calculated to produce and which have an inseparable Connexion with the Observation of it and indeed if these are bad we may justly conclude the Law to be so too and consequently not from God But the accidental Consequences of a Law have no intrinsic natural Connexion with nor do they strictly speaking flow from its Observation but are the genuine Result of something foreign and circumstantial which happens to be joyned with it And these accidental Consequences of a very good Law may nevertheless be very bad which Badness of theirs is to be charged on their own proper and necessary Cause and not on the Law which hath no Essential Tendency  to produce them Now though it must be granted that a Lawgiver infinitely wise and good will constitute such Laws for the Regulation of human Actions as have in their own Nature a necessary inherent Aptness to promote the common Good of all Mankind and that in the greatest Degree that the present Circumstances and Capacities of human Nature will admit yet we deny that the Wisdom and Goodness of the Lawgiver are concerned or may be called in Question on Account of the particular Evils which arise necessarily and properly from the  Transgression  of some one or more good Laws and but accidentally from the  Observation  of others But it is plain that the several Calamities and Devastations which oppressive Governments bring on the World are not the genuine necessary Effects of the Law that enjoineth a Passive Subjection to the Supreme Power neither are they included in the primary Intention thereof but spring from Avarice Ambition Cruelty Revenge and the like inordinate Affections and Vices raging in the Breasts of Governors They may not therefore argue a defect of Wisdom or Goodness in God's Law but of Righteousness in Men  XLII Such is the present State of Things so irregular are the Wills and so unrestrained the Passions of Men that we every Day see manifest Breaches and Violations of the Laws of Nature which being always committed in Favour of the Wicked must surely be sometimes attended with heavy Disadvantages and Miseries on the Part of those who by a firm Adhesion to his Laws endeavour to approve themselves in the Eyes of their Creator There are in short no Rules of Morality not excepting the best but what may subject  good Men to great Sufferings and Hardships which necessarily follows from the Wickedness of those they have to deal with and but accidentally from those good Rules And as on the one Hand it were inconsistent with the Wisdom of God by suffering a retaliation of Fraud Perjury or the like on the Head of Offenders to punish one Transgression by another So on the other Hand it were inconsistent with his Justice to leave the Good and Innocent a hopeless Sacrifice to the Wicked God therefore hath appointed a Day of Retribution in another Life and in this we have his Grace and a good Conscience for our Support We shou'd not therefore repine at the Divine Laws or shew a frowardness or impatience of those transient Sufferings they accidentally expose us to which however grating to Flesh and Blood will yet seem of small moment if we compare the littleness and fleetingness of this present World with the Glory and Eternity of the next  XLIII From what hath been said I think it is plain that the premised Doctrine of NonResistance were safe tho' the Evils incurred thereby shou'd be allowed never so great But perhaps upon a strict examination they will be found much less than by many they are thought to be The mischievous effects which are charged on that Doctrine may be reduced to these two Points First that it is an encouragement for all Governors to become Tyrants by the prospect it gives them of Impunity or NonResistance Secondly that it renders the Oppression and Cruelty of those who are Tyrants more insupportable and violent by cutting off all Opposition and consequently all means of Redress I shall consider each of these distinctly As to the first Point either you'll suppose  the Governors to be good or ill Men If they are Good there is no fear of their becoming Tyrants And if they are ill Men that is such as postpone the Observation of God's Laws to the satisfying of their own Lusts then it can be no Security to them that others will rigidly observe those Moral Precepts which they find themselves so prone to Transgress  XLIV It is indeed a Breach of the Law of Nature for a Subject tho' under the greatest and most unjust Sufferings to lift up his Hand against the Supreme Power But it is a more heinous and inexcusable Violation of it for the Persons invested with the Supreme Power to use that Power to the Ruin and Destruction of the People committed to their Charge What encouragement therefore can any Man have to think that others will not be push'd on by the strong implanted Appetite of SelfPreservation to commit a Crime when he himself commits a more brutish and unnatural Crime perhaps without any provocation at all Or is it to be imagined that they who daily break God's Laws for the sake of some little Profit or transient Pleasure will not be tempted by the love of Property Liberty or Life it self to Transgress that single Precept which forbids Resistance to the Supreme Power  XLV But it will be demanded to what purpose then is this Duty of NonResistance Preached and Proved and Recommended to our Practice if in all likelihood when things come to an extremity Men will never observe it I Answer to the very same purpose that any other Duty is Preached For what Duty is there which many too many upon some consideration or other may  not be prevail'd on to Transgress Moralists and Divines do not Preach the Duties of Nature and Religion with the View of Gaining Mankind to a perfect Observation of them that they know is not to be done But however our Pains are Answered if we can make Men less Sinners than otherwise they wou'd be if by opposing the force of Duty to that of present Interest and Passion we can get the better of some Temptations and Balance others while the greatest still remain Invincible  XLVI But granting those who are invested with the Supreme Power to have all imaginable Security that no cruel and barbarous Treatment whatever cou'd provoke their Subjects to Rebellion Yet I believe it may be justly questioned whether such Security would tempt them to more or greater Acts of Cruelty than Jealousie Distrust Suspicion and Revenge may do in a State less Secure And so far in consideration of the first Point Namely that the Doctrine of NonResistance is an encouragement for Governors to become Tyrants  XLVII The second Mischievous Effect it was Charged with is that it renders the Oppression and Cruelty of those who are Tyrants more insupportable and violent by cutting off all Opposition and consequently all means of Redress But if things are rightly consider'd it will appear that Redressing the Evils of Government by Force is at best a very hazardous Attempt and what often puts the Publick in a worse State than it was before For either you suppose the Power of the Rebels to be but small and easily Crushed and then this is apt to inspire the Governors with Confidence  and Cruelty Or in case you suppose it more considerable so as to be a Match for the Supreme Power supported by the Publick Treasure Forts and Armies and that the whole Nation is engaged in a Civil War the certain effects of this are Rapine Bloodshed Misery and Confusion to all Orders and Parties of Men greater and more insupportable by far than are known under any the most absolute and severe Tyranny upon Earth And it may be that after much mutual Slaughter the Rebellious Party will prevail And if they do prevail to Destroy the Government in Being it may be they will Substitute a better in its Place or change it into better Hands And may not this come to pass without the expence and toil and blood of War Is not the Heart of a Prince in the Hand of God May he not therefore give him a right Sense of his Duty or may he not call him out of the World by Sickness Accident or the Hand of some desperate Ruffian and send a better in his Stead When I speak as of a Monarchy I would be understood to mean all sorts of Government wheresoever the Supreme Power is Lodged Upon the whole I think we may close with the Heathen Philosopher who thought it the part of a Wise Man never to attempt the Change of Government by Force when it cou'd not be mended without the Slaughter and Banishment of his Countrymen But to Sit still and Pray for better Times  Plato  in Epist    For this way may do and the other may not do there is uncertainty in both Courses The difference is that in the way of Rebellion we are sure to increase the Publick Calamities for a time at least tho' we are not sure of lessening them for the future  XLVIII But tho' it should be acknowledged that in the main Submission and Patience ought to be recommended yet Men will be still apt to demand whether extraordinary Cases may not require extraordinary Measures and therefore in case the Oppression be insupportable and the Prospect of Deliverance sure whether Rebellion may not be allowed of I Answer By no means Perjury or Breach of Faith may in some possible Cases bring great Advantage to a Nation by freeing it from Conditions inconsistent with its Liberty and Publick Welfare So likewise may Adultery by procuring a Domestick Heir prevent a Kingdom's falling into the Hands of a Foreign Power which wou'd in all probability prove its Ruin Yet will any Man say the extraordinary Nature of those Cases can take away the Guilt of Perjury and Adultery This is what I will not suppose But it hath been shewn that Rebellion is as truly a Crime against Nature and Reason as either of the foregoing it may not therefore be Justified upon any Account whatever any more than they  XLIX What Must we then Submit our Necks to the Sword And is there no Help no Refuge against extream Tyranny established by Law In Answer to this I say in the first place it is not to be feared that Men in their Wits shou'd seek the Destruction of their People by such cruel and unnatural Decrees as some are forward to suppose I say Secondly that in case they shou'd yet most certainly the Subordinate Magistrates may not nay they ought not in Obedience to those Decrees to act any thing contrary to the express Laws of God And perhaps all things considered it  will be thought that representing this Limitation of their active Obedience by the Laws of God or Nature as a Duty to the Ministers of the Supreme Power may prove in those extravagant supposed Cases no less effectual for the Peace and Safety of a Nation than Preaching up the Power of Resistance to the People  L Further It will probably be Objected as an Absurdity in the Doctrine of Passive Obedience that it enjoyneth Subjects a blind implicit Submission to the Decrees of other Men which is unbecoming the Dignity and Freedom of reasonable Agents who indeed ought to pay Obedience to their Superiors but it shou'd be a rational Obedience such as arises from a knowledge of the Equity of their Laws and the Tendency they have to promote the Public Good To which I Answer That it is not likely a Government shou'd suffer much for want of having its Laws inspected and amended by those who are not legally intitled to a share in the management of Affairs of that Nature And it must be confessed the Bulk of Mankind are by their Circumstances and Occupations so far unqualified to judge of such Matters that they must necessarily pay an implicit deference to some or other and to whom so properly as to those invested with the Supreme Power  LI There is another Objection against absolute Submission which I shou'd not have mentioned but that I find it insisted on by Men of so great Note as  Grotius  and  Pufendorf  Grotius de jure Belli Pacis    l    c    s    Pufendorf de jure naturae gentium    l    c    s    who think our NonResistance shou'd be measured by the intention  of those who first framed the Society Now say they if we suppose the question put to them Whether they meant to lay every Subject under a Necessity of chusing Death rather than in any Case to Resist the Cruelty of his Superiors it cannot be imagined they wou'd Answer in the Affirmative For this were to put themselves in a worse Condition than that which they endeavoured to avoid by entring into Society For altho' they were obnoxious to the Injuries of many they had nevertheless the Power of Resisting them But now they are bound without any Opposition at all to endure the greatest Injuries from those whom they have Armed with their own Strength Which is by so much worse than the former State as the undergoing an Execution is worse than the hazard of a Battle But passing by all other Exceptions which this Method of arguing may be liable to it is evident that a Man had better be exposed to the absolute irresistible Decrees even of one single Person whose own and Posterities true Interest it is to preserve him in Peace and Plenty and Protect him from the Injuries of all Mankind beside than remain an open Prey to the Rage and Avarice of every Wicked Man upon Earth who either exceeds him in Strength or takes him at an Advantage The Truth of this is confirmed as well by the constant Experience of the far greater Part of the World as by what we have already observ'd concerning Anarchy and the Inconsistence of such a State with that manner of Life which Human Nature requires Hence it is plain the Objection last mentioned is Built on a false Supposition  Viz  That Men by quitting the Natural State of Anarchy for that of absolute NonResisting Obedience to Government wou'd put themselves in a worse Condition than they were in before  LII The last Objection I shall take Notice of is that in pursuance of the premised Doctrine where no Exceptions no Limitations are to be allowed of it shou'd seem to follow Men were bound to submit without making any Opposition to Usurpers or even Madmen possessed of the Supreme Authority Which is a Notion so absurd and repugnant to common Sense that the Foundation on which it is Built may justly be called in Question Now in order to clear this Point I observe the Limitation of Moral Duties may be understood in a Twofold Sense either first as a Distinction applied to the Terms of a Proposition whereby that which was expressed before too generally is limited to a particular Acceptation and this in truth is not so properly limiting the Duty as defining it Or Secondly it may be understood as a Suspending the Observation of a Duty for avoiding some extraordinary Inconvenience and thereby confining it to certain Occasions And in this last Sense only We have shewn Negative Duties not to admit of Limitation Namely that by Vertue of the Duty of  NonResistance  We are not obliged to Submit the Disposal of our Lives and Fortunes to the Discretion either of Madmen or of all those who by Craft or Violence invade the Supreme Power Because the Object of the Submission enjoyned Subjects by the Law of Nature is from the Reason of the thing Manifestly limited so as to exclude both the one and the other Which I shall not go about to prove because I believe no Body has denied it Nor doth the Annexing such Limits to the Object of our Obedience at all limit the Duty it self in the Sense we except against  LIII In the Various Changes and Fluctuations of Government it is impossible to prevent that Controversies shou'd sometimes arise concerning the Seat of the Supreme Power And in such Cases Subjects cannot be Denied the Liberty of Judging for Themselves or of taking part with some and opposing others according to the best of their Judgments all which is Consistent with an exact Observation of their Duty so long as when the Constitution is clear in the Point and the Object of their Submission undoubted no Pretext of Interest Friends or the Publick Good can make them depart from it In short it is acknowledged that the Precept enjoyning NonResistance is Limited to particular Objects but not to particular Occasions And in this it is like all other Moral Negative Duties which consider'd as general Propositions do admit of Limitations and Restrictions in order to a distinct Definition of the Duty but what is once known to be a Duty of that sort can never become otherwise by any good or ill Effect Circumstance or Event whatsoever And in Truth if it were not so if there were no General Inflexible Rules but all Negative as well as Positive Duties might be Dispensed with and Warpt to Serve particular Interests and Occasions there were an end of all Morality  LIV It is therefore Evident that as the Observation of any other Negative Moral Law is not to be limited to those Instances only where it may produce good Effects so neither is the Observation of NonResistance limited in such sort as that any Man may Lawfully Transgress it whensoever in his Judgment the Publick Good of his Particular Country shall require it And it is with Regard  to this Limitation by the Effects that I speak of NonResistance as an absolute unconditioned unlimited Duty Which must inevitably be granted unless one of these three Things can be prov'd Either First that  NonResistance  is no Moral Duty Or Secondly that other Negative Moral Duties are limited by the Effects Or Lastly that there is something peculiar in the Nature of  NonResistance  which necessarily subjects it to such a Limitation as no other Negative Moral Duty can admit The contrary to each of which Points if I mistake not hath been clearly made out  LV I have now briefly gone through the Objections drawn from the Consequences of NonResistance which was the last General Head I proposed to Treat of In handling this and the other Points I have endeavour'd to be as full and clear as the usual length of these Discourses would permit and throughout to consider the Argument with the same Indifference as I shou'd any other part of General Knowledge being verily perswaded that Men as Christians are obliged to the Practice of no one Moral Duty which may not abide the severest Test of Reason  FINIS
