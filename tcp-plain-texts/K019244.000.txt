 THE TATLER  ADVERTISEMENT  THE papers of MR ADDISON published by Sir Richard Steele in the Tatler are now collected into one volume and published by themselves Nothing can be a greater encomium on them than what Sir Richard has acknowleged in the last number of that collection  "Their excellence now may be best gathered from their having given so long a vogue to that vast heap of crude and undigested things with which they are intermixed"  Pope's Works V vo Edit  THE TATLER  BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOSEPH ADDISON  ESQ  GLASGOW  Printed by ROBERT URIE MDCCLIV  THE TATLER  No Thursday May  THOUGH the theatre is now breaking it is allowed still to sell animals there therefore if any lady or gentleman have occasion for a tame elephant let them enquire of Mr Pinkethman who has one to dispose of at a reasonable rate The downfal of MayFaire has quite sunk the price of this noble creature as well as of many other curiosities of nature A tiger will sell almost as cheap as an ox and I am credibly informed a man may purchase a cat with three legs for very near the value of one with four I hear likewise that there is a great desolation among the gentlemen and ladies who were the ornaments of the town and used to shine in plumes and diadems the heroes being most of them pressed and the queens beating hemp Mrs Sarabrand so famous for her ingenious puppetshow has set up a shop in the Exchange where she sells her little troop under the term of jointed babies I could not but be sollicitous to know of her how she had disposed of that rake hell Punch whose lewd life and conversation had given so much scandal and did not a little contribute to the ruin of the faire She told me with a sigh that despairing of ever reclaiming him she would not offer to place him in a civil family but got him in a post upon a stall in Wapping where he may be seen from sunrising to sunsetting with a glass in one hand and a pipe in the other as centry to a brandyshop The great revolutions of this nature bring to my mind the distresses of the unfortunate Camilla  who has had the ill luck to break before her voice and to disappear at a time when her beauty was in the height of its bloom This lady entered so throughly into the great characters she acted that when she had finished her part she could not think of retrenching her equipage but would appear in her own lodgings with the same magnificence that she did upon the stage This greatness of soul has reduced that unhappy princess to an involuntary retirement where she now passes her time among the woods and forests

known she usually sings it in Italian  Naqui al Regno naqui al Trono  E pur sono  Iventurata Pastorella  Since I have touched upon this subject I shall communicate to my reader part of a letter I have received from a friend at Amsterdam where there is a very noble theatre though the manner of furnishing it with actors is something peculiar to that place and gives us occasion to admire both the politeness and frugality of the people  'MY friends have kept me here a week longer than ordinary to see one of their plays which was performed last night with great applause The actors are all of them tradesmen who after their day's work is over earn about a gilder a night by personating kings and generals The hero of the tragedy I saw was a journeyman taylor and his first minister of state a coffeeman The empress made me think of Parthenope in  the Rehearsal for her mother keeps an alehouse in the suburbs of Amsterdam When the tragedy was over they entertained us with a short farce in which the cobler did his part to a miracle but upon enquiry I found he had really been working at his own trade and representing on the stage what he acted every day in his shop The profits of the theatre maintain an hospital for as here they do not think the profession of an actor the only trade that a man ought to exercise so they will not allow anybody to grow rich on a profession that in their opinion so little conduces to the good of the commonwealth If I am not mistaken your playhouses in England have done the same thing for unless I am misinformed the hospital at Dulledge was erected and endowed by Mr Allen a player and it is also said a famous shetragedian has settled her estate after her death for the maintenance of decayed wits who are to be taken in as soon as they grow dull at whatever time of their life that shall happen'  No Saturday July  Celebrare domestica facta  THIS is to give notice that a magnificent palace with great variety of gardens statues and

battle when we show our martial skill in each line and according to the space we have to fill we range our men in squadrons and battalions or draw out company by company and troop by troop ever

men enough into the field and whereever they are raised never to lose a battle for want of numbers  No Saturday October  From my own apartment  September  I AM called off from public dissertations by a domestic affair of great importance which is no less than the disposal of my sister Jenny for life The girl is a girl of great merit and pleasing conversation but I being born of my father's first wife and she of his third she converses with me rather like a daughter than a sister I have indeed told her that if she kept her honour and behaved herself in such a manner as became the Bickerstaffs I would get her an agreeable man for her husband which was a promise I made her after reading a passage in Pliny's Epistles That polite author had been employed to find out a consort for his friend's daughter and gives the following character of the man he had pitched upon  Aciliano plurimum vigoris et industriae quanquam in maxima verecundia est illi facies liberalis multo sanguine multo rubore suffusa est ingenua totius corporis pulchritudo et quidam senatorius decor quae ego nequaquam arbitror negligenda debet enim hoc castitati puellarum quasi praemium dari  'Acilianus is a man of extraordinary vigour and industry accompanied with the greatest modesty He has very much of the gentleman with a lively colour and flush of health in his aspect His whole person is finely turned and speaks him a man of quality which are qulifications that I think ought by no means to be overlooked and should be bestowed on a daughter as the reward of her chastity'  A woman that will give herself liberties need not put her parents to so much trouble for if she does not possess these ornaments in a husband she can supply herself elsewhere But this is not the case of my sister Jenny who I may say without vanity is as unspotted a spinster  as any in Great Britain I shall take this occasion to recommend the conduct of our own family in this particular  We have in the genealogy of our house the descriptions and pictures of our ancestors from the time of king Arthur in whose days there was one of my own name a knight of his round table and known by the name of Sir Isaac Bickerstaff He was low of stature and of a very swarthy complexion not unlike a Portuguese Jew But he was more prudent than men of that height usually are and would often communicate to his friends his design of lengthening and whitening his posterity His eldest son Ralph for that was his name was for this reason married to a lady who had little else to recommend her but that she was very tall and fair The issue of this match with the help of his shoes made a tolerable figure in the next age though the complexion of the family was obscure 'till the fourth generation from that marriage From which time till the reign of William the Conqueror the females of our house were famous for their needlework and fine skins In the male line there happened an unlucky accident in the reign of Richard the third the eldest son of Philip then chief of the family being born with an humpback and very high nose This was the more astonishing because none of his forefathers ever had such a blemish nor indeed was there any in the neighbourhood of that make except the butler who was noted for round shoulders and a Roman nose what made the nose the less excusable was the remarkable smallness of his eyes  The several defects were mended by succeeding matches his eyes were opened in the next generation and the hump fell in a century and half but the greatest difficulty was how to reduce the nose which I do not find was accomplished till about the middle of Henry the seventh's reign or rather the beginning of that of Henry the eighth  But while our ancestors were thus taken up in cultivating  the eyes and nose the face of the Bickerstaffs fell down insensibly into chin which was not taken notice of their thoughts being so much employed upon the more noble features till it became almost too long to be remedied  But length of time and successive care in our alliances have cured this also and reduced our faces into that tolerable oval which we enjoy at present I would not be tedious in this discourse but cannot but observe that our race suffered very much about three hundred years ago by the marriage of one of her heiresses with an eminent courtier who gave us spindleshanks and cramps in our bones insomuch that we did not recover our health and legs till Sir Walter Bickerstaff married Maud the milkmaid of whom the then Garter king at arms a facetious person said pleasantly enough that she had spoiled our blood but mended our constitutions  After this account of the effect our prudent choice of matches has had upon our persons and features I cannot but observe that there are daily instances of as great changes made by marriage upon men's minds and humours One might wear any passion out of a family by culture as skilful gardiners blot a colour out of a tulip that hurts its beauty One might produce an affable temper out of a shrew by grasting the mild upon the choleric or raise a jackpudding from a prude by inoculating mirth and melancholy It is for want of care in the disposing of our children with regard to our bodies and minds that we go into an house and see such different complexions and humours in the same race and family But to me it is as plain as a pikestaff from what mixture it is that this daughter silently lowers the other steals a kind lock at you a third is exactly well behaved a fourth a splenatic and a fifth a coquerte  In this disposal of my sister I have chosen with an eye to ber being a wit and provided that the bridegroom be a man of a found and excellent jedgment who will seldom mind what she says when she begins to  harangue for Jenny's only imperfection is an admiration of her parts which inclines her to be a little but a very little sluttish and you are ever to remark that we are apt to cultivate most and bring into observation what we think most excellent in ourselves or most capable of improvement Thus my sister instead of consulting her glass and her toilet for an hour and an half after her private devotion sits with her nose full of snuff and a man's nightcap on her head reading plays and romances Her wit she thinks her distinction therefore knows nothing of the skill of dress or making her person agreeable It would make you laugh to see me often with my spectacles on lacing her stays for she is so very a wit that she understands no ordinary thing in the world  For this reason I have disposed of her to a man of business who will soon let her see that to be well dressed in good humour and chearful in the command of her family are the arts and sciences of female life I could have bestowed her upon a fine gentleman who extremely admired her wit and would have given her a coach and six but I found it absolutely necessary to cross the strain for had they met they had eternally been rivals in discourse and in continual contention for the superiority of understanding and brought forth critics pedants or pretty good poets  As it is I expect an offspring fit for the habitation of city town or country creatures that are docile and tractable in whatever we put them to  To convince men of the necessity of taking this method let any one even below the skill of an astrologer behold the turn of faces he meets as soon as he passes Cheapsideconduit and you see a deep attention and a certain unthinking sharpness in every countenance They look attentive but their thoughts are engaged on mean purposes To me it is very apparent when I see a citizen pass by whether his head is upon woollen silks iron sugar indigo or stocks Now this trace of  thought appears or lies hid in the race for two or three generations  I know at this time a person of a vast estate who is the immediate descendant of a fine gentleman but the greatgrandson of a broker in whom his ancestor is now revived He is a very honest gentleman in his principles but cannot for his blood talk fairly he is heartily sorry for it but he cheats by constitution and overreaches by instinct  The happiness of the man who marries my sister will be that he has no faults to correct in her but her own a little byass of fancy or particularity of manners which grew in herself and can be amended by her From such an untainted couple we can hope to have our family rise to its ancient splendor of face air countenance manner and shape without discovering the product of ten nations in one house Obadiah Greenhat says he never comes into any company in England but he distinguishes the different nations of which we are composed there is scarce such a living creature as a true Britain We sit down indeed all friends acquaintance and neighbours but after two bottles you see a Dane start up and swear the kingdom is his own A Saxon drinks up the whole quart and swears he will dispute that with him A Norman tells them both he will assert his liberty and a Welshman cries they are all foreigners and intruders of yesterday and beats them out of the room Such accidents happen frequently among neighbours children and cousingermans For which reason I say study your race or the soil of your family will dwindle into cits or 'squires or run up into wits or madmen  Sir  Richard Steel  assisted in this paper  No Saturday October  Hic manus ob partriam pugnando vulnera passi  Quique pii Vates et Phoebo digna locuti  Inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes  Quique sui memores alios fecere merendo  VIRG  From my own apartment  October  THERE are two kinds of immortality that which the soul really enjoys after this life and that imaginary existence by which men live in their fame and reputation The best and greatest actions have proceeded from the prospect of the one or other of these but my design is to treat only of those who have chiefly proposed to themselves the latter as the principal reward of their labours It was for this reason that I excluded from my tables of fame all the great founders and votaries of religion and it is for this reason also that I am more than ordinarily anxious to do justice to the persons of whom I am now going to speak for since Fame was the only end of all their enterprizes and studies a man cannot be too scrupulous in allotting them their due proportion of it It was this consideration which made me call the whole body of the learned to my assistance to many of whom I must own my obligations for the catalogues of illustrious persons which they have sent me in upon this occasion I yesterday employed the whole afternoon in comparing them with each other which made so strong an impression upon my imagination that they broke my sleep for the first part of the following night and at length threw me into a very agreeable vision which I shall beg leave to describe in all its particulars  I dreamed that I was conveyed into a wide and boundless plain that was covered with prodigious multitudes  of people which no man could number In the midst of it there stood a mountain with its head above the clouds The sides were extremely steep and of such a particular structure that no creature which was not made in a human figure could possibly ascend it On a sudden there was heard from the top of it a sound like that of a trumpet but so exceeding sweet and harmonious that it filled the hearts of those who heard it with raptures and gave such high and delightful sensations as seemed to animate and raise human nature above itself This made me very much amazed to find so very few in that innumerable multitude who had ears fine enough to hear or relish this music with pleasure but my wonder abated when upon looking round me I saw most of them attentive to three sirens clothed like goddesses and distinguished by the names of Sloth Ignorance and Pleasure They were seated on three rocks amidst a beautiful variety of groves meadows and rivulets that lay on the borders of the mountain While the base and groveling multitude of different nations ranks and ages were listening to these delusive deities those of a more erect aspect and exalted spirit separated themselves from the rest and marched in great bodies towards the mountain from whence they heard the sound which still grew sweeter the more they listened to it  On a sudden methought this select band sprang forward with a resolution to climb the ascent and follow the call of that heavenly music Every one took something with him that he thought might be of assistance to him in his march Several had their swords drawn some carried rolls of paper in their hands some had compasses others quadrants others telescopes and others pencils some had laurels on their heads and others buskings on their legs in short there was scarce any instrument of a mechanic art or a liberal science which was not made use of on this occasion My good Daemon who stood at my right hand during the course  of this whole vision observing in me a kind of burning desire to join that glorious company told me he highly approved that generous ardor with which I seemed transported but at the same time advised me to cover my face with a mask all the while I was to labour on the ascent I took his counsel without inquiring into his reasons The whole body now broke into different parties and began to climb the precipice by ten thousand different paths Several got into little allies which did not reach far up the hill before they ended and led no further and I observed that most of the artizans which considerably diminished our number fell into these paths  We left another considerable body of adventurers behind us who thought they had discovered byways up the hill which proved so very intricate and perplexed that after having advanced in them a little they were quite lost among the several turns and windings and though they were as active as any in their motions they made but little progress in the ascent These as my guide informed me were men of subtle tempers and puzzled politics who would supply the place of real wisdom with cunning and artifice Among those who were far advanced in their way there were some that by one false step fell backward and lost more ground in a moment than they had gained for many hours or could be ever able to recover We were now advanced very high and observed that all the different paths which ran about the sides of the mountain began to meet in two great roads which insensibly gathered the whole multitude of travellers into two great bodies At a little distance from the enterance of each road there stood an hideous phantom that opposed our further passage One of these apparitions had his right hand filled with darts which he brandished in the face of all who came up that way Crouds ran back at the appearance of it and cried out  Death  The spectre that guarded the other road was  Envy  she was not armed  with weapons of destruction like the former but by dreadful hissings noises of reproach and a horrid distracted laughter she appeared more frightful than death itself insomuch that abundance of our company were discouraged from passing any further and some appeared ashamed of having come so far As for myself I must confess my heart shrunk within me at the sight of these ghastly appearances but on a sudden the voice of the trumpet came more full upon us so that we felt a new resolution reviving in us and in proportion as this resolution grew the terrors before us seemed to vanish Most of the company who had swords in their hands marched on with great spirit and an air of defiance up the road that was commanded by Death while others who had thought and contemplation in their looks went forward in a more composed manner up the road possessed by Envy The way above these apparations grew smooth and uniform and was so delightful that the travellers went on with pleasure and in a little time arrived as the top of the mountain They here began to breathe a delicious kind of aether and saw all the fields about them covered with a kind of purple light that made them reflect with satisfaction on their past toils and diffused a secret joy through the whole assembly which shewed itself in every look and feature In the midst of these happy fields there stood a palace of a very glorious structure it had four great foldingdoors that faced the four several quarters of the world On the top of it was enthroned the goddess of the mountain who smiled upon her votaries and sounded the silver trumpet which had called them up and cheared them in their passage to her palace They had now formed themselves into several divisions a band of historians taking their stations at each door according to the persons whom they were to introduce  On a sudden the trumpet which had hitherto sounded only a march or a point of war now swelled all its notes into triumph and exultation the whole fabric  shook and the doors flew open The first who stepped forward was a beautiful and blooming hero and as I heard by the murmurs round me Alexander the Great He was conducted by a croud of historians The person who immediately walked before him was remarkable for an embroidered garment who not being well acquainted with the place was conducting him to an apartment appointed for the reception of fabulous heroes The name of this false guide was Quintus Curtius But Arrian and Plutarch who knew better the avenues of this palace conducted him into the great hall and placed him at the upper end of the first table My good Daemon that I might see the whole ceremony conveyed me to a corner of this room where I might perceive all that passed without being seen myself The next who entered was a charming virgin leading in a venerable old man that was blind Under her left arm she bore a harp and on her head a garland Alexander who was very well acquainted with Homer stood up at his enterance and placed him on his right hand The virgin who it seems was one of the nine sisters that attended on the goddess of Fame smiled with an ineffable grace at their meeting and retired  Julius Caesar was now coming forward and though most of the historians offered their service to introduce him he left them at the door and would have no conductor but himself  The next who advanced was a man of a homely but chearful aspect and attended by persons of greater figure than any that appeared on this occasion Plato was on his right hand and Xenophon on his left He bowed to Homer and sat down by him It was expected that Plato would himself have taken a place next to his master Socrates but on a sudden there was heard a great clamour of disputants at the door who appeared with Aristotle at the head of them That philosopher with some rudeness but great strength of reason convinced  the whole table that a title to the fifth place was his due and took it accordingly  He had scarce sat down when the same beautiful virgin that had introduced Homer brought in another who hung back at the enterance and would have excushimself had not his modesty been overcome by the invitation of all who sat at the table His guide and behaviour made me easily conclude it was Virgil Cicero next appeared and took his place He had inquired at the door for Lucceius to introduce him but not finding him there he contented himself with the attendance of many other writers who all except Sallust appeared highly pleased with the office  We waited some time in expectation of the next worthy who came in with a great retinue of historians whose names I could not learn most of them being natives of Carthage The person thus conducted who was Hannibal seemed much disturbed and could not forbear complaining to the board of the affronts he had met with among the Roman historians who attempted says he to carry me into the subterraneous apartment and perhaps would have done it had it not been for the impartiality of this gentleman pointing to Polybius who was the only person except my own countrymen that was willing to conduct me hither  The Carthaginian took his seat and Pompey entered with great dignity in his own person and preceded by several historians Lucan the poet was at the head of them who observing Homer and Virgil at the table was going to sit down himself had not the latter whispered him that whatever pretence he might otherwise have had he forseited his claim to it by coming in as one of the historians Lucan was so exasperated with the repulse that he muttered something to himself and was heard to say that since he could not have a seat among them himself he would bring in one who alone had more merit than their whole assembly upon which he went to the door and brought in Cato of Utica That  great man approached the company with such an air that shewed he contemned the honour which he laid a claim to Observing the seat opposite to Caesar was vacant he took possession of it and spoke two or three smart sentences upon the nature of precedency which according to him consisted not in place but in intrinsic merit to which he added that the most virtuous man whereever he was seated was always at the upper end of the table Socrates who had a great spirit of raillery with his wisdom could not forbear smiling at a virtue which took so little pains to make itself agreeable Cicero took the occasion to make a long discourse in praise of Cato which he uttered with much vehemence Caesar answered with a great deal of seeming temper but as I stood at a great distance from them I was not able to hear one word of what they said But I could not forbear taking notice that in all the discourse which passed at the table a word or a nod from Homer decided the controversy  After a short pause Augustus appeared looking round him with a serene and affable countenance upon all the writers of his age who strove among themselves which of them should show him the greatest marks of gratitude and respect Virgil rose from the table to meet him and though he was an acceptable guest to all he appeared more such to the learned than the military worthies The next man astonished the whole table with his appearance he was slow solemn and silent in his behaviour and wore a raiment curiously wrought with hieroglyphics As he came into the middle of the room he threw back the skirt of it and discovered a golden thigh Socrates at the sight of it declared against keeping company with any who were not made of flesh and blood and therefore desired Diogenes the Laertian to lead him to the apartment allotted for fabulous heroes and worthies of dubious existence At his going out he told them that they did not know whom they dismissed that he was now Pythagoras the first of  philosophers and that formerly he had been a brave man at the siege of Troy That may be very true said Socrates but you forget that you have likewise been a very great harlot in your time This exclusion made way for Archimedes who came forward with a scheme of mathematical figures in his hand among which I observed a cone or cylinder  Seeing this table full I desired my guide for variety to lead me to the fabulous apartment the roof of which was painted with gorgons chimera's and centaurs with many other emblematical figures which I wanted both time and skill to unriddle The first table was almost full At the upper end sat Hercules leaning an arm upon his club On his right hand were Achilles and Ulysses and between them Aeneas On his left were Hector Theseus and Jason The lower end had Orpheus Aesop Phalaris and Musaeus The ushers seemed at a loss for a twelfth man when methought to my great joy and surprize I heard some at the lower end of the table mention Isaac Bickerstaff but those of the upper end received it with disdain and said if they must have a British worthy they would have Robin Hood  '  This last paragraph written by Sir  R Steele  While I was transported with the honour that was done me and burning with envy against my competitor I was awakened by the noise of the cannon which were then fired for the taking of Mons I should have been very much troubled at being thrown out of so pleasing a vision on any other occasion but thought it an agreeable change to have my thoughts diverted from the greatest among the dead and fabulous heroes to the most famous among the real and the living'  No Thursday October  From my own apartment  October  When I came home last night my servant delivered me the following letter  Octob  SIR  I HAVE orders from Sir Harry Quickset of Staffordshire Bar to acquaint you that his honour Sir Harry himself Sir Giles Wheelbarrow Kt Thomas Rentfree  Esq  justice of the Quorum Andrew Windmill  Esq  and Mr Nicholas Doubt of the InnerTemple Sir Harry's grandson will wait upon you at the hour of nine tomorrow morning being Tuesday the th of October upon business which Sir Harry will impart to you by word of mouth I thought it proper to acquaint you beforehand so many persons of quality came that you might not be surprized therewith Which concludes though by many years absence since I saw you at Stafford unknown  SIR  Your most humble servant John Thrifty  I received this message with less surprize than I believed Mr Thrifty imagined for I knew the good company too well to feel any palpitations at their approach but I was in very great concern how I should adjust the ceremonial and demean myself to all these great men who perhaps had not seen any thing above themselves for these twenty years last past I am sure that is the case of Sir Harry Besides which I was sensible that there was a great point in adjusting my behaviour  to the simple 'squire so as to give him satisfaction and not disoblige the justice of the Quorum  The hour of nine was come this morning and I had no sooner set chairs by the steward's letter and fixed my teaequipage but I heard a knock at my door which was opened but no one entered after which followed a long silence which was broke at last by Sir I beg your pardon I think I know better and another voice Nay good Sir GilesI looked out from my window and saw the good company all with their hats off and arms spread offering the door to each other After many offers they entered with much solemnity in the order Mr Thrifty was so kind as to name them to me But they are now got to my chamberdoor and I saw my old friend Sir Harry enter I met him with all the respect due to so reverend a vegetable for you are to know that is my sense of a person who remains idle in the same place for half a century I got him with great success into his chair by the fire without throwing down any of my cups The knight bachelor told me he had a great respect for my whole family and would with my leave place himself next to Sir Harry at whose right hand he had sat at every quartersessions this thirty years unless he was sick The steward in the rear whispered the young templer that is true to my knowlege I had the misfortune as they stood cheek by jole to desire the 'squire to sit down before the justice of the Quorum to the no small satisfaction of the former and resentment of the latter but I saw my error too late and got them as soon as I could into their seats Well said I gentlemen after I have told you how glad I am of this great honour I am to desire you to drink a dish of tea They answered one and all that they never drank tea in a morning Not in a morning said I staring round me Upon which the pert jackanapes Nick Doubt tipped me the wink and put out his tongue at his grandfather Here followed a profound silence when the steward in his boots and  whip proposed we should adjourn to some publichouse where every body might call for what they pleased and enter upon the business We all stood up in an instant and Sir Harry filed off from the left very discreetly countermarching behind the chairs towards the door after him Sir Giles in the same manner The simple 'squire made a sudden start to follow but the justice of the Quorum whipped between upon the stand of the stairs A maid going up with coals made us halt and put us into such confusion that we stood all in a heap without any visible possiblity of recovering our order for the young jackanapes seemed to make a jest of this matter and had so contrived by pressing amongst us under pretence of making way that his grandfather was got into the middle and he knew nobody was of quality to stir a step till Sir Harry moved first We were fixed in this perplexity for some time till we heard a very loud noise in the street and Sir Harry asking what it was I to make them move said it was fire Upon this all ran down as fast as they could without order or ceremony till we got into the street where we drew up in very good order and filed off down SheerLane the impertinent templer driving us before him as in a string and pointing to his acquaintance who passed by  I must confess I love to use people according to their own sense of good breeding and therefore whipped in between the justice and the simple 'squire He could not properly take this ill but I overheard him whisper the steward that he thought it hard that a common conjurer should take place of him though an elder 'squire In this order we marched down Sheerlane at the upper end of which I lodge When we came to TempleBar Sir Harry and Sir Giles got over but a run of coaches kept the rest of us on this side the street however we all at last landed and drew up in very good order before Ben Tooke's shop who favoured our rallying with great humanity From hence we proceeded again till  we came to Dick's coffeehouse where I designed to carry them Here we were at our old difficulty and took up the street upon the same ceremony We proceeded through the entry and were so necessarily kept in order by the situation that we were now got into the coffeehouse itself where as soon as we arrived we repeated our civilities to each other after which we marched up to the high table which has an ascent to it inclosed in the middle of the room The whole house was alarmed at this entry made up of persons of so much state and rusticity Sir Harry called for a mug of ale and Dyer's letter The boy brought the ale in an instant but said they did not take in the letter No says Sir Harry then take back your mug we are like indeed to have good liquor at this house Here the templer tipped me a second wink and if I had not looked very grave upon him I found he was disposed to be very familiar with me In short I observed after a long pause that the gentlemen did not care to enter upon business till after their morningdraught for which reason I called for a bottle of mum and finding that had no effect upon them I ordered a second and a third after which Sir Harry reached over to me and told me in a low voice that the place was too public for business but he would call upon me again to morrowmorning at my own lodgings and bring some more friends with him  Sir  Richard Steele  assisted in this paper  No Tuesday November  From my own apartment  October  I was this morning awaked by a sudden shake of the house and as soon as I had got a little out of my  consternation I felt another which was followed by two or three repetitions of the same convulsion I got up as fast as possible girt on my rapier and snatched up my hat when my landlady came up to me and told me that the gentlewoman of the next house begged me to step thither for that a lodger she had taken in was run mad and she desired my advice as indeed every body in the whole lane does upon important occasions I am not like some artists saucy because I can be beneficial but went immediately Our neighbour told us she had the day before let her second floor to a very genteel youngish man who told her he kept extraordinary good hours and was generally at home most part of the morning and evening at study but that this morning he had for an hour together made this extravagant noise which we then heard I went up stairs with my hand upon the hilt of my rapier and approached this new lodger's door I looked in at the keyhole and there I saw a wellmade man look with great attention on a book and on a sudden jump into the air so high that his head almost touched the cieling He came down safe on his right foot and again flew up alighting on his left then looked again at his book and holding out his right leg put it into such a quivering motion that I thought he would have shaked it off He used the left after the same manner when on a sudden to my great surprize he stooped himself incredibly low and turned gently on his toes After this circular motion he continued bent in that humble posture for some time looking on his book After this he recovered himself with a sudden spring and flew round the room in all the violence and disorder imaginable till he made a full pause for want of breath In this interim my woman asked what I thought I whispered that I thought this learned person an enthusiast who possibly had his first education in the Peripatetic way which was a sect of philosophers who always studied when walking But observing him much out of breath I thought it the best  time to master him if he were disordered and knocked at his door I was surprized to find him open it and say with great civility and good mien that he hoped he had not disturbed us I believed him in a lucid interval and desired he would please to let me see his book He did so smiling I could not make any thing of it and therefore asked in what language it was writ He said it was one he studied with great application but it was his profession to teach it and could not communicate his knowlege without a consideration I answered that I hoped he would hereafter keep his thoughts to himself for his meditation this morming had cost me three coffee dishes and a clean pipe He seemed concerned at that and told me he was a dancingmaster and had been reading a dance or two before he went out which had been written by one who taught at an academy in France He observed me at a stand and went on to inform me that now articulate motions as well as founds were expressed by proper characters and that there is nothing so common as to communicate a dance by a letter I beseeched him hereafter to meditate in a groundroom for that otherwise it would be impossible for an artist of any other kind to live near him and that I was sure several of his thoughts this morning would have shaken my spectacles off my nose had I been myself at study  I then took my leave of this virtuoso and returned to my chamber meditating on the various occupations of rational creatures  No Saturday November  Amoto quaeramus seria ludo  HOR  The joining of pleasure and pain together in such devices seems to me the only pointed thought I  ever read which is natural and it must have proceeded from its being the universal sense and experience of mankind that they have all spoken of it in the same manner I have in my own reading remarked an hundred and three epigrams fifty odes and ninety one sentences tending to this sole purpose  It is certain there is no other passion which does produce such contrary effects in so great a degree but this may he said for love that if you strike it out of the soul life would be insipid and our being but half animated Human nature would sink into deadness and lethargy if not quickened with some active principle and as for all others whether ambition envy or avarice which are apt to possess the mind in the absence of this passion it must be allowed that they have greater pains without the compensation of such exquisite pleasures as those we find in love The great skill is to heighen the satisfactions and deaden the sorrows of it which has been the end of many of my labours and shall continue to be so for the service of the world in general and in particular of the fair sex who are always the best or the worst part of it It is pity that a passion which has in it a capacity of making life happy should not be cultivated to the utmost advantage Reason prudence and goodnature rightly applied can thoroughly accomplish this great end provided they have always a real and constant love to work upon But this subject I shall treat more at large in the history of my married sister and in the mean time shall conclude my reflection on the pains and pleasures which attend this passion with one of the finest allegories which I think I have ever read It is invented by the divine Plato and to show the opinion he himself had of it ascribed by him to his admired Socrates whom he represents as discoursing with his friends and giving the history of Love in the following manner  At the birth of Beauty says he there was a great feast made and many guests invited among the rest was the god Plenty who was the son of the goddess Prudence  and inherited many of his mother's virtues After a full entertainment he retired into the garden of Jupiter which was hung with a great variety of ambrosial fruits and seems to have been a very proper retreat for such a guest In the mean time an unhappy female called Poverty having heard of this great feast repaired to it in hopes of finding relief The first place she lights upon was Jupiter's garden which generally stands open to people of all conditions Poverty enters and by chance finds the god Plenty asleep in it She was immediately fired with his charms laid herself down by his side and managed matters so well that she conceived a child by him The world was very much in suspence upon the occasion and could not imagine to themselves what would be the nature of an infant that was to have its original from two such parents At the last the child appears and who should it be but Love This infant grew up and proved in all his behaviour what he really was a compound of opposite beings As he is the son of Plenty who was the offspring of Prudence he is subtle intriguing full of stratagems and devices as the son of Poverty he is fawning begging serenading delighting to lie at a threshold or beneath a window By the father he is audacious full of hopes conscious of merit and therefore quick of resentment by the mother he is doubtful timorous meanspirited fearful of offending and abject in submissions In the same hour you may see him transported with raptures talking of immortal pleasures and appearing satisfied as a god and immediately after as the mortal mother prevails in his composition you hehold him pining languishing despairing dying  I have been always wonderfully delighted with fables allegories and the like inventions which the politest and the best instuctors of mankind have always made use of they take off from the severity of instruction and inforce it at the same time that they conceal it the supposing Love to be conceived immediately after the birth of Beauty the parentage of Plenty and the inconsistency  of this passion with itself so naturally derived to it are great masterstrokes in this fable and if they fell into good hands might furnish out a more pleasing canto than any in Spenser  N  o  Saturday Nov  Dear Sir  I BELIEVE this is the first letter that was ever sent you from the middle region where I am at this present writing Not to keep you in suspence it comes to you from the top of the highest mountain in Switzerland where I am now shivering among the eternal frosts and snows I can scarce forbear dating it in December though they call it the first of August at the bottom of the mountain I assure you I can hardly keep my ink from freezing in the middle of the dogdays I am here entertained with the prettiest variety of snowprospects that you can imagine and have several pits of it before me that are very near as old as the mountain itself for in this country it is as lasting as marble I am now upon a spot of it which they tell me fell about the reign of Charlemain or king Pepin The inhabitants of the country are as great curiosities as the country itself they generally hire themselves out in their youth and if they are musquetproof till about fifty they bring home the money they have got and the limbs they have left to pass the rest of their time among their native mountains One of the gentlemen of the place who is come off with the loss of an eye only told me by way of boast that there were now seven wooden legs in his family and that for these four generations there had not been one in his line that carried a whole body with him to the grave I believe you will think the stile of this letter a little extraordinary but the Rehearsal will tell you that  people in clouds must not be confined to speak sense  and I hope  we that are above them may claim the same privilege Whereever I am I shall always be  SIR  Your most obedient Most humble servant  From my own apartment  November  I had several hints and advertisements from unknown hands that some who are enemies to my labours design to demand the fashionable way of satisfaction for the disturbance my lucubrations have given them I confess as things now stand I do not know how to deny such inviters and am preparing myself accordingly I have bought pumps and files and am every morning practising in my chamber My neighbour the dancingmaster has demanded of me why I take this liberty since I would not allow it him But I answered His was an act of an indifferent nature and mine of necessity My late treatises against duels have so far disobliged the fraternity of the noble science of defence that I can get none of them to show me so much as one pass I am therefore obliged to learn by book and have accordingly several volumes wherein all the postures are exactly delineated I must confess I am shy of letting people see me at this exercise because of my flannel waistcoat and my spectacles which I am forced to fix on the better to observe the posture of the enemy  I have upon my chamberwalls drawn at full length the figures of all sorts of men from eight foot to three foot two inches Within this height I take it that all the fighting men of Great Britain are comprehended But as I push I make allowances for my being of a lank and spare body and have chalked out in every figure my own dimensions for I scorn to rob any man of his life or to take  advantage of his breadth therefore I press purely in a line down from his nose and take no more of him to assault than he has of me for to speak impartially if a lean fellow wounds a fat one in any part to the right or left whether it be in carte or in tierce beyond the dimensions of the said lean fellow's own breadth I take it to be murder and such a murder as is below a gentleman to commit As I am spare I am also very tall and behave myself with relation to that advantage with the same punctilio and I am ready to stoop or stand according to the stature of my adversary I must confess I have had great success this morning and have hit every figure round the room in a mortal part without receiving the least hurt except a little scratch by falling on my face in pushing at one at the lower end of my chamber but I recovered so quick and jumped so nimbly into my guard that if he had been alive he could not have hurt me It is confessed I have writ against duels with some warmth but in all my discourses I have not ever said that I knew how a gentleman could avoid a duel if he were provoked to it and since that custom is now become a law I know nothing but the legislative power with new animadversions upon it can put us in a capacity of denying challenges though we are afterwards hanged for it But no more of this at present As things stand I shall put up no more affronts and I shall be so far from taking ill words that I will not take ill looks I therefore warn all young hot fellows not to look hereafter more terrible than their neighbours for if they stare at me with their hats cocked higher than other people I will not bear it Nay I give warning to all people in general to look kindly at me for I will bear no frowns even from ladies and if any woman pretends to look scornfully at me I shall demand satisfaction of the next of kin of the masculine gender  Sir Richard Steele assisted in this paper  N  o  Tuesday November  Illud maxime rarum genus est corum qui aut excellente ingenii magnitudine aut praeclara eruditione atque doctrina aut utraque re ornati spatium diliberandi habuerunt quem potissimum vitae cursum sequi vellent  Tull Offic  From my own apartment  November  HAVING swept away prodigious multitudes in one of my late papers and brought a great destruction upon my own species I must endeavour in this to raise fresh recruits and if possible to supply the places of the unborn and the deceased It is said of Xerxes that when he stood upon a hill and saw the whole country round him covered with his army he brust out in tears to think that not one of that multitude would be alive a hundred years after For my part when I take a survey of this populous city I can scarce forbear weeping to see how few of its inhabitants are now living It was with this thought that I drew up my last bill of mortality and endeavoured to set out in it the great number of persons who have perished by a distemper commonly known by the name of idleness which has long raged in the world and destroys more in every great town than the plague has done at Dantzick To repair the mischief it has done and stock the world with a better race of mortals I have more hopes of bringing to life those that are young than of reviving those that are old For which reason I shall here set down that noble allegory which was written by an old author called Prodicus but recommended and embellished by Socrates It is the description of Virtue and Pleasure making their court to Hercules under the appearances of two beautiful women  When Hercules says the divine moralist was in that part of his youth in which it was natural for him to consider what course of life he ought to pursue he one day  retired into a desart where the silence and solitude of the place very much favoured his meditations As he was musing on his present condition and very much perplexed in himself on the state of life he should chuse he saw two women of a larger stature than ordinary approaching towards him One of them had a very noble air and graceful deportment her beauty was natural and easy her person clean and unspotted her eyes cast towards the ground with an agreeable reserve her motion and behaviour full of modesty and her raiment as white as snow The other had a great deal of health and floridness in her countenance which she had helped with an artificial white and red and endeavoured to appear more graceful than ordinary in her mein by a mixture of affectation in all her gestures She had a wonderful confidence and assurance in her looks and all the variety of colours in her dress that she thought were the most proper to show her complexion to an advantage She cast her eyes upon herself then turned them on those that were present to see how they liked her and often looked on the figure she made in her own shadow Upon her nearer approach to Hercules she stepped before the other lady who came forward with a regular composed carriage and running up to him accosted him after the following manner  My dear Hercules says she I find you are very much divided in your own thoughts upon the way of life that you ought to chuse be my friend and follow me I will lead you into the possession of pleasure and out of the reach of pain and remove you from all the noise and disquietude of business The affairs of either war or peace shall have no power to disturb you Your whole employment shall be to make your life easy and to entertain every sense with its proper gratification Sumptuous tables beds of roses clouds of perfumes concerts of music crouds of beauties are all in a readiness to receive you Come along with me into this region of delights this world of pleasure and bid farewel for ever to care to pain to business  Hercules hearing the lady talk after this manner desired to know her name to which she answered my friends and those who are well acquainted with me call me Happiness but my enemies and those who would injure my reputation have given me the name of Pleasure  By this time the other lady was come up who addressed herself to the young hero in a very different manner  Hercules says she I offer myself to you because I know you are descended from the gods and give proofs of that descent by your love to virtue and application to the studies proper for your age This makes me hope you will gain both for yourself and me an immortal reputation But before I invite you into my society and friendship I will be open and sincere with you and must lay down this as an established truth that there is nothing truly valuable which can be purchased without pains and labour The gods have set a price upon every real and noble pleasure If you would gain the favour of the deity you must be at the pains of worshipping him if the friendship of good men you must study to oblige them if you would be honoured by your country you must take care to serve it In short if you would be eminent in war or peace you must become master of all the qualifications that can make you so These are the only terms and conditions upon which I can propose happiness  The goddess of Pleasure here broke in upon her discourse you see said she Hercules by her own confession the way to her pleasure is long and difficult whereas that which I propose is short and easy  Alas said the other lady whose visage glowed with a passion made up of scorn and pity what are the pleasures you propose To eat before you are hungry drink before you are athirst sleep before you are tired to gratify appetites before they are raised and raise such appetites as nature never planted You never heard the most delicious  music which is the praise of one's self nor saw the most beautiful object which is the work of one's own hands Your votaries pass away their youth in a dream of mistaken pleasures while they are hoarding up anguish torment and remorse for oldage As for me I am the friend of gods and of good men an agreeable companion to the artizan an houshold guardian to the fathers of families a patron and protector of servants and associate in all true and generous friendships The banquets of my votaries are never costly but always delicious for none eat or drink at them who are not invited by hunger and thirst Their slumbers are sound and their wakings chearful My young men have the pleasure of hearing themselves praised by those who are in years and those who are in years of being honoured by those who are young In a word my followers are favoured by the gods beloved by their acquaintance esteemed by their country and after the close of their labours honoured by posterity  We know by the life of this memorable hero to which of these two ladies he gave up his heart and I believe every one who reads this will do him the justice to approve his choice  I very much admire the speeches of these ladies as containing in them the chief arguments for a life of virtue or a life of pleasure that could enter into the thoughts of an heathen but am particularly pleased with the different figures he gives the two goddesses Our modern authors have represented Pleasure or Vice with an alluring face but ending in snakes and monsters here she appears in all the charms of beauty though they are all false and borrowed and by that means composes a vision entirely natural and pleasing  I have translated this allegory for the benefit of the youth of Great Britain and particularly of those who are still in the deplorable state of nonexistence and whom I most earnestly intreat to come into the world Let my embrios show the least inclination to any single virtue  and I shall allow it to be a struggling towards birth I do not expect of them that like the hero in the foregoing story they should go about as soon as they are born with a club in their hands and a lion's skin on their shoulders to root out monsters and destroy tyrants but as the finest author of all antiquity has said upon this very occasion though a man has not the abilities to distinguish himself in the most shining parts of a great character he has certainly the capacity of being just faithful modest and temperate  N  o  Tuesday November  Jam redit et Virgo redeunt Saturnia regna  Virg  SheerLane  November  I WAS last week taking a solitary walk in the garden of LincolnsInn a favour that is indulged me by several of the benchers who are my intimate friends and grown old with me in this neighbourhood when according to the nature of men in years who have made but little progress in the advancement of their fortune or their fame I was repining at the sudden rise many persons who are my juniors and indeed at the unequal distribution of wealth honour and all other blessings of life I was lost in this thought when the night came upon me and drew my mind into a far more agreeable contemplation The heaven above me appeared in all its glories and presented me with such an hemisphere of stars as made the most agreeable prospect imaginable to one who delights in the study of nature It happened to be a freezing night which had purified the whole body of air into such a bright transparent aether as made every constellation visible and at the same time gave such a particular glowing to the stars that I thought it the richest sky I had ever seen I could not behold a scene so wonderfully adorned and lighted up if I may be allowed that expression without  suitable meditations on the author of such illustrious and amazing objects For on these occasions philosophy suggests motives to religion and religion adds pleasures to philosophy  As soon as I had recovered my usual temper and serenity of soul I retired to my lodgings with the satisfaction of having passed away a few hours in the proper employments of a reasonable creature and promising myself that my slumbers would be sweet I no sooner fell into them but I dreamed a dream or saw a vision for I know not which to call it that seemed to rise out of my eveningmeditation and had something in it so solemn and serious that I cannot forbear communicating it though I must confess the wildness of imagination which in a dream is always loose and irregular discovers itself too much in several parts of it  Methoughts I saw the azure sky diversified with the same glorious luminaries which had entertained me a little before I fell asleep I was looking very attentively on that sign in the heavens which is called by the name of the Balance when on a sudden there appeared in it an extraordinary light as if the sun should rise at midnight By its increasing in breadth and lustre I soon found that it approached towards the earth and at length could discern something like a shadow hovering in the midst of a great glory which in a little time after I distinctly perceived to be the figure of a woman I fancied at first it might have been the angel or intelligence that guided the constellation from which it descended but upon a nearer view I saw about her all the emblems with which the goddess of Justice is usually described Her countenance was unspeakably awful and majestic but exquisitely beautiful to those whose eyes were strong enough to behold it her smiles transported with rapture her frowns terrified to despair She held in her hand a mirror endued with the same qualities as that which the painters put into the hand of Truth  There streamed from it a light which distinguished itself  from all the splendors that surrounded her more than a flash of lightning shines in the midst of daylight As she moved it in her hand it brightened the heavens the air or the earth When she had descended so low as to be seen and heard by mortals to make the pomp of her appearance more supportable she threw darkness and clouds about her that tempered the light into a thousand beautiful shades and colours and multiplied that lustre which was before too strong and dazling into a variety of milder glories  In the mean time the world was in an alarm and all the inhabitants of it gathered together upon a spacious plain so that I seemed to have all the species before my eyes A voice was heard from the clouds declaring the intention of this visit which was to restore and appropriate to every one living what was his due The fear and hope joy and sorrow which appeared in that great assembly after this solemn declaration are not to be expressed The first edict was then pronounced  That all titles and claims to riches and estates or to any part of them should be immediately vested in the rightful owner  Upon this the inhabitants of the earth held up the instruments of their tenure whether in parchment paper wax or any other form of conveyance and as the goddess moved the mirror of Truth which she held in her hand so that the light which flowed from it fell upon the multitude they examined the several instruments by the beams of it The rays of this mirror had a particular quality of setting fire to all forgery and falshood The blaze of papers the melting of seals and crackling of parchments made a very odd scene The fire very often ran through two or three lines only and then stopped though I could not but observe that the flame chiefly broke out among the interlineations and codicils The light of the mirror as it was turned up and down pierced into all the dark corners and recesses of the universe and by that means detected many writings and records which had been hidden or buried by time chance or design This occasioned  a wonderful revolution among the people At the same time the spoils of extortion fraud and robbery with all the fruits of bribery and corruption were thrown together into a prodigious pile that almost reached to the clouds and was called the Mount of Restitution to which all injured persons were invited to receive what belonged to them  One might see crouds of people in tattered garments come up and change clothes with others that were dressed with lace and embroidery Several who were Plumbs or very near it became men of moderate fortunes and many others who were overgrown in wealth and possessions had no more lest than what they usually spent What moved my concern most was to see a certain street of the greatest credit in Europe from one end to the other become bankrupt  The next command was for the whole body of mankind to separate themselves into their proper families which was no sooner done but an edict was issued out requiring all children  to repair to their true and natural fathers  This put a great part of the assembly in motion for as the mirror was moved over them it inspired every one with such a natural instinct as directed them to their real parents It was a very melancholy spectacle to see the fathers of very large families become childless and bachelors undone by a charge of sons and daughters You might see a presumptive heir of a great estate ask blessing of his coachman and a celebrated toast paying her duty to a valet de chambre Many under vows of celibacy appeared sorrounded with a numerous issue This change of parentage would have caused great lamentation but that the calamity was pretty common and that generally those who lost their children had the satisfaction of sceing them put into the hands of their dearest friends Men were no sooner settled in their right to their possessions and their progeny but there was a third order proclaimed  That all the posts of dignity and honour in the universe should be conferred on persons of the greatest  merit abilities and perfection  The handsome the strong and the wealthy immediately pressed forward but not being able to bear the splendor of the mirror which played upon their faces they immediately fell back among the croud but as the goddess tried the multitude by her glass as the eagle does its young ones by the lustre of the sun it was remarkable that every one turned away his face from it who had not distinguished himself either by virtue knowlege or capacity in business either military or civil This select assembly was drawn up in the centre of a prodigious multitude which was diffused on all sides and stood observing them as idle people use to gather about a regiment that are exercising their arms They were drawn up in three bodies in the first were the men of virtue in the second men of knowlege and in the third the men of business It was impossible to look at the first column without a secret veneration their aspects were so sweetened with humanity raised with contemplation emboldened with resolution and adorned with the most agreeable airs which are those that proceed from secret habits of virtue I could not but take notice that there were many faces among them which were unknown not only to the multitude but even to several of their own body  In the second column consisting of the men of knowlege there had been great disputes before they fell into the ranks which they did not do at last without positive command of the goddess who presided over the assembly She had so ordered it that men of the greatest genius and strongest sense were placed at the head of the column behind these were such as had formed their minds very much on the thoughts and writings of others In the rear of the column were men who had more wit than sense or more learning than understanding All living authors of any value were ranged in one of these classes but I must confess I was very much surprised to see a great body of editors critics commentators and grammarians meet with so very ill a reception They  had formed themselves into a body and with a great deal of arrogance demanded the first station in the column of knowlege but the goddess instead of complying with their request clapped them all into liveries and bid them know themselves for no other but lacqueys of the learned  The third column were men of business and consisting of persons in military and civil capacities The former marched out from the rest and placed themselves in the front at which the others shook their heads at them but did not think fit to dispute the post with them I could not but make several obsevations upon this last column of people but I have certain private reasons why I do not think fit to communicate them to the public In order to fill up all the posts of honour dignity and profit there was a draught made out of each column of men who were masters of all three qualifications in some degree and were preferred to stations of the first rank The second draught was made out of such as were possessed of any two of the qualifications who were disposed of in stations of a second dignity Those who were left and were endued only with one of them had their suitable posts When this was over there remained many places of trust and profit unfilled for which there were fresh draughts made out of the surrounding multitude who had any appearance of these excellencies or were recommended by those who possessed them in reality  All were surprised to see so many new faces in the most eminent dignities and for my own part I was very well pleased to see that all my friends either kept their present posts or were advanced to higher  Having filled my paper with those particulars of mankind I must reserve for another occasion the sequel of it which relates to the fair sex  N  o  Thursday December  Postquam fregit subsellia versu  Esurit intectam Paridi nisi vendit Agaven  Juv  From my own apartment  November  THE progress of my intended account of what happened when Justice visited mortals is at present interrupted by the observation and sense of an injustice against which there is no remedy even in a kingdom more happy in the care taken of the liberty and property of the subject than any other nation upon earth This iniquity is committed by a most impregnable set of mortals men who are rogues within the law and in the very commission of what they are guilty of professedly own that they forbear no injury but from the terror of being punished for it These miscreants are a set of wretches we authors call pirates who print any book poem or sermon as soon as it appears in the world in a smaller volume and sell it as all other thieves do stolen goods at a cheaper rate I was in my rage calling them rascals plunderers robbers highwaymenBut they acknowlege all that and are pleased with those as well as any other titles nay will print them themselves to turn the peny  I am extremely at a loss how to act against such open enemies who have not shame enough to be touched with our reproaches and are as well defended against what we can say as what we can do Railing therefore we must turn into complaint which I cannot forbear making when I consider that all the labours of my long life may be disappointed by the first man that pleases to rob me I had flattered myself that my stock of learning was worth l per annum which would very handsomely maintain me and my little family who are so happy or so wise as to want only necessaries Before men had come up  to this barefaced impudence it was an estate to have a competency of understanding  An ingenious drole who is since dead and indeed it is well for him he is so for he must have starved had he lived to this day used to give me an account of his good husbandry in the management of his learning He was a general dealer and had his amusements as well comical as serious The merry rogue said when he wanted a dinner he writ a paragraph of tabletalk and his bookseller upon sight paid the reckoning He was a very good judge of what would please the people and could aptly hit both the genius of his readers and the season of the year in his writings His brain which was his estate had as regular and different produce as other mens land From the beginning of November till the opening of the campagne he writ pamphlets and letters to members of parliament or friends in the country but sometimes he would relieve his ordinary readers with a murder and lived comfortably a week or two upon strange and lamentable accidents A little before the armies took the field his way was to open your attention with a prodigy and a monster well writ was two guineas the lowest price This prepared his readers for his great and bloody news from Flanders in June and July Poor Tom He is goneBut I observed he always looked well after a battle and was apparently fatter in a fighting year Had this honest careless fellow lived till now famine had stared him in the face and interrupted his merriment as it must be a solid affliction to all those whose pen is their portion  As for my part I do not speak wholly for my own sake in this point for palmistry and astrology will bring me in greater gains than these my papers so that I am only in the condition of a lawyer who leaves the bar for chamberpractice However I may be allowed to speak in the cause of learning itself and lament that a liberal education is the only one which a polite nation makes unprofitable All mechanic artizans are allowed  to reap the fruit of their invention and ingenuity without invasion but he that has separated himself from the rest of mankind and studied the wonders of the creation the government of his passions and the revolutions of the world and has an ambition to communicate the effect of half his life spent in such noble enquiries has no property in what he is willing to produce but is exposed to robbery and want with this melancholy and just reflection that he is the only man who is not protected by his country at the same time that he best deserves it  According to the ordinary rules of computation the greater the adventure is the greater ought to be the profit of those who succeed in it and by this measure none have pretence of turning their labours to greater advantage than persons brought up to letters A learned education passing through great schools and universities is very expensive and consumes a moderate fortune before it is gone through in its proper forms The purchase of an handsome commission or employment which would give a man a good figure in another kind of life is to be made at a much cheaper rate Now if we consider this expensive voyage which is undertaken in the search of knowlege and how few there are who take in any considerable merchandise how less frequent it is to be able to turn what men have gained into profit how hard is it that the very small number who are distinguished with abilities to know how to vend their wares and have the good fortune to bring them into port should suffer being plundered by privateers under the very cannon that should protect them The most eminent and useful author of the age we live in after having laid out a princely revenue in works of charity and beneficence as became the greatness of his mind and the sanctity of his character would have left the person in the world who was the dearest to him in a narrow condition had not the sale of his immortal writings brought her in a very considerable dowry though it was impossible for it to be equal to their value Every one will know that I here mean the  works of the late archbishop of Canterbury the copy of which was sold for l  I do not speak with relation to any party but it has happened and may often so happen that men of great learning and virtue cannot qualify themselves for being employed in business or receiving preferments In this case you cut them off from all support if you take from them the benefit that may arise from their writings For my own part I have brought myself to consider things in so unprejudiced a manner that I esteem more a man who can live by the product of his understanding than one who does it by the favour of great men  The zeal of an author has transported me thus far though I think my self as much concerned in the capacity of a reader If this practice goes on we must never expect to see again a beautiful edition of a book in Great Britain  We have already seen the memoirs of Sir William Temple published in the same character and volume with the history of Tom Thumb and the works of our greatest poets shrunk into peny books and garlands For my own part I expect to see my lucubrations printed on browner paper then they are at present and if the humour continues must be forced to retrench my expensive way of living and not smoke above two pipes a day  Sir Richard Steele joined in this paper  N  o  Saturday December  From my own apartment  December  A continuation of the Vision  THE male world were dismissed by the goddess of Justice and disappeared when on a sudden the whole plain was covered with women So charming a multitude filled my heart with unspeakable pleasure and  as the celestial light of the mirror shone upon their faces several of them seemed rather persons that descended in the train of the goddess than such who were brought before her to their trial The clack of tongues and confusion of voices in this new assembly was so very great that the goddess was forced to command silence several times and with some severity before she could make them attentive to her edicts They were all sensible that the most important affair among womankind was then to be settled which every one knows to be the point of place This had raised innumerable disputes among them and put the whole sex into a tumult Every one produced her claim and pleaded her pretensions Birth beauty wit or wealth were words that rung in my ears from all parts of the plain Some boasted of the merit of their husbands others of their own power in governing them Some pleaded their unspotted virginity others their numerous issue Some valued themselves as they were the mothers and others as they were the daughters of considerable persons There was not a single accomplishment unmentioned or unpractised The whole congregation was full of singing dancing tossing ogling squeaking smiling sighing fanning frowning and all those irresistible arts which women put in practice to captivate the hearts of reasonable creatures The goddess to end this dispute caused it to be proclaimed  That every one should take place according as she was more or less beautiful  This declaration gave great satisfaction to the whole assembly which immediately bridled up and appeared in all its beauties Such as believed themselves graceful in their motion found an occasion of falling back advancing forward or making a false step that they might show their persons in the most becoming air Such as had fine necks and bosoms were wonderfully curious to look over the heads of the multitude and observe the most distant parts of the assembly Several clapped their hands on their forheads as helping their sight to look upon the glories that surrounded the goddess but in reality to show  fine hands and arms The ladies were yet better pleased when they heard that in the decision of this great controversy each of them should be her own judge and take her place according to her own opinion of herself when she consulted her lookingglass  The goddess then let down the mirror of truth in a golden chain which appeared larger in proportion as it descended and approached nearer to the eyes of the beholders It was particular property of this lookingglass to banish all false appearances and show people what they are The whole woman was represented without regard to the usual external features which were made entirely conformable to their real characters In short the most accomplished taking in the whole circle of female perfections were the most beautiful and the most defective the most deformed The goddess so varied the motion of the glass and placed it in so many different lights that each had an opportunity of seeing herself in it  It is impossible to describe the rage the pleasure or astonishment that appeared in each face upon its representation in the mirror multitudes started at their own form and would have broke the glass if they could have reached it Many saw their blooming features wither as they looked upon them and their selfadmiration turned into a loathing and abhorrence The lady who was thought so agreeable in her anger and was so often celebrated for a woman of fire and spirit was frighted at her own image and fancied she saw a fury in the glass The interested mistress beheld a harpy and the subtle jilt a sphinx I was very much troubled in my own heart to see such a destruction of fine faces but at the same time had the pleasure of seeing several improved which I had before looked upon as the greatest masterpieces of nature I observed that some few were so humble as to be surprised at their own charms and that many a one who had lived in the retirement and severity of a vestal shined forth in all the graces and attractions of a syren I was ravished at the sight of a particular image in the mirror  which I think the most beautiful object that my eyes ever beheld There was something more than human in her countenance Her eyes were so full of light that they seemed to beautify every thing they looked upon Her face was enlivened with such a florid bloom as did not so properly seem the mark of health as of immortality Her shape her stature and her mein were such as distinguished her even there where the whole fair sex was assembled  I was impatient to see the lady represented by so divine an image whom I found to be the person that stood at my right hand and in the same point of view with myself This was a little old woman who in her prime had been about five foot high though at present shrunk to about three quarters of that measure Her natural aspect was puckered up with wrinkles and her head covered with grey hairs I had observed all along an innocent chearfulness in her face which was now heightened into rapture as she beheld herself in the glass It was an odd circumstance in my dream but I cannot forbear relating it I conceived so great an inclination towards her that I had thoughts of discoursing her upon the point of marriage when on a sudden she was carried from me for the word was now given that all who were pleased with their own images should separate and place themselves at the head of their sex  This detachment was afterwards divided into three bodies consisting of maids wives and widows the wives being placed in the middle with the maids on the right and the widows on the left though it was with difficulty that these two last bodies were hindered from falling into the centre This separation of those who liked their real selves not having lessened the number of the main body so considerably as it might have been wished the goddess after having drawn up her mirror thought fit to make new distinctions among those who did not like the figure which they saw in it She made several wholsome edicts which are slipt out of my mind but there were two  which dwelt upon me as being very extraordinary in their kind and executed with great severity Their design was to make an example of two extremes in the female world of those who are very severe on the conduct of others and of those who are very regardless of their own The first sentence therefore the goddess pronounced was  That all females addicted to consoriousness and detraction should lose the use of speech  a punishment which would be the most grievous to the offender and what should be the end of all punishments effectual for rooting out the crime Upon this edict which was as soon executed as published the noise of the assembly very considerably abated It was a melancholy spectacle to see so many who had the reputation of rigid virtue struck dumb A lady who stood by me and saw my concern told me she wondered how I could be concerned for such a pack ofI found by the shaking of her head she was going to give me their characters but by her saying no more I perceived she had lost the command of her tongue This calamity fell very heavy upon that part of women who are distinguished by the name of Prudes a courtly word for female hypocrites who have a short way to being virtuous by showing that others are vicious The second sentence was then pronounced against the loose part of the sex  That all should immediately be pregnant who in any part of their lives had ran the hazard of it  This produced a very goodly appearance and revealed so many misconducts that made those who were lately struck dumb repine more than ever at their want of utterance though at the same time as afflictions seldom come single many of the mutes were also seized with this new calamity The ladies were now in such a condition that they would have wanted room had not the plain been large enough to let them divide their ground and extend their lines on all sides It was a sensible affliction to me to see such a multitude of fair ones either dumb or bigbellied but I was something more at ease when I sound that they agreed upon several regulations  to cover such misfortunes Among others that it should be an established maxim in all nations that a woman's first child might come into the world within six months after her acquaintance with her husband and that grief might retard the birth of her last till fourteen months after his decease  This vision lasted till my usual hour of waking which I did with some surprize to find myself alone after having been engaged almost a whole night in so prodigious a multitude I could not but reflect with wonder at the partiality and extravagance of my vision which according to my thoughts has not done justice to the sex If virtue in men is more venerable it is in women more lovely which Milton has very finely expressed in his Paradise Lost where Adam speaking of Eve after having asserted his own preeminence as being first in creation and internal faculties breaks out into the following rapture  Yet when I approach  Her loveliness so absolute she seems  And in herself complete so well to know  Her own that what she wills to do or say  Seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best  All higher knowlege in her presence falls  Degraded Wisdom in discourse with her  Loses discountenanced and like folly shows  Authority and reason on her wait  As one intended first not after made  Occasionally and to consummate all  Greatness of mind and nobleness their seat  Build in her loveliest and create an awe  About her as a guard angelic plac'd  N  o  Tuesday December  Hae nugae seria ducunt  In mala derisum semel exceptumque sinistre  Hor  From my own apartment  December  THERE is nothing gives a man greater satisfaction than the sense of having dispatched a great deal of business especially when it turns to the public emolument I have much pleasure of this kind upon my spirits at present occasioned by the fatigue of affairs which I went through last Saturday It is some time since I set apart that day for examining the pretensions of several who had applied to me for canes perspectiveglasses snuffboxes orangeflowerwaters and the like ornaments of life In order to adjust this matter I had before directed Charles Lillie of Beausordbuildings to prepare a great bundle of blank licences in the following words  You are hereby required to permit the bearer of this cane to pass and repass through the streets and suburbs of London or any place within ten miles of it without left or molestation provided that he does not walk with it under his arm brandish it in the air or hang it on a button in which case it shall be forfeited and I hereby declare it forfeited to any one who shall think it safe to take it from him  Isaac Bickerstaffe  The same form differing only in the provisos will serve for a perspective snuffbox or perfumed handkerchief I had placed myself in my elbowchair at the upper end of my great parlour having ordered Charles Lillie to take his place upon a jointstool with a writingdesk before him John Morphew also took his station at the door I having for his good and faithful services appointed him my chamberkeeper upon courtdays He let me know that there were a great number attending without  Upon which I ordered him to give notice that I did not intend to sit upon snuffboxes that day but that those who appeared for canes might enter The first presented me with the following petition which I ordered Mr Lillie to read  To Isaac Bickerstaffe  Esq  Censor of GreatBritain The humble petition of Simon Trippit  Sheweth  That your petitioner having been bred up to a cane from his youth it is now become as necessary to him as any other of his limbs  That a great part of his behaviour depending upon it he should be reduced to the utmost necessities if he should lose the use of it  That the knocking of it upon his shoe leaning one leg upon it or whistling with it on his mouth are such great reliefs to him in conversation that he does not know how to be good company without it  That he is at present engaged in an amour and must despair of success if it be taken from him  Your petitioner therefore hopes that the premisses tenderly considered your worship will not deprive him of so useful and so necessary a support  And your petitioner shall ever  etc  Upon the hearing of his case I was touched with some compassion and the more so when upon observing him nearer I found he was a Prig I bid him produce his cane in court which he had left at the door He did so and I finding it to be very curiously clouded with a transparent amber head and a blue ribbon to hang upon his wrist I immediately ordered my clerk Lillie to lay it up and deliver out to him a plain joint headed with walnut and then in order to wean him from it by degrees permitted him to wear it three days in the week and to  abate proportionably till he found himself able to go alone  The second who appeared came limping into the court and setting forth in his petition many pretences for the use of a cane I caused them to be examined one by one but finding him in different stories and confronting him with several witnesses who had seen him walk upright I ordered Mr Lillie to take in his cane and rejected his petition as frivolous  A third made his entery with great difficulty leaning upon a slight stick and in danger of falling every step he took I saw the weakness of his hams and hearing that he had married a young wife about a fortnight before I bid him leave his cane and gave him a new pair of crutches with which he went off in great vigour and alacrity This gentleman was succeeded by another who seemed very much pleased while his petition was reading in which he had represented that he was extremely afflicted with the gout and set his foot upon the ground with the caution and dignity which accompany that distemper I suspected him for an impostor and having ordered him to be searched I committed him into the hands of Dr Thomas Smith in KingStreet my own corncutter who attended in an outward room and wrought so speedy a cure upon him that I thought fit to send him also away without his cane  While I was thus dispensing justice I heard a noise in my outward room and enquiring what was the occasion of it my doorkeeper told me that they had taken up one in the very fact as he was passing by my door They immediately brought in a lively freshcoloured young man who made great resistance with hand and foot but did not offer to make use of his cane which hung on his fifth button Upon examination I found him to be an Oxford scholar who was just entered at the Temple He at first disputed the jurisdiction of the court but being driven out of his little law and logic he told me very pertly that he looked upon such a perpendicular  creature as a man to make a very imperfect figure without a cane in his hand It is well known says he we ought according to the natural situation of our bodies to walk upon our hands and feet and that the wisdom of the ancients had described man to be an animal of four legs in the morning two at noon and three at night by which they intimated that a cane might very properly become part of us in some period of life Upon which I asked him whether he wore it at his breast to have it in readiness when that period should arrive My young lawyer immediately told me he had a property in it and a right to hang it where he pleased and to make use of it as he thought fit provided that he did not break the peace with it and further said that he never took it off his button unless it were to lift it up at a coachman hold it over the head of a drawer point out the circumstances of a story or for other services of the like nature that are all within the laws of the land I did not care for discouraging a young man who I saw would come to good and because his heart was set upon his new purchase I only ordered him to wear it about his neck instead of hanging it upon his button and so dismissed him  There were several appeared in court whose pretensions I found to be very good and therefore gave many their licences upon paying their fees as many others had their licences renewed who required more time for recovery of their lameness than I had before allowed them  Having dispatched this set of my petitioners there came in a well dressed man with a glasstube in one hand and his petition in the other Upon his entering the room he threw back the right side of his wig put forward his right leg and advancing the glass to his right eye aimed it directly at me In the mean while to make my observations also I put on my spectacles in which posture we surveyed each other for some time Upon the removal of our glasses I desired him to read his petition which he did very promptly and easily though at the  same time it set forth that he could see nothing distinctly and was within very few degrees of being utterly blind concluding with a prayer that he might be permitted to strengthen and extend his sight by a glass In answer to this I told him he might sometimes extend it to his own destruction As you are now said I you are out of the reach of beauty the snafts of the finest eyes lose their force before they can come at you you cannot distinguish a toast from an orangewench you can see a whole circle of beauty without any interruption from an impertinent face to discompose you In short what are snares for othersMy petitioner would hear no more but told me very seriously Mr Bickerstaffe you quite mistake your man it is the joy the pleasure the employment of my life to frequent public assemblies and gaze upon the fair In a word I found his use of a glass was occasioned by no other infirmity but his vanity and was not so much designed to make him see as to make him be seen and distinguished by others I therefore refused him a licence for a perspective but allowed him a pair of spectacles with full permission to use them in any public assembly as he should think fit He was followed by so very few of this order of men that I have reason to hope this sort of cheats are almost at an end  The orangeflowermen appeared next with petitions persumed so strongly with musk that I was almost overcome with the scent and for my own sake was obliged forthwith to license their handkerchiefs especially when I found they had sweetened them at Charles Lillie's and that some of their persons would not be altogether inoffensive without them John Morphew whom I have made general of my dead men acquainted me that the petitioners were all of that order and could produce certificates to prove it if I required it I was so well pleased with this way of their embalming themselves that I commanded the abovesaid Morphew to give it in orders to his whole army that every one who did not surrender himself up to be disposed of by the upholders should use the same  method to keep himself sweet during his present state of putrefaction  I finished my session with great content of mind reflecting upon the good I had done for however slightly men may regard these particularities and little follies in dress and behaviour they lead to greater evils The bearing to be laughed at for such singularities teaches us insensibly an impertinent fortitude and enables us to bear public censure for things which more substantially deserve it By this means they open a gate to folly and oftentimes render a man so ridiculous as discredit his virtues and capacities and unqualify them from doing any good in the world Besides the giving into uncommon habits of this nature is a want of that humble deference which is due to mankind and what is worst of all the certain indication of some secret flaw in the mind of the person that commits them When I was a young man I remember a gentleman of great integrity and worth was very remarkable for wearing a broad belt and a hanger instead of a fashonable sword though in all other points a very wellbred man I suspected him at first sight to have something wrong in him but was not able for a long while to discover any collateral proofs of it I watched him narrowly for six and thirty years when at last to the surprize of every body but myself who had long expected to see the folly break out he married his own cookmaid  Sir Richard Steele joined in this paper  N  o  Saturday December  Pronaque cum spectant animalia caetera terram  Os homini sublime dedit coelumque tueri  Jussit  Ovid Met  SheerLane  December  IT is not to be imagined how great an effect welldisposed lights with proper forms and orders in assemblies have upon some tempers I am sure I feel it in so extraordinary a manner that I cannot in a day or two get out of my imagination any very beautiful or disagreeable impression which I receive on such occasions For this reason I frequently look in at the playhouse in order to enlarge my thoughts and warm my mind with some new ideas that may be serviceable to me in my lucubrations  In this disposition I entered the theatre the other day and placed myself in a corner of it very convenient for seeing without being myself observed I found the audience hushed in a very deep attention and did not question but some noble tragedy was just then in its crisis or that an incident was to be unravelled which would determine the fate of an hero While I was in this suspence expecting every moment to see my friend Mr Betterton appear in all the majesty of distress to my unspeakable amazement there came up a monster with a face between his feet and as I was looking on he raised himself on one leg in such a perpendicular posture that the other grew in a direct line above his head It afterwards twisted itself into the motions and wreathings of several different animals and after great variety of shapes and transformations went off the stage in the figure of an human creature The admiration the applause the satisfaction of the audience during this strange entertainment is not to be expressed I was very much out of countenance for my dear countrymen and looked about with some apprehension for fear any foreigner should be present  Is it possible thought I that human nature can rejoice in its disgrace and take pleasure in seeing its own figure turned to ridicule and distorted into forms that raise horror and aversion There is something disingenuous and immoral in the being able to bear such a sight Men of elegant and noble minds are shocked at seeing the characters of persons who deserve esteem for virtue knowlege or services to their country placed in wrong lights and by misrepresentation made the subject of buffoonry Such a nice abhorrence is not indeed to be found among the vulgar but methinks it is wonderful that these who have nothing but the outward figure to distinguish them as men should delight in seeing it abused vilified and disgraced  I must confess there is nothing that more pleases me in all that I read in books or see among mankind than such passages as represent human nature in its proper dignity As man is a creature made up of different extremes he has something in him very great and very mean a skilful artist may draw an excellent picture of him in either view The finest authors of antiquity have taken him on the more advantagious side They cultivate the natural grandeur of the soul raise in her a generous ambition feed her with hopes of immortality and perfection and do all they can to widen the partition between the virtuous and the vicious by making the difference betwixt them as great as between gods and brutes In short it is impossible to read a page in Plato Tully and a thousand other ancient moralists without being a greater and a better man for it On the contrary I could never read any of our modish French authors or those of our own country who are the imitators and admirers of that trifling nation without being for some time out of humour with myself and at every thing about me Their business is to depreciate human nature and consider it under its worst appearances They give mean interpretations and base motives to the worthiest actions they resolve virtue and vice into constitution In short  they endeavour to make no distinction between man and man between the species of men and that of brutes As an instance of this kind of authors among many others let any one examine the celebrated Rochefoucault who is the great philosopher for administering of consolation to the idle the envious and worthless part of mankind  I remember a young gentleman of moderate understanding but great vivacity who by dipping into many authors of this nature had got a little smattering knowlege just enough to make an atheist or a freethinker but not a philosopher or a man of sense With these accomplishments he went to visit his father in the country who was a plain rough honest man and wise though not learned The son who took all opportunities to show his learning began to establish a new religion in the family and to enlarge the narrowness of their country notions in which he succeeded so well that he had seduced the butler by his tabletalk and staggered his eldest sister The old gentleman began to be alarmed at the schisms that arose among his children but did not yet believe his son's doctrine to be so pernicious as it really was till one day talking of his settingdog the son said he did not question but Trey was as immortal as any one of the family and in the heat of the argument told his father that for his own part he expected to die like a dog Upon which the old man starting up in a very great passion cried out then sirrah you shall live like one and taking his cane in his hand cudgelled him out of his system This had so good an effect upon him that he took up from that day fell to reading good books and is now a bencher in the MiddleTemple  I do not mention this cudgelling part of the story with a design to engage the secular arm in matters of this nature but certainly if it ever exerts itself in affairs of opinion and speculation it ought to do it on such shallow and despicable pretenders to knowlege who endeavour to give man dark and uncomfortable prospects of his being and destroy those principles which are the  support happiness and glory of all public societies as well as private persons  I think it is one of Pythagoras's golden sayings  That a man should take care above all things to have a due respect for himself  And it is certain that this licentious sort of authors who are for depreciating mankind endeavoured to disappoint and undo what the most refined spirits have been labouring to advance since the beginning of the world The very design of dress goodbreeding outward ornaments and ceremony were to list up human nature and to set it off to an advantage Architecture painting and statuary were invented with the same design as indeed every art and science contributes to the embellishment of life and to the wearing off or throwing into shades the mean and low parts of our nature Poetry carries on this great end more than all the rest as may be seen in the following passage taken out of Sir Francis Bacon's Advancement of Learning which gives a truer and better account of this art than all the volumes that were ever written upon it  'Poetry especially heroical seems to be raised altogether from a noble foundation which makes much for the dignity of man's nature For seeing this sensible world is in dignity inferior to the soul of man poesy seems to endue human nature with that which history denies and to give satisfaction to the mind with at least the shadow of things where the substance cannot be had For if the matter be throughly considered a strong argument may be drawn from poesy that a more stately greatness of things a more perfect order and a more beautiful variety delights the soul of man than any way can be found in nature since the fall Wherefore seeing the acts and events which are the subjects of true history are not of that amplitude as to content the mind of man poesy is ready at hand to feign acts more heroical Because true history reports the successes of business not proportionable to the merit of virtues and vices poesy corrects it and presents events and  fortunes according to desert and according to the law of providence because true history through the frequent satiety and similitude of things works a distaste and misprision in the mind of man poesy cheareth and refresheth the soul chanting things rare and various and full of vicissitudes So as poesy serveth and conferreth to delectation magnanimity and morality and therefore it may seem deservedly to have some participation of divineness because it doth raise the mind and exalt the spirit with high raptures by proportioning the shews of things to the desires of the mind and not submitting the mind to things as reason and history do And by these allurements and congruities whereby it cherisheth the soul of man joined also with concert of music whereby it may more sweetly insinuate itself it hath won such access that it hath been in estimation even in rude times and barbarous nations when other learning stood excluded'  But there is nothing which favours and falls in with this natural greatness and dignity of human nature so much as religion which does not only promise the entire refinement of the mind but the glorifying of the body and the immortality of both  N  o  Thursday December  Quae lucis miseris tam dira cupido  Virg  SheerLane  December  AS soon as I had placed myself in my chair of judicature I ordered my clerk Mr Lillie to read to the assembly who were gathered together according to notice a certain declaration by way of charge to open the purpose of my session which tended only to this explanation that as other courts were often called to demand the execution of persons dead in law so this was held to give the last orders relating to those who are dead in  reason The sollicitor of the new company of upholders near the HayMarket appeared in behalf of that useful society and brought in an accusation of a young woman who herself stood at the bar before me Mr Lillie read her indictment which was in substance that whereas Mrs Rebecca Pindust of the parish of St Martin in the Fields had by the use of one instrument called a lookingglass and by the further use of certain attire made either of cambric muslin or other linen wares upon her head attained to such an evil art and magical force in the motion of her eyes and turn of her countenance that she the said Rebecca had put to death several young men of the said parish and that the said young men had acknowleged in certain papers commonly called loveletters which were produced in court gilded on the edges and sealed with a particular wax with certain amorous and enchanting words wrought upon the said seals that they died for the said Rebecca and whereas the said Rebecca persisted in the said evil practice this way of life the said society construed to be according to former edicts a state of death and demanded an order for the interment of the said Rebecca  I looked upon the maid with great humanity and desired her to make answer to what was said against her She said it was indeed true that she had practised all the arts and means she could to dispose of herself happily in marriage but thought she did not come under the censure expressed in my writings for the same and humbly hoped I would not condemn her for the ignorance of her accusers who according to their own words had rather represented her killing than dead She further alleged that the expressions mentioned in the papers written to her were become mere words and that she had been always ready to marry any of those who said they died for her but that they made their escape as soon as they found themselves pitied or believed She ended her discourse by desiring I would for the future settle the meaning of the words  I die  in letters of love  Mrs Pindust behaved herself with such an air of innocence that she easily gained credit and was acquitted Upon which occasion I gave it as a standing rule that any persons who in any letter billet or discourse should tell a woman he died for her should if she pleased be obliged to live with her or be immediately interred upon such their own confession without bail or mainprize  It happened that the very next who was brought before me was one of her admirers who was indicted upon that very head A letter which he acknowleged to be his own hand was read in which were the following words  Cruel creature I die for you  It was observable that he took snuff all the time his accusation was reading I asked him how he came to use these words if he were not a dead man He told me he was in love with a lady and did not know any other way of telling her so and that all his acquaintance took the same method Though I was moved with compassion towards him by reason of the weakness of his parts yet for example's sake I was forced to answer your sentence shall be a warning to all the rest of your companions not to tell lies for want of wit Upon this he began to beat his snuffbox with a very saucy air and opening it again Faith Isaac said he thou art a very unaccountable old fellowPrithee who gave thee power of life and death Whatapox hast thou to do with ladies and lovers I suppose thou wouldst have a man be in company with his mistress and say nothing to her Dost thou call breaking a jest telling a lie Ha Is that thy wisdom old Stiffrump ha He was going on with this insipid commonplace mirth sometimes opening his box sometimes shutting it then viewing the picture on the lid and then the workmanship of the hinge when in the midst of his eloquence I ordered his box to be taken from him upon which he was immediately struck speechless and carried off stonedead  The next who appeared was a hale old fellow of sixty He was brought in by his relations who desired  leave to bury him Upon requiring a distinct account of the prisoner a credible witness deposed that he always rose at ten of the clock played with his cat till twelve smoaked tobacco till one was at dinner till two then took another pipe played at backgammon till six talked of one Madam Frances an old mistress of his till eight repeated the same account at the tavern till ten then returned home took the other pipe and then to bed I asked him what he had to say for himself As to what said he they mention concerning Madam Frances I did not care for hearing a Canterbury tale and therefore thought myself seasonably interrupted by a young gentleman who appeared in the behalf of the old man and prayed an arrest of judgment for that he the said young man held certain lands by his the said old man's life Upon this the sollicitor of the upholders took an occasion to demand him also and thereupon produced several evidences that witnessed to his life and conversation It appeared that each of them divided their hours in matters of equal moment and importance to themselves and to the public They rose at the same hour while the old man was playing with his cat the young one was looking out of his window while the old man was smoaking his pipe the young man was rubbing his teeth while one was at dinner the other was dressing while one was at backgammon the other was at dinner while the old fellow was talking of Madam Frances the young one was either at play or toasting women whom he never conversed with The only difference was that the young man had never been good for any thing the old man a man of worth before he knew Madam Frances Upon the whole I ordered them to be both interred together with inscriptions proper to their characters signifying that the old man died in the year and was buried in the year And over the young one it was said that he departed this world in the th year of his death  The next class of criminals were authors in prose and verse Those of them who had produced any stillborn  work were immediately dismissed to their burial and were followed by others who notwithstanding some sprightly issue in their lifetime had given proofs of their death by some posthumous children that bore no resemblance to their elder brethren As for those who were the fathers of a mixed progeny provided always they could prove the last to be a live child they escaped with life but not without loss of limbs for in this case I was satisfied with amputation of the parts which were mortified  These were followed by a great croud of superannuated benchers of the inns of court senior fellows of colleges and defunct statesmen all whom I ordered to be decimated indifferently allowing the rest a reprieve for one year with a promise of a free pardon in case of resuscitation  There were still great multitudes to be examined but finding it very late I adjourned the court not without the secret pleasure that I had done my duty and furnished out an handsome execution  Going out of the court I received a letter informing me that in pursuance of the edict of justice in one of my late visions all those of the fair sex began to appear pregnant who had ran any hazard of it as was manifest by a particular swelling in the petticoats of several ladies in and about this great city I must confess I do not attribute the rising of this part of the dress to this occasion yet must own that I am very much disposed to be offended with such a new and unaccountable fashion I shall however pronounce nothing upon it till I have examined all that can be said for and against it And in the mean time think fit to give this notice to the fair ladies who are now making up their wintersuits that they may abstain from all dresses of that kind till they shall find what judgment will be passed upon them for it would very much trouble me that they should put themselves to an unnecessary expence and I could not but think myself to blame if I should hereafter forbid them the wearing of such garments when they have laid out money upon  on them without having given them any previous admonitions  Sir Richard Steele joined in this paper  No Saturday December

ordinarily serious and as my attention was not drawn out among exterior objects by the avocations of sense my thoughts naturally fell upon myself I was considering amidst the stilness of the night what was the proper employment of a thinking being What were the perfections it should propose to itself And what the end it should aim at My mind is of such a particular cast that the falling of a shower of rain or the whistling of wind at such a time is apt to fill my thoughts with something awful and solemn I was in this disposition when our bellman began his midnight homily which he has been repeating to us every winter night for these twenty years with the usual exordium  Oh mortal man thou that art born in sin  Sentiments of this nature which are in themselves just and reasonable however debased by the circumstances that accompany them do not fail to produce their natural effect in a mind that is not perverted and depraved by wrong notions of gallantry politeness and ridicule  The temper which I now found myself in as well as the time of the year put me in mind of those lines in Shakespear wherein according to his agreeable wildness of imagination he has wrought a country tradition into a beautiful piece of poetry In the tragedy of Hamlet where the ghost vanishes upon the cock's crowing he takes occasion to mention its crowing all hours of the night about Christmas time and to insinuate a kind of religious veneration for that season  It faded on the crowing of the cock  Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes  Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated  The bird of dawning singeth all night long  And then say they no spirit dares walk abroad  The nights are wholsome then no planets strike  No fairy takes no witch has power to charm  So hallowed and so gracious is the time  This admirable author as well as the best and greatest men of all ages and of all nations seems to have had his mind throughly seasoned with religion as is evident by many passages in his plays that would not be suffered by a modern audience and are therefore certain instances that the age he lived in had a much greater sense of virtue than the present  It is indeed a melancholy reflection to consider that the British nation which is now at a greater height of glory for its councils and conquests than it ever was before should distinguish itself by a certain looseness of principles and a falling off from those schemes of thinking which conduce to the happiness and perfection of human nature This evil comes upon us from the works of a few solemn blockheads that meet together with the zeal and seriousness of apostles to extirpate common sense and propagate infidelity These are the wretches who without any show of wit learning or reason publish their crude conceptions with the ambition of appearing more wise than the rest of mankind upon no other pretence  than that of dissenting from them One gets by heart a catalogue of title pages and editions and immediately to become conspicuous declares that he is an unbeliever Another knows how to write a receipt or cut up a dog and forthwith argues against the immortality of the soul I have known many a little wit in the ostentation of his parts rally the truth of the scripture who was not able to read a chapter in it These poor wretches talk blasphemy for want of discourse and are rather the objects of scorn or pity than of our indignation but the grave disputant that reads and writes and spends all his time in convincing himself and the world that he is no better than a brute ought to be whipped out of a government as a blot to a civil society and a defamer of mankind I love to consider an infidel whether distinguished by the title of deist atheist or freethinker in three different lights in his solitudes his afflictions and his last moments  A wise man that lives up to the principles of reason and virtue if one considers him in his solitude as taking in the system of the universe observing the mutual dependence and harmony by which the whole frame of it hangs together beating down his passions or swelling his thoughts with magnificent ideas of providence makes a nobler figure in the eye of an intelligent being than the greatest conqueror amidst the pomps and solemnities of a triumph On the contrary there is not a more ridiculous animal than an atheist in his retirement His mind is incapable of rapture or elevation he can only consider himself as an insignificant figure in a landskip and wandering up and down in a field or meadow under the same terms as the meanest animals about him and as subject to as total a mortality as they with this aggravation that he is the only one amongst them who lies under the apprehension of it  In distresses he must be of all creatures the most helpless and forlorn he feels the whole pressure of a present calamity without being relieved by the memory of any  thing that is passed or the prospect of any thing that is to come Annihilation is the greatest blessing that he proposes to himself and an halter or a pistol the only refuge he can fly to But if you would behold one of these gloomy miscreants in his poorest figure you must consider him under the terrors or at the approach of death  About thirty years ago I was a shipboard with one of these vermin when there arose a brisk gale which could frighten no body but himself Upon the rowling of the ship he fell upon his knees and confessed to the chaplain that he had been a vile atheist and had denied a supreme being ever since he came to his estate The good man was astonished and a report immediately ran through the ship that there was an atheist upon the upperdeck Several of the common seamen who had never heard the word before thought it had been some strange fish but they were more surprized when they saw it was a man and heard out of his own mouth that he never believed till that day that there was a God As he lay in the agonies of confession one of the honest tarrs whispered to the boatswain that it would be a good deed to heave him overboard But we were now within sight of port when of a sudden the wind fell and the penitent relapsed begging all of us that were present as we were gentlemen not to say any thing of what had passed  He had not been ashore above two days when one of the company began to rally him upon his devotion on shipboard which the other denied in so high terms that it produced the lie on both sides and ended in a duel The atheist was thrust through the body and after some loss of blood became as good a Christian as he was at sea till he found that his wound was not mortal He is at present one of the freethinkers of the age and now writing a pamphlet against several received opinions concerning the existence of fairies  As I have taken upon me to censure the faults of the age and country which I live in I should have thought myself inexcusable to have passed over this crying one  which is the subject of my present discourse I shall therefore from time to time give my countrymen particular cautions against this distemper of the mind that is almost become fashionable and by that means more likely to spread I have somewhere either read or heard a very memorable sentence that a man would be a most insupportable monster should he have the faults that are incident to his years constitution profession family religion age and country and yet every man is in danger of them all For this reason as I am an old man I take particular care to avoid being covetous and telling long stories as I am choleric I forbear not only swearing but all interjections of fretting as pugh pish and the like As I am a layman I resolve not to conceive an aversion for a wise and good man because his coat is of a different colour from mine As I am descended of the ancient family of the Bickerstaffes I never call a man of merit an upstart As a Protestant I do not suffer my zeal so far to transport me as to name the pope and the devil together As I am fallen into this degenerate age I guard myself particularly against the folly I have been now speaking of And as I am an Englishman I am very cautious not to hate a stranger or despise a poor Palatine  Sir Richard Steele assisted in this paper  N  o  Saturday December  Ut in vita sic in studiis pulcherrimum et humanissimum existimo severitatem comitatemque miscere ne illa in tristitiam haec in petulantiam procedat  Plin Epist  SheerLane  December  I WAS walking about my chamber this morning in a very gay humour when I saw a coach stop at my door and a youth about fifteen alighting out of it who I perceived to be the eldest son of my bosomfriend that I gave some account of in my paper of the th of last  month I felt a sensible pleasure rising in me at the sight of him my acquaintance having begun with his father when he was just such a stripling and about that very age When he came up to me he took me by the hand and burst into tears I was extremely moved and immediately said child how does your father do He began to reply my mother but could not go on for weeping I went down with him into the coach and gathered out of him that his mother was then dying and that while the holy man was doing the last offices to her he had taken that time to come and call me to his father who he said would certainly break his heart if I did not go and comfort him The child's discretion in coming to me of his own head and the tenderness he showed for his parents would have quite overpowered me had I not resolved to fortify myself for the seasonable performance of those duties which I owed to my friend As we were going I could not but reflect upon the character of that excellent woman and the greatness of his grief for the loss of one who has ever been the support to him under all other afflictions How thought I will he be able to bear the hour of her death that could not when I was lately with him speak of a sickness which was then past without sorrow We were now got pretty far into Westminster and arrived at my friend's house At the door of it I met Favonius not without a secret satisfaction to find he had been there I had formely conversed with him at his house and as he abounds with that sort of virtue and knowlege which makes religion beautiful and never leads the conversation into the violence and rage of partydisputes I listened to him with great pleasure Our discourse chanced to be upon the subject of death which he treated with such a strength of reason and greatness of soul that instead of being terrible it appeared to a mind rightly cultivated altogether to be contemned or rather to be desired As I met him at the door I saw in his face a certain glowing of grief and humanity heightened with an  air of fortitude and resolution which as I afterwards found had such an irresistible force as to suspend the pains of the dying and the lamentation of the nearest friends who attended her I went up directly to the room where she lay and was met at the entrance by my friend who notwithstanding his thoughts had been composed a little before at the sight of me turned away his face and wept The little family of children renewed the expressions of their sorrow according to their several ages and degrees of understanding The eldest daughter was in tears busied in attendance upon her mother others were kneeling about the bedside and what troubled me most was to see a little boy who was too young to know the reason weeping only because his sisters did The only one in the room who seemed resigned and comforted was the dying person At my approach to the bedside she told me with a low broken voice this is kindly doneTake care of your friendDo not go from him She had before taken leave of her husband and children in a manner proper for so solemn a parting and with a gracefulness peculiar to a woman of her character My heart was torn to pieces to see the husband on one side suppressing and keeping down the swellings of his grief for fear of disturbing her in her last moments and the wife even at that time concealing the pains she endured for fear of encreasing his affliction She kept her eyes upon him for some moments after she grew speechless and soon after closed them for ever In the moment of her departure my friend who had thus far commanded himself gave a deep groan and fell into a swoon by her bedside The distraction of the children who thought they saw both their parents expiring together and now lying dead before them would have melted the hardest heart but they soon perceived their father recover whom I helped to remove into another room with a resolution to accompany him till the first pangs of his affliction were abated I knew consolation would now be impertinent and therefore contented myself to sit by  him and condole with him in silence For I shall here use the method of an ancient author who in one of his epistles relating the virtues and death of Macrinus's wife expresses himself thus  "I shall suspend my advice to this best of friends till he is made capable of receiving it by those three great remedies  necessitas ipsa dies longa et satietas doloris  the necessity of submission length of time and satiety of grief"  In the mean time I cannot but consider with much commiseration the melancholy state of one who has had such a part of himself torn from him and which he misses in every circumstance of life His condition is like that of one who has lately lost his right arm and is every moment offering to help himself with it He does not appear to himself the same person in his house at his table in company or in retirement and loses the relish of all the pleasures and diversions that were before entertaining to him by her participation of them The most agreeable objects recal the sorrow for her with whom he used to enjoy them This additional satisfaction from the taste of pleasures in the society of one we love is admirably described by Milton who represents Eve though in paradise itself no further pleased with the beautiful objects around her than as she sees them in company with Adam in that passage so inexpressibly charming  With thee conversing I forget all time  All seasons and their change all please alike  Sweet is the breath of morn her rising sweet  With charm of earliest birds pleasant the sun  When first on this delightful land he spreads  His orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower  Glist'ring with dew fragrant the fertile earth  After soft showers and sweet the coming on  Of grateful evening mild the silent night  With this her solemn bird and this fair moon  And these the gems of heaven her starry train  But neither breath of morn when she ascends  With charm of earliest birds nor rising sun  In this delightful land nor herb fruit flower  Glist'ring with dew nor fragrance after showers  Nor grateful evening mild nor silent night  With this her solemn bird nor walk by moon  Or glittering starlight without thee is sweet  The variety of images in this passage is infinitely pleasing and the recapitulation of each particular image with a little varying of the expressions makes one of the finest turns of words that I have ever seen which I rather mention because Mr Dryden has said in his preface to Juvenal that he could meet with no turn of words in Milton  It may further be observed that though the sweetness of these verses has something in it of a pastoral yet it excels the ordinary kind as much as the scene of it is above an ordinary field or meadow I might here since I am accidentally led into this subject show several passages in Milton that have as excellent turns of this nature as any of our English poets whatsoever but shall only mention that which follows in which he describes the fallen angels engaged in the intricate disputes of predestination freewill and foreknowlege and to humour the perplexity makes a kind of labyrinth in the very words that describe it  Others apart sat on a hill retir'd  In thoughts more elevate and reason'd high  Of providence foreknowlege will and fate  Fix'd fate freewill foreknowlege absolute  And found no end in wand'ring mazes lost  Sir Richard Steele assisted in this paper  N  o  Thursday January  Pars minima est ipsa puella sui  Ovid  SheerLane  January  THE court being prepared for proceeding on the cause of the Petticoat I gave orders to bring in a criminal who was taken up as she went out of the puppetshow about three nights ago and was now standing in the street with a great concourse of people about her Word was brought me that she had endeavoured twice or thrice to come in but could not do it by reason of her petticoat which was too large for the entrance of my house though I had ordered both the foldingdoors to be thrown open for its reception Upon this I desired the jury of matrons who stood at my right hand to inform themselves of her condition and know whether there were any private reasons why she might not make her appearance separate from her petticoat This was managed with great discretion and had such an effect that upon the return of the verdict from the bench of matrons I issued out an order forthwith that the criminal should be stripped of her incumbrances till she became little enough to enter my house I had before given directions for an engine of several legs that could contract or open itself like the top of an umbrello in order to place the petticoat upon it by which means I might take a leisurely survey of it as it should appear in its proper dimensions This was all done accordingly and forthwith upon the closing of the engine the petticoat was brought into court I then directed the machine to be set upon the table and dilated in such a manner as to show the garment in its utmost circumference but my great hall was too narrow for the experiment for before it was half unfolded it described so immoderate a circle that the lower part of it brushed upon my face as I sat in my chair of judicature I then enquired for the person  that belonged to the petticoat and to my great surprize was directed to a very beautiful young damsel with so pretty a face and shape that I bid her come out of the croud and seated her upon a little crock at my left hand  "My pretty maid said I do you own yourself to have been the inhabitant of the garment before us"  The girl I found had good sense and told me with a smile that notwithstanding it was her own petticoat she should be very glad to see an example made of it and that she wore it for no other reason but that she had a mind to look as big and burly as other persons of her quality that she had kept out of it as long as she could and till she began to appear little in the eyes of all her acquaintance that if she laid it aside people would think she was not made like other women I always give great allowances to the fair sex upon account of the fashion and therefore was not displeased with the defence of the pretty criminal I then ordered the vest which stood before us to be drawn up by a pully to the top of my great hall and afterwards to be spread open by the engine it was placed upon in such a manner that it formed a very splendid and ample canopy over our heads and covered the whole court of judicature with a kind of silken rotunda in its form not unlike the cupola of St Paul's I entered upon the whole cause with great satisfaction as I sate under the shadow of it  The council for the petticoat was now called in and ordered to produce what they had to say against the popular cry which was raised against it They answered the objections with great strength and solidity of argument and expatiated in very florid harangues which they did not fail to set off and furbelow if I may be allowed the metaphor with many periodical sentences and turns of oratory The chief arguments for their client were taken first from the great benefit that might arise to our woollen manufactury from this invention which was calculated as follows the common petticoat has not above four yards in the circumference whereas this over  our heads had more in the semidiameter so that by allowing it twentyfour yards in the circumference the five millions of woollen petticoats which according to Sir William Petty supposing what ought to be supposed in a wellgoverned state that all petticoats are made of that stuff would amount to thirty millions of those of the ancient mode A prodigious improvement of the woollen trade and what could not fail to sink the power of France in a few years  To introduce the second argument they begged leave to read a petition of the ropemakers wherein it was represented that the demand for cords and the price of them were much risen since this fashion came up At this all the company who were present lifted up their eyes into the vault and I must confess we did discover many traces of cordage which were interwoven in the stiffening of the drapery  A third argument was founded upon a petition of the Greenland trade which likewise represented the great consumption of the whalebone which would be occasioned by the present fashion and the benefit which would thereby accrue to that branch of the British trade  To conclude they gently touched upon the weight and unweildiness of the garment which they insinuated might be of great use to preserve the honour of families  These arguments would have wrought very much upon me as I then told the company in a long and elaborate discourse had I not considered the great and additional expence which such fashions would bring upon fathers and husbands and therefore by no means to be thought of till some years after a peace I further urged that it would be a prejudice to the ladies themselves who could never expect to have any money in the pocket if they laid out so much on the petticoat To this I added the great temptation it might give to virgins of acting in security like married women and by that means give a check to matrimony an institution always encouraged by wise societies  At the same time in answer to the several petitions produced on that side I shewed one subscribed by the women of several persons of quality humbly setting forth that since the introduction of this mode their respective ladies had instead of bestowing on them their castgowns cut them in shreds and mixed them with the cordage and backram to complete the stiffening of their underpetticoats For which and sundry other reasons I pronounced the petticoat a forfeiture But to shew that I did not make that judgment for the sake of filthy lucre I ordered it to be solded up and sent it as a present to a widowgentlewoman who has five daughters desiring she would make each of them a petticoat out of it and send me back the remainder which I design to cut into stomachers caps facings of my wastcoatsleeves and other garnitures suitable to my age and quality  I would not be understood that while I discard this monstrous invention I am an enemy to the proper ornaments of the fair sex On the contrary as the hand of nature has poured on them such a profusion of charms and graces and sent them into the world more amiable and finished than the rest of her works so I would have them bestow upon themselves all the additional beauties that art can supply them with provided it does not interfere with disguise or pervert those of nature  I consider woman as a beautiful romantic animal that may be adorned with furs and feathers pearls and diamonds ores and silks The lynx shall cast its skin at her feet to make her a tippet the peacock parrat and swan shall pay contributions to her muff the sea shall be searched for shells and the rocks for gems and every part of nature furnish out its share towards the embellishment of a creature that is the most consummate work of it All this I shall indulge them in but as for the petticoat I have been speaking of I neither can nor will allow it  No Saturday January  Durate et vosmet rebus servate secundis  Virg  SheerLane  January  WHEN I look into the frame and constitution of my own mind there is no part of it which I observe with greater satisfaction than that tenderness and concern which it bears for the good and happiness of mankind My own circumstances are indeed so narrow and scanty that I should taste but very little pleasure could I receive it only from those enjoyments which are in my own possession but by this great tincture of humanity which I find in all my thoughts and reflections I am happier than any single person can be with all the wealth strength beauty and success that can be conferred upon a mortal if he only relishes such a proportion of these blessings as is vested in himself and is his own private property By this means every man that does himself any real service does me a kindness I come in for my share in all the good that happens to a man of merit and virtue and partake of many gifts of fortune and power that I was never born to There is nothing in particular in which I so much rejoice as the deliverance of good and generous spirits out of dangers difficulties and distresses And because the world does not supply instances of this kind to furnish out sufficient entertainments for such an humanity and benevolence of temper I have ever delighted in reading the history of ages past which draws together into a narrow compass the great occurrences and events that are but thinly sown in those tracts of time which ly within our own knowlege and observation When I see the life of a great man who has deserved well of his country after having struggled through all the oppositions of prejudice and envy breaking out with lustre and shining forth in all the splendor of success I close my book and am an happy man for a whole evening  But since in history events are of a mixed nature and often happen alike to the worthless and the deserving insomuch that we frequently see a virtuous man dying in the midst of disappointments and calamities and the vicious ending their days in prosperity and peace I love to amuse myself with the accounts I meet with in fabulous histories and fictions for in this kind of writings we have always the pleasure of seeing vice punished and virtue rewarded Indeed were we able to view a man in the whole circle of his existence we should have the satisfaction of seeing it close with happiness or misery according to his proper merit but though our view of him is interrupted by death before the finishing of his adventures if I may so speak we may be sure that the conclusion and catastrophe is altogether suitable to his behaviour On the contrary the whole being of a man considered as an hero or a knighterrant is comprehended within the limits of a poem or romance and therefore always ends to our satisfaction so that inventions of this kind are like food and exercise to a goodnatured disposition which they please and gratify at the same time that they nourish and strengthen The greater the affliction is in which we see our favourites in these relations engaged the greater is the pleasure we take in seeing them relieved  Among the many feigned histories which I have met with in my reading there is none in which the hero's perplexity is greater and the winding out of it more difficult than that in a Freneh author whose name I have forgot It so happens that the hero's mistress was the sister of his most intimate friend who for certain reasons was given out to be dead while he was preparing to leave his country in quest of adventures The hero having heard of his friend's death immediately repaired to his mistress to condole with her and comfort her Upon his arrival in her garden he discovered at a distance a man clasped in her arms and embraced with the most endearing tenderness What should he do It did not consist with the getleness of a knight errant either to kill his mistress or  the man whom she was pleased to favour At the same time it would have spoiled a romance should he have laid violent hands on himself In short he immediately entered upon his adventures and after a long series of exploits found out by degrees that the person he saw in his mistress's arms was her own brother taking leave of her before he left his country and the embrace she gave him nothing else but the affectionate farewel of a sister so that he had at once the two greatest satisfactions that could enter into the heart of man in sinding his friend alive whom he thought dead and his mistress faithful whom he had believed inconstant  There are indeed some disasters so very fatal that it is impossible for any accidents to rectify them Of this kind was that of poor Lucretia and yet we see Ovid has found an expedient even in a case like hers He describes a beautiful and royal virgin walking on the seashore where she was discovered by Neptune and violated after a long and unsuccessful importunity To mitigate her sorrow he offers her whatever she would wish for Never certainly was the wit of woman more puzzled in finding out a stratagem to retrieve her honour Had she desired to be turned into a stock or stone a beast fish or fowl she would have been a loser by it or had she desired to have been made a seanymph or a goddess her immortality would have but perpetuated her disgrace Give me therefore said she such a shape as may make me incapable of suffering again the like calamity or of being reproached for what I have already suffered To be short she was turned into a man and by that only means avoided the danger and imputation she so much dreaded  I was once myself in agonies of grief that are unutterable and in so great a distraction of mind that I thought myself even out of the possibility of receiving comfort The occasion was as follows when I was a youth in a part of the army which was then quartered at Dover I fell in love with an agreeable young woman of a good family in  those parts and had the satisfaction of seeing my addresses kindly received which occasioned the perplexity I am going to relate  We were in a calm evening diverting ourselves upon the top of the clift with the prospect of the sea and trifling away the time in such little fondnesses as are most ridiculous to people in business and most agreeable to those in love  In the midst of these our innocent endearments she snatched a paper of verses out of my hand and ran away with them I was following her when on a sudden the ground though at a considerable distance from the verge of the precipice sunk under her and threw her down from so prodigious an height upon such a range of rocks as would have dashed her into ten thousand pieces had her body been made of adamant It is much easier for my reader to imagine my state of mind upon such an occasion than for me to express it I said to myself it is not in the power of heaven to relieve me when I awaked equally transported and astonished to see myself drawn out of an affliction which the very moment before appeared to me altogether inextricable  The impressions of grief and horror were so lively on this occasion that while they lasted they made me more miserable than I was at the real death of this beloved person which happened a few months after at a time when the match between us was concluded inasmuch as the imaginary death was untimely and I myself in a sort an accessary whereas her decease had at least the alleviations of being natural and inevitable  The memory of the dream I have related still dwells so strongly upon me that I can never read the description of DoverCliff in Shakespear's tragedy of King Lear without a fresh sense of my escape The prospect from that place is drawn with such proper incidents that whoever can read it without growing giddy must have a good head or a very bad one  Come on Sir here's the place stand still how fearful  And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low  The crows and choughs that wing the midway air  Show scarce as gross as beetles Halfway down  Hangs one that gathers samphire Dreadful trade  Methinks he seems no bigger than his head  The fishermen that walk upon the beach  Appear like mice and yond' tall anchoring bark  Diminish'd to her boat her boat a buoy  Almost too small for sight The murmuring surge  That on th' unnumber'd idle pebble beats  Cannot be heard so high I'll look no more  Lest my brain turn  N  o  Thursday January  In tenui labor  Virg  SheerLane  January  I HAVE lately applied myself with much satisfaction to the curious discoveries that have been made by the help of microscopes as they are related by authors of our own and other nations There is a great deal of pleasure in prying into this world of wonders which nature has laid out of sight and seems industrious to conceal from us Philosophy had ranged over all the visible creation and began to want objects for her enquiries when the present age by the invention of glasses opened a new and inexhauslible magazine of rarities more wonderful and amazing than any of those which astonished our forefathers I was yesterday amusing myself with speculations of this kind and reflecting upon myriads of animals that swim in those little seas of juices that are contained in the several vessels of an human body While my mind was thus filled with that secret wonder and delight I could not but look upon myself as in an act of devotion and am very well pleased with the thought of the great heathen anatomist  who calls his description of the parts of an human body  An hymn to the supreme being  The reading of the day produced in my imagination an agreeable morning's dream if I may call it such for I am still in doubt whether it passed in my sleeping or waking thoughts However it was I fancied that my good genius stood at my bed'shead and entertained me with the following discourse for upon my rising it dwelt so strongly upon me that I writ down the substance of it if not the very words  If said he you can be so transported with those productions of nature which are discovered to you by those artificial eyes that are the works of human invention how great will your surprize be when you shall have it in your power to model your own eye as your please and adapt it to the bulk of objects which with all these helps are by infinite degrees too minute for your perception We who are unbodied spirits can sharpen our sight to what degree we think fit and make the least work of the creation distinct and visible This gives us such ideas as cannot possibly enter into your present conceptions There is not the least particle of matter which may not furnish one of us sufficient employment for a whole eternity We can still divide it and still open it and still discover new wonders of providence as we look into the different texture of its parts and meet with beds of vegetables mineral and metallic mixtures and several kinds of animals that ly hid and as it were lost in such an endless fund of matter I find you are surprised at this discourse but as your reason tells you there are infinite parts in the smallest portion of matter it will likewise convince you that there is as great a variety of secrets and as much room for discoveries in a particle no bigger than the point of a pin as in the globe of the whole earth Your microscopes bring to sight shoals of living creatures in a spoonful of vinegar but we who can distinguish them in their different magnitudes see among them several huge Leviathans that terrify  the little fry of animals about them and take their pastime as in an ocean or the great deep I could not but smile at this part of his relation and told him I doubted not but he could give me the history of several invisible giants accompanied with their respective dwarfs in case that any of these little beings are of an human shape You may assure yourself said he that we see in these little animals different natures instincts and modes of life which correspond to what you observe in creatures of bigger dimensions We descry millions of species subsisted on a green leaf which your glasses represent only in crouds and swarms What appears to your eye but as an hair or down rising on the surface of it we find to be woods and forests inhabited by beasts of prey that are as dreadful in those their haunts as lions and tigers in the desarts of Lybia I was much delighted with his discourse and could not forbear telling him that I should be wonderfully pleased to see a natural history of Imperceptibles containing a true account of such vegetables and animals as grow and live out of sight Such disquisitions answered he are very suitable to reasonable creatures and you may be sure there are many curious spirits amongst us who employ themselves in such amusements For as our hands and all our senses may be formed to what degree of strength and delicacy we please in the same manner as our sight we can make what experiments we are inclined to how small soever the matter be in which we make them I have been present at the dissection of a mite and have seen the skeleton of a flea I have been shewn a forest of numberless trees which has been picked out of an acorn Your miscroscope can shew you in it a complete oak in miniature and could you suit all your organs as we do you might pluck an acorn from this little oak which contains another tree and so proceed from tree to tree as long as you would think fit to continue your disquisitions It is almost impossible added he to talk of things so remote from common life and the ordinary notions which mankind receive from blunt and  gross organs of sense without appearing extravagant and ridiculous You have often seen a dog opened to observe the circulation of the blood or make any other useful enquiry and yet would be tempted to laugh if I should tell you that a circle of much greater philosophers than any of the royal society were present at the cutting up of one of those little animals which we find in the blue of a plumb that it was tied down alive before them and that they observed the palpitations of the heart the course of the blood the working of the muscles and the convulsions in the several limbs with great accuracy and improvement I must confess said I for my own part I go along with you in all your discoveries with great pleasure but it is certain they are too fine for the gross of mankind who are more struck with the description of every thing that is great and bulky Accordingly we find the best judge of human nature setting forth his wisdom not in the formation of these minute animals though indeed no less wonderful than the other but in that of the Leviathan and Behemoth the Horse and the Crocodile Your observation said he is very just and I must acknowlege for my own part that although it is with much delight that I see the traces of providence in these instances I still take greater pleasure in considering the works of the creation in their immensity than in their minuteness For this reason I rejoice when I strengthen my sight so as to make it pierce into the most remote spaces and take a view of those heavenly bodies which lie out of the reach of human eyes though assisted by telescopes What you look upon as one confused white in the milkyway appears to me a long tract of heavens distinguished by stars that are ranged in proper figures and constellations While you are admiring the sky in a starry night I am entertained with a variety of worlds and suns placed one above another and rising up to such an immense distance that no created eye can see an end of them  The latter part of this discourse slung me into such an  astonishment that he had been silent for some time before I took notice of it when on a sudden I started up and drew my curtains to look if any one was near me but saw nobody and cannot tell to this moment whether it was my good genius or a dream that left me  No Saturday January  Velut silvis ubi passim  Palantes error certo de tramite pellit  Ille sinistrorsum hic dextrorsum abit  Hor  SheerLane  January  INSTEAD of considering any particular passion or character in any one set of men my thoughts were last night employed on the contemplation of human life in general and truly it appears to me that the whole species are hurried on by the same desires and engaged in the same pursuits according to the different stages and divisions of life Youth is devoted to lust middleage to ambition oldage to avarice These are the three general motives and principles of action both in good and bad men though it must be acknowleged that they change their names and refine their natures according to the temper of the person whom they direct and animate For with the good lust becomes virtuous love ambition true honour and avarice the care of posterity This scheme of thought amused me very agreeably till I retired to rest and afterwards formed itself into a pleasing and regular vision which I shall describe in all its circumstances as the objects presented themselves whether in a serious or ridiculous manner  I dreamed that I was in a wood of so prodigious an extent and cut into such a variety of walks and allies that all mankind were lost and bewildered in it After having wandered up and down some time I came into the centre of it which opened into a wide plain filled with multitudes  of both sexes I here discovered three great roads very wide and long that led into three different parts of the forest On a sudden the whole multitude broke into three parts according to their different ages and marched in their respective bodies into the three great roads that lay before them As I had a mind to know how each of these roads terminated and whither it would lead those who passed through them I joined myself with the assembly that were in the flower and vigour of their age and called themselves  The band of lovers  I found to my great surprize that several old men besides myself had intruded into this agreeable company as I had before observed there were some young men who had united themselves to the band of misers and were walking up the path of Avarice though both made a very ridiculous figure and were as much laughed at by those they joined as by those they forsook The walk which we marched up for thickness of shades embroidery of flowers and melody of birds with the distant purling of streams and falls of water was so wonderfully delightful that it charmed our senses and intoxicated our minds with pleasure We had not been long here before every man singled out some woman to whom he offered his addresses and professed himself a lover when on a sudden we perceived this delicious walk to grow more narrow as we advanced in it till it ended in many intricate thickets mazes and labyrinths that were so mixed with roses and brambles brakes of thorns and beds of flowers rocky paths and pleasing grottos that it was hard to say whether it gave greater delight or perplexity to those who travelled in it  It was here that the lovers began to be eager in their pursuits Some of their mistresses who only seemed to retire for the sake of form and decency led them into plantations that were disposed into regular walks where after they had wheeled about in some turns and windings they suffered themselves to be overtaken and gave their hands to those who pursued them Others withdrew from their followers into little wildernesses where there  were so many paths interwoven with each other in so much confusion and irregularity that several of the lovers quitted the pursuits or broke their hearts in the chace It was sometimes very odd to see a man pursuing a fine woman that was following another whose eye was fixed upon a fourth that had her own game in view in some other quarter of the wilderness I could not but observe two things in this place which I thought very particular that several persons who stood only at the end of the avenues and cast a careless eye upon the nymphs during their whole flight often catched them when those who pressed them the most warmly through all their turns and doubles were wholly unsuccessful and that some of my own age who were at first looked upon with aversion and contempt by being well acquainted with the wilderness and by dodging their women in the particular corners and allies of it catched them in their arms and took them from those who they really loved and admired There was a particular grove which was called  The labyrinth of coquettes  where many were enticed to the chace but few returned with the purchase It was pleasant enough to see a celebrated beauty by smiling upon one casting a glance upon another beckoning upon a third and adapting her charms and graces to the several sollies of those that admired her drawing into the labyrinth a whole pack of lovers that lost themselves in the maze and never could find their way out of it However it was some satisfaction to me to see many of the fair ones who had thus deluded their followers and left them among the intricacies of the labyrinth obliged when they came out of it to surrender to the first partner that offered himself I now had crossed over all the difficult and perplexed passages that seemed to bound our walk when on the other side of them I saw the same great road running on a little way till it was terminated by two beautiful temples I stood here for some time and saw most of the multitude who had been dispersed amongst the thickets coming out two by two and marching up in pairs towards  the temples that stood before us The structure on the right hand was as I afterwards found consecrated to Virtuous Love and could not be entered but by such as received a ring or some other token from a person who was placed as a guard at the gate of it He wore a garland of roses and mirtles on his head and on his shoulders a robe like an imperial mantle white and unspotted all over excepting only that where it was clasped at his breast there were two golden turtle doves that buttoned it by their bills which were wrought in rubies He was called by the name of Hymen and was seated near the temple in a delicious bower made up of several trees that were embraced by woodbines jessamines and amaranths which were as so many emblems of marriage and ornaments to the trunks that supported them As I was single and unaccompanied I was not permitted to enter the temple and for that reason am a stranger to all the mysteries that were performed in it I had however the curiosity to observe how the several couples that entered were disposed of which was after the following manner There were two great gates on the backside of the edifice at which the whole croud was let out At one of these gates were two women extremely beautiful though in a different kind the one having a very careful and composed air and the other a sort of smile and ineffable sweetness in her countenance The name of the first was Discretion and of the other Complacency All who came out of this gate and put themselves under the direction of these two sisters were immediately conducted by them into gardens groves and meadows which abounded in delights and were furnished with every thing that could make them the proper seats of happiness The second gate of this temple let out all the couples that were unhappily married who came out linked together by chains which each of them strove to break but could not Several of these were such as had never been acquainted with each other before they met in the great walk or had been too well acquainted in the thicket The entrance of this gate was possessed  by three sisters who joined themselves with these wretches and occasioned most of their miseries The youngest of the sisters was known by the name of Levity who with the innocence of a virgin had the dress and behaviour of a harlot The name of the second was Contention who bore on her right arm a muff made of the skin of a porcupine and on her left carried a little lapdog that barked and snapped at every one that passed by her  The eldest of the sisters who seemed to have an haughty and imperious air was always accompanied with a tawny Cupid who generally marched before her with a little mace on his shoulder the end of which was fashioned into the horns of a stag Her garments were yellow and her complexion pale Her eyes were piercing but had odd casts in them and that particular distemper which makes persons who are troubled with it see objects double Upon enquiry I was informed that her name was Jealousy  Having finished my observations upon this temple and its votaries I repaired to that which stood on the left hand and was called  The temple of lust  The front of it was raised on Corinthian pillars with all the meretricious ornaments that accompany that order whereas that of the other was composed of the chaste and matronlike Ionic The sides of it were adorned with several grotesque figures of goats sparrows heathen gods satyrs and monsters made up of half man and half beast The gates were unguarded and open to all that had a mind to enter Upon my going in I found the windows were blinded and let in only a kind of twilight that served to discover a prodigious number of dark corners and apartments into which the whole temple was divided I was here stunned with a mixed noise of clamour and jollity on one side of me I heard singing and dancing on the other brawls and clashing of swords In short I was so little pleased with the place that I was going out of it but found I could not return by the gate where I entered which was barred against all that were  come in with bolts of iron and locks of adamant There was no going back from this temple through the paths of pleasure which led to it all who passed through the ceremonies of the place went out at an iron wicket which was kept by a dreadful giant called Remorse that held a scourge of scorpions in his hand and drove them into the only outlet from that temple This was a passage so rugged so uneven and choaked with so many thorns and briars that it was a melancholy spectacle to behold the pains and difficulties which both sexes suffered who walked through it The men though in the prime of their youth appeared weak and infeebled with old age the women wrung her hands and tore their hair and several lost their limbs before they could extricate themselves out of the perplexities of the path in which they were engaged The remaining part of this vision and the adventures I met with in the two great roads of Ambition and Avarice must be the subject of another paper  ADVERTISEMENT  I have this morning received the following letter from the famous Mr Thomas Dogget  SIR  ON Monday next will be acted for my benefit the comedy of Love for Love If you will do me the honour to appear there I will publish on the bills that it is to be performed at the request of Isaac Bickerstaffe  Esq  and question not but it will bring me as great an audience as ever was at the house since the Morocco ambassador was there  I am With the greatest respect Your most obedient and most humble servant THOMAS DOGGET  Being naturally an encourager of wit as well as bound to it in the quality of censor I returned the following answer  MR DOGGET  I AM very well pleased with the choice you have made of so excellent a play and have always looked upon you as the best of comedians I shall therefore come in between the first and second act and remain in the righthand box over the pit till the end of the fourth provided you take care that every thing be rightly prepared for my reception  No Tuesday January  Similis tibi Cynthia vel tibi cujus  Turbavit nitidos extinctus passer ocellos  From my own apartment  January  I WAS recollecting the remainder of my vision when my maid came to me and told me there was a gentlewoman below who seemed to be in great trouble and pressed very much to see me When it lay in my power to remove the distress of an unhappy person I thought I should very ill employ my time in attending matters of speculation and therefore desired the lady would walk in When she entered I saw her eyes full of tears however her grief was not so great as to make her omit rules for she was very long and exact in her civilities which gave me time to view and consider her Her clothes were very rich but tarnished and her words very fine but ill applied These distinctions made me without hesitation though I had never seen her before ask her if her lady had any commands for me She then began to weep afresh and with many broken sighs told me that their family was in very great afflictionI beseeched her to compose herself for that I might possibly be capable of assisting themShe then cast her eye upon my little dog and was again transported with too much passion to proceed but with much ado she at last gave me to understand that Cupid her lady's lapdog was dangerously ill and in so bad a condition that her lady  neither saw company nor went abroad for which reason she did not come herself to consult me that as I had mentioned with great affection my own dog here she curtsied and looking first at the cur and then on me said Indeed I had reason for he was very pretty her lady sent to me rather than to any other doctor and hoped I would not laugh at her sorrow but send her my advice I must confess I had some indignation to find myself treated like something below a farrier yet well knowing that the best as well as most tender way of dealing with a woman is to fall in with her humours and by that means to let her see the absurdity of them I proceeded accordingly Pray madam said I can you give me any methodical account of this illness and how Cupid was first taken Sir said she we have a little ignorant countrygirl who is kept to tend him she was recommended to our family by one that my lady never saw but once at a visit and you know persons of quality are always inclined to strangers for I could have helped her to a cousin of my own butGood madam said I you neglect the account of the sick body while you are complaining of this girl No no Sir said she begging your pardon but it is the general fault of physicians they are so in haste that they never hear out the case I say this silly girl after washing Cupid let him stand half an hour in the window without his collar where he catched cold and in an hour after began to bark very hoarse He had however a pretty good night and we hoped the danger was over but for these two nights last past neither he nor my lady have slept a wink Has he said I taken any thing No said she but my lady says he shall take any thing that you prescribe provided you do not make use of Jesuits powder or the cold bath Poor Cupid continued she has always been pthisical and as he lies under something like a chincough we are afraid it will end in a consumption I then asked her if she had brought any of his water to show me Upon this she stared me in the face and said I am afraid Mr Bickerstaffe you are not serious  but if you have any receipt that is proper on this occasion pray let us have it for my mistress is not to be comforted Upon this I paused a little without returning any answer and after some short silence I proceeded in the following manner I have considered the nature of the distemper and the constitution of the patient and by the best observation that I can make on both I think it is safest to put him into a course of kitchin physic In the mean time to remove his hoarsness it will be the most natural way to make Cupid his own druggist for which reason I shall prescribe to him three mornings successively as much powder as will ly on a groat of that noble remedy which the apothecaries call Album Graecum Upon hearing this advice the young woman smiled as if she knew how ridiculous an errand she had been employed in and indeed I found by the sequel of her discourse that she was an arch baggage and of a character that is frequent enough in persons of her employment who are so used to conform themselves in every thing to the humours and passions of their mistresses that they sacrifice superiority of sense to superiority of condition and are insensibly betrayed into the passions and prejudices of those whom they serve without giving themselves leave to consider that they are extravagant and ridiculous However I thought it very natural when her eyes were thus open to see her give a new turn to her discourse and from sympathizing with her mistress in her follies to fall a railing at her You cannot imagine said she Mr Bickerstaffe what a life she makes us lead for the sake of this ugly cur if he dies we are the most unhappy family in town She chanced to lose a parrat last year which to tell you truly brought me into her service for she turned off her woman upon it who had lived with her ten years because she neglected to give him water though every one of the family says she was as innocent of the bird's death as the babe that is unborn Nay she told me this very morning that if Cupid should die she would send the poor innocent wench I was telling you of to  Bridewell and have the milkwoman tried for her life at the OldBaily for putting water into his milk In short she talks like any distracted creature  Since it is so young woman said I I will by no means let you offend her by staying on this message longer than is absolutely necessary and so forced her out  While I am studying to cure those evils and distresses that are necessary or natural to human life I find my task growing upon me since by these accidental cares and acquired calamities if I may so call them my patients contract distempers to which their constitution is of itself a stranger But this is an evil I have for many years remarked in the fair sex and as they are by nature very much formed for affection and dalliance I have observed that when by too obstinate a cruelty or any other means they have disappointed themselves of the proper objects of love as husbands or children such virgins have exactly at such a year grown fond of lapdogs parrats or other animals I know at this time a celebrated toast whom I allow to be one of the most agreeable of her sex that in the presence of her admirers will give a torrent of kisses to her cat any one of which a Christian would be glad of I do not at the same time deny but there are as great enormities of this kind committed by our sex as theirs A Roman emperor had so very great an esteem for an horse of his that he had thoughts of making him a consul and several moderns of that rank of men whom we call country squires will not scruple to kiss their hounds before all the world and declare in the presence of their wives that they had rather salute a favourite of the pack than the finest woman in England These voluntary friendships between animals of different species seem to arise from instinct for which reason I have always looked upon the mutual goodwill between the squire and the hound to be of the same nature with that between the lion and the jackall  The only extravagance of this kind which appears to me excusable is one that grew out of an excess of gratitude  which I have somewhere met with in the life of a Turkish emperor His horse had brought him safe out of a field of battle and from the pursuit of a victorious enemy As a reward for such his good and faithful service his master built him a stable of marble shod him with gold fed him in an ivory manger and made him a rack of silver He annexed to the stable several fields and meadows lakes and running streams At the same time he provided for him a seraglio of mares the most beautiful that could be found in the whole Ottoman empire To these were added a suitable train of domestics consisting of grooms farriers rubbers  etc  accommodated with proper liveries and pensions In short nothing was omitted that could contribute to the ease and happiness of his life who had preserved the emperor's  By reason of the extreme cold and the changeableness of the weather I have been prevailed upon to allow the free use of the fardingal till the th of February next ensuing  N  o  Thursday January  Cur in theatrum Cato severe venisti  Mart  From my own apartment  January  I FIND it is thought necessary that I who have taken upon me to censure the irregularities of the age should give an account of my actions when they appear doubtful or subject to misconstruction My appearing at the play on  NB  A person dressed for Isaac Bickerstaffe did appear at the playhouse on this occasion  Monday last is looked upon as a step in my conduct which I ought to explain that others may not be misled by my example It is true in matter of fact I was present at the ingenious entertainment of that day and placed myself in a box which was prepared for me with great civility and distinction It is said of Virgil when he entered a Roman theatre where there  were many thousands of spectators present that the whole assembly rose up to do him honour a respect which was never before paid to any but the emperor I must confess that universal clap and other testimonies of applause with which I was received at my first appearance in the theatre of Great Britain gave me as sensible delight as the abovementioned reception could give to that immortal poet I should be ungrateful at the same time if I did not take this opportunity of acknowleging the great civilities that were shown me by Mr Thomas Dogget who made his compliments to me between the acts after a most ingenuous and discreet manner and at the same time communicated to me that the company of upholders desired to receive me at their door at the end of the Haymarket and to light me home to my lodgings That part of the ceremony I forbad and took particular care during the whole play to observe the conduct of the drama and give no offence by my own behaviour Here I think it will not be foreign to my character to lay down the proper duties of an audience and what is incumbent upon each individual spectator in public diversions of this nature Every one should on these occasions shew his attention understanding and virtue I would undertake to find out all the persons of sense and breeding by the effect of a single sentence and to distinguish a gentleman as much by his laugh as his bow When we see the footman and his lord diverted by the same jest it very much turns to the diminution of the one or the honour of the other But though a man's quality may appear in his understanding and taste the regard to virtue ought to be the same in all ranks and conditions of men however they make a profession of it under the name of honour religion or morality When therefore we see any thing divert an audience either in tragedy or comedy that strikes at the duties of civil life or exposes what the best men in all ages have looked upon as sacred and inviolable it is the certain sign of a profligate race of men who are fallen from the virtue of their  forefathers and will be contemptible in the eyes of their posterity For this reason I took great delight in seeing the generous and disinterested passion of the lovers in this comedy which stood so many trials and was proved by such a variety of diverting incidents received with an universal approbation This brings to my mind a passage in Cicero which I could never read without being in love with the virtue of a Roman audience He there describes the shouts and applauses which the people gave to the persons who acted the parts of Pylades and Orestes on the noblest occasion that a poet could invent to shew friendship in perfection One of them had forfeited his life by an action which he had committed and as they stood in judgment before the tyrant each of them strove who should be the criminal that he might save the life of his friend Amidst the vehemence of each asserting himself to be the offender the Roman audience gave a thunder of applause and by that means as the author hints approved in others what they would have done themselves on the like occasion Methinks a people of so much virtue were deservedly placed at the head of mankind but alas pleasures of this nature are not frequently to be met with on the English stage  The Athenians at a time when they were the most polite as well as the most powerful government in the world made the care of the stage one of the chief parts of the administration and I must confess I am astonished at the spirit of virtue which appeared in that people upon some expressions in a scene of a famous tragedy an account of which we have in one of Seneca's Epistles A covetous person is represented speaking the common sentiments of all who are possessed with that vice in the following soliloquy which I have translated literally  Let me be called a base man so I am called a rich one If a man is rich who asks if he is good The question is how much we have not from whence and by what means we have it Every one has so much merit as he has wealth For my own part let me be rich oh ye gods or let me die The  man dies happily who dies increasing his treasure There is more pleasure in the possession of wealth than in that of parents children wife or friends  The audience were very much provoked by the first words of this speech but when the actor came to the close of it they could bear no longer In short the whole assembly rose up at once in the greatest fury with a design to pluck him off the stage and brand the work itself with infamy In the midst of the tumult the author came out from behind the scenes begging the audience to be composed for a little while and they should see the tragical end which this wretch should come to immediately The promise of punishment appeased the people who sat with great attention and pleasure to see an example made of so odious a criminal It is with shame and concern that I speak it but I very much question whether it is possible to make a speech so impious as to raise such a laudable horror and indignation in a modern audience  It is very natural for an author to make ostentation of his reading as it is for an old man to tell stories for which reason I must beg the reader will excuse me if I for once indulge myself in both these inclinations We see the attention judgment and virtue of a whole audience in the foregoing instances If we would imitate the behaviour of a single spectator let us reflect upon that of Socrates in a particular which gives me as great an idea of that extraordinary man as any circumstance of his life or what is more of his death This venerable person often frequented the theatre which brought a great many thither out of a desire to see him On which occasion it is recorded of him that he sometimes stood to make himself the more conspicuous and to satisfy the curiosity of the beholders He was one day present at the first representation of a tragedy of Euripides who was his intimate friend and whom he is said to have assisted in several of his plays In the midst of the tragedy which had met with very great success there chanced to be a line that seemed to encourage vice and immorality  This was no sooner spoken but Socrates rose from his seat and without any regard to his affection for his friend or to the success of the play showed himself displeased at what was said and walked out of the assembly I question not but the reader will be curious to know what the line was that gave this divine heathen so much offence If my memory fails me not it was in the part of Hippolitus who when he is pressed by an oath which he had taken to keep silence returned for answer that he had taken the oath with his tongue but not with his heart Had a person of a vicious character made such a speech it might have been allowed as a proper representation of the baseness of his thoughts but such an expression out of the mouth of the virtuous Hippolitus was giving a sanction to falshood and establishing perjury by a maxim  Having got over all interruptions I have set apart tomorrow for the closing of my vision  No Saturday January  Audire atque togam jubeo componere quisquis  Ambitione mala aut argenti pallet amore  Hor  From my own apartment  January  A continuation of the Vision  WITH much labour and difficulty I passed through the first part of my vision and recovered the centre of the wood from whence I had the prospect of the three great roads I here joined myself to the middleaged party of mankind who marched behind the standard of Ambition The great road lay in a direct line and was terminated by the Temple of Virtue It was planted on each side with laurels which were intermixed with marble trophies carved pillars and statues of lawgivers heroes statesmen philosophers and poets The persons who travelled up this great path were such whose thoughts  were bent upon doing eminent services to mankind or promoting the good of their country On each side of this great road were several paths that were also laid out in straight lines and ran parallel with it These were most of them covered walks and received into them men of retired virtue who proposed to themselves the same end of their journey though they chose to make it in shade and obscurity The edifices at the extremity of the walk were so contrived that we could not see the Temple of Honour by reason of the Temple of Virtue which stood before it At the gates of this temple we were met by the goddess of it who conducted us into that of Honour which was joined to the other edifice by a beautiful triumphal arch and had no other entrance into it When the deity of the inner structure had received us she presented us in a body to a figure that was placed over the high altar and was the emblem of Eternity She sat on a globe in the midst of a golden zodiac holding the figure of a sun in one hand and a moon in the other Her head was veiled and her feet covered Our hearts glowed within us as we stood amidst the sphere of light which this image cast on every side of it  Having seen all that happened to this band of adventurers I repaired to another pile of building that stood within view of the Temple of Honour and was raised in imitation of it upon the very same model but at my approach to it I found that the stones were laid together without mortar and that the whole fabric stood upon so weak a foundation that it shook with every wind that blew This was called the Temple of Vanity The goddess of it sat in the midst of a great many tapers that burned day and night and made her appear much better than she would have done in open daylight Her whole art was to shew herself more beautiful and majestic than she really was For which reason she had painted her face and wore a cluster of false jewels upon her breast but what I more particularly observed was the breadth of her petticoat which was made altogether  in the fashion of a modern fardingal This place was filled with hypocrites pedants freethinkers and prating politicians with a rabble of those who have only titles to make them great men Female votaries crouded the temple choaked up the avenues of it and were more in number than the sand upon the sea shore I made it my business in my return towards that part of the wood from whence I first set out to observe the walks which led to this temple for I met in it several who had begun their journey with the band of virtuous persons and travelled some time in their company but upon examination I found that there were several paths which led out of the great road into the sides of the wood and ran into so many crooked turns and windings that those who travelled through them often turned their backs upon the Temple of Virtue then crossed the straight road and sometimes marched in it for a little space till the crooked path which they were engaged in again led them into the wood The several alleys of these wanderers had their particular ornaments one of them I could not but take notice of in the walk of the mischievous pretenders to politics which had at every turn the figure of a person whom by the inscription I found to be Machiavel pointing out the way with an extended finger like a Mercury  I was now returned in the same manner as before with a design to observe carefully every thing that passed in the region of Avarice and the occurrences in that assembly which was made up of persons of my own age This body of travellers had not gone far in the third great road before it led them insensibly into a deep valley in which they journied several days with great toil and uneasiness and without the necessary refreshments of food and sleep The only relief they met with was in a river that ran through the bottom of the valley on a bed of golden sand they often drank of this stream which had such a particular quality in it that though it refreshed them for a time it rather inflamed than quenched their thirst On each side of the river was a range of hills full  of precious ore for where the rains had washed off the earth one might see in several parts of them veins of gold and rocks that looked like pure silver We were told that the deity of the place had forbad any of his votaries to dig into the bowels of these hills or convert the treasures they contained to any use under pain of starving At the end of the valley stood the Temple of Avarice made after the manner of a fortification and surrounded with a thousand tripleheaded dogs that were placed there to keep off beggars At our approach they all fell a barking and would have very much terrified us had not an old woman who had called herself by the forged name of Competency offered herself for our guide She carried under her garment a golden bough which she no sooner held up in her hand but the dogs lay down and the gates flew open for our reception We were led through an hundred iron doors before we entered the temple At the upper end of it sat the god of Avarice with a long filthy beard and a meagre starved countenance enclosed with heaps of ingots and pyramids of money but half naked and shivering with cold On his right hand was a fiend called Rapine and on his left a particular favourite to whom he had given the title of Parsimony The first was his collector and the other his cashier  There were several long tables placed on each side of the temple with respective officers attending behind them Some of these I enquired into At the first table was kept the office of Corruption Seeing a solicitor extremely busy and whispering every body that passed by I kept my eye upon him very attentively and saw him often going up to a person that had a pen in his hand with a multiplication table and an almanack before him which as I afterwards heard was all the learning he was master of The solicitor would often apply himself to his ear and at the same time convey money into his hand for which the other would give him out a piece of paper or parchment signed and sealed in form The name of this dextrous and successful solicitor was Bribery At the  next table was the office of Extortion Behind it sat a person in a bobwig counting over a great sum of money He gave out little purses to several who after a short tour brought him in return sacks full of the same kind of coin I saw at the same time a person called Fraud who sat behind a counter with false scales light weights and scanty measures by the skilful application of which instruments she had got together an immense heap of wealth It would be endless to name the several officers or describe the votaries that attended in this temple There were many old men panting and breathless reposing their heads on bags of money nay many of them actually dying whose very pangs and convulsions which rendered their purses useless to them only made them grasp them the faster There were some tearing with one hand all things even to the garments and flesh of many miserable persons who stood before them and with the other hand throwing away what they had seized to harlots flatterers and panders that stood behind them  On a sudden the whole assembly fell a trembling and upon enquiry I found that the great room we were in was haunted with a spectre that many times a day appeared to them and terrified them to distraction  In the midst of their terror and amazement the apparition entered which I immediately knew to be Poverty Whether it were by my acquaintance with this phantom which had rendered the sight of her more familiar to me or however it was she did not make so indigent or frightful a figure in my eye as the god of this lothsome temple The miserable votaries of this place were I found of another mind Every one fancied himself threatened by the apparition as she stalked about the room and began to lock their coffers and tie their bags with the utmost fear and trembling  I must confess I look upon the passion which I saw in this unhappy people to be of the same nature with those unaccountable antipathies which some persons are born with or rather as a kind of phrensy not unlike  that which throws a man into terrors and agonies at the sight of so useful and innocent a thing as water The whole assembly was surprised when instead of paying my devotions to the deity whom they all adored they saw me address myself to the phantom  "Oh Poverty said I my first petition to thee is that thou wouldst never appear to me hereafter but if thou wilt not grant me this that thou wouldst not bear a form more terrible than that in which thou appearest to me at present Let not thy threats and menaces betray me to any thing that is ungrateful or unjust Let me not shut my ears to the cries of the needy Let me not forget the person that has deserved well of me Let me not for any fear of thee desert my friend

company thou art always chearful Liberty and Innocence"  The conclusion of this Vision must be deferred to another opportunity  N  o  Thursday February  Scelus est jugulare falernum  Et dare Campano toxica saeva mero  Mart  SheerLane  February  THERE is in this city a certain fraternity of chymical operators who work under ground in holes caverns and dark retirements to conceal their mysteries from the eyes and observation of mankind These subterraneous philosophers are daily employed in the transmigration of liquors and by the power of magical drugs and incantations raising under the streets of London the choicest products of the hills and valleys of France They can  squeeze Bourdeaux out of a Sloe and draw Champagne from an Apple Virgil in that remarkable prophecy  Incultisque rubens pendebit sentibus uva  The ripening grape shall hang on every thorn  seems to have hinted at this art which can turn a plantation of Northern hedges into a vineyard These adepts are known among one another by the name of winebrewers and I am afraid do great injury not only to her majesty's customs but to the bodies of many of her good subjects  Having received sundry complaints against these invisible workmen I ordered the proper officer of my court to ferret them out of their respective caves and bring them before me which was yesterday executed accordingly  The person who appeared against them was a merchant who had by him a great magazine of wines that he had laid in before the war but these gentlemen as he said had so vitiated the nation's palate that no man could believe his to be French because it did not taste like what they sold for such As a man never pleads better than where his own personal interest is concerned he exhibited to the court with great eloquence that this new corporation of druggists had inflamed the bills of mortality and puzzled the college of physicians with diseases for which they neither knew a name nor cure He accused some of giving all their customers cholics and megrims and mentioned one who had boasted he had a tun of claret by him that in a fortnight's time should give the gout to a dozen of the healthfullest men in the city provided that their constitutions were prepared for it by wealth and idleness He then enlarged with a great show of reason upon the prejudice which these mixtures and compositions had done to the brains of the English nation as is too visible said he from many late pamphlets speeches  and sermons as well as from the ordinary conversations of the youth of this age He then quoted an ingenious person who would undertake to know by a man's writings the wine he most delighted in and on that occasion named a certain satyrist whom he had discovered to be the author of a lampoon by a manifest taste of the sloe which showed itself in it by much roughness and little spirit  In the last place he ascribed to the unnatural tumults and fermentations which these mixtures raise in our blood the divisions heats and animosities that reign among us and in particular asserted most of the modern enthusiasms and agitations to be nothing else but the effects of adulterated Port  The council for the brewers had a face so extremely inflamed and illuminated with carbuncles that I did not wonder to see him an advocate for these sophistications His rhetoric was likewise such as I should have expected from the common draught which I found he often drank to a great excess Indeed I was so surprized at his figure and parts that I ordered him to give me a taste of his usual liquor which I had no sooner drank but I found a pimple rising in my forehead and felt such a sensible decay in my understanding that I would not proceed in the trial till the fume of it was entirely dissipated  This notable advocate had little to say in the defence of his clients but that they were under a necessity of making claret if they would keep open their doors it being the nature of mankind to love every thing that is prohibited He further pretended to reason that it might be as profitable to the nation to make French wine as French hats and concluded with the great advantage that this had already brought to part of the kingdom Upon which he informed the court that the lands in Herefordshire were raised two years purchase since the beginning of the war  When I had sent out my summons to these people I  gave at the same time orders to each of them to bring the several ingredients he made use of in distinct phials which they had done accordingly and ranged them into two rows on each side of the court The workmen were drawn up in ranks behind them The merchant informed me that in one row of phials were the several colours they dealt in and in the other the tastes He then shewed me on the right hand one who went by the name of Tom Tintoret who as he told me was the greatest master in his colouring of any vintner in London To give me a proof of his art he took a glass of fair water and by the infusion of three drops out of one of his phials converted it into a most beautiful pale Burgundy Two more of the same kind heightened it into a perfect Languedoc from thence it passed into a florid Hermitage and after having gone through two or three other changes by the addition of a single drop ended in a very deep Pontack This ingenious virtuoso seeing me very much surprised at his art told me that he had not an opportunity of shewing it in perfection having only made use of water for the groundwork of his colouring but that if I were to see an operation upon liquors of stronger bodies the art would appear to much greater advantage He added that he doubted not but it would please my curiosity to see the cyder of one apple take only a vermilion when another with a less quantity of the same infusion would rise into a dark purple according to the different texture of parts in the liquor He informed me also that he could hit the different shades and degrees of red as they appear in the pink and the rose the clove and the carnation as he had Rhenish or Moselle Perry or White Port to work in  I was so satisfied with the ingenuity of this virtuoso that after having advised him to quit so dishonest a profession I promised him in consideration of his great genius to recommend him as a partner to a friend of mine who has heaped up great riches and is a scarletdyer  The artists on my other hand were ordered in the second place to make some experiments of their skill before me upon which the famous Harry Sippet stept out and asked me what I would be pleased to drink At the same time he filled out three or four white liquors in a glass and told me that it should be what I pleased to call for adding very learnedly that the liquor before him was as the naked substance or first matter of his compound to which he and his friend who stood overagainst him could give what accidents or form they pleased Finding him so great a philosopher I desired he would convey into it the qualities and essence of right Bourdeaux Coming coming Sir said he with the air of a drawer and after having cast his eye on the several tastes and flavours that stood before him he took up a little cruet that was filled with a kind of inky juice and pouring some of it out into the glass of whitewine presented it to me and told me this was the wine over which most of the business of the last term had been dispatched I must confess I looked upon that sooty drug which he held up in his cruet as the quintessence of English Bourdeaux and therefore desired him to give me a glass of it by itself which he did with great unwillingness My cat at that time sat by me upon the elbow of my chair and as I did not care for making the experiment upon myself I reached it to her to sip of it which had like to have cost her her life for notwithstanding it flung her at first into freakish tricks quite contrary to her usual gravity in less than a quarter of an hour she fell into convulsions and had it not been a creature more tenacious of life than any other would certainly have died under the operation  I was so incensed by the tortures of my innocent domestic and the unworthy dealings of these men that I told them if each of them had as many lives as the injured creature before them they deserved to forfeit them for the pernicious arts which they used for their profit I therefore bid them look upon themselves as no better  than a kind of assassins and murderers within the law However since they had dealt so clearly with me and laid before me their whole practice I dismissed them for that time with a particular request That they would not poison any of my friends and acquaintance and take to some honest livelihood without loss of time  For my own part I am resolved hereafter to be very careful in my liquors and have agreed with a friend of mine in the army upon their next march to secure me two hogsheads of the best stomachwine in the cellars of Versailles for the good of my lucubrations and the comfort of my oldage  No Tuesday February  Dum tacent clamant  Tull  SheerLane  February  SILENCE is sometimes more significant and sublime than the most noble and most expressive eloquence and is on many occasions the indication of a great mind Several authors have treated of silence as a part of duty and discretion but none of them have considered it in this light Homer compares the noise and clamour of the Trojans advancing towards the enemy to the crackling of cranes when they invade an army of pygmies On the contrary he makes his countrymen and favourites the Greeks move forward in a regular determined march and in the depth of silence I find in the accounts which are given us of some of the more Eastern nations where the inhabitants are disposed by their constitutions and climates to higher strains of thought and more elevated raptures than what we seel in the Northern regions of the world that silence is a religious exercise among them For when their public devotions are in the greatest servour and their hearts lifted up as high as words can raise them there are certain suspensions of found and  motion for a time in which the mind is left to itself and supposed to swell with such secret conceptions as are too big for utterance I have myself been wonderfully delighted with a masterpiece of music when in the very tumult and ferment of their harmony all the voices and instruments have stopped short on a sudden and after a little pause recovered themselves again as it were and renewed the concert in all its parts Methoughts this short interval of silence has had more music in it than any the same space of time before or after it There are two instances of silence in the two greatest poets that ever wrote which have something in them as sublime as any of the speeches in their whole works The first is that of Ajax in the eleventh book of the Odyssey Ulysses who had been the rival of this great man in his life as well as the occasion of his death upon meeting his shade in the region of departed heroes makes his submission to him with an humility next to adoration which the other passes over with dumb sullen majesty and such a silence as to use the words of Longinus had more greatness in it than any thing he could have spoken  The next instance I shall mention is in Virgil where the poet doubtless imitates this silence of Ajax in that of Dido though I do not know that any of his commentators have taken notice of it Aeneas finding among the shades of despairing lovers the ghost of her who had lately died for him with the wound still fresh upon her addresses himself to her with expanded arms floods of tears and the most passionate professions of his own innocence as to what had happened all which Dido receives with dignity and disdain of a resenting lover and an injured queen and is so far from vouchsafing him an answer that she does not give him a single look The poet represents her as turning away her face from him while he spoke to her and after having kept her eyes for some time upon the ground as one that heard and contemned his protestations flying from him into the grove of myrtle  and into the arms of another whose fidelity had deserved her love  I have often thought our writers of tragedy have been very defective in this particular and that they might have given great beauty to their works by certain stops and pauses in the representation of such passions as it is not in the power of language to express There is something like this in the last act of Venice Preserved where Pierre is brought to an infamous execution and begs of his friend as a reparation for past injuries and the only favour he could do him to rescue him from the ignominy of the wheel by stabbing him As he is going to make this dreadful request he is not able to communicate it but withdraws his face from his friend's ear and bursts into tears The melancholy silence that follows hereupon and continues till he has recovered himself enough to reveal his mind to his friend raises in the spectators a grief that is inexpressible and an idea of such a complicated distress in the actor as words cannot utter It would look as ridiculous to many readers to give rules and directions for proper silences as for  penning a whisper  but it is certain that in the extremity of most passions particularly surprize admiration astonishment nay rage itself there is nothing more graceful than to see the play stand for a few moments and the audience fixed in an agreeable suspence during the silence of a skilful actor  But silence never shews itself to so great an advantage as when it is made the reply to calumny and defamation provided that we give no just occasion for them We might produce an example of it in the behaviour of one in whom it appeared in all its majesty and one whose silence as well as his person was altogether divine When one considers this subject only in its sublimity this great instance could not but occur to me and since I only make use of it to shew the highest example of it I hope I do not offend in it To forbear replying to an unjust reproach and overlook it with a generous or if possible with an entire neglect of it is one of the most  heroic acts of a great mind And I must confess when I reflect upon the behaviour of some of the greatest men of antiquity I do not so much admire them that they deserved the praise of the whole age they lived in as because they contemned the envy and detraction of it  All that is incumbent on a man of worth who suffers under so ill a treatment is to ly by for some time in silence and obscurity till the prejudice of the times be over and his reputation cleared I have often read with a great deal of pleasure a legacy of the famous lord Bacon one of the greatest geniuses that our own or any country has produced after having bequeathed his soul body and estate in the usual form he adds  "My name and memory I leave to foreign nations and to my countrymen after some time be passed over"  At the same time that I recommend this philosophy to others I must confess I am so poor a prosicient in it myself that if in the course of my lucubrations it happens as it has done more than once that my paper is duller than in conscience it ought to be I think the time an age till I have an opportunity of putting out another and growing famous again for two days  I must not close my discourse upon silence without informing my reader that I have by me an elaborate treatise on the Aposiopesis called an  Et caetera  it being a figure much used by some learned authors and particularly by the great Littleton who as my lord chief justice Coke observes had a most admirable talent at an  etc  No Thursday

apply to me for advice and send up their cases from all parts of Great Britain there are none who are more importunate with me and whom I am more inclined to answer than the Complainers One of them dates his letter to me from the banks of a purling stream where he used to rominate in solitude upon the divine Clarissa and where he is now looking about for a convenient leap which he tells me he is resolved to take unless I support him under the loss of that charming perjured woman Poor Lavinia presses as much for consolation on the other side and is reduced to such an extremity of despair by the inconstancy of Philander that she tells me she writes her letter with her pen in one hand and her garter in the other A gentleman of an ancient family in Norfolk is almost out of his wits upon account of a greyhound that after having been his inseparable companion for ten years is at last run mad Another who I believe is serious complains to me in a very moving manner of the loss of a wife and another in terms still more moving of a purse of money that was taken from him on Bagshot Heath and which he tells me would not have troubled him if he had given it to the poor In short there is scarce a calamity in human life that has not produced me a letter  It is indeed wonderful to consider how men are able to raise affliction to themselves out of every thing Lands  and houses sheep and oxen can convey happiness and misery into the hearts of reasonable creatures Nay I have known a muff a scarf or a tippet become a solid blessing or misfortune A lapdog has broke the hearts of thousands Flavia who had buried five children and two husbands was never able to get over the loss of her parrat How often has a divine creature been thrown into a fit by a neglect at a ball or an assembly Mopsa has kept her chamber ever since the last masquerade and is in greater danger of her life upon being left out of it than Clarinda from the violent cold which she caught at it Nor are these dear creatures the only sufferers by such imaginary calamities many an author has been dejected at the censure of one whom he ever looked upon as an idiot and many a hero cast into a fit of melancholy because the rabble have not hooted at him as he passed through the streets Theron places all his happiness in a running horse Suffenus in a gilded chariot Fulvius in a blue string and Florio a tuliproot It would be endless to enumerate the many fantastical afflictions that disturb mankind but as a misery is not to be measured from the nature of the evil but from the temper of the sufferer I shall present my readers who are unhappy either in reality or imagination with an allegory for which I am indebted to the great father and prince of poets  As I was sitting after dinner in my elbowchair I took up Homer and dipped into that famous speech of Achilles to Priam in which he tells him that Jupiter has by him two great vessels the one filled with blessings and the other with misfortunes out of which he mingles a composition for every man that comes into the world This passage so exceedingly pleased me that as I fell insensibly into my afternoon's slumber it wrought my imagination into the following dream  When Jupiter took into his hands the government of the world the several parts of nature with the presiding deities did homage to him One presented him with a mountain of winds another with a magazine of hail  and a third with a pile of thunderbolts The stars offered up their influences the ocean gave in his trident the earth her fruits and the sun his seasons Among the several deities who came to make their court on this occasion the Destinies advanced with two great tuns carried before them one of which they fixed at the right hand of Jupiter as he sat upon his throne and the other on his left The first was filled with all the blessings and the other with all the calamities of human life Jupiter in the beginning of his reign finding the world much more innocent than it is in this iron age poured very plentifully out of the tun that stood at his right hand but as mankind degenerated and became unworthy of his blessings he set abroach the other vessel that filled the world with pain and poverty battles and distempers jealousy and falshood intoxicating pleasures and untimely deaths  He was at length so very much incensed at the great depravation of human nature and the repeated provocations which he received from all parts of the earth that having resolved to destroy the whole species except Deucalion and Pyrrha he commanded the Destinies to gather up the blessings which he had thrown away upon the sons of men and lay them up till the world should be inhabited by a more virtuous and deserving race of mortals  The three sisters immediately repaired to the earth in search of the several blessings that had been scattered on it but found the task which was enjoined them to be much more difficult than they had imagined The first places they resorted to as the most likely to succeed in were cities palaces and courts but instead of meeting with what they looked for here they found nothing but envy repining uneasiness and the like bitter ingredients of the lefthand vessel Whereas to their great surprize they discovered content chearfulness health innocence and other the most substantial blessings of life in cottages shades and solitudes  There was another circumstance no less unexpected than the former and which gave them very great perplexity  in the discharge of the trust which Jupiter had committed to them They observed that several blessings had degenerated into calamities and that several calamities had improved into blessings according as they fell into the possession of wise or foolish men They often found power with so much insolence and impatience cleaving to it that it became a misfortune to the person on whom it was conferred Youth had often distempers growing about it worse than the infirmities of oldage wealth was often united to such a sordid avarice as made it the most uncomfortable and painful kind of poverty On the contrary they often found pain made glorious by fortitude poverty lost in content desormity beautified with virtue In a word the blessings were often like good fruits planted in a bad soil that by degrees fall off from their natural relish into tastes altogether insipid or unwholsome and the calamities like harsh fruits cultivated in a good soil and enriched by proper grafts and inoculations till they swell with generous and delightful juices  There was still a third circumstance that occasioned as great a surprize to the three sisters as either of the foregoing when they discovered several blessings and calamities which had never been in either of the tuns that stood by the throne of Jupiter and were nevertheless as great occasions of happiness or misery as any there These were that spurious crop of blessings and calamities which were never sown by the hand of the deity but grow of themselves out of the fancies and dispositions of human creatures Such are dress titles place equipage false shame and groundless sear with the like vain imaginations that shoot up in trifling weak and irresolute minds  The Destinies finding themselves in so great a perplexity concluded that it would be impossible for them to execute the commands that had been given them according to their first intention for which reason they agreed to throw all the blessings and calamities together into one large vessel and in that manner offer them up at the feet of Jupiter  This was performed accordingly the eldest sister presenting herself before the vessel and introducing it with an apology for what they had done  O Jupiter says she we have gathered together all the good and evil the comforts and distresses of human life which we thus present before thee in one promiscuous heap We beseech thee that thou thyself wilt sort them out for the future as in thy wisdom thou shalt think fit For we acknowlege that there is none beside thee that can judge what will occasion grief or joy in the heart of a human creature and what would prove a blessing or a calamity to the person on whom it is bestowed  N  o  Saturday March  Ut ameris amabilis esto  Ovid  From my own apartment  March  READING is to the mind what exercise is to the body as by the one health is preserved strengthened and invigorated by the other virtue which is the health of the mind is kept alive cherished and confirmed But as exercise becomes tedious and painful when we make use of it only as the means of health so reading is apt to grow uneasy and burdensome when we apply ourselves to it only for our improvement in virtue For this reason the virtue which we gather from a sable or an allegory is like the health we get by hunting as we are engaged in an agreeable pursuit that draws us on with pleasure and makes us insensible of the fatigues that accompany it  After this preface I shall set down a very beautiful allegorical fable of the great poet whom I mentioned in my last paper and whom it is very difficult to lay aside when one is engaged in the reading of him and this I particularly design for the use of several of my fair correspondents who in their letters have complained to me that they have lost the affections of their husbands and desire my advice how to recover them  Juno says Homer seeing her Jupiter seated on the top of mount Ida and knowing that he conceived an aversion to her began to study how she should regain his affections and make herself amiable to him With this thought she immediately retired into her chamber where she bathed herself in ambrosia which gave her person all its beauty and diffused so divine an odour as refreshed all nature and sweetened both heaven and earth She let her immortal tresses flow in the most graceful manner and took a particular care to dress herself in several ornaments which the poet describes at length and which the goddess chose out as the most proper to set off her person to the best advantage In the next place she made a visit to Venus the deity who presides over love and begged of her as a particular favour that she would lend her for a while those charms with which she subdued the hearts both of gods and men For says the goddess I would make use of them to reconcile the two deities who took care of me in my infancy and who at present are at so great a variance that they are estranged from each other's bed Venus was proud of an opportunity of obliging so great a goddess and therefore made her a present of the Cestus which she used to wear about her own waist with advice to hide it in her bosom till she had accomplished her intention This Cestus was a fine partycoloured girdle which as Homer tells us had all the attractions of the sex wrought into it The four principal figures in the embroidery were love desire fondness of speech and conversation filled with that sweetness and complacency which says the poet insensibly steal away the hearts of the wisest men  Juno after having made these necessary preparations came as by accident into the presence of Jupiter who is said to have been as much inflamed with her beauty as when he first stole to her embraces without the consent of their parents Juno to cover her real thoughts told him as she had told Venus that she was going to make a visit to Oceanus and Tethys He prevailed upon her to stay  with him protesting to her that she appeared more amiable in his eye than ever any mortal goddess or even herself had appeared to him till that day The poet then represents him in so great an ardour that without going up to the house which had been built by the hands of Vulcan according to Juno's direction he threw a golden cloud over their heads as they sat upon the top of mount Ida while the earth beneath them sprung up in lotus's saffrons hyacinths and a bed of the softest flowers for their repose  This close translation of one of the finest passages in Homer may suggest abundance of instruction to a woman who has a mind to preserve or recal the affection of her husband The care of the person and the dress with the particular blandishments woven in the Cestus are so plainly recommended by this fable and so indispensably necessary in every female who desires to please that they need no further explanation The discretion likewise in covering all matrimonial quarrels from the knowlege of others is taught in the pretended visit to Tethys in the speech where Juno addresses herself to Venus as the chaste and prudent management of a wife's charms is intimated by the same pretence for her appearing before Jupiter and by the concealment of the Cestus in her bosom  I shall leave this tale to the consideration of such good housewives who are never well dressed but when they are abroad and think it necessary to appear more agreeable to all men living than their husbands as also to those prudent ladies who to avoid the appearance of being overfond entertain their husbands with indifference aversion sullen silence or exasperating language  SheerLane  March  Upon my coming home last night I found a very handsome present of wine left for me as a taste of  hogsheads which are to be put to sale at    l a hogshead at Garraway's coffee house in Exchangealley on the    d instant  at three in the afternoon and to be tasted in major Long's vaults from the    th instant till the time of sale  This having been sent to me with a desire that I would give my judgment upon it I immediately impannelled a jury of men of nice palates and strong heads who being all of them very scrupulous and unwilling to proceed rashly in a matter of so great importance refused to bring in their verdict till three in the morning at which time the foreman pronounced as well as he was able extraaordinary French claret For my own part as I love to consult my pillow in all points of moment I slept upon it before I would give my sentence and this morning confirmed the verdict  Having mentioned this tribute of wine I must give notice to my correspondents for the future who shall apply to me on this occasion that as I shall decide nothing unadvisedly in matters of this nature I cannot pretend to give judgment of a right good liquor without examining at least three dozen bottles of it I must at the same time do myself the justice to let the world know that I have resisted great temptations in this kind as it is well known to a butcher in ClareMarket who endeavoured to corrupt me with a dozen and a half of marrowbones I had likewise a bribe sent me by a fishmonger consisting of a collar of brawn and a joll of salmon but not finding them excellent in their kinds I had the integrity to eat them both up without speaking one word of them However for the future I shall have an eye to the diet of this great city and will recommend the best and most wholesome food to them if I receive these proper and respectful notices from the sellers that it may not be said hereafter my readers were better taught than fed  No Tuesday March  Gustus element a per omnia quaerunt  Nunquam animo pretiis obstantibus  Juv  From my own apartment  March  HAVING intimated in my last paper that I design to take under my inspection the diet of this great city I shall begin with a very earnest and serious exhortation to all my welldisposed readers that they would return to the food of their forefathers and reconcile themselves to beef and mutton This was that diet which bred that hardy race of mortals who won the fields of Cressy and Agincourt I need not go up so high as the history of Guy earl of Warwick who is well known to have eaten up a dun cow of his own killing The renowned king Arthur is generally looked upon as the first who ever sat down to a whole roasted ox which was certainly the best way to preserve the gravy and it is further added that he and his knights sat about it at his round table and usually consumed it to the very bones before they would enter upon any debate of moment The Black prince was a professed lover of the brisket not to mention the history of the sirloin or the institution of the order of beefeaters which are all so many evident and undeniable marks of the great respect which our warlike predecessors have paid to this excellent food The tables of the ancient gentry of this nation were covered thrice a day with hot roast beef and I am credibly informed by an antiquary who has searched the registers in which the bills of fare of the court are recorded that instead of tea and bread and butter which have prevailed of late years the maids of honour in queen Elizabeth's time were allowed three rumps of beef for their breakfast Mutton has likewise been in great repute among our valiant countrymen but was formerly observed to be the food rather of men of nice and delicate appetites than those of strong  and robust constitutions For which reason even to this day we use the word sheepbiter as a term of reproach as we do beefeater in a respectful and honourable sense As for the flesh of lamb veal chicken and other animals under age they were the invention of sickly and degenerate palates according to that wholesome remark of Daniel the historian who takes notice That in all taxes upon provisions during the reigns of several of our kings there is nothing mentioned besides the flesh of such fowl and cattle as were arrived at their full growth and were mature for slaughter The common people of this kingdom do still keep up the taste of their ancestors and it is to this that we in a great measure owe the unparalleled victories that have been gained in this reign for I would desire my reader to consider what work our countrymen would have made at Blenheim and Ramillies if they had been fed with fricacies and ragousts  For this reason we at present see the florid complexion the strong limb and the hale constitution are to be found chiefly among the meaner sort of people or in the wild gentry who have been educated among the woods and mountains whereas many great families are insensibly fallen off from the athletic constitution of their progenitors and are dwindled away into a pale sickly spindlelegged generation of valetudinarians  I may perhaps be thought extravagant in my notion but I must confess I am apt to impute the dishonours that sometimes happen in great families to the inflaming kind of diet which is so much in fashion Many dishes can excite desire without giving strength and heat the body vithout nourishing it as physicians observe that the poorest and most dispirited blood is most subject to fevers I look upon a French ragoust to be as pernicious to the stomach as a glass of spirits and when I have seen a young lady swallow all the instigations of high soupes seasoned sauces and forced meats I have wondered at the despair or tedious sighing of her lovers  The rules among these false delicates are to be as contradictory as they can be to nature  Without expecting the return of hunger they eat for appetite and prepare dishes not to allay but to excite it  They admit of nothing at their tables in its natural form or without some disguise  They are to eat every thing before it comes in season and to leave it off as soon as it is good to be eaten  They are not to approve any thing that is agreeable to ordinary palates and nothing is to gratify their senses but what would offend those of their inferiors  I remember I was last summer invited to a friend's house who is a great admirer of the French cookery and as the phrase is  eats well  At our sitting down I found the table covered with a great variety of unknown dishes I was mightily at a loss to learn what they were and therefore did not know where to help myself That which stood before me I took to be a roasted porcupine however did not care for asking questions and have since been informed that it was only a larded turkey I afterwards passed my eye over several hashes which I do not know the names of to this day and hearing that they were delicacies did not think fit to meddle with them  Among other dainties I saw something like a pheasant and therefore desired to be helped to a wing of it but to my great surprize my friend told me it was a rabbet which is a sort of meat I never cared for At last I discovered with some joy a pig at the lower end of the table and begged a gentleman that was near to cut me a piece of it Upon which the gentleman of the house said with great civility I am sure you will like the pig for it was whipped to death I must confess I heard him with horror and could not eat of an animal that had died such a tragical death I was now in great hunger and confusion when methought I smelled the agreeable savour of roastbeef but could not tell from which dish it arose though I did not question but it lay disguised in one  of them Upon turning my head I saw a noble sirloin on the sidetable smoking in the most delicious manner I had recourse to it more than once and could not see without some indignation that substantial English dish banished in so ignominious a manner to make way for French kickshaws  The dessert was brought up at last which in truth was as extraordinary as any thing that had come before it The whole when ranged in its proper order looked like a very beautiful winterpiece There were several pyramids of candyed sweetmeats that hung like icicles with fruits scattered up and down and hid in an artificial kind of frost At the same time there were great quantities of cream beaten up into a snow and near them little plates of sugarplumbs disposed like so many heaps of hailstones with a multitude of congelations in jellies of various colours I was indeed so pleased with the several objects which lay before me that I did not care for displacing any of them and was half angry with the rest of the company that for the sake of a piece of lemmonpeel or a sugarplumb would spoil so pleasing a picture Indeed I could not but smile to see several of them cooling their mouths with lumps of ice which they had just before been burning with salts and peppers  As soon as this show was over I took my leave that I might finish my dinner at my own house for as I in every thing love what is simple and natural so particularly in my sood two plain dishes with two or three goodnatured chearful ingenious friends would make me more pleased and vain than all that pomp and luxury can bestow For it is my maxim that  he keeps the greatest table who has the most valuable company at it  No Thursday March  Dii quibus imperium est animarum umbraeque silentes  Et Chaos et Phlegethon loca nocte

but a very narrow province to employ his thoughts in For this reason persons of studious and contemplative natures often entertain themselves with the history of past ages or raise schemes and conjectures upon futurity For my own part I love to range through that half of eternity which is still to come rather than look on that which is already run out because I know I have a real share and interest in the one whereas all that was transacted in the other can be only matter of curiosity to me  Upon this account I have been always very much delighted with meditating on the soul's immortality and in reading the several notions which the wisest of men both ancient and modern have entertained on that subject What the opinions of the greatest philosophers have been I have several times hinted at and shall give an account of them from time to time as occasion requires It may likewise be worth while to consider what men of the most exalted genius and elevated imagination have thought of this matter Among these Homer stands up as a prodigy of mankind that looks down upon the rest of human creatures as a species beneath him Since he is the most ancient heathen author we may guess from his relation what were the common opinions in his time concerning the state of the soul after death  Ulysses he tells us made a voyage to the regions of the dead in order to consult Tiresias how he should return to his own country and recommend himself to the  favour of the gods The poet scarce introduces a single person who doth not suggest some useful precept to his reader and designs his description of the dead for the amendment of the living  Ulysses after having made a very plenteous sacrifice sat him down by the pool of holy blood which attracted a prodigious assembly of ghosts of all ages and conditions that hovered about the hero and feasted upon the steams of his oblation The first he knew was the shade of Elpenor who to shew the activity of a spirit above that of body is represented as arrived there long before Ulysses notwithstanding the winds and seas had contributed all their force to hasten his voyage thither This Elpenor to inspire the reader with a detestation of drunkenness and at the same time with a religious care of doing proper honours to the dead describes himself as having broken his neck in a debauch of wine and begs Ulysses that for the repose of his soul he would build a monument over him and perform funeral rites to his memory Ulysses with great sorrow of heart promises to fulfil his request and is immediately diverted to an object much more moving than the former The ghost of his own mother Anticlea whom he still thought living appears to him among the multitudes of shades that surrounded him and sits down at a small distance from him by the lake of blood without speaking to him or knowing who he was Ulysses was exceedingly troubled at the sight and could not forbear weeping as he looked upon her but being all along set forth as a pattern of consummate wisdom he makes his affection give way to prudence and therefore upon his seeing Tiresias does not reveal himself to his mother till he had consulted that great prophet who was the occasion of this his descent into the empire of the dead Tiresias having cautioned him to keep himself and his companions free from the guilt of sacrilege and to pay his devotions to all the gods promises him a return to his kingdom and family and a happy oldage in the enjoyment of them  The poet having thus with great art kept the curiosity of his reader in suspence represents his wife man after the dispatch of his business with Tiresias as yielding himself up to the calls of natural affection and making himself known to his mother Her eyes were no sooner opened but she cries out in tears  Oh my son  and enquires into the occasions that brought him thither and the fortune that attended him  Ulysses on the other hand desires to know what the sickness was that had sent her into those regions and the condition in which she had left his father his son and more particularly his wife She tells him they were all three inconsolable for his absence  and as for myself  says she  That was the sickness of which I died My impatience for your return my anxiety for your welfare and my fondness for my dear Ulysses were the only distempers that preyed upon my life and separated my soul from my body  Ulysses was melted with these expressions of tenderness and thrice endeavoured to catch the apparition in his arms that he might hold his mother to his bosom and weep over her  This gives the poet occasion to describe the notion the heathens at that time had of an unbodied soul in the excuse which the mother makes for seeming to withdraw herself from her son's embraces  The soul  says she  is composed neither of bones flesh nor sinews but leaves behind her all those incumbrances of mortality to be consumed on the funeral pile As soon as she hath thus cast her burden she makes her escape and flies away from it like a dream  When this melancholy conversation is at an end the poet draws up to view as charming a vision as could enter into man's imagination He describes the next who appeared to Ulysses to have been the shades of the finest women that had ever lived upon the earth and who had either been the daughters of kings the mistresses of gods or mothers of heroes such as Antiope Alcmena Leda Ariadne Iphimedia Eriphyle and several others of whom he gives a catalogue with a short history of their adventures The beautiful assembly of apparitions were all gathered  together about the blood each of them says Ulysses as a gentle satire upon female vanity  giving me an account of her birth and family  This scene of extraordinary women seems to have been designed by the poet as a lecture of mortality to the whole sex and to put them in mind of what they must expect notwithstanding the greatest perfections and highest honours they can arrive at  The circle of beauties at length disappeared and was succeeded by the shades of several Grecian heroes who had been engaged with Ulysses in the siege of Troy The first that approached was Agamemnon the generalissimo of that great expedition who at the appearance of his old friend wept very bitterly and without saying any thing to him endeavoured to grasp him by the hand Ulysses who was much moved at the sight poured out a flood of tears and asked him the occasion of his death which Agamemnon related to him in all its tragical circumstances how he was murdered at a banquet by the contrivance of his own wife in confederacy with her adulterer from whence he takes occasion to reproach the whole sex after a manner which would be inexcusable in a man who had not been so great a sufferer by them  My wife  says he  has disgraced all the women that shall ever be born into the world even those who hereafter shall be innocent Take care how you grow too fond of your wife Never tell her all you know If you reveal some things to her be sure you keep others concealed from her You indeed have nothing to fear from your Penelope she will not use you as my wife has treated me however take care how you trust a woman  The poet in this and other instances according to the system of many Heathen as well as Christian philosophers shews how anger revenge and other habits which the soul had contracted in the body subsist and grow in it under its state of separation  I am extremely pleased with the companions which the poet in the next description assigns to Achilles  Achilles  says the hero  came up to me with Patroclus and Antilochus  By which we may see that it was Homer's opinion  and probably that of the age he lived in that the friendships which are made among the living will likewise continue among the dead Achilles enquires after the welfare of his son and of his father with a fierceness of the same character that Homer has every where expressed in the actions of his life The passage relating to his son is so extremely beautiful that I must not omit it Ulysses after having described him as wife in council and active in war and mentioned the foes whom he had slain in battle adds an observation that he himself had made of his behaviour whilst he lay in the wooden horse  Most of the generals  says he  that were with us either wept or trembled as for your son I never saw him wipe a tear from his cheeks or change his countenance On the contrary he would often lay his hand upon his sword or grasp his spear as impatient to employ them against the Trojans  He then informs his father of the great honour and rewards which he had purchased before Troy and of his return from it without a wound The shade of Achilles says the poet was so pleased with the account he received of his son that he enquired no further but stalked away with more than ordinary majesty over the green meadow that lay before them  This last circumstance of a deceased father's rejoicing in the behaviour of his son is very finely contrived by Homer as an incentive to virtue and made use of by none that I know besides himself  The description of Ajax which follows and his refusing to speak to Ulysses who had won the armour of Achilles from him and by that means occasioned his death is admired by every one that reads it When Ulysses relates the sullenness of his deportment and considers the greatness of the hero he expresses himself with generous and noble sentiments  Oh that I had never gained a prize which cost the life of so brave a man as Ajax who for the beauty of his person and greatness of his actions was inferior to none but the divine Achilles  The same noble condescension which never dwells but in truly great minds  and such as Homer would represent that of Ulysses to have been discovers itself likewise in the speech which he made to the ghost of Ajax on that occasion  Oh Ajax  says he  Will you keep your resentment even after death what destructions hath this fatal armour brought upon the Greeks by robbing them of you who was their bulwark and defence Achilles is not more bitterly lamented among us than you Impute not then your death to any one but Jupiter who out of his anger to the Greeks took you away from among them let me entreat you to approach me restrain the fierceness of your wrath and the greatness of your soul and hear what I have to say to you  Ajax without making any reply turned his back upon him and retired into a croud of ghosts  Ulysses after all these visions took a view of those impious wretches who lay in tortures for the crimes they had committed upon the earth whom he describes under all the varieties of pain as so many marks of divine vengeance to deter others from following their example He then tells us that notwithstanding he had a great curiosity to see the heroes that lived in the ages before him the ghosts began to gather about him in such prodigious multitudes and with such confusion of voices that his heart trembled as he saw himself amidst so great a scene of horrors He adds that he was afraid lest some hideous spectre should appear to him that might terrify him to distraction and therefore withdrew in time  I question not but my reader will be pleased with this description of a future state represented by such a noble and fruitful imagination that had nothing to direct it besides the light of nature and the opinions of a dark and ignorant age  No Saturday April  Bombalio Clangor Stridor Taratantara Murmur  Farn Rhet  From my own apartment  March  I HAVE heard of a very valuable picture wherein all the painters of the age in which it was drawn are represented sitting together in a circle and joining in a concert of music Each of them plays upon such a particular instrument as is the most suitable to his character and expresses that stile and manner of painting which is peculiar to him The famous cupolapainter of those times to shew the grandeur and boldness of his figures hath a horn in his mouth which he seems to wind with great strength and force On the contrary an eminent artist who wrought up his pictures with the greatest accuracy and gave them all those delicate touches which are apt to please the nicest eye is represented as tuning a theorbo The same kind of humour runs through the whole piece  I have often from this hint imagined to myself that different talents in discourse might be shadowed out after the same manner by different kinds of music and that the several conversable parts of mankind in this great city might be cast into the proper characters and divisions as they resemble several instruments that are in use among the masters of harmony Of these therefore in their order and first of the drum  Your drums are the blusterers in conversation that with a loud laugh unnatural mirth and a torrent of noise domineer in public assemblies overbear men of sense stun their companions and fill the place they are in with a ratling sound that hath seldom any wit humour or good breeding in it The drum notwithstanding by this boisterous vivacity is very proper to impose upon the ignorant and in conversation with ladies who are not of the sinest taste often passes for a man of mirth and wit  for wonderful pleasant company I need not observe that the emptiness of the drum very much contributes to its noise  The lute is a character directly opposite to the drum that sounds very finely by itself or in a very small concert Its notes are exquisitely sweet and very low easily drowned in a multitude of instruments and even lost among a few unless you give a particular attention to it A lute is seldom heard in a company of more than five whereas a drum will shew itself to advantage in an assembly of five hundred The lutanists therefore are men of a fine genius uncommon reflection great affability and esteemed chiefly by persons of a good taste who are the only proper judges of so delightful and soft a melody  The trumpet is an instrument that has in it no compass of music or variety of sound but is notwithstanding very agreeable so long as it keeps within its pitch It has not above four or five notes which are however very pleasing and capable of exquisite turns and modulations The gentlemen who fall under this denomination are your men of the most fashionable education and refined breeding who have learned a certain smoothness of discourse and sprightliness of air from the polite company they have kept but at the same time have shallow parts weak judgments and a short reach of understanding a playhouse a drawingroom a ball a visiting day or a ring at Hidepark are the few notes they are masters of which they touch upon in all conversations The trumpet however is a necessary instrument about a court and a proper enlivener of a concert though of no great harmony by itself  Violins are the lively forward importunate wits that distinguish themselves by the flourishes of imagination sharpness of repartee glances of satire and bear away the upper part in every concert I cannot however but observe that when a man is not disposed to hear music there is not a more disagreeable sound in harmony than that of a violin  There is another musical instrument which is more frequent in this nation than any other I mean your bassviol which grumbles in the bottom of the concert and with a surly masculine sound strengthens the harmony and tempers the sweetness of the several instruments that play along with it The bassviol is an instrument of a quite different nature to the trumpet and may signify men of rough sense and unpolished parts who do not love to hear themselves talk but sometimes break out with an agreeable bluntness unexpected wit and surly pleasantries to the no small diversion of their friends and companions In short I look upon every sensible trueborn Briton to be naturally a bassviol  As for your rural wits who talk with great eloquence and alacrity of foxes hounds horses quicksethedges and sixbargates double ditches and broken necks I am in doubt whether I should give them a place in the conversable world However if they will content themselves with being raised to the dignity of huntinghorns I shall desire for the future that they may be known by that name  I must not here omit the bagpipe species that will entertain you from morning to night with the repetition of a few notes which are played over and over with the perpetual humming of a drone running underneath them These are your dull heavy tedious storytellers the load and burden of conversations that set up for men of importance by knowing secret history and giving an account of transactions that whether they ever  in the world or not doth not signify a halfpenny  its instruction or its welfare Some have observed that the Northern parts of this island are more particularly fruitful in bagpipes  There are so very few persons who are masters in every  of conversation and can talk on all subjects that I  know whether we should make a distinct species of  nevertheless that my scheme may not be defective  of those few who are endowed with such extraordinary  talents I shall allow them to be harpsicords a kind of music which every one knows is a concert by itself  As for your passagebells who look upon mirth as criminal and talk of nothing but what is melancholy in itself and mortifying to human nature I shall not mention them  I shall likewise pass over in silence all the rabble of mankind that croud our streets coffeehouses feasts and public tables I cannot call their discourse conversation but rather something that is practised in imitation of it For which reason if I would describe them by any musical instrument it should be by those modern inventions of the bladder and string tongs and key marrowbone and cleaver  My reader will doubtless observe that I have only touched here upon male instruments having reserved my female concert to another occasion If he has a mind to know where these several characters are to be met with I could direct him to a whole club of drums not to mention another of bagpipes which I have before given some account of in my description of our nightly meetings in SheerLane The lutes may often be met with in couples upon the banks of a chrystal stream or in the retreats of shady woods and slowery meadows which for different reasons are likewise the great resort of your huntinghorns Bassviols are frequently to be found over a glass of stalebeer and a pipe of tobacco whereas those who set up for violins seldom fail to make their appearance at Will's once every evening You may meet with a trumpet any where on the other side of Charingcross  That we may draw something for our advantage in life out of the foregoing discourse I must intreat my reader to make a narrow search into his life and conversation and upon his leaving any company to examine himself seriously whether he has behaved himself in it like a dram or a trumpet a violin or a bassviol and accordingly endeavour to mend his music for the future  For my own part I must confess I was a drum for many years nay and a noisy one till having polished myself a little in good company I threw as much of the trumpet into my conversation as was possible for a man of an impetuous temper by which mixture of different musics I look upon myself during the course of many years to have resembled a tabor and pipe I have since very much endeavoured at the sweetness of the lute but in spite of all my resolutions I must confess with great confusion that I find myself daily degenerating into a bagpipe whether it be the effect of my oldage or of the company I keep I know not All that I can do is to keep a watch over my conversation and to silence the drone as soon as I find it begin to hum in my discourse being determinated rather to hear the notes of others than to play out of time and encroach upon their parts in the concert by the noise of so tiresome an instrument  I shall conclude this paper with a letter which I received last night from a friend of mine who knows very well my notions upon this subject and invites me to pass the evening at his house with a select company of friends in the following words  DEAR ISAAC  I INTEND to have a concert at my house this evening having by great chance got a harpsicord which I am sure will entertain you very agreeably There will be likewise two lutes and a trumpet let me beg you to put yourself in tune and believe me  Your very faithful servant NICHOLAS HUMDRUM  No Tuesday April  Obscuris vera involvens  Virg Aen  From my own apartment  April  WE have already examined Homer's description of a future state and the condition in which he hath placed the souls of the deceased I shall in this paper make some observations on the account which Virgil hath given us of the same subject who besides a greatness of genius had all the lights of philosophy and human learning to assist and guide him in his discoveries  Aeneas is represented as descending into the empire of death with a prophetess by his side who instructs him in the secrets of those lower regions  Upon the confines of the dead and before the very gates of this insernal world Virgil describes several inhabitants whose natures are wonderfully suited to the situation of the place as being either the occasions or resemblances of death Of the first kind are the shadows of Sickness Oldage Fear Famine and Poverty apparitions very terrible to behold with several others as Toil War Contention and Discord which contribute all of them to people this common receptacle of human souls As this was likewise a very proper residence for every thing that resembles Death the poet tells us that Sleep whom he represents as a near relation to Death has likewise his habitation in these quarters and describes in them a huge gloomy elmtree which seems a very proper ornament for the place and is possessed by an innumerable swarm of Dreams that hang in clusters under every leaf of it He then gives us a list of imaginary persons who very naturally ly within the shadow of the Dreamtree as being of the same kind of make in themselves and the materials or to use Shakespear's phrase the stuff of which dreams are made Such are the shades of the giant with a hundred hands and of his brother with three bodies of the  doubleshaped Centaur and Scylla the Gorgon with snakey hair the Harpy with a woman's face and lion's talons the sevenheaded Hydra and the Chimaera which breathes forth a flame and is a compound of three animals These several mixed natures the creatures of imagination are not only introduced with great art after the dreams but as they are planted at the very entrance and within the very gates of those regions do probably denote the wild deliriums and extravagancies of fancy which the soul usually falls into when she is just upon the verge of death  Thus far Aeneas travels in an allegory The rest of the description is drawn with great exactness according to the religion of the heathens and the opinions of the Platonic philosophy I shall not trouble my reader with a common dull story that gives an account why the heathens first of all supposed a ferryman in hell and his name to be Charon but must not pass over in silence the point of doctrine which Virgil hath very much insisted upon in this book that the souls of those who are unburied are not permitted to go over into their respective places of rest till they have wandered a hundred years upon the banks of Styx This was probably an invention of the heathen priesthood to make the people extremely careful of performing proper rites and ceremonies to the memory of the dead I shall not however with the infamous scriblers of the age take an occasion from such a circumstance to run into declamations against priestcraft but rather look upon it even in this light as a religious artifice to raise in the minds of men an esteem for the memory of their sorefathers and a desire to recommend themselves to that of posterity as also to excite in them an ambition of imitating the virtues of the deceased and to keep alive in their thoughts the sense of the soul's immortality In a word we may say in defence of the severe opinions relating to the shades of unburied persons what hath been said by some of our divines in regard to the rigid doctrines concerning the souls of such who  die without being initiated into our religion that supposing they should be erroneous they can do no hurt to the dead and will have a good effect upon the living in making them cautious of neglecting such necessary solemnities  Charon is no sooner appeased and the tripleheaded dog laid asleep but Aeneas makes his entrance into the dominions of Pluto There are three kinds of persons described as being situated on the borders and I can give no reason for their being stationed there in so particular a manner but because none of them seem to have had a proper right to a place among the dead as not having run out the whole thread of their days and finished the term of life that had been allotted them upon earth The first of these are the souls of infants who are snatched away by untimely ends the second are of those that are put to death wrongfully and by an unjust sentence and the third of those who grew weary of their lives and laid violent hands upon themselves As for the second of these Virgil adds with great beauty that Minos the judge of the dead is employed in giving them a rehearing and assigning them their several quarters suitable to the parts they acted in life The poet after having mentioned the souls of those unhappy men who destroyed themselves breaks out into a fine exclamation  Oh how gladly  says he  would they now endure life with all its miseries But the Destinies forbid their return to earth and the waters of Styx surround them with nine streams that are unpassable  It is very remarkable that Virgil notwithstanding selfmurder was so frequent among the heathens and had been practised by some of the greatest men in the very age before him hath here represented it as so heinous a crime But in this particular he was guided by the doctrines of his great master Plato who says on this subject that a man is placed in his station of life like a soldier in his proper post which he is not to quit whatever may happen until he is called off by his commander who planted him in it  There is another point in the Platonic philosophy which Virgil has made the groundwork of the greatest  part of the piece we are now examining having with wonderful art and beauty materialized if I may so call it a scheme of abstracted notions and clothed the most nice resined conceptions of philosophy in sensible images and poetical representations The Platonists tell us that the soul during her residence in the body contracts many virtuous and vicious habits so as to become a beneficent mild charitable or an angry malicious revengeful being a substance inflamed with lust avarice and pride or on the contrary brightened with pure generous and humble dispositions that these and the like habits of virtue and vice growing into the very essence of the soul survive and gather strength in her after her dissolution that the torments of a vicious soul in a future state arise principally from those importunate passions which are not capable of being gratified without a body and that on the contrary the happiness of virtuous minds very much consists in their being employed in sublime speculations innocent diversions sociable affections and all the ecstasies of passion and rapture which are agreeable to reasonable natures and of which they gained a relish in this life  Upon this foundation the poet raises that beautiful description of the secret haunts and walks which he tells us are inhabited by deceased lovers  Not far from hence says he lies a great waste of plains that are called the Fields of Melancholy In these there grows a forest of myrtle divided into many shady retirements and covered walks and inhabited by the souls of those who pined away with love The passion says he continues with them after death He then gives a list of this languishing tribe in which his own Dido makes the principal figure and is described as living in this soft romantic scene with the shade of her first husband Sichaeus  The poet in the next place mentions another plain that was peopled with the ghosts of warriors as still delighting in each others company and pleased with the exercise of arms He there represents the Grecian generals and  common soldiers who perished in the siege of Troy as drawn up in squadrons and terrified at the approach of Aeneas which renewed in them those impressions of fear they had before received in battle with the Trojans He afterwards likewise upon the same notion gives a view of the Trojan heroes who lived in former ages amidst a visionary scene of chariots and arms flowery meadows shining spears and generous steeds which he tells us were their pleasures upon earth and now make up their happiness in Elysium For the same reason also he mentions others as singing paeans and songs of triumph amidst a beautiful grove of laurel The chief of the concert was the poet Musaeus who stood inclosed with a circle of admirers and rose by the head and shoulders above the throng of shades that surrounded him The habitations of unhappy spirits to shew the duration of their torments and the desperate condition they are in are represented as guarded by a fury moated round with a lake of fire strengthened with towers of iron encompassed with a triple wall and fortified with pillars of adamant which all the gods together are not able to heave from their foundations The noise of stripes the clank of chains and the groans of the tortured strike the pious Aeneas with a kind of horror The poet afterwards divides the criminals into two classes the first and blackest catalogue consists of such as were guilty of outrages against the gods and the next of such who were convicted of injustice between man and man the greatest number of whom says the poet are those who followed the dictates of avarice  It was an opinion of the Platonists that the souls of men having contracted in the body great stains and pollutions of vice and ignorance there were several purgations and cleansings necessary to be passed through both here and hereafter in order to refine and purify them  Virgil to give this thought likewise a clothing of poetry describes some spirits as bleaching in the winds others as cleansing under great falls of waters and others  as purging in fire to recover the primitive beauty and purity of their natures  It was likewise an opinion of the same sect of philosophers that the souls of all men exist in a separate state long before their union with the bodies and that upon their immersion into flesh they forget every thing which passed in the state of preexistence so that what we here call knowlege is nothing else but memory or the recovery of those things which we knew before  In pursuance of this scheme Virgil gives us a view of several souls who to prepare themselves for living upon earth flock about the banks of the river Lethe and swill themselves with the waters of oblivion  The same scheme gives him an opportunity of making a noble compliment to his countrymen where Anchises is represented taking a survey of the long train of heroes that are to descend from him and giving his son Aeneas an account of all the glories of his race  I need not mention the revolution of the Platonic year which is but just touched upon in this book and as I have consulted no author's thoughts in this explication shall be very well pleased if it can make the noblest piece of the most accomplished poet more agreeable to my female readers when they think fit to look into Dryden's translation of it  No Thursday April  Aliena negotia curat  Excussus propriis  Hor  From my own apartment  April  THERE lived some years since within my neighbourhood a very grave person an Upholsterer who seemed a man of more than ordinary application to business He was a very early riser and was often abroad two or three hours before any of his neighbours He had a particular  carefulness in the knitting of his brows and a kind of impatience in all his motions that plainly discovered he was always intent on matters of importance Upon my enquiry into his life and conversation I found him to be the greatest newsmonger in our quarter that he rose up before day to read the Postman and that he would take two or three turns to the other end of the town before his neighbours were up to see if there were any Dutch mails come in He had a wife and several children but was much more inquisitive to know what passed in Poland than in his own family and was in greater pain and anxiety of mind for king Augustus's welfare than that of his nearest relations He looked extremely thin in a dearth of news and never enjoyed himself in a westerly wind This indefatigable kind of life was the ruin of his shop for about the time that his favourite prince left the crown of Poland he broke and disappeared  This man and his affairs had been long out of my mind till about three days ago as I was walking in St James's park I heard some body at a distance hemming after me and who should it be but my old neighbour the Upholsterer I saw he was reduced to extreme poverty by certain shabby superfluities in his dress for notwithstanding that it was a very sultry day for the time of the year he wore a loose great coat and a muff with a long campaignwig out of curl to which he had added the ornament of a pair of black garters buckled under the knee Upon his coming up to me I was going to enquire into his present circumstances but was prevented by his asking me with a whisper whether the last letters brought any accounts that one mght rely upon from Bender I told him none that I heard of and asked him whether he had yet married his eldest daughter He told me no But pray says he tell me sincerely what are your thoughts of the king of Sweden for though his wife and children were starving I found his chief concern at present was for this great monarch I told him that I looked upon him as one of the first heroes of the age But pray says he do you  think there is any thing in the story of his wound and finding me surprized at the question Nay says he I only propose it to you I answered that I thought there was no reason to doubt of it But why in the heel says he more than in any other part of the body Because says I the bullet chanced to light there  This extraordinary dialogue was no sooner ended but he began to launch out into a long dissertation upon the affairs of the North and after having spent some time on them he told me he was in a great perplexity how to reconcile the Supplement with the Englishpost and had been just now examining what the other papers say upon the same subject The Dailycourant says he has these words  We have advices from very good hands that a certain prince has some matters of great importance under consideration  This is very mysterious but the Postboy leaves us more in the dark for he tells us  That there are private intimations of measures taken by a certain prince which time will bring to light  Now the Postman says he who uses to be very clear refers to the same news in these words  The late conduct of a certain prince affords great matter of speculation  This certain prince says the upholsterer whom they are all so cautious of naming I take to beUpon which though there was no body near us he whispered something in my ear which I did not hear or think worth my while to make him repeat  We were now got to the upper end of the Mall where were three or four very odd fellows sitting together upon the bench These I found were all of them politicians who used to sun themselves in that place every day about dinnertime Observing them to be curiosities in their kind and my friend's acquaintance I fat down among them  The chief politician of the bench was a great asserter of paradoxes He told us with a seeming concern that by some news he had lately read from Muscovy it appeared to him that there was a storm gathering in the Blacksea which might in time do hurt to the naval forces of  this nation To this he added that for his part he could not wish to see the Turk driven out of Europe which he believed could not but be prejudicial to our woollen manufacture He then told us that he looked upon those extraordinary revolutions which had lately happened in these parts of the world to have risen chiefly from two persons who were not much talked of and those says he are prince Menzikoff and the duchess of Mirandola He backed his assertions with so many broken hints and such a show of depth and wisdom that we gave ourselves up to his opinions  The discourse at length fell upon a point which seldom escapes a knot of trueborn Englishmen whether in case of a religious war the protestants would not be too strong for the papists This we unanimously determined on the protestants side One who sate on my right hand and as I found by his discourse had been in the WestIndies assured us that it would be a very easy matter for the protestants to beat the pope at sea and added that whenever such a war does break out it must turn to the good of the Leeward islands Upon this one who sat at the end of the bench and as I afterwards found was the geographer of the company said that in case the papists should drive the protestants from these parts of Europe when the worst came to the worst it would be impossible to beat them out of Norway and Greenland provided the northern crowns hold together and the Czar of Muscovy stand neuter  He further told us for our comfort that there were vast tracts of land about the pole inhabited neither by protestants nor papists and of greater extent than all the Roman catholic dominions in Europe  When we had fully discussed this point my friend the Upholsterer began to exert himself upon the present negotiations of peace in which he deposed princes settled the bounds of kingdoms and balanced the power of Europe with great justice and impartiality  I at length took my leave of the company and was  going away but had not been gone thirty yards before the Upholsterer hemmed again after me Upon his advancing towards me with a whisper I expected to hear some secret piece of news which he had not thought fit to communicate to the bench but instead of that he desired me in my ear to lend him halfacrown In compassion to so needy a statesman and to dissipate the confusion I found he was in I told him if he pleased I would give him five shillings to receive five pounds of him when the Great Turk was driven out of Constantinople which he very readily accepted but not before he had laid down to me the impossibility of such an event as the affairs of Europe now stand  This paper I design for the particular benefit of those worthy citizens who live more in a coffeehouse than in their shops and whose thoughts are so taken up with the affairs of the allies that they forget their customers  No Saturday April  Sequiturque Patrem non passibus aequis  Virg  From my own apartment  April  WE have already described out of Homer the voyage of Ulysses to the infernal shades with the several adventures that attended it If we look into the beautiful romance published not many years since by the archbishop of Cambray we may see the son of Ulysses bound on the same expedition and after the same manner making his discoveries among the regions of the dead The story of Telemachus is formed altogether in the spirit of Homer and will give an unlearned reader a notion of that great poet's manner of writing more than any translation of him can possibly do As it was written for the instruction of a young prince who may one day sit upon the throne of France the author took care to suit the several parts of his story and particularly the description  we are now entering upon to the character and quality of his pupil For which reason he insists very much on the misery of bad and the happiness of good kings in the account he hath given of punishments and rewards in the other world  We may however observe notwithstanding the endeavours of this great and learned author to copy after the stile and sentiments of Homer that there is a certain tincture of Christianity running through the whole relation The prelate in several places mixes himself with the poet so that his future state puts me in mind of Michael Angelo's last judgment where Charon and his boat are represented as bearing a part in the dreadful solemnities of that great day  Telemachus after having passed through the dark avenues of death in the retinue of Mercury who every day delivers up a certain tale of ghosts to the ferryman of Styx is admitted into the infernal bark Among the companions of his voyage is the shade of Nabopharzon a king of Babylon and tyrant of all the East Among the ceremonies and pomps of his funeral there were four slaves sacrificed according to the custom of the country in order to attend him among the shades The author having described this tyrant in the most odious colours of pride insolence and cruelty tells us that his four slaves instead of serving him after death were perpetually insulting him with reproaches and affronts for his past usage that they spurned him as he lay upon the ground and forced him to show his face which he would fain have covered as lying under all the confusions of guilt and infamy and in short that they kept him bound in a chain in order to drag him before the tribunal of the dead  Telemachus upon looking out of the bark sees all the strand covered with an innumerable multitude of shades who upon his jumping ashore immediately vanished He then pursues his course to the palace of Pluto who is described as seated on his throne in terrible majesty with  Proserpine by his side At the foot of his throne was the pale hideous spectre who by the ghastliness of his visage and the nature of his apparitions that surrounded him discovers himself to be Death His attendants are Melancholy Distrust Revenge Hatred Avarice Despair Ambition Envy Impiety with frightful Dreams and waking Cares which are all drawn very naturally in proper actions and postures The author with great beauty places near his frightful Dreams an assembly of Phantoms which are often employed to terrify the living by appearing in the shape and likeness of the dead  The young hero in the next place takes a survey of the different kinds of criminals that lay in torture among clouds of sulphur and torrents of fire The first of these were such as had been guilty of impieties which every one hath an horror for to which is added a catalogue of such offenders that scarce appear to be faulty in the eyes of the vulgar Among these says the author are malicious critics that have endeavoured to cast a blemish upon the perfections of others with whom he likewise places such as have often hurt the reputation of the innocent by passing a rash judgment on their actions without knowing the occasion of them These crimes says he are more severely punished after death because they generally meet with impunity upon earth  Telemachus after having taken a survey of several other wretches in the same circumstances arrives at that region of torments in which wicked kings are punished There are very fine strokes of imagination in the description which he gives of this unhappy multitude He tells us that on one side of them there stood a revengful Fury thundering in their ears incessant repetitions of all the crimes they had committed upon earth with the aggravations of ambition vanity hardness of heart and all those secret affections of mind that enter into the composition of a tyrant At the same time she holds up to them a large mirror in which every one sees himself represented in the natural horror and deformity of his character  On the other side of them stands another Fury that with an insulting derision repeats to them all the praises that their flatterers had bestowed upon them while they sat upon their respective thrones She too says the author presents a mirror before their eyes in which every one sees himself adorned with all those beauties and perfections in which they had been drawn by the vanity of their own hearts and the flattery of others To punish them for the wantonness or the cruelty which they formerly exercised they are now delivered up to be treated according to the fancy and caprice of several slaves who have here an opportunity of tyrannizing in their turns  The author having given us a description of these ghastly spectres who says he are always calling upon Death and are placed under the distillation of that burning vengeance which falls upon them drop by drop and is never to be exhausted leads us into a pleasing scene of groves filled with the melody of birds and the odours of a thousand different plants These groves are represented as rising among a great many flowery meadows and watered with streams that diffuse a perpetual freshness in the midst of an eternal day and a neverfading spring This says the author was the habitation of those good princes who were friends of the gods and parents of the people Among these Telemachus converses with the shade of one of his ancestors who makes a most agreeable relation of the joys of Elysium and the nature of its inhabitants The residence of Sesostris among these happy shades with his character and present employment is drawn in a very lively manner and with a great elevation of thought  The description of that pure and gentle light which overflows these happy regions and clothes the spirits of these virtuous persons hath something in it of that enthusiasm which this author was accused of by his enemies in the church of Rome but however it may look in religion it makes a very beautiful figure in poetry  The rays of the fun says he are darkness in comparison  with this light which rather deserves the name of glory than that of light It pierces the thickest bodies in the same manner as the sunbeams pass through chrystal it strengthens the sight instead of dazling it and nourishes in the most inward recesses of the mind a perpetual serenity that is not to be expressed It enters and incorporates itself with the very substance of the soul the spirits of the blessed feel it in all their senses and in all their perceptions It produces a certain source of peace and joy that arises in them for ever running through all the faculties and refreshing all the desires of the soul External pleasures and delights with all their charms and allurements are regarded with the utmost indifference and neglect by these happy spirits who have this great principle of pleasure within them drawing the whole mind to itself calling off their attention from the most delightful objects and giving them all the transports of inebriation without the confusion and folly of it  I have here only mentioned some mastertouches of this admirable piece because the original itself is understood by the greater part of my readers I must confess I take a particular delight in these prospects of futurity whether grounded upon the probable suggestions of a fine imagination or the more severe conclusions of philosophy as a man loves to hear all the discoveries or conjectures relating to a foreign country which he is at some time to inhabit Prospects of this nature lighten the burden of any present evil and refresh us under the worst and lowest circumstances of mortality They extinguish in us both the fear and envy of human grandeur Insolence shrinks its head power disappears pain poverty and death fly before them In short the mind that is habitutated to the lively sense of an hereafter can hope for what is the most terrifying to the generality of mankind and rejoice in what is the most afflicting  No Thursday April  Faciunt nae intelligendo ut nihil iutelligant  Ter  From my own apartment  April  TOM FOLIO is a broker in learning employed to get together good editions and stock the libraries of great men There is not a sale of books begins till Tom Folio is seen at the door There is not an auction where his name is not heard and that too in the very nick of time in the critical moment before the last decisive stroke of the hammer There is not a subscription goes forward in which Tom is not privy to the first rough draught of the proposals nor a catalogue printed that doth not come to him wet from the press He is an universal scholar so far as the titlepage of all authors knows the manuscripts in which they were discovered the editions through which they have passed with the praises or censures which they have received from the several members of the learned world He has a greater esteem for Aldus and Elzevir than for Virgil and Horace If you talk of Herodotus he breaks out into a panegyric upon Harry Stephens He thinks he gives you an account of the author when he tells the subject he treats of the name of the editor and the year in which it was printed Or if you draw him into further particulars he cries up the goodness of the paper extols the diligence of the corrector and is transported with the beauty of the letter This he looks upon to be sound learning and substantial criticism As for those who talk of the fineness of stile and the justness of thought or describe the brightness of any particular passages nay though they write themselves in the genius and spirit of the author they admire Tom looks upon them as men of superficial learning and flashy parts  I had yesterday morning a visit from this learning idiot for that is the light in which I consider every pedant  when I discovered in him some little touches of the coxcomb which I had not before observed Being very full of the figure which he makes in the republic of letters and wonderfully satisfied with his great stock of knowlege he gave me broad intimations that he did not believe in all points as his forefathers had done He then communicated to me a thought of a certain author upon a passage of Virgil's account of the dead which I made the subject of a late paper This thought hath taken very much among men of Tom's pitch and understanding though universally exploded by all that know how to construe Virgil or have any relish of antiquity Not to trouble my reader with it I found upon the whole that Tom did not believe a future state of rewards and punishments because Aeneas at his living the empire of the dead passed through the gate of ivory and not through that of horn Knowing that Tom had not sense enough to give up an opinion which he had once received that he might avoid wrangling I told him that Virgil possibly had his oversights as well as another author Ah Mr Bickerstaffe says he you would have another opinion of him if you would read him in Daniel Heinsius's edition I have perused him myself several times in that edition continued he and after the strictest and most malicious examination could find but two faults in him one of them is in the Aeneid where there are two commas instead of a parenthesis and another in the third Georgic where you may find a semicolon turned upside down Perhaps said I these were not Virgil's faults but those of the transcriber I do not design it says Tom as a reflection on Virgil on the contrary I know that all the manuscripts reclaim against such a punctuation Oh Mr Bickerstaffe says he what would a man give to see one simile of Virgil writ in his own hand I asked him which was the simile he meant but was answered any simile in Virgil He then told me all the secret history in the commonwealth of learning of modern pieces that had the names of the ancient authors annexed to them of all  the books that were now writing or printing in the several parts of Europe of many amendments which are made and not yet published and a thousand other particulars which I would not have my memory burdened with for a Vatican  At length being fully persuaded that I thoroughly admired him and looked upon him as a prodigy of learning he took his leave I know several of Tom's class who are professed admirers of Tasso without understanding a word of Italian and one in particular that carries a Pastorfido in his pocket in which I am sure he is acquainted with no other beauty but the clearness of the character  There is another kind of pedant who with all Tom Folio's impertinences hath greater superstructures and embellishments of Greek and Latin and is still more insupportable than the other in the same degree as he is more learned Of this kind very often are editors commentators interpreters scholiasts and critics and in short all men of deep learning without common sense These persons set a greater value on themselves for having found out the meaning of a passage in Greek than upon the author for having written it nay will allow the passage itself not to have any beauty in it at the same time that they would be considered as the greatest men of the age for having interpreted it They will look with contempt upon the most beautiful poems that have been composed by any of their contemporaries but will lock themselves up in their studies for a twelvemonth together to correct publish and expound such trifles of antiquity as a modern author would be contemned for Men of the strictest morals severest lives and the gravest professions will write volumes upon an idle sonnet that is originally in Greek or Latin give editions of the most immoral authors and spin out whole pages upon the various readings of a lewd expression All that can be said in excuse for them is that their works sufficiently shew they have no taste of their authors and that what they do in this kind  is out of their great learning and not out of any levity or lasciviousness of temper  A pedant of this nature is wonderfully well described in six lines of Boileau with which I shall conclude his character  Un pedant enyvre de su vaine science  Tout herisse de Grec tout bouffi d' arrogance  Et qui de mille Auteurs retenus mot pour mot  Dans sa tete entassez n'a souvent fait qu'un sot  Croit qu'un livre fait tout et que sans Aristote  La raison ne voit goute et le bon sens radote  No Tuesday April  From my own apartment  April  A COMMON civility to an impertinent fellow often draws upon one a great many unforeseen troubles and if one doth not take particular care will be interpreted by him as an overture of friendship and intimacy This I was very sensibly of this morning About two hours before day I heard a great rapping at my door which continued some time till my maid could get herself ready to go down and see what was the occasion of it She then brought me up word that there was a gentleman who seemed very much in haste and said he must needs speak with me By the description she gave me of him and by his voice which I could hear as I lay in my bed I fancied him to be my old acquaintance the Upholsterer whom I met the other day in St James'sPark For which reason I bid her tell the gentleman whoever he was that I was indisposed that I could see no body and that if he had any thing to say to me I desired he would leave it in writing My maid after having delivered her message told me that the gentleman said he would stay at the next coffeehouse till I was stirring and bid her be sure to tell me that the French were driven from the Scarp and that Douay was invested He gave her the  name of another town which I found she had dropped by the way  As much as I love to be informed of the success of my brave countrymen I do not care for hearing of a victory before day and was therefore very much out of humour as this unseasonable visit I had no sooner recovered my temper and was falling asleep but I was immediately startled by a second rap and upon my maid's opening the door heard the same voice ask her if her master was yet up And at the same time bid her tell me that he was come on purpose to talk with me about a piece of homenews that every body in the town will be full of two hours hence I ordered my maid as soon as she came into the room without hearing her message to tell the gentleman that whatever his news was I would rather hear it two hours hence than now and that I persisted in my resolution not to speak with any body that morning The wench delivered my answer presently and shut the door It was impossible for me to compose myself to sleep after two such unexpected alarms for which reason I put on my clothes in a very peevish humour I took several turns about my chamber reflecting with a great deal of anger and contempt on these volunteers in politics that undergo all the pain watchfulness and disquiet of a first minister without turning it to the advantage either of themselves or their country and yet it is surprizing to consider how numerous this species of men is There is nothing more frequent than to find a taylor breaking his rest on the affairs of Europe and to see a cluster of porters sitting upon the ministry Our streets swarm with politicians and there is scarce a shop which is not held by a statesman As I was musing after this manner I heard the Upholsterer at the door delivering a letter to my maid and begging her in a very great hurry to give it to her master as soon as ever he was awake which I opened and found as follows  Mr Bickerstaffe  I WAS to wait upon you about a week ago to let you know that the honest gentlemen whom you conversed with upon the bench at the end of the Mall having heard that I had received five shillings of you to give you a hundred pounds upon the Great Turk's being driven out of Europe desired me to acquaint you that every one of that company would be willing to receive five shillings to pay a hundred pounds on the same conditions Our last advices from Muscovy making this a fairer bet than it was a week ago I do not question but you will accept the wager  But this is not my present business If you remember I whispered a word in your ear as we were walking up the Mall and you see what has happened since If I had seen you this morning I would have told you in your ear another secret I hope you will be recovered of your indisposition by tomorrow morning when I will wait on you at the same hour I did this my private circumstances being such that I cannot well appear in this quarter of the town after it is day  I have been so taken up with the late good news from Holland and expectation of further particulars as well as with other transactions of which I will tell you more tomorrow morning that I have not slept a wink these three nights  I have reason to believe that Picardy will soon follow the example of Artois in case the enemy continue in their present resolution of flying away from us I think I told you last time we were together my opinion about the Deulle  The honest gentlemen upon the bench bid me tell you they would be glad to see you often among them We shall be there all the warm hours of the day during the present posture of affairs  This happy opening of the campaign will I hope give us a very joyful summer and I propose to take many a pleasant walk with you if you will sometimes  come into the park for that is the only place in which I can be free from the malice of my enemies Farewel till three o'clock tomorrow morning I am  Your most humble servant  etc  PS  The king of Sweden is still at Bender  I should have fretted myself to death at this promise of a second visit if I had not found in his letter an intimation of the good news which I have since heard at large I have however ordered my maid to ty up the knocker of my door in such a manner as she would do if I was really indisposed By which means I hope to escape breaking my morning's rest  No Thursday April  Nunquam libertas gratior exstat  Quam sub rege pio  From my own apartment  April  I WAS walking two or three days ago in a very pleasing retirement and amusing myself with the reading of that ancient and beautiful allegory called The Table of Cebes I was at last so tired with my walk that I sat down to rest myself upon a bench that stood in the midst of an agreeable shade The music of the birds that filled all the trees about me lulled me asleep before I was aware of it which was followed by a dream that I impute in some measure to the foregoing author who had made an impression upon my imagination and put me into his own way of thinking  I fancied myself among the Alpes and as it is natural in a dream seemed every moment to bound from one summit to another till at last after having made this airy progress over the tops of several mountains I arrived at the very centre of those broken rocks and precipices I here methought saw a prodigious circuit of hills that  reached above the clouds and encompassed a large space of ground which I had a great curiosity to look into I thereupon continued my former way of travelling through a great variety of winter scenes till I had gained the top of these white mountains which seemed another Alpes of snow I looked down from hence into a spacious plain which was surrounded on all sides by this mound of hills and which presented me with the most agreeable prospect I had ever seen There was a greater variety of colours in the embroidery of the meadows a more lively green in the leaves and grass a brighter chrystal in the streams than what I ever met with in any other region The light itself had something more shining and glorious in it than that of which the day is made in other places I was wonderfully astonished at the discovery of such a paradise amidst the wildness of those cold hoary landskips which lay about it but found at length that this happy region was inhabited by the Goddess of Liberty whose presence softened the rigours of the climate enriched the barrenness of the soil and more than supplied the absence of the sun The place was covered with a wonderful profusion of flowers that without being disposed into regular borders and parterres grew promiscuously and had a greater beauty in their natural luxuriancy and disorder than they could have received from the checks and restraints of art There was a river that arose out of the south side of the mountain that by an infinite number of turns and windings seemed to visit every plant and cherish the several beauties of the spring with which the fields abounded After having run to and fro in a wonderful variety of Meanders it at last throws itself into the hollow of a mountain from whence it passes under a long range of rocks and at length rises into that part of the Alpes where the inhabitants think it the first source of the Rhone This river after having made its progress through those free nations stagnates in a huge lake at the leaving of them and no sooner enters into the regions of Slavery  but runs through them with an incredible rapidity and takes its shortest way to the sea  I descended into the happy fields that lay beneath me and in the midst of them beheld the goddess sitting upon a throne She had nothing to enclose her but the bounds of her own dominions and nothing over her head but the heavens Every glance of her eye cast a track of light where it fell that revived the spring and made all things smile about her My heart grew chearful at the sight of her and as she looked upon me I found a certain considence growing in me and such an inward resolution as I never felt before that time  On the left hand of the goddess sat the genius of a commonwealth with the cap of liberty on her head and in her hand a wand like that with which a Roman citizen used to give his slaves their freedom There was something mean and vulgar but at the same time exceeding bold and daring in her air her eyes were full of fire but had in them such casts of sierceness and cruelty as made her appear to me rather dreadful than amiable On her shoulders she wore a mantle on which there was wrought a great confusion of figures As it flew in the wind I could not discern the particular design of them but saw wounds in the bodies of some and agonies in the faces of others and over one part of it could read in letters of blood The Ides of March  On the right hand of the goddess was the genius of monarchy She was clothed in the whitest ermin and wore a crown of the purest gold upon her head In her hand she held a sceptre like that which is born by the British monarchs A couple of tame lions lay crouching at her feet her countenance had in it a very great majesty without any mixture of terror her voice was like the voice of an angel filled with so much sweetness accompanied with such an air of condescension as tempered the awfulness of her appearance and equally inspired love and veneration into the hearts of all that beheld her  In the train of the goddess of liberty were the several Arts and Sciences who all of them flourished underneath her eye One of them in particular made a greater figure than any of the rest who held a thunderbolt in her hand which had the power of melting piercing or breaking every thing that stood in its way The name of this goddess was Eloquence  There were two other dependent goddesses who made a very conspicuous figure in this blissful region The first of them was seated upon an hill that had every plant growing out of it which the soil was in its own nature capable of producing The other was seated in a little island that was covered with groves of spices olives and orangetrees and in a word with the products of every foreign clime The name of the first was Plenty of the second Commerce The first leaned her right arm upon a plough and under her left held a huge horn out of which she poured a whole autumn of fruits The other wore a rostral crown upon her head and kept her eyes fixed upon a compass  I was wonderfully pleased in ranging through this delightful place and the more so because it was not incumbered with fences and enclosures till at length methoughts I sprung from the ground and pitched upon the top of an hill that presented several objects to my sight which I had not before taken notice of The winds that passed over the flowery plain and through the tops of trees which were full of blossoms blew upon me in such a continued breeze of sweets that I was wonderfully charmed with my situation I here saw all the inner declivities of that great circuit of mountains whose outside was covered with snow overgrown with huge forests of firtrees which indeed are very frequently found in other parts of the Alpes These trees were inhabited by storks that came thither in great slights from very distant quarters of the world Methought I was pleased in my dream to see what became of these birds when upon leaving the places to which they make an annual visit they rise in great flocks  so high till they are out of sight and for that reason have been thought by some modern philosophers to take a flight to the moon But my eyes were soon diverted from this prospect when I observed two great gaps that led through this circuit of mountains where guards and watches were posted day and night Upon examination I found that there were two formidable enemies encamped before each of these avenues who kept the place in a perpetual alarm and watched all opportunities of invading it  Tyranny was at the head of one of these armies dressed in an Eastern habit and grasping in her hand an iron sceptre Behind her was Barbarity with the garb and complexion of an Aethiopian Ignorance with a turbant upon her head and Persecution holding up a bloody flag embroidered with flowerdeluces These were followed by Oppression Poverty Famine Torture and a dreadful train of appearances that made me tremble to behold them Among the baggage of this army I could discover racks wheels chains and gibbets with all the instruments art could invent to make human nature miserable  Before the other avenue I saw Licentiousness dressed in a garment not unlike the Polish cassock and leading up a whole army of monsters such as Clamour with a hoarse voice and a hundred tongues Confusion with a misshapen body and a thousand heads Impudence with a forehead of brass and Rapine with hands of iron The tumult noise and uproar in this quarter were so very great that they disturbed my imagination more than is consistent with sleep and by that means awaked me  No Saturday April  Tertius e Coelo cecidit Cato  Juv Sat  From my own apartment  April  IN my younger years I used many endeavours to get a place at court and indeed continued my pursuits till I arrived at my Grand Climacteric but at length altogether despairing of success whether it were for want of capacity friends or due application I at last resolved to erect a new office and for my encouragement to place myself in it For this reason I took upon me the title and dignity of Censor of Great Britain reserving to myself all such perquisites profits and emoluments as should arise out of the discharge of the said office These in truth have not been inconsiderable for besides those weekly contributions which I receive from John Morphew and those annual subscriptions which I propose to myself from the most elegant part of this great island I daily live in a very comfortable affluence of wine stale beer Hungary water beef books and marrowbones which I receive from many welldisposed citizens not to mention the forfeitures which accrue to me from the several offenders that appear before me on courtdays  Having now enjoyed this office for the space of a twelvemonth I shall do what all good officers ought to do take a survey of my behaviour and consider carefully whether I have discharged my duty and acted up to the character with which I am invested For my direction in this particular I have made a narrow search into the nature of the old Roman Censors whom I must always regard not only as my predecessors but as my patterns in this great employment and have several times asked my own heart with great impartiality whether Cato will not bear a more venerable figure among posterity than Bickerstasse  I find the duty of the Roman Censor was twofold  The first part of it consisted in making frequent reviews of the people in casting up their numbers ranging them under their several tribes disposing them into proper classes and subdividing them into their respective centuries  In compliance with this part of the office I have taken many curious surveys of this great city I have collected into particular bodies the Dappers and the Smarts the Natural and Affected Rakes the Pretty fellows and the Very pretty fellows I have likewise drawn out in several distinct parties your Pedants and Men of fire your Gamesters and Politicians I have separated Cits from Citizens Freethinkers from Philosophers Wits from Snufftakers and Duellists from Men of honour I have likewise made a calculation of Esquires not only considering the several distinct swarms of them that are settled in the different parts of this town but also that more rugged species that inhabit the fields and woods and are often found in pothouses and upon haycocks  I shall pass the soft sex over in silence having not yet reduced them into tolerable order as likewise the softer tribe of lovers which will cost me a great deal of time before I shall be able to cast them into their several centuries and subdivisions  The second part of the Roman Censor's office was to look into the manners of the people and to check any growing luxury whether in diet dress or building This duty likewise I have endeavoured to discharge by those wholsome precepts which I have given my countrymen in regard to beef and mutton and the severe censures which I have passed upon ragouts and fricacies There is not as I am informed a pair of red heels to be seen within ten miles of London which I may likewise ascribe without vanity to the becoming zeal which I expressed in that particular I must own my success with the petticoat is not so great but as I have not yet done with it I hope I shall in a little time put an effectual stop to that growing evil As for the article of building I intend hereafter to enlarge upon it having lately observed several  warehouses nay private shops that stand upon Corinthian pillars and whole rows of tin pots shewing themselves in order to their sale through a sashwindow  I have likewise followed the example of the Roman Censors in punishing offences according to the quality of the offender It was usual for them to expel a senator who had been guilty of great immoralities out of the senatehouse by omitting his name when they called over the list of his brethren In the same manner to remove effectually several worthless men who stand possessed of great honours I have made frequent draughts of dead men out of the vicious part of the nobility and given them up to the new society of upholders with the necessary orders for their interment As the Roman Censors used to punish the knights or gentlemen of Rome by taking away their horses from them I have seized the canes of many criminals of figure whom I had just reason to animadvert upon As for the offenders among the common people of Rome they were generally chastised by being thrown out of a higher tribe and placed in one which was not so honourable My reader cannot but think I have had an eye to this punishment when I have degraded one species of men into bombs squibs and crackers and another into drums bassviols and bagpipes not to mention whole packs of delinquents whom I have shut up in kennels and the new hospital which I am at present erecting for the reception of those of my countrymen who give me but little hopes of their amendment on the borders of Moorfields I shall only observe upon this particular that since some late surveys I have taken of this island I shall think it necessary to enlarge the plan of the buildings which I design in this quarter  When my great predecessor Cato the elder stood for the censorship of Rome there were several other competitors who offered themselves and to get an interest among the people gave them great promises of the mild and gentle treatment which they would use towards them  in that office Cato on the contrary told them he presented himself as a candidate because he knew the age was sunk in immorality and corruption and that if they would give him their votes he would promise them to make use of such a strictness and severity of discipline as should recover them out of it The Roman historians upon this occasion very much celebrated the publicspiritedness of that people who chose Cato for their Censor notwithstanding his method of recommending himself I may in some measure extol my own countrymen upon the same account who without any respect to party or any application from myself have made such generous subscriptions for the Censor of Great Britain as will give a magnificence to my oldage and which I esteem more than I would any post in Europe of an hundred times the value I shall only add that upon looking into my catalogue of subscribers which I intend to print alphabetically in the front of my lucubrations I find the names of the greatest beauties and wits in the whole island of Great Britain which I only mention for the benefit of any of them who have not yet subscribed it being my design to close the subscription in a very short time  No Thursday April  Idem inficeto est inficetior rure  Simul poemata attigit neque idem unquam  Aeque est beatus ac poema cum scribit  Tam gaudet in se tamque se ipse miratur  Nimirum idem omnes fallimur neque est quisquam  Quem non in aliqua re videre Suffenum  Possis  Catul de Suffeno  Will's Coffeehouse  April  I YESTERDAY came hither about two hours before the company generally make their appearance with a design to read over all the newspapers but upon my sitting  down I was accosted by Ned Softly who saw me from a corner in the other end of the room where I found he had been writing something Mr Bickerstaffe says he I observe by a late paper of yours that you and I are just of a humour for you must know of all impertinencies there is nothing which I so much hate as news I never read a Gazette in my life and never troubled my head about our armies whether they win or lose or in which part of the world they ly encamped Without giving me time to reply he drew a paper of verses out of his pocket telling me that he had something which would entertain me more agreeably and that he would desire my judgment upon every line for that we had time enough before us till the company came in  Ned Softly is a very pretty poet and a great admirer of easy lines Waller is his favourite and as that admirable writer has the best and worst verses of any among our English poets Ned Softly has got all the bad ones without book which he repeats upon occasion to shew his reading and garnish his conversation Ned is indeed a true English reader incapable of relishing the great and masterly strokes of this art but wonderfully pleased with the little Gothic ornaments of epigrammatical conceits turns points and quibbles which are so frequent in the most admired of our English poets and practised by those who want genius and strength to represent after the manner of the ancients simplicity in its natural beauty and perfection  Finding myself unavoidably engaged in such a conversation I was resolved to turn my pain into a pleasure and to divert myself as well as I could with so very odd a fellow You must understand says Ned that the sonnet I am going to read to you was written upon a lady who shewed me some verses of her own making and is perhaps the best poet of our age But you shall hear it Upon which he begun to read as follows  To Mira on her incomparable poems  I  When dress'd in laurel wreaths you shine  And tune your soft melodious notes  You seem a sister of the nine  Or Phoebus' self in petticoats  II  I fancy when your song you sing  Your song you sing with so much art  Your pen was pluck'd from Cupid's wing  For ah it wounds me like his dart  Why says I this is a little nosegay of conceits a very Jump of salt every verse hath something in it that piques and then the dart in the last line is certainly as pretty a sting in the tail of an epigram for so I think your critics call it as ever entered into the thought of a poet Dear Mr Bickerstaffe says he shaking me by the hand every body knows you to be a judge of these things and to tell you truly I read over Roscommon's translation of Horace's Art of Poetry three several times before I sate down to write the sonnet which I have shewn you But you shall hear it again and pray observe every line of it for not one of them shall pass without your approbation  When dress'd in laurel wreaths you shine  That is says he when you have your garland on when you are writing verses To which I replied I know your meaning a metaphor The same said he and went on  And tune your soft melodious notes  Pray observe the gliding of that verse there is scarce a consonant in it I took care to make it run upon liquids Give me your opinion of it Truly said I I think it as good as the former I am very glad to hear you say so says he but mind the next  You seem a sister of the nine  That is says he you seem a sister of the muses for if you look into ancient authors you will find it was their opinion that there were nine of them I remember it very well said I but pray proceed  Or Phoebus' self in petticoats  Phoebus says he was the god of poetry These little instances Mr Bickerstaffe shew a gentleman's reading Then to take off from the air of learning which Phoebus and the muses have given to this first stanza you may observe how it falls all of a sudden into the familiar  in petticoats  Or Phoebus' self in petticoats  Let us now says I enter upon the second stanza I find the first line is still a continuation of the metaphor  I fancy when your song you sing  It is very right says he but pray observe the turn of words in these two lines I was a whole hour in adjusting of them and have still a doubt upon me whether in the second line it should be  Your song you sing  or  you sing your song  You shall hear them both  I fancy when your song you sing  Your song you sing with so much art  OR  I fancy when your song you sing  You sing your song with so much art  Truly said I the turn is so natural either way that you have made me almost giddy with it Dear Sir said he grasping me by the hand you have a great deal of patience but what do you think of the next verse  Your pen was pluck'd from Cupid's wing  Think says I I think you have made Cupid look like a little goose That was my meaning says he I think the ridicule is well enough hit off But we now come to the last which sums up the whole matter  For ah it wounds me like his dart  Pray how do you like that Ah Doth it not make a pretty figure in that place Ah It looks as if I felt the dart and cried out as being pricked with it  For ah it wounds me like his dart  My friend Dick Easy continued he assured me he would rather have written that Ah than to have been the author of the Aeneid He indeed objected that I made Mira's pen like a quill in one of the lines and like a dart in the other But as to thatOh as to that says I it is but supposing Cupid to be like a porcupine and his quills and darts will be the same thing He was going to embrace me for the hint but half a dozen critics coming into the room whose faces he did not like  he conveyed the sonnet into his pocket and whispered me in the ear he would show it me again as soon as his man had written it over fair  No Saturday April  From my own apartment  April  IT has always been my endeavour to distinguish between realities and appearances and to separate true merit from the pretence to it As it ever shall be my study to make discoveries of this nature in human life and to settle the proper distinctions between the virtues and perfections of mankind and those false colours and resemblances of them that shine alike in the eyes of the vulgar so I shall be more particularly careful to search into the various merits and pretences of the learned world This is the more necessary because there seems to be a general combination among the pedants to extol one another's labours and cry up one another's parts while men of sense either through that modesty which is natural to them or the scorn they have for such trifling commendations enjoy their stock of knowlege like a hidden treasure with satisfaction and silence Pedantry indeed in learning is like hypocrisy in religion a form of knowlege without the power of it that attracts the eyes of the common people breaks out in noise and show and finds its reward not from any inward pleasure that attends it but from the praises and approbations which it receives from men  Of this shallow species there is not a more importunate empty and conceited animal than that which is generally known by the name of a critic This in the common acceptation of the word is one that without entering into the sense and soul of an author has a few general rules which like mechanical instruments he applies to the works of every writer and as they quadrate with them pronounces the author perfect or defective He is master of a certain set of words as unity stile fire  flegm easy natural turn sentiment and the like which he varies compounds divides and throws together in every part of his discourse without any thought or meaning The marks you may know him by are an elevated eye and dogmatical brow a positive voice and a contempt for every thing that comes out whether he has read it or not He dwells altogether in generals He praises or dispraises in the lump He shakes his head very frequently at the pedantry of universities and bursts into laughter when you mention an author that is known at Will's He hath formed his judgment upon Homer Horace and Virgil not from their own works but from those of Rapin and Bossu He knows his own strength so well that he never dares praise any thing in which he has not a French author for his voucher  With these extraordinary talents and accomplishments Sir Timothy Tittle puts men in vogue or condemns them to obscurity and sits as judge of life and death upon every author that appears in public It is impossible to represent the pangs agonies and convulsions which Sir Timothy expresses in every feature of his face and muscle of his body upon the reading of a bad poet  About a week ago I was engaged at a friend's house of mine in an agreeable conversation with his wife and daughters when in the height of our mirth Sir Timothy who makes love to my friend's eldest daughter came in amongst us puffing and blowing as if he had been very much out of breath He immediately called for a chair and desired leave to sit down without any further ceremony I asked him where he had been Whether he was out of order He only replied that he was quite spent and fell a cursing in soliloquy I could hear him cry  A wicked rogueAn execrable wretchwas there ever such a monster  The young ladies upon this began to be affrighted and asked whether any one had hurt him He answered nothing but still talked to himself  To lay the first scene  says he  in St James's Park and the last in Northamptonshire  Is that all says I then I suppose  you have been at the rehearsal of a play this morning Been says he I have been at Northampton in the Park in a lady's bedchamber in a diningroom every where the rogue has led me such a danceThough I could scarce forbear laughing at his discourse I told him I was glad it was no worse and that he was only metaphorically weary In short Sir says he the author has not observed a single unity in his whole play the scene shifts in every dialogue the villain has hurried me up and down at such a rate that I am tired off my legs I could not but observe with some pleasure that the young lady whom he made love to conceived a very just aversion towards him upon seeing him so very passionate in trifles And as she had that natural sense which makes her a better judge than a thousand critics she began to rally him upon this foolish humour For my part says she I never knew a play take that was written up to your rules as you call them How madam says he is that your opinion I am sure you have a better taste It is a pretty kind of magic says she the poets have to transport an audience from place to place without the help of a coach and horses I could travel round the world at such a rate It is such an entertainment as an enchantress finds when she fancies herself in a wood or upon a mountain at a feast or a solemnity though at the same time she has never stirred out of her cottage Your simile madam says Sir Timothy is by no means just Pray says she let my similes pass without a criticism I must confess continued she for I found she was resolved to exasperate him I laughed very heartily at the last new comedy which you found so much fault with But madam says he you ought not to have laughed and I defy any one to show me a single rule that you could laugh by Ought not to laugh says she pray who should hinder me Madam says he there are such people in the world as Rapin Dacier and several others that ought to have spoiled your mirth I have heard says the young lady that your great critics are always very bad poets I  fancy there is as much difference between the works of one and the other as there is between the carriage of a dancingmaster and a gentleman I must confess continued she I would not be troubled with so fine a judgment as yours is for I find you feel more vexation in a bad comedy than I do in a deep tragedy Madam says Sir Timothy that is not my fault they should learn the art of writing For my part says the young lady I should think the greatest art in your writers of comedies is to please To please says Sir Timothy and immediately fell a laughing Truly says she that is my opinion Upon this he composed his countenance looked upon his watch and took his leave  I hear that Sir Timothy has not been at my friend's house since this notable conference to the satisfaction of the young lady who by this means has got rid of a very impertinent fop  I must confess I could not but observe with a great deal of surprize how this gentleman by his illnature folly and affectation hath made himself capable of suffering so many imaginary pains and looking with such a senseless severity upon the common diversions of life  No Saturday July  Tecum vivere amem tecum obeam libens  Hor  From my own apartment  June  SOME years since I was engaged with a coach full of friends to take a journey as far as the Land'send We were very well pleased with one another the first day every one endeavouring to recommend himself by his goodhumour and complaisance to the rest of the company This good correspondence did not last long one of our party was sowred the very first evening by a plate of butter which had not been melted to his mind and which spoiled his temper to such a degree that he continued upon the fret to the end of our journey A second fell off from his goodhumour the next morning for no  other reason I could imagine but because I chanced to step into the coach before him and place myself on the shady side This however was but my own private guess for he did not mention a word of it nor indeed of any thing else for three days following The rest of our company held out very near half the way when of a sudden Mr Sprightly fell asleep and instead of endeavouring to divert and oblige us as he had hitherto done carried himself with an unconcerned careless drowzy behaviour till we came to our last stage There were three of us who still held up our heads and did all we could to make our journey agreeable but to my shame be it spoken about three miles on this side Exeter I was taken with an unaccountable fit of sullenness that hung upon me for above threescore miles whether it were for want of respect or from an accidental tread upon my foot or from a foolish maid's calling me The old Gentleman I cannot tell In short there was but one who kept his goodhumour to the Land'send  There was another coach that went along with us in which I likewise observed that there were many secret jealousies heartburnings and animosities for when we joined companies at night I could not but take notice that the passengers neglected their own company and studied how to make themselves esteemed by us who were altogether strangers to them till at length they grew so well acquainted with us that they liked us as little as they did one another When I reflect upon this journey I often fancy it to be a picture of human life in respect to the several friendships contracts and alliances that are made and dissolved in the several periods of it The most delightful and most lasting engagements are generally those which pass between man and woman and yet upon what trifles are they weakened or entirely broken Sometimes the parties sly asunder even in the midst of courtship and sometimes grow cool in the very honeymonth Some separate before the first child and some after the fifth others continue good till thirty others  till forty while some few whose souls are of an happier make and better fitted to one another travel on together to the end of their journey in a continual intercourse of kind offices and mutual endearments  When we therefore chuse our companions for life if we hope to keep both them and ourselves in good humour to the last stage of it we must be extremely careful in the choice we make as well as in the conduct on our own part When the persons to whom we join ourselves can stand an examination and bear the scrutiny when they mend upon our acquaintance with them and discover new beauties the more we search into their characters our love will naturally rise in proportion to their perfections  But because there are very few possessed of such acomplishments of body and mind we ought to look after those qualifications both in ourselves and others which are indispensably necessary towards this happy union and which are in the power of every one to acquire or at least to cultivate and improve These in my opinion are chearfulness and constancy A chearful temper joined with innocence will make beauty attractive knowlege delightful and with goodnatured It will lighten sickness poverty and affliction convert ignorance into an amiable simplicity and render deformity itself agreeable  Constancy is natural to persons of even tempers and uniform dispositions and may be acquired by those of the greatest fickleness violence and passion who consider seriously the terms of union upon which they come together the mutual interest in which they are engaged with all the motives that ought to incite their tenderness and compassion towards those who have their dependance upon them and are embarked with them for life in the same state of happiness or misery Constancy when it grows in the mind upon considerations of this nature becomes a moral virtue and a kind of goodnature that is not subject to any change of health age fortune or any of those accidents which are apt to unsettle the best dispositions  that are founded rather in constitution than in reason Where such a constancy as this is wanting the most inflamed passion may fall away into coldness and indifference and the most melting tenderness degenerate into hatred and aversion I shall conclude this paper with a story that is very well known in the north of England  About thirty years ago a packetboat that had several passengers on board was cast away upon a rock and in so great danger of sinking that all who were in it endeavoured to save themselves as well as they could though only those who could swim well had a bare possibility of doing it Among the passengers there were two women of fashion who seeing themselves in such a disconsolate condition begged of their husbands not to leave them One of them chose rather to die with his wife than to forsake her the other though he was moved with the utmost compassion for his wife told her that for the good of their children it was better one of them should live than both perish By a great piece of good luck next to a miracle when one of our good men had taken the last and long farewel in order to save himself and the other held in his arms the person that was dearer to him than life the ship was preserved It is with a secret sorrow and vexation of mind that I must tell the sequel of the story and let my reader know that this faithful pair who were ready to have died in each other's arms about three years after their escape upon some trifling disgust grew to a coldness at first and at length fell out to such a degree that they left one another and parted for ever The other couple lived together in an uninterrupted friendship and felicity and what was remarkable the husband whom the shipwreck had like to have separated from his wife died a few months after her not being able to survive the loss of her  I must confess there is something in the changeableness and inconstancy of human nature that very often both dejects and terrifies me Whatever I am at present I tremble to think what I may be While I find this principle  in me how can I assure myself that I shall be always true to my God my friend or myself in short without constancy there is neither love friendship or virtue in the world  No Saturday August  Nugis addere pondus  From my own apartment  August  NATURE is full of wonders every atom is a standing miracle and endowed with such qualities as could not be impressed on it by a power and wisdom less than infinite For this reason I would not discourage any searches that are made into the most minute and trivial parts of the creation However since the world abounds in the noblest fields of speculation it is methinks the mark of a little genius to be wholly conversant among insects reptiles animalcules and those trifling rarities that furnish out the apartment of a virtuoso  There are some men whose heads are so odly turned this way that though they are utter strangers to the common occurrences of life they are able to discover the sex of a cockle or describe the generation of a mite in all its circumstances They are so little versed in the world that they scarce know a horse from an ox but at the same time will tell you with a great deal of gravity that a flea is a rhinoceros and a snail an hermaphrodite I have known one of these whimsical philosophers who has set a greater value upon a collection of spiders than he would upon a flock of sheep and had sold his coat off his back to purchase a tarantula  I would not have a scholar wholly unacquainted with these secrets and curiosities of nature but certainly the mind of man that is capable of so much higher contemplations should not be altogether fixed upon such mean and disproportioned objects Observations of this kind are apt to alienate us too much from the knowlege of  the world and to make us serious upon trifles by which means they expose philosophy to the ridicule of the witty and the contempt of the ignorant In short studies of this nature should be the diversions relaxations and amusements not the care business and concern of life  It is indeed wonderful to consider that there should be a sort of learned men who are wholly employed in gathering together the refuse of nature if I may call it so and hoarding up in their chests and cabinets such creatures as others industriously avoid the sight of One does not know how to mention some of the most precious parts of their treasure without a kind of an apology for it I have been shewn a beetle valued at twenty crowns and a toad at an hundred but we must take this for a general rule that whatever appears trivial or obscene in the common notions of the world looks grave and philosophical in the eye of a virtuoso  To shew this humour in its perfection I shall present my reader with the legacy of a certain virtuoso who laid out a considerable estate in natural rarities and curiosities which upon his deathbed he bequeathed to his relations and friends in the following words  The will of a virtuoso  I Nicholas Gimcrack being in sound health of mind but in great weakness of body do by this my last will and testament bestow my worldly goods and chattels in manner following  Imprimis  To my dear wife  One box of butterflies  One drawer of shells  A female skeleton  A dried cockatrice  Item  To my daughter Elizabeth  My receipt for preserving dead caterpillars  As also my preparations of winter Maydew and Embrio pickle  Item  To my little daughter Fanny  Three crocodile's eggs  And upon the birth of her first child if she marries with her mother's consent  The nest of an hummingbird  Item  To my eldest brother as an acknowlegement for the lands he hath vested in my son Charles I bequeath  My last year's collection of grashoppers  Item  To his daughter Susanna being his only child I bequeath my  English weeds pasted on royal paper  With my large Folio of Indian cabbage  Item  To my learned and worthy

pizzle  To him and his issue male and in default of such issue in the said Dr Elscrickius then to return to my executor and his heirs for ever  Having fully provided for my nephew Isaac by making over

disrespectfully of his little sister whom I keep by me in spirits of wine and in many other instances behaved himself undutifully towards me I do disinherit and wholly cut off from any part of this my personal estate by giving him a single cockle shell  To my second son Charles I give and bequeath all my  flowers plants minerals mosses shells pebbles fossils beetles butterflies caterpillars grashoppers and vermin not above specified as also all my monsters both wet and dry making the said Charles whole and sole executor of this my last will and testament he paying or causing to be paid

at that time but continues so to this present day  Beware of counterfeits for such are abroad  No Thursday August  Scriptorum Chorus omnis amat nemus et fugit urbes  Hor  From my own apartment  August  I CHANCED to rise very early one particular morning this summer and took a walk into the country to divert myself among the fields and meadows while the green was new and the flowers in their bloom As at this season of the year every lane is a beautiful walk and every hedge full of nosegays I lost myself with a great deal of pleasure among several thickets and bushes that were filled with a great variety of birds and an agreeable confusion of notes which formed the pleasantest scene in the world to one who had passed a whole winter in noise and smoke The freshness of the dews that lay upon every thing about me with the cool breath of the morning which inspired the birds with so many delightful instincts created in me the same kind of animal pleasure  and made my heart overflow with such secret emotions of joy and satisfaction as are not to be described or accounted for On this occasion I could not but reflect upon a beautiful simile in Milton  As one who long in populous city pent  Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air  Forth issuing on a summer's morn to breathe  Among the pleasant villages and farms  Adjoin'd from each thing met conceives delight  The smell of grain or tedded grass or kine  Or dairy each rural sight each rural sound  Those who are conversant in the writings of polite authors receive an additional entertainment from the country as it revives in their memories those charming descriptions with which such authors do frequently abound  I was thinking of the foregoing beautiful simile in Milton and applying it to myself when I observed to the windward of me a black cloud falling to the earth in long trails of rain which made me betake myself for shelter to a house which I saw at a little distance from the place where I was walking As I sat in the porch I heard the voices of two or three persons who seemed very earnest in discourse My curiosity was raised when I heard the names of Alexander the Great and Artaxerxes and as their talk seemed to run on ancient heroes I concluded there could not be any secret in it for which reason I thought I might very fairly listen to what they said  After several parallels between great men which appeared to me altogether groundless and chimerical I was surprized to hear one say that he valued the Black Prince more than the duke of Vendosme How the duke of Vendosme should become a rival of the Black Prince's I could not conceive and was more startled when I heard a second affirm with great vehemence that if the emperor of Germany was not going off he should like him better  than either of them He added That though the season was so changeable the duke of Marlborough was in bloming beauty I was wondering to myself from whence they had received this odd intelligence especially when I heard them mention the names of several other great generals as the prince of Hesse and the king of Sweden who they said were both running away To which they added what I entirely agreed with them in that the crown of France was very weak but that the mareschal Villars still kept his colours At last one of them told the company if they would go along with him he would shew them a chimneysweeper and a painted lady in the same bed which he was sure would very much please them The shower which had driven them as well as myself into the house was now over and as they were passing by me into the garden I asked them to let me be one of their company  The gentleman of the house told me If I delighted in flowers it would be worth my while for that he believed he could shew me such a blow of tulips as was not to be matched in the whole country  I accepted the offer and immediately found that they had been talking in terms of gardening and that the kings and generals they had mentioned were only so many tulips to which the gardeners according to their usual custom had given such high titles and appellations of honour  I was very much pleased and astonished at the glorious show of these gay vegetables that arose in great profusion on all the banks about us Sometimes I considered them with the eye of an ordinary spectator as so many beautiful objects varnished over with a natural gloss and stained with such a variety of colours as are not to be equalled in any artificial dyes or tinctures Sometimes I considered every leaf as an elaborate piece of tissue in which the threads and fibres were woven together into different configurations which gave a different colouring to the light as it glanced on the several parts of the surface  Sometimes I considered the whole bed of tulips according to the notion of the greatest mathematician and philosopher that ever lived as a multitude of optic instruments designed for the separating light into all those various colours of which it is composed  I was awakened out of these my philosophical speculations by observing the company often seemed to laugh at me I accidentally praised a tulip as one of the finest that I ever saw upon which they told me it was a common fool'scoat Upon that I praised a second which it seems was but another kind of fool'scoat I had the same fate with two or three more for which reason I desired the owner of the garden to let me know which were the finest of the flowers for that I was so unskilful in the art that I thought the most beautiful were the most valuable and that those which had the gayest colours were the most beautiful The gentleman smiled at my ignorance he seemed a very plain honest man and a person of good sense had not his head been touched with that distemper which Hippocrates calls the TulippoMania  insomuch that he would talk very rationally on any subject in the world but a tulip  He told me that he valued the bed of flowers which lay before us and was not above twenty yards in length and two in breadth more than he would the best hundred acres of land in England and added that it would have been worth twice the money it is if a foolish cookmaid of his had not almost ruined him the last winter by mistaking an handful of tuliproots for an heap of onions and by that means says he made me a dish of pottage that cost me above l sterling He then shewed me what he thought the finest of his tulips which I found received all their value from their rarity and oddness and put me in mind of your great fortunes which are not always the greatest beauties  I have often looked upon it as a piece of happiness that I have never fallen into any of these fantastical tastes nor esteemed any thing the more for its being uncommon  and hard to be met with For this reason I look upon the whole country in springtime as a spacious garden and make as many visits to a spot of daisies or a bank of violets as a florist does to his borders and parterres There is not a bush in blossom within a mile of me which I am not acquainted with nor scarce a daffadil or cowslip that withers away in my neighbourhood without my missing it I walked home in this temper of mind through several fields and meadows with an unspeakable pleasure not without reflecting on the bounty of providence which has made the most pleasing and most beautiful objects the most ordinary and most common  No Tuesday September  Insani sanus nomen serat aequus iniqui  Ultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam  Hor  From my own apartment  September  HAVING received many letters filled with compliments and acknowlegements for my late useful discovery of the political barometer I shall here communicate to the public an account of my ecclesiastical thermometer the latter giving as manifest prognostications of the changes and revolutions in church as the former does of those in state and both of them being absolutely necessary for every prudent subject who is resolved to keep what he has and get what he can  The church thermometer which I am now to treat of is supposed to have been invented in the reign of Henry the eighth about the time when that religious prince put some to death for owning the pope's supremacy and others for denying transubstantiation I do not find however any great use made of this instrument till it fell into the hands of a learned and viligant priest or minister for he frequently wrote himself both one and the other who was some time vicar of Bray This gentleman lived in  his vicarage to a good old age and after having seen several successions of his neighbouring clergy either burnt or banished departed this life with the satisfaction of having never deserted his flock and died vicar of Bray As this glass was first designed to calculate the different degrees of heat in religion as it raged in popery or as it cooled and grew temperate in the reformation it was marked at several distances after the manner our ordinary thermometer is to this day  viz Extreme hot Sultry hot Very hot Hot Warm Temperate Cold Just freezing Frost Hard frost Great frost Extreme cold  It is well known that Torricellius the inventor of the common weatherglass made the experiment in a long tube which held thirtytwo foot of water and that a more modern virtuoso finding such a machine altogether unwieldy and useless and considering that thirtytwo inches of quicksilver weighed as much as so many foot of water in a tube of the same circumference invented that sizeable instrument which is now in use After this manner that I might adapt the thermometer I am now speaking of to the present constitution of our church as divided into High and Low I have made some necessary variations both in the tube and the fluid it contains In the first place I ordered a tube to be cast in a planetary hour and took care to seal it hermetically when the sun was in conjunction was Saturn I then took the proper precautions about the fluid which is a compound of two very different liquors one of them a spirit drawn out of a strong heady wine the other a particular sort of rockwater colder than ice and clearer than crystal The spirit is of a red fiery colour and so very apt to ferment that unless it be mingled with a proportion of the water or pent up very close it will burst the vessel that holds it and fly up in fume and smoke The water on the contrary is of such a subtle piercing cold that unless it be mingled with a proportion of the spirits it will sink through almost every thing that it is put into and seems to be of the same nature as the water mentioned by  Quintus Curtius which says the historian could be contained in nothing but in the hoof or as the Oxford manuscript has it in the skull of an ass The thermometer is marked according to the following figure which I set down at length not only to give my reader a clear idea of it but also to fill up my paper  Ignorance  Persecution  Wrath  Zeal  CHURCH  Moderation  Lukewarmness  Insidelity  Ignorance  The reader will observe that the church is placed in the middle point of the glass between Zeal and Moderation the situation in which she always flourishes and in which every good Englishman wishes her who is a friend to the constitution of his country However when it mounts to Zeal it is not amiss and when it sinks to Moderation is still in a most admirable temper The worst of it is that when once it begins to rise it has still an inclination to ascend insomuch that it is apt to climb from Zeal to Wrath and from Wrath to Persecution which always ends in Ignorance and very often proceeds from it In the same manner it frequently takes its progress through the lower half of the glass and when it has a tendency to fall will gradually descend from Moderation to Lukewarmness and from Lukewarmness to Insidelity which very often terminates in Ignorance and always proceeds from it  It is a common observation that the ordinary thermometer will be affected by the breathing of people who are in the room where it stands and indeed it is almost incredible to conceive how the glass I am now describing will fall by the breath of a multitude crying Popery or on  on the contrary how it will rise when the same multitude as it sometimes happens cry out in the same breath  the Church is in danger  As soon as I had finished this my glass and adjusted it to the abovementioned scale of religion that I might make proper experiments with it I carried it under my cloak to several coffeehouses and other places of resort about this great city At St James's coffeehouse the liquor stood at Moderation but at Wills's to my extreme surprize it subsided to the very lowest mark on the glass At the Grecian it mounted but just one point higher at the Rainbow it still ascended two degrees Child's fetched it up to Zeal and other adjacent coffeehouses to Wrath  It fell into the lower half of the glass as I went further into the city till at length it settled at Moderation where it continued all the time I stayed about the Change as also whilst I passed by the Bank And here I cannot but take notice that through the whole course of my remarks I never observed my glass to rise at the same time that the stocks did  To complete the experiment I prevailed upon a friend of mine who works under me in the occult sciences to make a progress with my glass through the whole island of Great Britain and after his return to present me with a register of his observations I guessed beforehand at the temper of several places he passed through by the characters they have had time out of mind Thus that facetious divine Dr Fuller speaking of the town of Banbury near a hundred years ago tells us it was a place famous for cakes and Zeal which I find by my glass is true to this day as to the latter part of this description though I must confess it is not in the same reputation for cakes that it was in the time of that learned author and thus of other places In short I have now by me digested in an alphabetical order all the counties corporations and boroughs in Great Britain with their respective tempers as they stand related to my thermometer  but this I shall keep to myself because I would by no means do any thing that may seem to influence any ensuing elections  The point of doctrine which I would propagate by this my invention is the same which was long ago advanced by that able teacher Horace out of whom I have taken my text for this discourse we should be careful not to overshoot ourselves in the pursuits even of virtue Whether Zeal or Moderation be the point we aim at let us keep fire out of the one and frost out of the other But alas the world is too wise to want such a precaution The terms High Church and Low Church as commonly used do not so much denote a principle as they distinguish a party They are like words of battle that have nothing to do with their original signification but are only given out to keep a body of men together and to let them know friends from enemies  I must confess I have considered with some little attention the influence which the opinions of these great national sects have upon their practice and do look upon it as one of the unaccountable things of our times that multitudes of honest gentlemen who entirely agree in their lives should take it in their heads to differ in their religion  No Thursday September  Materiam superabat opus  Ovid  From my own apartment  September  IT is my custom in a dearth of news to entertain myself with those collections of advertisements that appear at the end of all our public prints These I consider as accounts of news from the little world in the same manner that the foregoing parts of the paper are from the great If in one we hear that a sovereign prince is fled from his capital city in the other we hear of a tradesman who hath shut up his shop and run away If in one we find  the victory of a general in the other we see the desertion of a private soldier I must confess I have a certain weakness in my temper that is often very much affected by these little domestic occurrences and have frequently been caught with tears in my eyes over a melancholy advertisement  But to consider this subject in its most ridiculous lights advertisements are of great use to the vulgar first of all as they are instruments of ambition A man that is by no means big enough for the Gazette may easily creep into the advertisements by which means we often see an apothecary in the same paper of news with a plenipotentiary or a runningfootman with an ambassador An advertisement from Pickadilly goes down to posterity with an article from Madrid and John Bartlett of Goodman's Fields is celebrated in the same paper with the emperor of Germany Thus the fable tells us that the wren mounted as high as the eagle by getting upon his back  A second use which this sort of writings have been turned to of late years has been the management of controversy insomuch that above half the advertisements one meets with nowadays are purely polemical The inventors of Strops for Razors have written against one another this way for several years and that with great bitterness as the whole argument  pro  and  con  in the case of the Morning Gowns is still carried on after the same manner I need not mention the several proprietors of Dr Anderson's pills nor take notice of the many satirical works of this nature so frequently published by Dr Clark who has had the confidence to advertise upon that learned knight my very worthy friend Sir William Read But I shall not interpose in their quarrel Sir William can give him his own in advertisements that in the judgment of the impartial are as well penned as the doctor's  The third and last use of these writings is to inform the world where they may be furnished with almost every  thing that is necessary for life If a man has pains in his head cholics in his bowels or spots in his clothes he may here meet with proper cures and remedies If a man would recover a wife or a horse that is stolen or strayed if he wants new sermons electuaries asses milk or any thing else either for his body or his mind this is the place to look for them in  The great art in writing advertisements is the finding out a proper method to catch the reader's eye without which a good thing may pass over unobserved or be lost among commissions of bankrupt Asterisks and hands were formerly of great use for this purpose Of late years the  NB  has been much in fashion as also little cuts and figures the invention of which we must ascribe to the author of springtrusses I must not here omit the blind Italian character which being scarce legible always fixes and detains the eye and gives the curious reader something like the satisfaction of prying into a secret  But the great skill in an advertiser is chiefly seen in the stile which he makes use of He is to mention  the universal esteem or general reputation  of things that were never heard of If he is a physician or astrologer he must change his lodgings frequently and though he never saw any body in them besides his own family give public notice of it  For the information of the nobility and gentry  Since I am thus usefully employed in writing criticisms on the works of these diminutive authors I must not pass over in silence an advertisement which has lately made its appearance and is written altogether in the Ciceronian manner It was sent to me with five shillings to be inserted among my advertisements but as it is a pattern of good writing in this way I shall give it a place in the body of my paper  THE highest compound spirit of lavender the most glorious if the expression may be used enlivening scent and flavour that can possibly be which so raptures the spirits delights the gust and gives such airs to the countenance  as are not to be imagined but by those that have tried it The meanest sort of the thing is admired by most gentlemen and ladies but this far more as by far it exceeds it to the gaining among all a more than common esteem It is sold in neat flint bottles fit for the pocket only at the Goldenkey in Wharton'scourt near Holbornbars for s d with directions  At the same time that I recommend the several flowers in which this spirit of lavender is wrapped up if the expression may be used I cannot excuse my fellowlabourers for admitting into their papers several uncleanly advertisements not at all proper to appear in the works of polite writers Among these I must reckon the Carminitive Windexpelling pills If the doctor had called them his carminitive pills he had done as cleanly as any one could have wished but the second word entirely destroys the decency of the first There are other absurdities of this nature so very gross that I dare not mention them and shall therefore dismiss this subject with a public admonition to Michael Parrot that he do not presume any more to mention a certain worm he knows of which by the way has grown seven foot in my memory for if I am not much mistaken it is the same that was but nine foot long about six months ago  By the remarks I have here made it plainly appears that a collection of advertisements is a kind of miscellany the writers of which contrary to all authors except men of quality give money to the booksellers who publish their copies The genius of the bookseller is chiefly shewn in his method of ranging and digesting these little tracts The last paper I took up in my hands places them in the following order  The true Spanish blacking for shoes  etc  The beautifying cream for the face  etc  Pease and plaisters  etc  Nectar and ambrosia  etc  Four freehold tenements of l per annum  etc  {inverted ⁂}The present state of England  etc  †{inverted †}†Annotations upon the Tatler  etc  A commission of bankrupt being awarded against  B L  Bookseller  etc  No Saturday September  Juvenis quondam nunc Foemina Caeneus  Rursus et in veterem fato revoluto figuram  Virg  From my own apartment  September  IT is one of the designs of this paper to transmit to posterity an account of every thing that is monstrous in my own times For this reason I shall here publish to the world the life of a person who was neither man nor woman as written by one of my ingenious correspondents who seems to have imitated Plutarch in that multifarious erudition and those occasional dissertations which he has wrought into the body of his history The life I am putting out is that of Margery alias John Young commonly known by the name of Dr Young who as the town very well knows was a woman that practised physic in man's clothes and after having had two wives and several children died about a month since  SIR  I HERE make bold to trouble you with a short account of the famous doctor Young's life which you may call if you please a second part of the farce of the Sham Doctor This perhaps will not seem so strange to you who if I am not mistaken have some where mentioned with honour your sister Kirleus as a practitioner both in physic and astrology but in the common opinion of mankind a Shequack is altogether as strange and astonishing a creature as a centaur that practised physic in the days of Achilles or as king Phys in the Rehearsal Aesculapius the great founder of your  art was particularly famous for his beard as we may conclude from the behaviour of a tyrant who is branded by heathen historians as guilty both of sacrilege and blasphemy having robbed the statue of Aesculapius of a thick bushy golden beard and then alleged for his excuse  That it was a shame that the son should have a beard when his father Apollo had none  This latter instance indeed seems something to favour a female professor since as I have been told the ancient statues of Apollo are generally made with the head and face of a woman nay I have been credibly informed by those who have seen them both that the famous Apollo in the Belvidera did very much resemble Dr Young Let that be as it will the doctor was a kind of Amazon in physic that made as great devastations and slaughters as any of our chief heroes in the art and was as fatal to the English in these our days as the famous Joan d' Arc was in those of our forefathers  I do not find any thing remarkable in the life I am about to write till the year at which time the doctor being about twentythree years old was brought to bed of a bastard child The scandal of such a misfortune gave so great uneasiness to pretty Mrs Peggy for that was the name by which the doctor was then called that she left her family and followed her lover to London with a fixed resolution some way or other to recover her lost reputation but instead of changing her life which one would have expected from so good a disposition of mind she took it in her head to change her sex This was soon done by the help of a sword and a pair of breeches I have reason to believe that her first design was to turn manmidwife having herself had some experience in those affairs but thinking this too narrow a foundation for her future fortune she at length bought her a gold button coat and set up for a physician Thus we see the same fatal miscarriage in her youth made Mrs Young a doctor that formerly made one of the same sex a pope  The doctor succeeded very well in his business at first but very often met with accidents that disquieted him As he wanted that deep magisterial voice which gives authority to a prescription and is absolutely necessary for the right pronouncing of those words  Take these pills  he unfortunately got the nickname of the Squeaking Doctor If this circumstance alarmed the Doctor there was another that gave him no small disquiet and very much diminished his gains In short he found himself run down as a superficial prating quack in all families that had at the head of them a cautious father or a jealous husband These would often complain among one another that they did not like such a smockfaced physician though in truth had they known how justly he deserved that name they would rather have favoured his practice than have apprehended any thing from it  Such were the motives that determined Mrs Young to change her condition and take in marriage a virtuous young woman who lived with her in good reputation and made her the father of a very pretty girl But this part of her happiness was soon after destroyed by a distemper which was too hard for our physician and carried off his wife The doctor had not been a widow long before he married his second lady with whom also he lived in a very good understanding It so happened that the doctor was with child at the same time that his lady was but the little ones coming both together they passed for twins The doctor having entirely established the reputation of his manhood especially by the birth of the boy of whom he had been lately delivered and who very much resembles him grew into good business and was particularly famous for the cure of venereal distempers but would had much more practice among his own sex had not some of them been so unreasonable as to demand certain proofs of their cure which the doctor was not able to give them The florid blooming look which  gave the doctor some uneasiness at first instead of betraying his person only recommended his physic Upon this occasion I cannot forbear mentioning what I thought a very agreeable surprize in one of Moliere's plays where a young woman applies herself to a sick person in the habit of a quack and speaks to her patient who was something scandalized at the youth of his physician to the following purpose  I begun to practise in the reign of Francis  I  and am now in the hundred and fiftieth year of my age but by the virtue of my medicaments have maintained myself in the same beauty and freshness I had at fifteen  For this reason Hippocrates lays it down as a rule that a student in physic should have a sound constitution and a healthy look which indeed seems as necessary qualifications for a physician as a good life and virtuous behaviour for a divine But to return to our subject About two years ago the doctor was very much afflicted with the vapours which grew upon him to such a degree that about six weeks since they made an end of him His death discovered the disguise he had acted under and brought him back again to his former sex It is said that at his burial the pall was held up by six women of some fashion The doctor left behind him a widow and two fatherless children if they may be called so besides the little boy before mentioned In relation to whom we may say of the doctor as the good old ballad about  the children in the wood  says of the unnatural uncle that he was father and mother both in one These are all the circumstrnces that I could learn of doctor Young's life which might have given occasion to many obscene fictions but as I know those would never have gained a place in your paper I have not troubled you with any impertinence of that nature having stuck to the truth very scrupulously as I always do when I subscribe myself  SIR  Your  c  I shall add as a postscript to this letter that I am informed the famous Saltero who sells coffee in his musaeum at Chelsea has by him a curiosity which helped the doctor to carry on his imposture and will give great satisfaction to the curious inquirer  No Tuesday September  Quaesitam meritis sume superbiam  Hor  From my own apartment  September  THE whole creation preys upon itself every living creature is inhabited A slea has a thousand invisible insects that teaze him as he jumps from place to place and revenge our quarrels upon him A very ordinary microscope shews us that a louse is itself a very lousy creature A whale besides those seas and oceans in the several vessels of his body which are filled with innumerable shoals of little animals carries about it a whole world of inhabitants insomuch that if we believe the calculations some have made there are more living creatures which are too small for the naked eye to behold about the leviathan than there are of visible creatures upon the face of the whole earth Thus every nobler creature is as it were the basis and support of multitudes that are his inferiors  This consideration very much comforts me when I think on those numberless vermin that feed upon this paper and find their sustenance out of it I mean the small wits and scribblers that every day turn a penny by nibbling at my lucubrations This has been so advantageous to this little species of writers that if they do me justice I may expect to have my statue erected in Grubstreet as being a common benefactor to that quarter  They say when a fox is very much troubled with fleas he goes into the next pool with a little lock of wool in his mouth and keeps his body under water till the vermin  get into it after which he quits the wool and diving leaves his tormentors to shift for themselves and get their livelihood where they can I would have these gentlemen take care that I do not serve them after the same manner for though I have hitherto kept my temper pretty well it is not impossible but I may some time or other disappear and what will then become of them Should I lay down my paper what a famine would there be among the hawkers printers booksellers and authors it would be like Dr Bs's dropping his cloak with the whole congregation hanging upon the skirts of it To enumerate some of these my doughty antagonists I was threatened to be answered weekly Tit for Tat I was undermined by the Whisperer haunted by Tom Brown's Ghost scolded at by a Female Tatler and slandered by another of the same character under the title of Atalantis I have been  annotated retattled examined  and  condoled  but it being my standing maxim never to speak ill of the dead I shall let these authors rest in peace and take great pleasure in thinking that I have sometimes been the means of their getting a bellyfull When I see myself thus surrounded by such formidable enemies I often think of the knight of the Red Cross in Spenser's Den of Error who after he has cut off the dragon's head and lest it wallowing in a flood of ink sees a thousand monstrous reptiles making their attempts upon him one with many heads another with none and all of them without eyes  The same so sore annoyed has the knight  That well nigh choked with the deadly stink  His forces fail he can no longer fight  Whose courage when the fiend perceiv'd to shrink  She poured forth out of her hellish sink  Her fruitful cursed spawn of serpents small  Deformed monsters foul and black as ink  Which swarming all about his legs did crall  And him encombred sore but could not hurt at all  As gentle shepherd in sweet eventide  When ruddy Phaebus gins to welk in west  High on an hill his flock to viewen wide  Marks which do bite their hasty supper best  A cloud of combrous gnats do him molest  All striving to infix their feeble stings  That from their noyance he no where can rest  But with his clownish hands their tender wings  He brusheth oft and oft doth mar their murmurings  If ever I should want such a fry of little authors to attend me I shall think my paper in a very decaying condition They are like ivy about an oak which adorns the tree at the same time that it eats it or like a great man's equipage that do honour to the person on whom they feed For my part when I see myself thus attacked I do not consider my antagonists as malicious but hungry and therefore am resolved never to take any notice of them  As for those who detract from my labours without being prompted to it by an empty stomach in return to their censures I shall take pains to excel and never fail to persuade myself that their enmity is nothing but their envy or ignorance  Give me leave to conclude like an old man and a moralist with a fable  The owls bats and several other birds of night were one day got together in a thick shade where they abused their neighbours in a very sociable manner This satire at last fell upon the sun whom they all agreed to be very troublesome impertinent and inquisitive Upon which the sun who overheard them spoke to them after this manner Gentlemen I wonder how you dare abuse one that you know could in an instant scorch you up and burn every mother's son of you but the only answer I shall give you or the revenge I shall take of you is to  shine on  No Thursday October  Mecum certasse feretur  Ovid  From my own apartment  October  IT is ridiculous for any man to criticise on the works of another who has not distinguished himself by his own performances A judge would make but an indifferent figure who had never been known at the bar Cicero was reputed the greatest orator of his age and country before he wrote a book De Oratore and Horace the greatest poet before he published his Art of Poetry The observation arises naturally in any one who casts his eye upon this last mentioned author where he will find the criticisms placed in the latter end of his book that is after the finest odes and satires in the Latin tongue  A modern whose name I shall not mention because I would not make a silly paper sell was born a critic and an examiner and like one of the race of the serpent's teeth came into the world with a sword in his hand His works put me in mind of the story that is told of a German monk who was taking a catalogue of a friend's library and meeting with a Hebrew book in it entered it under the title of  A book that has the beginning where the end should be  This author in the last of his crudities has amassed together a heap of quotations to prove that Horace and Virgil were both of them modester men than myself and if his works were to live as long as mine they might possibly give posterity a notion that Isaac Bickerstaffe was a very conceited old fellow and as vain a man as either Tully or Sir Francis Bacon Had this serious writer fallen upon me only I could have overlooked it but to see Cicero abused is I must confess what I cannot bear The censure he passes upon this great man runs thus  The itch of being very abusive is almost inseparable from vainglory Tully has these two faults in so high a degree that nothing but his being the best writer  in the world can make amends for them  The scurrilous wretch goes on to say I am as bad as Tully His words are these  and yet the Tatler in his paper of September    th has out done him in both He speaks of himself with more arrogance and with more insolence of others  I am afraid by his discourse this gentleman has no more read Plutarch than he has Tully If he had he would have observed a passage in that historian wherein he has with great delicacy distinguished between two passions which are usually complicated in human nature and which an ordinary writer would not have thought of separating Not having my Greek spectacles by me I shall quote the passage word for word as I find it translated to my hand  Nevertheless though he was intemperately fond of his own praise yet he was very free from envying others and most liberally profuse in commending both the antients and his contemporaries as is to be understood by his writings and many of those sayings are still recorded as that concerning Aristotle that he was a river of flowing gold of Plato's dialogue that if Jupiter were to speak he would discourse as he did Theophrastus he was wont to call his peculiar delight and being asked which of Demosthenes's orations he liked best He answered the longest  And as for eminent men of his own time either for eloquence or philosophy there was not one of them whom he did not by writing or speaking favourably of render more illustrious  Thus the critic tells us That Cicero was excessively vainglorious and abusive Plutarch that he was vain but not abusive Let the reader believe which of them he pleases  After this he complains to the world that I call him names and that in my passion I said He was a Flea a Louse an Owl a Bat a small Wit a Scribler and a Nibler When he has thus bespoken his reader's pity he falls into that admirable vein of mirth which I shall set down at length it being an exquisite piece of raillery and written in great gaiety of heart  After this list of names    viz  Flea Louse Owl Bat  etc    I was surprised  to hear him say that he has hitherto kept his temper pretty well I wonder how he will write when he has lost his temper I suppose as he now is very angry and unmannerly he will then be exceeding courteous and goodhumoured  If I can outlive this raillery I shall be able to bear any thing  There is a method of criticism made use of by this author for I shall take care how I call him a scribler again which may turn into ridicule any work that was ever written wherein there is a variety of thoughts this the reader will observe in the following words  He  meaning me  is so intent upon being something extraordinary that he scarce knows what he would be and is as fruitful in his similes as a brother of his whom I lately took notice of In the compass of a few lines he compares himself to a fox to Daniel Burgess to the knight of the red cross to an oak with ivy about it and to a great man with an equipage  I think myself as much honoured by being joined in this part of his paper with the gentleman whom he here calls my brother as I am in the beginning of it by being mentioned with Horace and Virgil  It is very hard that a man cannot publish ten papers without stealing from himself but to shew you that this is only a knack of writing and that the author is got into a certain road of criticism I shall set down his remarks on the works of the gentleman whom he here glances upon as they stand in his th paper and desire the reader to compare them with the foregoing passage upon mine  In thirty lines his patron is a river the Primum Mobile a pilot a victim the sun any thing and nothing He bestows increase conceals his source makes the machine move teaches to steer expiates our offences raises vapours and looks larger as he sets  What poem can be safe from this sort of criticism I think I was never in my life so much offended as at a wag whom I once met with in a coffeehouse he had in his hand one of the miscellanies and was reading the following short copy of verses which without flattery to  the author is I think as beautiful in its kind as any one in the English tongue  Flavia the least and slightest toy  Can with resistless art employ  This fan in meaner hands would prove  An engine of small force in love  But she with such an air and mein  Not to be told or safely seen  Directs its wanton motions so  That it wounds more than Cupid's bow  Gives coolness to the matchless dame  To every other breast a flame  When this coxcomb had done reading them heyday says he what instrument is this that Flavia employs in such a manner as is not to be told or safely seen In ten lines it is a toy a Cupid's bow a fan and an engine in love It has wanton motions it wounds it cools and inflames  Such criticisms make a man of sense sick and a fool merry  The next paragraph of the paper we are talking of falls upon some body whom I am at a loss to guess at but I find the whole invective turns upon a man who it seems has been imprisoned for debt Whoever he was I must heartily pity him but at the same time must put the Examiner in mind that notwithstanding he is a critic he still ought to remember he is a Christian Poverty was never thought a proper subject for ridicule and I do not remember that I ever met with a satire upon a beggar  As for those little retortings of my own expressions of  being dull by design witty in October shining excelling  and so forth they are the common cavils of every witlin who has no other method of shewing his parts but by little variations and repetitions of the man's words whom he attacks  But the truth of it is the paper before me not only in this particular but in its very essence is like Ovid's echo  Quae nec reticere loquenti  Nec prior ipsa loqui didicit  I should not have deserved the character of a Censor had I not animadverted upon the abovementioned author by a gentle chastisement But I know my reader will not pardon me unless I declare that nothing of this nature for the future unless it be written with some wit shall divert me from my care of the public  No Saturday October  Ad populum phaleras  Pers  From my own apartment  October  I DO not remember that in any of my lucubrations I have touched upon that useful science of physic notwithstanding I have declared myself more than once a professor of it I have indeed joined the study of astrology with it because I never knew a physician recommend himself to the public who had not a sister art to embellish his knowlege in medicine It has been commonly observed in compliment to the ingenious of our profession that Apollo was the god of verse as well as physic and in all ages the most celebrated practitioners of our country were the particular favourites of the muses Poetry to physic is indeed like the gilding to a pill it makes the art shine and covers the severity of the doctor with the agreeableness of the companion  The very foundation of poetry is good sense if we may allow Horace to be a judge of the art  Scribendi recte sapere est et principium et fons  And if so we have reason to believe that the same  man who writes well can prescribe well if he has applied himself to the study of both Besides when we see a man making profession of two different sciences it is natural for us to believe he is no pretender in that which we are not judges of when we find him skilful in that which we understand  Ordinary quacks and charlatans are throughly sensible how necessary it is to support themselves by these collateral assistances and therefore always lay their claim to some supernumerary accomplishments which are wholly foreign to their profession  About twenty years ago it was impossible to walk the streets without having an advertisement thrust into your hand of a doctor  who was arrived at the knowlege of the green and red dragon and had discovered the female fern seed  No body every knew what this meant but the green and red dragon so amused the people that the doctor lived very comfortably upon them About the same time there was pasted a very hard word upon every corner of the streets This to the best of my remembrance was  TETRACHYMAGOGON  which drew great shoals of spectators about it who read the bill that it introduced with unspeakable curiosity and when they were sick would have no body but this learned man for their physician  I once received an advertisement of one  who studied thirty years by candlelight for the good of his countrymen  He might have studied twice as long by daylight and never have been taken notice of but elucubrations cannot be overvalued There are some who have gained themselves great reputation sor physic by their birth as the  seventh son of a seventh son  and others by not being born at all as the Unborn Doctor who I hear is lately gone the way of his patients having died worth five hundred pounds per annum though he was not  born  to a halfpenny  My ingenious friend doctor Saffold succeeded my old  contemporary doctor Lilly in the studies both of physic and astrology to which he added that of poetry as was to be seen both upon the sign where he lived and in the bills which he distributed He was succeeded by doctor Case who erased the verses of his predecessor out of the signpost and substituted in their stead two of his own which were as follow  Within this place  Lives doctor Case  He is said to have got more by this distich than Mr Dryden did by all his works There would be no end of enumerating the several imaginary perfections and unaccountable artifices by which this tribe of men ensnare the minds of the vulgar and gain crouds of admirers I have seen the whole front of a mountebank's stage from one end to the other faced with patents certificates medals and great seals by which the several princes of Europe have testified their particular respect and esteem for the doctor Every great man with a sounding title has been his patient I believe I have seen twenty mountebanks that have given physic to the Czar of Muscovy The great duke of Tuscany escapes no better The elector of Brandenburg was likewise a very good patient  This great condescension of the doctor draws upon him much goodwill from his audience and it is ten to one but if any of them be troubled with an aching tooth his ambition will prompt him to get it drawn by a person who has had so many princes kings and emperors under his hands  I must not leave this subject without observing that as physicians are apt to deal in poetry apothecaries endeavour to recommend themselves by oratory and are therefore without controversy the most eloquent persons in the whole British nation I would not willingly discourage any of the arts especially that of which I am an humble professor but I must confess for the good of  my native country I could wish there might be a suspension of physic for some years that our kingdom which has been so much exhausted by the wars might have leave to recruit itself  As for myself the only physic which has brought me safe to almost the age of man and which I prescribe to all my friends is abstinence This is certainly the best physic for prevention and very often the most effectual against the present distemper In short my  recipe  is  Take nothing  Were the body politic to be physicked like particular persons I should venture to prescribe to it after the same manner I remember when our whole island was shaken with an earthquake some years ago there was an impudent mountebank who sold pills which as he told the country people were very good against an earthquake It may perhaps be thought as absurd to prescribe a diet for the allaying popular commotions and national ferments But I am verily persuaded that if in such a case a whole people were to enter into a course of abstinence and eat nothing but watergruel for a fortnight it would abate the rage and animosity of parties and not a little contribute to the cure of a distracted nation Such a fast would have a natural tendency to the procuring of those ends for which a fast is usually proclaimed If any man has a mind to enter on such a voluntary abstinence it might not be improper to give him the caution of Pythagoras in particular  Abstine a fabis  Abstain from beans  That is say the interpreters meddle not with elections beans having been made use of by the voters among the Athenians in the choice of magistrates  No Saturday October  Infert se septis nebula mirabile dictu  Per medios miscetque viris neque cernitur ulli  Virg  From my own apartment  October  I HAVE somewhere made mention of Gyges's ring and intimated to my reader that it was at present in my possession though I have not since made any use of it The tradition concerning this ring is very romantic and taken notice of both by Plato and Tully who each of them make an admirable use of it for the advancement of morality This Gyges was the master shepherd to king Candaules As he was wandering over the plains of Lydia he saw a great chasm in the earth and had the curiosity to enter it After having descended pretty far into it he found the statue of an horse in brass with doors in the sides of it Upon opening of them he found the body of a dead man bigger than ordinary with a ring upon his finger which he took off and put it upon his own The virtues of it were much greater than he at first imagined for upon his going into the assembly of shepherds he observed that he was invisible when he turned the stone of the ring within the palm of his hand and visible when he turned it towards his company Had Plato and Cicero been as well versed in the occult sciences as I am they would have found a great deal of mystic learning in this tradition but it is impossible for an adept to be understood by one who is not an adept  As for myself I have with much study and application arrived at this great secret of making myself invisible and by that means conveying myself where I please or to speak in Rosycrucian lore I have entered into the clefts of the earth discovered the brazen horse and robbed the dead giant of his ring The tradition says further of Gyges that by the means of this ring he gained admission  into the most retired parts of the court and made such use of those opportunities that he at length became king of Lydia For my own part I who have always rather endeavoured to improve my mind than my fortune have turned this ring to no other advantage than to get a thorough insight into the ways of men and to make such observations upon the errors of others as may be useful to the public whatever effect they may have upon myself  About a week ago not being able to sleep I got up and put on my magical ring and with a thought transported myself into a chamber where I saw a light I found it inhabited by a celebrated beauty though she is of that species of women which we call a slattern Her headdress and one of her shoes lay upon a chair her petticoat in one corner of the room and her girdle that had a copy of verses made upon it but the day before with her thread stockings in the middle of the floor I was so foolishly officious that I could not forbear gathering up her clothes together to lay them upon the chair that stood by her bedside when to my great surprize after a little muttering she cried out  What do you do Let my petticoat alone  I was startled at first but soon found that she was in a dream being one of those who to use Shakespear's expression are  so loose of thought  that they utter in their sleep every thing that passes in their imagination I left the apartment of this female rake and went into her neighbour's where there lay a malecoquet He had a bottle of salts hanging over his head and upon the table by his bedside  Suckling  's poems with a little heap of black patches on it His snuffbox was within reach on a chair but while I was admiring the disposition which he made of the several parts of his dress his slumber seemed interrupted by a pang that was accompanied by a sudden oath as he turned himself over hastily in his bed I did not care for seeing him in his nocturnal pains and left the room  I was no sooner got into another bedchamber but I  heard very harsh words uttered in a smooth uniform tone I was amazed to hear so great a volubility in reproach and thought it too coherent to be spoken by one asleep but upon looking nearer I saw the head dress of the person who spoke which shewed her to be a female with a man lying by her side broad awake and as quiet as a lamb I could not but admire his exemplary patience and discovered by his whole behaviour that he was then lying under the discipline of a curtainlecture  I was entertained in many other places with this kind of nocturnal eloquence but observed that most of those whom I found awake were kept so either by envy or by love Some of these were sighing and others cursing in soliloquy some hugged their pillows and others gnashed their teeth  The covetous I likewise found to be a very wakeful people I happened to come into a room where one of them lay sick His physician and his wife were in close whisper near his bedside I overheard the doctor say to the gentlewoman He cannot possibly live till five in the morning She received it like the mistress of a family prepared for all events At the same instant came in a servant maid who said  Madam The undertaker is below according to your order  The words were scarce out of her mouth when the sick man cried out with a feeble voice Pray doctor how went bank stock to day at  Change  This melancholy object made me too serious for diverting myself further this way but as I was going home I saw a light in a garret and entering into it heard a voice crying And Hand Stand Band Fann'd Tann'd I concluded him by this and the furniture of his room to be a lunatic but upon listening a little longer perceived it was a poet writing an heroic upon the ensuing peace  It was now towards morning an hour when spirits witches and conjurers are obliged to retire to their own apartments and feeling the influence of it I was hastening home when I saw a man had got half way into a neighbour's house I immediately called to him and turning  my ring appeared in my proper person There is something magisterial in the aspect of the Bickerstaffes which made him run away in confusion  As I took a turn or two in my own lodging I was thinking that old as I was I need not go to bed alone but that it was in my power to marry the finest lady in this kingdom if I would wed her with this ring For what a figure would she that should have it make at a visit with so perfect a knowlege as this would give her of all the scandal in the town But instead of endeavouring to dispose of myself and it in matrimony I resolved to lend it to my loving friend the author of the Atalantis to furnish a new Secret History of Secret Memoirs  No Saturday November  Per varios casus per tot discrimina rerum  Tendimus  From my own apartment  November  I WAS last night visited by a friend of mine who has an inexhaustible fund of discourse and never fails to entertain his company with a variety of thoughts and hints that are altogether new and uncommon Whether it were in complaisance to my way of living or his real opinion he advanced the following paradox That it required much greater talents to fill up and become a retired life than a life of business Upon this occasion he rallied very agreeably the busy men of the age who only valued themselves for being in motion and passing through a series of trifling and insignificant actions In the heat of his discourse seeing a piece of money lying on my table I defy says he any of these active persons to produce half the adventures that this twelvepenypiece has been engaged in were it possible for him to give us an account of his life  My friends's talk made so odd an impression upon my  mind that soon after I was abed I fell into a most unaccountable resverie that had neither moral nor design in it and cannot be so properly called a dream as a delirium  Methoughts the shilling that lay upon the table reared itself upon its edge and turning the face towards me opened its mouth and in a soft silver sound gave me the following account of his life and adventures  I was born says he on the fide of a mountain near a little village of Peru and made a voyage to England in an ingot under the convoy of Sir Francis Drake I was soon after my arrival taken out of my Indian habit resined naturalized and put into the British mode with the face of queen Elizabeth on one fide and the arms of the country on the other Being thus equipped I found in me a wonderful inclination to ramble and visit all the parts of the new world into which I was brought The people very much favoured my natural disposition and shifted me so fast from hand to hand that before I was five years old I had travelled into almost every corner of the nation But in the beginning of my sixth year to my unspeakable grief I fell into the hands of a miserable old fellow who clapped me into an iron chest where I found five hundred more of my own quality who lay under the same consinement The only relief we had was to be taken out and counted over in the fresh air every morning and evening After an imprisonment of several years we heard some body knocking at our chest and breaking it open with an hammer This we found was the old man's heir who as his father lay a dying was so good as to come to our release he separated us that very day What was the fate of my companions I know not as for myself I was sent to the apothecary's shop for a pint of sack The apothecary gave me to an herbwoman the herbwoman to a butcher the butcher to a brewer and the brewer to his wife who made a present of me to a nonconformist preacher After this manner I made my way merrily through the world for as  I told you before we shillings love nothing so much as travelling I sometimes fetched in a shoulder of mutton sometimes a playbook and often had the satisfaction to treat a Templer at the twelvepeny ordinary or carry him with three friends to WestminsterHall  In the midst of this pleasant progress which I made from place to place I was arrested by a superstitious old woman who shut me up in a greazy purse in pursuance of a foolish saying That while she kept a queen Elizabeth's shilling about her she should never be without money I continued here a close prisoner for many months till at last I was exchanged for eight and forty farthings  I thus rambled from pocket to pocket till the beginning of the civil wars when to my shame be it spoken I was employed in raising soldiers against the king for being of a very tempting breadth a sergeant made use of me to inveigle country fellows and list them in the service of the parliament  As soon as he had made one man sure his way was to oblige him to take a shilling of a more homely figure and then practise the same trick upon another Thus I continued doing great mischief to the crown till my officer chancing one morning to walk abroad earlier than ordinary sacrificed me to his pleasures and made use of me to seduce a milkmaid This wench bent me and gave me to her sweetheart applying more properly than she intended the usual form of  To my love and from my love  This ungenerous gallant marrying her within few days after pawned me for a dram of brandy and drinking me out next day I was beaten flat with an hammer and again set a running  After many adventures which it would be tedious to relate I was sent to a young spendthrift in company with the will of his deceased father The young fellow who I found was very extravagant gave great demonstrations of joy at the receiving of the will but opening it he found himself disinherited and cut off from the possession of a fair estate by virtue of my being made a present to  him This put him into such a passion that after having taken me in his hand and cursed me he squirred me away from him as far as he could fling me I chanced to light in an unfrequented place under a dead wall where I lay undiscovered and useless during the usurpation of Oliver Cromwell  About a year after the king's return a poor cavalier that was walking there about dinnertime fortunately cast his eye upon me and to the great joy of us both carried me to a cook's shop where he dined upon me and drank the king's health When I came again into the world I found that I had been happier in my retirement than I thought having probably by that means escaped wearing a monstrous pair of breeches  Being now of great credit and antiquity I was rather looked upon as a medal than an ordinary coin for which reason a gamester laid hold of me and converted me to a counter having got together some dozens of us for that use We led a melancholy life in his possession being busy at those hours wherein current coin is at rest and partaking the fate of our master being in a few moments valued at a crown a pound or a sixpence according to the situation in which the fortune of the cards placed us I had at length the good luck to see my master break by which means I was again sent abroad under my primitive denomination of a shilling  I shall pass over many other accidents of less moment and hasten to that fatal catastrophe when I fell into the hands of an artist who conveyed me under ground and with an unmerciful pair of sheers cut off my titles clipped my brims retrenched my shape rubbed me to my inmost ring and in short so spoiled and pillaged me that he did not leave me worth a groat You may think what a confusion I was in to see myself thus curtailed and disfigured I should have been ashamed to have shewn my head had not all my old acquaintance been reduced to the same shameful figure excepting some few that were punched through the belly In the midst of this general  calamity when every body thought our misfortune irretrievable and our case desperate we were thrown into the furnace together and as it often happens with cities rising out of a fire appeared with greater beauty and lustre than we could ever boast of before What has happened to me since this change of sex which you now see I shall take some other opportunity to relate In the mean time I shall only repeat two adventures as being very extraordinary and neither of them having ever happened to me above once in my life The first was my being in a poet's pocket who was so taken with the brightness and novelty of my appearance that it gave occasion to the finest burlesque poem in the British language entitled from me The splendid Shilling The second adventure which I must not omit happened to me in the year when I was given away in charity to a blind man but indeed this was by a mistake the person who gave me having heedlesly thrown me into the hat among a penyworth of farthings  No Tuesday November  Scis etenim justum gemina suspendere lance  Ancipitis librae  Pers  From my own apartment  November  I LAST winter erected a court of justice for the correcting of several enormities in dress and behaviour which are not cognizable in any other courts of this realm The vintner's case which I there tried is still fresh in every man's memory That of the petticoat gave also a general satisfaction not to mention the more important points of the cane and perspective in which if I did not give judgments and decrees according to the strictest rules of equity and justice I can safely say I acted according to the best of my understanding But as for the proceedings of that court I shall refer my reader to an account  of them written by my secretary which is now in the press and will shortly be published under the title of Lillie's Reports  As I last year presided over a court of justice it is my intention this year to set myself at the head of a court of honour There is no court of this nature any where at present except in France where according to the best of my intelligence it consists of such only as are marshals of that kingdom I am likewise informed that there is not one of that honourable board at present who has not been driven out of the field by the duke of Marlborough but whether this be only an accidental or a necessary qualification I must confess I am not able to determine  As for the court of honour of which I am here speaking I intend to sit myself in it as president with several men of honour on my right hand and women of virtue on my left as my assistants The first place of the bench I have given to an old Tangereen captain with a wooden leg The second is a gentleman of a long twisted periwig without a curl in it a muff with very little hair upon it and a threadbare coat with new buttons being a person of great worth and second brother to a man of quality The third is a gentleman usher extremely well read in romances and grandson to one of the greatest wits in Germany who was some time master of the ceremonies to the duke of Wolfembuttel  As for those who sit further on my right hand as it is usual in public courts they are such as will fill up the number of faces upon the bench and serve rather for ornament than use  The chief upon my left hand are an old maiden lady that preserves some of the best blood of England in her veins  A Welsh woman of a little stature but high spirit  An old prude that has censured every marriage for these thirty years and is lately wedded to a young rake  Having thus furnished my bench I shall establish correspondencies  with the horseguards and the veterans of ChelseaCollege the former to furnish me with twelve men of honour as often as I shall have occasion for a grand jury and the latter with as many good men and true for a petty jury  As for the women of virtue it will not be difficult for me to find them about midnight at crimp and basset  Having given this public notice of my court I must further add that I intend to open it on this day sevennight being Monday the twentieth instant and do hereby invite all such as have suffered injuries and affronts that are not to be redressed by the common laws of this land whether they be short bows cold salutations supercilious looks unreturned smiles distant behaviour or forced familiarity as also all such as have been aggrieved by any ambiguous expression accidental justle or unkind repartee likewise all such as have been defrauded of their right to the wall tricked out of the upper end of the table or have been suffered to place themselves in their own wrong on the backseat of the coach These and all of these I do as is abovesaid invite to bring in their several cases and complaints in which they shall be relieved with all imaginable expedition  I am very sensible that the office I have now taken upon me will engage me in the disquisition of many weighty points that daily perplex the youth of the British nation and therefore I have already discussed several of them for my future use as How far a man may brandish his cane in the telling a story without insulting his hearer What degree of contradiction amounts to the lie How a man should resent another's staring and cocking a hat in his face If asking pardon is an atonement for treading upon one's toes Whether a man may put up a box on the ear received from a stranger in the dark Or Whether a man of honour may take a blow of his wife with several other subtilties of the like nature  For my direction in the duties of my office I have furnished  myself with a certain astrological pair of scales which I have contrived for this purpose In one of them I lay the injuries in the other the reparations The first are represented by little weights made of a metal resembling iron and the other in gold These are not only lighter than the weights made use of in averdupois but also than such as are used in troyweight The heaviest of those that represent the injuries amount to but a scruple and decrease by so many subdivisions that there are several imperceptible weights which cannot be seen without the help of a very fine microscope I might acquaint my reader that these scales were made under the influence of the sun when he was in libra and describe many signatures on the weights both of injury and reparation but as this would look rather to proceed from an ostentation of my own art than any care for the public I shall pass it over in silence  No Tuesday November  Pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem  Conspexere silent arrectisque auribus astant  Virg  From my own apartment  November  Extract of the Journal of the Court of Honour  Die Lunae vicesimo Novembris hora nona Antemeridiana  THE court being sate an oath prepared by the censor was administered to the assistants on his right hand who were all sworn upon their honour The women on his left hand took the same oath upon their reputation Twelve gentlemen of the horseguards were impannelled having unanimously chosen Mr Alexander Truncheon who is their righthand man in the troop for their foreman in the jury Mr Truncheon immediately drew his sword and holding it with the point towards his own body presented it to the censor Mr Bickerstaffe received  it and after having surveyed the breadth of the blade and sharpness of the point with more than ordinary attention returned it to the foreman in a very graceful manner The rest of the jury upon the delivery of the sword to their foreman drew all of them together as one man and saluted the bench with such an air as signified the most resigned submission to those who commanded them and the greatest magnanimity to execute what they should command  Mr Bickerstaffe after having received the compliments on his righthand cast his eye upon the left where the whole female jury paid their respects by a low curtsie and by laying their hands upon their mouths Their forewoman was a professed Platonist that had spent much of her time in exhorting the sex to set a just value upon their persons and to make the men know themselves  There followed a profound silence when at length after some recollection the censor who continued hitherto uncovered put on his hat with great dignity and after having composed the brims of it in a manner suitable to the gravity of his character he gave the following charge which was received with silence and attention that being the only applause which he admits of or is ever given in his presence  The nature of my office and the solemnity of this occasion requiring that I should open my first session with a speech I shall cast what I have to say under two principal heads  Under the first I shall endeavour to show the necessity and usefulness of this new erected court and under the second I shall give a word of advice and instruction to every constituent part of it  As for the first it is well observed by Phaedrus an heathen poet  Nisi utile est quod facimus fruslra est gloria  Which is the same ladies as if I should say  It would be of no reputation for me to be president of a court which is  of no benefit to the public  Now the advantages that may arise to the weal public from this institution will more plainly appear if we consider what it suffers for the want of it Are not our streets daily filled with wild pieces of justice and random penalties Are not crimes undetermined and reparations disproportioned How often have we seen the lie punished by death and the liar himself deciding his own cause nay not only acting the judge but the executioner Have we not known a box on the ear more severely accounted for than manslaughter In these extrajudicial proceedings of mankind an unmannerly jest is frequently as capital as a premeditated murder  But the most pernicious circumstance in this case is that the man who suffers the injury must put himself upon the same foot of danger with him that gave it before he can have his just revenge so that the punishment is altogether accidental and may fall as well upon the innocent as the guilty I shall only mention a case which happens frequently among the more polite nations of the world and which I the rather mention because both sexes are concerned in it and which therefore you gentlemen and you ladies of the jury will the rather take notice of I mean that great and known case of cuckoldom Supposing the person who has suffered insults in his dearer and better half supposing I say this person should resent the injuries done to his tender wife What is the reparation he may expect Why to be used worse than his poor lady run through the body and left breathless upon the bed of honour What then will you on my right hand say must the man do that is affronted Must our sides be elbowed our shins broken Must the wall or perhaps our mistress be taken from us May a man knit his forehead into a frown toss up his arm or pish at what we say and must the villain live after it Is there no redress for injured honour Yes gentlemen that is the design of the judicature we have here established  A court of conscience we very well know was first instituted for the determining of several points of property that were too little and trivial for the cognizance of higher courts of justice In the same manner our court of honour is appointed for the examination of several niceties and punctilios that do not pass for wrongs in the eye of our common laws But notwithstanding no legislators of any nation have taken into consideration these little circumstances they are such as often lead to crimes big enough for their inspection though they come before them too late for their redress  Besides I appeal to you ladies  Here Mr Bickerstaffe turned to his left hand  if these are not the little slings and thorns in life that make it more uneasy than its most substantial evils Confess ingenuously did you never lose a morning's devotions because you could not offer them up from the highest place of the pew Have you not been in pain even at a ball because another has been taken out to dance before you Do you love any of your friends so much as those that are below you Or have you any favourites that walk on your right hand You have answered me in your looks I ask no more  I come now to the second part of my discourse which obliges me to address myself in particular to the respective members of the court in which I shall be very brief  As for you gentlemen and ladies my assistants and grand juries I have made choice of you on my right hand because I know you very jealous of your honour and you on my left because I know you very much concerned for the reputation of others for which reason I expect great exactness and impartiality in your verdicts and judgments  I must in the next place address myself to you gentlemen of the council You all know that I have not chosen you for your knowlege in the litigious parts of  the law but because you have all of you formerly fought duels of which I have reason to think you have repented as being now settled in the peaceable state of benchers My advice to you is only that in your pleadings you are short and expressive to which end you are to banish out of your discourses all synonymous terms and unnecessary multiplications of verbs and nouns I do moreover forbid you the use of the words  also  and  likewise  and must further declare that if I catch any one among you upon any pretence whatsoever using the particle  or  I shall incessantly order him to be stripped of his gown and thrown over the bar  This is a true copy  Charles Lillie  NB  The sequel of the proceedings of this day will be published on Tuesday next  Sir Richard Steele assisted in this paper  No Thursday November  Splendide mendax  Hor  From my own apartment  November  THERE are no books which I more delight in than in travels especially those that describe remote countries and give the writer an opportunity of shewing his parts without incurring any danger of being examined or contradicted Among all the authors of this kind our renowned countryman Sir John Mandeville has distinguished himself by the copiousness of his invention and greatness of his genius The second to Sir John I take to have been Ferdinand Mendez Pinto a person of infinite adventure and unbounded imagination One reads the voyages of these two great wits with as much astonishment  as the travels of Ulysses in Homer or of the RedCross knight in Spenser All is enchanted ground and fairy land  I have got into my hands by great chance several manuscripts of these two eminent authors which are filled with greater wonders than any of those they have communicated to the public and indeed were they not so well attested would appear altogether improbable I am apt to think the ingenious authors did not publish them with the rest of their works lest they should pass for fictions and fables a caution not unnecessary when the reputation of their veracity was not yet established in the world But as this reason has now no further weight I shall make the public a present of these curious pieces at such times as I shall find myself unprovided with other subjects  The present paper I intend to fill with an extract of Sir John's journal in which that learned and worthy knight gives an account of the freezing and thawing of several short speeches which he made in the territories of Nova Zembla I need not inform my reader that the author of Hudibras alludes to this strange quality in that cold climate when speaking of abstracted notions clothed in a visible shape he adds that apt simile  Like words congeal'd in northern air  Not to keep my reader any longer in suspence the relation put into modern language is as follows  We were separated by a storm in the latitude of insomuch that only the ship which I was in with a Dutch and a French vessel got safe into a creek of Nova Zembla We landed in order to resit our vessels and store ourselves with provisions The crew of each vessel made themselves a cabin of turf and wood at some distance from each other to fence themselves against the inclemencies of the weather which was severe beyond imagination We soon observed that in talking to one another we lost several of our words and could not hear one another at above  two yards distance and that too when we sate very near the fire After much perplexity I found that our words froze in the air before they could reach the ears of the person to whom they were spoken I was soon confirmed in this conjecture when upon the encrease of the cold the whole company grew dumb or rather deaf for every man was sensible as we afterwards found that he spoke as well as ever but the sounds no sooner took air than they were condensed and lost It was now a miserable spectacle to see us nodding and gaping at one another every man talking and no man heard One might observe a seaman that could hail a ship at a league distance beckoning with his hands straining his lungs and tearing his throat but all in vain  Nee vox nec verba sequuntur  We continued here three weeks in this dismal plight At length upon a turn of wind the air about us began to thaw Our cabin was immediately filled with a dry clattering sound which I afterwards found to be the crackling of consonants that broke above our heads and were often mixed with a gentle hissing which I imputed to the letter S that occurs so frequently in the English tongue I soon after felt a breeze of whispers rushing by my ear for those being of a soft and gentle substance immediately liquefied in the warm wind that blew across our cabin These were soon followed by syllables and short words and at length by entire sentences that melted sooner or latter as they were more or less congealed so that we now heard every thing that had been  spoken  during the whole three weeks that we had been  silent  if I may use that expression It was now very early in the morning and yet to my surprize I heard some body say  Sir John it is midnight and time for the ship's crew to go to bed  This I knew to be the pilot's voice and upon recollecting myself I concluded that he had spoken these words to me some days before though I could not hear them before the present thaw My reader will easily imagine how  the whole crew was amazed to hear every man talking and see no man opening his mouth In the midst of this great surprize we were all in we heard a volley of oaths and curses lasting for a long while and uttered in a very hoarse voice which I knew belonged to the boatswain who was a very choleric fellow and had taken his opportunity of cursing and swearing at me when he thought I could not hear him for I had several times given him the strapado on that account as I did not fail to repeat it for these his pious soliloquies when I got him on shipboard  I must not omit the names of several beauties in Wapping which were heard every now and then in the midst of a long sigh that accompanied them as Dear Kate Pretty Mrs Peggy When shall I see my Sue again this betrayed several amours which had been concealed till that time and furnished us with a great deal of mirth in our return to England  When this confusion of voices was pretty well over though I was afraid to offer at speaking as fearing I should not be heard I proposed a visit to the Dutch cabin which lay about a mile further up into the country My crew were extremely rejoiced to find they had again recovered their hearing though every man uttered his voice with the same apprehensions that I had done  Et timide verba intermissa retentat  At about half a mile's distance from our cabin we heard the groanings of a bear which at first startled us but upon enquiry we were informed by some of our company that he was dead and now lay in salt having been killed upon that very spot about a fortnight before in the time of the frost Not far from the same place we were likewise entertained with some posthumous snarls and barkings of a fox  We at length arrived at the little Dutch settlement and upon entering the room found it filled with sighs that smelt of brandy and several other unfavoury sounds  that were altogether inarticulate My valet who was an Irishman fell into so great a rage at what he heard that he drew his sword but not knowing where to lay the blame he put it up again We were stunned with these confused noises but did not hear a single word till about half an hour after which I ascribed to the harsh and obdurate sounds of that language which wanted more time than ours to melt and become audible  After having here met with a very hearty welcome we went to the French cabin who to make amends for their three weeks silence were talking and disputing with greater rapidity and confusion than ever I heard in an assembly even of that nation Their language as I found upon the first giving of the weather fell asunder and dissolved I was here convinced of an error into which I had before fallen for I fancied that for the freezing of the sound it was necessary for it to be wrapped up and as it were preserved in breath but I found my mistake when I heard the sound of a kit playing a minuit over our heads I asked the occasion of it upon which one of the company told me that it would play there above a week longer if the thaw continued for says he finding ourselves bereft of speech we prevailed upon one of the company who had this musical instrument about him to play to us from morning to night all which time we employed in dancing in order to dissipate our chagrin  et tuer le temps  Here Sir John gives very good philosophical reasons why the kit could be heard during the frost but as they are something prolix I pass over them in silence and shall only observe that the honourable author seems by his quotations to have been well versed in the ancient poets which perhaps raised his fancy above the ordinary pitch of historians and very much contributed to the embellishment of his writings  No Saturday November  Nec te tua plurima Pantheu  Labentem pietas nec Apollinis infula texit  Virg  From my own apartment  November  To the censor of Great Britain  SIR  I AM at present under very great difficulties which it is not in the power of any one besides yourself to redress Whether or no you shall think it a proper case to come before your Court of Honour I cannot tell but thus it is I am chaplain to an honourable family very regular at the hours of devotion and I hope of an unblameable life but for not offering to rise at second course I found my patron and his lady very sullen and out of humour though at first I did not know the reason of it At length when I happened to help myself to a jelly the lady of the house otherwise a devout woman told me That it did not become a man of my cloth to delight in such frivolous food but as I still continued to sit out the last course I was yesterday informed by the butler that his lordship had no further occasion for my service All which is humbly submitted to your consideration by  SIR  Your most humble servant etc  The case of this gentleman deserves pity especially if he loves sweetmeats to which if I may guess by his letter he is no enemy In the mean time I have often wondered at the indecency of discarding the holiest man from the table as soon as the most delicious parts of the entertainment are served up and could never conceive a reason for so absurd a custom Is it because a liquorish palate or a sweet tooth as they call it is not consistent with the sanctity of his character This is but a trifling pretence No man of the most rigid virtue gives offence  by any excesses in plumbpudding or plumbporridge and that because they are the first parts of the dinner Is there any thing that tends to incitation in sweetmeats more than in ordinary dishes Certainly not Sugarplumbs are a very innocent diet and conserves of a much colder nature than our common pickles I have sometimes thought that the ceremony of the chaplain's flying away from the dessert was typical and figurative to mark out to the company how they ought to retire from all the luscious baits of temptation and deny their appetites the gratifications that are most pleasing to them or at least to signify that we ought to stint ourselves in our most lawful satisfactions and not make our pleasure but our support the end of eating but most certainly if such a lesson of temperance had been necessary at a table our clergy would have recommended it to all the laymasters of families and not have disturbed other mens tables with such unseasonable examples of abstinence The original therefore of this barbarous custom I take to have been meerly accidental The chaplain retired out of pure complaisance to make room for the removal of the dishes or possibly for the ranging of the dessert This by degrees grew into a duty till at length as the fashion improved the good man found himself cut off from the third part of the entertainment and if the arrogance of the patron goes on it is not impossible but in the next generation he may see himself reduced to the tythe or tenth dish of the table a sufficient caution not to part with any privilege we are once possessed of It was usual for the priest in old times to feast upon the sacrifice nay the honeycake while the hungry laity looked upon him with great devotion or as the late lord Rochester describes it in a lively manner  And while the priest did eat the people stared  At present the custom is inverted the laity feast while the priest stands by as an humble spectator This necessarily puts the good man upon making great ravages upon  all the dishes that stand near him and distinguishing himself by voraciousness of appetite as knowing that his time is short I would fain ask these stiffnecked patrons whether they would not take it ill of a chaplain that in his grace after meat should return thanks for the whole entertainment with an exception to the dessert And yet I cannot but think that in such a proceeding he would but deal with them as they deserved What would a Roman catholic priest think who is always helped first and placed next the ladies should he see a clergyman giving his company the slip at the first appearance of the tarts or sweetmeats Would not he believe that he had the same antipathy to a candied orange or a piece of puffpaste as some have to a Cheshire cheese or a breast of mutton Yet to so ridiculous a height is this foolish custom grown that even the Christmas pye which in its very nature is a kind of consecrated cate and a badge of distinction is often forbidden to the druid of the family Strange that a sirloin of beef whether boiled or roasted when entire is exposed to his utmost depredations and incisions but if minced into small pieces and tossed up with plumbs and sugar changes its property and sorsooth is meat for his master  In this case I know not which to censure the patron or the chaplain the insolence of power or the abjectness of dependence For my own part I have often blushed to see a gentleman whom I knew to have much more wit and learning than myself and who was bred up with me at the university upon the same foot of a liberal education treated in such an ignominious manner and sunk beneath those of his own rank by reason of that character which ought to bring him honour This deters men of generous minds from placing themselves in such a station of life and by that means frequently excludes persons of quality from the improving and agreeable conversation of a learned and obsequious friend  Mr Oldham lets us know that he was affrighted from  the thought of such an employment by the scandalous sort of treatment which often accompanies it  Some think themselves exalted to the sky  If they light in some noble family  Diet a horse and thirty pounds a year  Besides th' advantage of his lordship's ear  The credit of the business and the state  Are things that in a youngster's sense sound great  Little the unexperienc'd wretch does know  What slavery he oft must undergo  Who tho' in silken scarf and cassoc drest  Wears but a gayer livery at best  When dinner calls the implement must wait  With holy words to consecrate the meat  But hold it for a favour seldom known  If he be deign'd the honour to sit down  Soon as the tarts appear Sir Crape withdraw  Those danties are not for a spiritual maw  Observe your distance and be sure to stand  Hard by the cistern with your cap in hand  There for diversion you may pick your teeth  Till the kind voider comes for your relief  Let others who such meannesses can brook  Strike countenance to ev'ry great man's look  I rate my freedom higher  This author's raillery is the raillery of a friend and does not turn the sacred order into ridicule but is a just censure on such persons as take advantage from the necessities of a man of merit to impose on him hardships that are by no means suitable to the dignity of his profession  No Tuesday November  Nostrum est tantas componere lites  Virg  The proceedings of the Court of Honour held in Sheerlane on Monday the th of November before Isaac Bickerstaffe  Esq  censor of Great Britain  PETER PLUMB of London merchant was indicted by the honourable Mr Thomas Gules of Gulehall in the county of Salop for that the said Peter Plumb did in Lombardstreet London between the hours of two and three in the afternoon meet the said Mr Thomas Gules and after a short salutation put on his hat value fivepence while the honourable Mr Gules stood bareheaded for the space of two seconds It was further urged against the criminal that during his discourse with the prosecutor he feloniously stole the wall of him having clapped his back against it in such a manner that it was impossible for Mr Gules to recover it again at his taking leave of him The prosecutor alleged that he was the cadet of a very ancient family and that according to the principles of all the younger brothers of the said family he had never sullied himself with business but had chosen rather to starve like a man of honour than do any thing beneath his quality He produced several witnesses that he had never employed himself beyond the twisting of a whip or the making of a pair of nutcrackers in which he only worked for his diversion in order to make a present now and then to his friends The prisoner being asked what he could say for himself cast several reflections upon the honourable Mr Gules as that he was not worth a groat that no body in the city would trust him for a halfpenny that he owed him money which he had promised to pay him several times but never kept his word and in short that he was an idle beggarly fellow and of no use to the  public This sort of language was very severely reprimanded by the censor who told the criminal that he spoke in contempt of the court and that he should be proceeded against for contumacy if he did not change his style The prisoner therefore desired to be heard by his council who urged in his defence that he put on his hat through ignorance and took the wall by accident They likewise produced several witnesses that he made several motions with his hat in his hand which are generally understood as an invitation to the person we talk with to be covered and that the gentleman not taking the hint he was forced to put on his hat as being troubled with a cold There was likewise an Irishman who deposed that he had heard him cough three and twenty times that morning And as for the wall it was alleged that he had taken it inadvertently to save himself from a shower of rain which was then falling The censor having consulted the men of honour who sate at his right hand on the bench found they were of opinion that the defence made by the prisoner's council did rather aggravate than extenuate his crime that the motions and intimations of the hat were a token of superiority in conversation and therefore not to be used by the criminal to a man of the prosecutor's quality who was likewise vested with a double title to the wall at the time of their conversation both as it was the upper hand and as it was a shelter from the weather The evidence being very full and clear the jury without going out of the court declared their opinion unanimously by the mouth of their foreman that the prosecutor was bound in honour to make the sun shine through the criminal or as they afterwards explained themselves to whip him through the lungs  The censor knitting his brows into a frown and looking very sternly upon the jury after a little pause gave them to know that this court was erected for the finding out of penalties suitable to offences and to restrain the outrages of private justice and that he expected they  should moderate their verdict The jury therefore retired and being willing to comply with the advices of the censor after an hour's consultation declared their opinion as follows  That in consideration this was Peter Plumb's first offence and that there did not appear any  malice propense  in it as also that he lived in good reputation among his neighbours and that his taking the wall was only  se defendendo  the prosecutor should let him escape with life and content himself with the slitting of his nose and the cutting off both his ears Mr Bickerstaffe smiling upon the court told them that he thought the punishment even under its present mitigation too severe and that such penalties might be of ill consequence in a trading nation He therefore pronounced sentence against the criminal in the following manner That his hat which was the instrument of offence should be forfeited to the court that the criminal should go to the warehouse from whence he came and thence as occasion should require proceed to the Exchange or Garraway's coffeehouse in what manner he pleased but that neither he nor any of the family of the Plumbs should hereafter appear in the streets of London out of their coaches that so the footway might be left open and undisturbed for their betters  Dathan a peddling Jew and T R a Welshman were indicted by the keeper of an alehouse in Westminster for breaking the peace and two earthen mugs in a dispute about the antiquity of their families to the great detriment of the house and disturbance of the whole neighbourhood Dathan said for himself that he was provoked to it by the Welshman who pretended that the Welsh were an ancienter people than the Jews whereas says he I can shew by this genealogy in my hand that I am the son of Mesheck that was the son of Naboth that was the son of Shalem that was the son ofThe Welshman here interrupted him and told him that he could produce shennalogy as well as himself for that he was John ap Rice ap Shenkin ap Shones He then  turned himself to the censor and told him in the same broken accent and with much warmth that the Jew would needs uphold that king Cadwallader was younger than Issachar Mr Bickerstaffe seemed very much inclined to give sentence against Dathan as being a Jew but finding reasons by some expressions which the Welshman let fall in asserting the antiquity of his family to suspect that the said Welshman was a PraeAdamite he suffered the jury to go out without any previous admonition After some time they returned and gave their verdict that it appearing the persons at the bar did neither of them wear a sword and that consequently they had no right to quarrel upon a point of honour to prevent such frivolous appeals for the future they should both of them be tossed in the same blanket and there adjust the superiority as they could agree it between themselves The censor confirmed the verdict  Richard Newman was indicted by major Punto for having used the words  Perhaps it may be so  in a dispute with the said major The major urged that the word  perhaps  was questioning his veracity and that it was an indirect manner of giving him the lie Richard Newman had nothing more to say for himself than that he intended no such thing and threw himself upon the mercy of the court The jury brought in their verdict special  Mr Bickerstaffe stood up and after having cast his eyes over the whole assembly hemmed thrice He then acquainted them that he had laid down a rule to himself which he was resolved never to depart from and which as he conceived would very much conduce to the shortening the business of the court I mean says he never to allow of the lie being given by construction implication or induction but by the sole use of the word itself He then proceeded to shew the great mischiefs that had arisen to the English nation from that pernicious monosyllable that it had bred the most fatal quarrels between the dearest friends that it had frequently thinned the guards and made great havoc in the army that it had  sometimes weakened the city trainedbands and in a word had destroyed many of the bravest men in the isle of Great Britain For the prevention of which evils for the future he instructed the jury to  present  the word itself as a nuisance in the English tongue and further promised them that he would upon such their presentment publish an edict of the court for the entire banishment and exclusion of it out of the discourses and conversation of all civil societies  This is a true copy

No Thursday November  In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas  Corpora Dii coeptis nam vos mutastis et illas  Aspirate meis  Ovid Mer  From my own apartment  November  EVERY nation is distinguished by productions that are peculiar to it Great Britain is particularly fruitful in religions that shoot up and flourish in this climate more than in any other We are so famous abroad for our great variety of sects and opinions that an ingenious friend of mine who is lately returned from his travels assures me there is a show at this time  carried  up and down in Germany which represents all the religions in Great Britain in waxwork Notwithstanding that the pliancy of the matter in which the images are wrought  makes it capable of being moulded into all shapes and figures my friend tells me that he did not think it possible for it to be twisted and tortured into so many skrewed faces and wry features as appeared in several of the figures that composed the show I was indeed so pleased with the design of the German artist that I begged my friend to give me an account of it in all its particulars which he did after the following manner  I have often says he been present at a show of elephants camels dromedaries and other strange creatures but I never saw so great an assembly of spectators as were met together at the opening of this great piece of waxwork We were all placed in a large hall according to the price that we had paid for our seats the curtain that hung before the show was made by a master of tapestry who had woven it in the figure of a monstrous Hydra that had several heads which brandished out their tongues and seemed to hiss at each other Some of these heads were large and entire and where any of them had been lopped away there sprouted up several in the room of them insomuch that for one head cut off a man might see ten twenty or an hundred of a smaller size creeping through the wound In short the whole picture was nothing but confusion and bloodshed On a sudden says my friend I was startled with a flourish of many musical instruments that I had never heard before which was followed by a short tune if it might be so called wholly made up of jars and discords Among the rest there was an organ a bagpipe a groaningboard a Stentorophonic trumpet with several windinstruments of a most disagreeable sound which I do not so much as know the names of After a short flourish the curtain was drawn up and we were presented with the most extraordinary assembly of figures that ever entered into a man's imagination The design of the workman was so well expressed in the dumb thow before us that it was not hard for an Englishman to comprehend the meaning of it  The principal figures were placed in a row consisting  of seven persons The middle figure which immediately attracted the eyes of the whole company and was much bigger than the rest was formed like a matron dressed in the habit of an elderly woman of quality in queen Elisabeth's days The most remarkable parts of her dress was the beaver with the steeple crown the scarf that was darker than sable and the lawn apron that was whiter than ermin Her gown was of the richest black velvet and just upon her heart studded with large diamonds of an inestimable value disposed in the form of a cross She bore an inexpressible chearfulness and dignity in her aspect and though she seemed in years appeared with so much spirit and vivacity as gave her at the same time an air of old age and immortality I found my heart touched with so much love and reverence at the sight of her that the tears ran down my face as I looked upon her and still the more I looked upon her the more my heart was melted with the sentiments of filial tenderness and duty I discovered every moment something so charming in this figure that I could scarce take my eyes off it On its right hand there sate the figure of a woman so covered with ornaments that her face her body and her hands were almost entirely hid under them The little you could see of her face was painted and what I thought very odd had something in it like artificial wrinkles but I was the less surprised at it when I saw upon her forehead an old fashioned tower of grey hairs Her headdress rose very high by three several stories or degrees her garments had a thousand colours in them and were embroidered with crosses in gold silver and silk she had nothing on so much as a glove or a slipper which was not marked with this figure nay so superstitiously fond did she appear of it that she sate crosslegged I was quickly sick of this tawdry composition of ribands silks and jewels and therefore cast my eye on a dame which was just the reverse of it I need not tell my reader that the lady before described was Popery or that she I am going to describe is Presbytery She sate on the left  hand of the venerable matron and so much resembled her in the features of her countenance that she seemed her sister but at the same time that one observed a likeness in her beauty one could not but take notice that there was something in it sickly and splenetic Her face had enough to discover the relation but it was drawn up into a peevish figure soured with discontent and overcast with melancholy She seemed offended at the matron for the shape of her hat as too much resembling the triple coronet of the person who sate by her One might see likewise that she dissented from the white apron and the cross for which reason she had made herself a plain homely dowdy and turned her face towards the sectaries that sate on the left hand as being afraid of looking upon the matron left she should see the harlot by her  On the right hand of Popery sate Judaism represented by an old man embroidered with phylacteries and distinguished by many typical figures which I had not skill enough to unriddle He was placed among the rubbish of a temple but instead of weeping over it which I should have expected from him he was counting out a bag of money upon the ruins of it  On his right hand was Deism or Natural Religion This was a figure of an halfnaked aukward country wench who with proper ornaments and education would have made an agreeable and beautiful appearance but for want of those advantages was such a spectacle as a man would blush to look upon  I have now continued my friend given you an account of those who were placed on the right hand of the matron and who according to the order in which they sate were Deism Judaism and Popery On the left hand as I told you appeared Presbytery The next to her was a figure which somewhat puzzled me It was that of a man looking with horror in his eyes upon a silver bason filled with water Observing something in his countenance that looked like lunacy I fancied at first that he was to express that kind of distraction which the physicians  call the hydrophobia but considering what the intention of the show was I immediately recollected myself and concluded it to be Anabaptism  The next figure was a man that sate under a most profound composure of mind he wore an hat whose brims were exactly parallel with the horizon his garment had neither sleeve nor skirt nor so much as a superfluous button What he called his cravat was a little piece of white linnen quilled with great exactness and hanging below his chin about two inches Seeing a book in his hand I asked our artist what it was who told me it was the Quakers religion upon which I desired a sight of it Upon perusal I found it to be nothing but a newfashioned grammar or an art of abridging ordinary discourse The nouns were reduced to a very small number as the  light friend Babylon  The principal of his pronouns was  thou  and as for  you ye  and  yours  I found they were not looked upon as parts of speech in this grammar All the verbs wanted the second person plural the participles ending all in  ing  or  ed  which were marked with a particular accent There were no adverbs besides  yea  and  nay  The same thrift was observed in the prepositions The conjunctions were only  hem  and  ha  and the interjections brought under the three heads of sighing sobbing and groaning There was at the end of the grammar a little nomenclature called  the Christian man's vocabulary  which gave new appellations or if you will Christian names to almost every thing in life I replaced the book in the hand of the figure not without admiring the simplicity of its garb speech and behaviour  Just opposite to this row of religions there was a statue dressed in a fool's coat with a cap of bells upon his head laughing and pointing at the figures that stood before him This ideot is supposed to say in his heart what David's fool did some thousands of years ago and was therefore designed as a proper representative of those  among us who are called Atheists and Infidels by others and Freethinkers by themselves  There were many other groupes of figures which I did not know the meaning of but seeing a collection of both sexes turning their backs upon the company and laying their heads very close together I enquired after their religion and found that they called themselves the Philadelphians or the family of love  In the opposite corner there sate another little congregation of strange figures opening their mouths as wide as they could gape and distinguished by the title of the  sweet singers of Israel  I must not omit that in this assembly of wax there were several pieces that moved by clockwork and gave great satisfaction to the spectators Behind the matron there stood one of these figures and behind Popery another which as the artist told us were each of them the genius of the person they attended That behind Popery represented Persecution and the other Moderation The first of these moved by secret springs towards a great heap of dead bodies that lay piled upon one another at a considerable distance behind the principal figures There were written on the foreheads of these dead men several hard words as PraeAdamites Sabbatarians Cameronians Muggletonians Brownists Independents Masonites Camisars and the like At the approach of Persecution it was so contrived that as she held up her bloody flag the whole assembly of dead men like those in the Rehearsal started up and drew their swords This was followed by great clashings and noise when in the midst of the tumult the figure of Moderation moved gently towards this new army which upon her holding up a paper in her hand inscribed Liberty of Conscience immediately fell into a heap of carcasses remaining in the same quiet posture that they lay at first  No Tuesday December  Vexat censura columbas  Juv  A continuation of the journal of the Court of Honour held in SheerLane on Monday the th of November before Isaac Bickerstaffe  Esq  censor of Great Britain  ELIZABETH MAKEBATE of the parish of St Catherine's spinster was indicted for surreptitiously taking away the hassoc from under the lady GraveAirs between the hours of four and five on Sunday the th of November The prosecutor deposed that as she stood up to make a curtsy to a person of quality in a neighbouring pew the criminal conveyed away the hassoc by stealth insomuch that the prosecutor was obliged to sit all the while she was at church or to say her prayers in a posture that did not become a woman of her quality The prisoner pleaded inadvertency and the jury were going to bring it in chancemedly had not several witnesses been produced against the said Elizabeth Makebate that she was an old offender and a woman of a bad reputation It appeared in particular that on the Sunday before she had detracted from a new petticoat of Mrs Mary Doelittle having said in the hearing of several credible witnesses that the said petticoat was scowred to the great grief and detriment of the said Mary Doelittle There were likewise many evidences produced against the criminal that though she never failed to come to church on Sunday she was a most notorious Sabbathbreaker and that she spent her whole time during divine service in disparaging other people's clothes and whispering to those who sate next her Upon the whole she was found guilty of the indictment and received sentence to ask pardon of the prosecutor upon her bare knees without either cushion or hassoc under her in the face of the court  NB  As soon as the sentence was executed on the criminal which was done in open court with the utmost severity the first lady of the bench on Mr Bickerstaffe's right hand stood up and made a motion to the court that whereas it was impossible for women of fashion to dress themselves before the church was half done and whereas many confusions and inconveniencies did arise thereupon it might be lawful for them to send a footman in order to keep their places as was usual in other polite and wellregulated assemblies The motion was ordered to be entered in the books and considered at a more convenient time  Charles Cambric linendraper in the city of Westminster was indicted for speaking obscenely to the lady Penelope Touchwood It appeared that the prosecutor and her woman going in a stagecoach from London to Brentford where they were to be met by the lady's own chariot the criminal and another of his acquaintance travelled with them in the same coach at which time the prisoner talked bawdy for the space of three miles and a half The prosecutor alleged that overagainst  the old fox  at Knightsbridge he mentioned the word  linen  that at the further end of Kensington he made use of the term  smock  and that before he came to Hammersmith he talked almost a quarter of an hour upon weddingshifts The prosecutor's woman confirmed what her lady had said and added further that she had never seen her lady in so great a confusion and in such a taking as she was during the whole discourse of the criminal The prisoner had little to say for himself but that he talked only in his own trade and meant no hurt by what he said The jury however found him guilty and represented by their forewoman that such discourses were apt to sully the imagination and that by a concatenation of ideas the word  linen  implied many things that were not proper to be stirred up in the mind of a woman who was of the prosecutor's quality and therefore gave it as their verdict that the linendraper  should lose his tongue Mr Bickerstaffe said he thought the prosecutor's ears were as much to blame as the prisoner's tongue and therefore gave sentence as follows that they should both be placed overagainst one another in the midst of the court there to remain for the space of one quarter of an hour during which time the linendraper was to be gagged and the lady to hold her hands close upon both her ears which was executed accordingly  Edward Callicoat was indicted as an accomplice to Charles Cambric for that he the said Edward Callicoat did by his silence and his smiles seem to approve and abet the said Charles Cambric in every thing he said It appeared that the prisoner was foreman of the shop to the aforesaid Charles Cambric and by his post obliged to smile at every thing that the other should be pleased to say upon which he was acquitted  Josias Shallow was indicted in the name of dame Winifred sole relict of Richard Dainty  Esq  for having said several times in company and in the hearing of several persons there present that he was extremely obliged to the widow Dainty and that he should never be able sufficiently to express his gratitude The prosecutor urged that this might blast her reputation and that it was in effect a boasting of favours which he had never received The prisoner seemed to be much astonished at the construction which was put upon his words and said that he meant nothing by them but that the widow had befriended him in a lease and was very kind to his younger sister The jury finding him a little weak in his understanding without going out of the court brought in their verdict Ignoramus  Ursula Goodenough was accused by the the lady Betty Wou'dbe for having said that she the lady Betty Wou'dbe was painted The prisoner brought several persons of good credit to witness to her reputation and proved by undeniable evidences that she was never at the place where the words were said to have been uttered The  censor observing the behaviour of the prosecutor found reason to believe that she had indicted the prisoner for no other reason but to make her complexion be taken notice of which indeed was very fresh and beautiful he therefore asked the offender with a very stern voice how she could presume to spread so groundless a report and whether she saw any colours in the lady Wou'dbe's face that could procure credit to such a falshood do you see says he any lilies or roses in her cheeks any bloom any probabilityThe prosecutor not able to bear such language any longer told him that he talked like a blind old fool and that she was ashamed to have entertained any opinion of his wisdom but she was put to silence and sentenced to wear her mask for five months and not to presume to shew her face till the town should be empty  Benjamin Buzzard  Esq  was indicted for having told the lady Everbloom at a public ball that she looked very well for a woman of her years The prisoner not denying the fact and presisting before the court that he looked upon it as a compliment the jury brought him in  non compos mentis  The court then adjourned to Monday the th instant  Copia vera  Charles Lillie  Sir Richard Steele assisted in this paper  No Thursday December  Non cuicunque datum est habere nasum  Mart  From my own apartment  December  WE have a very learned and elaborate dissertation upon thumbs in Montaigne's Essays and another upon ears in the  Tale of a Tub  I am here going to write one upon noses having choson for my text the following verses out of Hudibras  So learned Talicotius from  The brawny part of Porter's bum  Cut supplemental noses which  Lasted as long as parent breech  But when the date of nock was out  Off drop'd the sympathetic snout  Notwithstanding that there is nothing obscene in natural knowlege and that I intend to give as little offence as may be to readers of a wellbred imagination I must for my own quiet desire the critics who in all times have been famous for good noses to refrain from the lecture of this curious tract These gentlemen were formerly marked out and distinguished by the little rhinocerical nose which was always looked upon as an instrument of derision and which they were used to cock toss or draw up in a contemptuous manner upon reading the works of their ingenious contemporaries It is not therefore for this generation of men that I write the present transaction  Minus aptus acutis  Naribus horum hominum  But for the sake of some of my philosophical friends in the royal society who peruse discourses of this nature with a becoming gravity and a desire of improving by them  Many are the opinions of learned men concerning the rise of that fatal distemper which has always taken a particular pleasure in venting its spight upon the nose I have seen a little burlesque poem in Italian that gives a very pleasant account of this matter The fable of it runs thus Mars the God of war having served during the siege of Naples in the shape of a French colonel received a visit one night from Venus the goddess of love who had been always his professed mistress and admirer The poem says she came to him in the disguise of a suttling  wench with a bottle of brandy under her arm Let that be as it will he managed matters so well that she went away bigbellied and was at length brought to bed of a little Cupid This boy whether it were by reason of any bad food that his father had eaten during the siege or of any particular malignity in the stars that reigned at his nativity came into the world with a very sickly look and crazy constitution As soon as he was able to handle his bow he made discoveries of a most perverse disposition He dipped all his arrows in poison that rotted every thing they touched and what was more particular aimed all his shafts at the nose quite contrary to the practice of his elder brothers who had made a human heart their butt in all countries and ages To break him of this roguish trick his parents put him to school to Mercury who did all he could to hinder him from demolishing the noses of mankind but in spight of education the boy continued very unlucky and though his malice was a little softened by good instructions he would very frequently let fly an invenomed arrow and wound his votaries oftner in the nose than in the heart Thus far the fable  I need not tell my learned reader that Correggio has drawn a Cupid taking his lesson from Mercury conformable to this poem nor that the poem itself was designed as a burlesque upon Fracastorius  It was a little after this fatal siege of Naples that Talicotius begun to practise in a town of Germany He was the first clapdoctor that I meet with in history and a greater man in his age than our celebrated Dr Wall He saw his species extremely mutilated and disfigured by this new distemper that was crept into it and therefore in pursuance of a very seasonable invention set up a manufacture of noses having first got a patent that none should presume to make noses besides himself His first patient was a great man of Portugal who had done good services to his country but in the midst of them unfortunately lost his nose Talicotius grafted a new one  on the remaining part of the gristle or cartilaginous substance which would sneeze smell take snuff pronounce the letters  M  or  N  and in short do all the functions of a genuine and natural nose There was however one misfortune in this experiment The Portuguese's complexion was a little upon the subfusc with very black eyes and dark eyebrows and the nose being taken from a porter that had a white German skin and cut out of those parts that are not exposed to the sun it was very visible that the features of his face were not fellows In a word the Conde resembled one of those maimed antique statues that has often a modern nose of fresh marble glewed to a face of such a yellow ivory complexion as nothing can give but age To remedy this particular for the future the doctor got together a great collection of porters men of all complexions black brown fair dark sallow pale and ruddy so that it was impossible for a patient of the most outoftheway colour not to find a nose to match it  The doctor's house was now very much enlarged and become a kind of college or rather hospital for the fashionable cripples of both sexes that resorted to him from all parts of Europe Over his door was fastened a large golden snout not unlike that which is placed over the great gates at BrazenNose college in Oxford and as it is usual for the learned in foreign universities to distinguish their houses by a Latin sentence the doctor writ underneath this great golden proboscis two verses out of Ovid  Militat omnis amans habet et sua castra Cupido  Pontice crede mihi militat omnis amans  It is reported that Talicotius had at one time in his house twelve German counts nineteen French marquisses and a hundred Spanish cavaliers besides one solitary English esquire of whom more hereafter Though the doctor had the monopoly of noses in his own hands  he is said not to have been unreasonable Indeed if a man had occasion for a high Roman nose he must go to the price of it A carbuncle nose likewise bore an excessive rate but for your ordinary short turnedup noses of which there was the greatest consumption they cost little or nothing at least the purchasers thought so who would have been content to have paid much dearer for them rather than to have gone without them  The sympathy betwixt the nose and its parent was very extraordinary Hudibras has told us that when the porter died the nose dropped of course in which case it was always usual to return the nose in order to have it interred with its first owner The nose was likewise affected by the pain as well as death of the original proprietor An eminent instance of this nature happened to three Spaniards whose noses were all made out of the same piece of brawn They found them one day shoot and swell extremely upon which they sent to know how the porter did and heard upon enquiry that the parent of the noses had been severely kicked the day before and that the porter kept his bed on account of the bruises it had received This was highly resented by the Spaniards who found out the person that had used the porter so unmercifully and treated him in the same manner as if the indignity had been done to their own noses In this and several other cases it might be said that the porters led the gentlemen by the nose  On the other hand if any thing went amiss with the nose the porter felt the effects of it insomuch that it was generally articled with the patient that he should not only abstain from all his old courses but should on no pretence whatsoever smell pepper or eat mustard on which occasion the part where the incision had been made was seized with unspeakable twinges and prickings  The Englishman I before mentioned was so very irregular and relapsed so frequently into the distemper  which at first brought him to the learned Talicotius that in the space of two years he wore out five noses and by that means so tormented the porters that if he would have given  l  for a nose there was not one of them that would accommodate him This young gentleman was born of honest parents and passed his first years in foxhunting but accidentally quitting the woods and coming up to London he was so charmed with the beauties of the playhouse that he had not been in town two days before he got the misfortune which carried off this part of his face He used to be called in Germany the Englishman of five noses and the gentleman that had thrice as many noses as he had ears such was the raillery of those times  I shall close this paper with an admonition to the young men of this town which I think the more necessary because I see several new freshcoloured faces that have made their first appearance in it this winter I must therefore assure them that the art of making noses is entirely lost and in the next place beg of them not to sollow the example of our ordinary townrakes who live as if there was a Talicotius to be met with at the corner of every street Whatever young men may think the nose is a very becoming part of the face and a man makes but a very silly figure without it But it is the nature of youth not to know the value of any thing till they have lost it The general precept therefore I shall leave with them is to regard every townwoman as a particular kind of siren that has a design upon their noses and that amidst her flatteries and allurements they will fancy she speaks to them in that humorous phrase of old Plautus  Ego tibi faciem denasabo mordicus  Keep your face out of my way or I'll bite off your nose  No Tuesday December  Verba togae sequeris junctura callidus acri  Ore teres modico pallentes radere mores  Doctus et ingenuo culpam defigere ludo  Pers Sat  Journal of the Court of Honour  etc  TIMOTHY TREATALL gent was indicted by several ladies of his sister's acquaintance for a very rude affront offered to them at an entertainment to which he had invited them on Tuesday the  th  of November last past between the hours of eight and nine in the evening The indictment set forth that the said Mr Treatall upon the serving up of the supper desired the ladies to take their places according to their different age and seniority for that it was the way always at his table to pay respect to years The indictment added that this produced an unspeakable confusion in the company for that the ladies who before had pressed together for a place at the upper end of the table immediately crouded with the same disorder towards the end that was quite opposite that Mrs Frontly had the insolence to clap herself down at the very lowest place of the table that the widow Partlett seated herself on the right hand of Mrs Frontly alleging for her excuse that no ceremony was to be used at a round table that Mrs Fidget and Mrs Fescue disputed above half an hour for the same chair and that the latter would not give up the cause till it was decided by the parish register which happened to be kept hard by The indictment further said that the rest of the company who sate down did it with a reserve to their right which they were at liberty to assert on another occasion and that Mrs Mary Pippe an old maid was placed by the unanimous vote of the whole company at the upper end of the table from whence she had the confusion to behold several mothers of families  among her inferiors The criminal alleged in his defence that what he had done was to raise mirth and avoid ceremony and that the ladies did not complain of his rudeness till the next morning having eaten up what he had provided for them with great readiness and alacrity The censor frowning upon him told him that he ought not to discover so much levity in matters of a serious nature and upon the jury's bringing in him guilty sentenced him to treat the whole assembly of ladies over again and to take care that he did it with the decorum which was due to persons of their quality  Rebecca Shapely spinster was indicted by Mrs Sarah Smack for speaking many words reflecting upon her reputation and the heels of her silk slippers which the prisoner had maliciously suggested to be two inches higher than they really were The prosecutor urged as an aggravation of her guilt that the prisoner was herself guilty of the same kind of forgery which she had laid to the prosecutor's charge for that she the said Rebecca Shapely did always wear a pair of steel bodice and a false rump The censor ordered the slippers to be produced in open court where the heels were adjudged to be of the statutable size He then ordered the grand jury to search the criminal who after some time spent therein acquitted her of the bodice but found her guilty of the rump upon which she received sentence as is usual in such cases  William Trippitt  esq  of the Middle Temple brought his action against the lady Elizabeth Prudely for having refused him her hand as he offered to lead her to her coach from the opera The plaintiff set forth that he had entered himself into the list of those volunteers who officiate every night behind the boxes as gentlemenushers of the playhouse that he had been at a considerable charge in white gloves periwigs and snuffboxes in order to qualify himself for that employment and in hopes of making his fortune by it The council for the defendant replied that the plaintiff had given out that he was within a month of wedding their client and that she had  refused her hand to him in ceremony lest he should interpret it as a promise that she would give it him in marriage As soon as their pleadings on both sides were finished the censor ordered the plaintiff to be cashiered from his office of gentlemanusher to the playhouse since it was too plain that he had undertaken it with an ill design and at the same time ordered the defendent either to marry the said plaintiff or to pay him half a crown for the new pair of gloves and coachhire that he was at the expence of in her service  The lady Townly brought an action of debt against Mrs Flambeau for that Mrs Flambeau had not been to see the said lady Townly and wish her joy since her marriage with Sir Ralph notwithstanding she the said lady Townly had paid Mrs Flambeau a visit upon her first coming to town It was urged in the behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff had never given her any regular notice of her being in town that the visit she alleged had been made on a Monday which she knew was a day on which Mrs Flambeau was always abroad having set aside that only day in the week to mind the affairs of her family that the servant who enquired whether she was at home did not give the visiting knock that it was not between the hours of five and eight in the evening that there were no candles lighted up that it was not on Mrs Flambeau's day and in short that there was not one of the essential points observed that constitute a visit She further proved by her porter's book which was produced in court that she had paid the lady Townly a visit on the twenty fourth day of March just before her leaving the town in the year for which she was still creditor to the said lady Townly To this the plaintiff only replied that she was now only under covert and not liable to any debts contracted when she was a single woman Mr Bickerstaffe finding the cause to be very intricate and that several points of honour were likely to arise in it he deferred giving judgment upon it till the next session day at which time he ordered the  ladies on his left hand to present to the court a table of all the laws relating to visits  Winifred Leer brought her action against Richard Sly for having broken a marriage contract and wedded another woman after he had engaged himself to marry the said Winifred Leer She alleged that he had ogled her twice at an opera thrice in St James's church and once at Powel's puppetshow at which time he promised her marriage by a sideglance as her friend could testify that sate by her Mr Bickerstaffe finding that the defendant had made no further overture of love or marriage but by looks and ocular engagement yet at the same time considering how very apt such impudent seducers are to lead the ladies hearts astray ordered the criminal to stand upon the stage in the Haymarket between each act of the next opera there to be exposed to public view as a false  ogler  Upon the rising of the court Mr Bickerstaffe having taken one of these counterfeits in the very fact as he was ogling a lady of the grand jury ordered him to be seized and prosecuted upon the statute of ogling He likewise directed the clerk of the court to draw up an edict against these common cheats that make women believe they are distracted for them by staring them out of countenance and often blast a lady's reputation whom they never spoke to by saucy looks and distant familiarities  Sir Richard Steele assisted in this paper  No Tuesday December  Arbiter hic igitur factus de lite jocosa  Ovid Met  Continuation of the journal of the Court of Honour etc  AS soon as the court was sate the ladies of the bench presented according to order a table of all the laws  now in force relating to visits and visitingdays methodically digested under their respective heads which the censor ordered to be laid upon the table and afterwards proceeded upon the business of the day  Henry Heedless  Esq  was indicted by colonel Touchy of her majesty's trainedbands upon an action of assault and battery for that he the said Mr Heedless having espied a feather upon the shoulder of the said colonel struck it off gently with the end of a walkingstaff value three pence It appeared that the prosecutor did not think himself injured till a few days after the aforesaid blow was given him but that having ruminated with himself for several days and conferred upon it with other officers of the militia he concluded that he had in effect been cudgelled by Mr Heedless and that he ought to resent it accordingly The council for the prosecutor alleged that the shoulder was the tenderest part in a man of honour that it had a natural antipathy to a stick and that every touch of it with any thing made in the fashion of a cane was to be interpreted as a wound in that part and a violation of the person's honour who received it Mr Heedless replied that what he had done was out of kindness to the prosecutor as not thinking it proper for him to appear at the head of the trainedbands with a feather upon his shoulder and further added that the stick he had made use of on this occasion was so very small that the prosecutor could not have felt it had he broken it on his shoulders The censor hereupon directed the jury to examine into the nature of the staff for that a great deal would depend upon that particular Upon which he explained to them the different degrees of offence that might be given by the touch of crabtree from that of cane and by the touch of cane from that of a plain hazle stick The jury after a short perusal of the staff declared their opinion by the mouth of their foreman that the substance of the staff was British oak The censor then observing that there was some dust on the skirts of the criminal's coat ordered  the prosecutor to beat it off with his aforesaid oaken plant and thus said the censor I shall decide this cause by the law of retaliation If Mr Heedless did the colonel a good office the colonel will by this means return it in kind but if Mr Heedless should at any time boast that he had cudgelled the colonel or laid his staff over his shoulders the colonel might boast in his turn that he has brushed Mr Heedless jacket or to use the phrase of an ingenious author that he has rubbed him down with an oaken towel  Benjamin Busy of London merchant was indicted by Jasper Tattle  Esq  for having puiled out his watch and looked upon it thrice while the said esquire Tattle was giving him an account of the suneral of the said esquire Tattle's first wife The prisoner alleged in his defence that he was going to buy stocks at the time when he met the prosecutor and that during the story of the prosecutor the said stocks rose above two  per cent  to the great detriment of the prisoner The prisoner further brought several witnesses that the said Jasper Tattle  Esq  was a most notorious story teller that before he met the prisoner he had hindered one of the prisoner's acquaintance from the pursuit of his lawful business with the account of his second marriage and that he had detained another by the button of his coat that very morning till he had heard several witty sayings and contrivances of the prosecutor's eldest son who was a boy of about five years of age Upon the whole matter Mr Bickerstaffe dismissed the accusation as frivolous and sentenced the prosecutor to pay damages to the prisoner for what the prisoner had lost by giving him so long and patient an hearing He further reprimanded the prosecutor very severely and told him that if he proceeded in his usual manner to interrupt the business of mankind he would set a fine upon him for every quarter of an hour's impertinence and regulate the said fine according as the time of the person so injured should appear to be more or less precious  Sir Paul Swash kt was indicted by Peter Double gent for not returning the bow which he received of the said Peter Double on Wednesday the sixth instant at the playhouse in the Haymarket The prisoner denied the receipt of any such bow and alleged in his defence that the prosecutor would oftentimes look full in his face but that when he bowed to the prosecutor he would take no notice of it or bow to some body else that sate quite on the other side of him He likewise alleged that several ladies had complained of the prosecutor who after ogling them a quarter of an hour upon their making a curtsy to him would not return the civility of a bow The censor observing several glances of the prosecutor's eye and perceiving that when he talked to the court he looked upon the jury found reason to suspect that there was a wrong cast in his sight which upon examination proved true The censor therefore ordered the prisoner that he might not produce any more confusions in public assemblies never to bow to any body whom he did not at the same time call to by his name  Oliver Bluff and Benjamin Browbeat were indicted for going to fight a duel since the erection of the Court of Honour It appeared that they were both taken up in the street as they passed by the court in their way to the fields behind Montaguehouse The criminals would answer nothing for themselves but that they were going to execute a challenge which had been made above a week before the Court of Honour was erected The censor finding some reasons to suspect by the sturdiness of their behaviour that they were not so very brave as they would have the court believe them ordered them both to be searched by the grand jury who found a breastplate upon the one and two quires of paper upon the other The breastplate was immediately ordered to be hung upon a peg over Mr Bickerstaffe's tribunal and the paper to be laid upon the table for the use of his clerk He then ordered the criminals to button up their bosoms and if they pleased proceed to their duel Upon which they  both went very quietly out of the court and retired to their respective lodgings  The court then adjourned till after the holydays  Copia vera    Charles Lillie  Sir Richard Steele assisted in this paper  No Saturday December  Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit et omnes  Restinxit stellas exortus uti aetherius sol  Lucr  From my own apartment  December  I HAVE heard that it is a rule among the conventuals of several orders in the Romish church to shut themselves up at a certain time of the year not only from the world in general but from the members of their own fraternity and to pass away several days by themselves in settling accounts between their maker and their own souls in cancelling unrepented crimes and renewing their contracts of obedience for the future Such stated times for particular acts of devotion or the exercise of certain religious duties have been enjoined in all civil governments whatever deity they worshipped or whatever religion they professed That which may be done at all times is often totally neglected and forgotten unless fixed and determined to some time more than another and therefore though several duties may be suitable to every day of our lives they are most likely to be performed if some days are more particularly set apart for the practice of them Our church has accordingly instituted several seasons of devotion when time custom prescription and if I may so say the fashion itself call upon a man to be serious and attentive to the great end of his being  I have hinted in some former papers that the greatest and wisest of men in all ages and countries particularly in Rome and Greece were renowned for their piety and virtue It is now my intention to shew how those in our nation that have been unquestionably the most eminent for learning and knowlege were likewise the most eminent for their adherence to the religion of their country  I might produce very shining examples from among the clergy but because priest crast is the common cry of every cavilling empty scribler I shall shew that all the laymen who have exerted a more than ordinary genius in their writings and were the glory of their times were men whose hopes were filled with immortality and the prospect of future rewards and men who lived in a dutiful submission to all the doctrines of revealed religion  I shall in this paper only instance Sir Francis Bacon a man who for the greatness of genius and compass of knowlege did honour to his age and country I could almost say to human nature itself He possessed at once all those extraordinary talents which were divided amongst the greatest authors of antiquity He had the sound distinct comprehensive knowlege of Aristotle with all the beautiful lights graces and embellishments of Cicero One does not know which to admire most in his writings the strength of reason force of style or brightness of imagination  This author has remarked in several parts of his works that a thorough insight into philosophy makes a good believer and that a smattering in it naturally produces such a race of despicable infidels as the little profligate writers of the present age whom I must confess I have always accused to myself not so much for their want of faith as their want of learning  I was infinitely pleased to find among the works of this extraordinary man a prayer of his own composing which for the elevation of thought and greatness of expression  seems rather the devotion of an angel than of a man His principal fault seems to have been the excess of that virtue which covers a multitude of faults This betrayed him to so great an indulgence towards his servants who made a corrupt use of it that it stripped him of all those riches and honours which a long series of merits had heaped upon him But in this prayer at the same time that we find him prostrating himself before the great mercyseat and humbled under afflictions which at that time lay heavy upon him we see him supported by the sense of his integrity his zeal his devotion and his love to mankind which give him a much higher figure in the minds of thinking men than that greatness had done from which he was fallen I shall beg leave to write down the prayer itself with the title to it as it was found among his lordship's papers written in his own hand not being able to furnish my reader with an entertainment more suitable to this solemn time  A Prayer or Psalm made by my Lord Bacon chancellor of England  MOST gracious Lord God my merciful Father from my youth up my Creator my Redeemer my comforter Thou O Lord soundest and searchest the depths and secrets of all hearts Thou acknowlegest the upright of heart Thou judgest the hypocrite Thou ponderest men's thoughts and doings as in a balance Thou measurest their intentions as with a line vanity and crooked ways cannot be hid from Thee  Remember O Lord how thy servant hath walked before thee remember what I have first sought and what hath been principal in my intentions I have loved thy assemblies I have mourned for the divisions of thy church I have delighted in the brightness of thy sanctuary This vine which thy right hand hath planted in this nation I have ever prayed unto Thee that it might have the first and the latter rain and that it might stretch her branches to the seas and to  the floods The state and bread of the poor and oppressed have been precious in mine eyes I have hated all cruelty and hardness of heart I have though in a despised weed procured the good of all men If any have been my enemies I thought not of them neither hath the sun almost set upon my displeasure but I have been as a dove free from superfluity of maliciousness Thy creatures have been my books but thy scriptures much more I have sought Thee in the courts fields and gardens but I have found Thee in thy temples  Thousands have been my sins and ten thousands my transgressions but thy sanctifications have remained with me and my heart through thy grace hath been an unquenched coal upon thine altar  O Lord my strength I have since my youth met with Thee in all my ways by thy fatherly compassions by thy comfortable chastisements and by thy most visible providence As thy favours have encreased upon me so have thy corrections so as thou hast been always near me O Lord And ever as my worldly blessings were exalted so secret darts from Thee have pierced me and when I have ascended before men I have descended in humiliation before Thee And now when I thought most of peace and honour thy hand is heavy upon me and hath humbled me according to thy former lovingkindness keeping me still in thy fatherly school not as a bastard but as a child Just are thy judgments upon me for my sins which are more in number than the sands of the sea but have no proportion to thy mercies for what are the sands of the sea Earth heavens and all these are nothing to thy mercies Besides my innumerable sins I confess before Thee that I am debtor to Thee for the gracious talent of thy gifts and graces which I have neither put into a napkin nor put it as I ought to exchangers where it might have made best profit but mispent it in things for which I was least fit So I may truly say my soul hath been a stranger in the course of my pilgrimage Be merciful unto me O Lord for my Saviour's sake and receive me unto thy bosom or guide me in thy ways  THE END  BOOKS printed and sold by ROBERT URIE at his Printing Office in the foot of the Saltmercat Glasgow
