 ANNA ST IVES  A NOVEL  ANNA ST IVES  A NOVEL  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  VOLUME III  LONDON PRINTED FOR SHEPPERSON AND REYNOLDS NO OXFORDSTREET  MDCCXCII  ANNA ST IVES  A NOVEL  LETTER XLI  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  Chateau de Villebrun  AT last my dear Louisa the charm is broken the spell of silence is dissolved Incapable any longer of restraint passion has burst its bounds and strong though the contest was victory has declared for reason  My change of behaviour has produced this effect Not that I applaud myself on the contrary I am far from pleased with my own want of fortitude I have even assumed an austerity which I did not feel  I do not mean to say that all appearances relative to myself were false No I was uneasy desirous to speak desirous that he should speak and could accomplish neither I accused myself of having given hopes that were seductive and wished to retract In short I have not been altogether so consistent as I ought to be as my letters to you my friend will witness  Various little incidents preceded and indeed helped to produce this swell and overflow of the heart and the eclaircissement  that followed In the morning at breakfast Frank took the cakes I usually eat to hand to me and Clifton whose watchful spirit is ever alert caught up a plate of bread and butter to offer me at the same instant His looks shewed he expected the preference I was sorry for it and paused for a moment At last the principle of not encouraging Frank prevailed and I took some bread and butter from Clifton It was a repetition of slights which Frank had lately met with and he felt it yet he bowed with a tolerable grace and put down his plate  He soon after quitted the room but returned unperceived by me  The young marchioness had breakfasted and retired to her toilet where  some of the gentlemen were attending her She had left a snuffbox of considerable value with me which I had forgotten to return and with that kind of sportive cheerfulness which I rather encourage than repress I called  Here Where are all my esquires I want a messenger  Clifton heard me and Frank was unexpectedly at my elbow Had I known it I should not have spoken so thoughtlessly Frank came forward and bowed Clifton called  Here am I ready fair lady to execute your behests  I was a second time embarrassed After a short hesitation I said  NoI have changed my mind  Frank retired but Clifton advanced  with his usual gaiety answering  Nay nay I have not earned half a crown yet this morning and I must not be cheated of my fare  I would still have refused but I perceived Clifton began to look serious and I said to him  Well well good man here then take this snuffbox to the marchioness she may want it but do not blunder and break it for if you do I shall dismiss you my service Recollect the picture in the lid set with diamonds  It was fated to be a day of mortification to Frank His complaisance had induced him to comply with the request of the marchioness that he would read one of the mad scenes in Lear though he knew she had not the least acquaintance  with the English language But she wanted amusement and was pleased to mark the progress of the passions which I never saw so distinctly and highly expressed as in his countenance when he reads Shakespeare  I happened to come into her apartment for the French are delightfully easy of access and the reading was instantly interrupted I was the very person she wanted to see How should we spend the evening The country was horribly dull There had been no new visitors these two days Should we have a dance I gave my assent and away she ran to tell every body  I followed Frank came after me and with some reluctance foreboding a repulse asked whether he should have  the pleasure to dance with me His manner and the foregone circumstances made me guess his question before he spoke  My answer wasI have just made a promise to myself that I will dance with Mr Clifton  It was true the thought had passed through my mind  Mr Clifton madam  Yes  Youyou  I have not seen Mr Clifton RightBut I said I had made the promise to  myself  Poor Frank could contain no longer I see madam said he I am despised and I deserve contempt I crouch to it I invite it and have obtained a full portion of itYet whyWhat have I  doneWhy is this sudden changeThe false glitter that deceives mankind then is irresistibleBut surely madam justice is as much my due as if my name were Clifton Spurn me trample on me when I sully myself by vice and infamy But till then I should once have hoped to have escaped being humbled in the dust by one whom I regarded as the most benignant as well as the most deserving and equitable of earthly creatures  This is indeed a heavy charge and I am afraid much of it is too true Here is company coming I am sorry I cannot answer it immediately  I can suffer any thing rather than exist under my present tortures Will you favour me so far madam as to grant me half an hour's hearing  Willingly It is what I wish Come to my apartment after dinner  Clifton came up and I have no doubt read in our countenances that something more than common had passed Indeed I perceived it or thought so but his imagination took another turn in consequence of my informing him that I had been just telling Frank I had promised myself to be his Clifton's partner He thanked me his countenance shewed it as well as his words for my kindness He was coming he said to petition the instant he had heard of the dance But still he looked at Frank as if he thought it strange that I should condescend to account to him for my thoughts and promises  Dinner time came and we sat down  to table But the mind is sometimes too busy to attend to the appetites I and Frank ate but little He rose first from table that he might not seem to follow me His delicacy never slumbers I took the first opportunity to retire Frank was presently with me and our dialogue began The struggle of the feelings ordained that I should be the first speaker  I have been thinking very seriously Frank of what you said to me this morning  Would to heaven you could forget it madam  Why so  I was unjust A madman A vain fool An idiotPardon this rude vehemence but I cannot forgive myself  for having been so ready to accuse one whom I cannot speak my feelingsI have deserted myselfI am no longer the creature of reason but the child of passionMy mind is all tumult all incongruity  You wrong yourself The error has been mutual or rather I have been much the most to blame I am very sensible of and indeed very sorry for my mistakeIndeed I amI perceived you indulging hopes that cannot be realized and  Cannot madam  NeverI can see you think yourself despised but you do yourself great wrong  My mind is so disturbed by the abrupt and absurd folly with which I  accused you unheard this morning that it is less now in a state to do my cause justice than at any other timeStill I will be a manYour word madam wasCannot  It was  Permit me to ask is it person  Nocertainly not Person would with me be always a distant consideration You Louisa know how very far from exceptionable the person of Frank is if that were any part of the question  You are no flatterer madam and you have thought proper occasionally to express your approbation of my morals and mind  Yet my expressions have never equalled my feelingsNever  Then madam where is the impossibility In what does it consist The world may think meanly of me for the want of what I myself hold in contempt but surely you cannot join in the world's injustice  I cannot think meanly of you  I have no titles I am what pride calls nobody the son of a man who came pennyless into the service of your family in which to my infinite grief he has grown rich I would rather starve than acquire opulence by the efforts of cunning flattery and avarice and if I blush for any thing relative to family it is for that I am either above or below the wish of being what is insolently called well born  You confound or rather you do not separate two things which are very distinct  that which I think of you and that which the world would think of me were I to encourage hopes which you would have me indulge  Your actions madam shew how much and how properly you disregard the world's opinion  But I do not disregard the effects which that opinion may have upon the happiness of my father my family myself and my husband if ever I should marry  If truth and justice require it madam even all these ought to be disregarded  Indubitably  Did I know a man upon the face of the earth who had a still deeper sense of your high qualities and virtues than I  have who understood them more intimately would study them emulate them more and profit better by them I have confidence enough in myself to say I would resign you without repining But when I think on the union between mind and mindthe aggregate I want language madam  I understand you  When I reflect on the wondrous happiness we might enjoy while mutually exerting ourselves in the general cause of virtue I confess the thought of renouncing so much bliss or rather such a duty to myself and the world is excruciating torture  Your idea of living for the cause of virtue delights me it is in full concord with my own But whether that great  cause would best be promoted by our union or not is a question which we are incapable of determining though I think probabilities are for the negative Facts and observation have given me reason to believe that the too easy gratification of our desires is pernicious to mind and that it acquires vigour and elasticity from opposition  And would you then upon principle madam marry a man whom you must despise  No not despise If indeed I were all I could wish to be I am persuaded I should despise no one I should endeavour to instruct the ignorant and reform the erroneous However I will tell you what sort of a man I should wish to marry First he must be a person  of whom no prejudice no mistake of any kind should induce the world that is the persons nearest and most connected with me in the world to think meanlyShall I be cited by the thoughtless the simple and the perverse in justification of their own improper conductYou cannot wish it FrankNor is this the most alarming fearMy friendsMy relationsMy fatherTo incur a father's reproach for having dishonoured his family were fearful but to meet to merit to live under his curseGod of heaven forbid  Must we then never dare to counteract mistake Must mind though enlightened by truth submit to be the eternal slave of errorWhat is there that is thus dreadful madam in the curse of  prejudice Have not the greatest and the wisest of mankind been cursed by ignorance  It is not the curse itself that is terrible but the torture of the person's mind by whom it is utteredNor is it the torture of a minute or a day but of yearsHis child his beloved child on whom his hopes and heart were fixed to whom he looked for all the bliss of filial obedience all the energies of virtue and all the effusions of affection to see himself deserted by her unfeelingly deserted plunged in sorrows unutterable eternally dishonoured the index and the byeword of scandal scoffed at for the fault of her whom his fond and fatherly reveries had painted faultless whispered out of society because  of the shame of her in whom he gloried and I this child  Were the conflict what your imagination has figured it madam your terrors would be justBut I have thought deeply on it and know that your very virtues misguide you It would not be torture nor would it be eternalOn the contrary madam I poor as I am in the esteem of an arrogant world I proudly affirm it would be the less and not the greater evil  You mistakeIndeed Frank you mistakeThe fear of poverty the sneers of the world ignominy itself were the pain inflicted but confined to me I would despise But to stretch my father upon the rack and with him every creature that loves me even you  yourselfIt must not beIt must not be  I too fatally perceive madam your mind is subjected by these phantoms of fear  No nonot phantoms real existences the palpable beings of reasonBeside what influence have I in the world except over my friends and family And shall I renounce this little influence this only power of doing good in order to gratify my own passions by making myself the outcast of that family and of that world to whom it is my ambition to live an exampleMy family and the world are prejudiced and unjust I know it But where is the remedy Can we work miracles Will their prejudices vanish at  our biddingI have already mortally offended the most powerful of my relations Lord FitzAllen by refusing a foolish peer of his recommendation He is my maternal uncle proud prejudiced and unforgiving Previous to this refusal I was the only person in our family whom he condescended to notice He prophesied in the spleen of passion I should soon bring shame on my family and I as boldly retorted I would never dishonour the name of St IvesI spoke in their own idiom and meant to be so understoodRecollect all thisBe firm be just to yourself and meIndeed indeed Frank it is not my heart that refuses you it is my understanding it is principle it is a determination not to do that which my  reason cannot justifyJoin with me FrankResolveGive me your handLet us disdain to set mankind an example which would indeed be a virtuous and a good one were all the conditions understood but which under the appearances it would assume would be criminal in the extreme  My hand and heart madam are everlastingly yours and it is because this heart yearns to set the world an example higher infinitely than that which you propose that thus I pleadThis opportunity is my first and lastI read my doomBear with me therefore while I declare my sensations and my thoughtsThe passion I feel is as unlike what is usually meant by love as day to night grace to deformity or truth to falsehood  It is not your fine form madam supremely beautiful though you are which I love At least I love it only as an excellent part of a divine whole It is your other your better your more heavenly self to which I have dared to aspire I claim relationship to your mind and again declare I think my claims have a right which none of the false distinctions of men can supersede Think then madam again I conjure you think ere you decideIf the union of two people whose pure love founded on an unerring conviction of mutual worth might promise the reality of that heaven of which the world delights to dream whose souls both burning with the same ardour to attain and to diffuse excellence would mingle and act with incessant  energy who having risen superior to the mistakes of mankind would diffeminate the same spirit of truth the same internal peace the same happiness the same virtues which they themselves possess among thousands who would admire animate emulate each other whose wishes efforts and principles would all combine to one great end the general good who being desirous only to dispense blessings could not fail to enjoy if a union like this be not strictly conformable to the laws of eternal truth or if there be any arguments any perils any terrors which ought to annul such a union I confess that the arguments the perils the terrors and eternal truth itself are equally unknown to me  We paused for a moment The beauty force and grandeur of the picture he had drawn staggered me Yet it was but a repetition of what had frequently presented itself to my mind in colours almost as vivid as those with which he painted I had but one answer and replied  The worldMy familyMy fatherI cannot encounter the malediction of a fatherWhat Behold him in an agony of cursing his childImagination shudders and shrinks from the guilty picture with horrorI cannotI cannotIt must not beTo foresee this misery so clearly as I do and yet to seek it would surely be detestable guilt  Again we pausedHe perceived my  terrors were too violent to cede to any efforts of supposed reason His countenance changed the energy of argument disappeared and was succeeded by all the tenderness of passion The decisive moment the moment of trial was come His features softened into that form which never yet failed to melt the heart and he thus continued  To the scorn of vice the scoffs of ignorance the usurpations of the presuming and the contumelies of the proud I have patiently submitted but to find my great and as I thought infallible support wrested from me to perceive that divine essence which I imagined too much a part of myself to do me wrong overlooking me rejecting me dead to those sensations which I thought mutually  pervaded and filled our hearts to hear her whom of all beings on earth I thought myself most akin to disclaim me positively persistingly un  UnjustlyWas that the word FrankSurely not unjustlyOh surely not  And could those heavenly those heartwinning condescensions on which I founded my hopes be all illusoryCould theyDid I dream that your soul held willing intercourse with mine beaming divine intelligence upon me Was it all a vision when I thought I heard you pronounce the ecstatic sentence  You could love me if I would let you  No it was real I revoke nothing that I have said or done Do not  Frank for the love of truth and justice do not think me insensible of your excellence dead to your virtues or blind to mind and merit which I never yet saw equalledThink not it is pride or base insensibility of your worth Where is the day in which that worth has not increased upon meUnjust to youOhNo no noMy heart bleeds at the thoughtNoIt is my love of you my love of your virtues your principles and these alone are lovely which has rendered me thus inflexible If any thing could make you dearer to me than you are it must be weakness it must be something which neither you nor I ought to approve All the good or rather all the opportunities of doing good which mortal or immortal being can enjoy  do I wish you Oh that I had prayers potent enough to draw down blessings on youLove youYesThe very idea bursts into passion The tears Louisa were streaming down my cheeks Why should you doubt of all the affection which virtue can bestow Do you not deserve itOh yesLove you in the manner you could wish I must not dare not ought not but as I ought I love you infinitely Ay dear dear Frank as I ought infinitely  LouisaBlame me if thou wiltBut I kissed himThe chastity of my thoughts defied misconstruction and the purity of the will sanctified the extravagance of the act A daring enthusiasm seized me I beheld his passions struggling  to attain the very pinnacle of excellence I wished to confirm the noble emulation to convince him how different the pure love of mind might be from the meaner love of passion and I kissed him I find my affections my sensibilities peculiarly liable to these strong sallies Perhaps all minds of a certain texture are subject to such rapid and almost resistless emotions and whether they ought to be encouraged or counteracted I have not yet discovered But the circumstance unexpected and strange as it was suffered no wrong interpretation in the dignified soul of Frank With all the ardour of affection but chastened by every token of delicacy he clasped me in his arms returned  my kiss then sunk down on one knee and exclaimedNow let me die  After a moment's pause I answeredNo Frank Live Live to be a blessing to the world and an honour to the human race  I took a turn to the window and after having calmed the too much of feeling which I had suffered to grow upon me I continued the conversation  I hope Frank we now understand each other and that as this is the first so it will be the last contention of the passions in which we shall indulge ourselves  Madam though  I still think nay feel a certainty of conviction that you act from mistaken principles  yet you support what  you are persuaded is truth with such high such selfdenying virtue that not to applaud not to imitate you would be contemptible You have and ought to have a will of your own You practise what you believe to be the severest precepts of duty with more than human fortitude You resolve in this particular not to offend the prejudices of your family and the world I submit To indulge sensibility but a little were to be heartbroken But no personal grief can authorise me in deserting the post I am placed in nor palliate the crime of neglecting its duties  To the end of time I shall persist in thinking you mine by right  but I will never trouble you more with an assertion of that rightNeverUnless some new and unexpected claim  should spring up of which I see no probability  He bowed and was retiring  Stay Frank I have something more to say to youI have a requisition to make which after what has passed would to common minds appear unfeeling and almost capricious cruelty but I have no fear that yours should be liable to this mistake Recollect but who and what you are remember what are the best purposes of existence the noblest efforts of mind and then refuse me if you canI have formed a project and call upon you for aidCannot you guess  Mr Clifton madam  Yes  I fear it is a dangerous one and whether my fears originate in selfishness  or in penetration they must be spoken Yes madam I must warn you that the passions of Mr Clifton are in my opinion much more alarming than the resentment of your father  But they are alarming only to myself And ought danger to deter me  Not if the good you design be practicable  And what is impracticable where the will is resolved  Perhaps nothingBut the effort must be great must be uncommon  Has he not a mind worthy of such an effort Would not his powers highly honour truth and virtue  They would  Will not you give me your assistance  I would madam most willingly  would he but permit me But I am his antipathy a something noxious an evil augury  You have been particular in your attentions to me  And must those attentions cease madam  They must be moderated they must be cool dispassionate and then they will not alarmI cannot possibly be deceived in supposing it a duty an indispensable duty to restore the mind of Clifton to its true station If I fail the fault must be my own I am but young yet many men have addressed me with the commonplace language of admiration love and I know not what or rather they knew not what and except yourself Frank I have not met with one  from whom half so much might be hoped as from Clifton He is the brother of my bosom friend Surely Frank it is a worthy taskJoin with meThere is but one thing I fear Clifton is haughty and intemperate Are you a duellist Frank  No madam  Then you would not fight a duel  Never madam No provocation not the brand of cowardice itself shall ever induce me to be guilty of such a crime  FrankOh excellent noble youth  Here Louisa our conversation abruptly ended The company had risen from table and we heard them in the corridor I requested him to retire and he instantly obeyed  Oh Louisa with what sensations did he leave my mind glowingHis conviction equals certainty  that I act from mistaken principlesTo the end of time he shall persist in thinking me his by right  Can the power of language afford words more strong more positive more pointedHow unjust have I been to my causeFor surely I cannot be in an error'Tis afflicting 'tis painful nay it is almost terrifying to remember  Persist to the end of time  Why did I not think more deeplyI had a dark kind of dread that I should failIt cannot be the fault of my causeWrong himGuilty of injustice to himSurely surely I hope notWhat Become an example to the feeble and the foolish for having indulged  my passions and neglected my dutiesIHis mind had formed a favourite plan and could I expect it should be instantly relinquishedI cannot conceive torment equal to the idea of doing him wrongHimAgain and again I hope not I hope not I hope not  Then the kiss Louisa Did I or did I not do right in shewing him how truly I admire and love his virtues Was I or was I not guilty of any crime when in the very acme of the passions I so totally disregarded the customs of the world Or rather for that is the true question could it produce any other effect than that which I intended I am persuaded it could not Nor blame me who will do I repent And yet my friend if you should think it wrong I confess I should  then feel a pang which I should be glad not to deserve But be sincere Though I need not warn you No false pity can or ought to induce you to desert the cause of truth  AdieuMy mind is not so much at its ease as I hoped from this conversation but at all times and in all tempers believe me to be ever and ever  Your own dear A W ST IVES  LETTER XLII  FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD  Chateau de Villebrun  ALL is overMy hopes are at an endI am awakened from a dream in which pain and pleasure were mingled to such excess as to render its continuance impossible  Nor is this all This trial severe as it was did not suffice To the destruction  of hope has been added the assault of insolence accompanied with a portion of obloquy which heart scarcely can sustainOh this CliftonButPatience  Yet let me do her justice Mistaken though I am sure she is the motives of her conduct are so pure that even mistake itself is lovely in her and assumes all the energy all the dignity of virtue Oh what a soul is hers Her own passions the passions of others when she acts and speaks are all in subjection to principle Yes Oliver of one thing at least she has convinced me she has taught me or rather made me feel how poor a thing it is to be the slave of desire  Not that I do not still adore herAy more than ever adore But from  henceforth my adoration shall be worthy of herself and not degrading to me From her I have learned what true love is and the lesson is engraven on my heart She can consider personal gratification with apathy yet burn with a martyr's zeal for the promotion of universal good  And shall I not rise equal to the bright example which she has set me Shall I admire yet not imitate  Did she despise me Did she reject me for my own sakeNoAll the affection which mind can feel for mind she has avowed for me And shall I grieve because another may be more happyAnd why moreIn whatIs not the union of souls the first the most permanent of all alliances That  union is mine No power can shake it She openly acknowledges it and has done daily hourly in every word in every action Whither then would my wishes wander  Oliver I am a man and subject to the shakes and agues of his fragile natureYet it is a poor a wretched plea a foolish and a false plea Man is weak because he is willing to be weak He crouches to the whip and like a coward pities while he lashes himself His wilful phrensy he calls irresistible and weeps for the torments which he himself inflicts  But once again this CliftonRead and tell me how I ought to actI have received a blow from him OliverYes  have tamely submitted to receive a blow  What intolerable prejudices are these Why does my heart rebel so sternly at what virtue so positively approves  I had just left her had that instant been rejected by her for his sake had been summoned to aid her in weeding out error from his mind She shewed me it was a noble task and communicated to me her own divine ardour Yes Oliver I came from her with a warmed and animated heart participating all her zeal The most rigid the most painful of all abstinence was demanded from me but should I shrink from a duty because I pity or because I love myself No Such pusillanimity  were death to virtue I left her while my thoughts glowed with the ardour of emulating her heroism and burned to do him all the good which she had projected  He was at the end of the corridor and saw me quit her apartment His hot spirit caught the alarm instantaneously and blazed in his countenance He accosted me  So sir You are very familiar with that lady What right have you to intrude into her apartments  When she herself desires me sir I have a right  She desire you 'Tis false  Sir  'Tis false sir  False  Yes sir And falsehood deserves to be chastised  Chastised It is in vain Oliver to endeavour to conceal the truth from myself my folly incurred its own punishmentI repeated Chastised I was lunatic enough to walk up to him with a ridiculous and despicable air of defiance He reechoed my words and instantly in contempt struck me on the cheek with the back of his hand  Yes sir chastised  His rashness restored me to some sense of the farcical heroism which I had been aping I hurried from him without another word  Oliver I can conceive nothing more  painful than this wresting this tearing of passion from its purpose  I walked a few minutes to calm my thoughts and wrote him the following note  SIR  I FEEL at present the humility of my situation but not from your blow for that has brought me to myself not humbled me No man can be degraded by another it must be his own act and you have degraded yourself not me My error is in having for a moment yielded to the impulse of passion If you think I fear you continue to think so till I can shew my forbearance is from a better motive Cowardice might make me kill you  but true courage will teach me calmly to hear the world call me coward rather than commit an act so wicked so abhorred as that of taking or of throwing away life I wished to seek your friendship and even now I will not shun you Make the world imagine me a coward imagine me one yourself if you can I will live under the supposed obloquy and leave the tenor of my life to shew whether living be the act of fear or of reason I pardon you sir and leave you to pardon yourself  F HENLEY  My forbearance and this letter mitigated my sense of pain Yet I am very ill satisfied with myself Am I so easily  to be moved 'Tis true the scene I had just quitted was fermenting as it were in my veins and shaking my whole system  What is worse I am child enough to be tormented in my own despite by the recollection of having received a blow And why In many countries and even in my own among the class in which I was born the stigma is none or triflingStigma AbsurdCowardiceMurderIf vanity were ever becoming I have perhaps more reason to be vain considering the danger to which I had exposed myself of this than of any act of my life  Well well OliverI hope these agitations are over and that from this time thou wilt begin to think better of me  I communicate my whole thoughts to thee If the experiments made upon my mind can be of any use to thine my letters will then answer the best of the purposes for which they are written  F HENLEY  LETTER XLIII  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  Chateau de Villebrun  YOUR last Fairfax pleased me You say truly and I like your remark  Such fellows ought not to claim a moment's attention from me I should brush them away like flies from my forehead when they presume to tease or settle themselves upon me  I have taken  your advice and flyflapped the wasp that was more willing than able to sting  I have lately grown dissatisfied with myself I know not how or why I suspect this youth in part has made me so with his visionary morality I hate such sermonizing Who has a right to control me Whose slave am I I was born to rule not to be ruled My appetites are keen my desires vast and I would enjoy Why else am I here Delay to me is insufferable suspense distracts me and the possibility that another should be preferred to myself drives me mad I too heartily despise the tame creatures that crawl upon the earth to suffer opposition from them Who would be braved by bats and beetles buzzing in his ears  I never before saw a woman whom any temptation could have induced me to marry and now I have found one I am troubled with doubts infested with fears and subjected to the intolerable penance of procrastination Impeded in my course and by what Why I am told to scrutinize myself and to discover whether I am quite as perfect as it is necessary I should be 'Tis unjust 'Tis unkind I did not doubt of her perfections and both love and pride equally jealous of their honour demand that mine should have been taken for granted  The time has been when this would have been revenged But I seem to be half subdued My fierce spirit before so untameable declines contending with  her Not but I frequently feel it struggling with suffocation kindling and again ready to burst into a more furious blaze  Yet let me do her justice Mild gentle and affectionate she conquers my impetuosity with prayers and soothing and with kindness irresistible Still she conquers  Then she suffers these animals to torment me I am angry to think that in so short a space I should have so entirely lost all power over myself  But where is the mortal that can look and not love Were I myself not an actor in the play how should I enjoy the perplexity of these French  amoureux  There are I know not how many of them each more busy than the other  'Tis laughable to see with what industry they labour to make love according to her liking for they find that their own trifling manner is inefficient and can never succeed with her One of them that said crazy Provençal Count is very earnest indeed in his endeavours but she keeps him in due awe And it is well perhaps for him that she does or I would Still however he is damned troublesome and impertinent and I could wish she were more peremptory Yet it is unjust to blame her for the animal is so full of antics that it is impossible to be angry  After all I am far from satisfied respecting myself and this youth whom I condescended to chastise It was beneath me It gave him a sort of right to demand satisfaction but he affects forbearance  because as he pretends he despises duelling And I hear he has actually given proofs of the most undaunted courage He wrote a short note of only three or four sentences on the subject after I had struck him which produced a very uncommon effect upon me and made me half repent and accuse myself of haughtiness rashness and insult  But these things torture me I am out of patience with them What right has any pedant because he thinks proper to vex and entangle his own brain with doubts to force his gloomy dogmas upon me Let those who love sackcloth wear it Must I be made miserable because an overcurious booby bewilders himself in inquiry and galls his conscience till like the wrung withers  of a battered posthorse it shrinks and shivers at the touch of a fly's foot What shall I not enjoy the free air the glorious sun the flowers the fruits the viands the whole stores of nature Who shall impede who shall dare disturb the banquet Were it even a dream the meddling fool that waked me should dearly repent his rashnessLet speculative blockheads brew metaphysical nectar make a hash of axioms problems corollaries and demonstrations and feed on ideas and fatten Be theirs the feast of reason and the flow of soul But let me banquet with old Homer's jolly gods and heroes revel with the Mahometan houris or gain admission into the savoury sanctorum of the gormandizing  priesthood snuff the fumes from their altars and gorge on the fat of lambs Let cynic Catos truss up each his slovenly toga rail at Heliogabalus and fast but let me receive his card with  Sir your company is requested to dine and sup  I cannot forget this gardener's son I am sometimes angry that I should for a single instant trouble myself with a fellow so much beneath me and at others equally angry for not shewing him the respect which he claims There are moments in which I have even feared him as a rival for when she speaks to him which she is very ready to do the usual mildness and benevolence of her voice and features are evidently increased  She must she shall be more circumspect Indeed I have made her so within these few days  Prithee forgive all this My mind is not at ease but I know not why I should infect you with its malady Write relate something pleasant tell me what has happened to you last and relieve the dissatisfaction I feel by your unaffected flow of gaiety Adieu  C CLIFTON  LETTER XLIV  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  Chateau de Villebrun  I CANNOT sufficiently applaud the resolute propriety of Frank since our last conversation Indeed Louisa his fortitude is admirable He does not indulge selfcompassion by brooding over his own loss Nor does he like other mistaken people whose affections have  met disappointment suppose himself into sufferings which swell into existence in proportion as they are imagined to be real His evident determination is not to permit any selfish motive to detach him from the great purposes of life but cheerfully to submit to what is inevitable without thinking it an evil  In the mean time I have been indulging a hope which at moments has appeared almost a certainty that Clifton by our mutual efforts shall acquire all this true ardour which is so lovely in Frank How forry am I to observe that the haughtiness of Clifton and the coldness of Frank seem to be increasing To what can this be attributed Their behaviour is so peculiar that I almost  dread something has happened with which I am unacquainted  But perhaps it is the present temper of my mind the effect of sensations too irritable doubts too tremulous and fears too easily excited I cannot forget the conversation it haunts me and did not Frank set me the example of fortitude I have sometimes doubted of my own perseverance  Oh how mean is this in me Is not the task I have proposed to myself a worthy and a high one Am I not convinced it is an inevitable duty And shall he even under a contrary conviction outstrip me in the careerGenerous and excellent youth I will imitate thy most eminent virtues  The Count de Beaunoir still continues to be particular in what he calls his adoration of me but his tone and style are too romantic to authorize me in any serious remonstrance Clifton is not pleased and the Count and he have fallen into a habit of rallying each other and vaunting of what lovers dare do to prove their affection Their irony took so serious a turn yesterday that Clifton proposed they should load their pistols and both holding by the corner of a handkerchief fire at each other Considering the temper in which they were and the constitutional extravagance of the Count the proposal was terrifying but I had the presence of mind to give it  an air of ridicule by sayingYou do not understand the true point of gallantry gentlemen You should go to Japan where one nobleblooded person draws his sabre and dispatches himself to prove he is acquainted with the high punctilio and very essence of honour while another enraged that he should be in waiting and have a dish to carry up to the emperor's table requests he would condescend to live till he can come down again that he may shew he knows what honour is as well as his disingenuous enemy who had taken such an unfair advantage  The Count laughed and Clifton I should hope was not displeased that it was impossible the conversation should again  assume the same desperate and absurd tone  I took an opportunity to ask him privately how he could indulge such intemperate passions but I was obliged to soften my admonition by all possible mildness I know not whether I did right but I even took his hand pressed it between mine and requested of him with an ardour which I think must sink deeply in his mind to do justice to himself to exert those powers of thought which he certainly possessed and to restrain passions which if not restrained must deter me or any woman worthy of him from a union that would be so dangerous  The impression would have been stronger but that unfortunately his quick sensations took a different turn Feeling  me clasp his hand he dropped on his knee and with an ecstasy which he seemed unable to resist kissed both mine talked something of bliss unutterable and recollecting the conclusion of my sentence added that the very thought of losing me was madness We were interrupted and I began to fear lest my true motive should have been misunderstood  Oh Louisa what a world is this Into what false habits has it fallen Can hypocrisy be virtue Can a desire to call forth all the best affections of the heart be misconstrued into something too degrading for expression  I know not but I begin to fear that no permanent good can be effected at present without peril If so shall I  listen only to my fears shrink into self and shun that which duty bids me encounter No Though the prejudices of mankind were to overwhelm me with sorrows for seeking to do good I will still go on I will persevere will accomplish or die  Yet I know not why I am in this mood But so I am and Louisa will forgive me I talk of sufferings What have I suffered What can those who mature in reason are superior to prejudice suffer  But who are they My prejudices hourly rise up in arms against me Every day am I obliged to combat what the day before I thought I had destroyed Could we at the same moment that we correct our own mistakes correct those  of the whole world the work were done at once But we have to struggle and to struggle and having today shaken off the burs that hung about us tomorrow we give a glance and perceive them sticking as closely and as thick as ever  I wish to question Frank concerning these alarms but he seems purposely to avoid giving me an opportunity Perhaps however I am mistaken and I hope I am The restless fancy is frequently too full of doubts and fears Oh how beautiful is open artless undisguised truth Yet how continually are dissimulation and concealment recommended as virtues Whatever mistakes public or private they may think they have discovered and however beneficial it might be to correct them men must not pubsish  their thoughts for that would be to libel to defame to speak or to write scandal  When will the world learn that the unlimited utterance of all thoughts would be virtuous How many halfdiscovered halfacknowledged truths would then be promulgated and how immediately would mistake of every kind meet its proper antidote How affectionately and unitedly would men soon be brought to join not in punishing nor even in reproving but in reforming falsehood Aided and encouraged by your dear and worthy mother we have often discoursed on these things Louisa and the common accidents of life as well as those peculiar to myself  render such conversations sweet to recollection  I must conclude for though we write best when thoughts flow the most freely yet at present I find myself more inclined to think than to write  Affectionately and ever A W ST IVES  LETTER XLV  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  Chateau de Villebrun  I KNOW not Louisa how to begin I have an accident to relate which has alarmed me so much that I am half afraid it should equally alarm my friend Yet the danger is over and her sensations cannot equal ours She can but imagine what they were But it is so incredible  so mad so dreadful Clifton is strangely rash  He had been for some days dissatisfied restless and disturbed I knew not why except that I had desired time for mutual consideration before I would permit him to speak to Sir Arthur He has half terrified me from ever permitting him to speakBut then he has more than repaired all the wrong he had done There is something truly magnanimous in his temper but it has taken a very erroneous bent The chief subject of my last was the distance which I observed between him and Frank Henley Little did I know the reason But I will not anticipate only remember be not too much alarmed  Frank was but one of the actors  though the true and indeed sole hero of the scene I am going to relate Indeed he is a wonderful I had almost said a divine youth It took birth from the Count de Beaunoir  In my last I mentioned the strange defiance of the pistols and the handkerchief and would you think Louisa a conversation so frantic could be renewed It is true it shewed itself under a new though scarcely a less horrible aspect  We were yesterday walking in the park in which there is a remarkable lake small but romantic I before spoke I believe of our rowing on it in boats We were walking beside it on a steep rock which continues for a considerable  length of way to form one of its banks The Count and Clifton were before I Frank Henley and a party of ladies and gentlemen were following at a little distance but not near enough to hear the conversation that was passing between your brother and the Count  It seems the latter had first begun once again to talk of times of knight errantry and of the feats which the  preux chevaliers  had performed for their ladies The headlong Clifton utterly despising the pretended admiration of what he was persuaded the Count durst in no manner imitate after some sarcastic expressions of his contempt madly but seriously asked the Count if he durst jump off the rock into the lake to prove his own courage  Shew your soul said he if you have any Jump you first said the Count******  Imagine Louisa if you can the shock I received when not knowing what had passed but in an apparent fit of frenzy I saw him desperately rush to the side of the rock and dash himself headlong down into the water It was at an angle and we had a full view of him falling  Every soul I believe shrieked except myself and perhaps Frank Henley Never had I so much need of the fortitude to which I have endeavoured to habituate my mind  The gentlemen all ran to the side of the rockThey saw Clifton after rising to the surface sink He had jumped  from a place where the shelving of the rock under water by projecting had stunned him as he fell  Frank perceived the danger he threw off his hat and coat and ran to another part where the height was still more dreadful Indeed Louisa it excites horror to look at the place But he seems to be superior to fear He plunged down what might well be called an abyss and after rising for a few seconds to breathe dived again in search of poor Clifton  He was twice obliged to rise and take breath The third time he found him rose with him turned him upon his own back and swam with him a very considerable distance before he could find a place shallow enough to land  To all appearance Clifton was lifeless But the excellent most excellent when you shall hear all the heroic Frank immediately applied himself to the remainder of his office He stayed not a moment to rest but lifted him a seeming corpse from the earth threw him once more on his back and ran faster than any of us to the chateau carried him up stairs undressed him himself put him between the blankets and gave every necessary order with as much presence of mind as if there had been neither accident nor danger Wet as he was he lost not a thought upon himself  Never shall I forget the indefatigable assiduity with which he laboured to restore your brother to life the anxiety which he struggled to conceal the variety  of means he employed the ingenuity of his conjectures and the humanity of every motion  Two hours were I and he and all of us held in this dreadful suspense At last he was successful and the relief I felt the load that seemed removed from my heart it is impossible to describe  When your brother was perfectly come to himself Frank suffered him to be bled For it had been proposed before but Frank with a determination that could not be withstood refused to admit of it though he had been intreated and at last openly and loudly blamed by the surgeon and those who believed in him for his pertinacity But Frank was not to be shaken even by the very serious fear of future accusation He followed as  he tells me the opinion of John Hunter and well might he think it of more worth than that of the person who pretended to advise But it requires no common degree of resolution to persist in this manner in the right and wholly to despise calumny and its consequences  If you think Louisa that after this I can add nothing in praise of Frank you are greatly mistaken for what is to come raises his character almost to an enviable dignity  Could you imagine that this very Frank Henley this undaunted determined highsouled Frank who had flung himself down the horrid precipice after your brother who had swum with him run with him risked being supposed in some sort his murderer and at last restored  him to life had the very day before received from the hand of this same brothera blowIf Louisa there be one being upon earth capable of attaining virtues more than human it is surely Frank Henley  Much praise however as well as blame is justly due to Clifton I never saw a heart more painfully wrung by the sense of an injury committed and of a good so unexampled received as his has been It was he who told of his own behaviour His total want of power to make retribution is the theme by which he is pained and oppressed  Frank uniform in generosity disclaims any superiority and affirms Clifton would have done the same had he been in the same danger I think I  would answered Clifton in a tone that shewed he felt what he spoke but I know myself too well to suppose I should have so unremittingly persevered like you in the performance of an office of humanity which seemed hopeless  The distinction was just disinterested and worthy the discernment of a mind like that of your brother  Clifton says that though he cannot think like Frank We hope to make him Louisa yet he cannot but admire the magnanimity with which he acts up to his principles and proves his sincerity  Oh my friend You can conceive all the terrors of the scene So fine a youth so accomplished so brave the brother of my Louisa brought to Paris  to meet an untimely death I the cause of his coming thither I the innocent instigator of this last rash act The eyes of all upon me The horror of suspenseIt was indeed a trial  Yet who knows what accidents may occur in life Who can sufficiently cherish fortitude and by anticipating defy misfortune Violently as my feelings were assaulted there yet may be there are shocks more violent scenes more dreadful in the world Nor is it impossible but that such may be my lot And if they were I hope I still should bear up against them all  It is true I may not always have a Frank Henley to cherish and inspire hope His constant theme was"He is not dead" And I once heard him  murmuring to himself with a kind of prophetic energy"He shall not die"It was this  shall not  by which he was saved for with any other creature upon earth I am persuaded he had been gone for ever Oh this noble perseverance It is indeed a godlike virtue  The Count is less in spirits less extravagant since this accident It seems to hang upon his mind as if he had been outbraved His anxiety as might well be expected from such a temper was excessive while Clifton was in danger but he seems to repent now that he did not follow the mad example  Parbleu Madame je suis Provençal on dit que j'ai la tête un peu chaude mais Messieurs les Anglois vont diablement vite  aux épreuves Mes compatriotes même ne sont pas si fousJe ne suis pas content de moiJ'aurais du faire le sautJ'aurais sauvé la vie à mon rivalVoilà une belle occasion manquée et beaucoup de gloire à jamais perdue pour moi  'Sdeath Madam I am a native of Provence and they tell me I am a little crazy but these Englishmen are in a confounded hurry to come to the proofMy own countrymen are less lunaticI am not satisfied with myself I ought to have leaped after him I should have saved the life of my rival It was losing a glorious opportunity and I have robbed myself of thus much fame for ever  My mind at present is not entirely tranquil The recollection of a temper so rash as Clifton's preys upon me Yet where there are qualities so high and powers so uncommon shall I defpair  Shall I shrink from an act of duty It is a task I have prescribed to myself Shall I witness the fortitude of Frank and be myself so easily discomfited No Louisa Clifton shall be ours  Shall be  Shall be the brother of Louisa the friend of Frank and the better part of Anna Yes I too will be determined I like Frank will say"He is not dead He shall not die"  A W ST IVES  LETTER XLVI  THE HONOURABLE MRS CLIFTON TO FRANK HENLEY  RoseBank  SIR  IF the praises prayers and thanks of a woman whom disease has robbed of more than half her faculties could be of any value if the overflowing heart of a mother could but speak its throbs if admiration of gifts so astonishing and virtues  so divine could be worthy your acceptance or could reward you for all the good you have done us I would endeavour to discharge the unexampled and unmerited obligation  But no sir you are superior to these I write not for your sake but for my own that I may endeavour to relieve myself of sensations that oppress me I feel it incumbent on me to write yet what can I say I have no words I despair of any opportunity of retribution I am aged infirm and feeble I am going down to the grave but still I have life enough to revive and feel a new existence at the recital of your virtues  Forgive this short effusion from the  exuberant heart of a mother who wishes but is wholly unable to say how much she admires you  M CLIFTON  LETTER XLVII  LOUISA CLIFTON TO FRANK HENLEY  RoseBank  SIR  I LIKE my dear mamma am impelled to endeavour to return thanks for benefits at the recollection of which the heart sinks and all thanks become inadequate and vain Yet suffer a sister's thanks for a brother spared pardoned  and restored to life Restored at the hazard of your own and after a mortal affront received Restored by the energies of fortitude sagacity and affection  Indeed sir I cannot tell you what I feel It is utterly impossible Imagine me your friend your sister Command my life it is yours Yours not so much because the youth you have saved happened to be my brother as for the true esteem I have for qualities so exalted This is not the first time you have excited my admiration and permit me to add my love Your heart is too noble to misunderstand me I love virtue in man or woman and if that be sin may I be ever sinful  I would wish you the joys of heaven but my wishes are vain you have them  already nor can a mind like yours be robbed of them by all the powers of man or accident  L CLIFTON  LETTER XLVIII  LOUISA CLIFTON TO ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES  RoseBank  YOUR three last letters my dear Anna have affected me in a very uncommon manner The pure passion the noble resignation and the fortitude of Frank Henley are unparalleled Not to admire not to esteem not to love such virtues is imposible His unshaken  patience his generosity his forgiveness his courage his perseverance are inimitable proofs of his superiority Who can forbear wishing him success Ought he not to command it to say it is mine truth and justice dare not deny it to me  Indeed Anna my mind is strangely in doubt To be guilty of injustice to such worth is surely no common guilt And yet my brotherHeadlong lunatic Whose intemperance is every moment hurrying him into extremesI grant my friend his mind is worthy of being retrieved and it is a generous a noble enterprize Nay I own I sometimes persuade myself it cannot fail when Anna St Ives and Frank Henley from motives so pure and with so much  determination engage in the cause But at others I see peril at every step I find my heart reproaching me for not adjuring my friend to desist for not exciting her to bestow her hand on the man who of all others can most justly claim it as his right  That I desire to see my brother all that emulation and wisdom could make him the friend and husband of my Anna the rival of her virtues and the bosom intimate of him whom she is willing to forego for this brother's sake that I desire this ardently vehemently is most true If the end be attainable it is a noble enterprize But the difficulties What are they Have they been well examinedI with my Anna say mind can do all things with mind truth is irresistible  and must finally conquer But it has many modes of conquering and some of them are tragical and dreadful  To see my Anna married to strife wasting her fine powers to reform habits which though they may be checked may perhaps be too deep ever to be eradicated to see all her exquisite sensibilities hourly preyed upon by inefficient attempts to do good for which instead of praise and love she might meet neglect reproach or perhaps stern insultOh It is a painful thought She would not pine she would not weakly sink into dejection and desert her duties in pity to her own misfortunesNoBut still it is an unhappy nay it is an abhorred state  I am bewildered One train of reasoning  overturns another and I know not what to advise There are times in which these consequences appear most probable and there are others in which I say no it is impossible Brutality itself could not be so senseless so destructive of its own felicity Anna St Ives would win a savage heart And my brother evidently has quick and delicate sensations capable of great good But then are they not capable of great harm Yes but are they would they be capable of harm with her Would not she command them regulate them harmonize them Again and again I know not  One thing however let me add Let me conjure the friend of my bosom not to suffer herself to be swayed by the remembrance  of that friendship Nay if she do not feel a certainty of success let me intreat let me admonish her to desist before it be too late and before further encouragement shall seem to authorize the presuming Clifton for presuming I am convinced he will be to found claims upon her kindness  Oh that he were indeed worthy of her Would that he could but rise to something like that enviable dignity And can he notIndeed I would not plead against him but neither would I be instrumental in rendering my friend who is surely born a blessing to the earth miserable  I am angry with myself for my own indecision but in vain I have no remedy I sometimes conclude this indecision  ought to act as a warning and for that reason I have painted my feelings as they are If yours should resemble them I firmly and loudly sayAnna desist If not I then have no advice to give For this I blame myself but ineffectually  Be assured however that under all circumstances of future life be they adverse or prosperous my best wishes will be with you and my heart and soul ever yours  L CLIFTON  P S  My mamma and I have mutually written to Frank Henley you may easily imagine in what tone and style But I could wish my brother to see our letters We have both thought it best  to forbear writing to him his temper being wayward and tetchy We would much rather he should be obliged to feel indirectly what our opinions and sensations are than learn them from any formal address which he is so liable to misconstrue It is most probable that Frank will not mention these letters But if you shew him this and being of my opinion will join in the request I have no doubt he will then comply There is one sentence in my letter which makes me likewise wish that Clifton should know I have requested Frank would permit him to see what I have written otherwise that sentence might very probably by him be misinterpreted When you read the letter you will instantly know which I mean the word  love makes it conspicuous and you will then perceive my reason To raise the mind which is habituated to the suspicious practices of the world above those practices and to make it feel that the pure heart defies the pusillanimous imputation of want of delicacy is a difficult task But let us my Anna continue to act and speak all that our thoughts approve void of the fear of accusation  LETTER XLIX  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  Paris Hotel de l'Université  WE are returned to Paris The Marquis and his bride have taken leave of their country pleasures and are gone to Fontainebleau to be presented at court  The strange incident of Clifton excited much conversation in which my name  and his were frequently joined The Count de Beaunoir became less particular in his behaviour to me in consequence of the reserve which I thought it right to assume I find however that he told Sir Arthur after running over a great number of enthusiastic epithets in his wild way all in my praise that he perceived at present I preferred another and that he had too high a sense of honour to put any restraint on a lady's inclinations But if my mind should change and his person fortune sword and life could give me pleasure they should eternally be at my command He likewise means in a few days to follow the court to Fontainebleau as he said and he again repeated he had lost a fine opportunity of convincing  me how he adored me and that he was  diablement fâché  Clifton has entirely altered his behaviour to Frank he now treats him with unaffected freedom and respect But his impatience relative to me has not abated Tomorrow we are to have some conversation after which I imagine he wishes to make proposals to Sir Arthur  Would you think Louisa that I sometimes suffer myself to be surprised into fears and that I then find myself ready to retract or at least questioning whether I ought to proceed  There is something fatally erroneous in the impatient propensities of the human mind How seldom does it stay so fully to examine a question as to leave no remaining doubt and to act on a  preconcerted and consistent plan Yet it never acts with safety or with satisfaction except when it has or imagines it has made this examination If our motives be few slow and feeble we then are heavy dull and stupid if they be quick numerous and strong we are too apt implicitly to obey first impulses and to hurry headlong into folly and extravagance Yet these last only can give energy and having them wisdom will consist in being able to curb them so as to give full time for consideration  The conscious want of this in myself is what I blame How often am I surprised by unexpected circumstances which I ought to have foreseen and against which I ought to have provided If I have any doubts of myself if I am  not certain of producing those effects on the mind of Clifton which I know I ought to be able to produce it becomes me to recede Or rather it becomes me to apply myself with the resolution of which I am so ready to vaunt to attain that which is attainable to discover the true means the clue to his mind and to persevere  I have sometimes suspected myself of being influenced by his fine form and the charms of his wit and gaiety At others I have even doubted whether I were not more actuated by an affection for my Louisa than by a sense of incumbent duty But consider the subject how I will that there is a duty and that I am called upon to fulfil it is an unerring decision  There must be no concealment I must explain my whole chain of reasonings to him for nothing appears more indubitable to me than that duplicity never can conduce to good The only fear is that I should be deficient in my detail and present my plan so as to give it a false appearance Truth partially told becomes falsehood and it was a kind of blind consciousness of this which first induced men to countenance dissimulation They felt their inability to do justice to truth and therefore concluded hypocrisy was a virtue and strange to tell truth itself sometimes a vice It was a lamentable mistake It is partial truth or in other words falsehood which is the vice  Clifton has from the beginning been a  great favourite with Sir Arthur He contradicts none of my father's prejudices he admires grounds and parks beautifully laid out has a taste for architecture points out the defects and excellencies of the buildings of France with much discrimination has a great respect like Sir Arthur for family and prides himself in being the son of an honourable mother recounts in a pleasant and lively manner the anecdotes he has heard and relates his own adventures so as to render them amusing There is therefore no fear of opposition from Sir Arthur  He has another advantage with the family My uncle Lord FitzAllen is at present in Paris on his return from Switzerland and Clifton has been introduced  to him by his kinsman Lord Evelyn who is making a short excursion to the south of France The near relationship of your brother to this noble lord has given him great consequence with my uncle who has once more condescended to restore me to favour Could I or did it become me entirely to conceal those feelings which his arrogance inspires I should stand much higher in his esteem As it is he acts more from the love of his rank and family that is of himself than of me and has accordingly signified his mandatory approbation to Sir Arthur As nothing however in the way of family advantage is to be expected from him he having several children and a prodigious quantity of dignity to maintain his behest is not  altogether so omnipotent as it might otherwise be  My brother agreeably to his grandfather's will has taken possession of the Edgemoor estate which is eight hundred a year This I imagine will oblige Sir Arthur in despite of his predilection to retrench some of his improving expences He mentioned the circumstance to me and I thought that a good opportunity once more to attack his ruling passion Our conversation soon became animated I boldly descanted on the use and abuse of riches on the claims of honest distress and on the turpitude of seeking selfgratifications and neglecting to promote the great ends for which men ought to live the spreading  of truth the rewarding of genius and the propagation of mind  But it was to little purpose Sir Arthur did not understand me and I was more angry at myself than at him as well I might be for wanting the power to render myself intelligible He as usual was amazed to hear he had not a right to do what he pleased with his own and to be told it was not his own Nor was he sparing in pettish reproof to the selfsufficient young lady who thought proper to dispute the propriety and wisdom of his projects  The question that continually occurs to me is when shall those beings who justly claim superiority of understanding and thence a right to direct the world  find some simple and easy mode of convincing the mistaken and by conviction of eradicating error  Adieu Blessings be with you I shall most probably write by the next post for I wish you to be as perfectly acquainted as possible with every thing that passes that I may profit by the advice of a friend so dear so true and so discerning  A W ST IVES  P S  Your last letter is this moment come to hand and has strongly revived trains of ideas that of late have repeatedly passed through my own mind It confirms me in the resolution of being very sincere with your brother But unless my sincerity should so far offend  him as to induce him voluntarily to recede it likewise shews me it is my duty to persist At least such is the result of all the arguments I hold with myself whenever the subject presents itself to me either through the medium of my own imagination or pictured by others I will write soon I approve the reasoning in your postscript will shew it to Frank and will ask him to let me and Clifton see the letters who shall likewise know it is by your desire  LETTER L  SIR ARTHUR ST IVES TO ABIMELECH HENLEY  Paris Hotel de l'Université  I HAVE received yours of the th ult  Omitted  honest Aby and it gave me great pleasure to hear you had made so much dispatch WenbourneHill is the garden of Eden The more I see the more I am convinced What is there here to  be compared to my temples and my groves and my glades Here a mount and a shrubbery There a dell concealed by brambles On your right a statue On your left an obelisk and a sundial The obelisk is fixed yet the dial shews that time is ever flying Did you ever think of that before Aby  Apropos of this dial Sir Alexander I remember said it was useless half the day because it was shaded from the sun to the west and the north by the old grove His advice was that the grove should be grubbed up but it certainly would be much easier to remove the sun dial obelisk and all  I am so delighted with the recollection of these things Abimelech that I had half forgotten the reason of my writing  to you The subject is disagreeable enough and I should not be sorry if I were never to remember it more  I very much fear we must stop our improvements My son has claimed and entered upon the Edgemoor estate I thought myself sure that he would remain satisfied as he was till my death What could be more reasonable I argued with him to the very utmost but to no purpose He is in great haste to set up for himself and I don't know whether he would not eject me out of WenbourneHill if he had the power In vain did I tell him that his pay in the guards added to the three hundred ayear which I had before allowed him was more than any young man knew how properly to spend He has only himself  to think of and he very positively declares he never means to have a family for he will never marry I believe he is quite serious in his declaration and if so what does he want with an estate of eight hundred ayear He ought to consider that and to remember that a provision must be made for his sister But no he considers only himself  Indeed I hear but an indifferent account of him he is a fashionable gentleman and would rather squander his money at the gamingtable than suffer it to remain in the family He has been a wild youth I have sometimes wondered where he got all the money which I am told he has spent Not from me I am sure And though I have often heard of his deep play I do not remember  to have ever heard of his winning But he follows his own course My arguments that I had the family dignity to support his sister to marry and mortgages to pay off were all in vain  He was equally deaf when I pleaded the improvements that I was making all for his sake For you know Aby he is to have them when I am gone and go I must some time or another  He had even the confidence to tell me that if WenbourneHill were his he would quickly undo every thing that I have been doing  Is not this a sad thing Aby For what have I been labouring Have not we both spent our lives in contriving How many charming thoughts have we  had What pleasure have we taken in planting and pulling up digging and scattering watering and draining turfing and gravelling  Talking of water Aby I cannot forbear mentioning a most delightfully romantic lake which I have met with in the park of the Marquis de Villebrun It is the only thing in the laying out of grounds that I have seen to please me in all France One part of it a fine level such a sweep At the other extremity nothing but rocks and precipices Your son Frank threw himself headlong down one of them into the water to save a gentleman's life Were you but to see it you would be astonished They have called it the Englishman's leap I  would not do such a thing for a million of money I should be dead enough if I did  But Frank is a bold young man and I assure you Aby highly esteemed by my daughter ay and by myself too and by every body very highly indeed He was the whole talk for I know not how many days  But about this money Aby I shall soon want a good round sum if I am not mistaken I may venture Aby to give you a hint that I expect very soon indeed I don't know how soon a proposal should be made to me for my daughter and if it be I am so pleased with the party who let me tell you is a fine spirited young fellow that I assure you I shall not think of refusing my consent  especially as he is so much in the good graces of my daughter In this case I cannot do less than pay twenty thousand pounds down  I am afraid honest Aby we must renounce the wilderness But when you know the party I think you will allow I could not act otherwise  Indeed I find however we may please ourselves we can never satisfy our children Here too has Anna been lecturing me about money thrown away as she is pleased to conceive and has said a great deal indeed against what I thought could not have been found fault with But so it is Friends relations children all are wiser than ourselves All are ready enough to discover or to suppose blemishes Would you think it  possible for any body to be acquainted with WenbourneHill and do any thing but admire My hope nay my determination was to have made it the paradise of England and to have drawn strangers far and near to come and be delighted with its beauties But these rubs and crosses put one out of heart with the most excellent thoughts and contrivances  Let me know what you think can be done in these money matters if things should be as I expect You are perfectly acquainted with the state of my affairs I see no way but that of mortgaging more deeply  It is exceedingly vexatious to think of stopping our proceedings Aby But  what can be done However as I do not intend to stay much longer here we can talk more to the purpose on these matters when we meet in England  Perhaps it would be better to begin by discharging the workmen gradually which you will find proper opportunities to do Aby And if you were by way of talk in the neighbourhood to say that you thought nothing more could be done to WenbourneHill and that you had reason to believe that was my opinion likewise such a report might tie the tongues of cavillers for I would not have it thought we stop for want of money  You may write to me here in answer to this for we shall not leave Paris before  your letter will come to hand And so good Abimelech farewell  A ST IVES  P S  I will not tell you the name of the party from whom I expect the proposal honest Aby because if he should be shy of speaking as youngsters sometimes are it might come to nothing but I may hint to you that you are well acquainted with his family and I dare say you will not be sorry for the match it being so agreeable to my daughter's inclination though I grant it may not be so good a one as my sister Wenbourne and others of the family have been expecting because of Anna's beauty and accomplishments which I own might well merit a man of higher birth and  fortune But the little huffy has been so nice and squeamish that I began to fear she would take up her silly spendthrift brother's whim and determine to live single therefore I shall not balk her now she seems in the humour  LETTER LI  ABIMELECH HENLEY TO FRANK HENLEY  WenbourneHill  WHY ay To be sure This will do I shall be fain to think a summut

LIII  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  Paris Hotel de l'Université  YOUR brother has this moment left me Our conversation has been animated and as usual I sit down to commit what has passed to paper while it is fresh on my memory  He began with the warmest expressions of the force of his passion I have  no reason to doubt of their sincerity and if affection can be productive of the end which I hope its strength ought to give me pleasure He would scarcely suffer me to suppose it possible there could be any cause of difference between us let me but name my conditions and they should be fulfilled He would undertake all that I did all that I could require and it was with difficulty that I could persuade him of the possibility of promising too fast This introduced what was most material in our dialogue  My heart assures me madam said he that I never gave you the least cause to suspect the sincerity and ardour of my passion and I should hope that the sears which I have sometimes thought  you too readily entertained are now dissipated  My fears are chiefly for or rather of myself I doubt whether any person has so high an opinion of the powers and energy of your mind as I have but I think those powers ill directed and in danger of being lost  I own madam I have been sometimes grieved nay piqued to perceive that you do not always think quite so well of me as I could wish  You wrong me You yourself do not think so highly of yourself as I do  Yet you suppose me to be in danger  Of being misled Some of my opinions and principles or some of yours are erroneous for they differ I cannot  at this moment but perceive how liable I am to be misunderstood I cannot be insensible of the awkwardness of the situation in which I now place myself My age my sex the customs of the world a thousand circumstances contribute to cast an air of ridicule upon what ought to be very serious But I must persist Do you endeavour to forget these circumstances and consider only the words not the girl by whom they are spoken  It is not you madam but I who ought to dread appearing ridiculous But for your sakeLet me but obtain your favour and make me as ridiculous as you please  I told you soShould the lordly lettered man submit to have his principles  questioned by an untutored woman Be sincere your mind revolts at it  I feel the justness of your satire Men are tyrants  Prejudice is a tyrant there is no other tyranny  Madam  That is one of my strange opinions  It may be true I am willing to think it is Such things are indifferent to me Let me but have your consent to speak to Sir Arthur and I have accomplished all I wish I do not desire to trouble myself with examining opinions true or false I am determined to be of your opinion be it what it will  That is you avow that the gratification  of your desires is the chief pursuit of your life We have now found the essential point on which we differ  Is not happiness madam the universal pursuit Must it not ought it not to be  Yes But the grand distinction is between general and individual happiness The happiness that centres in the good of the whole may for the present find momentary interruption but never can be long subverted while that individual happiness of which almost the whole world is in pursuit is continually blundering mistaking its object losing its road and ending in disappointment  Then madam we must all turn monks preach selfdenial fast pray  scourge away our sins live groaning and die grieving  I smiled It is his usual way when he thinks I am got a little in the clouds to draw some humorous or satirical picture to bring me down to what he esteems commonsense But as I am convinced that truth only need to be repeated and insisted on whenever there is an opportunity in order finally to be received the best way is always to join in the laugh which is inoffensive unless pettishness give it a sting  You find yourself obliged at present to consider me as a whimsical girl with a certain flow of spirits and much vanity desiring to distinguish herself by singularity  No madam Whatever you may think of me my heart will not endure a thought to your disadvantage  Nay nay forbear your kind reproaches Every time you differ with me in sentiment you cannot but think something to my disadvantage It is so with all of us The very end of this present explanation is sincerity We each think well of the other but do we think sufficiently well Is there a certainty that our thoughts are in no danger of changing Of all the actions of private life there is not one so solemn as that of vowing perpetual love yet the heedless levity with which it is daily performed proves that there is scarcely one on which less serious reflection is bestowed Can we be too careful not to deceive ourselves  Ought we not minutely to examine our hopes and expectations Ought not you and I in particular to be circumspect Our imaginations are vivid our feelings strong our views and desires not bounded by common rules In such minds passions if not subdued become ungovernable and fatal  I am very conscious madam  Nay do not fancy I seek to accuse my purpose is very different My mind is no less ardent than yours though education and habit may have given it a different turn It glows with equal zeal to attain its end Where there is much warmth much enthusiasm I suspect there is much danger We had better never meet more than meet to be miserable  For heaven's sake madam do not torture me with so impossible a supposition  You expect one kind of happiness I another Can they coalesce You imagine you have a right to attend to your appetites and pursue your pleasures I hope to see my husband forgetting himself or rather placing selfgratification in the pursuit of universal good deaf to the calls of passion willing to encounter adversity reproof nay death the champion of truth and the determined the unrelenting enemy of error  I think madam I dare do all that can be required of me  I know your courage is high I know too that courage is one of the first and  most essential qualities of mind Yet perhaps I might and ought to doubt nay to ask whether you dare do many things  What is it madam that I dare not do  Dare you receive a blow or suffer yourself falsely to be called lair or coward without seeking revenge or what honour calls satisfaction Dare you think the servant that cleans your shoes is your equal unless not so wise or good a man and your superior if wiser and better Dare you suppose mind has no sex and that woman is not by nature the inferior of man  Madam  Nay nay no compliments I will not be interruptedDare you think that  riches rank and power are usurpations and that wisdom and virtue only can claim distinction Dare you make it the business of your whole life to overturn these prejudices and to promote among mankind that spirit of universal benevolence which shall render them all equals all brothers all stripped of their artificial and false wants all participating the labour requisite to produce the necessaries of life and all combining in one universal effort of mind for the progress of knowledge the destruction of error and the spreading of eternal truth  There is such energy madam in all you say that while I listen to you I dare do any thing dare promise any thing  Nay but the daring of which I speak  must be the energy of your own mind not of mine  Do not distress yourself and me with doubts madam I have heard you yourself say that truth ultimately must prevail I may differ with you in some points but I am willing to hear willing to discuss and if truth be on your side there can be no danger  The only danger is in the feeble or false colouring which the defenders of truth may give it and not in truth itself  I am too well convinced of your power to feel your doubts You oblige me to see with your eyes hear with your ears believe what you believe and reject what you think incredible I am and  must be whatever you please to make me You have but to prescribe your own conditions  Prescribe I must not If I can persuade if I can win upon your mind  If You won my whole soul the very first moment I saw you Not a word or action of mine but what has proclaimed the burning impatience of my passion  True the burning impatienceYour eagerness to assent will not suffer you to examine Your opinions and principles are those which the world most highly approves and applauds mine are what it daily calls extravagant impracticable and absurd It would be weak in me to expect you should implicitly receive remote truths so contradictory to this general practice till you have first deeply  considered them I ask no such miracle But if I can but turn your mind to such considerations if I can but convince you how inestimable they are even to yourself as well as to the world at large I shall then have effected my purpose  Of that madam be sureYou shall seeUpon my honour you shallI will order a furcap a long gown a white wand and a pair of sandals this very day No Grecian ever looked more grave than I will Nay if you desire it razor shall never touch my chin more  Well well equip yourself speedily and I will provide you with a wooden dish a lanthorn and a tub  But then having made your conditions you now grant me your consent  That is obliging me once more to put on my serious faceThe danger in which I so lately saw you hangs heavily on my mind that and the warm passions by which it was occasioned  And my excess of ardour to demonstrate my love you regard as a proof of my having none  How passion overshoots itself Your conclusion is as precipitate as was your proof  I cannot be cool madam on this subject I wonder to see you so Did affection throb and burn in your bosom as it does in mine I am persuaded it would be otherwise  We are neither of us so entirely satisfied with each other as we ought to be  to induce either me to consent or you to apply to Sir Arthur  For heaven's sake madam  Hear me patiently for a moment Previous to this conversation I was convinced of the folly and danger of excessive haste Should you imagine I have any selfcomplacency or caprice to gratify by delay you will do me great injustice I solemnly protest I have none My own interest had I no better motive would make me avoid such conduct The inconsistencies and vain antics of the girl which are justly enough stigmatized by the epithets flirting and coquetry are repaid tenfold upon the wife I would deal openly honestly and generously but not rashly I have every  predilection in your favour which you could wish such doubts excepted as I have declared But I must not give either you or the world cause to accuse me of levity My consent to speak to Sir Arthur would be generally understood as a pledge to proceed not it is true by me if I saw just cause to retract but though I earnestly desire to reform I almost as earnestly wish not unnecessarily to offend the prejudices of mankind  Nay let me beg let me conjure youHe took both my hands with great ardour  And let me beg too let me conjure you not to think meanly or unkindly of me when I tell you that I must insist on a short delay  I will kneel I will do any thing  Do nothing which your heart does not approve it never can be the way to forward any worthy suit For my part I must tell you which you may reckon among my faults that when I have once considered a subject I am a very positive and determined girl This may be thought obstinacy but such I am and such therefore you ought to see me  And when madam may I now presume to hope  Do not speak as if you were displeased Indeed it is far from my intention to offend  You are too well acquainted madam with your own power of pleasing to fear giving offence  Far the contrary for I fear it at this moment  You are kind and killing both in a breathBe doubly kind and suffer me immediately to speak to Sir Arthur  I told you I am fixed and I assure you it is true  When then may I hope  I could have wished to have seen my friend your sister first but perhaps Sir Arthur may make some stay in London and I should be sorry to delay a moment longer than seems absolutely necessary Let us both consider what has passed this morning and provided no new accident should intervene  Another leap from a rock  Provided our approbation and esteem for each other should continue and increase I will ask for no further delay after we come to London  Well well It is the poor lover's duty to thank his mistress for the greatness of her condescension even when he thinks she uses him unkindly  I was going to reply but my enterprising gentlemanIndeed Louisa your brother is a bold youthsnatched an unexpected embrace with more eagerness than fear and then fell on one knee making such a piteous face for forgiveness so whimsical and indeed I may say witty that it was impossible to be serious However I hurried away and thus the conference ended  And now after reviewing what has passed tell me Louisa ought I to recede Are not my hopes well founded Must not the reiteration of truth make its due impression upon a mind like  Clifton's Can it fail Is he not the man who for all the reasons formerly given truly merits preference  I must not forget to tell you that Frank readily complied with your request and Clifton has seen the letters He seems oppressed as it were with a sense of obligation to Frank which the latter endeavours to convince him is wrong Reciprocal duties he says always must exist among mankind but as for obligations further than those there are none A grateful man is either a weak or a proud man and ingratitude cannot exist unless by ingratitude injustice be meant Frank's opinions appear to Clifton to be equally novel with mine and must be well understood to escape being treated with mockery  It is infinitely pleasing to me to perceive the fortitude with which Frank resists inclination He is almost as cheerful and quite as communicative and desirous of making all around him happy as ever His constancy however is not to be shaken in one particular I could wish it were It pains me to recollect that he will  persist to the end of time in thinking me his by right  I cannot proceed  A W ST IVES  LETTER LIV  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  Paris Hotel de l' Université  LAUGH at me if you will Fairfax Hoot Hiss me off the stage I am no longer worthy of the confraternity of honest bold free and successful fellows I am dwindling into a whining submissive crouching very humble yes if you please no thank you Madam dangler I have  been to school Have had my task set me Must learn my lesson by rote or there is a rod in pickle for me Yes I That identical Clifton that bold gay spirited fellow who has so often vaunted of and been admired for his daring You may meet me with my satchel at my back not with a shining but a whindling lackadai sy greensickness face blubbering a month's sorrow after having been flogged by my master beaten by my chum and dropped my plum cake in the kennel  'Tis very true and I cut a damned ridiculous figure But I'll remember it The time will come or say my name is not Clifton  Yet what am I to do I am in for it flounder how I will Yes yes She has  hooked me She dangles me at the end of her line up the stream and down the stream fair water and foul at her good pleasure So be it But I will not forget  Then she has such a way of affronting that curse me if she does not look as if she were doing me a favour nay and while she is present I myself actually think she is and if vexation did not come to my relief I believe I should so continue to think She is the most extraordinary of all heaven's creatures and in despite of my railing I cannot help declaring a most heavenly creature she is Every body declares the same I wish you could but see her for a single moment Fairfax and having gazed could you but listenHer very soul is music Form features  voice all are harmony Then were you to hear her sing and play  But why the devil does she treat me thus It is something to which I am unaccustomed and it does not sit easily upon me If I tamely submit to it may I I lie in my teeth Submit I must bounce how I will I have no remedy  She gives me the preference 'tis true But what sort of a preference Why a cold scrutinizing very considerative all wisdom and no passion preference I do not think there is upon the face of the whole earth so nauseous a thing as an over dose of wisdom mixed up according to the modern practice with a quantum sufficit of virtue and a large double handful of the good of the whole  Yet this is the very dose she prescribes for me Ay and I must be obliged to swallow it too let me make what wry faces I please or my very prudent lady is not so deeply in love but she can recede And shall I not note down this in my tablets  I was sufficiently piqued at the first delay Why delay when I offer Would you have thought Fairfax I should have been so very ready with a tender of this my pleasant person and my dear freedom And could you moreover have thought it would have been so haughtily rejectedNoCurse it Let me do her justice too It is not haughtily She puts as many smiles and as much sweetness and plausibility  into her refusal as heart could desire But refusal it is nevertheless  I must be further just to her I must own that I have acted like a lunaticI am mad at the recollection  I told you of the young fellowFrank HenleyWhom I talked of chastising Curse on my petulance He has doubly chastised me since He has had his full revenge And in such a generous noble mannerI am ashamed of myselfHe has saved my life and damn me if I do not feel as if I could never forgive him There was an end of me and my passions What business had he to interfereHe did it too in such an extraordinary style He appears to have risked more laboured more  performed more for me than man almost ever did for his dearest and sworn friend  Mine was an act of such ridiculous phrensy that I am half ashamed to tell what it was I jumped headlong down a declivity because I knew I was a good swimmer into a lake but like a blockhead never perceived that I should get stunned by the shelving of the rock and consequently drowned And for what truly Why to prove to a vapouring crackbrained French Count that he was a coward because perhaps he had not learned to swim When I look back I have absolutely no patience with myself  And then this generous Frank HenleyAfter a still more seemingly desperate leap than mine and bringing me  out of the water dead as a door nail two hours did he incessantly labour to restore me to life I who a few hours before had struck him And here do I live to relate all this  I think I could have forgiven him any thing sooner than this triumph over me Yet he claims and forces my admiration I must own he is a dauntless fellowYes he has a heart Damn him I could kiss him one minute and kill him the next  He has been the hero of the women ever since But they are safe enough for him He has principles He is a man of virtue forsooth He is not the naughty cat that steals the cream Let him be virtuous Let him lave in his own imaginary waters of purity but do  not let him offend others every moment by jumping out and calling"Here Look at me How white and spotless I am"  As I tell you the women are bewitched to him are all in love with him My sister Louisa does not scruple to tell him so in her letter But she is one of these highflyers Nor can I for the soul of me persuade myself that family pride excepted sheay she herself my she would not prefer him to me But these gentry are all so intolerably prudent that talk to them of passions and they answer they must not have any Oh no They are above such mundane weakness  As for him he sits in as much stern state as the Old Red Lion of Brentford  Yes he is my Lord Chief Justice Nevergrin He cannot qualify he He is prime tinker to Madam Virtue and carries no softening epithets in his budget Folly is folly and vice vice in his Good Friday vocabularyTitles too are gilt gingerbread dutch dolls punch's puppet show A duke or a scavenger with him are exactly the sameSaving and excepting the aforesaid exceptions of wisdom virtue and the good of the whole  Did you never observe Fairfax how these fellows of obscure birth labour to pull down rank and reduce all to their own level  Not but it is cursed provoking to be obliged to own that a title is no sufficient passport for so much as common sense  I sincerely think there is not so foolish a fellow in the three kingdoms as the noble blockhead to whom I have the honour to be related Lord Evelyn and while I have tickled my fancy with the recollection of my own high descent curse me if I have not blushed to acknowledge him who is the head and representative of the race as my kinsman I own however he has been of some service to me in the present affair for by his medium I have been introduced to the uncle of my deity Lord FitzAllen who has considerable influence in the family and the very essence of whose character is pride He is proud of himself proud of his family proud of his titles proud of his gout proud of his cat proud of whatever can be called  his  by  which appellation in his opinion his very coachhorses are dignified I happen to please him not by any qualities of mind or person of which he is tolerably insensible but because there is a possibility that I may one day be a peer of the realm if my booby relations will but be so indulgent as to die fast enough  Once more to these catechumenical inspectors of morality these selfappointed overseers of the conscioence  I do not deny that there is some nay much truth in the doctrines they preach to me But I hate preaching I have not time to be wisdom crammed What concern is it of mine What have I to do with the world be it wrong or right wise or foolish Let it laugh or cry kiss or curse as it pleases Like the Irishman  in the sinking ship "'Tis nothing to me I am but a passenger"  But notwithstanding these airs I have my lesson set me Ay and I must con it too must say it off by rote no parrot better  There is no resisting one's destiny and to be her slave is preferable to reigning over worlds You have for you can have no conception of her and her omnipotence She is so unlike every other woman on earth I wonder while I hear her am attentive nay am convinced What is most strange though the divinest creature that ever the hand of Heaven fashioned the moment she begins to speak you forget that she is beautiful  But she should not hesitate when I offer NoShe should beware of that At least to any other woman the world contains it would have been dangerous and I am not sure that even she is safe  However I must learn to parse my lesson for the present and be quiet Yes yes she shall find me very complaisant I must be so for live without her I cannot She must she shall be mine It is a prize which I am born to bear away from all competitors This is what flatters and consoles me  You Fairfax think yourself more in luck You continue to range at large You scorn to wear the chain today which you cannot shake off laughingly tomorrowWell I envy you notWhen  you see her if you do not envy me may I be impaled and left to roast in the sun a banquet for the crows  Good night  C CLIFTON  LETTER LV  FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD  Paris Hotel de l'Université  SOME events have happened since I wrote to thee on which I meant to have been silent till we had met but I want thy advice on a new incident and must therefore briefly relate what has passed I have had an opportunity of appeasing that hungry vanity which is  continually craving after unwholesome food I have proved to Clifton that it was not fear whichmade me submit to obloquy which in his opinion could only be washed away in blood I have been instrumental in saving his life  There is a half lunatic count who was a visitor at the Chateau and who is enamoured of her whom all are obliged to love and admire I know not whether it be their climate their food their wine or these several causes combining and strengthened by habit or whether it be habit and education only which give the natives of the south of France so much apparently constitutional ardour but such the fact appears to be This count is one of the most extravagant of all the hotbrained race I have  mentioned He indulges and feeds his flighty fancy by reading books of chivalry and admiring the most romantic of the imaginary feats of knighterrantry  The too haughty Clifton angry that he should dare to address her to whom he openly paid his court fell into habitual contests with him daring him to shew who could be most desperate and at last gave a tolerably strong proof that though he has an infinitely more consistent mind he can be at moments more mad than the count himself He leaped down a rock into a lake where it is probable he must have perished but for me  One would have imagined that what followed would have cooled even a Marseillian fever of such phrensy But no  the count has been brooding over the recollection till he had persuaded himself he was a dishonoured man and must find some means to do away the disgrace I thought him gone to Fontainebleau but instead of that he has just been here He came and inquired of the servants for the monsieur who had taken the famous leap cursing all English names as too barbarous to be understood by a delicate Provençal ear and wholly incapable of being remembered The servants thinking he meant me for I was obliged to leap too introduced him to my apartment  Luckily Clifton was out for the day She and Sir Arthur were with him I am hourly put to the trial Oliver  of seeing him preferredButPshaw  After a torrent of crazy compliments from the count who professes to admire me I learned at last it was Clifton and not me he wanted and I also learned in part what was the purport of his errand His mind was too full not to overflow Knowing how hot unruly and on such subjects irrational the spirits were that were in danger of encountering I was immediately alarmed The most effectual expedient I could conceive to prevent mischief was to shew its actual absurdity I saw no better way than that of making it appear as it really was its tragical consequences excepted ludicrous But the difficulty was to give it  the colouring which should produce that effect on a mind so distorted  Mort de ma vie  said the count I shall never pardon myself for having lost so fine an opportunity I am not so heavy as he I should not have been hurt by the fall I should have saved the life of my rival and been admired by the whole world My triumph would have been complete Every gazette in Europe would have trumpeted the exploit and the family of Beaunoir would have been rendered famous by me to all eternity No I never shall forgive myself  I think sir you ought rather to be angry with me than with Mr Clifton  Parbleu  I have been thinking of that Why did you prevent me The thought  could not long have escaped me if you had not been in such devilish haste  True The only danger was that while you were waiting for the thought the gentleman might have been drowned  Diable m'emporte  I had forgotten that Well then I must have satisfaction of Monsieur CalifMorbleuWhat is the gentleman's name  I wish I could confide enough in my French to write the dialogue in the language in which it passed but I must not attempt it The ideas however are tolerably strong in my memory and they must suffice  Clifton  Oui da  CaliftonMonsieur Califton must give me satisfaction for the  sanglante  affront I have received  But I cannot conceive sir how any man's thinking proper to kill himself can be an affront to another  Comment Monsieur Peste  But it is if he kill himself to prove me a coward  Then sir I am afraid there is not a madman in Bedlam who does not daily affront the whole world  How so sir  By doing something which no man in his senses dare imitate  Nom d'un Dieu Monsieur  I am a man of honour The family of Beaunoir is renowned for its noble feats it shall not be disgraced by me I have been defied and I will have satisfaction  But you were not defied to sword or pistol You were defied to leap  Well sir  And before as a man of honour you can have any right to give a second challenge you must answer the first  Is that your opinion sir  Nay I appeal to yourself  Allons  If so I must leap Will you do me the favour to accompany me I will order posthorses instantly You shall be my witness that I perform the first condition  Can you swim  Ventrebleu  What a question I am not heavy enough to sink Besides sir I was born at MarseillesYes we will go together you shall see me make the leap after which I may then return and publish my defiance to the whole universe  No sir If you leap you will never publish your defiance  How so  You will be killed The whole universe could not save you  Comment diable  Look at me Look at Monsieur Calif I am as light as  Peste  Yes but you are not so strong as he you cannot leap so far His effort was prodigious I have examined the place and had he fallen half a foot short of where he did he must have been dashed to pieces  Fer et feu  In that case I must dieYes I must die There is no remedy I must not dishonour my family No man on earth must brave the Count de Beaunoir I must die  And be laughed at  Laugh sir  Mort de ma vie  Who will dare to laugh  When you are dead of what should they be afraid  Morbleu  That's true  He would be a rash fool who should dare to laugh at you while you are living  Foi d'un honnête homme monsieur  you are a man of honour a gentleman You are brave yourself and know how to honour brave men and I esteem you  Sir if you really esteem me  Ventrebleu  Sir I esteem you more than any man on earth Command my purse my sword I would serve you at the hazard of my life  Then let me prevail on you sir to  consider well what I say I solemnly assure you I would not advise you to any thing which I would not do myself  Pardieu Monsieur  I am sure you would not You have too much honour  I have too much regard to truth  C'est la même chose  That is the same thing  Men honour themselves most by opposing nay by acting in the very teeth of the prejudices of mankind and he is the bravest man who opposes them the oftenest The world makes laws and afterward laughs at or despises those by whom they are obeyed He proves the nobleness of his nature best who acts with most wisdom Recollect the madness  with which Mr Clifton acted how much he was blamed by every body and imagine to yourself the temper of your own countrymen then ask whether you would not be laughed at instead of applauded and admired were you so madly to throw away a life which you ought to dedicate to your country The Parisians would write epigrams and songs and sing them in every street on the nobleman who instead of living to fight the battles of his country should toss himself like a lunatic down a rock and dash out his brains  Que Dieu me damne monsieur  but you are in the right Yes I am a soldier My country claims my sword I hear we are soon to have a war with England and then  Gardezvous bien Messieurs  les Anglois  Englishmen beware  Where is Monsieur Calif  Mr Clifton will not be at home today  Well sir be so kind as to present my compliments to him and tell him I would certainly have run him through the body if you had not done me the honour to say all that you have said to me I have appointed to set off for Fontainebleau tomorrow morning but I intend to visit England we may have the good fortune hereafter to meet and then we will come to an explanation  After a thousand whimsical half crazy but well meaning and I believe very sincere compliments and offers of  service he left me and I hope the danger is over  But as I told thee Oliver the chief purpose of my writing is to ask thy advice Principle as thou well knowest is too severe to admit of falsehood direct or indirect To mention this dialogue to Clifton might be dangerous It ought not to be I grant but still it might One would imagine that instead of feeling anger he must laugh were he told of what has passed but there is no certainty And is not silence indirect falsehood The count has been here his errand was to Clifton Ought he not to be told of it and suffered to judge for himself And is not concealment an indirect falsehood To me it appears the contrary He is full  as likely to take the wrong as the right side of the question I see a possibility of harm but no injury that can be done by silence Nor do I myself perceive how it can be classed among untruths Still the doubt has occurred to my mind and I have not hitherto answered it to my own satisfaction  I forgot to tell thee with what ardour the count declared himself an admirer of her who is most admirable and the romantic but very serious effervescence with which he called himself her champion one who had devoted himself to maintain her superiority over her whole sex which he would die affirming and to revenge her wrongs if ever mortal should be daring or guilty enough to do her injustice But as I tell thee he  is an eccentric and undefinable character  I have lately received a letter from my father from which I find he has been led by I know not what mistake to conclude that Sir Arthur thinks of me for his soninlaw His letter as usual is a strange one and such as I believe no man on earth but himself could write  Direct thy next to me in Grosvenor Street for we shall be on our return before I shall receive an answer  Farewell  F HENLEY  LETTER LVI  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London Grosvenor Street  WHAT strange perversity of accidents is it Louisa that has made me most deeply indebted to that man above all others on the face of the earth who thinks I have treated him unjustly We are under fresh obligations nay in  all probability we again owe our lives to Frank Henley  We left Paris on Sunday last and after waiting a day and a night for a fair wind at Calais we embarked on board the packetboat the wind still continuing unfavourable though it had changed a little for the better The channel was very rough and the water ran high when we went on board Sir Arthur would willingly have retreated but Clifton was too impatient and prevailed on him to venture  Before we had reached the middle of the channel Laura Sir Arthur and soon afterward I were very seasick It is a most disagreeable sensation when violent and would certainly be more effectual  in rendering a coward fearless of death than the dying sentiments of Seneca or Socrates himself  The wind increased and the captain laboured several hours but in vain to make the port of Dover He at last told us we were too late for the tide and that the current set against us and must drive us down to Deal We proceeded accordingly and it was dark before we came within sight of the town of Deal where the captain in the sea phrase was obliged to come to an anchor  The Deal boatmen who are always on the watch and are the most noted as we are told on the whole coast for their extortion soon came up to the ship inviting us to be put on shore but refusing to take us for less than ten guineas  Frank and Sir Arthur were desirous that we should not be imposed upon but Clifton pleaded my sea sickness and would not listen to any proposal of delay He is very peremptory when his passions are excited and especially when he conceives as he then did that reason is on his side There were three boats but they had agreed among themselves and two of them kept aloof This we are told is their common practice that they may not spoil their market by competitorship  We were not above a mile from shore Clifton however agreed to their extravagant demand and we went into the boat  We had not been there many minutes before we perceived that the five boatmen  who managed it were all in liquor especially he who seemed to be their head man and that we were much more at the mercy of winds and waves in our present than in our former situation Clifton and Frank endeavoured to make them attentive by reproving them and probably did some good though the answers they received in the rugged vulgar idiom of the sea were not very conciliatory We were much tossed by the roughness of the water but made however toward the shore though evidently in an awkward and dangerous way  Most part of the beach at Deal is excessively steep and when the weather is stormy the waves break against it very abruptly and dangerously to boats which  are managed by men that are either ignorant or have drunken away their senses When the boat approached the beach the man at the helm being stupid and it being dark did not do his duty and the side of the boat was dashed against the beach The shock almost overset the boat and it was half filled by the wave which broke over it The water is always a fickle and perilous element but in an agitated sea when the winds howl and the waves roar foam dash retreat and return with additional threats and raging it is then truly terrific I shall never forget that night I think on it even now with horror One of those poor drunken creatures Louisa was in an instant washed overboard and lost almost without a cry not  heard not aided scarcely remarked no attempt made to save him for all attempt was absolutely impossible we were within a few yards of land yet were ourselves almost certain of perishing The remaining men were little better than helpless for it was the most active of them who was thus miserably drownedIndeed Louisa it was dreadful  The reflux of the water was in half a minute likely to be equally violent Frank whose presence of mind never forsakes him saw what the nature of our danger was and shaking off poor Laura who clung round him begging of him for God's sake to save her precious life he flew to the helm turned the  head of the boat in its proper direction and called with that imperious kind of voice which on such occasions enforces obedience for somebody to come to the helm Clifton was there in an instant Keep it said Frank in this position  Every motion was necessarily rapid Frank was immediately out of the boat and almost up to the shoulders in the sea He caught hold of the side of the boat retreated a step or two set his feet against the steep beach and steadied it to resist the returning wave It had no sooner retreated than he called to me took me in his arms and in a moment I found myself in safety on shore  He returned and brought my father next  Poor Laura shrieked with fear and impatience She was the third whom he landed  He then ordered the boatmen to take care of themselves and drunk and refractory though they were they did not neglect to obey the mandate After which Clifton leaving the helm jumped into the water the servants having gone before and we all found ourselves safe after some of us had concluded we were lost beyond redemption  Our peril appears to have been wholly owing to the inebriety of the boatmen for had they been able to do their duty there would have been none or certainly very little and it was averted by the active and penetrating mind of Frank which seems as if it were most accurate  and determined in its conclusions and expedients in proportion to the greatness of the danger when common minds would be wholly confused and impotent  Clifton though he did not so immediately perceive what was best to be done saw the propriety of it when doing and immediately assented and aided by keeping the boat in the position Frank directed almost as essentially as his coadjutor I am more and more convinced it is accident only that has kept him from possessing one of the most enlarged of human understandings But I must likewise allow that this said accident has rendered him petulant impatient of contradiction too precipitate to be always aware of mistake and too positive to be easily governed But these are  habitual errors which time and care will cure  I must add too that his affection for me displays itself in a thousand various forms He is apparently never satisfied except when it is exercised to give or procure me pleasure I know not whether the passion which infuses itself into all his words and actions that relate to me ought to inspire all that sympathetic sensibility which he intends but I own it sometimes alarms me His ardour is astonishing He seems to wish and even to design to make it irresistible Yet it is mingled with such excess of tenderness that I have half lost the power of repressing it  But I must not no I will not stand in awe of his impetuosity Ardour is a  noble quality and my study shall be how to turn it to his advantage The more I look round me the more I perceive that fear enfeebles withers and consumes the powers of mind Those who would nobly do must nobly dare Rash people perhaps are those who feel the truth of this principle so strongly that they forget it is necessary not only to dare but to discover the best method of daring  Clifton now avoids argument and appears systematically determined to be of my opinion or rather to say as I say The only opposition he affords is now and then a witty sarcastic or humorous reply But he is generally successful in his continual attempts to give the conversation a new turn when his favourite opinions are opposed for I do not think  it wise to obtrude too many painful contradictions upon him at a time Truth must be progressive Like a flash of lightning it stuns or kills by excess  Clifton will not long suffer me to rest now we are returned and consequently my dear Louisa may soon expect another letter from her most affectionate  A W ST IVES  LETTER LVII  FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD  London Grosvenor Street  WE have now been in London four days Oliver and known places reviving old ideas it almost seems as if we had never moved from the spot where we are at present I fall into the same trains of thinking except that I am more restless more inclined to melancholy  to inaction to a kind of inanity which no trifling efforts can shake off  I have received thy letter and find thy reasoning in some respects similar to my own I was ashamed of remaining in doubt on a question which only required a little extraordinary activity of mind to resolve It appears to me that nothing can be classed among falsehoods except those things the tendency of which is to generate falsehood or mistake Consequently not to tell what has passed to Clifton is acting according to the dictates of truth for to tell would be to run an imminent danger of false conclusions Not it is true if the whole could be told that is if all possible reasonings and consequences could be fairly recollected and stated But  memory is first to be feared and still more that prejudice which will not have the patience to lend mute attention I therefore think with thee that silence in this case is truth  We have been in some danger owing to the drunkenness of the Deal boatmen but saved ourselves by a little exertion One of the poor inebriated wretches however was lost We saw him only the instant of his being washed overboard and he was hurried away into the sea by the recoiling waves in the roaring of which his last cry was overpowered without our being able so much as to attempt to give him aid By which thou mayest judge that we ourselves were in considerable jeopardy  When we reflect how near danger is  to us daily and hourly through life we are apt to wonder that we so continually escape But when we again consider how easily even great dangers that is such as take us by surprise may be warded off the wonder ceases  My mind Oliver is not at ease it is too much haunted by fear At least I hope it is for my fears are for one whom it is almost torture to suppose in peril Thou never knewest so enterprising so encroaching a youth as this Clifton Nay I am deceived if encroachment be not reduced to system with him and strong as her powers are impossible as I know it to be to shake her principles yet who can say what may happen in a moment of forgetfulness or mistake  to a heart so pure so void of guile  Such terrors are ridiculous perhaps thou wilt say and perhaps they are at least I most devoutly hope they are But his temperament is sanguine his wishes restless ungovernable and I almost fear ominous and his passion for her is already far beyond the controul of reason to which indeed he thinks it ought not to be nor can be subject  As for me all is ended Jealous I must not no I will not be And surely I am above the meanness of envy Yet I own Oliver I sometimes blame her I think her too precipitate too fearless nay too ready to imagine her power her wondrous power greater than it is  She makes no secret of her thoughts and she tells me that she and I she doubts not shall transform him to all that we ourselves could desire Be not surprised at her kindness to me for she has a heart that is all benevolence all friendship all affection If I can aid her thou needest not doubt my will But Heaven grant she may not be mistakenHeaven grant it  And yet I cannot say I even sometimes hope and acquiesce for his talents are indeed extraordinary But his pride and the pitiless revenge which he shews a constant propensity to take when offended are dangerous symptoms  For her she seems to act from motives wholly different from those of her age  and sex It is not passion not love such as it is usually felt and expressed it is a sense of duty friendship for Louisa admiration of great talents an ardent desire to give those talents their full value and the dignified pride she takes in restoring such a mind to its proper rank By these she is actuated as all her words and actions demonstrate  Well well Oliver She soars a flight that is more than mortal But she leaves a luminous track that guides and invites and I will attempt to follow Thou shalt see me rise above the poor slavish wishes that would chain me to earth  Oliver my mind like a bow continually bent is too much upon the stretch Such is the effect of my situation of  which my thoughts my language and my actions partake But I will calm this agitation Fear not thou shalt find me worthy to be thy friend and the pupil of thy most excellent father  No I will not Oliver be a child though the contest be indeed severe By day I am with her for hours I listen while she sings or plays or speaks I am a witness of her actions Her form is never absent from me The sound of her voice is unceasing harmony to my ears At night retiring to darkness and thought I pass her chamber door In the morning again I behold the place where all that is heavenly rests I endeavour after apathy I labour to be senseless stupid an idiot I  strain to be dead to supreme excellence But it is the stone of Sisyphus and I am condemned to eter  Indeed Oliver this weakness is momentary Indeed it isFear not thou shalt find me a man be assured thou shalt Though the furies or worse than all that invention can feign the passions throng to assault me I will neither fly nor yield For to do either would be to desert myself my principles my duties  Yet this encroaching spirit that I told thee ofBut then what is the strength of him compared to hers What is there to fear What do I fear Why  create horrible shadows purposely to encounter themNo it cannot be  Farewell  F HENLEY  LETTER LVIII  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London Grosvenor Street  YOUR brother has gained his point The deed is done My consent is given For in reality to have withheld it would have had more the appearance of a coquette than of the friend of my Louisa After sufficiently strong hints in the course of the two first days  on the third after our arrival Clifton came His intention was evidently to take no denial It was with difficulty that I could bring him to listen for a few minutes while I repeated principles before declared and required an avowal of how far he thought them an impediment to future happiness To every thing I could ask he was ready to accede  He had nothing to contend nothing to contradict and if he did not think exactly like me in every particular he was determined not to think at all till he could Beside my own conclusions in favour of truth were my safeguard I had not any doubt that reason if attended to must finally prevail and I could not deny that he was at all times ready to pay the strictest attention  Indeed he seemed at first resolved as it were not to enter into any conversation but to claim my promise But I was still more determined to exert myself that the due influence which reason ought always to have over passion might not be lost and sink into habitual and timid concession When he perceived there was no resisting he then listened with a tolerably good grace but still as I said with an apparently preconcerted plan not to contend urging and indeed truly that fair arguments could desire nothing more than patient hearing and this he pledged in his energetic and half wild manner honour body and soul to give I could not desire more sincere asseverations than he made and that they were sincere I cannot doubt Nor do I regret that they  were strong Where there is energy there is the material of which mind is fashioned and the fault must be mine if the work be incomplete Our conversation however was long and when at last obliged to enter into the subject the acuteness and depth of his remarks were strong proof of his powers had any proof been wantingYes Louisa the attempt must be made It is a high and indispensable duty and I must neither be deterred by the dread of danger nor swayed by the too seducing emotions of the heartThey must be silencedThey must  I have an assistant worthy of the cause Frank does not shrink from the task though it is but too evident that he has not changed his opinion I know not why but so it is those two particular  sentences continually reverberate in my ear  I feel a certainty of conviction that you act from mistaken principlesTo the end of time I shall persist in thinking you mine by right  Oh Louisa  Sir Arthur of course made no difficulty in giving his consent and I imagine Mrs Clifton will this post receive a letter from her son and perhaps another from my father requiring her acquiescence  Sir Arthur has shewn me one of the most strange eccentric and perhaps comic letters from  honest Aby  that I think I ever read I am glad it is not quite so intelligible to Sir Arthur as it is to me for I see no good that could result were he to understand its true sense The old I can find no epithet for him that pleases meWell then  Honest  Aby  is excessively anxious that I should marry a son of whom he is so unworthy But his motives are so mean so whimsical and so oddly compounded and described peering as it were through the mask of cunning with which he awkwardly endeavours to conceal them that nothing but reading his letter can give you an idea of its characteristic humour This post I suppose will likewise shew him his mistake How he will receive the news I know not though I suspect he will raise obstacles concerning the money which Sir Arthur wants in order to pay my portion But this will soon be seen  I likewise learn from his letter that my brother is to join in docking the entail of the hereditary estate and that he is willing provided he may share the  spoil How would my heart bleed were I not cured of that prejudice which makes happiness consist in the personal possession of wealth But the system of tyranny would be more firm and durable even than it is did not this mutation of property daily exist and were not the old and honourable families as they call themselves brought to ruin by their foolish and truly dishonourable descendants  Every thing confirms me in the suspicion that honest Aby has been playing a deep game and that both Sir Arthur and my brother have ceded to all the extortions of craft and usury to have their whims and extravagancies supplied  My brother persuades himself that he is determined never to marry and I suppose has formed this determination  purposely that he may spend all he can obtain without being teased by any qualms of conscience For the destructive system of individual property involves a thousand absurdities and the proud but inane successor of a Sydney or a Verulam instead of knowing how difficult the subject of identity itself is instead of perceiving that man is nothing but a continuity or succession of single thoughts and is therefore in reality no more than the thought of the moment believes there is a stable and indubitable affinity between him and his great ancestor  I must now be more than ever determined to accomplish the task I have undertaken and to give to the arms of my best my dearest Louisa a brother worthy of a heart so pure and a sister  such as she herself could wish to be that brother's other halfVery true Louisa It is the old story I am Sir Arthur's vapouring hussey But I comfort myself with reflecting that after the battle is won the rashness of the attack is never remembered or if it be it is always applauded and that all generals great or small confide in their own plans till defeat has proved them to be abortive Something must be ventured ere any thing can be won  Not knowing what might be the notions of Sir Arthur or even of Mrs Clifton concerning the silence they might think it necessary to keep I forbore to mention their plan of which my friend with her consistent frankness informed me till our last conference but I then thought it an indispensable duty  to relate the truth otherwise it might have come at some unlucky moment in the disguise of falsehood and have done mischief Secrets are indeed absolutely contrary to my system 'Tis pride or false shame that puts blinds to the windows either of the house or of the mind Let the whole world look in and see what is doing that if any thing be wrong it may have an opportunity to reprove and whatever is right there is some hope it may imitate Clifton was pleased to find himself treated with undisguised sincerity Yes Louisa fear not you will find him your brother in virtue as well as in blood  Ever and ever most affectionately A W ST IVES  LETTER LIX  SIR ARTHUR ST IVES TO THE HONOURABLE MRS CLIFTON  London Grosvenor Street  DEAR MADAM  OUR plan has succeeded to our wish Mr Clifton is as I may say quite smitten with my daughter And indeed I do not wonder at it for though she is my child I must say she is the sweetest most charming lovely girl I  ever beheld She has always been my darling I have a true fatherly fondness for her and though I own it will not be very convenient to me I mean immediately to raise twenty thousand pounds to pay down as her portion If at my death I should have the power to do more she shall not be forgotten but I promise nothing  As I remember dear madam this was the sum which you said was necessary to redeem certain mortgages pay off encumbrances and enable Mr Clifton to appear in England in a manner becoming the heir of the Clifton family And this sum I think it very fit the daughter of Sir Arthur St Ives should receive I shall accordingly write to my agent and put every thing immediately  in train after which you shall hear from me without delay  If any alteration should have happened in your own views or affairs which may impede or forward our plan you will be kind enough to inform me  I am madam with the truest respect your very obedient humble servant A ST IVES  LETTER LX  COKE CLIFTON TO THE HONOURABLE MRS CLIFTON  London Dover Street  I WRITE to you dear and honoured madam with a grateful and happy heart to thank you for a project so maternally and wisely conceived in my favour and of which I have just been informed by the frankhearted and lovely Anna St Ives Of all the blessings for which  madam I hold myself indebted to you this last of discovering and endeavouring to secure for your thankful son a gem so precious a lady so above all praise I esteem to be the greatest  You dear madam are acquainted with the propriety with which she thinks and acts on every occasion and I have no doubt will join with me in applauding the entire undisguisedness of relating all that had passed which appeared to her delicate mind at this moment to be absolutely necessary  After obtaining her consent for that purpose I have spoken to Sir Arthur who at my request has promised immediately to write to you And it being a project dear madam a kind one of your own forming I have no fear that it should  be discountenanced by you My only doubt is of delay Let me entreat you my dear mother to remove all impediments with every possible speed and not to lose a moment in writing to me as soon as you and Sir Arthur have arranged the business that I may solicit her from whom I am certain to receive all possible bliss to name a time when suspense shall joyfully end  Do not dear madam let impatience seem a fault in me Remember the lady who she is and all she is and think if her perfections could make the impression which they seem to have done upon your heart what must they have made upon mine I who with all the fire of youth and constitutional eagerness in  consequence of your own wise plan am become a wishing and expecting lover  My sister I am sure is too generous the happiness of her friend and brother being pledged not to join me in the request I now make and I certainly will not forget a kindness which I acknowledge I know not how I shall ever repay  I am dear madam your ever affectionate and dutiful son  C CLIFTON  END OF VOLUME III
