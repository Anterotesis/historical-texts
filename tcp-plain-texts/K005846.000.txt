 NEWMARKET A SATIRE  ΠΟΥΛΥΠΟΝΟΣ ΙΠΠΕΙΑ  ΩΣ ΕΜΟΛΕΣ ΑΙΑΝΗ  ΤΑΔΕ ΓΑ  Σοφοκ Ελ  LONDON Printed for J NEWBERY at the  Bible  and  Sun  in St  Paul  's ChurchYard MDCCLI  NEWMARKET A SATIRE  HIS Country's hope when now the blooming Heir  Has left the parent's or the guardian's care  Fond to possess yet eager to destroy  Of each vain youth say what's the darling joy  Of each fond frolic what the source and end  His sole and first ambition whatto spend  Some 'Squires to  Gallia  's cooks most dainty dupes  Melt manors in ragouts or drown in soups  This coxcomb doats on fiddlers till he sees  His mortgag'd mountains destitute of trees  Convinc'd too late that modern strains can move  With mightier force than those of  Greece  the grove  In headless statues rich and useless urns  MARMOREO from the classic tour returns  So poor the wretch of current coin you'd laugh  He cares notif his  Antique Medals  CAESARS be but safe  Some tread the slippery paths of love's delights  These deal the cards or shake the box at WHITE's  To different pleasures different tastes incline  Nor the same  sea  receives the rushing  swine  Tho' drunk alike with CIRCE's poisonous bowl  In seperate sties the mimic monsters roll  But would ye learn ye leisureloving 'Squires  How best ye may disgrace your prudent sires  How soonest soar to fashionable shame  Be damn'd at once to ruinand to fame  By hands of Grooms ambitious to be crown'd  O greatly dare to tread  Olympic  ground  Where fam'd NEWMARKET spreads her tempting plain  There let the chosen steed victorious strain  Where not  Alluding to those wellknown lines of Sir JOHN DENHAM in  Cooper's Hill  on  London  "Thro' several ways they run  "Some to undo and some to be undone"  as erst was sung in manly lays  Men fly to different ends thro' different ways  Thro' the same path to the same goal ye run  And are at once undoing and undone  Forfeit forget friends honour and estate  Lose all at oncefor whatto win the plate  All are betray'd and all alike betray  To your own beasts ACTAEONlike a prey  What dreams of conquest flush'd HILARIO's breast  When the good Knight at last retir'd to rest  Behold the youth with newfelt rapture mark  Each pleasing prospect of the spacious Park  That Park where beauties undisguis'd engage  Those beauties less the work of art than age  In simple state where genuine Nature wears  Her venerable dress of ancient years  Where all the charms of chance with order meet  The rude the gay the graceful and the great  Here aged oaks uprear their branches hoar  And form dark groves which  Druids  might adore  Pride and support of  Britain  's conquering cross  Which distant ancestors saw crown'd with moss  With meeting boughs and deepening to the view  Here shoots the broad umbrageous avenue  Here various trees compose a chequer'd scene  Glowing in gay diversities of Green  There the full stream thro' intermingling glades  Shines a broad lake or falls in deep cascades  Nor wants there hazle copse or beechen lawn  To chear with sun or shade the bounding fawn  And see the good old seat whose  Gothic  tow'rs  Awful emerge from yonder tufted bow'rs  Whose rafter'd hall the crowding tenants fed  And dealt to Age and Want their daily bread  Where garter'd knights with peerless beauties joyn'd  At high and solemn festivals have din'd  Presenting oft fair virtue's shining task  In mystic pageantries and moral  It was a fashionable Practice among our ancient nobility and gentry of both sexes to perform personally in entertainments of this kind Nothing could be a more delightful or rational method of spending an evening than this MILTON's  Comus  was thus exhibited at  LudlowCastle  in the Year  See  BEN JOHNSON's  Masques  Poetry painting and musick were here united in their highest perfection It were to be wished that our modern people of distinction would revive this excellent practice and substitute it in the place of  routes  and  masquerades  But in the present age the idea of the true  decorum  seems to be utterly extinct and even the dignity of human nature seems to be quite overrun with the false refinements of affected elegance and all the inconsistent fopperies of studied folly  Masque  But vain all ancient praise or boast of birth  Vain all the palms of old heroic worth  At once a bankrupt and a prosperous Heir  HILARIO betsPark House dissolve in air  With antique armour hung his trophied rooms  Descend to Gamesters Prostitutes and Grooms  He sees his steelclad Sires and Mothers mild  Who bravely shook the lance or sweetly smil'd  All the fair series of the whisker'd race  Whose pictur'd forms the stately gallery grace  Debas'd abus'd the price of illgot gold  To deck some tavern vile at auctions sold  The parish wonders at th' unopening door  The chimnies blaze the tables groan no more  Thick weeds around th' untrodden courts arise  And all the social scene in silence lies  Himself the loss politely to repair  Turns Atheist Fiddler Highwayman or Play'r  At length the scorn the shame of Man and God  Is doom'd to  rub  the steeds that once he  rode  Ye rival Youths your golden hopes how vain  Your dreams of thousands on the listed plain  Not more fantastic  Clavileno  See  Don Quixote  B ii Chap  SANCHO's airy course  When madly mounted on the magic horse  He pierc'd heavn's opening spheres with dazzled eyes  And seem'd to soar in visionary skies  Nor less I ween precarious is the meed  Of young advent'rers on the Muse's steed  For Poets have like you their destin'd round  And Ours is but a race on classic ground  Long time soft son of patrimonial ease  HIPPOLITUS had ate sirloins in peace  Had quaff'd secure unvex'd by toils or wife  The mild  October  of a rural life  Long liv'd with calm domestic conquests crown'd  And kill'd his game on safe paternal ground  As bland he puff'd the pipe o'er weekly news  His bosom kindles with sublimer views  Lo there thy triumphs Tthy palms P  Tempt him to rein the steed and stake his store  Like a new bruiser on BROUGHTONIC sand  Amid the lists our hero takes his stand  Suck'd by the Sharper to the Peer a prey  He rolls his eyes that witness huge dismay  When lo the chance of one unlucky heat  Strips him of game strong beer and sweet retreat  How awkward now he bears disgrace and dirt  Nor knows the  Poor's  last refuge to be  pert  The shiftless beggar bears of ills the worst  At once with dulness and with hunger curst  And feels the tasteless breast  equestrian  fires  And dwells such mighty rage in graver  'squires  In all attempts but for their country bold  Britain  thy CONSCRIPT COUNSELLORS behold  For some perhaps by fortune favour'd yet  May gain a burrough by a lucky bet  Smit with the love of the  laconic  boot  The cap and wig succinct the silken suit  Mere modern PHAETON's usurp the reins  And scour in rival race NEWMARKET's plains  See side by side the Jockey and Sir JOHN  Discuss th' important pointof  six to one  For oh my Muse the deepfelt bliss how dear  How great the pride to gain a Jockey's ear  See like a routed host with headlong pace  Thy  Members  pour amid the mingling race  All ask what crouds the tumult could produce  "Is  Bedlam  or the  Cns  all broke loose"  Such noise and nonsense betting damning sinking  Such emphasis of oaths and claretdrinking  Like schoolboys freed they run as chance directs  Proud from a  wellbred thing  to risque their necks  The warrior's scar not half so graceful seems  As at NEWMARKET dislocated limbs  Thy  sages  hear amid th' admiring croud  Adjudge the  stakes  most eloquently loud  With critic skill o'er dubious  bets  preside  The low dispute or kindle or decide  All empty wisdom and judicious prate  Of  distanc'd  horses gravely fix the fate  Guide the nice conduct of a daring  match  And o'er th'  equestrian  rights with care paternal watch  Meantime no more the mimic patriots rise  To guard  Britannia  's honour warm and wise  No more in Senates dare assert her laws  Nor pour the bold debate in freedom's cause  Neglect the counsels of a sinking land  And know no  Rostrum  but  NewMarket's  A kind of scaffold where is held a  consistory  made up of several very eminent gentlemen for determining doubtful cases in the race  c  This place might not improperly be called a  Pandaemonium  Stand  Are these the sage directive pow'rs design'd  With the nice search of a sagacious mind  In judgment's scales the fate of realms to weigh  Britannia  's interest trade and laws survey  O say when least their sapient schemes are crost  Or when a nation or a  match  is lost  Who  dams  and  sires  with more exactness trace  Than of their country's Kings the sacred race  Think  London journies  are the worst of ills  And set their hands to  articles  for

senators  Meet all at  Westminster  in boots and spurs  See the whole House with mutual frenzy mad  Her Patriots all in leathern breeches clad  Of  bets  for  taxes  learnedly debate  And guide with equal reins a  Steed  and  State  How would a virtuous  Vid  GULLIVER's travels voyage to the  Houhnhyms  Houhnhym  neigh disdain  To see his brethren brook th' imperious rein  Bear slavery's wanton whip or galling goad  Smoak thro' the glebe or trace the destin'd road  And robb'd of manhood by the murderous knife  Sustain each sordid toil of servile life  Yet oh what rage would touch his generous mind  To see his sons of more than mortal kind  A kind with each ingenuous virtue blest  That fills the prudent head or valorous breast  Afford diversion to that monster base  That meanest spawn of man's halfmonkey race  In whom pride avarice ignorance conspire  That hated animal a  YahooSquire  How are th' advent'rers of the  British  race  Chang'd from the chosen chiefs of ancient days  Who warm'd with genuine glory's honest thirst  Divinely labour'd in the  Pythian  dust  Their's was the wreath that lifted from the throng  Their's was the  Theban  bard's recording song  Meantime to manly emulation blind  Slaves to each vulgar vice that stains the mind  Our  British  THERON's issue to the race  Of their own generous coursers the disgrace  What tho' the grooms of  Greece  ne'er  took the odds  They won no  bets  but then they soar'd to gods  And more an HIERO's Palm a PINDAR's Ode  Than all the united  plates  of GE bestow'd  Greece  how I kindle at thy magic name  Feel all thy warmth and catch the kindred flame  Thy solemn scenes and awful visions rise  In ancient grace before my musing eyes  Here  Sparta  's sons in mute attention hang  While sage LYCURGUS pours the mild harangue  There XERXES' hosts all pale with deadly fear  Shrink at her  LEONIDAS  fated Hero's flashing spear  Here hung with many a lyre of silver string  The laureat walks of sweet ILISSUS spring  And lo where rapt in beauty's heav'nly dream  Hoar PLATO walks his oliv'd  Academe  Yet ah no more the seat of art and arms  Delights with wisdom or with virtue warms  Lo the stern  Turk  with more than Gothic rage  Has blasted all the bays of ancient age  No more her groves by sacred feet are trod  Each Attic Grace has left the lov'd abode  Fall'n is fair GREECE by luxury's pleasing bane  Seduc'd she drags a barbarous foreign chain  BRITANNIA watch O trim thy withering bays  Remember thou hast rival'd GRAECIA's praise  Great Nurse of works divine yet oh beware  Lest thou the fate of GREECE my Country share  Recall thy wonted worth with conscious pride  Thou too hast seen a SOLON in a HYDE  Hast bade thine EDWARDS and thine HENRY's rear  With  Spartan  fortitude the  British  spear  Alike hast seen thy sons deserve the meed  Or of the moral or the martial Deed  FINIS
