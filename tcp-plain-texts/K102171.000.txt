 EXPLANATORY REMARKS UPON THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY WHEREIN The MORALS and POLITICS of this PIECE are clearly laid open By JEREMIAH KUNASTROKIUS M D  "By way of MOTTO"  ANONYMOUS  LONDON  Printed for E CABE in  AvemaryLane Ludgatestreet  MDCCLX  EXPLANATORY REMARKS UPON THE LIFE and OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY  CHAP I  IT is the misfortune of all  great  writers to put pen to paper so fast and let their imaginations carry them away in such a hurry that they seldom consider whether their readers comprehensions will be able to gallop after them posthaste without being out of breath to the end of the first chapter even tho' it should not contain above a  dozen lines And it is as great an error in judgment nay worse than that which  Byng  was shot for to put too much wit in any production that is intended for universal reading I say universal reading for besides the opinion of one of the greatest writers of this or the last age I cannot say which  "that a reader should have as much wit as the author he reads to understand him"  which I flatter myself is seldom the case I speak as an author and therefore should be allowed a little vanity I say besides this generally received doctrine how can we tell what different kinds of wit prevail with all the readers in the universe to go no further than the antipodes it is a thousand to one whether they would understand a  pun  or the best  bonmot  in all  Tristram Shandy  and for aught I can tell in  the moon and some other of the illiterate planets they may have exploded every kind of true wit mentioned by Addison It is evidently for this reason that in most of the periodical works which are reckoned  universal  and particularly the magazines we are very seldom troubled with any thing but plain good sense the best method of making watergruel and fattening of capons which may be of use and understood all over the world  CHAP II  MY good friend and arch companion Mr  Tristram Shandy gentlemen  who makes such honourable mention of my learned father the celebrated doctor  Kunastrokius  of physical memory  Vide pag vol I  has fallen into this very mistake that I have just been mentioning and by a certain subtility of thinking and quaintness of expression the beauties and excellencies of his work may not only be passed over by many of the inhabitants of  Asiaminor Monomotapa  some of the Mickmacs Cherokees and Catawbas but at least by seven hundred and fifty of the inhabitants of  London  and  Westminster  the  Borough of Southwark  and parts adjacent  This computation which I did not make myself may appear at first somewhat too exact but the reader may be persuaded I have it from the best authority  my printer  who assures me I cannot sell more or less than that number  I own I was at first of another opinion and therefore ordered him to print twenty thousand but he soon convinced me of my mistake by the cartloads of wastepaper in his shop so that I now set down to write for the seven hundred and fifty  incomprehensible readers  of  Tristram Shandy  in and about the purlicus of this metropolis and  no other    CHAP III  TO them be it known then that Mr  Tristram Shandy  is one of the greatest moralists and most refined politicians this or any other age whatever has produced  CHAP IV  BEFORE we enter upon the illustration of these  round assertions  it will be necessary to point out the qualifications of a moralist He should have a fundamental knowledge of  ethics  or that science which fixes the oeconomy and conduct of human Life that teaches the regulation of the passions and instructs men to be happy by practising all the social virtues He should know how to adapt these rules to the various subjects he treats of and point out such evident and uncontrovertable conclusions in favour of morality as every unbiassed reader must be sensible of the effect  CHAP V  A Moralist has generally one two three four five six and sometimes more things in view Those of the singular number write for writing's sake those of the first plural number invert the rule of oeconomy  "a penny saved is a penny got"  and think that in getting a penny they do more than save one they have not so that they make writing and eating go hand in hand The triple number have generally some new moral doctrine to broach and with the two former concommittants add that of selfopiniated public service Then come the controvertists to these and the recontrovertists with  their answers replies and rejoinders  ad infinitum  But before I launch out any further in the definition of a moral writer I must inform my  seven hundred and fifty readers  that Mr  Tristram Shandy  is not among any of these classes He stands by himself upon the top shelf of ethics tho' but  in twelves unrivalled inimitable  and to my seven hundred and fifty incomprehensible readers  incomprehensible  He must therefore be more fully explained than any of the foregoing moralists and for that reason I allow him best part of the following sheets for his public defence to  the moral world    CHAP VI  THE first evident mark of Mr  Tristram  's morals which indeed  is no farther than the third page is what he puts into his mother's mouth upon his father's  regularity  in winding up the house clock  Regularity  every one knows is the cornerstone of virtueand virtue is the foundation of morality Thus far then Mr  Shandy  goes on in a moral track to give us the history of his antibirth  But what does the winding up of the clock allude toand how comes it this thought always entered his mother's head once a month This he very naturally accounts for by an assemblage of ideas according to Locke and whatever it may want in  decency  he very notably makes up by sound philosophy and his  little men  Homunculus  singular  Homunculi  plural    in embrioaccording  to the oeconomy of human life and consistant with moral duties  CHAP VII  IT would be difficult for me and tedious for my readers to trace Mr  Tristram Shandy  through every part of his moral character I shall therefore confine myself to such traits as are the most striking tho' not selfevident and least understood  Among these the following passage seems next to claim our attention  "The rituals direct the baptizing of the child in case of danger before it is born but upon this proviso that some part or other of the child's body be seen by the baptiser but the  doctors of the Sorbonne by deliberation held amongst them April have enlarged the powers of the midwives by determining that though no part of the child's body should appear that baptism shall nevertheless be administered to it by injection by means of a little squirt 'Tis very strange that St Thomas Aquinas who had so good a mechanical head both for tying and untying the knots of schooldivinity should after so much pains bestowed upon thisgive up the point at last as a thing impossible"  Here follows the question upon baptism with the consultation of the doctors of the Sorbonne thereupon in French but as Mr  Shandy  has not favoured us with a translation and as very likely  some of my  incomprehensible  readers may not understand that language I have rendered it in EnglishThose of my readers who notwithstanding their  incomprehensibility  have a smattering of the Gallican tongue and fancy they comprehend the whole affair in the original have nothing to do but skip to chapter and fancy there is no such thing as chapter in this  whole  bookI mean  volume    CHAP VIII  A Memorial presented to the doctors of the Sorbonne  "A Surgeon and manmidwife represents to the gentlemen of the  Sorbonne  that there are some cases though very uncommon wherein a mother cannot  be delivered and when even the child is so inclosed in the mother's womb that no part of it's body appears in which case according to the rituals baptism should be conferred to it at least upon conditions The surgeon who makes this representation engages by means of a syringe to baptize immediately the child without any way hurting the mother The question he asks is whether this method he proposes is allowable and legal and if he may follow it in a case parallel to that which he represents"  The answer to the foregoing memorial  "The council is of opinion that the question proposed has many difficulties  to be first removed The theologists have on one side established a principle that baptism which is a spiritual birth supposes a prior birth we must be born into the world to be reborn in  Jesus Christ  according to their doctrine St  Thomas  part quaest article follows this opinion as an established fact we cannot says that holy doctor baptize children which are inclosed in their mothers wombs By this St Thomas means these children are not born and therefore cannot be reckoned amongst other men from whence he infers they cannot be the object of an external action to receive thereby the sacraments necessary to salvation Pueri in maternis uteris existentes nondum prodicerunt in lucem ut cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant unde  non possunt subjici actioni humanae ut per corum ministerum sacramenta recipiant ad salutem The rituals enforce the practice of what theoligists have regulated upon those heads and they unanimously prohibit the baptising of children which are inclosed in their mothers wombs if no part of their bodies appears The concurrence of the theologists and the rituals which are the rules of the diocesses seems to establish an authority necessary to answer the present quesstion however the council of conscience considering on the one hand that the reasonings of the theologists is entirely founded upon their desire of conformity and that the prohibition of the rituals supposes that children so inclosed cannot be baptized in their mothers wombs which is against the present supposition and  on the other hand considering that the same theologians teach that the Sacraments which  Jesus Christ  has established as the easy but necessary means of sanctifying man may be hazarded and besides supposing that children inclosed in their mothers wombs are capable of salvation as they are liable to damnation upon these considerations and having an eye to the memorial wherein it is assured that a certain method is found out of baptizing children thus inclosed without occasioning the least prejudice to the mother the council imagines that the means proposed may be made use of in the belief that God has not left this kind of children without any resource and supposing according to the representation that the means there proposed are porper to procure them baptism  nevertheless as by authorizing the proposed practice a rule universally established must be cancelled the council thinks that the memoralist should make application to his bishop whose province it is to judge of the utility and danger of the method proposed and as under the direction of the bishop the council thinks that recourse should be had to the pope in whom the right of explaining the laws of the church and of derogating therefrom where they cannot be executed is invested and however ingenious and useful the manner of baptism here proposed may be the council cannot give their approbation to it without the concurrence of these two authorities The memoralist is at least advised to apply to his bishop and to inform him of the present decision that in case the prelate should  coincide with the reasons whereupon the undersigned have founded their opinions he may be authorized in cases of necessity when too much time may be lost to ask permission and have it granted for following the method proposed so advantageous to the child's salvation The council has nothing further to add than that notwithstanding they believe this method may be pursued are nevertheless of opinion that in case the children in question should come into the world contrary to the expectation of those who have used this method it would be necessary to baptize them upon condition and this is conformable to all the rituals which in authorizing the baptism of a child some part of whose body appears enjoins at the same time and orders it's baptism  upon condition  in case it comes happily into the world"  Deliberated in the Sorbonne  the th of April  A LE MOYNE L DE ROMIGNY DE MARCILLY  CHAP IX  I Suppose by this time every one of my readers French readers or English readers understands clearly and perspicuously the representation or memorial of the French manmidwife and the answer of the doctors of the Sorbonne thereto and in this opinion too before any English translation is given Mr  Tristram Shandy  gives his compliments to those doctors in the following words  "Mr  Tristram Shandy  's compliments to Messrs  Le Moyne De Romigny  and  De Marcilly  hopes they all rested well the night after so tiresome a consultation He begs to know whether after the ceremony of marriage and before that of consummation the baptizing all the HOMUNCULI at once slapdash by injection would not be a shorter and safer cut still on condition as above that if the HOMUNCULI do well and come safe into the world after this that each and every of them shall be baptized again on condition and provided in the second place that the thing can be done which Mr  Shandy  apprehends it may by means of a syringe and without any prejudice to the father"  This and the foregoing passages are what I propose labouring hard to rescue from the claws of  moral  though  pseudo critics  who would insinuate that they are not only directly  inconsistent  with all morality but evidently  antichristian  As to you my worthy  though incomprehensible  readers I dare say no such thoughts ever entered your brain nor indeed how should they for what immorality can there be in giving the substance of a  theological  dispute especially when every thing that can possibly give offence is expressed in a foreign tongue  The latter part of this conclusion or query or whatever you please to call it I do not so much insist upon as in that case I should share the guilt if there were any with my friend  Tristram  Shandy  for having exposed him in English Therefore having said  all I can say  in defence of his morals and orthodoxy in this respect I beg you will conclude with me that in this part he no way deviates from his general moral character  This I think is reasoning ay and sound reasoning too enough for one chapter and so we proceed to the next  CHAP X  THIS chapter though entirely upon  modesty  cannot properly be called a  modest chapter  notwithstanding there is very little of the author's vanity  in it therefore any of my  seven hundred and fifty  readers being females may pass it over if they chuse it and my lazy readers in particular of either gender the epicene not excluded are carefully recommended to avoid it as perhaps after all they will have occasion to recur to a dictionary or be obliged to say their A B C numerically before they understand it    "Then it can be out of nothing in the world quoth my uncle  Toby  in the simplicity of his heart but MODESTYMy sister I dare say added he does not care to let a man come so near her ****"  Vide p vol  One would be inclined to imagine that a man of my friend  Tristram  's strict  morals had concluded the sentence before the asterisms and that they were a meer error of the press though they had run through two editions if he had not immediately after added    "My sister may hap" quoth my uncle  Toby  "does not chuse to let a man come so near her **** make this dash'tis an aposiopesisTake the dash away and write  backside  'tis bawdy Scratch backside out and put cover'd way in'tis a metaphorand I dare say as fortification ran so much in my uncle Toby's head that if he had been left to have added one word to the sentencethat word was it"  Vide p vol  Notwithstanding my strict reliance upon  Tristram  's veracity and my great opinion of his uncle Toby's purity of expression I cannot be induced to believe that his uncle Toby either said  backside bawdy  or not  bawdy  or was metaphorically inclined to express himself in a  covered way  Naked truth I believe he thought the bestfour  asterisms  are but four  asterisms  and ever since asterisms have been in use we have always been taught that their number should be supplied by a like number of letters to make out the sense  Curious indefatigable unblushing readers consider what letters will properly supply the place without infringing upon the senseMind I have already exploded uncle  Toby  's "backside" and "covered way"What do you think  of head there are but four letters in this word Ay but it will not do it is quite  opposite  to the author's meaning  Arm  and  leg  have but three letters and be hanged to them  Thigh  comes near it but then there is a letter too many I have itthe  third  the  twentieth  the  thirteenth  and the  nineteenth  letters of the English alphabet certainly compose the word though it is not to be found in any Lexicon extantI hope  CHAP XI  THIS chapter I intend to devote entirely to  hobby horses    A hobbyhorse is a machine which boys ay and girls too frequently sit astride upon and which going up and down affords them much amusement  Mr  Tristram Shandy  's hobbyhorse I take to be **** four asterisms as explained Chap X and his favourite argument the  argumentum ad rem  as he applies it in page volume the st of his work  My  hobbyhorse  is a  goose quill  upon which I have rode through life to this period and by which I hope to get  hobbyhorsically  to my journey's end without much fatigue  N B  My hobbyhorse never goes on so briskly as upon a journey of prescriptions and receiptsfor instead of paying upon the first road I receive toll and the last excursion I seldom make but for the sale of some young  hobby  the offspring of my goose quill which never stumbles without I meet with a lady when  I get out of the way of the two first syllables of my name and canter on simple  Strokius  though to be sure there is no more resemblance between a K and a C than there is between my  hobbyhorse  and a lady's  pad    CHAP XII  THE foregoing chapters will give my readers a very competent idea of Mr  Tristram Shandy  's morality and religion for though there may be some few slips of the pen particularly where the four asterisms are left to supply the place of a word the drift of this work evidently appears to be  moral  and  orthodox  particularly the last which is manifestly evinced by his scheme of baptizing  slap dash  to use his own words all mankind  even before they are born and thereby prevent any heretical or schismatical opinions except in matters of faith whatever  CHAP XIII  I AM now going to consider my friend  Tristram Shandy  as a politician or rather as he is considered by the greatest politicians of  Europe Asia Africa  and  America    This it must be owned is an arduous task but my title page is already printed and I cannot deviate from it but before I begin I make this solemn protestation that if any of the writers of our weekly political papers either composed of a sheet and a half to avoid the  payment of duty or in the form of a journal whereby a whole week's news is besides a political essay sucked in at the easy charge of twopence halfpenny or in the shape of a chronicle where piracies do manifestly abound I say if any printers publishers editors compilers writers authors whether garetteers first floorers house keepers chariotkeepers shopkeepers stallkeepers or cellarkeepers hawkers and chapmen do in manifest opposition to this my will dare to borrow rob steal quote cite mention hint except in my own genteel advertisement  from of  or  that  there is such a book in  esse  as this present volume I hereby declare solemnly  I believe I shall prosecute them  and that I certainly will never give them or either of them respectively a good introductory letter or essay  or so much as a paragraph or hint concerning such things as no one else can be acquainted with but myself those are my  ideas  nay I furthermore declare I will never read peruse  runover  or look upon in any light whatever their papers  c c c  respectively but give my opinion which goes a great way with  myself  right or wrong and damn them all  N B  Every part of this and these foregoing chapters extends to all the magazines which I did intend to allot a chapter to enumerate as well as the  reviews  without they make very favourable mention of me and this my elaborate work  CHAP XIV  A Politician is truly an amphibious animal and in England he is more inclined to the  herring  than the  monkey  it is quite otherwise in  France  where it is more requisite for a professed politicans to have learnt to dance than to have read  Machiavel  for his arguments are better enforced by a  caper  a  pas grave  or a  baloné  than by the most Syllogistic logic of all the schools  Un politique de Paris  that is a Paris politician enters a coffee room with a  pas de passe pié  makes three  entrechae  at the front lookingglass goes up to the group tells them with a significant air  "nous Fns bien le tour aux Anglois cette campaigne ces fiers insulaires sauront bien tôt faire respect au genie  militaire de la France"  "We shall play the devil with the  English  this campaign Those haughty islanders will soon be taught to respect the military genius of  France  "  he cuts two capers and retires whilst the multitude are admiring his profound knowledge of the interest of princes and every one agrees that  "Monsieur a bien raison" "the orator was quite in the right"  CHAP XV  IN  England  every coffeehouse has its president who harrangues the circle that catch his opinions and support them in their different districts  "Why Sir I repeat it what have we to do with continental connections Are not our ships our floating bulwarks  our only protection Could the king of in return for all the assistance we have given him have made such a diversion as the brave captain  Elliot  did in St  George  's channel"  I say Sir would all the german princes put together have defeated  Thurot  "  Is  not our trade and our navigation the subject of this war and what is our navigation to the  inland parts of Germanytrifling  I repeat it  very trifling  And yet neglect the herring fishery that  Peruvian  seamine and scarce pay any attention to those elaborate and well digested schemes of the great  Henriques  "  The learned deep sighted clear witted eloquent president of coffeehouse after having made this  popular  and sagacious harrangue laid hold of my worthy friend Mr  Tristram Shandy    "Here says he here is the man after my  own heart whose political notions are as clear and selfevident as my own There is the touchstone of public measures the whetstone of trade and navigation and the grindstone of malversation"  CHAP XVI  SOME of my incomprehensible readers may be greatly surprized at finding themselves got into such unexpected good company and being conveyed even without a passport whilst we are in the midst of a war with  France  from  London  to  Paris  there dip into a political conversation with one of their greatest politicians got back safe to  England  without being put into the Bastile for dissenting with him in his political opinions and  holding  French  faith  French  generals  French  admirals as well as  French  minisers in the highest contempt then tran+sported into one of our most oratorial coffeehouses and become auditors to a second  Cicero  and a third  Demosthenes    All this shall be explained to you in a few words It was necessary how else could I have illustrated my assertion that a  politician  is an  amphibious animal  How else could I have demonstrated that he has more of the monkey in him in  France  and more of the  herring  in him in  England  As to the Parisian we dropt him a chapter or two ago but we have not yet done with  Cicero  or  Demosthenes  which ever you please to call him You shall have some more conversation with him presently and take my word for it he is abstracted from oratory a very shrewd sensible fellow and according  to the common saying  "sees as far into a millstone as another man"  CHAP XVII  IT may be necessary to inform some of my readers that we are not yet got out of coffeehouse in streetNohere we are yet as attentive as ever to Mr  Profound  that is the gentleman's name in the black full bottom wig and the green spectacles who has by this time thrown down a dish of coffee in enforcing his argument upon the  touchstones whetstones  and  grindstones  taken two pinches of snuff and opened  Tristram Shandy  exactly at page  "Was I an absolute prince he would say pulling up his breeches with both his hands as he rose from his arm chair I would appoint able judges at every avenue of my metropolis who should take cognizance of every fools business who came thereand if upon a fair and candid hearing it appeared not of weight sufficient to leave his own home and come up bag and baggage with his wife and children farmers sons  c c  at his back they should all be sent back from constable to constable like vagrants as they were to the place of their legal settlements By this means I shall take care that my metropolis tottered not through its own weight that the head be no longer too big for the body that the extremes now wasted and pin'd in be restored to their due  share of nourishment and regain with it their natural strength and beauty I would effectually provide that the meadows and corn fields of my dominions skould laugh and sing"  Oh excellent metaphor cried Mr  Profound  in extasy worthy of the great pen from whence it flows  "That good chear and hospitality flourish once more and that such weight and influence be put thereby into the hands of the squirality of my kingdom as should counterpoise what I perceive my nobility are now taking from them"  GreatGreat  Tristram  and see how elegantly he illustrates this immediately after  "Why are there so few palaces and gentlemens seats he would ask with some emotion as he walked across  the room throughout so many delicious provinces in  France  whence is it that the few remaining chateaus amongst them are so dismantled so unfurnished and in so ruinous and desolate a condition Because Sir he would say in that kingdom no man has any country interest to support the little interest of any kind which any man has any where in it is concentrated in the court and the looks of the grand monarch by the sunshine of whose countenance or the clouds which pass acro  s it every French man lives or dies"  Here Mr  Profound  made a pause after which he addressed himself to us Well gentlemen what do you think of this great political writeryou may talk of your Machiavel's and your Sommers's  and your Burnet's But what are they when compared to him how clearly he states the case when he has a mind for it and then again when he chuses to screen himself in a kind of parable how elegantly he does it  "Another political reason says  Tristram  prompted my father so strongly to guard against the least evil accident in my mother's lyingin in the country was That any such instance would infallibly throw a balance of power too great already into the weaker vessels of the gentry in his own or higher stationswhich with the many usurped rights which that part of the constitution was hourly establishingwould in the end prove fatal to the monarchical system of domestic government established in the first creation of things by God"  What can he mean here resumed Mr  Profound  but pecuniary influence in elections particularly in boroughs and yet there is not one in a hundred takes it in that sense I tell you gentlemen  Tristram Shandy  is one compleat system of modern politics and that to understand him there is as much occasion for a key as there is for a catalogue to the Harleian library I own that I should not myself have penetrated so far as I have notwithstanding my great reading in works of this nature if I had not had the opportunity of supping the other evening with the author who let me into the whole affair I advised him to publish a key but he told me it was too dangerousWhat is the Siege of  Namur  which he often mentions but the Siege of Fort St Philip's in Minorca  or the wound his uncle Toby received there but the distress the nation was thrown into thereupon His application to the study of fortification and the knowledge he therein gained means nothing else but the rectitude and clear sightedness of the administration which afterwards took up the reins of government This is a master piece of allegory beyond all the poets of this or any period whatever There is but one fault to be found with Mr  Tristram Shandy  as a politicianthat is making  Yorick  's horse so leanbut then he  is armed at all points  I think too he should have told us the horse was white to have made the symbolical application but he did not dare declare himself so openly upon this headhe told me so Gentlemen continued he I will only read to you one passage more and leave you to make  your remarks  "In a word he would say error was error no matter where it fell whether in a fraction or a pound'twas alike fatal to truth and she was kept down at the bottom of her well as inevitably by a mistake in the dust of a butterfly's wingas in the disk of the sun the moon and all the stars of heaven put together He would often lament that it was for want of considering this properly and of applying it skilfully to civil matters as well as to speculative truths that so many things in this world werethat the political arch was giving way"  do you observe gentlemen how forcibly he speaks here  and that the very foundation of our excellent constitution in church and state were so sapped as estimators reported"  CHAP XVIII  WHEN Mr  Profound  had got thus far a fit of coughing took him which I was apprehensive would very near have carried him off I waited with great patience near a quarter of an hour till he had recovered himself in expectation of having gained from him an explanation of this passage which he certainly would have given notwithstanding he told us in the beginning he would leave us to our own reflections but how unluckily mortifying was it both for you and me readers that after the fit left him there was not a sufficient number of auditors remaining to form a committee and Mr  Profound  went away as much out of temper with his cough as with his company  I have regularly attended the house for above a fortnight past in expectation of meeting him when tears speak my grief I yesterday learned he died the night before and all my hopes of an explanation of this passage are at an end  I propose erecting here a monument to the memory of  Profound  in the same manner as  Tristram  has to that of  Yorick    Alas poor PROFOUND  I have just received the mortifying news that my printer has never a  black  copperplate  to subjoin but I have desired him to borrow  Tristram  's of his printer and if he will but lend it you may depend upon being as well  amused  and  enlightened  here as you were in reading the  seventy third  and  seven fourth  pages of the st volume of  Tristram Shandy    CHAP XIX  I Told you incomprehensible readers you know your number by this time what a clever fellow  Profound  was so that I hope you did not lose a word that he said but if you think that there was only a single syllable that you did not attend to I insist upon your returning back to the three preceding chapters as you will swear else I have not fulfilled the promise of my title page  "explaining  the politics of  Tristram  "  which can be done no other way than in the words of my deceased friend Friend did I say Yes I repeat it a  great friend  and what is more and difficult to believe a  political friend  who has enabled me to throw such light upon our author and clear the understandings of seven hundred and fifty incomprehensible readers  CHAP XX  THUS much for Mr  Tristram Shandy's politics    CHAP XXI  SOME of the most comprehensible of my readers must have observed that I have scattered very little Greek and Latin about this work and that I have even made shift with an  English motto  notwithstanding a classical one is so essential to the well understanding and recommending a book even though of this consequence To be honest I must own that none of the family of the  Kunastrokius  's were any great Grecians and as to  Latin  I always found it a very saleable commodity at the  physicalmarket  But if any of my readers should be desirous to divert themselves with a Greek or Latin quotation I would advise them to read me with  Homer Herodotus Virgil Horace  and a few more of  the classics by their sides and if they understand them  not else  they have nothing to do but now and then dip into one or other of them and please themselves and save me a great deal of unnecessary trouble  CHAP XXII  THIS chapter is intirely upon  propriety  and must therefore of course with or without a  pun  be a very proper chapter  Digressions are the soul of a work as Mr  Tristram Shandy  has very judiciously discovered and he has as tenaciously adhered to this discovery wherefore he may with the greatest propriety be stiled the king of  episodical writers    As to absurdities it is absurd to suppose there can be any in a work of  humour  true humour I mean I appeal to all and every one of my  incomprehensible readers  if there be any absurdity in the work now before them I will answer for you all in one word none In regard to my friend  Tristram  what are generally reckoned absurdities in him are his greatest beauties Though he  ridicules  plates and cuts by a  ridiculous  stamp may he not with great propriety prefix a frontispiece to his second edition Every one must own that a frontispiece when executed by a masterly hand is an embellishment to a work and who can be so out of the way as to find fault with an embellishment which evidently inhances the value of the production  Again with respect to dedications Though that in the middle of his first volume certainly means if any thing a burlesque upon dedications of what nature so ever yet we find in his second edition he has dedicated this moralpolitical not  bawdy ludicrous  as some may imagine it piece to one of the most respectable characters in  England  But  who  can take offence at it  What I have said in this chapter concerning Mr  Tristram Shandy  's propriety sets some of the mistaken errors of that work in the clearest points of light in which my readers incomprehensible as they are must certainly view them  CHAP XXIII  LIKE most other writers when I have nothing more to say I draw near a conclusion but as it is necessary for several reasons which I could explain if I chose but not having promised it in my title page I am not compelled to it to eke out another chapter I must say something if it be only to contradict what I have hitherto saidbut this I shall not do and so continue as follows  If after all I have not sufficiently cleared my friend  Tristram Shandy  from any attacks of the false critics for want of morals or for any small heresy in politics no part of this can be laid to his charge as he was then  unborn  as he still remains in a  literal sense    But to wave all considerations of this nature my readers as incomprehensible as they are must have perceived e'er now that  Tristram Shandy  is the most  excellent  I was going to say  est  by way of a  superlative superlative  suitable to the occasion piece that has appeared for many years besides according to  Hubras    The worth of every thing Is just as much as it will bring and this is the dearest production to the bookseller if  not  to the public that has appeared for near half a centry  ADVERTISEMENT TO THE NOBILITY and GENTRY OF ALL EUROPE  AS I expect in consequence of the foregonig work to receive invitations on every hand for parties of pleasure regales dinners and suppers in order to prevent confusion in my engagements and that I may not make appointments with persons I am intirely ignorant of I beg they would with all convenient dispatch send their titles  names and places of abode with cards to my bookseller's that I may pay compliments to them according to their different ranks or where upon a footing according to their alphabetical succession  N B  Such noblemen c as chuse to give me testimony of their approbation of this book by particular marks of their beneficence will please to take notice that no  living  however lucrative can be accepted as I am not in orders  ☞ I am particularly obliged to the managers of both the houses whose kind intentions I already anticipate in favouring me with the freedom of their respective theatres and they may depend upon my paying my compliments  to them in due time but I am afraid I cannot accept of Mr 's kind invitation to his house at  Hampton  this summer  FINIS
