PLAYS BY DR GOLDSMITH  THE GOODNATUR'D MAN A COMEDY  AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  FIRST PRINTED IN MDCCLXVIII  PREFACE  WHEN I undertook to write a comedy I confess I was strongly prepossessed in favour of the poets of the last age and strove to imitate them The term genteel comedy was then unknown amongst us and little more was desired by an audience than nature and humour in whatever walks of life they were most conspicuous The author of the following scenes never imagined that more would be expected of him and therefore to delineate character has been his principal aim Those who know any thing of composition are sensible that in pursuing humour it will sometimes lead us into the recesses of the mean I was even tempted to look for it in the master of a spunginghouse but in deference to the public taste grown of late perhaps too delicate the scene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the representation In deference also to the judgment of a few friends who think in a particular way the scene is here restored The author submits it to the  reader in his closet and hopes that too much refinement will not banish humour and character from ours as it has already done from the French theatre Indeed the French comedy is now become so very elevated and sentimental that it has not only banished humour and Moliere from the stage but it has banished all spectators too  Upon the whole the author returns his thanks to the public for the favourable reception which the GoodNatur'd Man has met with and to Mr Colman in particular for his kindness to it It may not also be improper to assure any who shall hereafter write for the theatre that merit or supposed merit will ever be a sufficient passport to his protection  PROLOGUE  WRITTEN BY DR JOHNSON  SPOKEN BY MR BENSLEY  PREST by the load of life the weary mind  Surveys the general toil of human' kind  With cool submission joins the lab'ring train  And social sorrow loses half its pain  Our anxious bard without complaint may share  This bustling season's epidemic care  Like Caesar's pilot dignify'd by fate  Tost in one common storm with all the great  Distrest alike the statesman and the wit  When one a borough courtsand one the pit  The busy candidates for power and fame  Have hopes and fears and wishes just the same  Disabled both to combat or to fly  Must hear all taunts and hear without reply  Uncheck'd on both loud rabbles vent their rage  As mongrels bay the lion in a cage  Th' offended burgess hoards his angry tale  For that blest year when all that vote may rail  Their schemes of spite the poet's foes dismiss  Till that glad night when all that hate may hiss  " This day the powder'd curls and golden coat"  Says swelling Crispin "begg'd a cobler's vote"  " This night our wit" the pert apprentice cries  " Lies at my feet I hiss him and he dies"  The great 'tis true can charm th' electing tribe  The bard may supplicate but cannot bribe  Yet judg'd by those whose voices ne'er were sold  He feels no want of illpersuading gold  But confident of praise if praise be due  Trusts without fear to merit and to you  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  Mr Honeywood  Mr POWELL  Croaker  Mr

house  Enter Sir WILLIAM HONEYWOOD JARVIS  Sir WILLIAM  GOOD Jarvis make no apologies for this honest bluntness Fidelity like yours is the best excuse for every freedom  JARVIS  I can't help being blunt and being very angry too when I hear you talk of disinheriting so good so worthy a young gentleman as your nephew my master All the world loves him  Sir WILLIAM  Say rather that he loves all the world that is his fault  JARVIS  I'm sure there is no part of it more dear to him than you are though he has not seen you since he was a child  Sir WILLIAM  What signifies his affection to me or how can I be proud of a place in a heart where every sharper and coxcomb find an easy entrance  JARVIS  I grant you that he is rather too goodnatur'd that he's too much every man's man that he laughs this minute with one and cries the next with another but whose instructions may he thank for all this  Sir WILLIAM  Not mine sure My letters to him during my employment in Italy taught him only that philosophy which might prevent not defend his errors  JARVIS  Faith begging your honour's pardon I'm sorry they taught him any philosophy at all it has only serv'd to spoil him This same philosophy is a good horse in the stable but an arrant jade on a journey For my own part whenever I hear him mention the name on't I'm always sure he's going to play the fool  Sir WILLIAM  Don't let us ascribe his faults to his philosophy I entreat you No Jarvis his good nature arises rather from his fears of offending the importunate than his desire of making the deserving happy  JARVIS  What it rises from I don't know But to be sure every body has it that asks it  Sir WILLIAM  Ay or that does not ask it I have been now for some time a concealed spectator of his follies and find them as boundless as his dissipation  JARVIS  And yet faith he has some fine name or other For them all He calls his extravagance generosity and his trusting every body universal benevolence It was but last week he went security for a fellow whose face he scarce knew and that he called an act of exalted mumumunificence ay that was the name he gave it  Sir WILLIAM  And upon that I proceed as my last effort though with very little hopes to reclaim him That very fellow has just absconded and I have taken up the security Now my intention is to involve him in fictitious distress before he has plunged himself into real calamity To arrest him for that very debt to clap an officer upon him and then let him see which of his friends will come to his relief  JARVIS  Well if I could but any way see him thoroughly vexed every groan of his would be music to me yet faith I believe it impossible I have tried to fret him myself every morning these three years but instead of being angry he sits as calmly to hear me scold as he does to his hairdresser  Sir WILLIAM  We must try him once more however and I'll go this instant to put my scheme into execution and I don't despair of succeeding as by your means I can have frequent opportunities of being about him without being known What a pity it is Jarvis that any man's goodwill to others should produce so much neglect of himself as to require correction Yet we must touch his weaknesses with a delicate hand There are some faults so nearly allied to excellence that we can scarce weed out the vice without eradicating the virtue  Exit  JARVIS  Well go thy ways Sir William Honeywood It is not without reason that the world allows thee to be the best of men But here comes his hopeful nephew the strange goodnatur'd foolsh openheartedAnd yet all his faults are such that one loves him still the better for them  Enter HONEYWOOD  HONEYWOOD  Well Jarvis what messages from my friends this morning  JARVIS  You have no friends  HONEYWOOD  Well from my acquaintance then  JARVIS  Pulling out bills  A few of our usual cards of compliment that's all This bill from your taylor this from your mercer and this from the little broker in Crookedlane He says he has been at a great deal of trouble to get back the money you borrowed  HONEYWOOD  That I don't know but I'm sure we were at a great deal of trouble in getting him to lend it  JARVIS  He has lost all patience  HONEYWOOD  Then he has lost a very good thing  JARVIS  There's that ten guineas you were fending to the poor gentleman and his children in the Fleet I believe that would stop his mouth for a while at least  HONEYWOOD  Ay Jarvis but what will fill their mouths in the mean time Must I be cruel because he happens to be importunate and to relieve his avarice leave them to insupportable distress  JARVIS  'Sdeath Sir the question now is how to relieve yourself YourselfHav'nt I reason to be out of my senses when I see things going at sixes and sevens  HONEYWOOD  Whatever reason you may have for being out of your senses I hope you'll allow that I'm not quite unreasonable for continuing in mine  JARVIS  You're the only man alive in your present situation that could do soEvery thing upon the waste There's Miss Richland and her fine fortune gone already and upon the point of being given to your rival  HONEYWOOD  I'm no man's rival  JARVIS  Your uncle in Italy preparing to disinherit you your own fortune almost spent and nothing but pressing creditors false friends and a pack of drunken servants that your kindness has made unfit for any other family  HONEYWOOD  Then they have the more occasion for being in mine  JARVIS  Soh What will you have done with him that I caught stealing your plate in the pantry In the fact I caught him in the fact  HONEYWOOD  In the fact If so I really think that we should pay him his Wages and turn him off  JARVIS  He shall be turn'd off at Tyburn the dog we'll hang him if it be only to frighten the rest of the family  HONEYWOOD  No Jarvis it's enough that we have lost what he has stolen let us not add to it the loss of a fellow creature  JARVIS  Very fine well here was the footman just now to complain of the butler he says he does most work and ought to have most wages  HONEYWOOD  That's but just though perhaps here comes the butler to complain of the footman  JARVIS  Ay its the way with them all from the scullion to the privycounsellor If they have a bad master they keep quarrelling with him if they have a good master they keep quarrelling with one another  Enter BUTLER drunk  BUTLER  Sir I'll not stay in the family with Jonathan you must part with him or part with me that's the exexexposition of the matter Sir  HONEYWOOD  Full and explicit enough But what's his fault good Philip  BUTLER  Sir he's given to drinking Sir and I shall have my morals corrupted by keeping such company  HONEYWOOD  Ha' ha He has such a diverting way  JARVIS  O quite amusing  BUTLER  I find my wines agoing Sir and liquors don't go without mouths Sir I hate a drunkard Sir  HONEYWOOD  Well well Philip I'll hear yon upon that another time so go to bed now  JARVIS  To bed Let him go the devil  BUTLER  Begging your honour's pardon and begging your pardon master Jarvis I'll not go to bed nor to the devil neither I hare enough to do to mind my cellar I forgot your honour Mr Croaker is below I came on purpose to tell you  HONEYWOOD  Why didn't you shew him up blockhead  BUTLER  Shew him up Sir With all my heart Sir Up or down all's one to me  Exit  JARVIS  Ay we have one or other of that family in this house from morning till night He comes on the  old affair I suppose The match between his son that's just returned from Paris and Miss Richland the young lady he's guardian to  HONEYWOOD  Perhaps so Mr Croaker knowing my friendship for the young lady has got it into his head that I can perswade her to what I please  JARVIS  Ah if you loved yourself but half as well as she loves you we should soon fee a marriage that would set all things to rights again  HONEYWOOD  Love me Sure Jarvis you dream No no her intimacy with me never amounted to more than friendshipmere friendship That she is the most lovely woman that ever warm'd the human heart with desire I own But never let me harbour a thought of making her unhappy by a connection with one so unworthy her merits as I am No Jarvis it shall be my study to serve her even in spite of my wishes and to secure her happiness though it destroys my own  JARVIS  Was ever the like I want patience  HONEYWOOD  Besides Jarvis though I could obtain Miss Richland's consent do you think I could succeed with her guardian or Mrs Croaker his wife who tho' both very fine in their way are yet a little opposite in their dispositions you know  JARVIS  Opposite enough heaven knows the very reverse of each other she all laugh and no joke he always complaining and never sorrowful a fretful poor soul that has a new distress for every hour in the four and twenty  HONEYWOOD  Hum hush he's coming up he'll hear you  JARVIS  One who's voice is a passing bell  HONEYWOOD  Well well go do  JARVIS  A raven that bodes nothing but mischief a coffin and cross bones a bundle of rue a sprig of deadly night shadea  Honeywood stopping his mouth at last pushes him off  Exit  Jarvis  HONEYWOOD  I must own my old monitor is not entirely wrong There is something in my friend Croaker's conversation that quite depresses me His very mirth is an antidote to all gaiety and his appearance has a stronger effect on my spirits than an undertaker's shopMr Croaker this is such a satisfaction  Enter CROAKER  CROAKER  A pleasant morning to Mr Honeywood and many of them How is this you look most shockingly  to day my dear friend I hope this weather does not affect your spirits To be sure if this weather continuesI say nothingBut God send we be all better this day three months  HONEYWOOD  I heartily concur in the wish though I own not in your apprehensions  CROAKER  May be not indeed what signifies what weather we have in a country going to ruin like ours taxes rising and trade falling Money flying out of the kingdom and Jesuits swarming into it I know at this time no less than an hundred and twentyseven Jesuits between Charingcross and Templebar  HONEYWOOD  The Jesuits will scarce pervert you or me I should hope  CROAKER  May be not Indeed what signifies whom they pervert in a country that has scarce any religion to lose I'm only afraid for our wives and daughters  HONEYWOOD  I have no apprehensions for the ladies I assure you  CROAKER  May be not Indeed what signifies whether they be perverted or no the women in my time were good for something I have seen a lady drest from top to toe in her own manufactures formerly But  now adays the devil a thing of their own manufactures about them except their faces  HONEYWOOD  But however these faults may be practised abroad you don't find them at home either with Mrs Croaker Olivia or Miss Richland  CROAKER  The best of them will never be canoniz'd for a saint when she's dead By the bye my dear friend I don't find this match between Miss Richland and my son much relished either b y one side or t'other  HONEYWOOD  I thought otherwise  CROAKER  Ah Mr Honeywood a little of your fine serious advice to the young lady might go far I know she has a very exalted opinion of your understanding  HONEYWOOD  But would not that be usurping an authority that more properly belongs to yourself  CROAKER  My dear friend you know but little of my authority at home People think indeed because they see me come out in a morning thus with a pleasant face and to make my friends merry that all's well within But I have cares that would break an heart of stone My wife has so encroached upon every one of my privileges that I'm now no more than a mere lodger in my own house  HONEYWOOD  But a little spirit exerted on your side might perhaps restore your authority  CROAKER  No though I had the spirit of a lion I do rouze sometimes But what then always haggling and haggling A man is tired of getting the better before his wife is tired of losing the victory  HONEYWOOD  It's a melancholy consideration indeed that our chief comforts often produce our greatest anxieties and that an encrease of our possessions is but an inlet to new disquietudes  CROAKER  Ah my dear friend these were the very words of poor Dick Doleful to me not a week before he made away with himself Indeed Mr Honeywood I never fee you but you put me in mind of poorDick Ah there was merit neglected for you and so true a friend we lov'd each other for thirty years and yet he never asked me to lend him a single farthing  HONEYWOOD  Pray what could induce him to commit so rash an action at last  CROAKER  I don't know some people were malicious enough to say it was keeping company with me because we used to meet now and then and open our hearts  to each other To be sure I loved to hear him talk and he loved to hear me talk poor dear Dick He us'd to say that Croaker rhim'd to joker and so we us'd to laughPoor Dick  Going to cry  HONEYWOOD  His fate affects me  CROAKER  Ay he grew sick of this miserable life where we do nothing but eat and grow hungry dress and undress get up and lie down while reason that should watch like a nurse by our side falls as fast asleep as we do  HONEYWOOD  To say truth if we compare that part of life which is to come by that which we have past the prospect is hideous  CROAKER  Life at the greatest and best is but a froward child that must be humour'd and coax'd a little till it falls asleep and then all the care is over  HONEYWOOD  Very true Sir nothing can exceed the vanity of our existence but the folly of our pursuits We wept when we came into the world and every day tells us why  CROAKER  Ah my dear friend it is a perfect satisfaction to be miserable with you My son Leontine shan't lose the benefit of such fine conversation I'll just step  home for him I am willing to shew him so much seriousness in one scarce older than himselfAnd what if I bring my last letter to the Gazetteer on the encrease and progress of earthquakes It will amuse us I promise you I there prove how the late earthquake is coming round to pay us another visit from London to Lisbon from Lisbon to the Canary Islands from the Canary Islands to Palmyra from Palmyra to Constantinople and so from Constantinople back to London again  Exit  HONEYWOOD  Poor Croaker his situation deserves the utmost pity I shall scarce recover my spirits these three days Sure to live upon such terms is worse than death itself And yet when I consider my own situation a broken fortune an hopeless passion friends in distress the wish but not the power to serve them  pausing and sighing  Enter BUTLER  BUTLER  More company below Sir Mrs Croaker and Miss Richland shall I shew them up but they're shewing up themselves  Exit  Enter Mrs CROAKER and Miss RICHLAND  Miss RICHLAND  You're always in such spirits  Mrs CROAKER  We have just come my dear Honeywood from the auction There was the old deaf dowager as  usual bidding like a fury against herself And then so curious in antiques herself the most genuine piece of antiquity in the whole collection  HONEYWOOD  Excuse me ladies if some uneasiness from friendship makes me unfit to share in this good humour I know you'll pardon me  Mrs CROAKER  I vow he seems as melancholy as if he had taken a dose of my husband this morning Well if Richland here can pardon you I must  Miss RICHLAND  You would seem to insinuate madam that I have particular reasons for being disposed to refuse it  Mrs CROAKER  Whatever I insinuate my dear don't be so ready to wish an explanation  Miss RICHLAND  I own I should be sorry Mr Honeywood's long friendship and mine should be misunderstood  HONEYWOOD  There's no answering for others madam But I hope you'll never find me presuming to offer more than the most delicate friendship may readily allow  Miss RICHLAND  And I shall be prouder of such a tribute from you than the most passionate professions from others  HONEYWOOD  My own sentiments madam friendship is a disinterested commerce between equals love an abject intercourse between tyrants and slaves  Miss RICHLAND  And without a compliment I know none more disinterested or more capable of friendship than Mr Honeywood  Mrs CROAKER  And indeed I know nobody that has more friends at least among the ladies Miss Fruzz Miss Odbody and Miss Winterbottom praise him in all companies As for Miss Biddy Bundle she's his professed admirer  Miss RICHLAND  Indeed an admirer I did not know Sir you were such a favourite there But is she seriously so handsome Is she the mighty thing talked of  HONEYWOOD  The town madam seldom begins to praise a lady's beauty till she's beginning to lose it  Smiling  Mrs CROAKER  But she's resolv'd never to lose it it seems For as her natural face decays her skill improves in making the artificial one Well nothing diverts me more than one of those fine old dressy things who thinks to conceal her age by every where exposing her person sticking herself up in the front of a sidebox  trailing through a minuet at Almack's and then in the public gardens looking for all the world like one of the painted ruins of the place  HONEYWOOD  Every age has its admirers ladies While you perhaps are trading among the warmer climates of youth there ought to be some to carry on an useful commerce in the frozen latitudes beyond fifty  Miss RICHLAND  But then the mortifications they must suffer before they can be fitted out for traffic I have seen one of them fret an whole morning at her hairdresser when all the fault was her face  HONEYWOOD  And yet I'll engage has carried that face at last to a very good market This goodnatur'd town madam has husbands like spectacles to fit every age from fifteen to fourscore  Mrs CROAKER  Well you're a dear goodnatur'd creature But you know you're engaged with us this morning upon a strolling party I want to shew Olivia the town and the things I believe I shall have business for you for the whole day  HONEYWOOD  I am sorry madam I have an appointment with Mr Croaker which it is impossible to put off  Mrs CROAKER  What with my husband then I'm resolved to take no refusal Nay I protest you must You know I never laugh so much as with you  HONEYWOOD  Why if I must I must I'll swear you have put me into such spirits Well do you find jest and I'll find laugh I promise you We'll wait for the chariot in the next room  Exeunt  Enter LEONTINE and OLIVIA  LEONTINE  There they go thoughtless and happy My dearest Olivia what would I give to see you capable of sharing in their amusements and as cheerful as they are  OLIVIA  How my Leontine how can I be cheerful when I have so many terrors to oppress me the fear of being detected by this family and the apprehensions of a censuring world when I must be detected  LEONTINE  The world my love what can it say At worst it can only say that being compelled by a mercenary guardian to embrace a life you disliked you formed a resolution of flying with the man of your choice that you confided in his honour and took refuge in my father's house the only one where your's could remain without censure  OLIVIA  But consider Leontine your disobedience and my indiscretion your being sent to France to bring home a sister and instead of a sister bringing home  LEONTINE  One dearer than a thousand sisters One that I am convinc'd will be equally dear to the rest of the family when she comes to be known  OLIVIA  And that I fear will shortly be  LEONTINE  Impossible 'till we ourselves think proper to make the discovery My sister you know has been with her aunt at Lyons since she was a child and you find every creature in the family takes you for her  OLIVIA  But mayn't she write mayn't her aunt write  LEONTINE  Her aunt scarce ever writes and all my sister's letters are directed to me  OLIVIA  But won't your refusing Miss Richland for whom you know the old gentleman intends you create a suspicion  LEONTINE  There there's my masterstroke I have resolved not to refuse her nay an hour hence I have consented to go with my father to make her an offer of my heart and fortune  OLIVIA  Your heart and fortune  LEONTINE  Don't be alarm'd my dearest Can Olivia think so meanly of my honour or my love as to suppose I could ever hope for happiness from any but her No my Olivia neither the force nor permit me to add the delicacy of my passion leave any room to suspect me I only offer Miss Richland an heart I am convinc'd she will refuse as I am confident that without knowing it her affections are fixed upon Mr Honeywood  OLIVIA  Mr Honeywood You'll excuse my apprehensions but when your merits come to be put in the balance  LEONTINE  You view them with too much partiality However by making this offer I shew a seeming compliance with my father's command and perhaps upon her refusal I may have his consent to chuse for myself  OLIVIA  Well I submit And yet my Leontine I own I shall envy her even your pretended addresses I consider every look every expression of your esteem as due only to me This is folly perhaps I allow it but it is natural to suppose that merit which  has made an impression on one's own heart may be powerful over that of another  LEONTINE  Don't my life's treasure don't let us make imaginary evils when yon know we have so many real ones to encounter At worst yon know if Miss Richland should consent or my father refuse his pardon it can but end in a trip to Scotland and  Enter CROAKER  CROAKER  Where have you been boy I have been seeking you My friend Honeywood here has been saying such comfortable things Ah he's an example indeed Where is he I left him here  LEONTINE  Sir I believe you may see him and hear him too in the next room he's preparing to go out with the ladies  CROAKER  Good gracioas can I believe my eyes or my ears I'm struck dumb with his vivacity and stunn'd with the loudness of his laugh Was there ever such a transformation  A laugh behind the scenes Croaker mimics it  Ha ha ha there it goes a plague take their balderdash yet I could expect nothing lest when my precious wife was of the party On my conscience I believe she could spread an horselaugh through the pews of a tabernacle  LEONTINE  Since you find so many objections to a wife sir how can you be so earnest in recommending one to me  CROAKER  I have told you and tell you again boy that Miss Richland's fortune must not go out of the family one may find comfort in the money whatever one does in the wife  LEONTINE  But Sir though in obedience to your desire I am ready to marry her it may be possible she has no inclination to me  CROAKER  I'll tell you once for all how it stands A good part of Miss Richland's large fortune consists in a claim upon government which my good friend Mr Lofty assures me the treasury will allow One half of this she is to forfeit by her father's will in case she refuses to marry you So if she rejects you we seize half her fortune if she accepts you we seize the whole and a fine girl into the bargain  LEONTINE  But Sir if you will but listen to reason  CROAKER  Come then produce your reasons I tell you I'm fix'd determined so now produce your reasons When I'm determined I always listen to reason because it can then do no harm  LEONTINE  You have alledged that a mutual choice was the first requisite in matrimonial happiness  CROAKER  Well and you have both of you a mutual choice She has her choiceto marry you or lose half her fortune and you have your choiceto marry her or pack out of doors without any fortune at all  LEONTINE  An only son Sir might expect more indulgence  CROAKER  An only father Sir might expect more obedience besides has not your sister here that never disobliged me in her life as good a right as you He's a sad dog Livy my dear and would take all from you But he shan't I tell you he shan't for you shall have your share  OLIVIA  Dear Sir I wish you'd be convinced that I can never be happy in any addition to my fortune which is taken from his  CROAKER  Well well it's a good child so say no more but come with me and we shall see something that will give us a great deal of pleasure I promise you old Ruggins the currycombmaker lying in state I'm told he makes a very handsome corpse and becomes his coffin prodigiously He was an intimate friend of mine and these are friendly things we ought to do for each other  Exeunt  ACT THE SECOND  SCENE CROAKER'S House  Miss RICHLAND GARNET  Miss RICHLAND  OLIVIA not his sister Olivia not Leontine's sister You amaze me  GARNET  No more his sister than I am I had it all from his own servant I can get any thing from that quarter  Miss RICHLAND  But how Tell me again Garnet  GARNET  Why madam as I told you before instead of going to Lyons to bring home his sister who has been there with her aunt these ten years he never went further than Paris there he saw and fell in love with this young lady by the bye of a prodigious family  Miss RICHLAND  And brought her home to my guardian as his daughter  GARNET  Yes and his daughter she will be If he don't consent to their marriage they talk of trying what a Scotch parson can do  Miss RICHLAND  Well I own they have deceived meAnd so demurely as Olivia carried it toWould you believe it Garnet I told her all my secrets and yet the sly cheat concealed all this from me  GARNET  And upon my word madam I don't much blame her she was loth to trust one with her secrets that was so very bad at keeping her own  Miss RICHLAND  But to add to their deceit the young gentleman it seems pretends to make me serious proposals My guardian and he are to be here presently to open the affair in form You know I am to lose half my fortune if I refuse him  GARNET  Yet what can you do For being as you are in love with Mr Honeywood madam  Miss RICHLAND  How idiot what do you mean In love with Mr Honeywood Is this to provoke me  GARNET  That is madam in friendship with him I meant nothing more than friendship as I hope to be married nothing more  Miss RICHLAND  Well no more of this As to my guardian and his son they shall find me prepared to receive them I'm resolved to accept their proposal with seeming pleasure to mortify them by compliance and so throw the refusal at last upon them  GARNET  Delicious and that will secure your whole fortune to yourself Well who could have thought so innocent a face could cover so much cuteness  Miss RICHLAND  Why girl I Only oppose my prudence to their cunning and practise a lesson they have taught me against themselves  GARNET  Then you're likely not long to want employment for here they come and in close conference  Enter CROAKER LEONTINE  LEONTINE  Excuse me Sir if I seem to hesitate upon the point of putting to the lady so important a question  CROAKER  Lord good Sir moderate your fears you're so plaguy shy that one would think you had changed sexes I tell you we must have the half or the whole Come let me see with what spirit you begin Well why don't you Eh What Well  thenI must it seemsMiss Richland my dear I believe yon guess at our business an affair which my son here comes to open that nearly concerns your happiness  Miss RICHLAND  Sir I should be ungrateful not to be pleased with any thing that comes recommended by you  CROAKER  How boy could you desire a finer opening Why don't you begin I say  To Leont  LEONTINE  'Tis true madam my father madam has some intentionshemof explaining an affairwhichhimselfcan best explain madam  CROAKER  Yes my dear it comes intirely from my son it's all a request of his own madam And I will permit him to make the best of it  LEONTINE  The whole affair is only this madam my father has a proposal to make which he insists none but himself shall deliver  CROAKER  My mind misgives me the fellow will never be brought on  Aside  In short madam you see before you one that loves you one whose whole happiness is all in you  Miss RICHLAND  I never had any doubts of your regard Sir and I hope you can have none of my duty  CROAKER  That's not the thing my little sweeting my love No no another guess lover than I there he stands madam his very looks declare the force of his passionCall up a look you dog  Aside  But then had you seen him as I have weeping speaking soliloquies and blank verse sometimes melancholy and sometimes absent  Miss RICHLAND  I fear Sir he's absent now or such a declaration would have come most properly from himself  CROAKER  Himself madam he would die before he could make such a confession and if he had not a channel for his passion through me it would ere now have drowned his understanding  Miss RICHLAND  I must grant Sir there are attractions in modest diffidence above the force of words A silent address is the genuine eloquence of sincerity  CROAKER  Madam he has forgot to speak any other language silence is become his mother tongue  Miss RICHLAND  And it must be confessed Sir it speaks very powerfully in his favour And yet I shall be  thought too forward in making such a confession shan't I Mr Leontine  LEONTINE  Confusion my reserve will undo me But if modesty attracts her impudence may disgust her I'll try  Aside  Don't imagine from my silence madam that I want a due sense of the honour and happiness intended me My father madam tells me your humble servant is not totally indifferent to you He admires you I adore you and when we come together upon my soul I believe we shall be the happiest couple in all St James's  Miss RICHLAND  If I could flatter myself you thought as you speak Sir  LEONTINE  Doubt my sincerity madam By your dear self I swear Ask the brave if they desire glory ask cowards if they covet safety  CROAKER  Well well no more questions about it  LEONTINE  Ask the sick if they long for health ask misers if they love money ask  CROAKER  Ask a fool if he can talk nonsense What's come over the boy What signifies asking when there's not a soul to give you an answer If you  would ask to the purpose ask this lady's consent to make you happy  Miss RICHLAND  Why indeed Sir his uncommon ardour almost compels meforces me to comply And yet I'm afraid he'll despise a conquest gained with too much ease won't you Mr Leontine  LEONTINE  Confusion  Aside  Oh by no means madam by no means And yet madam you talked of force There is nothing I would avoid so much as compulsion in a thing of this kind No madam I will still be generous and leave you at liberty to refuse  CROAKER  But I tell you Sir the lady is not at liberty It's a match You see she says nothing Silence gives consent  LEONTINE  But Sir she talked of force Consider Sir the cruelty of constraining her inclinations  CROAKER  But I say there's no cruelty Don't you know blockhead that girls have always a roundabout way of saying yes before company So get you both gone together into the next room and hang him that interrupts the tender explanation Get you gone I say I'll not hear a word  LEONTINE  But Sir I must beg leave to insist  CROAKER  Get off you puppy or I'll beg leave to insist upon knocking you down Stupid whelp But I don't wonder the toy takes entirely after his mother  Exeunt Miss  Rich  and  Leont  Enter Mrs CROAKER  Mrs CROAKER  Mr Croaker I bring you something my dear that I believe will make you smile  CROAKER  I'll hold you a guinea of that my dear  Mrs CROAKER  A letter and as I knew the hand I ventur'd to open it  CROAKER  And how can you expect your breaking open my letters should give me pleasure  Mrs CROAKER  Poo it's from your sister at Lyons and contains good news read it  CROAKER  What a Frenchified cover is here That sister of mine has some good qualities but I could never teach her to fold a letter  Mrs CROAKER  Fold a fiddlestick Read what it contains  CROAKER reading  DEAR NICK  AN English gentleman of large fortune has for some time made private though honourable proposals to your daughter Olivia They love each other tenderly and I find she has consented without letting any of the family know to crown his addresses As such good offers don't come every day your own good sense his large fortune and family considerations will induce you to forgive her  Yours ever RACHAEL CROAKER  My daughter Olivia privately contracted to a man of large fortune This is good news indeed My heart never foretold me of this And yet how silly the little baggage has carried it since she came home Not a word on't to the old ones for the world Yet I thought I saw something she wanted to conceal  Mrs CROAKER  Well if they have concealed their amour they shan't conceal their wedding that shall be public I'm resolved  CROAKER  I tell thee woman the wedding is the most foolish part of the ceremony I can never get this woman to think of the more serious part of the nuptial engagement  Mrs CROAKER  What would you have me think of their funeral But come tell me my dear don't you owe more to me than you care to confess Would you have ever been known to Mr Lofty who has undertaken Miss Richland's claim at the treasury but for me Who was it first made him an acquaintance at lady Shabbaroon's rout Who got him to promise us his interest Is not he a backstairs favourite one that can do what he pleases with those that do what they please Is not he an acquaintance that all your groaning and lamentations could never have got us  CROAKER  He is a man of importance I grant you And yet what amazes me is that while he is giving away places to all the world he can't get one for himself  Mrs CROAKER  That perhaps may be owing to his nicety Great men are not easily satisfied  Enter FRENCH SERVANT  SERVANT  An expresse from Monsieur Lofty He vil be vait upon your honour's instrammant He be only giving four five instruction read two three memorial call upon von ambassadeur He vil be vid you in one tree minutes  Mrs CROAKER  You see now my dear What an extensive department Well friend let your master know that we are extremely honoured by this honour Was there any thing ever in a higher style of breeding All messages among the great are now done by express  CROAKER  To be sure no man does little things with more solemnity or claims more respect than he But he's in the right on't In our bad world respect is given where respect is claim'd  Mrs CROAKER  Never mind the world my dear you were never in a pleasanter place in your life Let us now think of receiving him with proper respect  a loud rapping at the door  and there he is by the thundering rap  CROAKER  Ay verily there he is as close upon the heels of his own express as an indorsement upon the back of a bill Well I'll leave you to receive him whilst I go to chide my little Olivia for intending to steal a marriage without mine or her aunt's consent I must seem to be angry or she too may begin to despise my authority  Exit  Enter LOFTY speaking to his Servant  LOFTY  "And if the Venetian ambassador or that teazing creature the marquis should call I'm not at home Dam'me I'll be packhorse to none of them" My dear madam I have just snatched a moment"And if the expresses to his grace be ready let them be sent off they're of importance" Madam I ask a thousand pardons  Mrs CROAKER  Sir this honour  LOFTY  "And Dubardieu if the person calls about the commission let him know that it is made out As for lord Cumbercourt's stale request it can keep cold you understand me" Madam I ask ten thousand pardons  Mrs CROAKER  Sir this honour  LOFTY  "And Dubardieu if the man comes from the Cornish borough you must do him you must do him I say" Madam I ask ten thousand pardons "And if the Russianambassador calls but he will scarce call today I believe" And now madam I have just got time to express my happiness in having the honour of being permitted to profess myself your most obedient humble servant  Mrs CROAKER  Sir the happiness and honour are all mine and yet I'm only robbing the public while I detain you  LOFTY  Sink the public madam when the fair are to be attended Ah could all my hours be so charmingly devoted Sincerely don't you pity us poor creatures in affairs Thus it is eternally solicited for places here teized for pensions there and courted every where I know you pity me Yes I see you do  Mrs CROAKER  Excuse me Sir "Toils of empires pleasures are" as Waller says  LOFTY  Waller Waller is he of the house  Mrs CROAKER  'The modern poet of that name Sir  LOFTY  Oh a modern We men of business despise the moderns and as for the ancients we have no time to read them Poetry is a pretty thing enough for our wives and daughters but not for us Why now here I stand that know nothing of books I say madam I know nothing of books and yet I believe upon a land carriage fishery a stamp act or a jaghire I can talk my two hours without feeling the want of them  Mrs CROAKER  The world is no stranger to Mr Lofty's eminence in every capacity  LOFTY  I vow to gad madam you make me blush I'm nothing nothing nothing in the world a mere obscure gentleman To be sure indeed one or two of the present ministers are pleased to represent me as a formidable man I know they are pleased to bespatter me at all their little dirty levees Yet upon my soul I wander what they see in me to treat me so Measures not men have always been my mark and I vow by all that's honourable my resentment has never done the men as mere men any manner of harmthat is as mere men  Mrs CROAKER  What importance and yet what modesty  LOFTY  Oh if you talk of modesty madam there I own I'm accessible to praise modesty is my foible it was so the duke of Brentford used to say of me "I love Jack Lofty he used to say" no man has a finer knowledge of things quite a man of information and when he speaks upon his legs by the Lord he's prodigious he scouts them and yet all men have their faults too much modesty is his says his grace  Mrs CROAKER  And yet I dare say you don't want assurance when you come to solicit for your friends  LOFTY  O there indeed I'm in bronze Apropos I have just been mentioning Miss Richland's case to a certain personage we must name no names When I ask I'm not to be put off madam No no I take my friend by the button A fine girl Sir great justice in her case A friend of mine Borough interest Business must be done Mr Secretary I say Mr Secretary her business must be done Sir That's my way madam  Mrs CROAKER  Bless me you said all this to the secretary of state did you  LOFTY  I did not say the secretary did I Well curse it since you have found me out I will not deny it It was to the secretary  Mrs CROAKER  This was going to the fountain head at once not applying to the understrappers as Mr Honeywood would have had us  LOFTT  Honeywood he he He was indeed a fine solicitor I suppose you have heard what has just happened to him  Mrs CROAKER  Poor dear man no accident I hope  LOFTY  Undone madam that's all His creditors have taken him into custody A prisoner in his own house  Mrs CROAKER  A prisoner in his own house How At this very time I'm quite unhappy for him  LOFTY  Why so am I The man to be sure was immensely goodnatur'd But then I could never find that he had any thing in him  Mrs CROAKER  His manner to be sure was excessive harmless some indeed thought it a little dull For my part I always concealed my opinion  LOFTY  It can't be concealed madam the man was dull dull as the last new comedy A poor impracticable creature I tried once or twice to know if he was fit for business but he had scarce talents to be groomporter to an orange barrow  Mrs CROAKER  How differently does Miss Richland think of him For I believe with all his faults she loves him  LOFTY  Loves him Does she You should cure her of that by all means Let me see what if she were  sent to him this instant in his present doleful situation My life for it that works her cure Distress is a perfect antidote to love Suppose we join her in the next room Miss Richland is a fine girl has a fine fortune and must not be thrown away Upon my honour madam I have a regard for Miss Richland and rather than she should be thrown away I should think it no indignity to marry her myself  Exeunt  Enter OLIVIA and LEONTINE  LEONTINE  And yet trust me Olivia I had every reason to expect Miss Richland's refusal as I did every thing in my power to deserve it Her indelicacy surprises me  OLIVIA  Sure Leontine there's nothing so indelicate in being sensible of your merit If so I fear I shall be the most guilty thing alive  LEONTINE  But you mistake my dear The same attention I used to advance my merit with you I practised to lessen it with her What more could I do  OLIVIA  Let us now rather consider what's to be done We have both dissembled too longI have always been ashamedI am now quite weary of it Sure  I could never have undergone so much for any other but you  LEONTINE  And you shall find my gratitude equal to your kindest compliance Though our friends should totally forsake us Olivia we can draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune  OLIVIA  Then why should we defer our scheme of humble happiness when it is now in our power I may be the favourite of your father it is true but can it ever be thought that his present kindness to a supposed child will continue to a known deceiver  LEONTINE  I have many reasons to believe it will As his attachments are but few they are lasting His own marriage was a private one as ours may be Besides I have sounded him already at a distance and find all his answers exactly to our wish Nay by an expression or two that dropped from him I am induced to think he knows of this affair  OLIVIA  Indeed But that would be an happiness too great to be expected  LEONTINE  However it be I'm certain you have power over him and am persuaded if you informed him of our situation that he would be disposed to pardon it  OLIVIA  You had equal expectations Leontine from your last scheme with Miss Richland which you find has succeeded most wretchedly  LEONTINE  And that's the best reason for trying another  OLIVIA  If it must be so I submit  LEONTINE  As we could wish he comes this way Now my dearest Olivia be resolute I'll just retire within hearing to come in at a proper time either to share your danger or confirm your victory  Exit  Enter CROAKER  CROAKER  Yes I must forgive her and yet not too easily neither It will be proper to keep up the decorums of resentment a little if it be only to impress her with an idea of my authority  OLIVIA  How I tremble to approach himMight I presume SirIf I interrupt you  CROAKER  No child where I have an affection it is not a little thing that can interrupt me Affection gets over little things  OLIVIA  Sir you're too kind I'm sensible how ill I deserve this partiality Yet heaven knows there is nothing I would not do to gain it  CROAKER  And you have but too well succeeded you little hussey you With those endearing ways of yours on my conscience I could be brought to forgive any thing unless it were a very great offence indeed  OLIVIA  But mine is such an offenceWhen you know my guiltYes you shall know it though I feel the greatest pain in the confession  CROAKER  Why then if it be so very great a pain you may spare yourself the trouble for I know every syllable of the matter before you begin  OLIVIA  Indeed Then I'm undone  CROAKER  Ay miss you wanted to steal a match without letting me know it did you But I'm not worth being consulted I suppose when there's to be a marriage in my own family No I'm to have no hand in the disposal of my own children No I'm nobody I'm to be a mere article of family lumbe a piece of crack'd china to be stuck up in a corner  OLIVIA  Dear Sir nothing but the dread of your authority could induce us to conceal it from you  CROAKER  No no my consequence is no more I'm as little minded as a dead Russian in winter just stuck up with a pipe in his mouth till there comes a thawIt goes to my heart to vex her  Aside  OLIVIA  I was prepar'd Sir for your anger and despair'd of pardon even while I presume to ask it But your severity shall never abate my affection as my punishment is but justice  CROAKER  And yet you should not despair neither Livy We ought to hope all for the best  OLIVIA  And do you permit me to hope Sir Can I ever expect to be forgiven But hope has too long deceived me  CROAKER  Why then child it shan't deceive you now for I forgive you this very moment I forgive you all and now you are indeed my daughter  OLIVIA  O transport This kindness overpowers me  CROAKER  I was always against severity to our children We have been young and giddy ourselves and we can't expect boys and girls to be old before their time  OLIVIA  What generosity But can you forget the many falsehoods the dissimulation  CROAKER  You did indeed dissemble you urchin you but where's the girl that won't dissemble for an husband My wife and I had never been married if we had not dissembled a little beforehand  OLIVIA  It shall be my future care never to put such generosity to a second trial And as for the partner of my offence and folly from his native honour and the just sense he has of his duty I can answer for him that  Enter LEONTINE  LEONTINE  Permit him thus to answer for himself  Kneeling  Thus Sir let me speak my gratitude for this unmerited forgiveness Yes Sir this even exceeds all your former tenderness I now can boast the most indulgent of fathers The life he gave compared to this was but a trifling blessing  CROAKER  And good Sir who sent for you with that fine tragedy face and flourishing manner I don't know what we have to do with your gratitude upon this occasion  LEONTINE  How Sir Is it possible to be silent when so much obliged Would you refuse me the pleasure of being grateful of adding my thanks to my Olivia's of sharing in the transports that you have thus occasioned  CROAKER  Lord Sir we can be happy enough without your coming in to make up the party I don't know what's the matter with the boy all this day he has got into such a rhodomontade manner all this morning  LEONTINE  But Sir I that have so large a part in the benefit is it not my duty to shew my joy is the being admitted to your favour so slight an obligation is the happiness of marrying my Olivia so small a blessing  CROAKER  Marrying Olivia marrying Olivia marrying his own sister Sure the boy is out of his senses His own sister  LEONTINE  My sister  OLIVIA  Sister How have I been mistaken  Aside  LEONTINE  Some curs'd mistake in all this I find  Aside  CROAKER  What does the booby mean or has he any meaning Eh what do you mean you blockhead you  LEONTINE  Mean Sirwhy Sironly when my sister is to be married that I have the pleasure of marrying her Sir that is of giving her away SirI have made a point of it  CROAKER  O is that all Give her away You have made a point of it Then yon had as good make a point of first giving away yourself as I'm going to prepare the writings between you and Miss Richland this very minute What a fuss is here about nothing Why what's the matter now I thought I had made you at least as happy as you could wish  OLIVIA  O yes Sir very happy  CROAKER  Do you foresee any thing child You look as if you did I think if any thing was to be foreseen I have as sharp a look out as another and yet I foresee nothing  Exit  LEONTINE OLIVIA  OLIVIA  What can it mean  LEONTINE  He knows something and yet for my life I can't tell what  OLIVIA  It can't be the connection between us I'm pretty certain  LEONTINE  Whatever it be my dearest I'm resolved to put it out of fortune's power to repeat our mortification I'll haste and prepare for our journey to Scotland this very evening My friend Honeywood has promised me his advice and assistance I'll go to him and repose our distresses on his friendly bosom and I know so much of his honest heart that if he can't relieve our uneasiness he will at least share them  Exeunt  ACT THE THIRD  SCENE Young HONEYWOOD'S House  BAILIFF HONEYWOOD FOLLOWER  BAILIFF  LOOKEY Sir I have arrested as good men as you in my time no disparagement of you neither Men that would go forty guineas on a game of cribbage I challenge the town to shew a man in more genteeler practice than myself  HONEYWOOD  Without all question Mr I forget your name Sir  BAILIFF  How can you forget what you never knew he he he  HONEYWOOD  May I beg leave to ask your name  BAILIFF  Yes you may  HONEYWOOD  Then pray Sir what is your name Sir  BAILIFF  That I didn't promise to tell you He he he A joke breaks no bones as we say among us that practise the law  HONEYWOOD  You may have reason for keeping it a secret perhaps  BAILIFF  The law does nothing without reason I'm asham'd to tell my name to no man Sir If you can shew cause as why upon a special capus that I should prove my nameBut come Timothy Twitch is my name And now you know my name what have you to say to that  HONEYWOOD  Nothing in the world good Mr Twitch but that I have a favour to ask that's all  BAILIFF  Ay favours are more easily asked than granted as we say among us that practise the law I have taken an oath against granting favours Would you have me perjure myself  HONEYWOOD  But my request will come recommended in so strong a manner as I believe you'll have no scruple  pulling out his purse  The thing is only this I believe I shall be able to discharge this trifle in two or three days at farthest but as I would not have the affair known for the world I have thoughts of  keeping you and your good friend here about me till the debt is discharged for which I shall be properly grateful  BAILIFF  Oh that's another maxum and altogether within my oath For certain if an honest man is to get any thing by a thing there's no reason why all things should not be done in civility  HONEYWOOD  Doubtless all trades must live Mr Twitch and yours is a necessary one  Gives him money  BAILIFF  Oh your honour I hope your honour takes nothing amiss as I does as I does nothing but my duty in so doing I'm sure no man can say I ever give a gentleman that was a gentleman ill usage If I saw that a gentleman was a gentleman I have taken money not to see him for ten weeks together  HONEYWOOD  Tenderness is a virtue Mr Twitch  BAILIFF  Ay Sir it's a perfect treasure I love to see a gentleman with a tender heart I don't know but I think I have a tender heart myself If all that I have lost by my heart was put together it would make abut no matter for that  HONEYWOOD  Don't account it lost Mr Twitch The Ingratitude of the world can never deprive us of the conscious  happiness of having acted with humanity ourselves  BAILIFF  Humanity Sir is a jewel It's better than gold I love humanity People may say that we in our way have no humanity but I'll shew yon my humanity this moment There's my follower here little Flanigan with a wife and four children a guinea or two would be more to him than twice as much to another Now as I can't shew him any humanity myself I must beg leave you'll do it for me  HONEYWOOD  I assure you Mr Twitch yours is a most powerful recommendation  Giving money to the follower  BAILIFF  Sir you're a gentleman I see you know what to do with your money But to business we are to be with you here as your friends I suppose But set in case company comesLittle Flanigan here to be sure has a good face a very good face but then he is a little seedy as we say among us that practise the law Not well in cloaths Smoke the pocketholes  HONEYWOOD  Well that shall be remedied without delay  Enter SERVANT  SERVANT  Sir Miss Richland is below  HONEYWOOD  How unlucky Detain her a moment We must improve my good friend little Mr Flanigan's appearance first Here let Mr Flanigan have a suit of my cloathsquickthe brown and silverDo you hear  SERVANT  That your honour gave away to the begging gentleman that makes verses because it was as good as new  HONEYWOOD  The white and gold then  SERVANT  That your honour I made bold to sell because it was good for nothing  HONEYWOOD  Well the first that comes to hand then The blue and gold then I believe Mr Flanigan will look best in blue  Exit  Flanigan  BAILIFF  Rabbit me but little Flanigan will look well in any thing Ah if your honour knew that bit of flesh as well as I do you'd be perfectly in love with him There's not a prettier scout in the four counties after a shycock than he scents like a hound sticks like a weazle He was master of the ceremonies  to the black queen of Morocco when I took him to follow me  Reenter  Flanigan    Heh ecod I think he looks so well that I don't care if I have a suit from the same place for myself  HONEYWOOD  Well well I hear the lady coming Dear Mr Twitch I beg you'll give your friend directions not to speak As for yourself I know you will say nothing without being directed  BAILIFF  Never you fear me I'll shew the lady that I have something to say for myself as well as another One man has one way of talking and another man has another that's all the difference between them  Enter Miss RICHLAND and her MAID  Miss RICHLAND  You'll be surpriz'd Sir with this visit But you know I'm yet to thank you for chusing my little library  HONEYWOOD  Thanks madam are unnecessary as it was I that was obliged by your commands Chairs here Two of my very Good friends Mr Twitch and Mr Flanigan Pray gentlemen sit without ceremony  Miss RICHLAND  Who can these oddlooking men be I fear it is as I was informed It must be so  Aside  BAILIFF after a Pause  Pretty weather very pretty weather for the time of the year madam  FOLLOWER  Very good circuit weather in the country  HONEYWOOD  You officers are generally favourites among the ladies My friends madam have been upon very disagreeable duty I assure you The fair should in some measure recompence the toils of the brave  Miss RICHLAND  Our officers do indeed deserve every favour The gentlemen are in the marine service I presume Sir  HONEYWOOD  Why madam they dooccasionally serve in the fleet madam A dangerous service  Miss RICHLAND  I'm told so And I own it has often surprized me that while we have had so many instances of bravery there we have had so few of wit at home to praise it  HONEYWOOD  I grant madam that our poets have not written as our soldiers have fought but they have done all they could and Hawke or Amherst could do do more  Miss RICHLAND  I'm quite displeased when I see a fine subject spolied by a dull writer  HONEYWOOD  We should not be so severe against dull writers madam It is ten to one but the dullest writer exceeds the most rigid French critic who presumes to despise him  FOLLOWER  Damn the French the parle vous and all that belongs to them  Miss RICHLAND  Sir  HONEYWOOOD  Ha ha ha honest Mr Flanigan A true English officer madam he's not contented with beating the French but he will scold them too  Miss RICHLAND  Yet Mr Honeywood this does not convince me but that severity in criticism is necessary It was our first adopting the severity of French taste that has brought them in turn to taste us  BAILIFF  Taste us By the Lord madam they devour us Give monseers but a taste and I'll be damn'd but they come in for a bellyful  Miss RICHLAND  Very extraordinary this  FOLLOWER  But very true What makes the bread rising the parle vous that devour us What makes the mutton fivepence a pound the parle vous that eat  it up What makes the beer threepencehalfpenny a pot  HONEYWOOD  Ah the vulgar rogues all will be out  Aside  Right gentlemen very right upon my word and quite to the purpose They draw a parallel madam between the mental taste and that of our senses We are injured as much by French severity in the one as by French rapacity in the other That's their meaning  Miss RICHLAND  Though I don't see the force of the parallel yet I'll own that we should sometimes pardon books as we do our friends that have now and then agreeable absurdities to recommend them  BAILIFF  That's all my eye The king only can pardon as the laws says for set in case  HONEYWOOD  I'm quite of your opinion Sir I see the whole drift of your argument Yes certainly our presuming to pardon any work is arrogating a power that belongs to a another If all have power to condemn what writer can be free  BRILIFF  By his habus corpus His habus corpus can set him free at any time for set in case  HONEYWOOD  I'm obliged to you Sir for the hint If madam as my friend observes our laws are so careful  of a gentleman's person sure we ought to be equally careful of his dearer part his fame  FOLLOWER  Ay but if so be a man's nabb'd you know  HONEYWOOD  Mr Flanigan if you spoke for ever you could not improve the last observation For my own part I think it conclusive  BAILIFF  As for the matter of that mayhap  HONEYWOOD  Nay Sir give me leave in this instance to be positive For where is the necessity of censuring works without genius which must shortly sink of themselves what is it but aiming our unnecessary blow against a victim already under the hands of justice  BAILIFF  Justice O by the elevens if you talk about justice I think I am at home there for in a course of law  HONEYWOOD  My dear Mr Twitch I discern what you'd be at perfectly and I believe the lady must be sensible of the art with which it is introduced I suppose you perceive the meaning madam of his course of law  Miss RICHLAND  I protest Sir I do not I perceive only that you answer one gentleman before he has finished and the other before he has well begun  BAILIFF  Madam you are a gentlewoman and I will make the matter out This here question is about severity and justice and pardon and the like of they Now to explain the thing  HONEYWOOD  O curse your explanations  Aside  Enter SERVANT  SERVANT  Mr Leontine Sir below desires to speak with you upon earnest business  HONEYWOOD  That's lucky  Aside  Dear madam you'll excuse me and my good friends here for a few minutes There are books madam to amuse you Come gentlemen you know I make no ceremony with such friends After you Sir Excuse me Well if I must But I know your natural politeness  BAILIFF  Before and behind you know  FOLLOWER  Ay ay before and behind before and behind  Exeunt  Honeywood    Bailiff  and  Follower  Miss RICHLAND  What can all this mean Garnet  GARNET  Mean madam why what should it mean but what Mr Lofty sent you here to see These people  he calls officers are officers sure enough sheriff's officers bailiffs madam  Miss RICHLAND  Ay it is certainly so Well though his perplexities are far from giving me pleasure yet I own there's something very ridiculous in them and a just punishment for his dissimulation  GARNET  And so they are But I wonder madam that the lawyer you just employed to pay his debts and set him free has not done it by this time He ought at least to have been here before now But lawyers are always more ready to get a man into troubles than out of them  Enter Sir WILLIAM  Sir WILLIAM  For Miss Richland to undertake setting him free I own was quite unexpected It has totally unhinged my schemes to reclaim him Yet it gives me pleasure to find that among a number of worthless friendships he has made one acquisition of real value for there must be some softer passion on her side that prompts this generosity Ha here before me I'll endeavour to sound her affections Madam as I am the person that have had some demands upon the gentleman of this house I hope you'll excuse me if before I enlarged him I wanted to see yourself  Miss RICHLAND  The precaution was very unnecessary Sir I suppose your wants were only such as my agent had power to satisfy  Sir WILLIAM  Partly madam But I was also willing you should be fully apprized of the character of the gentleman you intended to serve  Miss RICHLAND  It must come sir with a very ill grace from you To censure it after what you have done would look like malice and to speak favourably of a character you have oppressed would be impeaching your own And sure his tenderness his humanity his universal friendship may atone for many faults  Sir WILLIAM  That friendship madam which is exerted in too wide a sphere becomes totally useless Our bounty like a drop of water disappears when diffused too widely They who pretend most to this universal benevolence are either deceivers or dupes Men who desire to cover their private illnature by a pretended regard for all or men who reasoning themselves into false feelings are more earnest in pursuit of splendid than of useful virtues  Miss RICHLAND  I am surprised Sir to hear one who has probably been a gainer by the folly of others so severe in his censure of it  Sir WILLIAM  Whatever I may have gained by folly madam you see I am willing to prevent your losing by it  Miss RICHLAND  You cares for me Sir are unnecessary I always suspect those services which are denied where they are wanted and offered perhaps in hopes of a refusal No Sir my directions have been given and I insist upon their being complied with  Sir WILLIAM  Thou amiable woman I can no longer contain the expressions of my gratitude my pleasure You see before you one who has been equally careful of his interest one who has for some time been a concealed spectator of his follies and only punished in hopes to reclaim themhis uncle  Miss RICHLAND  Sir William Honeywood You amaze me How shall I conceal my confusion I fear Sir you'll think I have been too forward in my services I confess I  Sir WILLIAM  Don't make any apologies madam I only find myself unable to repay the obligation And yet I have been trying my interest of late to serve you Having learnt madam that you had some demands upon government I have though unasked been your solicitor there  Miss RICHLAND  Sir I'm infinitely obliged to your intentions But my guardian has employed another gentleman who assures him of success  Sir WILLIAM  Who the important little man that visits here Trust me madam he's quite contemptible among men in power and utterly unable to serve you Mr Lofty's promises are much better known to people of fashion than his person I assure you  Miss RICHLAND  How have we been deceived As sure as can be here he comes  Sir WILLIAM  Does he Remember I'm to continue unknown My return to England has not as yet been made public With what impudence he enters  Enter LOFTY  LOFTY  Let the chariotlet my chariot drive off I'll visit to his grace's in a chair Miss Richland here before me Punctual as usual to the calls of humanity I'm very sorry madam things of this kind should happen especially to a man I have shewn every where and carried amongst us as a particular acquaintance  Miss RICHLAND  I find Sir you have the art of making the misfortunes of others your own  LOFTY  My dear madam what can a private man like me do One man can't do every thing and then I do so much in this way every day let me see something considerable might be done for him by subscription it could not fail if I carried the list I'll undertake to set down a brace of dukes two dozen lords and half the lower house at my own peril  Sir WILLIAM  And after all it's more than probable Sir he might reject the offer of such powerful patronage  LOFTY  Then madam what can we do You know I never make promises In truth I once or twice tried to do something with him in the way of business but as I often told his uncle Sir William Honeywood the man was utterly impracticable  Sir WILLIAM  His uncle Then that gentleman I suppose is a particular friend of yours  LOFTY  Meaning me SirYes madam as I often said my dear Sir William you are sensible I would do any thing as far as my poor interest goes to serve your family but what can be done there's no procuring firstrate places for ninthrate abilities  Miss RICHLAND  I have heard of Sir William Honeywood he's abroad in employment he confided in your judgment I suppose  LOFTY  Why yes madam I believe Sir William had some reason to confide in my Judgment one little reason perhaps  Miss RICHLAND  Pray Sir What was it  LOFTY  Why madambut let it go no furtherit was I procured him his place  Sir WILLIAM  Did you Sir  LOFTY  Either you or I Sir  Miss RICHLAND  This Mr Lofty was very kind indeed  LOFTY  I did love him to be sure he had some amusing qualities no man was fitter to be toastmaster to a club or had a better head  Miss RICHLAND  A better head  LOFTY  Ay at a bottle To be sure he was as dull as a choice spirit but hand it he was grateful very grateful and gratitude hides a multitude of faults  Sir WILLIAM  He might have reason perhaps His place is pretty considerable I'm told  LOFTY  A trifle a mere trifle among us men of business The truth is he wanted dignity to fill up a greater  Sir WILLIAM  Dignity of person do you mean Sir I'm told he's much about my size and figure Sir  LOFTY  Ay tall enough for a marching regiment but then he wanted a somethinga consequence of forma kind of aI believe the lady perceives my meaning  Miss RICHLAND  O perfectly you courtiers can do any thing I see  LOFTY  My dear madam all this is but a meer exchange we do greater things for one another every day Why as thus now let me suppose you the first lord of the treasury you have an employment in you that I want I have a place in me that you want do me here do you there interest of both sides few words flat done and done and its over  Sir WILLIAM  A thought strikes me  Aside  Now you mention Sir William Honeywood madam and as he seems Sir an acquaintance of yours you'll be glad to hear he's arrived from Italy I had it from a friend  who knows him as well as he does me and you may depend on my information  LOFTY  The devil he is If I had known that we should not have been quite so well acquainted  Aside  Sir WILLIAM  He is certainly return'd and as this gentleman is a friend of yours he can be of signal service to us by introducing me to him there are some papers relative to your affairs that require dispatch and his inspection  Miss RICHLAND  This gentleman Mr Lofty is a person employed in my affairs I know you'll serve us  LOFTY  My dear madam I live but to serve you Sir William shall even wait upon him if you think proper to command it  Sir WILLIAM  That would be quite unnecessary  LOFTY  Well we must introduce you then Call upon melet me seeay in two days  Sir WILLIAM  Now or the opportunity will be lost for ever  LOFTY  Well if it must be now now let it be But damn it that's unfortunate my lord Grig's cursed Pensacola  business comes on this very hour and I'm engaged to attendanother time  Sir WILLIAM  A short letter to Sir William will do  LOFTY  You shall have it yet in my opinion a letter is a very bad way of going to work face to face that's my way  Sir WILLIAM  The letter Sir will do quite as well  LOFTY  Zounds Sir do you pretend to direct me direct me in the business of office Do you know me Sir who am I  Miss RICHLAND  Dear Mr Lofty this request is not so much his as mine if my commandsbut you despise my power  LOFTY  Delicate creature your commands could even controul a debate at midnight to a power so constitutional I am all obedience and tranquility He shall have a letter where is my secretary Dubardieu And yet I protest I don't like this way of doing business I think if I spoke first to Sir WilliamBut you will have it so  Exit with Miss  Richland  Sir WILLIAM alone  Ha ha ha This too is one of my nephew's hopefull associates O vanity thou constant deceiver  how do all thy efforts to exalt serve but to sink us Thy false colourings like those employed to heighten beauty only seem to mend that bloom which they contribute to destroy I'm not displeased at this interview exposing this fellow's impudence to the contempt it deserves may be of use to my design at least if he can reflect it will be of use to himself  Enter JARVIS  Sir WILLIAM  How now Jarvis where's your master my nephew  JARVIS  At his wit's end I believe he's scarce gotten out of one scrape but he's running his head into another  Sir WILLIAM  How so  JARVIS  The house has but just been cleared of the bailiffs and now he's again engaging tooth and nail in assisting old Croaker's son to patch up a clandestine match with the young lady that passes in the house for his sister  Sir WILLIAM  Ever busy to serve others  JARVIS  Aye any body but himself The young couple it seems are just setting out for Scotland and he supplies them with money for the Journey  Sir WILLIAM  Money how is he able to supply others who has scarce any for himself  JARVIS  Why there it is he has no money that's true but then as he never said no to any request in his life he has given them a bill drawn by a friend of his upon a merchant in the city which I am to get changed for you must know that I am to go with them to Scotland myself  Sir WILLIAM  How  JARVIS  It seems the young gentleman is obliged to take a different road from his mistress as he is to call upon an uncle of his that lives out of the way in order to prepare a place fore their reception when they return so they have borrowed me from my master as the properest person to attend the young lady down  Sir WILLIAM  To the land of matrimony A pleasant journey Jarvis  JARVIS  Ay but I'm only to have all the fatigues on't  Sir WILLIAM  Well it may be shorter and less fatiguing than you imagine I know but too much of the young lady's family and connections whom I have seen abroad I have also discovered that Miss Richland is not indifferent to my thoughtless nephew and will endeavour thought I fear in vain to establish that connection But come the litter I wait for muft be almost finished I'll let you further into my intentions in the next room  Exeunt  ACT THE FOURTH  SCENE CROAKER'S House  LOFTY  WELL sure the devil's in me of late for running my head into such defiles as nothing but a genius like my own could draw me from I was formerly contented to husband out my places and pensions with some degree of frugality but curse it of late I have given away the whole Court Register in less time than they could print the title page yet hang it why scruple a lie or two to come at a fine girl when I every day tell a thousand for nothing Ha Honeywood here before me Could Miss Richland have set him at liberty  Enter HONEYWOOD  Mr Honeywood I'm glad to see you abroad again I find my concurrence was not necessary in your unfortunate affairs I had put things in a train to do your business but it is not for me to say what I intended doing  HONEYWOOD  It was unfortunate indeed Sir But what adds to my uneasiness is that while you seem to be acquainted with my misfortune I myself continue still a stranger to my benefactor  LOFTY  How not know the friend that served you  HONEYWOOD  Can't guess at the person  LOFTY  Inquire  HONEYWOOD  I have but all I can learn is that he chuses to remain concealed and that all inquiry must be fruitless  LOFTY  Must be fruitless  HONEYWOOD  Absolutely fruitless  LOFTY  Sure of that  HONEYWOOD  Very sure  LOFTY  Then I'll be damn'd if you shall ever know it from me  HONEYWOOD  How Sir  LOFTY  I suppose now Mr Honeywood you think my rentroll very considerable and that I have vast sums of money to throw away I know you do The world to be sure says such things of me  HONEYWOOD  The world by what I learn is no stranger to your generosity But where does this tend  LOFTY  To nothing nothing in the world The town to be sure when it makes such a thing as me the subject of conversation has asserted that I never yet patronized a man of merit  HONEYWOOD  I have heard instances to the contrary even from yourself  LOFTY  Yes Honeywood and there are instances to the contrary that you shall never hear from myself  HONEYWOOD  Ha dear Sir permit me to ask you but one question  LOFTY  Sir ask me no questions I say Sir ask me no questions I'll be damn'd if I answer them  HONEYWOOD  I will ask no further My friend my benefactor it is it must be here that I am indebted for freedom for honour Yes thou worthiest of men  from the beginning I suspected it but was afraid to return thanks which if undeserved might seem reproaches  LOFTY  I protest I don't understand all this Mr Honeywood You treat me very cavalierly I do assure you SirBlood Sir can't a man be permitted to enjoy the luxury of his own feelings without all this parade  HONEYWOOD  Nay do not attempt to conceal an action that adds to your honour Your looks your air your manner all confess it  LOFTY  Confess it Sir Torture itself Sir shall never bring me to confess it Mr Honeywood I have admitted you upon terms of friendship Don't let us fall out make me happy and let this be buried in oblivion You know I hate ostentation you know I do Come come Honeywood you know I always loved to be a friend and not a patron I beg this may make no kind of distance between us Come come you and I must be more familiarIndeed we must  HONEYWOOD  Heavens Can I ever repay such friendship Is there any way Thou best of men can I ever return the obligation  LOFTY  A bagatelle a mere bagatelle But I see your heart is labouring to be grateful You shall be grateful It would be cruel to disappoint you  HONEYWOOD  How teach me the manner Is there any way  LOFTY  From this moment you're mine yes my friend you shall know itI'm in love  HONEYWOOD  And can I assist you  LOFTY  Nobody so well  HONEYWOOD  In what manner I'm all impatience  LOFTY  You shall make love for me  HONEYWOOD  And to whom shall I speak in your favour  LOFTY  To a lady with whom you have great interest I assure you Miss Richland  HONEYWOOD  Miss Richland  LOFTY  Yes Miss Richland She has struck the blow un to the hilt in my bosom by Jupiter  HONEYWOOD  Heavens was ever any thing more unfortunate It is too much to be endured  LOFTY  Unfortunate indeed And yet I can endure it till you have opened the affair to her for me Between ourselves I think she likes me I'm not apt to boast but I think she does  HONEYWOOD  Indeed But do you know the person you apply to  LOFTY  Yes I know you are her friend and mine that's enough To you therefore I commit the success of my paffion I'll say no more let friendship do the rest I have only to add that if at any time my little interest can be of servicebut hang it I'll make no promisesyou know my interest is yours at any time No apologies my friend I'll not be answered it shall be so  Exit  HONEYWOOD  Open generous unsuspecting man He little thinks that I love her too and with such an ardent passionBut then it was ever but a vain and hopeless one my torment my persecution What shall I do Love friendship an hopeless passion a deserving friend Love that has been my tormentor a friend that has perhaps distressed himself to serve me It shall be so Yes I will discard the fondling hope from my bosom and exert all my  influence in his favour And yet to see her in the possession of anotherInsupportable But then to betray a generous trusting friendWorse worse Yes I'm resolved Let me but be the instrument of their happiness and then quit a country where I must for ever despair of finding my own  Exit  Enter OLIVIA and GARNET who carries a Milliner's Box  OLIVIA  Dear me I wish this journey were over No news of Jarvis yet I believe the old peevish creature delays purely to vex me  GARNET  Why to be sure madam I did hear him say a little snubbing before marriage would teach you to bear it the better afterwards  OLIVIA  To be gone a full hour though he had only to get a bill changed in the city How provoking  GARNET  I'll lay my life Mr Leontine that had twice as much to do is setting off by this time from his inn and here you are left behind  OLIVIA  Well let us be prepared for his coming however Are you sure you have omitted nothing Garnet  GARNET  Not a stick madamall's here Yet I wish you could take the white and silver to be married in It's the worst luck in the world in any thing but white I knew one Bett Stubbs of our town that was married in red and as sure as eggs is eggs the bridegroom and she had a miff before morning  OLIVIA  No matter I'm all impatience till we are out of the house  GARNET  Bless me madam I had almost forgot the weddingringThe sweet little thingI don't think it would go on my little finger And what if I put in a gentleman's nightcap in case of necessity madam But here's Jarvis  Enter JARVIS  OLIVIA  O Jarvis are you come at last We have been ready this half hour Now let's be going Let us fly  JARVIS  Aye to Jericho for we shall have no going to Scotland this bout I fancy  OLIVIA  How What's the matter  JARVIS  Money money is the matter madam We have got no money What the plague do you send me  of your fool's errand for My master's bill upon the city is not worth a rush Here it is Mrs Garnet may pin up her hair with it  OLIVIA  Undone How could Honeywood serve us so What shall we do Can't we go without it  JARVIS  Go to Scotland without money To Scotland without money Lord how some people understand geography We might as well set sail for Patagonia upon a cork jacket  OLIVIA  Such a disappointment What a base insincere man was your master to serve us in this manner Is this his good nature  JARVIS  Nay don't talk ill of my master madam I won't bear to hear any body talk ill of him but myself  GARNET  Bless us now I think on't madam you need not be under any uneasiness I saw Mr Leontine receive forty guineas from his father just before he set out and he can't yet have left the inn A short letter will reach him there  OLIVIA  Well remember'd Garnet I'll write immediately How's this Bless me my hand trembles so I can't write a word Do you write Garnet and upon second thought it will be better from you  GARNET  Truly madam I write and indite but poorly I never was kute at my larning But I'll do what I can to please you Let me see All out of my own head I suppose  OLIVIA  Whatever you please  GARNET  Writing  Muster CroakerTwenty guineas madam  OLIVIA  Aye twenty will do  GARNET  At the bar of the Talbot till call'd for ExpeditionWill be blown upAll of a flameQuick dispatchCupid the little god of loveI conclude it madam with Cupid I love to see a loveletter end like poetry  OLIVIA  Well well what you please any thing But how shall we send it I can trust none of the servants of this family  GARNET  Odso madam Mr Honeywood's butler is in the next room he's a dear sweet man he'll do any thing for me  JARVIS  He the dog he'll certainly commit some blunder He's drunk and sober ten times a day  OLIVIA  No matter Fly Garnet any body we can trust will do  Exit  Garnet    Well Jarvis now we can have nothing more to interrupt us You may take up the things and carry them on to the inn Have you no hands Jarvis  JARVIS  Soft and fair young lady You that are going to be married think things can never be done too fast but we that are old and know what we are about must elope methodically madam  OLIVIA  Well sure if my indiscretions were to be done over again  JARVIS  My life for it you would do them ten times over  OLIVIA  Why will you talk so If you knew how unhappy they make me  JARVIS  Very unhappy no doubt I was once just as unhappy when I was going to be married myself I'll tell you a story about that  OLIVIA  A story when I'm all impatience to be away Was there ever such a dilatory creature  JARVIS  Well madam if we must march why we will march that's all Though odds bobs we have  still forgot one thing we should never travel withouta case of good razors and a box of shavingpowder But no matter I believe we shall be pretty well shaved by the way  Going  Enter GARNET  GARNIST  Undone undone madam Ah Mr Jarvis you said right enough As sure as death Mr Honeywood's rogue of a drunken butler dropp'd the letter before he went ten yards from the door There's old Croaker has just pick'd it up and is this moment reading it to himself in the hall  OLIVIA  Unfortunate We shall be discovered  GARNET  No madam don't be uneasy he can make neither head nor tail of it To be sure he looks as if he was broke loose from Bedlam about it but he can't find what it means for all that O lud he is coming this way all in the horrors  OLIVIA  Then let us leave the house this instant for fear he should ask farther questions In the mean time Garnet do you write and send off just such another  Exeunt  Enter CROAKER  CROAKER  Death and destruction Are all the horrors of air fire and water to be levelled only at me Am I only to be singled out for gunpowderplots combustibles and conflagration Here it isAn incendiary letter dropped at my door "To muster Croaker these with speed" Aye aye plain enough the direction all in the genuine incendiary spelling and as cramp as the devil "With speed" O confound your speed But let me read it once more  Reads  "Muster Croaker as sone as yoew see this leve twenty guineas at the bar of the Talboot tell called for or yowe and yower experetion will be al blown up" Ah but too plain Blood and gunpowder in every line of it Blown up murderous dog All blown up Heavens what have I and my poor family done to be all blown up  Reads  "Our pockets are low and money we must have" Aye there's the reason they'll blow us up because they have got low pockets  Reads  "It is but a short time you have to confider for if this takes wind the house will quickly be all of a flame" Inhuman monsters blow us up and then burn us The earthquake at Lisbon was but a bonfire to it  Reads  "Make quick dispatch and so no more at present But may Cupid the little god of love go with you wherever you go" The little god of love Cupid the little god of  love go with me Go you to the devil you and your little Cupid together I'm so frightened I scarce knew whether I fit stand or go Perhaps this moment I'm treading on lighted matches blazing brimstone and barrels of gunpowder They are preparing to blow me up into the clouds Murder We shall be all burnt in our beds we shall be all burnt in our beds  Enter Miss RICHLAND  Miss RICHLAND  Lord Sir what's the matter  CROAKER  Murder's the matter We shall be all blown up in our beds before morning  Miss RICHLAND  I hope not Sir  CROAKER  What signifies what you hope madam when I have a certificate of it here in my hand Will nothing alarm my family Sleeping and eating sleeping and eating is the only work from morning till night in my house My insensible crew could sleep though rock'd by an earthquake and fry beef steaks at a volcano  Miss RICHLAND  But Sir you have alarmed them so often already we have nothing but earthquakes famines plagues and mad dogs from year's end to year's end You  remember Sir it is not above a month ago you assured us of a conspiracy among the bakers to poison us in our bread and so kept the whole family a week upon potatoes  CROAKER  And potatoes were too good for them But why do I stand talking here with a girl when I should be facing the enemy without Here John Nicodemus search the house Look into the cellars to see if there be any combustibles below and above in the apartments that no matches be thrown in at the windows Let all the fires be put out and let the engine be drawn out in the yard to play upon the house in case of necessity  Exit  Miss RICHLAND alone  What can he mean by all this Yet why should I inquire when he alarms us in this manner almost every day But Honeywood has desired an interview with me in private What can he mean or rather what means this palpitation at his approach It is the first time he ever shewed any thing in his conduct that seemed particular Sure he cannot mean tobut he's here  Enter HONEYWOOD  HONEYWOOD  I presumed to solicit this interview madam before I left town to be permitted  Miss RICHLAND  Indeed Leaving town Sir  HONEYWOOD  Yes madam perhaps the kingdom I have presumed I say to desire the favour of this interviewin order to disclose something which our long friendship prompts And yet my fears  Miss RICHLAND  His fears What are his fears to mine  Aside  We have indeed been long acquainted Sir very long If I remember our first meeting was at the French ambassador'sDo you recollect how you were pleased to rally me upon my complexion there  HONEYWOOD  Perfectly madam I presumed to reprove you for painting but your warmer blushes soon convinced the company that the colouring was all from nature  Miss RICHLAND  And yet you only meant it in your goodnatured way to make me pay a compliment to myself In the same manner you danced that night with the most aukward woman in company because you saw nobody else would take her out  HONEYWOOD  Yes and was rewarded the next night by dancing with the finest woman in company whom every body wished to take out  Miss RICHLAND  Well Sir if you thought so then I fear your judgment has since corrected the errors of a first impression We generally shew to most advantage at first Our sex are like poor tradesmen that put all their best goods to be seen at the windows  HONEYWOOD  The first impression madam did indeed deceive me I expected to find a woman with all the faults of conscious flattered beauty I expected to find her vain and insolent But every day has since taught me that it is possible to possess sense without pride and beauty without affectation  Miss RICHLAND  This Sir is a style very unusual with Mr Honeywood and I should be glad to know why he thus attempts to encrease that vanity which his own lessons have taught me to despise  HONEYWOOD  I ask pardon madam Yet from our long friendship I presumed I might have some right to offer without offence what you may refuse without offending  Miss RICHLAND  Sir I beg you'd reflect though I fear I shall scarce have any power to refuse a request of yours yet you may be precipitate consider Sir  HONEYWOOD  I own my rashness but as I plead the cause of friendship of one who lovesDon't be alarmed  madamwho loves you with the most ardent passion whose whole happiness is placed in you  Miss RICHLAND  I fear Sir I shall never find whom you mean by this description of him  HONEYWOOD  Ah madam it but too plainly points him out though he should be too humble himself to urge his pretensions or you too modest to understand them  Miss RICHLAND  Well it would be affectation any longer to pretend ignorance and I will own Sir I have long been prejudiced in his favour It was but natural to wish to make his heart mine as he seemed himself ignorant of its value  HONEYWOOD  I see she always loved him  Aside  I find madam you're already sensible of his worth his passion How happy is my friend to be the favourite of one with such sense to distinguish merit and such beauty to reward it  Miss RICHLAND  Your friend Sir What friend  HONEYWOOD  My best friendmy friend Mr Lofty madam  Miss RICHLAND  He Sir  HONEYWOOD  Yes he madam He is indeed what your warmest wishes might have formed him And to  his other qualities he adds that of the most passionate regard for you  Miss RICHLAND  AmazementNo more of this I beg you Sir  HONEYWOOD  I see your confusion madam and know how to interpret it And since I so plainly read the language of your heart shall I make my friend happy by communicating your sentiments  Miss RICHLAND  By no means  HONEYWOOD  Excuse me I must I know you desire it  Miss RICHLAND  Mr Honeywood let me tell you that you wrong my sentiments and yourself When I first applied to your friendship I expected advice and assistance but now Sir I see that it is vain to expect happiness from him who has been so bad an oeconomist of his own and that I must disclaim his friendship who ceases to be a friend to himself  Exit  HONEYWOOD  How is this she has confessed she loved him and yet she seemed to part in displeasure Can I have done any thing to reproach myself with No I believe not yet after all these things should not be done by a third person I should have spared her confusion My friendship carried me a little too far  Enter CROAKER with the Letter in his Hand and Mrs CROAKER  Mrs CROAKER  Ha ha ha And so my dear it's your supreme wish that I should be quite wretched upon this occasion ha ha  CROAKER mimicking  Ha ha ha And so my dear it's your supreme pleasure to give me no better consolation  Mrs CROAKER  Positively my dear what is this incendiary stuff and trumpery to me our house may travel through the air like the house of Loretto for aught I care if I'm to be miserable in it  CROAKER  Would to heaven it were converted into an house of correction for your benefit Have we not every thing to alarm us Perhaps this very moment the tragedy is beginning  Mrs CROAKER  Then let us reserve our distress till the rising of the curtain or give them the money they want and have done with them  CROAKER  Give them my moneyAnd pray what right have they to my money  Mrs CROAKER  And pray what right then have you to my good humour  CROAKER  And so your good humour advises me to part with my money Why then to tell your good humour a piece of my mind I'd sooner part with my wife Here's Mr Honeywood see what he'll say to it My dear Honeywood look at this incendiary letter dropped at my door It will freeze you with terror and yet lovey here can read itcan read it and laugh  Mrs CROAKER  Yes and so will Mr Honeywood  CROAKER  If he does I'll suffer to be hanged the next minute in the rogue's place that's all  Mrs CROAKER  Speak Mr Honeywood is there any thing more foolish than my husband's fright upon this occasion  HONEYWOOD  It would not become me to decide madam but doubtless the greatness of his terrors now will but invite them to renew their villainy another time  Mrs CROAKER  I told you he'd be of my opinion  CROAKER  How Sir do you maintain that I should lie down under such an injury and shew neither by my tears or complaints that I have something of the spirit of a man in me  HONEYWOOD  Pardon me Sir You ought to make the loudest complaints if you desire redress The surest way to have redress is to be earnest in the pursuit of it  CROAKER  Aye whose opinion is he of now  Mrs CROAKER  But don't you think that laughing off our fears is the best way  HONEYWOOD  What is the best madam few can say but I'll maintain it to be a very wise way  CROAKER  But we're talking of the best Surely the best way is to face the enemy in the field and not wait till he plunders us in our very bedchamber  HONEYWOOD  Why Sir as to the best thatthat's a very wise way too  Mrs CROAKER  But can any thing be more absurd than to double our distresses by our apprehensions and put it in the power of every low fellow that can scrawl ten words of wretched spelling to torment us  HONEYWOOD  Without doubt nothing more absurd  CROAKER  How would it not be more absurd to despise the rattle till we are bit by the snake  HONEYWOOD  Without doubt perfectly absurd  CROAKER  Then you are of my opinion  HONEYWOOD  Entirely  Mrs CROAKER  And you reject mine  HONEYWOOD  Heavens forbid madam No sure no reasoning can be more just than yours We ought' certainly to despise malice if we cannot oppose it and not make the incendiary's pen as fatal to our repose as the highwayman's pistol  Mrs CROAKER  O then you think I'm quite right  HONEYWOOD  Perfectly right  CROAKER  A plague of plagues we can't be both right I ought to be sorry or I ought to be glad My hat must be on my head or my hat must be off  Mrs CROAKER  Certainly in two opposite opinions if one be perfectly reasonable the other can't be perfectly right  HONEYWOOD  And why may not both be right madam Mr Croaker in earnestly seeking redress and you in waiting the event with good humour Pray let me  see the letter again I have it This letter requires twenty guineas to be left at the bar of the Talbot inn If it be indeed an incendiary letter what if you and I Sir go there and when the writer comes to be paid his expected booty seize him  CROAKER  My dear friend it's the very thing the very thing While I walk by the door you shall plant yourself in ambush near the bar burst out upon the miscreant like a masqued battery extort a confession at once and so hang him up by surprise  HONEYWOOD  Yes but I would not chuse to exercise too much severity It is my maxim Sir that crimes generally punish themselves  CROAKER  Well but we may upbraid him a little I suppose  Ironically  HONEYWOOD  Aye but not punish him too rigidly  CROAKER  Well well leave that to my own benevolence  HONEYWOOD  Well I do but remember that universal benevolence is the first law of nature  Exeunt  Honeywood  and Mrs  Croaker  CROAKER  Yes and my universal benevolence will hang the dog if he had as many necks as a hydra  ACT THE FIFTH  SCENE an Inn  Enter OLIVIA JARVIS  OLIVIA  WELL we have got safe to the Inn however Now if the postchaise were ready  JARVIS  The horses are just finishing their oats and as they are not going to be married they choose to take their own time  OLIVIA  You are for ever giving wrong motives to my impatience  JARVIS  Be as impatient as you will the horses must take their own time besides you don't consider we have got no answer from our fellowtraveller yet If we hear nothing from Mr Leontine we have only one way left us  OLIVIA  What way  JARVIS  The way home again  OLIVIA  Not so I have made a resolution to go and nothing shall induce me to break it  JARVIS  Aye resolutions are well kept when they jump with inclination However I'll go hasten things without And I'll call too at the bar to see if any thing should be left for us there Don't be in such a plaguy hurry madam and we shall go the faster I promise you  Exit  Jarvis  Enter LANDLADY  LANDLADY  What Solomon why don't you move Pipes and tobacco for the Lamb thereWill nobody answer To the Dolphin quick The Angel has been outrageous this half hour Did your ladyship call madam  OLIVIA  No madam  LANDLADY  I find as you're for Scotland madamBut that's no business of mine married or not married I ask no questions To be sure we had a sweet little couple set off from this two days ago for the same place The gentleman for a taylor was to be sure as fine a spoken taylor as ever blew froth from a full  pot And the young lady so bashful it was near half an hour before we could get her to finish a pint of rasberry between us  OLIVIA  But this gentleman and I are not going to be married I assure you  LANDLADY  May be not That's no business of mine for certain Scotch marriages seldom turn out There was of my own knowledge Miss Macfag that married her father's footmanAlackaday she and her husband soon parted and now keep separate cellars in Hedgelane  OLIVIA  A very pretty picture of what lies before me  Aside  Enter LEONTINE  LEONTINE  My dear Olivia my anxiety till you were out of danger was too great to be resisted I could not help coming to see you set out though it exposes us to a discovery  OLIVIA  May every thing you do prove as fortunate Indeed Leontine we have been most cruelly disappointed Mr Honeywood's bill upon the city has it seems been protested and we have been utterly at a loss how to proceed  LEONTINE  How an offer of his own too Sure he could not mean to deceive us  OLIVIA  Depend upon his sincerity he only mistook the desire for the power of serving us But let us think no more of it I believe the postchaise is ready by this  LANDLADY  Not quite yet and begging your ladyship's pardon I don't think your ladyship quite ready for the postchaise The north road is a cold place madam I have a drop in the house of as pretty rasberry as ever was tipt over tongue Just a thimble full to keep the wind off your stomach To be sure the last couple we had here they said it was a perfect nosegay Ecod I sent them both away as good naturedUp went the blinds round went the wheels and drive away postboy was the word  Enter CROAKER  CROAKER  Well while my friend Honeywood is upon the post of danger at the bar it must be my business to have an eye about me here I think I know an incendiary's look for wherever the devil makes a purchase he never fails to set his mark Ha who have we here My son and daughter What can they be doing here  LANDLADY  I tell you madam it will do you good I think I know by this time what's good for the north road It's a raw night madamSir  LEONTINE  Not a drop more good madam I should now take it as a greater favour if you hasten the horses for I am afraid to be seen myself  LANDLADY  That shall be done Wha Solomon are you all dead there Wha Solomon I say  Exit bawling  OLIVIA  Well I dread lest an expedition begun in fear should end in repentanceEvery moment we stay increases our danger and adds to my apprehensions  LEONTINE  There's no danger trust me my dear there can be none if Honeywood has acted with honour and kept my father as he promised in employment till we are out of danger nothing can interrupt our journey  OLIVIA  I have no doubt of Mr Honeywood's sincerity and even his desires to serve us My fears are from your father's suspicions A mind so disposed to be alarmed without a cause will be but too ready when there's a reason  LEONTINE  Why let him when we are out of his power But believe me Olivia yon have no great reason to dread his resentment His repining temper as it does no manner of injury to himself so will it never do harm to others He only frets to keep himself employed and scolds for his private amusement  OLIVIA  I don't know that but I'm sure on some occasions it makes him look most shockingly  CROAKER discovering himself  How does he look nowHow does he look now  OLIVIA  Ah  LEONTINE  Undone  CROAKER  How do I look now Sir I am your very humble servant Madam I am yours What you are going off are you Then first if you please take a word or two from me with you before you go Tell me first where you are going and when you have told me that perhaps I shall know as little as I did before  LEONTINE  If that be so our answer might but increase your displeasure without adding to your information  CROAKER  I want no information from you puppy and you too good madam what answer have you got Eh  A cry without stop him  I think I heard a noise My friend Honeywood withouthas he seized the incendiary Ah no for now I hear no more on't  LEONTINE  Honeywood without Then Sir it was Mr Honeywood that directed you hither  CROAKER  No Sir it was Mr Honeywood conducted me hither  LEONTINE  Is it possible  CROAKER  Possible Why he's in the house now Sir more anxious about me than my own son Sir  LEONTINE  Then Sir he's a villain  CROAKER  How sirrah a villain because he takes most care of your father I'll not bear it I tell you I'll not bear it Honeywood is a friend to the family and I'll have him treated as such  LEONTINE  I shall study to repay his friendship as it deserves  CROAKER  Ah rogue if you knew how earnestly he entered into my griefs and pointed out the means to detect them you would love him as I do  A cry without stop him  Fire and fury they have seized the incendiary  they have the villain the incendiary in view Stop him stop an incendiary a murderer stop him  Exit  OLIVIA  Oh my terrors What can this new tumult mean  LEONTINE  Some new mark I suppose of Mr Honeywood's sincerity But we shall have satisfaction he shall give me instant satisfaction  OLIVIA  It must not be my Leontine if you value my esteem or my happiness Whatever be our fate let us not add guilt to our misfortunesConsider that our innocence will shortly be all we have left us You must forgive him  LEONTINE  Forgive him Has he not in every instance betrayed us Forced me to borrow money from him which appears a mere trick to delay us promised to keep my father engaged till we were out of danger and here brought him to the very scene of our escape  OLIVIA  Don't be precipitate We may yet be mistaken  Enter POSTBOY dragging in JARVIS HONEYWOOD entering soon after  POSTBOY  Aye master we have him fast enough Here is the incendiary dog I'm entitled to the reward I'll take my oath I saw him ask for the money at the bar and then run for it  HONEYWOOD  Come bring him along

old fool and that you are my masterthat's all  HONEYWOOD  Confusion  LEONTINE  Yes Sir I find you have kept your word with me After such baseness I wonder how you can venture to see the man you have injured  HONEYWOOD  My dear Leontine by my life my honour  LEONTINE  Peace peace for shame and do not continue to aggravate baseness by hypocrisy I know you Sir I know you  HONEYWOOD  Why won't you hear me By all that's just I knew not  LEONTINE  Hear you Sir to what purpose I now see through all your low arts your ever complying with every opinion your never refusing any request your friendship as common as a prostitute's favours and as fallacious all these Sir have long been contemptible to the world and are now perfectly so to me  HONEYWOOD  Ha contemptible to the world That reaches me  Aside  LEONTINE  All the seeming sincerity of your professions I now find were only allurements to betray and all your seeming regret for their consequences only calculated to cover the cowardice of your heart Draw villain  Enter CROAKER out of breath  CROAKER  Where is the villain Where is the incendiary  Seizing the postboy  Hold him fast the dog he has the gallows in his face Come you dog

we thought was the rogue and turns out to be one of the company  CROAKER  How  HONEYWOOD  Mr Croaker we have all been under a strange mistake here I find there is nobody guilty it was all an error entirely an error of our own  CROAKER  And I say Sir that you're in an error for there's guilt and double guilt a plot a damned jesuitical pestilential plot and I must have proof of it  HONEYWOOD  Do but hear me  CROAKER  What you intend to bring 'em off I suppose I'll hear nothing  HONEYWOOD  Madam you seem at least calm enough to hear reason  OLIVIA  Excuse me  HONEYWOOD  Good Jarvis let me then explain it to you  JARVIS  What signifies explanations when the thing is done  HONEYWOOD  Will nobody hear me Was there ever such a set so blinded by passion and prejudice  To the postboy  My good friend I believe you'll be surprised when I assure you  POSTBOY  Sure me nothingI'm sure of nothing but a good beating  CROAKER  Come then you madam if you ever hope for any favour or forgiveness tell me sincerely all you know of this affair  OLIVIA  Unhappily Sir I'm but too much the cause of your suspicions you see before you Sir one that with false pretences has stept into your family to betray it not your daughter  CROAKER  Not my daughter  OLIVIA  Not your daughterbut a mean deceiverwhosupport me I cannot  HONEYWOOD  Help she's going give her air  CROAKER  Aye aye take the young woman to the air I would not hurt a hair of her head whose ever daughter she may benot so bad as that neither  Exeunt all but  Croaker  CROAKER  Yes yes all's out I now see the whole affair my son is either married or going to be so to this lady whom he imposed upon me as his sister Aye certainly so and yet I don't find it afflicts me so much as one might think There's the advantage of fretting away our misfortunes beforehand we never feel them when they come  Enter Miss RICHLAND and Sir WILLIAM  Sir WILLIAM  But how do you know madam that my nephew intends setting off from this place  Miss RICHLAND  My maid assured me he was come to this inn and my own knowledge of his intending to leave the kingdom suggested the rest But what do I see my guardian here before us Who my dear Sir could have expected meeting you here to what accident do we owe this pleasure  CROAKER  To a fool I believe  Miss RICHLAND  But to what purpose did you come  CROAKER  To play the fool  Miss RICHLAND  But with whom  CROAKER  With greater fools than myself  Miss RICHLAND  Explain  CROAKER  Why Mr Honeywood brought me here to do nothing now I am here and my son is going to be married to I don't know who that is here so now you are as wise as I am  Miss RICHLAND  Married to whom Sir  CROAKER  To Olivia my daughter as I took her to be but who the devil she is or whose daughter she is I know no more than the man in the moon  Sir WILLIAM  Then Sir I can inform you and though a stranger yet you shall find me a friend to your family it will be enough at present to assure you that both in point of birth and fortune the young lady is at least your son's equal Being left by her father Sir James Woodville  CROAKER  Sir James Woodville What of the west  Sir WILLIAM  Being left by him I say to the care of a mercenary wretch whose only aim was to secure her fortune to himself she was sent to France under pretence of education and there every art was tried to fix her for life in a convent contrary to her inclinations Of this I was informed upon my arrival at Paris and as I had been once her father's friend I did all in my power to frustrate her guardian's base intentions I had even meditated to rescue her from his authority when your son stept in with more pleasing violence gave her liberty and you a daughter  CROAKER  But I intend to have a daughter of my own chusing Sir A young lady Sir whose fortune by my interest with those who have interest will be double what my son has a right to expect Do you know Mr Lofty Sir  Sir WILLIAM  Yes Sir and know that you are deceived in him But step this way and I'll convince you    Croaker  and  Sir William  seem to confer  Enter HONEYWOOD  HONEYWOOD  Obstinate man still to persist in his outrage insulted by him despised by all I now begin to grow contemptible even to myself How have I sunk by  too great an assiduity to please How have I overtaxed all my abilities lest the approbation of a single fool should escape me But all is now over I have survived my reputation my fortune my friendships and nothing remains henceforward for me but solitude and repentance  Miss RICHLAND  Is it true Mr Honeywood that you are setting off without taking leave of your friends The report is that you are quitting England Can it be  HONEYWOOD  Yes madam and though I am so unhappy as to have fallen under your displeasure yet thank Heaven I leave you to happiness to one who loves you and deserves your love to one who has power to procure you affluence and generosity to improve your enjoyment of it  Miss RICHLAND  And are you sure Sir that the gentleman you mean is what you describe him  HONEYWOOD  I have the best assurances of it his serving me He does indeed deserve the highest happiness and that is in your power to confer As for me weak and wavering as I have been obliged by all and incapable of serving any what happiness can I find but in solitude What hope but in being forgotten  Miss RICHLAND  A thousand to live among friends that esteem you whose happiness it will be to be permitted to oblige you  HONEYWOOD  No madam my resolution is fixed Inferiority among strangers is easy but among those that once were equals insupportable Nay to shew you how far my resolution can go I can now speak with calmness of my former follies my vanity my dissipation my weakness I will even confess that among the number of my other presumptions I had the insolence to think of loving you Yes madam while I was pleading the passion of another my heart was tortur'd with its own But it is over it was unworthy our friendship and let it be forgotten  Miss RICHLAND  You amaze me  HONEYWOOD  But you'll forgive it I know you will since the confession should not have come from me even now but to convince you of the sincerity of my intention ofnever mentioning it more  Going  Miss RICHLAND  Stay Sir one momentHa he here  Enter LOFTY  LOFTY  Is the coast clear None but friends I have followed you here with a trifsing piece of intelligence but it goes no farther things are not yet ripe for a discovery I have spirits working at a certain board your affair at the treasury will be done in less thana thousand years Mum  Miss RICHLAND  Sooner Sir I should hope  LOFTY  Why yes I believe it may if it falls into proper hands that know where to push and where to parry that know how the land lieseh Honey wood  Miss RICHLAND  It has fallen into yours  LOFTY  Well to keep you no longer in suspense your thing is done It is done I saythat's all I have just had assurances from Lord Neverout that the claim has been examined and found admissible  Quietus  is the word madam  HONEYWOOD  But how his lordship has been at Newmarket these ten days  LOFTY  Indeed Then Sir Gilbert Goose must have been most damnably mistaken I had it of him  Miss RICHLAND  He why Sir Gilbert and his family have been in the country this month  LOFTY  This month It must certainly be soSir Gilbert's letter did come to me from Newmarket so that he must have met his lordship there and so it came about I have his letter about me I'll read it to you  Taking out a large bundle  That's from Paoli of Corsica that from the marquis of SquilachiHave you a mind to see a letter from count Poniatowski now king of PolandHonest Pon  Searching  O Sir what are you here too I'll tell you what honest friend if you have not absolutely delivered my letter to Sir William Honeywood you may return it The thing will do without him  Sir WILLIAM  Sir I have delivered it and must inform you it was received with the most mortifying contempt  CROAKER  Contempt Mr Lofty what can that mean  LOFTY  Let him go on let him go on I say You'll find it come to something presently  Sir WILLIAM  Yes Sir I believe you'll be amazed if after waiting some time in the antichamber after being surveyed with insolent curiosity by the passing servants  I was at last assured that Sir William Honeywood knew no such person and I must certainly have been imposed upon  LOFTY  Good let me die very good Ha ha ha  CROAKER  Now for my life I can't find out half the goodness of it  LOFTY  You can't Ha ha  CROAKER  No for the soul of me I think it was as confounded a bad answer as ever was sent from one private gentleman to another  LOFTY  And so you can't find out the force of the message Why I was in the house at that very time Ha ha It was I that sent that very answer to my own letter Ha ha  CROAKER  Indeed How why  LOFTY  In one word things between Sir William and me must be behind the curtain A party has many eyes He sides with lord Buzzard I side with Sir Gilbert Goose So that unriddles the mystery  CROAKER  And so it does indeed and all my suspicions are over  LOFTY  Your suspicions What then you have been suspecting you have been suspecting have you Mr Croaker you and I were friends we are friends no longer Never talk to me It's over I say it's over  CROAKER  As I hope for your favour I did not mean to offend It escaped me Don't be discomposed  LOFTY  Zounds Sir but I am discomposed and will be discomposed To be treated thus Who am I Was it for this I have been dreaded both by ins and outs Have I been libelled in the Gazetteer and praised in the St James's have I been chaired at Wildman's and a speaker at MerchantTaylors Hail have I had my hand to addresses and my head in the printshops and talk to me of suspects  CROAKER  My dear Sir be pacified What can you have but asking pardon  LOFTY  Sir I will not be pacifiedSuspects Who am I To be used thus Have I paid court to men in favour to serve my friends the lords of the treasury Sir William Honeywood and the rest of the gang and talk to me of suspects Who am I I say who am I  Sir WILLIAM  Since Sir you are so pressing for an answer I'll tell you who you are A gentleman as well acquainted with politics as with men in power as well acquainted with persons of fashion as with modesty with lords of the treasury as with truth and with all as you are with Sir William Honeywood I am Sir William Honeywood  Discovering his ensigns of the Bath  CROAKER  Sir William Honeywood  HONEYWOOD  Astonishment my uncle  Aside  LOFTY  So then my confounded genius has been all this time only leading me up to the garret in order to fling me out of the window  CROAKER  What Mr Importance and are these your works Suspect yon You who have been dreaded by the ins and outs you who have had your hand to addresses and your head stuck up in printshops If you were served right you should have your head stuck up in the pillory  LOFTY  Aye stick it where you will for by the Lord it cuts but a very poor figure where it sticks at present  Sir WILLIAM  Well Mr Croaker I hope you now see how incapable this gentleman is of serving you and how little Miss Richland has to expect from his influence  CROAKER  Aye Sir too well I see it and I can't but say I have had some boding of it these ten days So I'm resolved since my son has placed his affections on a lady of moderate fortune to be satisfied with his choice and not run the hazard of another Mr Lofty in helping him to a better  Sir WILLIAM  I approve your resolution and here they come to receive a confirmation of your pardon and consent  Enter Mrs CROAKER JARVIS LEONTINE and OLIVIA  Mrs CROAKER  Where's my husband Come come lovey you must forgive them Jarvis here has been to tell me the whole affair and I say you must forgive them Our own was a stolen match you know my dear and we never had any reason to repent of it  CROAKER  I wish we could both say so However this gentleman Sir William Honeywood has been beforehand with you in obtaining their pardon So if the two poor fools have a mind to marry I think we can tack them together without crossing the Tweed for it  Joining their hands  LEONTINE  How blest and unexpected What what can we say to such goodness But our future obedience shall be the best reply And as for this gentleman to whom we owe  Sir WILLIAM  Excuse me Sir if I interrupt your thanks as I have here an interest that calls me  Turning to  Honeywood    Yes Sir you are surprised to see me and I own that a desire of correcting your follies led me hither I saw with indignation the errors of a mind that only sought applause from others that easiness of disposition which though inclined to the right had not courage to condemn the wrong I saw with regret those splendid errors that still took name from some neighbouring duty Your charity that was but injustice your benevolence that was but weakness and your friendship but credulity I saw with regret great talents and extensive learning only employed to add sprightliness to error and encrease your perplexities I saw your mind with a thousand natural charms but  the greatness of its beauty served only to heighten my pity for it's prostitution  HONEYWOOD  Cease to upbraid me Sir I have for some time but too strongly felt the justice of your reproaches But there is one way still left me Yes Sir I have determined this very hour to quit for ever a place where I have made myself the voluntary slave of all and to seek among strangers that fortitude which may give strength to the mind and marshal all its dissipated virtues Yet ere I depart permit me to solicit favour for this gentleman who notwithstanding what has happened has laid me under the most signal obligations Mr Lofty  LOFTY  Mr Honeywood I'm resolved upon a reformation as well as you I now begin to find that the man who first invented the art of speaking truth was a much cunninger fellow than I thought him And to prove that I design to speak truth for the future I must now assure you that you owe your late enlargement to another as upon my soul I had no hand in the matter So now if any of the company has a mind for preferment he may take my place I'm determined to resign  Exit  HONEYWOOD  How have I been deceived  Sir WILLIAM  No Sir you have been obliged to a kinder fairer friend for that favour To Miss Richland Would she complete our joy and make the man she has honoured by her friendship happy in her love I should then forget all and be as blest as the welfare of my dearest knisman can make me  Miss RICHLAND  After what is past it would be but affectation to pretend to indifference Yes I will own an attachment which I find was more than friendship And if my intreaties cannot alter his resolution to quit the country I will even try if my hand has not power to detain him  Giving her hand  HONEYWOOD  Heavens how can I have deserved all this How express my happiness my gratitude A moment like this overpays an age of apprehension  CROAKER  Well now I see content in every face but Heaven send we be all better this day three months  Sir WILLIAM  Henceforth nephew learn to respect yourself He who secks only for applause from without has all his happiness in another's keeping  HONEYWOOD  Yes Sir I now too plainly perceive my errors My vanity in attempting to please all by fearing to offend any My meanness in approving folly lest fools should disapprove Henceforth therefore it shall be my study to reserve my pity for real distress my friendship for true merit and my love for her who first taught me what it is to be happy  EPILOGUE  The author in expectation of an Epilogue from a friend at Oxford deferred writing one himself till the very last hour What is here offered owes all it's success to the graceful manner of the actress who spoke it

friends with pleasure in their eyes  Sinks as he sinks and as he rises rise  He nods they nod he cringes they grimace  But not a soul will budge to give him place  Since then unhelp'd our bard must

COMEDY  AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  FIRST PRINTED IN MDCCLXXII  TO SAMUEL JOHNSON LLD  DEAR SIR  BY inscribing this slight performance to you I do not mean so much to compliment you as myself It may do me some honour to inform the public that I have lived many years in intimacy with you It may serve the interests of mankind also to inform them that the greatest wit may be found in a character without impairing the most unaffected piety  I have particularly reason to thank you for your partiality to this performance The undertaking a comedy not merely sentimental was very dangerous and Mr Colman who saw this piece in its various stages always thought it so However I ventured to trust it to the public and though it was necessarily delayed till late in the season I have every reason to be grateful I am  DEAR SIR  YOUR MOST SINCERE FRIEND AND ADMIRER OLIVER GOLDSMITH  PROLOGUE  BY DAVID GARRICK ESQ  Enter Mr Woodward dressed in Black and holding a

THE FIRST  SCENE a Chamber in an oldfashioned House  Enter Mrs HARDCASTLE and Mr HARDCASTLE  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I VOW Mr Hardcastle you're very particular Is there a creature in the whole country but ourselves that does not take a trip to town now and then to rub off the rust a little There's the two Miss Hoggs and our neighbour Mrs Grigsby go to take a month's polishing every winter  HARDCASTLE  Aye and bring back vanity and affectation to last them the whole year I wonder why London cannot keep its own fools at home In my time the  follies of the town crept slowly among us but now they travel faster than a stagecoach Its fopperies come down not only as inside passengers but in the very basket  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Aye your times were fine times indeed you have been telling us of them for many a long year Here we live in an old rumbling mansion that looks for all the world like an inn but that we never see company Our bell visitors are old Mrs Oddfish the curate's wife and little Cripplegate the lame dancingmaster and all our entertainment your old stories of prince Eugene and the duke of Marylborough I hate such oldfashioned trumpery  HARDCASTLE  And I love it I love every thing that's old old friends old times old manners old books old wine and I believe Dorothy  taking her hand  you'll own I have been pretty fond of an old wife  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Lord Mr Hardcastle you're for ever at your Dorothy's and your old wife's You may be a Darby but I'll be no Joan I promise you I'm not so old as you'd make me by more than one good year Add twenty to twenty and make money of that  HARDCASTLE  Let me see twenty added to twenty makes just fifty and seven  Mrs HARDCASTLE  It's false Mr Hardcastle I was but twenty when I was brought to bed of Tony that I had by Mr Lumpkin my first husband and he's not come to years of discretion yet  HARDCASTLE  Nor ever will I dare answer for him Aye you have taught him finely  Mrs HARDCASTLE  No matter Tony Lumpkin has a good fortune My son is not to live by his learning I don't think a boy wants much learning to spend fifteen hundred a year  HARDCASTLE  Learning quotha A mere composition of tricks and mischief  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Humour my dear nothing but humour Come Mr Hardcastle you must allow the boy a little humour  HARDCASTLE  I'd sooner allow him an horsepond If burning the footmens shoes frighting the maids and worrying the kittens be humour he has it It was but yesterday he fastened my wig to the back of my chair and when I went to make a bow I popt my bald head in Mrs Frizzle's face  Mrs HARDCASTLE  And am I to blame The poor boy was always too sickly to do any good A school would be his  death When he comes to be a little stronger who knows what a year or two's Latin may do for him  HARDCASTLE  Latin for him A cat and fiddle No no the alehouse and the stable are the only schools he'll ever go to  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Well we must not snub the poor boy now for I believe we shan't have him long among us Any body that looks in his face may see he's consumptive  HARDCASTLE  Aye if growing too fat be one of the symptoms  Mrs HARDCASTLE  He coughs sometimes  HARDCASTLE  Yes when his liquor goes the wrong way  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I'm actually afraid of his lungs  HARDCASTLE  And truly so am I for he sometimes whoops like a speaking trumpet  Tony hallooing behind the scenes  O there he goesA very consumptive figure truly  Enter TONY crossing the Stage  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Tony where are you going my charmer Won't you give papa and I a little of your company lovee  TONY  I'm in haste mother I cannot stay  Mrs HARDCASTLE  You shan't venture out this raw evening my dear You look most shockingly  TONY  I can't stay I tell you The three pigeons expects me down every moment There's some fun going forward  HARDCASTLE  Aye the alehouse the old place I thought so  Mrs HARDCASTLE  A low paltry set of fellows  TONY  Not so low neither There's Dick Muggins the exciseman Jack Slang the horse doctor little Aminadab that grinds the music box and Tom Twist that spins the pewter platter  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Pray my dear disappoint them for one night at least  TONY  As for disappointing them I should not so much mind but I can't abide to disappoint myself  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Detaining him  You shan't go  TONY  I will I tell you  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I say you shan't  TONY  We'll see which is strongest you or I  Exit hauling her out  HARDCASTLE solus  Aye there goes a pair that only spoil each other But is not the whole age in a combination to drive sense and discretion out of doors There's my pretty darling Kate the fashions of the times have almost infected her too By living a year or two in town she is as fond of gauze and French frippery as the best of them  Enter Miss HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Blessings on my pretty innocence drest out as usual my Kate Goodness What a quantity of superfluous silk hast thou got about thee girl I could never teach the fools of this age that the indigent world could be cloathed out of the trimmings of the vain  Miss HARDCASTLE  You know our agreement Sir You allow me the morning to receive and pay visits and to dress in my own manner and in the evening I put on my housewife's dress to please you  HARDCASTLE  Well remember I insist on the terms of our agrement and by the bye I believe I shall have occasion to try your obedience this very evening  Miss HARDCASTLE  I protest Sir I don't comprehend your meaning  HARDCASTLE  Then to be plain with you Kate I expect the young gentleman I have chosen to be your busband from town this very day I have his father's letter in which he informs me his son is set out and that he intends to follow himself shortly after  Miss HARDCASTLE  Indeed I wish I had known something of this before Bless me how shall I behave It's a thousand to one I shan't like him our meeting will be so formal and so like a thing of business that I shall find no room for friendship or esteem  HARDCASTLE  Depend upon it child I'll never controul your choice but Mr Marlow whom I have pitched upon is the son of my old friend Sir Charles Marlow of whom you have heard me talk so often The young gentleman has been bred a scholar and is designed for an employment in the service of his country I am told he's a man of an excellent understanding  Miss HARDCASTLE  Is he  HARDCASTLE  Very generous  Miss HARDCASTLE  I believe I shall like him  HARDCASTLE  Young and brave  Miss HARDCASTLE  I'm sure I shall like him  HARDCASTLE  And very handsome  Miss HARDCASTLE  My dear papa say no more  kissing his hand  he's mine I'll have him  HARDCASTLE  And to crown all Kate he's one of the most bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world  Miss HARDCASTLE  Eh you have frozen me to death again That word reserved has undone all the rest of his accomplishments A reserved lover it is said always makes a suspicious husband  HARDCASTLE  On the contrary modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues It was the very feature in his character that first struck me  Miss HARDCASTLE  He must have more striking features to catch me I promise you However if he be so young so handsome and so every thing as you mention I believe he'll do still I think I'll have him  HARDCASTLE  Aye Kate but there is still an obstacle It's more than an even wager he may not have you  Miss HARDCASTLE  My dear papa why will you mortisy one soWell if he refuses instead of breaking my heart at his indifference I'll only break my glass for its flattery Set my cap to some newer fashion and look out for some less difficult admirer  HARDCASTLE  Bravely resolved In the mean time I'll go prepare the servants for his reception as we seldom see company they want as much training as a company of recruits the first day's muster  Exit  Miss HARDCASTLE sola  Lud this news of papa's puts me all in a flutter Young handsome these he put last but I put them foremost Sensible goodnatured I like all that But then reserved and sheepish that's much against him Yet can't he be cured of his timidity by being taught to be proud of his wife Yes and can't IBut I vow I'm disposing of the husband before I have secur'd the lover  Enter Miss NEVILLE  Miss HARDCASTLE  I'm glad you're come Neville my dear Tell me Constance how do I look this evening Is there any thing whimsical about me Is it one of my well looking days child am I in face today  Miss NEVILLE  Perfectly my dear Yet now I look againbless mesure no accident has happened among the canary birds or the gold fishes Has your brother or the cat been medling or has the last novel been too moving  Miss HARDCASTLE  No nothing of all this I have been threatenedI can scarce get it outI have been threatened with a lover  Miss NEVILLE  And his name  Miss HARDCASTLE  Is Marlow  Miss NEVILLE  Indeed  Miss HARDCASTLE  The son of Sir Charles Marlow  Miss NEVILLE  As I live the most intimate friend of Mr Hastings my admirer They are never asunder I  believe you must have seen him when we lived in town  Miss HARDCASTLE  Never  Miss NEVILLE  He's a very singular character I assure you Among women of reputation and virtue he is the modestest man alive but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another stamp you understand me  Miss HARDCASTLE  An odd character indeed I shall never be able to manage him What shall I do Pshaw think no more of him but trust to occurrences for success But how goes on your own affair my dear has my mother been courting you for my brother Tony as usual  Miss NEVILLE  I have just come from one of our agreeable têteatêtes She has been saying a hundred tender things and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection  Miss HARDCASTLE  And her partiality is such that she actually thinks him so A fortune like yours is no small temptation Besides as she has the sole management of it I'm not surprized to see her unwilling to let it go out of the family  Miss NEVILLE  A fortune like mine which chiefly consists in jewels is no such mighty temptation But at any rate if my dear Hastings be but constant I make no doubt to be too hard for her at last However I let her suppose that I am in love with her son and me never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another  Miss HARDCASTLE  My good brother holds out stoutly I could almost love him for hating you so  Miss NEVILLE  It is a goodnatured creature at bottom and I'm sure would wish to see me married to any body but himself But my aunt's bell rings for our afternoon's walk

punch and tobacco TONY at the Head of the Table a little higher than the rest a mallet in his hand  OMNES  Hurrea hurrea hurrea bravo  FIRST FELLOW  Now gentlemen silence for a song The 'squire is going to knock himself down for a song  OMNES  Aye a song a song  TONY  Then I'll sing you gentlemen a song I made upon this alehouse the Three Pigeons  SONG  Let schoolmasters puzzle their brain  With grammar and nonsense and learning  Good liquor I stoutly maintain  Gives  genus  a better discerning  Let them brag of their heathenish gods  Their Lethes their Styxes and Stygians  Their qui's and their quae's and their quod's  They're all but a parcel of pigeons  Toroddle toroddle toroll  When methodist preachers come down  A preaching that drinking is sinful  I'll wager the rascals a crown  They always preach best with a skinful  But when you come down with your pence  For a slice of their scurvy religion  I'll leave it to all men of sense  But you my good friend are the pigeon  Toroddle toroddle toroll  Then come put the jorum about  And let us be merry and clever  Our hearts and our liquors are stout  Here's the three jolly pigeons for ever  Let some cry up woodcock or hare

the genteel thing at any time If so be that a gentleman bees in a concatenation accordingly  THIRD FELLOW  I like the maxum of it master Muggins What though I am obligated to dance a bear a man may be a gentleman for all that May this be my poison if my bear ever dances but to the very genteelest of tunes "Water Parted" or "the minuet in Ariadne"  SECOND FELLOW  What a pity it is the 'squire is not come to his own It would be well for all the publicans within ten miles round of him  TONY  Ecod and so it would master Slang I'd then shew what it was to keep choice of company  SECOND FELLOW  O he takes after his own father for that To be sure old 'squire Lumpkin was the finest gentleman I ever set my eyes on For winding the straight horn or beating a thicket for a hare or a wench he never had his fellow It was a saying in the place that he kept the best horses dogs and girls in the whole county  TONY  Ecod and when I'm of age I'll be no bastard I promise you I have been thinking of Bett Bouncer and the miller's grey mare to begin with But come my boys drink about and be merry for you pay no reckoning Well Stingo what's the matter  Enter LANDLORD  LANDLORD  There be two gentlemen in a postchaise at the door They have lost their way upo' the forest and they are talking something about Mr Hardcastle  TONY  As sure as can be one of them must be the gentleman that's coming down to court my sister Do they seem to be Londoners  LANDLORD  I believe they may They look woundily like Frenchmen  TONY  Then desire them to step this way and I'il set them right in a twinkling  Exit Landlord  Gentlemen as they may'nt be good enough company for you step down for a moment and I'll be with you in the squeezing of a lemon  Exeunt mob  TONY solus  Fatherinlaw has been calling me whelp and hound this half year Now if I pleased I could be so revenged upon the old grumbletonian But then I'm afraidafraid of what I shall soon be worth fifteen hundred a year and let him frighten me out of that if he can  Enter LANDLORD conducing MARLOW and HASTINGS  MARLOW  What a tedious uncomfortable day have we had of it We were told it was but forty miles across the country and we have come above threescore  HASTINGS  And all Marlow from that unaccountable reserve of yours that would not let us inquire more frequently on the way  MARLOW  I own Hastings I am unwilling to lay myself under an obligation to every one I meet and often stand the chance of an unmannerly answer  HASTINGS  At present however we are not likely to receive any answer  TONY  No offence gentlemen But I'm told you have been inquiring for one Mr Hardcastle in those parts Do yon know what part of the country you are in  HASTINGS  Not in the least Sir but should thank you for information  TONY  Nor the way you came  HASTINGS  No Sir but if you can inform us  TONY  Why gentlemen if you know neither the road you are going nor where you are nor the road you came the first thing I have to inform you is thatyou have lost your way  MARLOW  We wanted no ghost to tell us that  TONY  Pray gentlemen may I be so bold as to ask the place from whence you came  MARLOW  That's not necessary towards directing us where we are to go  TONY  No offence but question for question is all fair you know Pray gentlemen is not this same Hardcastle a crossgrain'd oldfashion'd whimsical fellow with an ugly face a daughter and a pretty son  HASTINGS  We have not seen the gentleman but lie has the family you mention  TONY  The daughter a tall trapesing trolloping talkative maypolethe son a pretty wellbred agreeable youth that every body is fond of  MARLOW  Our information differs in this The daughter is said to be wellbred and beautiful the son an aukward booby reared up and spoiled at his mother's apronstring  TONY  HehehemThen gentlemen all I have to tell you is that you won't reach Mr Hardcastle's house this night I believe  HASTINGS  Unfortunate  TONY  It's a damn'd long dark boggy dirty dangerous way Stingo tell the gentlemen the way to  Mr Hardcastle's  Winking upon the Landlord  Mr Hardcastle's of Quagmire Marsh you understand me  LANDLORD  Master Hardcastle's Lockadaisy my masters you're come a deadly deal wrong When you came to the bottom of the hill you should have cross'd down Squashlane  MARLOW  Cross down Squasnlane  LANDLORD  Then you were to keep straight forward 'till you came to four roads  MARLOW  Come to where four roads meet  TONY  Aye but you must be sure to take only one of them  MARLOW  O Sir you're facetious  TONY  Then keeping to the right you are to go sideways till you come upon Crackskull common there you must look sharp for the track of the wheel and go forward 'till you come to farmer Murrain's barn Coming to the farmer's barn you are to turn to the right and then to the left and then to the right about again till you find out the old mill  MARLOW  Zounds man we could as soon find out the longitude  HASTINGS  What's to be done Marlow  MARLOW  This house promises but a poor reception though perhaps the landlord can accommodate us  LANDLORD  Alack master we have but one spare bed in the whole house  TONY  And to my knowledge that's taken up by three lodgers already  After a pause in which the rest seem disconcerted  I have hit it Don't you think Stingo our landlady could accommodate the gentlemen by the fireside withthree chairs and a bolster  HASTINGS  I hate sleeping by the fireside  MARLOW  And I detest your three chairs and a bolster  TONY  You do do youthen let me seewhatif you go on a mile further to the Buck's Head the old Buck's Head on the hill one of the best inns in the whole county  HASTINGS  O ho so we have escaped an adventure for This night however  LANDLORD  Apart to Tony  Sure you ben't sending them to your father's as an inn be you  TONY  Mum you fool you Let them find that out  To them  You have only to keep on straight forward till you come to a large old house by the road side You'll see a pair of large horns over the door That's the sign Drive up the yard and call stoutly about you  HASTINGS  Sir we are obliged to you The servants can't miss the way  TONY  No no but I tell you though the landlord is rich and going to leave off business so he wants to be thought a gentleman saving your presence he he he He'll be for giving you his company and ecod if you mind him he'll persuade you that his mother was an alderman and his aunt a justice of peace  LANDLORD  A troublesome old blade to be sure but a keeps as good wines and beds as any in the whole country  MARLOW  Well if he supplies us with these we shall want no further connection We are to turn to the right did you say  TONY  No no straight forward I'll just step myself and shew you a piece of the way  To the landlord  Mum  LANDLORD  Ah bless your heart for a sweet pleasantdamn'd mischievous son of a whore  Exeunt  ACT THE SECOND  SCENE an oldfashioned House  Enter HARDCASTLE followed by three or four aukward servants  HARDCASTLE  WELL I hope you're perfect in the table exercise I have been teaching you these three days You all know your posts and your places and can shew that you have been used to good company without ever stirring from home  OMNES  Aye aye  HARDCASTLE  When company comes you are not to pop out and stare and then run in again like frighted rabbits in a warren  OMNES  No no  HARDCASTLE  You Diggory whom I have taken from the barn are to make a shew at the sidetable and you Roger whom I have advanced from the plough are to  place yourself behind my chair But you're not to stand so with your hands in your pockets Take your hands from your pockets Roger and from your head you blockhead you See how Diggory carries his hands They're a little too stiff indeed but that's no great matter  DIGGORY  Aye mind how I hold them I learned to hold my hands this way when I was upon drill for the militia And so being upon drill  HARDCASTLE  You must not be so talkative Diggory You must be all attention to the guests You must hear us talk and not think of talking you must see us drink and not think of drinking you must see us eat and not think of eating  DIGGORY  By the laws your worship that's parfectly unpossible Whenever Diggory sees yeating going forward ecod he's always wishing for a mouthful himself  HARDCASTLE  Blockhead Is not a bellyfull in the kitchen as good as a bellyfull in the parlour Stay your stomach with that reflection  DIGGORY  Ecod I thank your worship I'll make a shift to stay my stomach with a slice of cold beef in the pantry  HARDCASTLE  Diggory you are too talkative Then if I happen to say a good thing or tell a good story at table you must not all burst out alaughing as if you made part of the company  DIGGORY  Then ecod your worship must not tell the story of ould grouse in the gun room I can't help laughing at thathe he hefor the soul of me We have laughed at that these twenty yearsha ha ha  HARDCASTLE  Ha ha ha The story is a good one Well honest Diggory you may laugh at thatbut still remember to be attentive Suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine how will you behave A glass of wine Sir if you please  To Diggory  Eh why don't you move  DIGGORY  Ecod your worship I never have courage till I see the eatables and drinkables brought upo' the table and then I'm as bauld as a lion  HARDCASTLE  What will nobody move  FIRST SERVANT  I'm not to leave this place  SECOND SERVANT  I'm sure it's no place of mine  THIRD SERVANT  Nor mine for sartain  DIGGORY  Wauns and I'm sure it canna be mine  HARDCASTLE  You numbskulls and so while like your betters you are quarrelling for places the guests must be starved O you dunces I find I must begin all over againBut don't I hear a coach drive into the yard To your posts you blockheads I'll go in the mean time and give my old friend's son a hearty reception at the gate  Exit  Hardcastle  DIGGORY  By the elevens my place is gone quite out of my head  ROGER  I know that my place is to be every where  FIRST SERVANT  Where the devil is mine  SECOND SERVANT  MY pleace is to be no where at all and so ize go about my business  Exeunt servants running about as if frighted different ways  Enter SERVANT with Candles shewing in MARLOW and HASTINGS  SERVANT  Welcome gentlemen very welcome This way  HASTINGS  After the disappointments of the day welcome Once more Charles to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire Upon my word a very welllooking house antique but creditable  MARLOW  The usual fate of a large mansion Having first ruined the master by good housekeeping it at last comes to levy contributions as an inn  HASTINGS  As you say we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries I have often seen a good sideboard or a marble chimneypiece though not actually put in the bill inflame a reckoning confoundedly  MARLOW  Travellers George must pay in all places The only difference is that in good inns you pay dearly for luxuries in bad inns you are fleeced and starved  HASTINGS  You have lived pretty much among them In truth I have been often surprised that you who have seen so much of the world with your natural good sense and your many opportunities could never yet acquire a requite share of assurance  MARLOW  The Englishman's malady But tell me George where  ould I have learned that assurance you talk  of My life has been chiefly spent in a college or an inn in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence I don't know that I was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest womanexcept my motherBut among females of another class you know  HASTINGS  Aye among them you are impudent enough of all conscience  MARLOW  They are of  us  you know  HASTINGS  But in the company of women of reputation I never saw such an idiot such a trembler you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of stealing out of the room  MARLOW  Why man that's because I do want to steal out of the room Faith I have often formed a resolution to break the ice and rattle away at any rate But I don't know how a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my resolution An impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty but I'll be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence  HASTINGS  If you could but say half the fine things to them that I have heard you lavish upon the barmaid of an inn or even a college bedmaker  MARLOW  Why George I can't say fine things to them they freeze they petrify me They may talk of a comet or a burning mountain or some such bagatelle But to me a Modest woman drest out in all her finery is the most tremendous object of the whole creation  HASTINGS  Ha ha ha At this rate man how can you ever expect to marry  MARLOW  Never unless as among kings and princes my bride were to be courted by proxy If indeed like an eastern bridegroom one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before it might be endured But to go through all the terrors of a formal courtship together with the episode of aunts grandmothers and cousins and at last to blurt out the broad staring question of madam will you marry me No no that's a strain much above me I assure you  HASTINGS  I pity you But how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father  MARLOW  As I behave to all other ladies Bow very low Answer yes or no to all her demandsBut for the rest I don't think I shall venture to look in her face till I see my father's again  HASTINGS  I'm surprised that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover  MARLOW  To be explicit my dear Hastings my chief inducement down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness not my own Miss Neville loves you the family don't know you as my friend you are sure of a reception and let honour do the rest  HASTINGS  My dear Marlow But I'll suppress the emotion Were I a wretch meanly seeking to carry off a fortune you should be the last man in the world I would apply to for assistance But Miss Neville's person is all I ask and that is mine both from her deceased father's consent and her own inclination  MARLOW  Happy man You have talents and art to captivate any woman I'm doom'd to adore the sex and yet to converse with the only part of it I despise This stammer in my address and this aukward prepossessing visage of mine can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliner's 'prentice or one of the duchesses of Drurylane Pshaw this fellow here to interrupt us  Enter HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Gentlemen once more you are heartily welcome Which is Mr Marlow Sir you're heartily welcome It's not my way you see to receive my friends with my back to the fire I like to give them a hearty reception in the old style at my gate I like to see their horses and trunks taken care of  MARLOW aside  He has got our names from the servants already  To him  We approve your caution and hospitality Sir  To Hastings  I have been thinking George of changing our travelling dresses in the morning I am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine  HARDCASTLE  I beg Mr Marlow you'll use no ceremony in this house  HASTINGS  I fancy George you're right the first blow is half the battle I intend opening the campaign with the white and gold  HARDCASTLE  Mr MarlowMr Hastingsgentlemenpray be under no constraint in this house This is Libertyhall gentlemen You may do just as you please here  MARLOW  Yet George if we open the campaign too fiercely at first we may want ammunition before it  is over I think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat  HARDCASTLE  Your talking of a retreat Mr Marlow puts me in wind of the duke of Marlborough when we went to besiege Denain He first summoned the garrison  MARLOW  Don't you think the  ventre dór  waistcoat will do with the plain brown  HARDCASTLE  He first summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men  HASTINGS  I think not brown and yellow mix but very poorly  HARDCASTLE  I say gentlemen as I was telling you he summoned The garrison which might consist of about five thousand men  MARLOW  The girls like finery  HARDCASTLE  Which might consist of about five thousand men well appointed with stores ammunition and other implements of war Now says the duke of Marlborough to George Brooks that stood next to himyou must have heard of George BrooksI'll  pawn my dukedom says he but I take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood So  MARLOW  What my good friend if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour  HARDCASTLE  Punch Sir  Aside  This is the most unaccountable kind of modesty I ever met with  MARLOW  Yes Sir punch A glass of warm punch after our journey will be comfortable This is Libertyhall you know  HARDCASTLE  Here's cup Sir  MARLOW  Aside  So this fellow in his Libertyhall will only let us have just what he pleases  HARDCASTLE  Taking the cup  I hope you'll find it to your mind I have prepared it with my own hands and I believe you'll own the ingredients are tolerable Will you be so good as to pledge me Sir Here Mr Marlow here is to our better acquaintance  Drinks  MARLOW  Aside  A very impudent fellow this but he's a character and I'll humour him a little Sir my service to you  Drinks  HASTINGS  Aside  I see this fellow wants to give us his company and forgets that he's an innkeeper before he has learned to be a gentleman  MARLOW  From the excellence of your cup my old friend I suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country Warm work now and then at elections I suppose  HARDCASTLE  No Sir I have long given that work over Since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other there is no business 'for us that sell ale'  HASTINGS  So then you have no turn for politics I find  HARDCASTLE  Not in the least There was a time indeed I fretted myself about the mistakes of government like other people but finding myself every day grow more angry and the government growing no better I left it to mend itself Since that I no more trouble my head about Heyder Ally or Ally Cawn than about Ally Croaker Sir my service to you  HASTINGS  So that with eating above stairs and drinking below with receiving your friends within and amusing them without you lead a good pleasant bustling life of it  HARDCASTLE  I do stir about a great deal that's certain Half the differences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour  MARLOW  After drinking  And you have an argument in your cup old gentleman better than any in Westminsterhall  HARDCASTLE  Aye young gentleman that and a little philosophy  MARLOW  Aside  Well this is the first time I ever heard of an innkeeper's philosophy  HASTINGS  So then like an experienced general you attack them on every quarter If you find their reason manageable you attack it with your philosophy if you find they have no reason you attack them with this Here's your health my philosopher  Drinks  HARDCASTLE  Good very good thank you ha ha Your generalship puts me in mind of prince Eugene when he fought the Turks at the battle of Belgrade You shall hear  MARLOW  Instead of the battle of Belgrade I believe it's almost time to talk about supper What has your philosophy got in the house for supper  HARDCASTLE  For supper Sir  Aside  Was ever such a request to a man in his own house  MARLOW  Yes Sir supper Sir I begin to feel an appetite I shall make dev'lish work tonight in the larder I promise you  HARDCASTLE  Aside  Such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld  To him  Why really Sir as for supper I can't well tell My Dorothy and the cookmaid settle these things between them I leave these kind of things entirely to then  MARLOW  Yon do do you  HARDCASTLE  Entirely Bythebye I believe they are in actual consultation upon what's for supper this moment in the kitchen  MARLOW  Then I beg they'll admit me as one of their privy council It's a way I have got When I travel I always chuse to regulate my own supper Let the cook be called No offence I hope Sir  HARDCASTLE  O no Sir none in the least yet I don't know how our Bridget the cookmaid is not very communicative upon these occasions Should we send for her she might scold us all out of the house  HASTINGS  Let's see your list of the larder then I ask it as a favour I always match my appetite to my bill of fare  MARLOW  To Hardcastle who looks at them with surprise  Sir he's very right and it's my way too  HARDCASTLE  Sir you have a right to command here Here Roger bring us the bill of fare for tonight's supper I believe it's drawn out Your manner Mr Hastings puts me in mind of my uncle colonel Wallop It was a saying of his that no man was sure of his supper till he had eaten it  HASTINGS  Aside  All upon the high ropes His uncle a colonel We shall soon hear of his mother being a justice of peace But let's hear the bill of fare  MARLOW  Perusing  What's here For the first course for the second course for the desert The devil Sir do you think we have brought down the whole joiners company or the corporation of Bedford to eat up such a supper Two or three little things clean and comfortable will do  HASTINGS  But let's hear it  MARLOW  Reading  For the first course at the top a pig and pruin sauce  HASTINGS  Damn your pig I say  MARLOW  And damn your pruin sauce say I  HARDCASTLE  And yet gentlemen to men that are hungry pig with pruin sauce is very good eating  MARLOW  At the bottom a calve's tongue and brains  HASTINGS  Let your brains be knock'd out my good Sir I don't like them  MARLOW  Or you may clap them on a plate by themselves  HARDCASTLE  Aside  Their impudence confounds me  To them  Gentlemen you are my guests make what alterations you please Is there any thing else you wish to retrench or alter gentlemen  MARLOW  Item A pork pye a boiled rabbit and sausages a Florentine a shaking pudding and a dish of tifftafftaffety cream  HASTINGS  Confound your made dishes I shall be as much at a loss in this house as at a green and yellow dinner  at the French ambassador's table I'm for plain eating  HARDCASTLE  I'm sorry gentlemen that I have nothing you like but if there be any thing you have a particular fancy to  MARLOW  Why really Sir your bill of fare is so exquisite that any one part of it is full as good as another Send us what you please So much for supper And now to see that our beds are air'd and properly taken care of  HARDCASTLE  I entreat you'll leave all that to me You shall not stir a step  MARLOW  Leave that to you I protest Sir you must excuse me I always look to these things myself  HARDCASTLE  I must insist Sir you'll make yourself easy on that head  MARLOW  You see I'm resolved on it  Aside  A very troublesome fellow this as ever I met with  HARDCASTLE  Well Sir I'm resolved at least to attend you  Aside  This may be modern modesty but I never saw any thing look so like oldfashioned impudence  Exeunt  Marlow  and  Hardcastle  HASTINGS solus  So I find this fellow's civilities begin to grow troublesome But who can be angry at those assiduities Which are meant to please him Ha what do I see Miss Neville by all that's happy  Enter Miss NEVILLE  Miss NEVILLE  My dear Hastings To what unexpected good fortune to what accident am I to ascribe this happy meeting  HASTINGS  Rather let me ask the same question as I could never have hoped to meet my dearest Constance at an inn  Miss NEVILLE  An inn sure you mistake my aunt my guardian lives here What could induce you to think this hóuse an inn  HASTINGS  My friend Mr Marlow with whom I came down and I have been sent here as to an inn I assure you A young fellow whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us hither  Miss NEVILLE  Certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousin's tricks of whom you have heard me talk so often ha ha ha  HASTINGS  He whom your aunt intends for you he of whom I have such just apprehensions  Miss NEVILLE  You have nothing to fear from him I assure you You'd adore him if you knew how heartily he despises me My aunt knows it too and has undertaken to court me for him and actually begins to think she has made a conquest  HASTINGS  Thou dear dissembler You must know my Constance I have just seized this happy opportunity of my friend's visit here to get admittance into the family The horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey but they'll soon be refreshed and then if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful Hastings we shall soon be landed in France where even among slaves the laws of marriage are respected  Miss NEVILLE  I have Often told you that though ready to obey you I yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance The greatest part of it was left me by my uncle the India director and chiefly consists in jewels I have been for some time persuading my aunt to let me wear them I fancy I'm very near succeeding The instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours  HASTINGS  Perish the baubles Your person is all I desire In the mean time my friend Marlow must not be let into his mistake I know the strange reserve of his temper is such that if abruptly informed of it he would instanly quit die house before our plan was ripe for execution  Miss NEVILLE  But how shall we keep him in the deception Miss Hardcastle is just returned from walking what if we still continue to deceive himThis this way  They confer  Enter MARLOW  MARLOW  The assiduities of these good people teize me beyond bearing My host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone and so he claps not only himself but his oldfashioned wife on my back They talk of coming to sup with us too and then I suppose we are to run the gauntlet through all the rest of the familyWhat have we got here  HASTINGS  My dear Charles Let me congratulate youThe most fortunate accidentWho do you think is just alighted  MARLOW  Cannot guess  HASTINGS  Our mistresses boy Miss Hardcastle and Miss Neville Give me leave to introduce Miss Constance Neville to your acquaintance Happening to dine in the neighbourhood they called on their return to take fresh horses here Miss Hardcastle has just stept into the next room and will be back in an instant Wasn't it lucky eh  MARLOW  Aside  I have been mortified enough of all conscience and here comes something to complete my embarrassment  HASTINGS  Well but was'nt it the most fortunate thing in the world  MARLOW  Oh yes Very fortunatea most joyful encounterBut our dresses George you know are in disorderWhat if we should postpone the happiness 'till tomorrowTomorrow at her own houseIt will be every bit as convenientand rather more respectfulTomorrow let it be  Offering to go  Miss NEVILLE  By no means Sir Your ceremony will displease her The disorder of your dress will shew the ardour of your impatience Besides she knows you are in the house and will permit you to see her  MARLOW  O the devil how shall I support it hem hem Hastings you must not go You are to assist me you know I shall be confoundedly ridiculous Yet hang it I'll take courage Hem  HASTINGS  Pshaw man it's but the first plunge and all's over She's but a woman you know  MARLOW  And of all women she that I dread most to encounter  Enter Miss HARDCASTLE as returned from walking a bonnet c  HASTINGS introducing them  Miss Hardcastle Mr Marlow I'm proud of bringing two persons of such merit together that only want to know to esteem each other  Miss HARDCASTLE  Aside  Now for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face and quite in his own manner  After a pause in which be appears very uneasy and disconcerted  I'm glad of your safe arrival SirI'm told you had some accidents by the way  MARLOW  Only a few madam Yes we had some Yes madam a good many accidents but should be sorrymadamor rather glad of any accidentsthat are so agreeably concluded Hem  HASTINGS  To him  You never spoke better in your whole life Keep it up and I'll insure you the victory  Miss HARDCASTLE  I'm afraid you flatter Sir You that have seen so much of the finest company can find little entertainment in an obscure corner of the country  MARLOW  Gathering courage  I have lived indeed in the world madam but I have kept very little company I have been but an observer upon life madam while others were enjoying it  Miss NEVILLE  But that I am told is the way to enjoy it at last  HASTINGS  To him  Cicero never spoke better Once more and you are confirmed in assurance for ever  MARLOW  To him  Hem stand by me then and when I'm down throw in a word or two to set me up again  Miss HARDCASTLE  An observer like you upon life were I fear disagreeably employed since you must have had much more to censure than to approve  MARLOW  Pardon me madam I was always willing to be amused The folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness  HASTINGS  To him  Bravo bravo Never spoke so well in your whole life Well Miss Hardcastle I see that you and Mr Marlow are going to be very good company I believe our being here will but embarrass the interview  MARLOW  Not in the least Mr Hastings We like your company of all things  To him  Zounds George sure you won't go how can you leave us  HASTINGS  Our presence will but spoil conversation so we'll retire to the next room  To him  Yon don't consider man that we are to manage a little têteàtête of our own  Exeunt  Miss HARDCASTLE  After a pause  I But you have not been wholly an observer I presume Sir the ladies I should hope have employed some part of your addresses  MARLOW  Relapsing into timidity  Pardon me madam IIIas yet have studiedonlytodeserve them  Miss HARDCASTLE  And that some say is the very worst way to obtain them  MARLOW  Perhaps so madam But I love to converse only with the more grave and sensible part Of the sexBut I'm afraid I grow tiresome  Miss HARDCASTLE  Not at all Sir there is nothing I like so much as grave conversation myself I could hear it for ever Indeed I have often been surprised how a man of sentiment could ever admire those light airy pleasures where nothing reaches the heart  MARLOW  It'sa diseaseof the mind madam In the variety of tastes there must be some who wanting a relishforumaum  Miss HARDCASTLE  I understand you Sir There must be some who wanting a relish for refined pleasures pretend to despise what they are incapable of tasting  MARLOW  My meaning madam but infinitely better expressed And I can't help observinga  Miss HARDCASTLE  Aside  Who could ever suppose this fellow impudent upon such occasions  To him  You were going to observe Sir  MARLOW  I was observing madamI protest madam I forget what I was going to observe  Miss HARDCASTLE  Aside  I vow and so do I  To him  You were observing Sir that in this age of hypocrisy something about hypocrisy Sir  MARLOW  Yes madam In this age of hypocrisy there are few who upon strict inquiry do notaaa  Miss HARDCASTLE  I understand you perfectly Sir  MARLOW  Aside  Egad and that's more than I do myself  Miss HARDCASTLE  You mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they practise in private and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it  MARLOW  True madam those who have most virtue in their mouths have least of it in their bosoms But I'm sure I tire you madam  Miss HARDCASTLE  Not in the least Sir there's something so agreeable and spirited in your manner such life and forcepray Sir go on  MARLOW  Yes madam I was sayingthat there are some occasionswhen a total want of courage madam destroys all theand puts usupon aaa  Miss HARDCASTLE  I agree with you entirely a want of courage upon some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance  and betrays us when we most want to excel I beg you'll proceed  MARLOW  Yes madam Morally speaking madamBut I see Miss Neville expecting us in the next room I would not intrude for the world  Miss HARDCASTLE  I protest Sir I never was more agreeably entertained in all my life Pray go on  MARLOW  Yes madam I wasBut she beckons us to join her Madam shall I do myself the honour to attend you  Miss HARDCASTLE  Well then I'll follow  MARLOW  Aside  This pretty smooth dialogue has done for me  Exit  Miss HARDCASTLE sola  Ha ha ha Was there ever such a sober sentimental interview I'm certain he scarce look'd in my face the whole time Yet the fellow but for his unaccountable bashfulness is pretty well too He has good sense but then so buried in his fears that it fatigues one more than ignorance If I could teach him a little confidence it would be doing somebody that I know of a piece of service But who is that somebodyThat faith is a question I can scarce answer  Exit  Enter TONY and Miss NEVILLE followed by Mrs HARDCASTLE and HASTINGS  TONY  What do you follow me for cousin Con I wonder you're not asham'd to be so very engaging  Miss NEVILLE  I hope cousin one may speak to one's own relations and not be to blame  TONY  Aye but I know what sort of a relation you want to make me though but it won't do I tell you cousin Con it won't do so I beg you'll keep your distance I want no nearer relationship  She follows coquetting him to the back scene  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Well I vow Mr Hastings you are very entertaining There's nothing in the world I love to talk of so much as London and the fashions though I was never there myself  HASTINGS  Never there You amaze me From your air and manner I conclude you had been bred all your life either at Ranelagh St James's or Tower Wharf  Mrs HARDCASTLE  O Sir you're only pleased to say so We country persons can have no manner at all I'm in love with the town and that serves to raise me  above some of our neighbouring rustics but who can have a manner that has never seen the Pantheon the Grotto Gardens the Borough and such places where the nobility chiefly resort All I can do is to enjoy London at secondhand I take care to know every têteàtête from the scandalous magazine and have all the fashions as they come out in a letter from the two Miss Rickets of Crookedlane Pray how do you like this head Mr Hastings  HASTINGS  Extremely elegant and degagée upon my word madam your friseur is a Frenchman I suppose  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I protest I dressed it myself from a print in the ladies memorandumbook for the last year  HASTINGS  Indeed Such a head in a sidebox at the playhouse would draw as many gazers as my lady may'ress at a city ball  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I vow since inoculation began there is no such thing to be seen as a plain woman so one must dress a little particular or one may escape in the crowd  HASTINGS  But that can never be your case madam in any dress  Bowing  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Yet what signifies my dressing when I have such a piece of antiquity by my side as Mr Hardcastle all I can say will never argue down a single button from his cloaths I have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig and where he was bald to plaister it over like my Lord Pately with powder  HASTINGS  You are right madam for as among the ladies there are none ugly so among the men there are none old  Mrs HARDCASTLE  But what do you think his answer was Why with his usual Gothic vivacity he said I only wanted him to throw off his wig to convert it into a tête for my own wearing  HASTINGS  Intolerable At your age you may wear what you please and it must become you  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Pray Mr Hastings what do you take to be the most fashionable age about town  HASTINGS  Some time ago forty was all the mode but I'm told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Seriously Then I shall be too young for the fashion  HASTINGS  No lady begins now to put on jewels 'till she's past forty For instance Miss there in a polite circle would be considered as a child as a mere maker of samplers  Mrs HARDCASTLE  And yet Mrs Niece thinks herself as much a woman and is as fond of jewels as the oldest of us all  HASTINGS  Your niece is she And that young gentleman a brother of yours I should presume  Mrs HARDCASTLE  My son Sir They are contracted to each other Observe their little sports They fall in and out ten times a day as if they were man and wife already  To them  Well Tony child what soft things are you saying to your cousin Constance this evening  TONY  I have been saying no soft things but that it's very hard to be followed about so Ecod I've not a place in the house now that's left to myself but the stable  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Never mind him Con my dear He's in another story behind your back  Miss NEVILLE  There's something generous in my cousin's manner He falls out before faces to be forgiven in private  TONY  That's a damned confoundedcrack  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Ah he's a sly one Don't you think they're like each other about the month Mr Hastings The Blenkinsop mouth to a T They're of a size too Back to back my pretties that Mr Hastings may see you Come Tony  TONY  You had as good not make me I tell you  Measuring

longer  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Is this ungrateful boy all that I'm to get for the pains I have taken in your education I that have rock'd yon in your cradle and fed that pretty mouth with a spoon Did not I work that waistcoat to make you genteel Did not I prescribe for  you every day and weep while the receipt was operating  TONY  Ecod you had reason to weep for you have been dosing me ever since I was born I have gone through every receipt in the complete housewife ten times over and you have thoughts of coursing me through Quincy next spring But ecod I tell you I'll not be made a fool of no longer  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Wasn't it all for your good viper Wasn't it all for your good  TONY  I wish you'd let me and my good alone then Snubbing this way when I'm in spirits If I'm to have any good let it come of itself not to keep dinging it dinging it into one so  Mrs HARDCASTLE  That's false I never see you when you're in spirits No Tony you then go to the alehouse or kennel I'm never to be delighted with your agreeable wild notes unfeeling monster  TONY  Ecod mamma your own notes are the wildest of the two  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Was ever the like But I see he wants to break my heart I see he does  HASTINGS  Dear madam permit me to lecture the young gentleman a little I'm certain I can persuade him to his duty  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Well I must retire Come Constance my love You see Mr Hastings the wretchedness of my situation was ever poor woman so plagued with a dear sweet pretty provoking undutiful boy  Exeunt  Mrs Hardcastle  and  Miss Neville  HASTINGS TONY  TONY singing  "There was a young man riding by and fain would have his will Rang do didlo dee"Don't mind her Let her cry It's the comfort of her heart I have seen her and sister cry over a book for an hour together and they said they liked the book the better the more it made them cry  HASTINGS  Then you're no friend to the ladies I find my pretty young gentleman  TONY  That's as I find 'um  HASTINGS  Not to her of your mother's chusing I dare answer And yet she appears to me a pretty welltempered girl  TONY  That's because you don't know her as well as I Ecod I know every inch about her and there's not a more bitter cantanckerous toad in all christendom  HASTINGS  Aside  Pretty encouragement this for a lover  TONY  I have seen her since the height of that She has as many tricks as a hare in a thicket or a colt the first day's breaking  HASTINGS  To me she appears sensible and silent  TONY  Aye before company But when she's with her playmate she's as loud as a hog in a gate  HASTINGS  But there is a meek modesty about her that charms me  TONY  Yes but curb her never so little she kicks up and you're flung in a ditch  HASTINGS  Well but you must allow her a little beautyYes you must allow her some beauty  TONY  Bandbox She's all a made up thing mum Ah could you but see Bet Bouncer of these parts  you might then talk of beauty Ecod she has two eyes as black as stoes and cheeks as broad and red as a pulpit cushion She'd make two of she  HASTINGS  Well what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands  TONY  Anon  HASTINGS  Would you thank him that would take Miss Neville and leave you to happiness and your dear Betsy  TONY  Aye but where is there such a friend for who would take her  HASTINGS  I am he If you but assist me I'll engage to whip her off to France and you shall never hear more of her  TONY  Assist you Ecod I will to the last drop of my blood I'll clap a pair of horses to your chaise that shall trundle you off in a twinkling and may be get you a part of her fortin beside in jewels that you little dream of  HASTINGS  My dear 'squire this looks like a lad of spirit  TONY  Come along then and you shall see more of my spirit before you have done with me  Singing  We are the boys  That fears no noise  Where the thundering cannons roar  Exeunt  ACT THE THIRD  Enter HARDCASTLE solus  HARDCASTLE  WHAT could my old friend Sir Charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in town To me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue He has taken possession of the easy chair by the fireside already He took off his boots in the parlour and desired me to see them taken care of I'm desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughterShe will certainly be shocked at it  Enter Miss HARDCASTLE plainly dressed  HARDCASTLE  Well my Kate I see you have changed your dress as I bid you and yet I believe there was no great occasion  Miss HARDCASTLE  I find such a pleasure Sir in obeying your commands that I take care to observe them without ever debating their propriety  HARDCASTLE  And yet Kate I sometimes give you some cause particularly when I recommended my modest gentleman to you as a lover today  Miss HARDCASTLE  You taught me to expect something extraordinary and I find the original exceeds the description  HARDCASTLE  I was never so surprised in my life He has quite confounded all my faculties  Miss HARDCASTLE  I never saw any thing like it and a man of the world too  HARDCASTLE  Aye he learned it all abroadwhat a fool was I to think a young man could learn modesty by travelling He might as soon learn wit at a masquerade  Miss HARDCASTLE  It seems all natural to him  HARDCASTLE  A good deal assisted by bad company and a French dancingmaster  Miss HARDCASTLE  Sure you mistake papa A French dancingmaster could never have taught him that timid lookthat aukward addressthat bashful manner  HARDCASTLE  Whose look whose manner child  Miss HARDCASTLE  Mr Marlow's his  mauvaise honte  his timidity struck me at the first sight  HARDCASTLE  Then your first sight deceived you for I think him one of the most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses  Miss HARDCASTLE  Sure Sir you rally I never saw any one so modest  HARDCASTLE  And can you be serious I never saw such a bouncing swaggering puppy since I was born Bully Dawson was but a fool to him  Miss HARDCASTLE  Surprising He met me with a respectful bow a stammering voice and a look fixed on the ground  HARDCASTLE  He met me with a loud voice a lordly air and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again  Miss HARDCASTLE  He treated me with diffidence and respect censured the manners of the age admired the prudence of girls that never laughed tired me with apologies for being tiresome then left the room with a bow and "madam I would not for the world detain you"  HARDCASTLE  He spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before Asked twenty questions and never waited  for an answer interrupted my best remarks with some silly pun and when I was in my best story of the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene he asked if I had not a good hand at making punch Yes Kate he asked your father if he was a maker of punch  Miss HARDCASTLE  One of us must certainly be mistaken  HARDCASTLE  If he be what he he has shewn himself I'm determined he shall never have my consent  Miss HARDCASTLE  And if he be the fullen thing I take him he shall never have mine  HARDCASTLE  In one thing then we are agreedto reject him  Miss HARDCASTLE  Yes But upon conditions For if you should find him less impudent and I more presuming if you find him more respectful and I more importunateI don't knowthe fellow is well enough for a manCertainly we don't meet many such at a horse race in the country  HARDCASTLE  If we should find him soBut that's impossible The first appearance has done my business I'm seldom deceived in that  Miss HARDCASTLE  And yet there may be many good qualities under that first appearance  HARDCASTLE  Aye when a girl finds a fellow's outside to her taste she then sets about guessing the rest of his furniture With her a smooth face stands for good sense and a genteel figure for every virtue  Miss HARDCASTLE  I hope Sir a conversation begun with a compliment to my good sense won't end with a sneer at my understanding  HARDCASTLE  Pardon me Kate But if young Mr Brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions he may please us both perhaps  Miss HARDCASTLE  And as one of us must be mistaken what if we go to make further discoveries  HARDCASTLE  Agreed But depend on't I'm in the right  Miss HARDCASTLE  And depend on't I'm not much in the wrong  Exeunt  Enter TONY running in with a casket  TONY  Ecod I have got them Here they are My cousin Con's necklaces bobs and all My mother shan't cheat the poor souls out of their fortin neither O my genus is that you  Enter HASTINGS  HASTINGS  My dear friend how have you managed with your mother I hope you have amused her with pretending love for your cousin and that you are willing to be reconciled at last Our horses will be refreshed in a short time and we shall soon be ready to set off  TONY  And here's something to bear your charges by the way  giving the casket  your sweetheart's jewels Keep them and hang those I say that would rob you of one of them  HASTINGS  But how have you procured them from your mother  TONY  Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no fibs I procured them by the rule of thumb If I had not a key to every drawer in mother's bureau how could I go to the alehouse so often as I do An honest man may rob himself of his own at any time  HASTINGS  Thousands do it every day But to be plain with you Miss Neville is endeavouring to procure them from her aunt this very instant If she succeeds it will be the most delicate way at least of obtaining them  TONY  Well keep them till you know how it will be But I know how it will be well enough she'd as soon part with the only sound tooth in her head  HASTINGS  But I dread the effects of her resentment when she finds she has lost them  TONY  Never you mind her resentment leave me to manage that I don't value her resentment the bounce of a cracker Zounds here they are Morrice Prance  Exit  Hastings  TONY Mrs HARDCASTLE and Miss NEVILLE  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Indeed Constance you amaze me Such a girl as you want jewels It will be time enough for jewels my dear twenty years hence when your beauty begins to want repairs  Miss NEVILLE  But what will repair beauty at forty will certainly improve it at twenty madam  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Yours my dear can admit of none That natural blush is beyond a thousand ornaments Besides child jewels are quite out at present Don't you see half the ladies of our acquaintance my lady Killdaylight and Mrs Crump and the rest of  them carry their jewels to town and bring nothing but paste and marcasites back  Miss NEVILLE  But who knows madam but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Consult your glass my dear and then see if with such a pair of eyes you want any better sparklers What do you think Tony my dear does your cousin Con want any jewels in your eyes to set off her beauty  TONY  That's as thereafter may be  Miss NEVILLE  My dear aunt if you knew how it would oblige me  Mrs HARDCASTLE  A parcel of oldfashioned rose and table cut things They would make you look like the court of king Solomon at a puppetshew Besides I believe I can't readily come at them They may be missing for aught I know to the contrary  TONY  Apart to Mrs Hardcastle  Then why don't you tell her so at once as she's so longing for them Tell her they're lost It's the only way to quiet her Say they're lost and call me to bear witness  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Apart to Tony  You know my dear I'm only keeping them for you So if I say they're gone you'll bear me witness will you He he he  Tony  Never sear me Ecod I'll say I saw them taken out with my own eyes  Miss NEVILLE  I desire them but for a day madam Just to be permitted to shew them as relics and then they may be lock'd up again  Mrs HARDCASTLE  To be plain with you my dear Constance if I could find them you should have them They're missing I assure you Lost for aught I know but we must have patience wherever they are  Miss NEVILLE  I'll not believe it this is but a shallow pretence to deny me I know they're too valuable to be so slightly kept and as you are to answer for the loss  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Don't be alarm'd Constance If they be lost I must restore an equivalent But my son knows they are missing and not to be found  TONY  That I can bear witness to They are missing and not to be found I'll take my oath on't  Mrs HARDCASTLE  You must learn resignation my dear for though we lose our fortune yet we should not lose our patience See me how calm I am  Miss NEVILLE  Aye people are generally calm at the misfortunes of others  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Now I wonder a girl of your good sense should waste a thought upon such trumpery We shall soon find them and in the mean time you shall make use of my garnets till your jewels be found  Miss NEVILLE  I detest garnets  Mrs HARDCASTLE  The most becoming things in the world to set off a clear complexion You have often seen how well they look upon me You shall have them  Exit  Miss NEVILLE  I dislike them of all things You shan't stirWas ever any thing so provoking to mislay my own jewels and force me to wear her trumpery  TONY  Don't be a fool If she gives you the garnets take what you can get The jewels are your own already I have stolen them out of her bureau and she does not know it Fly to your spark he'll tell you more of the matter Leave me to manage her  Miss NEVILLE  My dear cousin  TONY  Vanish She's here and has missed them already Zounds how she fidgets and spits about like a catharine wheel  Enter Mrs HARDCASTLE  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Confusion thieves robbers we are cheated

jewels taken out and I'm undone  TONY  Oh is that all Ha ha ha By the laws I never saw it better acted in my life Ecod I thought you was ruin'd in earnest ha ha ha  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Why boy I'm ruin'd in earnest My bureau has been broke open and all taken away  TONY  Stick to that ha ha ha stick to that I'll bear witness you know call me to bear witness  Mrs HARDCASTLE  I tell you Tony by all

mamma you make me for to laugh ha ha I know who took them well enough ha ha ha  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Was there ever such a blockhead that can't tell the difference between jest and earnest I tell you I'm not in jest booby  TONY  That's right that's right you must be in a bitter passion and then nobody will suspect either of us I'll bear witness that they are gone  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Was there ever such a crossgrain'd brute that won't hear me Can you bear witness that you're no better than a fool Was ever poor woman so beset with fools on one hand and thieves on the other  TONY  I can bear witness to that  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Bear witness again you blockhead you and I'll turn you out of the room directly My poor niece what will become of her Do you laugh you unfeeling brute as if you enjoyed my distress  TONY  I can bear witness to that  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Do you insult me monster I'll teach you to vex your mother I will  TONY  I can bear witness to that  He runs off she follows him  Enter Miss HARDCASTLE and Maid  Miss HARDCASTLE  What an unaccountable creature is that brother of mine to send them to the house as an inn ha ha I don't wonder at his impudence  MAID  But what is more madam the young gentleman as you passed by in your present dress ask'd me if you were the barmaid He mistook you for the barmaid madam  Miss HARDCASTLE  Did he Then as I live I'm resolved to keep up the delusion Tell me Pimple how do you like my present dress Don't you think I look something like Cherry in the Beaux Stratagem  MAID  It's the dress madam that every lady wears is the country but when she visits or receives company  Miss HARDCASTLE  And are you sure he does not remember my face or person  MAID  Certain of it  Miss HARDCASTLE  I vow I thought so for though we spoke for some time together yet his fears were such that he never once looked up during the interview Indeed if he had my bonnet would have kept him from seeing me  MAID  But what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake  Miss HARDCASTLE  In the first place I shall be seen and that is no small advantage to a girl who brings her face to market Then I shall perhaps make an acquaintance and that's no small victory gained over one who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex But my chief aim is to take my gentleman off his guard and like an invisible champion of romance examine the giant's force before I offer to combat  MAID  But are you sure you can act your part and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that as he has already mistaken your person  Miss HARDCASTLE  Never fear me I think I have got the true barcantDid your honour callAttend the Lion  therePipes and tobacco for the AngelThe Lamb has been outrageous this half hour  MAID  It will do madam But he's here  Exit  Maid  Enter MARLOW  MARLOW  What a bawling in every part of the house I have scarce a moment's repose If I go to the best room there I find my host and his story If I fly to the gallery there we have my hostess with her courtesy down to the ground I have at last got a moment to myself and now for recollection  Walks and muses  Miss HARDCASTLE  Did you call Sir Did your honour call  MARLOW  Musing  As for Miss Hardcastle she's too grave and sentimental for me  Miss HARDCASTLE  Did your honour call  She still places herself before him be turning away  MARLOW  No child  musing  Besides from the glimpse I had of her I think she squints  Miss HARDCASTLE  I'm sure Sir I heard the bell ring  MARLOW  No no  musing  I have pleased my father however by coming down and I'll tomorrow please myself by returning  Taking out his tablets and perusing  Miss HARDCASTLE  Perhaps the other gentleman called Sir  MARIOW  I tell you no  Miss HARDCASTLE  I should be glad to know Sir We have such a parcel of servants  MARLOW  No no I tell you  Looks full in her face  Yes child I think I did call I wantedI wantedI vow child you are vastly handsome  Miss HARDCASTLE  O la Sir you'll make one asham'd  MARLOW  Never saw a more sprightly malicious eye Yes yes my dear I did call Have you got any of yourawhat d'ye call it in the house  Miss HARDCASTLE  No Sir we have been out of that these ten days  MARLOW  One may call in this house I find to very little purpose Suppose I should call for a taste just by way of trial of the nectar of your lips perhaps I might be disappointed in that too  Miss HARDCASTLE  Nectar nectar That's a liquor there's no call for in those parts French I suppose We keep no French wines here Sir  MARLOW  Of true English growth I assure you  Miss HARDCASTLE  Then it's odd I should not know it We brew all sorts of wines in this house and I have lived here these eighteen years  MARLOW  Eighteen years Why one would think child you kept the bar before you were born How old are you  Miss HARDCASTLE  O Sir I must not tell my age They say women and music should never be dated  MARLOW  To guess at this distance you can't be much above forty  approaching  Yet nearer I don't think so much  approaching  By coming close to some women they look younger still but when we come very close indeed  attempting to kiss her  Miss HARDCASTLE  Pray Sir keep your distance One would think you wanted to know one's age as they do horses by mark of mouth  MARLOW  I protest child you use me extremely ill If you keep me at this distance how is it possible you and I can ever be acquainted  Miss HARDCASTLE  And who wants to be acquainted with you I want no such acquaintance not I I'm sure you did not treat Miss Hardcastle that was here awhile ago in this obstropalous manner I'll warrant me before her you look'd dash'd and kept bowing to the ground and talk'd for all the word as if you was before a justice of peace  MARLOW  Aside  Egad She has hit it sure enough  To her  In awe of her child s Ha ha ha A mere aukward squinting thing no no I find you don't know me I laugh'd and rallied her a little but I was unwilling to be too severe No I could not be too severe curse me  Miss HARDCASTLE  O then Sir you are a favourite I find among the ladies  MARLOW  Yes my dear a great favourite And yet hang me I don't see what they find in me to follow At the ladies club in town I'm called their agreeable Rattle Rattle child is not my real name but one I'm known by My name is Solomons Mr  Solomons my dear at your service  Offering to salute her  Miss HARDCASTLE  Hold Sir you are introducing me to your club not to yourself And you're so great a favourite there you say  MARLOW  Yes my dear There's Mrs Mantrap lady Betty Blackleg the countess of Sligo Mrs Langhorns old Miss Biddy Buckskin and your humble servant keep up the spirit of the place  Miss HARDCASTLE  Then it's a very merry place I suppose  MARLOW  Yes as merry as cards supper wine and old women can make us  Miss HARDCASTLE  And their agreeable Rattle ha ha ha  MARLOW  Aside  Egad I don't quite like this chit She looks knowing methinks You laugh child  Miss HARDCASTLE  I can't but laugh to think what time they all have for minding their work or their family  MARLOW  Aside  All's well she don't laugh at me  To her  Do you ever work child  Miss HARDCASTLE  Aye sure There's not a screen or a quilt in the whole house but what can bear witness to that  MARLOW  Odso then you must shew me your embroidery I embroider and draw patterns myself a little If you want a judge of your work you must apply to me  Seizing her hand  Miss HARDCASTLE  Aye but the colours do not look well by candlelight You shall see all in the morning  Struggling  MARLOW  And why not now my angel Such beauty fires beyond the power of resistancePshaw the father here My old luck I never nick'd seven that I did not throw ames ace three times following  Exit  Marlow  Enter HARDCASTLE who stands in surprize  HARDCASTLE  So madam So I find this is your modest lover This is your humble admirer that kept his eyes fixed on the ground and only ador'd at humble distance Kate Kate art thou not asham'd to deceive your father so  Miss HARDCASTLE  Never trust me dear papa but he's still the modest man I first took him for you'll be convinc'd of it as well as I  HARDCASTLE  By the hand of my body I believe his impudence is infectious Didn't I see him seize your hand Didn't I see him hawl you about like a milkmaid and now you talk of his respect and his modesty forsooth  Miss HARDCASTLE  But if I shortly convince you of his modesty that he has only the faults that will pass off with time and the virtues that will improve with age I hope you'll forgive him  HARDCASTLE  The girl would actually make one run mad I tell you I'll not be convinced I am convinced He has scarce been three hours in the house and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives You may like his impudence and call it modesty But my soninlaw madam must have very different qualifications  Miss HARDCASTLE  Sir I ask but this night to convince you  HARDCASTLE  You shall not have half the time for I have thoughts of turning him out this very hour  Miss HARDCASTLE  Give me that hour then and I hope to satisfy you  HARDCASTLE  Well an hour let it be then But I'll have no trifling with your father All fair and open do you mind me  Miss HARDCASTLE  I hope Sir you have ever found that I considered your commands as my pride for your kindness is such that my duty as yet has been inclination  ACT THE FOURTH  Enter HASTINGS and Miss NEVILLE  HASTINGS  YOU surprise me Sir Charles Marlow expected here this night Where have you had your information  Miss NEVILLE  You may depend upon it I just saw his letter to Mr Hardcastle in which he tells him he intends setting out a few hours after his son  HASTINGS  Then my Constance all must be compleated before he arrives He knows me and should he find me here would discover my name and perhaps my designs to the rest of the family  Miss NEVILLE  The jewels I hope are safe  HASTINGS  Yes yes I have sent them to Marlow who keeps the keys of our baggage In the mean time I'll go to prepare matters for our elopement I have had the squire's promise of a fresh pair of horses  and if I should not see him again will write him further directions  Exit  Miss NEVILLE  Well success attend you In the mean time I'll go amuse my aunt with the old pretence of a violent passion for my cousin  Exit  Enter MARLOW followed by a servant  MARLOW  I wonder what Hastings could mean by sending me so valuable a thing as a casket to keep for him when he knows the only place I have is the seat of a postcoach at an inndoor Have you deposited the casket with the landlady as I ordered you Have you put it into her own hands  SERVANT  Yes your honour  MARLOW  She said she'd keep it safe did she  SERVANT  Yes she said she'd keep it safe enough she ask'd me how I came by it and she said she had a great mind to make me give an account of myself  Exit  Servant  MARLOW  Ha ha ha They're safe however What an unaccountable set of beings have we got amongst This little barmaid though runs in my head most strangely and drives out the absurdities of all the  rest of the family She's mine she must be mine or I'm greatly mistaken  Enter HASTINCS  HASTINGS  Bless me I quite forgot to tell her that I intended to prepare at the bottom of the garden Marlow here and in spirits too  MARLOW  Give me joy George Crown me shadow me with laurels Well George after all we modest fellows don't want for success among the women  HASTINGS  Some women you mean But what success has your honour's modesty been crowned with now that it grows so insolent upon us  MARLOW  Didn't you see the tempting brisk lovely little thing that runs about the house with a bunch of keys to its girdle  HASTINGS  Well and what then  MARLOW  She's mine you rogue you Such fire such motion such eyes such lipsbut egad she would not let me kiss them though  HASTINGS  But are you so sure so very sure of her  MARLOW  Why man she talked of shewing me her work above stairs and I am to improve the pattern  HASTINGS  But how can you Charles go about to rob a woman of her honour  MARLOW  Pshaw pshaw We all know the honour of the barmaid of an inn I don't intend to rob her take my word for it there's nothing in this house I shan't honestly pay for  HASTINGS  I believe the girl has virtue  MARLOW  And if she has I should be the last man in the world that would attempt to corrupt it  HASTINGS  You have taken care I hope of the casket I sent you to lock up It's in safety  MARLOW  Yes yes It's safe enough I have taken care of it But how could you think the seat of a postcoach at an inndoor a place of safety Ah Numbskull I have taken better precautions for you than you did for yourselfI have  HASTINGS  What  MARLOW  I have sent it to the landlady to keep for you  HASTINGS  To the landlady  MARLOW  The landlady  HASTINGS  You did  MARLOW  I did She's to be answerable for its forthcoming you know  HASTINGS  Yes she'll bring it forth with a witness  MARLOW  Wasn't I right I believe you'll allow that I acted prudently upon this occasion  HASTINGS  Aside  He must not see my uneasiness  MARLOW  You seem a little disconcerted though methinks Sure nothing has happened  HASTINGS  No nothing Never was in better spirits in all my life And so you left it with the landlady who no doubt very readily undertook the charge  MARLOW  Rather too readily For she nor only kept the casket but through her great precaution was going to keep the messenger too Ha ha ha  HASTINGS  He he he They're safe however  MARLOW  As a guinea in a miser's purse  HASTINGS  Aside  So now all hopes of fortune are at an end and we must set off without it  To

goes  HARDCASTLE  I believe you do from my soul Sir But though I say nothing to your own conduct that of your servants is unsufferable Their manner of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house I assure you  MARLOW  I protest my very good Sir that is no fault of mine If they don't drink as they ought they are to blame I ordered them not to spare the cellar I did I assure you  To the side scene  Here let one of my servants come up  To him  My positive directions were that as I did not drink myself they should make up for my deficiencies below  HARDCASTLE  Then they had your orders for what they do I'm satisfied  MARLOW  They had I assure you You shall hear from one of themselves  Enter SERVANT drunk  MARLOW  You Jeremy Come forward sirrah What were my orders Were you not told to drink freely  and call for what you thought fit for the good of the house  HARDCASTLE  Aside  I begin to lose my patience  JEREMY  Please your honour liberty and Fleetstreet for ever Though I'm but a servant I'm as good as another man I'll drink for no man before supper Sir dammy Good liquor will sit upon a good supper but a good supper will not sit uponhiccupupon my conscience Sir  MARLOW  You

if I contain myself any longer Mr Marlow Sir I have submitted to your insolence for more than four hours and I see no likelihood of its coming to an end I'm now resolved to be master here Sir and I desire that you and your drunken pack may leave my house directly  MARLOW  Leave your houseSure you jest my good friend What when I'm doing what I can to please you  HARDCASTLE  I tell you Sir you don't please me so I desire you'll leave my house  MARLOW  Sure you cannot be serious at this time o'night and such a night You only mean to banter me  HARDCASTLE  I tell you Sir I'm serious and now that my passions are rouzed I say this house is mine Sir this house is mine and I command you to leave it directly  MARLOW  Ha ha ha A puddle in a storm I shan't stir a step I assure you  In a serious tone  This your house fellow It's my house This is my house Mine while I chuse to stay What right have you to bid me to leave this house Sir I never met with such impudence curse me never in my whole life before  HARDCASTLE  Nor I confound me if ever I did To come to my house to call for what he likes to turn me out of my own chair to insult the family to order his servants to get drunk and then to tell me "This house is mine Sir" By all that's impudent it makes me laugh Ha ha ha Pray Sir  bantering  as you take the house what think you of taking the rest of the furniture There's a pair of silver candlesticks and there's a firescreen and  here's a pair of brazen nosed bellows perhaps you may take a fancy to them  MARLOW  Bring me your bill Sir bring me your bill and let's make no more words about it  HARDCASTLE  There are a set of prints too What think you of the rake's progress for your own apartment  MARLOW  Bring me your bill I say and I'll leave you and your infernal house directly  HARDCASTLE  Then there's a mahogany table that you may see your own face in  MARLOW  My bill I say  HARDCASTLE  I had forgot the great chair for your own particular slumbers after a hearty meal  MARLOW  Zounds bring me my bill I say and let's hear no more on't  HARDCASTLE  Young man young man from your father's letter to me I was taught to expect a wellbred modest man as a visitor here but now I find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully but he will be down here presently and shall hear more of it  Exit  MARLOW  How's this Sure I have not mistaken the house Every thing looks like an inn The servants cry coming The attendance is aukward the barmaid too to attend us But she's here and will further inform me Whither so fast child A word with you  Enter Miss HARDCASTLE  Miss HARDCASTLE  Let it be short then I'm in a hurry  Aside  I believe he begins to find out his mistake but it's too soon quite to undeceive him  MARLOW  Pray child answer me one question What are you and what may your business in this house be  Miss HARDCASTLE  A relation of the family Sir  MARLOW  What a poor relation  Miss HARDCASTLE  Yes Sir A poor relation appointed to keep the keys and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them  MARLOW  That is you act as the barmaid of this inn  Miss HARDCASTLE  Inn O lawWhat brought that in your head One of the best families in the county keep an inn Ha ha ha old Mr Hardcastle's house an inn  MARLOW  Mr Hardcastle's house Is this house Mr Hardcastle's house child  Miss HARDCASTLE  Aye sure Whose else should it be  MARLOW  So then all's out and I have been damnably imposed on O confound my stupid head I shall be laugh'd at over the whole town I shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the printshops The  Dullissimo Maccaroni  To mistake this house of all others for an inn and my father's old friend for an innkeeper What a swaggering puppy must he take me for What a silly puppy do I find myself There again may I be hanged my dear but I mistook you for the barmaid  Miss HARDCASTLE  Dear me dear me I'm sure there's nothing in my behaviour to put me upon a level with one of that stamp  MARLOW  Nothing my dear nothing But I was in for a list of blunders and could not help making you a subscriber My stupidity saw every thing the wrong way I mistook your affiduity for assurance and  your simplicity for allurement But its overThis house I no more shew my face in  Miss HARDCASTLE  I hope Sir I have done nothing to disoblige you I'm sure I should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so polite and said so many civil things to me I'm sure I should be sorry  pretending to cry  if he left the family upon my account I'm sure I should be sorry people said any thing amiss since I have no fortune but my character  MARLOW  Aside  By Heaven she weeps This is the first mark of tenderness I ever had from a modest woman and it touches me  To her  Excuse me my lovely girl you are the only part of the family I leave with reluctance But to be plain with you the difference of our birth fortune and education make an honourable connection impossible and I can never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity that trusted in my honour of bringing ruin upon one whose only fault was being too lovely  Miss HARDCASTLE  Aside  Generous man I now begin to admire him  To him  But I'm sure my family is as good as Miss Hardcastle's and though I'm poor that's no great misfortune to a contented mind and until this moment I never thought that it was bad to want fortune  MARLOW  And why now my pretty simplicity  Miss HARDCASTLE  Because it puts me at a distance from one that if I had a thousand pound I would give it all to  MARLOW  Aside  This simplicity bewitches me so that if I stay I'm undone I must make one bold effort and leave her  To her  Your partiality in my favour my dear touches me most sensibly and were I to live for myself alone I could easily fix my choice But I owe too much to the opinion of the world too much to the authority of a father so thatI can scarcely speak itit affects me Farewel  Exit  Miss HARDCASTLE  I never knew half his merit till now He shall not go if I have power or art to detain him I'll still preserve the character in which I  stoop'd to conquer  but will undeceive my papa who perhaps may laugh him out of his resolution  Exit  Enter TONY Miss NEVILLE  TONY  Aye you may steal for yourselves the next time I have done my duty She has got the jewels again that's a sure thing but she believes it was all a mistake of the servants  Miss NEVILLE  But my dear cousin sure you won't forsake us in this distress If she in the least suspects that I am going off I shall certainly be locked up or sent to my aunt Pedigree's which is ten times worse  TONY  To be sure aunts of all kinds are damn'd bad things But what can I do I have got you a pair of horses that will fly like Whistlejacket and I'm sure you can't say but I have courted you nicely before her face Here she comes we must court a bit Or two more for fear she should suspect us  They retire and seem to fondle  Enter Mrs HARDCASTLE  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Well I was greatly fluttered to be sure But my son tells me it was all a mistake of the servants I shan't be easy however till they are fairly married and then let her keep her own fortune But what do I see fondling together as I'm alive I never saw Tony so sprightly before Ah have I caught you my pretty doves What billing exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs Ah  TONY  As for murmurs mother we grumble a little now and then to be sure But there's no love lost between us  Mrs HARDCASTLE  A mere sprinkling Tony upon the flame only to make it burn brighter  Miss NEVILLE  Cousin Tony promises to give us more of his company at home Indeed he shan't leave us any more It won't leave us cousin Tony will it  TONY  O it's a pretty creature No I'd sooner leave my horse in a pound than leave you when you smile upon one so Your laugh makes you so

for he must not hear us  They confer  TONY  Still gazing  A damn'd cramp piece of penmanship as ever I saw in my life I can read your print hand very well But here there are such handles and shanks and dashes that one can scarce tell the head from the tail "To Anthony Lumpkin esquire" It's very odd I can read the outside of my letters where my own name is well enough But when I come to open it it's allbuzz That's hard very hard for the inside of the letter is always the cream of the correspondence  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Ha ha ha Very well very well And so my son was too hard for the philosopher  Miss NEVILLE  Yes madam but you must hear the rest madam A little more this way or he may hear us You'll hear how he puzzled him again  Mrs HARDCASTLE  He seems strangely puzzled now himself methinks  TONY  Still gazing  A damn'd up and down hand as if it was disguised in liquor  Reading  Dear Sir Aye that's that Then there's an M and a T and an S but whether the next be an izzard or an R confound me I cannot tell  Mrs HARDCASTLE  What's that my dear Can I give you any assistance  Miss NEVILLE  Pray aunt let me read it No body reads a cramp hand better than I  twitching the letter from her  Do you know who it is from  TONY  Can't tell except from Dick Ginger the feeder  Miss NEVILLE  Aye so it is  pretending to read  Dear 'squire hoping that you're in health as I am at this present The

Of no consequence  Giving  Mrs Hardcastle  the letter  Mrs HARDCASTLE  How's this  reads  "Dear 'squire I'm now waiting for Miss Neville with a postchaise and pair at the bottom of the garden but I find my horses yet unable to perform the journey I expect you'll assist us with a pair of fresh horses as  you promised Dispatch is necessary as the hag aye the hag your mother will otherwise suspect

sinister design that belongs to another  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Curtesying very low  Fine spoken madam you are most miraculously polite and engaging and quite the very pink of curtesy and circumspection madam  Changing her tone  And you you great illfashioned oaf with scarce sense enough to keep your mouth shut Were you too join'd against me But I'll defeat all your plots in a moment As for you madam since you have got a pair of fresh horses ready it would be cruel to disappoint them So if you please instead of running away with your spark prepare this very moment to run off with me Your old aunt

Miss NEVILLE  So now I'm completely ruined  TONY  Aye that's a sure thing  Miss NEVILLE  What better could be expected from being connected with such a stupid fool and after all the nods and signs I made him  TONY  By the laws Miss it was your own cleverness and not my stupidity that did your business You were so nice and so busy with your Shakebags and Goosegreens that I thought you could never be making believe  Enter HASTINGS  HASTINGS  So Sir I find by my servant that you have shewn my letter and betray'd us Was this well done young gentleman  TONY  Here's another Ask Miss there who

ignorance and age are a protection  HASTINGS  A poor contemptible booby that would but disgrace correction  Miss NEVILLE  Yet with cunning and malice enough to make himself merry with all our embarrassments  HASTINGS  An insensible cub  MARLOW  Replete with tricks and mischief  TONY  Baw damme but I'll fight you both one after the otherwith baskets  MARLOW  As for him he's below resentment

SERVANT  SERVANT  Your fan muff and gloves madam The horses are waiting  Miss NEVILLE  O Mr Marlow if you knew what a scene of constraint and illnature lies before me I'm sure it would convert your resentment into pity  MARLOW  I'm so distracted with a variety of passions that I don't know what I do Forgive me madam George forgive me You know my hasty temper and should not exasperate it  HASTINGS  The torture of my situation is my only excuse  Miss NEVILLE  Well my dear Hastings if you have that esteem for me that I think that I am sure you have your constancy for three years will but

SCENE continues  Enter HASTINGS and SERVANT  HASTINGS  YOU saw the old lady and Miss Neville drive off you say  SERVANT  Yes your honour They went off in a post coach and the young 'squire went on horseback They're thirty miles off by this time  HASTINGS  Then all my hopes are over  SERVANT  Yes Sir Old Sir Charles is arrived He and the old gentleman of the house have been laughing at Mr Marlow's mistake this half hour They are coming this way  HASTINGS  Then I must not be seen So now to my fruitless appointment at the bottom of the garden This is about the time  Exit  Enter Sir CHARLES and HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Ha ha ha The peremptory tone in which be sent forth his sublime commands  Sir CHARLES  And the reserve with which I suppose he treated all your advances  HARDCASTLE  And yet he might have seen something in me above a common innkeeper too  Sir CHARLES  Yes Dick but he mistook you for an uncommon innkeeper ha ha ha  HARDCASTLE  Well I'm in too good spirits to think of any thing but joy Yes my dear friend this union of our families will make our personal friendships hereditary and though my daughter's fortune is but small  Sir CHARLES  Why Dick will you talk of fortune to me My son is possessed of more than a competence already and can want nothing but a good and virtuous girl to share his happiness and encrease it If they like each other as you say they do  HARDCASTLE  If man I tell you they do like each other My daughter as good as told me so  Sir CHARLES  But girls are apt to flatter themselves you know  HARDCASTLE  I saw him grasp her hand in the warmest manner myself and here he comes to put you out of your ifs I warrant him  Enter MARLOW  MARLOW  I come Sir once more to ask pardon for my strange conduct I can scarce reflect on my insolence without confusion  HARDCASTLE  Tut boy a trifle You take it too gravely An hour or two's laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again She'll never like you the worse for it  MARLOW  Sir I shall be always proud of her approbation  HARDCASTLE  Approbation is but a cold word Mr Marlow if I am not deceived you have something more than approbation thereabouts You take me  MARLOW  Really Sir I have not that happiness  HARDCASTLE  Come boy I'm an old fellow and know what's what as well as you that are younger I know what has past between you but mum  MARLOW  Sure Sir nothing has past between us but the most profound respect on my side and the most distant reserve on hers You don't think Sir that my impudence has been past upon all the rest of the family  HARDCASTLE  Impudence No I don't say thatnot quite imprudencethough girls like to be play'd with and rumpled a little too sometimes But she has told no tales I assure you  MARLOW  I never gave her the slightest cause  HARDCASTLE  Well well I like modesty in its place well enough But this is overacting young gentleman You may be open Your father and I will like you the better for it  MARLOW  May I die Sir if I ever  HARDCASTLE  I tell you she don't dislike you and as I'm sure you like her  MARLOW  Dear SirI protestSir  HARDCASTLE  I see no reason why you should not be joined as fast as the parson can tie you  MARLOW  But hear me Sir  HARDCASTLE  Your father approves the match I admire it every moment's delay will be doing mischief so  MARLOW  But why won't you hear me By all that's just and true I never gave Miss Hardcastle the slightest mark of my attachment or even the most distant hint to suspect me of affection We had but one interview and that was formal modest and uninteresting  HARDCASTLE  Aside  This fellow's formal modest impudence is beyond bearing  Sir CHARLES  And you never grasp'd her hand or made any protestations  MARLOW  As Heaven is my witness I came down in obedience to your commands I saw the lady without emotion and parted without reluctance I hope you'll exact no further proofs of my duty nor prevent me from leaving a house in which I suffer so many mortifications  Exit  Sir CHARLES  I'm astonished at the air of sincerity with which he parted  HARDCASTLE  And I'm astonish'd at the deliberate intrepidity of his assurance  Sir CHARLES  I dare pledge my life and honour upon his truth  HARDCASTLE  Here comes my daughter and I would stake my happiness upon her veracity  Enter Miss HARDCASTLE  HARDCASTLE  Kate come hither child Answer us sincerely and without reserve has Mr Marlow made you any professions of love and affection  Miss HARDCASTLE  The question is very abrupt Sir But since you require unreserved sincerity I think he has  HARDCASTLE  To Sir Charles  You see  Sir CHARLES  And pray madam have you and my son had more than one interview  Miss HARDCASTLE  Yes Sir several  HARDCASTLE  To Sir Charles  You see  Sir CHARLES  But did he profess any attachment  Miss HARDCASTLE  A lasting one  Sir CHARLES  Did he talk of love  Miss HARDCASTLE  Much Sir  Sir CHARLES  Amazing And all this formally  Miss HARDCASTLE  Formally  HARDCASTLE  Now my friend I hope you are satisfied  Sir CHARLES  And how did he behave madam  Miss HARDCASTLE  As most profest admirers do Said some civil things of my face talked much of his want of merit and the greatness of mine mentioned his heart gave a short tragedy speech and ended with pretended rapture  Sir CHARLES  Now I'm perfectly convinced indeed I know his conversation among women to be modest and submissive This forward canting ranting manner  by no means describes him and I am confident he never sate for the picture  Miss HARDCASTLE  Then what Sir if I should convince you to your face of my sincerity If you and my papa in about half an hour will place yourselves behind that screen you shall hear him declare his passion to me in person  Sir CHARLES  Agreed And if I find him what you describe all my happiness in him must have an end  Exit  Miss HARDCASTLE  And if you don't find him what I describeI fear my happiness must never have a beginning  Exeunt  SCENE changes to the Back of the Garden  Enter HASTINGS  HASTINGS  What an idiot am I to wait here for a fellow who probably takes a delight in mortifying me He never intended to be punctual and I'll wait no longer What do I see It is he and perhaps with news of my Constance  Enter TONY booted and spattered  HASTINGS  My honest 'squire I now find you a man of your word This looks like friendship  TONY  Aye I'm your friend and the best friend you have in the world if you knew but all This riding by night by the bye is cursedly tiresome It has shook me worse than the basket of a stagecoach  HASTINGS  But how where did you leave your fellow travellers Are they in safety Are they housed  TONY  Five and twenty miles in two hours and a half is no such bad driving The poor beasts have smoaked for it rabbet me but I'd rather ride forty miles after a fox than ten with such varment  HASTINGS  Well but where have you left the ladies I die with impatience  TONY  Left them Why where should I leave them but where I found them  HASTINGS  This is a riddle  TONY  Riddle me this then What's that goes round the house and round the house and never touches the house  HASTINGS  I'm still astray  TONY  Why that's it mon I have led them astray By jingo there's not a pond or slough within five miles of the place but they can tell the taste of  HASTINGS  Ha ha ha I understand you took them in a round while they supposed themselves going forward and so you have at last brought them home again  TONY  You shall hear I first took them down Featherbedlane where we stuck fast in the mud I then rattled them crack over the stones of Upanddown HillI then introduced them to the gibbet on Heavytree Heath and from that with a circumbendibus I fairly lodged them in the horsepond at the bottom of the garden  HASTINGS  But so accident I hope  TONY  No no Only mother is confoundedly frightened She thinks herself fortymiles off She's sick of the journey and the cattle can scarce crawl So if your own horses be ready you may whip off with coufin and I'll be bound that no soul here can budge a foot to follow you  HASTINGS  My dear friend how can I be gratesul  TONY  Aye now its dear friend noble 'squire Just now it was all idiot

Exit  Enter HASTINGS and Miss NEVILLE  HASTINGS  My dear Constance why will you deliberate thus If we delay a moment all is lost for ever Pluck up a little resolution and we shall soon be out of the reach of her malignity  Miss NEVILLE  I find it impossible My spirits are so sunk with the agitations I have suffered that I am unable to face any new danger Two or three years patience will at last crown us with happiness  HASTINGS  Such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy Let us fly my charmer Let us date our happiness from this very moment Perish fortune Love and content will encrease what we possess beyond a monarch's revenue Let me prevail  Miss NEVILLE  No Mr Hastings no Prudence once more comes to my relief and I will obey its dictates In the moment of passion fortune may be despised but it ever produces a lasting repentance I'm resolved to apply to Mr Hardcastle's compasion and justice for redress  HASTINGS  But though he had the will he has not the power to relieve you  Miss NEVILLE  But he has influence and upon that I am resolved to rely  HASTINGS  I have no hopes But since you persist I must reluctantly obey you  Exeunt  SCENE changes  Enter Sir CHARLES and Miss HARDCASTLE  Sir CHARLES  What a situation am I in If what you say appears I shall then find a guilty son If what he  says be true I shall then lose one that of all others I most wish'd for a daughter  Miss HARDCASTLE  I am proud of your approbation and to shew I merit it if you place yourselves as I directed you shall hear his explicit declaration But he comes  Sir CHARLES  I'll to your father and keep him to the appointment  Exit Sir  Charles  Enter MARLOW  MARLOW  Though prepar'd for setting out I come once more to take leave nor did I till this moment know the pain I feel in the separation  Miss HARDCASTLE  In her own natural manner  I believe these sufferings cannot be very great Sir which you can so easily remove A day or two longer perhaps might lessen your uneasiness by shewing the little value of what you now think proper to regret  MARLOW  Aside  This girl every moment improves upon me  To her  It must not be madam I have already trifled too long with my heart My very pride begins to submit to my passion The disparity of education and fortune the anger of a parent and the contempt of my equals begin to lose their  weight and nothing can restore me to myself but this painsul effort of resolution  Miss HARDCASTLE  Then go Sir I'll urge nothing more to detain you Though my family be as good as hers you came down to visit and my education I hope not inferior what are these advantages without equal affluence I must remain contented with the slight approbation of imputed merit I must have only the mockery of your addresses while all your serious aims are fixed on fortune  Enter HARDCASTLE and Sir CHARLES from behind  Sir CHARLES  Here behind this screen  HARDCASTLE  Aye aye make no noise I'll engage my Kate covers him with confusion at last  MARLOW  By Heavens madam fortune was ever my smallest consideration Your beauty at first caught my eye for who could see that without emotion But every moment that I converse with you steals in some new grace heightens the picture and gives it stronger expression What at first seem'd rustic plainness now appears resin'd simplicity What  seem'd forward assurance now strikes me as the result of courageous innocence and conscious virtue  Sir CHARLES  What can it mean He amazes me  HARDCASTLE  I told you how it would be Hush  MARLOW  I am now determined to stay madam and I have too good an opinion of my father's discernment when he sees you to doubt his approbation  Miss HARDCASTLE  No Mr Marlow I will not cannot detain you Do you think I could suffer a connexion in which there is the smallest room for repentance Do you think I would take the mean advantage of a transient passion to load you with confusion Do you think I could ever relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening yours  MARLOW  By all that's good I can have no happiness but what's in your power to grant me Nor shall I ever feel repentance but in not having seen your merits before I will stay even contrary to your wishes and though you should persist to shun me I will make my respectful assiduities atone for the levity of my past condust  Miss HARDCASTLE  Sir I must entreat you'll desist As our acquaintance began so let it end in indifference I  might have given an hour or two to levity but seriously Mr Marlow do you think I could ever submit to a connexion where I must appear mercenary and you imprudent do you think I could ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure admirer  MARLOW  Kneeling  Does this look like security Does this look like confidence No madam every moment that shews me your merit only serves to encrease my diffidence and confusion Here let me continue  Sir CHARLES  I can hold it no longer Charles Charles how hast thou deceived me Is this your indifference your uninteresting conversation  HARDCASTLE  Your cold contempt your formal interview What have you to say now  MARLOW  That I'm all amazement What can it mean  HARDCASTLE  It means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure That you can address a lady in private and deny it in public that you have one story for us and another for my daughter  MARLOW  Daughterthis lady your daughter  HARDCASTLE  Yes Sir my only daughter My Kate whose else should she be  MARLOW  Oh the devil  Miss HARDCASTLE  Yes Sir that very identical tall squinting lady you were pleased to take me for  curtesying  she that you addressed as the mild modest sentimental man of gravity and the bold forward agreeable Rattle of the ladies club ha ha ha  MARLOW  Zounds there's no bearing this it's worse than death  Miss HARDCASTLE  In which of your characters Sir will you give us leave to address you As the faultering gentleman with looks on the ground that speaks just to be heard and hates hypocrisy or the loud confident creature that keeps it up with Mrs Mantrap and old Miss Biddy Buckskin till three in the morning ha ha ha  MARLOW  O curse on my noisy head I never attempted to be impudent yet that I was not taken down I must be gone  HARDCASTLE  By the hand of my body but you shall not I see it was all a mistake and I am rejoiced to find it You shall not Sir I tell you I know she'll forgive you Won't you forgive him Kate We'll all forgive you Take courage man  They retire she tormenting him to the back scene  Enter Mrs HARDCASTLE TONY  Mrs HARDCASTLE  So so they're gone off Let them go I care not  HARDCASTLE  Who gone  Mrs HARDCASTLE  My dutiful niece and her gentleman Mr Hastings from town He who came down with our modest visitor here  Sir CHARLES  Who my honest George Hastings As worthy a fellow as lives and the girl could not have made a more prudent choice  HARDCASTLE  Then by the hand of my body I'm proud of the connexion  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Well if he has taken away the lady he has not taken her fortune that remains in this family to console us for her loss  HARDCASTLE  Sure Dorothy you would not be so mercenary  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Aye that's my affair not yours But you know if your son when of age refuses to marry his cousin her whole fortune is then at her own disposal  HARDCASTLE  Aye but he's not of age and she has not thought proper to wait for his refusal  Enter HASTINGS and Miss NEVILLE  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Aside  What returned so soon I begin not to like it  HASTINGS  To Hardcastle  For my late attempt to fly off with your niece let my present confusion be my punishment We are now come back to appeal from your justice to your humanity By her father's consent I first paid her my addresses and our passions were first founded in duty  Miss NEVILLE  Since his death I have been obliged to stoop to dissimulation to avoid oppression In an hour of levity I was ready even to give up my fortune to secure my choice But I'm now recover'd from the delusion and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a nearer connexion  Mrs HARDCASTLE  Pshaw pshaw this is all but the whining end of a modern novel  HARDCASTLE  Be it what it will I'm glad they're come back to reclaim their due Come hither Tony boy Do you refuse this lady's hand whom I now offer you  TONY  What signifies my refusing You know I can't refuse her till I'm of age father  HARDCASTLE  While I thought concealing your age boy was likely to conduce to your improvement I concurred with your mother's desire to keep it secret But since I find she turns it to a wrong use I must now declare you have been of age these three months  TONY  Of age I Am I of age father  HARDCASTLE  Above three months  TONY  Then you'll see the first use I'll make of my liberty  Taking Miss  Neville  's band  Witness all men by these presents that I Anthony Lumpkin esquire of BLANK place refuse you Constantia Neville spinster of no place at all for my true and lawful wife So Constance Neville may marry whom she pleases and Tony Lumpkin is his own man again  Sir CHARLES  O brave 'squire  HASTINGS  My worthy friend  Mrs HARDCASTLE  My undutiful offspring  MARLOW  Joy my dear George I give you joy sincerely And could I prevail upon my little tyrant here to be less arbitrary I should be the happiest man alive if you would return me the savour  HASTINGS  To Miss  Hardcastle    Come madam you are now driven to the very last scene of all your contrivances I know you like him I'm sure he loves yon and you must and shall have him  HARDCASTLE  Joining their hands  And I say so too And Mr Marlow if she makes as good a wife as she has a daughter I don't believe you'll ever repent your bargain So now to supper Tomorrow we shall gather all the poor of the parish about us and the mistakes of the night shall be crowned with a merry morning so boy take her and as you have been mistaken in the mistress my wish is that you may never be mistaken in the wife  EPILOGUE  BY DR GOLDSMITH  WELL having stoop'd to conquer with success  And gain'd a husband without aid from dress  Still as a barmaid I could wish it too  As I have conquer'd him to conquer you  And let me say for all your resolution  That pretty barmaids have done execution  Our life is all a play compos'd to please  " We have our exits and our entrances"  The first act shews the simple country maid  Harmless and young of every thing afraid  Blushes when hir'd and with unmeaning action  " I hopes as how to give you satisfaction"  Her second act displays a livelier scene  Th' unblushing barmaid of a country inn  Who whisks about the house at market caters  Talks loud coquets the guests and scolds the waiters  Next the scene shifts to town and there she soars  The chophouse toast of ogling  connoisieurs  On 'squires and cits she there displays her arts  And on the gridiron broils her lover's hearts  And as she smiles her triumphs to compleat  Even common councilmen forget to eat  The fourth act shews her wedded to the 'squire  And madam now begins to hold it higher  Pretends to taste at operas cries caro  And quits her Nancy Dawson for Che Faro  Doats upon dancing and in all her pride  Swims round the room the Heinell of Cheapside  Ogles and leers with artificial skill  Till having lost in age the power to kill  She sits all night at cards and ogles at spadille  Such through our lives the eventful history  The fifth and last act still remains for me  The barmaid now for your protection prays  Turns female Barrister and pleads for Bays  EPILOGUE  TO BE SPOKEN IN THE CHARACTER OF TONY LUMPKIN  This came too late to be spoken  BY J

Neville I renounce her  Offin a crackI'll carry big Bett Bouncer  Why should not I in the great world appear  I soon shall have a thousand pounds a year  No matter what a man may here inherit  In London'gad they have some regard to spirit  I see the horses prancing up the streets  And big Bett Bouncer bobs to all she meets  Then hoikes to jiggs and pastimes ev'ry night  Not to the playsthey say it a'n't polite  To Sadler'sWells perhaps or operas go  And once by chance to the roratorio  Thus here and there for ever up and down  We'll set the fashions too to half the town  And then at auctionsmoney ne'er regard  Buy pictures like the great ten pounds a yard  Zounds we shall make these London gentry say  We know what's damn'd genteel as well as they  FINIS
