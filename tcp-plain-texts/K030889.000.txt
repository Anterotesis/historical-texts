 ANTIENT and MODERN ITALY COMPARED Being the FIRST PART of LIBERTY A POEM  By Mr THOMSON  LONDON  inted for A MILLAR overagainst  St Clement's  Church in the  Strand  MDCCXXXV Price One Shilling  TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FREDERICK PRINCE of WALES  SIR  _WHEN I reflect upon that ready Condescension that preventing Generosity with which YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS received the following Poem under your Protection I can alone ascribe it to the Recommendation and Influence of the Subject In you the Cause and Concerns of Liberty have so  zealous a Patron as entitles whatever may have the least Tendency to promote them to the Distinction of your Favour And who can entertain this delightful Reflection without feeling a Pleasure far superior to that of the fondest Author and of which all true Lovers of their Country must participate To behold the noblest Dispositions of the Prince and of the Patriot united an overflowing Benevolence Generosity and Candour of Heart joined to an enlightened Zeal for Liberty an intimate Persuasion that on it depends the Happiness and Glory both of Kings and People to see these shining out in Public Virtues as they have hitherto smiled in all the Social Lights and Private Accomplishments of Life is a Prospect that cannot but inspire a general Sentiment of Satisfaction and Gladness more easy to be felt than expressed  IF the following Attempt to trace Liberty from the first Ages down to her excellent Establishment in GREAT BRITAIN can at all merit your Approbation  and prove an Entertainment to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS if it can in any Degree answer the Dignity of the Subject and of the Name under which I presume to shelter it I have my best Reward particularly as it affords me an Opportunity of declaring that I am with the greatest Zeal and Respect  SIR  YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S Most Obedient And most Devoted Servant  James Thomson  LIBERTY  PART I  _OMY lamented TALBOT while with Thee  The  Muse  gayrov'd the glad  Hesperian  Round  And drew th' inspiring Breath of Ancient Arts  Ah little thought she her returning Verse  Should sing our Darling Subject to thy  Shade  And does the Mystic Veil from mortal Beam  Involve those Eyes where every Virtue smil'd  And all the FATHER'S candid Spirit shone  The Light of Reason pure without a Cloud  Full of the generous Heart the mild Regard  Unblemish'd Honour uncorrupted Faith  And limpid Truth that looks the very Soul  But to the Death of mighty Nations turn'd  My Strain be there absorb'd the Private Tear  MUSING I lay warm from the sacred Walks  Where at each step Imagination burns  Ten thousand Wonders rowling in my thought  As the Great Scene of deathless deeds I tread  Tread the blest Ground by more than mortals trod  And see those Skies that breath'd the  Roman  Soul  Mean time widescatter'd round awful and hoar  Lies a vast Monument once glorious  Rome    The Tomb of Empire Ruins that efface  Whate'er of finish'd modern Pomp can boast  Of these Ideas full reposing Sense  In slumber sunk and Fancy's Magic hand  Led me anew o'er all the solemn Scene  Still in the Mind's pure eye more solemn drest  When strait methought the fair majestic POWER  Of LIBERTY appear'd Not as of old  Extended in her hand the Cap and Rod  Whose Slaveinlarging touch gave double life  But her bright Temples bound with  British  Oak  And Naval Honours nodded on her Brow  Sublime her Port Loose o'er her Shoulder flow'd  Her seagreen Robe with Constellations gay  An Island Goddess now and her high care  The Queen of Isles the Mistress of the Main  My heart beat filial transport at the sight  And as she mov'd to speak th' awaken'd  Muse  Listen'd intense A while she look'd around  With mournful eye the wellknown Ruins mark'd  And then her Sighs repressing thus began  Mine are these Wonders all thou see'st is mine  But ah how chang'd the falling poor Remains  Of what exalted once th'  Ausonian  Shore  Look back thro' time and from the gloom disclos'd  Painting my words behold the scatter'd Scene  The Great Republick see that glow'd sublime  With the mixt Freedom of a thousand States  Rais'd on the Thrones of Kings her Curule Chair  And by her Fasces aw'd the subject World  See busy Millions swarming all the Land  With Cities throng'd and teeming Culture high  For on her freeborn Sons then Nature smil'd  And pour'd the Plenty that belongs to Men  Behold the Country chearing Villas rise  In lively Prospect by the secret lapse  Of Brooks now lost and Streams renown'd in Song  In  Umbria  's closing Vales or on the brow  Of her brown Hills that breathe the scented gale  On  Baia  's viny coast where peaceful Seas  Fan'd by kind Zephirs ever kiss the shore  And Suns unclouded shine and purest Air  Or in the spacious Neighbourhood of  Rome    Farshining upwards to the  Sabine  Hills  To  Anio  's Roar and  Tibur  's Olive Shade  To where  Preneste  lifts her airy Brow  Or downwards spreading to the sunny shore  Wav'd from the main where  Alba  draws the Breeze  See distant Mountains leave their Vallies dry  And o'er the proud Arcade their Tribute pour  To lave Imperial  Rome  For ages laid  Deep massy firm diverging every way  From sea to sea her Public Roads behold  By various Nations trod and suppliant Kings  With Legions flaming or with Triumph green  Full in the Centre of these wondrous Works  While Tombs of Heroes consecrate the way  The Pride of Earth  Rome  in her Glory see  Behold her Demigods in Senate met  All Head to counsel and all Heart to act  The Commonweal inspiring every Tongue  With fervent Eloquence  unbrib'd  and  bold    Ere low  Corruption  taught the  Servile Herd  To know a  Master  's voice Astonish'd mark  Her Forum earnest popular and loud  In trembling wonder hush'd when the two  L J Brutus  and  Virginius  SIRES  As they the  Private Father  greatly quell'd  Stood up the  Public Fathers  of the State  See Justice judging there in Human Shape  Hark how with Freedom's voice it thunders high  Or in soft murmurs sinks to TULLY'S tongue  Her Tribes her Census see her Generous Troops  Whose Pay was Glory and whose best Reward  Free for their Country and for ME to die  Ere Mercenary Murder grew a Trade  Mark as the purple Triumph waves along  The highest Pomp and lowest Fall of Life  Her Festive Games the School of Heroes see  Her Circus ardent with contending Youth  Her Streets her Temples Palaces and Baths  Full of fair Forms of Beauty's eldest born  And of a Race by Plastic Virtue mark'd  While Sculpture lives around and  Asian  Hills  Lend their best Stores to heave the pillar'd Dome  All that to  Roman  Grandeur the soft Touch  Of  Grecian  Art can join But Language fails  To paint this Sun this Center of Mankind  Where every Virtue Glory Treasure Art  Attracted strong in heighten'd lustre met  Need I the Contrast mark unjoyous View  A Land in all in Government and Arts  In Virtue Genius Heaven and Earth revers'd  Who but these farfam'd Ruins to behold  Proofs of a People whose heroic Aims  Soar'd far above the little selfish sphere  Of doubting modern Life who but inflam'd  With Classic Zeal the consecrated Scenes  Of Men and Deeds to trace the Wonder Theme  And Model of Mankind unhappy Land  Would trust thy Wilds and Cities loose of sway  Are these the Vales that once exulting States  In their warm bosom fed The Mountains these  On whose highblooming sides my Sons of old  I bred to Glory These dejected Towns  Sordid and mean where Life can scarce subsist  The Scenes of Antient Opulence and Pomp  Come by whatever  Sacred Name  disguis'd  OPPRESSION come and in thy works rejoice  See Nature's richest Plains to putrid Fens  Turn'd by thy Rage From their unchearful bounds  See raz'd th' enliv'ning Village Farm and Seat  First Rural Toil by thy rapacious hand  Robb'd of his poor Reward resign'd the Plow  And now he dares not turn the noxious Glebe  'Tis thine intire The lonely Swain himself  Who loves at large along the grassy Downs  His flocks to pasture Thine abhorrent flies  Far as the sickening Eye can sweep around  'Tis all one Desart desolate and grey  Graz'd by the sullen Bufalo alone  And where the rank unventilated Growth  Of rotting Ages taints the passing Gale  Beneath the baleful Blast the City pines  Or sinks infeebl'd or infected burns  Beneath it mourns the solitary Road  Roll'd in rude Mazes o'er th' abandon'd Waste  While Antient Ways ingulph'd are seen no more  Such thy dire Plains thou  SelfDestroyer  Foe  To Humankind Thy Mountains too profuse  Where savage Nature blooms seem their sad plaint  To raise against thy desolating Rod  There on the breezy Brow where thriving States  And famous Cities once to the pleas'd Sun  Far other Scenes of rising Culture spread  Pale shine thy ragged Towns Neglected round  Each Harvest pines the livid lean Produce  Of heartless Labour while thy hated Joys  Not proper Pleasure lift the lazy hand  Better to sink in Sloth the Woes of life  Than wake their rage with unavailing Toil  Hence drooping Art almost to Nature leaves  The rude unguided Year Thin wave the Gifts  Of yellow  Ceres  thin the radiant Blush  Of Orchard reddens in the warmest ray  To weedy wildness run no Rural Wealth  Such as Dictators fed the Garden pours  Crude the wild Olive flows and foul the Vine  Nor Juice  Coecubian  nor  Falernian  more  Streams Life and Joy save in the  Muse  's bowl  Unseconded by Art the spinning Race  Draw the bright thread in vain and idly toil  In vain forlorn in wilds the Citron blows  And flowering Plants perfume the desart gale  Thro' the vile hedge the tender Myrtle twines  Inglorious droops the Laurel dead to Song  And long a stranger to the Heroe's brow  Nor half thy Triumph this cast from brute Fields  Into the Haunts of Men thy ruthless eye  There buxom Plenty never turns her horn  The Grace and Virtue of exterior Life  No clean Convenience reigns even Sleep itself  Least delicate of Powers reluctant there  Lays on the Bed impure his heavy head  Thy horrid Walk dead empty unadorn'd  See Streets whose Echos never know the voice  Of chearful Hurry Commerce manytongue'd  And Art mechanic at his various task  Fervent employ'd Mark the desponding Race  Of Occupation void as void of Hope  Hope the glad Ray glanc'd from ETERNAL GOOD  That Life enlivens and exalts it's Powers  With views of FortuneMadness all to them  By Thee relentless seiz'd their better Joys  To the soft aid of cordial Airs they fly  A kind Oblivion breathing o'er their Woes  And Love and Music melt their Souls away  From feeble  Justice  see how rash  Revenge    Trembling the Ballance snatches and her Sword  Fearful himself to venal Ruffians gives  See where GOD'S Altar nursing Murder stands  With the red touch of dark Assassins stain'd  But chief let  Rome  the mighty City speak  The fullexerted Genius of thy Reign  Behold Her rise amid the lifeless Waste  Expiring Nature all corrupted round  While the lone  Tyber  thro' the desart Shore  Winds his waste stores and sullen sweeps along  Patch'd from my Fragments in unsolid Pomp  Mark how the Temple glares and artful drest  Amusive draws the superstitious Train  Mark how the Palace lifts a lying front  Concealing often in magnific Jail  Proud Want a deep unanimated Gloom  And often joining to the drear abode  Of Misery whose melancholy walls  Seem its voracious Grandeur to reproach  Within the City Bounds the Desart see  See the rank Vine o'er subterranean roofs  Indecent spread beneath whose fretted gold  It once exulting flow'd The People mark  Matchless while fir'd by me to Public Good  Inexorably firm just generous brave  Afraid of nothing but unworthy Life  Elate with Glory an Heroic Soul  Known to the Vulgar Breast behold them now  A thin despairing Number all subdu'd  The Slaves of Slaves by Superstition fool'd  By Vice unman'd and a licentious Rule  In Guile ingenious and in Murder brave  Such in one Land beneath the same fair Clime  Thy Sons OPPRESSION are and such were MINE  Even with thy labour'd  State  for whose vain show  Deluded Thousands starve all agebegrim'd  Torn robb'd and scatter'd in unnumber'd Sacks  And by the Tempest of two thousand Years  Continual shaken let my  Ruins  vie  These Roads that yet the  Roman  hand assert  Beyond the weak repair of modern Toil  These fractur'd Arches that the chiding Stream  No more delighted hear these rich Remains  Of Marbles now unknown where shines imbib'd  Each parent ray these massy Columns hew'd  From  Africk  's farthest shore one Granite all  These Obelisks hightowering to the Sky  Mysterious mark'd with dark  Egyptian  Lore  These endless Wonders that this  Via Sacra  Sacred Way  Illumine still and consecrate to Fame  These Fountains Vases Urns and Statues charg'd  With the fine stores of Artcompleating  Greece  From these too drawn mine is thy every Boast  Thy  MANGELO BUONAROTI PALLADIO and RAPHAEL D'URBINO the three great modern Masters in Sculpture Architecture and Painting  BUONAROTIS thy PALLADIOS mine  And mine the fair Designs that RAPHAEL'S soul  O'er the live canvass emanating breath'd  What would you say ye Conquerors of Earth  Ye  Romans  could you raise the laurel'd Head  Could you the Country see with Seas of blood  And the dread Toil of ages won so dear  Your Pride your Triumph your supreme Delight  For whose Defence oft in the doubtful hour  You rush'd with rapture down the gulph of Fate  Of Death ambitious till by awful Deeds  Virtues and Courage that amaze Mankind  The Queen of Nations rose possest of all  That Nature Art and Glory could bestow  What would you say deep in the last Abyss  Of Slavery Vice and unambitious Want  Thus to behold her sunk Your crowded Plains  Void of their Cities unadorn'd your Hills  Ungrac'd your Lakes your Ports to Ships unknown  Your lawless Floods and your abandon'd Streams  These could you know these could you love again  Thy  Tibur  HORACE could it now inspire  Content Poetic Ease and Rural Joy  Soon bursting into Song while thro' the Groves  Of headlong  Anio  dashing to the Vale  In many a tortur'd Stream you mus'd along  Tusculum  is reckoned to have stood at a Place now called  Grotta Ferrata  a Convent of Monks  Yon wild retreat where Superstition dreams  Could TULLY you your  Tusculum  believe  And could you deem yon naked Hills that form  Fam'd in old Song the Shipforsaken  The Bay of  Mola  anciently  Formiae  into which HOMER brings ULYSSES and his Companions Near  Formiae  CICERO had a Villa  Bay  Your  Formian  Shore Once the Delight of Earth  Where Art and Nature eversmiling join'd  On the gay Land to lavish all their Stores  How chang'd how vacant VIRGIL wide around  Would now your  Naples  seem Disaster'd less  By black  Vesuvius  thundering o'er the Coast  His midnight Earthquakes and his mining Fires  Than by Despotic Rage that inward gnaws  A native Foe a foreign tears without  First from your flatter'd CAESARS This begun  Till houseless spreads at last the  Campagna selice  adjoining to  Capua  Syren Plain  That the dire Soul of HANNIBAL disarm'd  And wrapt in Weeds the  The Coast of  Baia  which was formerly adorned with the Works mentioned in the following Lines and where amidst many magnificent Ruins those of a Temple erected to  Venus  are still to be seen  Shore of  Venus  lies  There  Baia  sees no more the joyous Throng  Her banks all beaming with the Pride of  Rome  No generous Vines now bask along the Hills  Where sport the Breezes of the  Tyrrhene  main  With Baths and Temples mixt no Villas rise  Nor Artsustain'd amid reluctant Waves  Draw the cool murmurs of the breathing Deep  No spreading Ports their sacred Arms extend  No mighty Moles the big intrusive Storm  From the calm Station roll resounding back  An almost total Desolation sits  A dreary Stillness sad'ning o'er the Coast  All along this Coast the antient  Romans  had their Winter retreats and several populous Cities stood  Where when soft Suns and tepid Winters rose  Rejoicing Crowds inhal'd the balm of Peace  Where city'd Hill to Hill reflected blaze  And where with  Ceres    Bacchus  wont to hold  A genial Strife Her youthful Form robust  Even Nature yields by Fire and Earthquake rent  Whole stately Cities in the dark Abrupt  Swallow'd at once or vile in rubbish laid  A nest for Serpents from the red Abyss  New Hills explosive thrown the  Lucrine  Lake  A reedy Pool and all to  Cuma  's Point  The Sea recovering his usurp'd Domain  And pour'd triumphant o'er the bury'd Dome  Hence BRITAIN learn my bestestablish'd last  And more than GREECE or ROME my steady Reign  The Land where  King  and  People  equal bound  By guardian Laws my fullest Blessings flow  And where my jealous unsubmitting Soul  The dread of Tyrants burns in every breast  Learn hence if such the miserable fate  Of an heroic Race the Masters once  Of Humankind what when depriv'd of ME  How grievous must be thine In spite of Climes  Whose Sunenliven'd  Aether  wakes the Soul  To higher Powers in spite of happy Soils  That but by Labour's slightest aid impell'd  With Treasures teem to thy cold Clime unknown  If there desponding fail the common Arts  And sustenance of life could Life itself  Or heartconsum'd a Tyrant's rotten Pomp  Subsist with thee Against depressing Skies  Join'd to fullspread Oppression's cloudy Brow  How could thy Spirits hold where Vigour find  Forc'd Fruits to tear from their unnative Soil  Or every Harvest storing in thy Ports  Profuse of all to plow the dreadful Wave  Here paus'd the GODDESS By the Pause assur'd  In trembling accents thus I mov'd my Prayer  "Oh first and most benevolent of Powers  "Come from eternal Splendors here on Earth  "Against despotic Pride and Rage and Lust  "To shield Mankind to raise them to assert  "The native Rights and Honour of their Race  "Teach me thy lowest Subject but in Zeal  "Yielding to none the PROGRESS OF THY REIGN▪  "And with a Strain from THEE enrich the  Muse  "For thy proud Slave alone her Patron Thou  "And great Inspirer be then will she joy  "Tho' narrow Life her Lot and Private Shade  "And when her  Venal Voice  she barters vile  "Or to thy open or thy secret Foes  "May ne'er those sacred Raptures touch her more  "By slavish Hearts unfelt and may her Song  "Sink in oblivion with the nameless Crew  "Vermin of State to thy o'erflowing Light  "That owe their Being yet betray thy Cause"  Then condescending kind the HEAVENLY POWER  Return'd"What here suggested by the Scene  "I slight unfold record and sing at home  "In that blest Isle where so we Spirits move  "With one quick effort of my Will I am  "There Truth  unlicens'd  walks even Kings themselves  "Invite her forth the Monarchs of the Free  "By that best Glory pierc'd that Godlike Joy  "That gay Security that Pride of Rule  "When Men not Slaves when allperforming Love  "Not sluggish Hate and faithless Fear obey  "Fix'd on my Rock there an Indulgent Race  "O'er BRITONS wield the Scepter of the Heart  "And mixing Worth with Worth the ROYAL PAIR  "To steady Justice yielding Goodness join  "Nor sets the Prospect in this pleasing view  "While there to finish what his Sires began  "A PRINCE behold for ME who burns sincere  "Even with a Subject's Zeal He my great Work  "Will Parentlike sustain and added give  "The Touch the  Graces  and the  Muses  owe  "For BRITAIN'S Glory swells his panting Breast  "And  Antient Arts  He emulous revolves  "His Pride to let the smiling Heart abroad  "Thro' Clouds of Pomp that but conceal the Man  "To please his Pleasure Bounty his Delight  "And all the Soul of TITUS dwells in Him"  Hail glorious Theme But how alas shall Verse  From the crude Stores of mortal Language drawn  How faint and tedious sing what piercing deep  The GODDESS flash'd at once upon my Soul  For clear Precision all the Tongue of Gods  Is Harmony itself to every Ear  Familiar known like Light to every Eye  Mean time disclosing Ages as She spoke  In dread Succession pour'd their Empires forth  Scene after Scene the Human Drama spread  And still th'embody'd Picture rush'd to sight  Oh THOU to whom the  Muses  owe their flame  Who bid'st beneath the Pole  Parnassus  rise  And  Hippocrenè  flow with thy bold Ease  The striking Force the Lightning of thy Thought  And thy strong Phrase that rowls profound and clear  Oh gracious GODDESS reinspire my Song  While I to nobler than
