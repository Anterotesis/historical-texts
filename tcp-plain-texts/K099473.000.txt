partly from the  Peripatetic Sect  they were brought first into  Britain  by  Julius Cesar  and finding it a Land of Plenty they wisely resolv'd never to go Home again Their Doctrines are Amphibious and compos'd  Party per Pale  of the two Sects beforemention'd from the  Peripatetics  they derive their Principle  of Walking as a proper Method to digest a Meal or create an Appetite from the  Epicureans  they maintain that all Pleasures are comprehended in good Eating and Drinking And so readily were their Opinions embrac'd that every Day produc'd many Proselytes and their Numbers have from Age to Age increas'd prodigiously insomuch that our whole Island is overrun with them at present Eating and Drinking are become so Customary among us that we seem to have entirely forgot and laid aside the old Fashion of Fasting Instead of having Wine sold at Apothecaries Shops as formerly every Street has two or three Taverns in it least these DumplingEaters should faint by the Way nay so zealous are they in the Cause of  Bacchus  that one of the Chief among 'em has made a Vow never to say his Prayers 'till he has a Tavern  of his own  in every Street in  London  and in every MarketTown in  England  What may we then in Time expect Since by insensible Degrees their Society is become so numerous and formidable that they are without Number other Bodies have their Meetings but where can the DumplingEaters assemble what Place large enough to contain 'em The  Bank India  and  SouthSea  Companies have their General Courts the  FreeMasons  and the  Gormogons  their Chapters nay our Friends  the  Quakers  have their Yearly Meetings And who would imagine any of these should be DumplingEaters But thus it is the DumplingEating Doctrine has so far prevail'd among 'em that they eat not only Dumplings but  Puddings  and those in no small Quantities  The Dumpling is indeed of more antient Institution and of  Foreign  Origin but alas what were those Dumplings nothing but a few Lentils sodden together moisten'd and cemented with a little seeth'd Fat not much unlike our Gritt or Oatmeal Pudding yet were they of such Esteem among the ancient  Romans  that a Statue was erected to  Fulvius Agricola  the first Inventor of these Lentil Dumplings How unlike the Gratitude shewn by the Publick to our Modern Projectors  The  Romans  tho' our Conquerors found themselves much outdone in Dumplings by our Forefathers the  Roman  Dumplings were no more to compare to those made by the  Britons  than a StoneDumpling is to a Marrow Pudding tho' indeed the  British  Dumpling at that time was little better than what we call a StoneDumpling being no thing else but Flour and Water But every Generation growing wiser and wiser the  Project was improv'd and Dumpling grew to be Pudding One Projector found Milk better than Water another introduc'd Butter some added Marrow others Plumbs and some found out the Use of Sugar so that to speak Truth we know not where to fix the Genealogy or Chronology of any of these Pudding Projectors to the Reproach of our Historians who eat so much Pudding yet have been so Ungrateful to the first Professors of this most noble Science as not to find 'em a Place in History  The Invention of Eggs was merely accidental two or three of which having casually roll'd from off a Shelf into a Pudding which a good Wife was making she found herself under a Necessity either of throwing away her Pudding or letting the Eggs remain but concluding from the innocent Quality of the Eggs that they would do no Hurt if they did no Good She wisely jumbl'd 'em all together after having carefully pick'd out the Shells the Consequence is easily imagined the Pudding became a Pudding of Puddings and the Use of Eggs from thence took its Date The Woman was sent for to Court to make Puddings for King  John  who then sway'd the Scepter and gain'd such Favour that she was the making of her whole Family I cannot conclude  this Paragraph without owning I receiv'd this important Part of the History of Pudding from old Mr  Lawrence  of  WilsdenGreen  the greatest Antiquary of the present Age  From that Time the  English  became so famous for Puddings that they are call'd PuddingEaters all over the World to this Day  At her Demise her Son was taken into Favour and made the King's chief Cook and so great was his Fame for Puddings that he was call'd  Jack Pudding  all over the Kingdom tho' in Truth his real Name was  John Barnes  as by the Records of the Kitchen you will find This  John Barnes  or  JackPudding  call him which you please the  French  have it  Jean Boudin  for his Fame had reached  France  whose King would have given the World to have had our  Jack  for his PuddingMaker This  Jack Pudding  I say became yet a greater Favourite than his Mother insomuch that he had the King's Ear as well as his Mouth at Command for the King you must know was a mighty Lover of Pudding and  Jack  fitted him to a Hair he knew how to make the most of a Pudding no Pudding came amiss to him he would make a Pudding  out of a Flintstone comparatively speaking It is needless to enumerate the many sorts of Pudding he made such as Plain Pudding Plumb Pudding Marrow Pudding Oatmeal Pudding Carrot Pudding Saucesage Pudding Bread Pudding Flower Pudding Suet Pudding and in short every Pudding but Quaking Pudding which was solely invented by and took its Name from our Good Friends of the  Bull and Mouth  before mentioned notwithstanding the many Pretenders to that Projection  But what rais'd our Hero most in the Esteem of this Puddingeating Monarch was his Second Edition of Pudding he being the first that ever invented the Art of Broiling Puddings which he did to such Perfection and so much to the King's likeing who had a mortal Aversion to Cold Pudding that he thereupon instituted him Knight of the Gridiron and gave him a Gridiron of Gold the Ensign of that Order which he always wore as a Mark of his Sovereign's Favour in short  Jack Pudding  or Sir  John  grew to be all in all with good King  John  he did nothing without him they were Finger and Glove and if we may believe Tradition our very good Friend had no small Hand in the  Magna Charta  If so how much are all  Englishmen  indebted  to him in what Repute ought the Order of the Gridiron to be which was instituted to do Honour to this Wonderful Man But alas how soon is Merit forgot how impudently do the Vulgar turn the most serious Things into Ridicule and mock the most solemn Trophies of Honour for now every Fool at a Fair or Zany at a Mountebank's Stage is call'd  Jack Pudding  has a Gridiron at his Back and a great Pair of Spectacles at his Buttocks to ridicule the most noble Order of the Gridiron But their Spectacles is a most ungrateful Reflection on the Memory of that great Man whose indefatigable Application to his Business and deep Study in that occult Science rendred him Poreblind to remedy which Misfortune he had always a 'Squire follow'd him bearing a huge Pair of Spectacles to saddle his Honour's Nose and supply his muchlamented Defect of Sight But whether such an Unhappiness did not deserve rather Pity than Ridicule I leave to the Determination of all good Christians I cannot but say it raises my Indignation when I see these Paunchgutted Fellows usurping the Title and Atchievements of my dear Sir  John  whose Memory I so much venerate I cannot always contain my self I remember to my Cost I once carry'd my Resentment a little  farther than ordinary in furiously assaulting one of those Rascals I tore the Gridiron from his Back and the Spectacles from his Ae for which I was Apprehended carried to Pyepowder Court and by that tremendous Bench sentenc'd to most severe Pains and Penalties  This has indeed a little tam'd me insomuch that  I  keep my Fingers to my self but at the same time let my Tongue run like a Devil Forbear vile Miscreants cry I wheree'er I meet these Wretches forbear to ascribe to your selves the Name and Honours of Sir  John Pudding  content your selves with being  Zanies PickledHerrings Punchionellos  but dare not scandalize the noble Name of  Pudding  Nor can I notwithstanding the Clamours and Ill Usage of the Vulgar refrain bearing my Testimony against this manifest piece of Injustice  What Pity it is therefore so noble an Order should be lost or at least neglected We have had no Account of the real Knights os the Gridiron since they appeared under the fictitious Name of the  KitKat Club  In their Possession was the very Gridiron of Gold worn by Sir  John  himself which Identical Gridiron dignified the Breast  of the most ingenious Mr  Richard Estcourt  that excellent Physician and Comedian who was President of that Noble Society  Quis talia fando temperet à Lachrymis  What is become of the Gridiron or of the Remains of that excellent Body of Men Time will I hope discover The World I believe must for such Discoveries be obliged to my very good Friend  J T  Esq  who had the Honour to be Doorkeeper to that Honourable Assembly  But to return to Sir  John  The more his Wit engaged the King the more his Grandeur alarm'd his Enemies who encreas'd with his Honours Not but the Courtiers caress'd him to a Man as the first who had brought Dumplingeating to Perfection King  John  himself lov'd him entirely being of  Cesar  's Mind that is he had a natural Antipathy against Meagre Herringgutted Wretches he lov'd only  Fatheaded Men and such who slept o' Nights  and of such was his whole Court compos'd Now it was Sir  John  's Method every  Sunday  Morning to give the Courtiers a Breakfast which Breakfast was every Man his Dumpling and Cup of Wine for you must know he  was Yeoman of the WineCellar at the same time  This was a great Eyesore and Heartburning to some Lubberly Abbots who loung'd about the Court they took it in great Dudgeon they were not Invited and stuck so close to his Skirts that they never rested 'till they Outed him They told the King who was naturally very Hasty that Sir  John  madeaway with his Wine and feasted his Paramours at his Expence and not only so but that they were forming a Design against his Life which they in Conscience ought to discover That Sir  John  was not only an Heretic but an Heathen nay worse they fear'd he was a Witch and that he had bewitcht His Majesty into that unaccountable Fondness for a  PuddingMaker  They assur'd the King That on a  Sunday  Morning instead of being at Mattins he and his Trigrimates got together Humjum all snug and perform'd many Hellish and Diabolical Ceremonies In short they made the King believe that the Moon was made of GreenCheese And to shew how the Innocent may be Bely'd and the best Intentions misrepresented they told the King That He and his Associates offer'd Sacrifices to  Ceres  When alas it was only the Dumplings they eat  The Butter which was melted and pour'd over them these vile Miscreants call'd  Libations  And the friendly Compotations of our Dumplingeaters were call'd  Bacchanalian Rites  Two or three among 'em being sweettooth'd wou'd strew a little Sugar over their Dumplings this was represented as an  Heathenish Offering  In short not one Action of theirs but what these Rascally Abbots made Criminal and never let the King alone 'till poor Sir  John  was Discarded Not but the King did it with the greatest Reluctance but they had made it a Religious Concern and he cou'd not get off on't  But mark the Consequence The King never enjoy'd himself after nor was it long before he was poison'd by a Monk at  Swineshead  Abbey Then too late he saw his Error then he lamented the Loss of Sir  John  and in his latest Moments wou'd cry out Oh that I had never parted from my dear  Jack Pudding  Wou'd I had never left off Pudding and Dumpling I then had never been thus basely Poison'd never thus treacherously sent out of the WorldThus did this good King lament But alas to no Purpose the Priest had given him his Bane and Complaints were ineffectual  Sir  John  in the mean time had retir'd into  Norfolk  where his diffusive Knowledge extended it self for the Good of the County in general and from that very Cause  Norfolk  has ever since been so famous for Dumplings He lamented the King's Death to his very last and was so cautious of being poison'd by the Priests that he never touch'd a Wafer to the Day of his Death And had it not been that some of the lessdesigning part of the Clergy were his intimate Friends and eat daily of his Dumplings he had doubtless been Madeaway with out they stood in the Gap for him for the sake of his Dumplings knowing that when Sir  John  was gone they should never have the like again  But our facetious Knight was too free of his Talk to be long secure for a Hole was pick'd in his Coat in the succeeding Reign and poor Sir  John  had all his Goods and Chattels forfeited to the King's Use It was then time for him to bestir himself and away to Court he goes to recover his Lands  c  not doubting but he had Friends there sufficient to carry his Cause  But alas how was he mistaken not a Soul there knew him the very Porters  used him rudely In vain did he seek for Access to the King to vindicate his Conduct In vain did he claim Acquaintance with the Lords of the Court and reap up old Civilities to remind 'em of former Kindness the Pudding was eat the Obligation was over Which made Sir  John  compose that excellent Proverb  Not a word of the Pudding  And finding all Means ineffectual he left the Court in a great Pet yet not without passing a severe Joke upon 'em in his way which was this He sent a Pudding to the King's Table under the Name of a  CourtPudding  or  PromisePudding  This Pudding he did not fail to set off with large Encomiums assuring the King That therein he wou'd find an Hieroglyphical Definition of Courtiers Promises and Friendship  This caused some Speculation and the King's Physician debarr'd the King from tasting the Pudding not knowing but that Sir  John  had poison'd it  But how great a Fit of Laughter ensu'd may be easily guess'd when the Pudding was cut up it prov'd only a large Bladder just clos'd over with Paste The Bladder was full of Wind and nothing else excepting these Verses written in a Roll of Paper  and put in as is suppos'd before the Bladder was blown full  As Wynde in a Bladdere ypent  is Lordings promyse and serment  sain what hem lust withouten drede  they bene so double in her falshede  For they in heart can think ene thing  and sain another in her speaking  and what was sweet and apparent  is smoterlich and eke yshent  and when of service you have nede  pardie he will not rew nor rede  but when the Symnel it is eten  her curtesse is all foryetten  This Adventure met with various Constructions from those at Table Some Laugh'd others Frown'd But the King took the Joke by the right End and Laugh'd outright  The Verses tho' but scurvy ones in themselves yet in those Days pass'd for tolerable Nay the King was mightily pleas'd with 'em and play'd 'em off on his Courtiers as Occasion serv'd he wou'd stop 'em short in the middle of a flattering Harangue and cry  Not a Word of the Pudding  This wou'd daunt and mortify 'em to the last degree they curs'd Sir  John  a thousand times over for the Proverb's sake but to  no Purpose for the King gave him a private Hearing In which he so well satisfy'd His Majesty of his Innocence and Integrity that all his Lands were restor'd The King wou'd have put him in his old Post but he modestly declin'd it but at the same time presented His Majesty with a Book of most excellent Receipts for all kinds of Puddings Which Book His Majesty receiv'd with all imaginable Kindness and kept it among his greatest Rarities  But yet as the best Instructions tho' never so strictly follow'd may not be always as successfully executed so not one of the King's Cooks cou'd make a Pudding like Sir  John  nay tho' he made a Pudding before their Eyes yet they out of the very same Materials could not do the like Which made his old Friends the Monks attribute it to Witchcraft and it was currently reported the Devil was his Helper But good King  Harry  was not to be fobb'd off so the Pudding was good it sate very well on his Stomach and he eat very savourly without the least Remorse of Conscience  In short Sir  John  grew in Favour in spite of their Teeth The King lov'd a merry Joke and Sir  John  had always  his Budget full of Punns Connundrums and Carrawitchets not to forget the Quibbles and Flyflaps he play'd against his Adversaries at which the King has laugh'd 'till his Sides crackt  Sir  John  tho' he was no very great Scholar yet had a happy way of Expressing himself He was a Man of the most Engaging Address and never fail'd to draw Attention Plenty and GoodNature smil'd in his Face his Muscles were never distorted with Anger or Contemplation but an eternal Smile drew up the Corners of his Mouth his very Eyes laugh'd and as for his Chin it was threedouble adown which hung a goodly Wheycolour'd Beard shining with the Drippings of his Luxury for you must knew he was a great Epicure and had a very Sensible Mouth he thought nothing toogood for himself all his Care was for his Belly and his Palate was so exquisite that it was the perfect Standard of Tasting So that to him we owe all that is elegant in Eating For Pudding was not his only Talent he was a great Virtuoso in all manner of Eatables and tho' he might come short of  Lambert  for ConfectionaryNiceties yet was he not inferiour to  Brawnd Lebec Pede  or any other great Masters of Cookery he could toss up a Fricassée as well as a Pancake  And most of the Kickshaws now in vogue are but his Inventions with other Names for what we call  Fricassées  he call'd  Pancakes  as a Pancake of Chickens a Pancake of Rabbets  c  Nay the  French  call a Pudding an  English  Fricassée to this Day  We value our selves mightily for Roasting a Hare with a Pudding in its Belly when alas he has roasted an Ox with a Pudding in his Belly There was no Man like him for Invention and Contrivance And then for Execution he spar'd no Labour and Pains to compass his magnanimous Designs  O wou'd to Heav'n this little Attempt of Mine may stir up some  Puddingheaded Antiquary  to dig his Way through all the mouldy Records of Antiquity and bring to Light the Noble Actions of Sir  John  It will not then be long before we see him on the Stage Sir  John Falstaffe  then will be a Shrimp to Sir  John Pudding  when rais'd from Oblivion and reanimated by the AllInvigorating Pen of the WellFed WellRead WellPay'd  C J  Esq  Nor wou'd this be all for the PastryCooks wou'd from the Hands of an eminent Physician and Poet receive whole Loads of  Memorandums to remind 'em of the Gratitude due to Sir  John  's Memory  On such a Subject I hope to see Sir  Richard  Outdo himself Nor  Arthur  nor  Eliza  shall with Sir  John  compare There is not so much differenee between a Telescope and a PowderPuff a HoopPettyCoat and a FarthingCandle a BirchBroom and a DiamondRing as there will be between the former Writings of this pair of Poets and their Lucubrations on this Head  Nor will it stop here The  Opera  Composers shall have t'other Contest which shall best singforth his Praises Sorry am I that  Nicolino  is not here he would have made an excellent Sir  John  But  Senesino  being blown up after the manner that Butchers blow Calves may do well enough From thence the Painters and Printsellers shall retail his goodly Phiz and what  Sacheverel  was shall Sir  John Pudding  be his Head shall hang Elate on every Sign his Fame shall ring in every Street and  Cluer  's Press shall teem with Ballads to his Praise This would be but Honour this would be but Gratitude from a Generation so much indebted to so Great a Man  But how much do we deviate from Honour and Gratitude when we put other Names to his Inventions and call 'em our own What is a Tart a Pie or a Pasty but Meat or Fruit enclos'd in a Wall or Covering of Pudding What is a Cake but a Bak'd Pudding or a  ChristmasPie  but a Minc'dMeatPudding As for Cheesecakes Custards Tansies they are manifest Puddings and all of Sir  John  's own Contrivance for Custard is as old if not older than  Magna Charta  In short Pudding is of the greatest Dignity and Antiquity Bread it self which is the very Staff of Life is properly speaking a Bak'd WheatPudding  To the Satchel which is the PuddingBag of Ingenuity we are indebted for the greatest Men in Church and State All Arts and Sciences owe their Original to Pudding or Dumpling What is a BagPipe the Mother of all Music but a Pudding of Harmony And what is Music it self but a Palatable Cookery of Sounds To little Puddings or Bladders of Colours we owe all the choice Originals of the Greatest Painters And indeed what is Painting but a wellspread Pudding or Cookery of Colours  The Head of Man is like a Pudding And whence have all Rhimes Poems Plots and Inventions sprang but from that same Pudding What is Poetry but a Pudding of Words The Physicians tho' they cry out so much against Cooks and Cookery yet are but Cooks themselves with this difference only the Cooks Pudding lengthens Life the Physicians shortens it So that we Live and Die by Pudding For what is a Clyster but a BagPudding a Pill but a Dumpling or a Bolus but a Tansy tho' not altogether so Toothsome In a word Physick is only a Puddingizing or Cookery of Drugs The Law is but a Cookery of Quibbles and Contentions  The Cat run away

Ingredient proportion'd to the greatest Nicety or it will never go down  The Universe it self is but a Pudding of Elements Empires Kingdoms States and Republicks are but Puddings of People differently made up The Celestial and Terrestrial Orbs are decypher'd to us by a pair of Globes or Mathematical Puddings  The Success of War and Fate of Monarchies are entirely dependant on Puddings and Dumplings For what else are CannonBalls but Military Puddings or Bullets but Dumplings only with this difference they do not sit so well on the Stomach as a good MarrowPudding or BreadPudding  In short There is nothing valuable in Nature but what more or less has an Allusion to Pudding or Dumpling Why then should they be held in Disesteem Why should DumplingEating be ridicul'd or DumplingEaters derided Is it not Pleasant and Profitable Is it not Ancient and Honourable Kings Princes and Potentates have in all Ages been Lovers of Pudding Is it not therefore  of Royal Authority Popes Cardinals Bishops Priests and Deacons have Time out of Mind been great PuddingEaters Is it not therefore a Holy and Religious Institution Philosophers Poets and Learned Men in all Faculties Judges PrivyCouncellors and Members of both Houses have by their great Regard to Pudding given a Sanction to it that nothing can efface Is it not therefore Ancient Honourable and Commendable  Quare itaque fremuerunt Auctores  Why do therefore the Enemies of good Eating the Starvegutted Authors of  Grubstreet  employ their impotent Pens against Pudding and Puddingheaded  aliàs  Honest Men Why do they inveigh against DumplingEating which is the Life and Soul of Goodfellowship and DumplingEaters who are the Ornaments of Civil Society  But alas their Malice is their own Punishment The Hireling Author of a late scandalous Libel intituled  The DumplingEaters Downfall  may if he has any Eyes now see his Error in attacking so Numerous so August a Body of People His Books remain Unsold Unread Unregarded while this Treatise of  Mine shall be Bought by all who love Pudding or Dumpling to my Bookseller's great Joy and my no small Consolation How shall I Triumph and how will that Mercenary Scribbler be Mortify'd when I have sold more Editions of my Books than he has Copies of his I therefore exhort all People Gentle and Simple Men Women and Children to Buy to Read to Extol these Labours of Mine for the Honour of DumplingEating Let them not fear to defend every Article for I will bear them Harmless I have Arguments good store and can easily Confute either Logically Theologically or Metaphysically all those who dare Oppose me  Let not  Englishmen  therefore be asham'd of the Name of  PuddingEaters  but on the contrary let it be their Glory For let Foreigners cry out ne'er so much against Good Eating they come easily into it when they have been a little while in our  Land of Canaan  and there are very few Foreigners among us who have not learn'd to make as great a Hole in a good Pudding or Sirloin of Beef as the best  Englishman  of us all  Why shou'd we then be Laught out of Pudding and Dumpling or why  Ridicul'd out of Good Living Plots and Politics may hurt us but Pudding cannot Let us therefore adhere to Pudding and keep our selves out of Harm's Way according to the Golden Rule laid down by a celebrated DumplingEater now defunct  Be of your Patron's Mind whate'er he says  Sleep very much Think little and Talk less  Mind neither Good nor Bad nor Right nor Wrong  But Eat your Pudding Fool and Hold your Tongue  PRIOR  The Author of these excellent Lines not only shews his Wisdom but his GoodBreeding and great Esteem for the Memory of Sir  John  by giving his  Poem  the Title of  Merry Andrew  and making  Merry Andrew  the principal Spokesman For if I guess aright and surely I guess not wrong his main Design was to ascertain the Name of  Merry Andrew  to the  Fool  of a Droll and to substitute it instead of  Jack Pudding  which Name my Friend  Matt  cou'd not hear with Temper as carrying with  it an oblique Reflection on Sir  John Pudding  the Hero of this DUMPLEID  Let all those therefore who have any Regard to Politeness and Propriety of Speech take heed how they Err against this Rule laid down by him who was the Standard of  English  Elegance And be it known to all whom it may concern That if any Person whatever shall dare hereafter to apply the Name of  Jack Pudding  to  Merry Andrews  and suchlike Creatures I hereby Require and Impower any Stander or Standers by to Knock him her or them down And if any Action or Actions of Assault and Battery shall be brought against any Person or Persons so acting in pursuance of this most reasonable Request by Knocking down Bruising Beating or otherwise Demolishing such Offenders I will Indemnify and bear them
