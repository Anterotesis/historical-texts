 A POEM Sacred to the MEMORY of SIR ISAAC NEWTON  By JAMES THOMSON  His Tibi me Rebus quaedam divina Voluptas  Percipit atque Horror quòd sic Natura tuâ Vi  Tam manifesta patet ex omni Parte retecta  LUC  DUBLIN Printed by S POWELL for RICHARD NORRIS at the Corner of  Cranelane  in  Essexstreet  M DCC XXVII  Where may be had  Summer  a Poem and  Winter  a Poem  To the Right Honourable Sir  Robert Walpole  KNIGHT of the Most Noble  Order  of the  Garter  SIR  _SINCE I have ventur'd to write a Poem on a Gentleman who is universally acknowledg'd to be the Honour of our Country as a  Philosopher  prompted by the same Ambition I address it to her most illustrious  Patriot  Tho' by the wise Choice of the best of  Kings  you are engag'd in the highest and most active Scenes of Life balancing the Power of  Europe  watching over our common Welfare informing the whole Body of Society and Commerce and even like Heaven dispensing Happiness to the Discontented  and Ungrateful tho' thus gloriously employ'd yet are you not less attentive in the Hour of Leisure to the Variety Beauty and Magnificence of Nature nor less delighted and astonish'd at the Discoveries of the incomparable  Newton  The same comprehensive Genius which Way soever it looks must have a steady clear and unbounded Prospect  But not to encroach any further on your important Moments all devoted to the Good of Mankind I once more plead the Dignity of my Subject for my Excuse in this Approach and beg Leave to subscribe my self with the sincerest Veneration  SIR  Your most faithful humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  A POEM Sacred to the Memory of Sir ISAAC NEWTON  _SHALL the great Soul of NEWTON quit this Earth  To mingle with his Stars and every Muse  Astonish'd into Silence shun the Weight  Of Honours due to his illustrious Name  But what can ManEven now the Sons of Light  In Strains such as delight the Ear of GOD  Hail his Arrival on the Coasts of Bliss  Yet am not I deterr'd tho' high the Theme  And sung to Harps of Angels for with you  Aetherial Flames  ambitious I aspire  In Nature's general Symphony to join  AND what new Wonders can ye show your Guest  Who while on this dim Spot where Mortals toil  Clouded in Dust from  Motion  's simple Laws  Could trace the boundless Hand of Providence  Wideworking thro' this universal Frame  HAVE ye not listen'd while he bound the  Suns  And  Planets  to their Spheres Th' unequal Task  Of Humankind till then Oft had they roll'd  O'er erring Man the Year and oft disgrac'd  The Pride of Schools before their Course was known  Full in its Causes and Effects to Him  Allpiercing Sage Who sat not down and dreamt  Romantic Schemes defended by the Din  Of specious Words and Tyranny of Names  But bidding his amazing Mind attend  And with heroick Patience Years on Years  Deepsearching saw at last the System dawn  And shine of all his Race on him alone  WHAT were his Raptures then how pure how strong  And what the Triumphs of old  Greece  and  Rome  By his diminish'd but the Pride of Boys  In some small Fray victorious When instead  Of shatter'd Parcels of this Earth usurp'd  By Violence unmanly and sore Deeds  Of Cruelty and Blood  Nature herself  Stood all subdu'd by him and open laid  Her every latent Glory to his View  AND first our  solar System  he survey'd  With accurate Ken and by the mingling Power  Of  Gravitation  and  Projection  saw  The whole in silent Harmony revolve  Drawn to his lengthen'd Eye th' attending  Moons  Design'd to chear remoter Planets were  By him in all their mix'd Proportions seen  He also fix'd the wandering  Queen of Night  Whether she wanes into a scanty Orb▪  Or waxing broad with her pale shadowy Light  In a soft Deluge overflows the Sky  Her every Motion clear discerning He  Adjusted to th' obsequious  Main  and taught  Why now the mighty Mass of Waters swells  Resistless heaving on the broken Rocks  And the full River turning till again  The Tide revertive unattracted leaves  A Yellow Waste of idle Sands behind  THEN breaking hence he took his ardent Flight  Thro' the blue Infinite and every  Star  Which the clear Concave of a Winter's Night  Pours on the Eye or Astronomic Tube  Farstretching snatches from the dark Abyss  Or such as farther in successive Skies  To Fancy only shine at his Approach  Blaz'd into  Suns  Th' enlivening Centre each  Of an harmonious System All combin'd  And rul'd unerring by that single Power  Which draws the Stone projected to the Ground  O UNPROFUSE Magnificence divine  O  Wisdom  truly perfect thus to call  From a few Causes such a Scheme of Things  Effects so various beautiful and great  An Universe compleat And O Belov'd  Of Heaven into th' Almighty's Councils thus  To be admitted and allow'd to scan  The rising moving wideestablish'd Frame  HE too unbaffled in his Aim pursu'd  The  Comet  to' the long Elliptic Curve  As round innumerous Worlds he wound his Way  Till to the Forehead of the EveningSky  Reduc'd the blazing Wonder glares anew  THE Heavens are all his own Finish'd by him  The fair Discovery lies and every Eye  May lay the useless Telescope aside  Unless it be to hold the great Acquests  By  Newton  made Who from the wild Domain  Of the  Des Cartes  French Dreamer  rescu'd Heaven and Earth  All  Europe  stood appall'd but found it vain  To keep at Odds with Demonstration strong  And lingering to resist the awakening Force  Of Truth At once their pleasing Visions fled  With the gay Shadows of the Morning mix'd  When  Newton  rose our Philosophic Sun  TH' Aerial Flow of  Sound  was known to Him  From whence it first in wavy Circles breaks  Till the touch'd Organ takes the Message in  Nor could the darting  Beam  of Speed immense  Escape his swift Pursuit and measuring Glance  Even  Light it self  which every thing displays  Shone undiscover'd till his brighter Mind  Untwisted all the shining Robe of Day  And from the whitening undistinguish'd Blaze  Collecting every Ray into his Kind  To the charm'd Eye educ'd the gorgeous Train  Of  ParentColours  First the flaming  Red  Sprung vivid forth the tawny  Orange  next  And then delicious  Yellow  by whose Side  Fell the kind Beams of allrefreshing  Green  Then the pure  Blue  that swells autumnal Skies  Aetherial play'd and then of sadder Hue  Emerg  d the deepen'd  Indico  as when  The heavyskirted Evening droops with Frost  While the last Gleanings of refracted Light  Dy'd in the fainting  Violet  away  These when the Clouds distil the rosy Shower  Shine out distinct adown the watry Bow  While o'er our Heads the dewy Vision bends  Delightful melting on the Fields beneath  Myriads of mingling Dies from these result  And Myriads still remain th' exhaustless Source  Of Beauty everflushing evernew  DID ever Poet image ought so fair  Dreaming in whispering Groves by the hoarse Brook  Or Prophet to whose Rapture Heav'n descends  Even now the setting Sun and liveri'd Clouds  Seen  Greenwich  from thy lovely Heights declare  How just how beauteous the refractive Law  THE noiseless  Tide of Time  all bearing down  To vast  Eternity  's unbounded Sea  Where the green Islands of the Happy shine  He backward stem'd alone and to it's Source  Ascending mark'd it's Periods and hung out  His Lights at equal Distances to guide  Historian wilder'd on his darksome Way  BUT who can number up his Labours Who  His high Discoveries sing When but a few  Of the deepstudying Race can stretch their Minds  To image what he knew as clear as they  The Truths selfevident with which he link'd  His far thest Views For is there ought that's great  That's wonderful and hard deterring Search  That was his Prize and worthy of his Toil  Unfailing Who the lonely  Monarch  reign'd  Of  Science  thininhabited below  WHAT Wonder then that his  Devotion  swell'd  Responsive to his Knowledge For could he  Whose piercing mental Eye diffusive saw  The finish'd University of Things  In all its Order Magnitude and Parts  Forbear incessant to adore that Power  Who fills sustains and actuates the whole  SAY ye who best can tell ye happy few  Who saw him in the softest Lights of Life  All unwithheld indulging to his Friends  The vast unborrow'd Treasures of his Mind  O speak the wondrous Man how mild how calm  How greatly humble how divinely good  How firm establish'd on eternal Truth  Pure as his Faith and active as his Love  Fervent in doing well with every Nerve  Still pressing on forgetful of the Past  And panting for Perfection far above  Those little Cares and visionary Joys  That so befool the fond impassion'd Heart  Of overcheated evertrusting Man  AND say ye downward gloomyminded Tribe  Ye who unconscious of those nobler Flights  That reach impatient at immortal Life  Against the Prime indearing Privilege  Of  Being  dare contend say can a Soul  Of such extensive deep tremendous Powers▪  Enlarging still be but a finer Breath  Of Spirits dancing thro' their Tubes awhile▪  And then for ever lost in vacant Air  BUT hark Methinks I hear a warning Voice  Solemn as when some awful Change is come  Sound thro' the World  "He's deadThe Measure's full  "And I resign my Charge  Ye mouldering Stones  That build the towring Pyramid the proud  Triumphal Arch the Monument effac'd  By ruthless Ruin and whate'er supports  The worship'd Name of grey Antiquity  Down to the Dust What Grandeur can ye boast  While  Newton  lifts his Column to the Skies  Beyond the Waste of TimeLet no weak Drop  Be shed for him The Beauty in her Bloom  Cut off the Joyous Youth and darling Child  These are the Tombs that claim the tender Tear  And Elegiac Song but  Newton  calls  For other Notes of Gratulation high  That now he wanders thro' those endless Worlds  He here so well descry'd and wondering talks  And Hymns their Author with his glad Compeers  O BRITAIN'S Boast Whether with Angels thou  Sittest in dread Discourse or Fellow Saints  Who joy to see the Honour of their Kind  Or whether mounted on Cherubic Wing  Thy swift Career is with the whirling Spheres  Comparing Things with Things in Rapture lost  And lowly Adoration for that Light  So plenteous ray'd into thy Mind below  From Light himself O look with Pity down  On Humankind a frail erroncous Race  Asswage the Madness of a frantic World  But chiefly o'er thy Country's Cause preside  And be her  Genius  call'd Her Council steer  Correct her Manners and inspire her Youth  For guilty as she is she brought thee forth  And glorious in thy Name she points thee out  To all her Sons and bids them eye thy Star  While in Expectance of th' arrousing Blast  When Time shall be no more thy sacred Dust  Sleeps with her Kings and dignifies the Scene  THE END  BOOKS Printed for and Sold by  Richard Norris  at the
