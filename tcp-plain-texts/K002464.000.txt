 AN ESSAY ON Pope  's ODYSSEY  IN WHICH Some particular  Beauties  and  Blemishes  of that Work are consider'd  Each finding like a friend  Something to blame and something to commend  Pope  's  Miscel  Vol I  Le choix des  grans mots  donne aux choses une espece d'ame de vie les  beaux mots  sont la lumiere propre et naturelle de nos pensées mais un discours  tout simple  exprimera quelquefois mieux la chose que toute la pompe tout l'ornement  Boileau  Printed for  James  and  J Knapton R Knaplock W  and  J Innys J Wyatt D Midwinter  Booksellers in St  Paul  's ChurchYard  LONDON  And  S Wilmot  Bookseller in  OXFORD    THE  PREFACE  THERE is no Person more Odious than the Man who makes himself greatly Eminent It is a sort of tacit Reproach on the rest of the Species and every one feels his own meanness the more sensibly when he looks toward those exalted Genius's who have gain'd a Superiority over the rest of mankind This may make it obvious to imagine that the following Dialogues are partly design'd as Invectives and produc'd chiefly from that Blindside in Selflove which makes Men willing to d  rogate from every one who has  merit  enough to provoke and  fame  enough to make others think themselves lessen'd by the overgrowth of his Character  Tho' this reasoning be exceedingly true in general it ought to be consider'd  at the same time that any dislike to the Eminence of others naturally arises only among such persons as are got into the same paths of Fame The Gentlemen of the Sword cannot bear to have others rise over their head the Men of Genius look maliciously on a prevailing Poet But  Pope  I presume never envied  Marlborough  the Battle of  Blenheim  any more than that Hero envied him his Translation of  he  Iliad  'Tis for this Reason I might almost sa  that I  cannot  envy Mr  Pope  So  ar at least I am unbiass'd I can hear  he Applauses which are given that Gr  at Man I can admire the Passages which contribute to the deserving them but I cannot be uneasy at those or detract from these out of any prejudices arising from this Passion Give me leave to say farther that in reading that Work of his which occasion'd this Essay no one cou'd be more delighted than I was in several parts of it Many Beauties I saw in it and I imagin'd I saw some  Faults In some particular Conversations on this Head I have found my self indifferent in the Case and now I have here flung the Thoughts on both together I hope with some degree of Impartiality But if some things shou'd be blamed without sufficient Reason or others commended too highly and in a manner disproportion'd to what they deserve I submit each to the many better judges who may happen to meet with these sheets I ask pardon for any Errors in them I beg to be set right  Prefaces I think are the only places in which a Man may be allow'd to talk freely of that worst of subjects  Himself  I hope no body will deny one the use of so  aukward a Privilege  and shall therefore go on without any farther Apologies  To many it may perhaps seem arrogant to find fault at all with so distinguish'd and so noble a Poet as Mr  Pope  Indeed here are some things proposed as faulty from his Translation but they are only proposed the  World is to judge of them Where I have been mistaken in any of these Points it is not for want of a due deference to the merits of this Writer but from the shortness of my own sight On the contrary if any such Criticisms happen sometimes to be right the Eminence of the Poet will be so far from being a reason against them that it makes any true Cautions the more proper and in some sense perfectly necessary  Besides The learned World as I take it have ever allow'd a Liberty of thinking and of speaking one's sentiments That  serene Republick  knows none of the distance and distinctions which custom has introduced into all others There is a decent familiarity to be admitted between the Greatest and the Meanest Person in it This has often raised a Thought in me which has something wild and agreeable in it  when indulged to any degree 'Tis in Relation to the peculiar happiness of Men of Letters in that they can sit down in their closets  and converse with the greatest Writers of every Age or of any Nation and that in as much freedom and intimacy as their nearest Friends cou'd ever use toward any of them when living What an illustrious Assembly is there on those Shelves The Courts of  Augustus Lewis  the Fourteenth or  Charles  the Second never beheld such a frequency of great Genius's as stand round a Man in his own private Study How large an Happiness is it for a Person to have it in his Power to say at any time That he is going to spend the Afternoon with the most agreeable and most improving Company he will chuse out of all Ages If he is in a gay Humour perhaps with  Horace  and  Anacreon  and L  d  Dorset  or if more solid either with  Plato  Mr  Locke  or Sir  Isaac Newton  'Tis this ease of access 'tis the liberty arising from it which constitutes and preserves the felicity of the  Republick  of Letters The meaner sort which compose it are all Freevoters  and may speak their real Opinion without reserve at the same time the Characters too even of the greatest and first Men in it must be form'd and establish'd on this openness of Judging and that freedom of Observation  But waving whatever has been said of this Liberty in the Learned World most people will be apt to help one to an Excuse of another kind for most I think are very ready to agree that Mr  Pope  is only the Masterhand in this Translation and that he has been obliged with the assistance of some other Gentlemen in several parts of it Tho' I believe I am acquainted with this affair more than many who speak of it with a great deal of Confidence and Assurance any mention of it in the Piece is purposely avoided Mr  Pope  has recommended the whole with his Name He gives the finishing stroke to every thing and the Dialogues speak of him as if he were really the Author of the whole It  wou'd have been a confused thing and often not practicable to have spoken at every turn to the right Person This has occasion'd several applauses of the Poet which may seem too high for a stranger But as I have since had the greatest reason to be perswaded that Mr  Pope  is not the sole Translator I have at the same time equal reason to think that the other Gentlemen engaged are persons of establish'd Characters in the Poe  ick WorldAfter this perhaps those Compliments may still be allow'd to stand as they are I hope they are never wrought too high for Mr  Pope  himself and I believe they may generally be spoken very justly of his  Seconds  in the Work  One word more and I have done As to the manner of these Dialogues 'Tis the old  Platonick  way which  Cicero  brought from  Greece  and used so happily in the  Latin  Tongue It has had its Successes too among the Moderns  Fontenelle  will always be read with the greatest Pleasure where  he has follow'd it That Writer is peculiarly happy in all his Dialogues of whatever sort and in general may be said  to talk as well with Pen and Ink  as any Man in the World Mr  Dryden  and Mr  Addison  have recommended it among us by their Example Indeed the method it self is more capable of variety and which makes it particularly proper for the present Case it hath something of Action and Reality in it Besides that the common way among us of merely keeping up a Discourse between two blind Names is perhaps not very Commendable the Persons of the Dialogue in such Cases are generally like those Actors who have no Character in the Play and who only come in  to talk  upon the Stage They have no more distinction no other marks by which you may know one from another than the two  Capital Letters  which usually stand for them It is much otherwise and and much better among the Persons introduced by the Writers in the other  method their Great Names I use only to authorize this  manner  of Dialogue as that is all which I can pretend to imitate in them  As I ought to beg pardon of the Reader for troubling him with so long a Preface I shall at the same time take the opportunity of begging Pardon of  Antiphaus  and  Philypsus  the two Gentlemen who are disguised under the Persons of these Dialogues for giving to the World what was chiefly their Thoughts in a manner so much inferiour to what either of them might have done themselves I wish I might have leave to mention their real Names in this place That would add a weight to every thing they say Tho' indeed the Sentiments of those Gentlemen were they fully represented would not want the lustre of any Authorities to set them off except that of the the Reasonableness with which they both  think  and  speak  and for both which they have made themselves so remarkable in the World  An ESSAY c  EVENING the FIRST  _ANTIPHAUS  manag'd his Affairs so as to get this Winter sooner than usual to the Countryseat of his Friend  Philypsus  It is there that he passes his time when ever he can clear himself from the hurry of Business in a retirement every way agreeable and in a full enjoyment of those Pleasures which attend on a particular Friendship in an open and improving Conversation The Conversation there does not run in the present polite way of  saying and saying nothing  when alone they usually fall into some Points of Learning and as bo  h of them are particularly fond of Poetry  their Disputes turn more frequently on that Subject than any other Indeed their differing in Sentiment can scarce be call'd  Disputes  for whenever their Thoughts do not meet each of them shews a diffidence in his own Opinion and a willingness to submit to the Judgment of his Friend  It is by this means that they fall into each others Sentiments more than cou'd well be expected from Men of so different a Turn The enlarged Genius of  Philypsus  always led him to dwell upon the most beautified Parts of a Poem with the greatest Pleasure while  Antiphaüs  who has a very clear Head and has given much into a strict way of thinking is taken most with just Descriptions and plain natural Ideas The one was so possest with the Pleasure which he felt from fine Thoughts and warm Expressions that He did not take a full Satisfaction in low Beauty and simple Representations of Nature the other on the contrary had such an aversion to  glitterings  and  elevation  that he was distasted at any the least appearance of either If the latter was prejudiced for the Ancients from the Purity and Justness which we find in most of their Works  Philypsus  had his  foible  too and  was sometimes caught by the Flourish and Colouring of the Moderns In a word if  Philypsus  wou'd sometimes contemn a Point as low and mean tho' in reality proper enough and naturally express'd  Antiphaus  in his turn might happen now and then to blame a Passage which requir'd a good degree of Ornament as being too glaring and artificial  Among several other Topicks one Evening they happen'd to fall into a discourse on Mr  Pope  's new Translation of the  Odyssey  As they both found Beauties in that Piece agreeable to their particular Tastes they had read it over with a great deal of Pleasure however  Philypsus  was the Person who admired it the most "There are some Lines says he to  Antiphaus  pointing to the  Odyssey  which lay before them there are some Favourites of mine in that Poem which you must not look upon with your usual severity Prithee  Antiphaus  be more sensible to the Flame and Spirit of a Writer who is evidently Our present  Laureate in Genius  and the most enliven'd Translator of the Age "I will very readily allow what you say of that Great Man return'd  Antiphaus  and shall always pay a deference to your more lively taste of the Fine and Sublime in Poetry  but you must give me leave to dissent from you in some Particulars if I do not agree with your Sentiments in relation to several Lines and Passages of that Translation 'tis perhaps because I fall so much short of you in your  inward sense  of the high and elevated Beauties of Language As I cannot imagine that to be the reason says  Philypsus  I beg to hear those Particulars you talk'd of I am perswaded several of the Passages which I have observ'd you to be less taken with in reading the Translation will upon a closer view appear to be really Beauties to tell you the truth I long to make a Convert of you and beg you wou'd be full and large in communicating whatever Remarks you have made on this Performance The Evenings are long we have sufficient time upon our Hands and I know not how we can pass it away more agreeably  Antiphaus  paus'd for some time and seem'd to be taken up in recollecting his Thoughts on this Point at last taking a Tablet out of his Pocket  Since you desire it says he I will shew you what Observations I made as I went over the Work they are the Thoughts which struck me  en passant  and many of them will perhaps appear little and trifling  You will allow me I believe in the first place That Lines very good in themselves may be bad when consider'd as a Translation The aim of a Translator is to give us the  Spirit  of the Original and where the Original is just the very  manner  is to be observ'd By the Manner I would not intend the express words or the meer turn of a Period but that the Imitation ought to be easy simple and unadorn'd wherever the first Writer uses either of those Styles with Judgment You are well acquainted with that plain humble manner of  Homer  which is more particularly kept up by him in the  Odyssey  And as much as I admire several parts in this Translation I cannot but think there are places in it which differ from the Manner of  Homer  without sufficient reason for a Change The Poet in several parts of that Work seems to me to have let fall some Lines that are forc'd some of too much flourish and ornament and a few even swelling and unnatural where the Original is with good reason plain and natural  nd unadorn'd  Where we admire the Simplicity of  Homer  with Justice we cannot avoid blaming the want of it in his Translator Mr  Pope  intimates in one of his  B  Notes  That  no Reproach has ever fall'n upon  Homer  in relation to his sinking too Low or being too Familiar That as to these Particulars he preserves an Universal Justness and that there is not any one place in his Poem which can be justly censur'd upon this account If so a Translator of  Homer  has no occasion for raising any thing beyond what it is in the Original If he follows his Master it is sufficient All additional Flourish and Glitterings where we should meet with the plain and the familiar are at best so many beautiful Excrescencies  There is one Case which seems more particularly to lead Mr  Pope  into a glaring Stile 'tis almost ever to be found in his Descriptions of  Day  of  Light  and of the  Morning  'Tis true these are subjects which in themselves may require some brightness in the language but there is a great difference between giving one Light and dazling ones Eyes Beside the conformity to the Original there is another certain and easy way of judging whether the Brightning in these or any other Points be proper or not that Light we may be sure falls in a wrong manner or an undue proportion which does not make the thing more visible  There are of these Descriptions  Philypsus  which seem both to refine too much upon the Original and to err according to this Rule Did you ever observe those lines on one of the most agreeable Images in the World The break of Day they are in the beginning of the third Book If you will give me leave I will read them to you  The  sacred  Sun  above the Waters rais'd  Thro' Heaven's  eternal brazen Portals blaz'd  And wide o'er Earth diffus'd his  ch  aring  Ray  To Gods and Men to  give the golden Day  Several of these Expressions seemed to me at first sight to take from the Nature and Simplicity of the Description and when I turn'd to the Greek I found those very Expressions to have no Foundation there 'Tis the same Case in the following Lines  Translat Book V Orig δ'  Soon as the Morn in  o  ient Purple drest  Unbarr'd the Portal  of the roseate East c  B    When the MorningStar with early Ray  Flam'd in the front of Heaven c  You will find these short Sketches in  Homer  to be much more simple and natural  I leave it to your Judgment whether they appear better with these Colourings or not To add one Instance more of the same thing Is it more proper for  Circe  to tell  Ulysses  That he should stay that Night with her and  set sail the next Morning  or to hear her giving him leave to  B μ'    Spread his broad Sails and  plough the liquid way  Soon as the Morn  unveils her Saffron Ray  I must own says  Philypsus  this would have been more fit for the Description of a Voyage than for a Speech in a Place too where we only find Orders given for setting Sail at such a time  To me proceeded  Antiphaus  Mr  Pope  seems to Beautify too much in several other Points beside those Topicks we have been talking of as where he calls the Nobles of  Phoeacia  B ζ'  A radiant Band  of Noblemen and where he introduces  Helen  with  B δ'  a Gale of rich Perfume breathing before her  If  Homer  mentions  Cups of solid Gold  in Mr  Pope  B α'  The Gold gives  lustre  to the  purple  Draught  B γ'  And in the  dazling  Goblet  laughs  the Wine  You cannot but observe by the way that the Original here is designed to signify the  real  intrinsick Value while only the  outside  and more glittering Circumstances are what the  English  dwells upon entirely but to go onThe Horns of a Bullock are in this new Language  B γ'  Budding Honours  and those of a Ram if I am not much mistaken  B δ  translucent Crescents Pallas  is well known to have had  Blue Eyes  given her by the Ancients now it is  B δ'  Celestial Azure brightning in her Eyes  This heightning of things by a severe Critick might be thought blameable and indeed whenever it interferes where the Passions ought to be touch'd it certainly is so in an higher degree The Reader is delighted when after a melancholly Scene he sees  Penelope  reviv'd by a Message from the Gods and  B α'  secretly enjoying the Satisfaction of her Soul but what Passion what Idea has he when instead of this he is told of her  B α'  Hearts dilating and glowing with florid Joy  Paint to him that unhappy  Princess in her Distress retiring  silently  and crying herself toS leep only shew the Circumstances and the Reader must be moved Does her Behaviour and her Sufferings strike him so forcibly when he finds it embellish'd into  B α'  Echoing Grief  and  Silverstreaming Eyes  But however these Passages may seem to be weaken'd by the finery and luxuriance of the Language this certainly is not so much the fault of  Pope  as of the Age We give much into an airy way If a Verse runs off smooth 'tis no matter for depth or clearness and as the Ancients valued Thoughts more than Sound we seem to be taken with Sounds more than Thought To speak out we are got into an idle manner of Versifying and if Mr  Pope  sometimes falls into it we are not so much to blame him for those Particulars as to wonder that he does not do it more frequently in so general a debauch of Taste among us  Hold interrupted  Philypsus  if You go on at this rate You will seem only to be got into the old Cant of running down our own Times I do not believe but that I cou'd name some Poet among us  to answer any of those who flourish'd in the  Augustan  Age As to the present Point we rarely hear of any such thing as  Translation  among them In  Satyr  we have the great Names of  Rochester Dryden  and  Oldham  not to mention the new kind of Satyr introduc'd among us by  Butler  In  Critical Poems  there are You know two or three very good beside that incomparable Piece by Mr  Pope  all to weigh against poor  Horace  As for  miscellaneous  Subjects think of  Cowley Pope Waller  and  Pryor  to mention no more of them In the  Epick Milton  may dispute the Laurel with either  Virgil  or  Homer  and in  Dramatick  Pieces of either kind we have Writers that indisputably exceed any of the Ancients  Antiphaus  was not inclin'd to enter into a dispute of this nature "I was only speaking says he of our present Taste in Poe  ry and the prevailing manner of those writers who are now upon the Stage As to this  Philypsus  give me leave to say that the language of our Writers and the practice of the World is much infected with the  Finesse  I think 'tis Mr  Locke  observes  that the humours of a People may be learnt from their usage of words  This symptom of the disease is very strong in the pre  ent Case thus to say that a verse  is  bien tourné  is the highest commendation among the French Criticks in general the  Beau Monde  is the only name now for what was call'd by a very different one formerly as a  fine  Scholar  polite  Literature and the  Belles Lettres  are the leading expressions when we would speak of Learning in the best sense And I appeal to you who are so well acquainted with all our Poets whether their practise in particular does not fall more and more into the  Finesses  we have been complaining of We may partly judge of this from some Lines in the Best of them the Writer whose Works lye before us I was just going to give you a few more instances of it from the  Odyssey  Is there any Figure so much abus'd by the Moderns as what they call the  Antithesis  they run it into a down right playing upon Words  Cowley  's Poetry cou'd not  live  without it  Dryden  uses it almost perpetually in his Translation o  Virgil  and was ridicul'd You know o  that head by the late Duke of  Buckingham  I have observ'd with pleasure that Mr  Pope  in his Translation very much avoids this little beauty which the other affected so excessively yet I have a place before me where one of this kind ha  slipt from his Pen It runs thus He  is speaking of a Stranger's Arrival at the Court of  Penelope  disorder'd so much by the riot of the Suitors  When to taste her hospitable board  Some Guest arrives with rumours of her Lord  B ξ'  And these  indulge their want  and  those their woe  And  here the t  ars and there the goblets flow  Pardon me says  Philypsus  there you do not seem to do the Translator Justice the Figure is countenanc'd by  Homer  himself You see here is an  Antithesis  in the Original "That answer'd  Antiphaus  seems rather to be a Contrast to set the riot of the Suitors in a stronger light But call it what you please it is only single there whereas you see it multiplied and worn to Rags in the Translation This overdoing a Point is observable in many other Cases as much as in the former and in some is carried on to a degree which borders upon the  Forc'd  and  Unnatural  Telemachus  bursting into Tears at the Name of his Father end  avours to hide his Sorrow from  Menelaus  who was then talking with him  Homer  says only that  B δ'    Menelaus observ'd him  which words Mr  Pope  draws out into this Couplet  The Conscious Monarch pierc'd the coy disguise  And view'd his filial love with vast surprize  For an humble natural Description o  a Tripod or Caldron set upon the Fire I wou'd recommend you to the following lines  The Flames  climb  round it with a  fierce embrac  B θ'    The fuming Waters  bubble o'er the Blaze  But above all in my Opinion are these on a Person tired and quite spent  Lost in lassitude lay all the Man  B ε'  Depriv'd of Voice of Motion and of Breath  The Soul scarce waking in the Arms of Death  Or these  B ζ'  Ye Gods since this  worn frame refection knew  What scenes have I survey'd of dreadful view  Wou'd you Imagine that all which countenances this in the Original is a Passage in  Ulysses  's Speech after his Shipwreck  in which he intimates  That he had not bath'd for a considerable time  I find it so says  Philypsus  and own the Lines to be somewhat forc'd and unnatural indeed those you have repeated seem generally to draw too near to that Character But I cannot conceive by what means they sound so harsh to me at present when I read the Piece there was scarce a Line of them which gave me any offenceYes it must be by your tearing them from the Body of the work that they now seem not so agreeable Really  Antiphaus  this is not sair usage of an Author You rob them of their Order and Connection and 'tis thenc  that they perfectly lose the Beauty which they had in the Whole Very true r  ply'd  Antiphaus  the warmth of Reading the thread of the Story and a general tunableness in the Verse will carry  a Man on strangely and may sometimes cheat him into a  alse Pleasure But then it is for this very reason that I shou'd think the justest method of forming a judgment on Particulars is to consider them apart However let us try it for once in a more entire Passage than any of the former Let me see The place I have dipt upon is where  Minerva  tells  Ulysses  that she will transform  him into the figure of an Old Man that he may view the posture of his Affairs unsuspected and unknown The Lines in  Homer  may be thus read into English  to  I will make you says that Goddess to the Hero entirely unknown to all Men the beauty and smoothness of your Skin shall be taken away your Limbs bent and the Hair of your Head turn'd grey I will then fling a Garb over you that shall make you frightful and odious to those that see you All that flame and life in your Eyes shall be lost I will so far deform them that you shall look contemptible to all the Suitors to your own  Penelope  and to your Son whom You left yet an Infant in your Palace  You know that Mr  Pope  in comparing some Passages in the Prophesies of  Isaiah  with the famous Eclogue of  Virgil  turns the latter into Prose If we follow that Example in the present case his Translation of these Lines runs thus  Od  V to  It fits thee at present to wear a dar  disguise and walk secret unknown to the Eyes of Mortals For this my Hand sha  wither every Beauty and  every eleganc  of Form and Face  Spread  a bark of Wrinkles  over thy smooth Skin turn  the auburn honours of thy Head  hoar disfigure with coarse attire every Limb and extinguish all the Fire in thy Eyes add all the decays of Life and all the wants of it  strange thee from thy Own thy Son and thy Wife  every sight  shall turn from the loath'd object and the blind suitors  scorn their destruction  Give me leave to go out of my way a little to try the same Experiment on a single Passage from the  Iliad  which is flourish'd and set off in an extraordinary manner It is in the Nineteenth Book where we have a poetical account of a fine Breed of Horses The Original runs thus    Three Thousand Mares graz'd these Meads with their young Foals running by them  Boreas  was enam  ur'd of them as they  ed there and turning himself into the shape of a fine black Horse accomplish'd his desires Of this breed were twelve of the Colts  Mr  Pope  's Translation only allowing equivalent Expressions to blind the Rhimes runs thus  Iliad  B V  His spacious Pastures bred three Thousand Mare  and  three Thousand  Foals  ed  beside  their Mothers  Boreas enamour'd of the  sprightly train  conceal'd his  Godhead in the Locks of Hair  that flow'd over his Shoulders he  neigh'd  to his  Loves with dissembled Voice  and  cours'd the dapple Beauties  o'er the Meadow Twelve others of  unrival'd sort  sprung hence  swift as their Mother  Mares  and Father  Wind  This if overwrought is the more blameable because the matter is carried very far even in the Original and so is the less capable of being stretch'd any farther Mr  Pope  in his note upon the Place observes  That Homer has the happiness of making the least Circumstance considerable and that the plainest matter  shines  in his dress of Poetry  It is true it shines sufficiently in that Some brightning is necessary in Poetry but an excess of it  Philypsus  may dazle or may blind our Eyes it can never assist or delight them  By comparing these Passages You will see that which I intend the difference of Manner in the Ancient and Modern Poetry In the latter we find Expressions added which seem to be added for beauties and which in reality perhaps only turn the Plainness and Strength of the Original into the  Fine  and the  Artificial  Upon  Philypsus  's acknowledging that he thought the Point too much labour'd and the Translation unequal Yes says  Antiphaus  the Translator himself seems to be sensible of it in the present Case for soon after when the former Passage is repeated in the    Original he gives an entirely new  B  Turn to it And I believe upon hearing the Lines you will be of opinion that excepting a word or two it is render'd with a better grace and with more Justice than we find inthe former  She spake then touch'd him with her powerful Wand  The Skin shrunk up and wither'd at her Hand  A swift OldAge o'er all his Members spread  A sudden Frost was sprinkled on his Head  Nor longer in the heavy Eyeball shin'd  The glance Divine forth beaming from the Mind  His Robe with Spots indelible besmear  In Rags dishonest flutters with the Air  Mr  Pope  without question is happy in a great share of Judgment as well as Vivacity and Spirit in Writing but it is next to impossible in so long a Translation especially as it is in  Rhime  not to give sometimes into Sound and Ornament when to crown all the Vogue of the World goes so strong for both Do not ask whether I should desire to see  both of them banisht out of Poetry far from it Expressive Sounds are of use in the most natural and Variety in the management of them is necessary to keep up Attention in the Reader That and Ornament is what sets Poetry above Prose All I wou'd say is this that Sound is not sufficient where we might expect Sense and that in  humble  Passages in  natural  Descriptions or in moving most of the  Passions  additional ornaments are so many blemishes Dressing up the expressiveness of  Homer  in such fineries is much the same as if one shou'd throw a very gay modern dress over the  Hercules  of  Farnese  or any of the most Nervous Statues of the Ancients  But You will allow Ornament where the subject will bear it and where the Original leads the WayIn a translation answer'd  Antiphaus  it is proper perhaps only in the latter Case but allowing it in both it shou'd never be overwrought in either Too much Finery is always Affectation and I wish our Writers at present were not so generally given  to elevate and surprize and all that  as Mr  Bayes  calls it  The running into this excess so much is what has unsinew'd our Poetry 'Tis with Poetry as it is in Buildings the  being vastly Studious of Ornament does not only take away from the Strength of the Work but is a sure token of a vitiated taste in the Designer  You are always blaming the Modern Refinements says  Philypsus  but will you not allow that this taste of the Age is a sufficient justification at least of Mr  Pope  in those cases where he complies with itWe must  write  so as to please the World and  speak  so as to be most easily understood Custom will often wear away the propriety of things of this Nature and as for the propriety of language that depends upon it entirely I allow to u  e your own thought that a profusion of Lace and Embroidery wou'd be a disguise upon an Old Hero but they are so far from being improper that they are becoming on the Heroes of our Age  They may become the Heroes of our Age replied  Antiphaus  smiling perhaps on a far different account there is another Character now wove into and blended with that of a Soldier to which these things are very agreeable How many are there of these Heroes as you call them whose Courage reaches no farther than their Swordknot and whose Conduct is taken up wholly in their Dress But consider a Man barely as a Soldier  think of him in the midst of some warm Action and these little Ideas of him will disappear Then it is  that  posture  that  pressing on the foe  that  grasping of his Sword  that  fierceness in his Eyes  that  serenity and  that  eagerness on his countenance which strike us wholly and take up all our attention Yes  Philypsus  if you view a real modern Hero in a true light those fineries do not set well upon him and I think I never saw any thing more truly ridiculous than the Piece we were laughing at the other Day in your PictureGalleryGood Heaven The Duke of  Marlbrough  in the heat of an Engagement with a fullbottom'd Wigg very carefully spread over his Shoulders  But to return to the present taste in PoetryIf this Corruption of the Age cou'd excuse a Writer for what he composes now must it be carried down as far as  Homer's  Days must his Heroes love and talk and fight  alamode  must his strong sententious lines be set to the new polite airs of  Handel  and  Bononcini  Yet were what you wou'd alledge of any force it wou'd carry the matter thus far and the whole  Iliad  and  Od  ss  y  ought to be enervated down to the present taste No whatever may be allow'd to any of the proper genuine productions of this  Age it ought not to make an inrode upon all others let  Homer  's  energy  and  pathos  be violated as little as is possible Nature ought to rule in his Works and those of the Antients as ornament and surprize and elevation have in their turn the Empire of the Modern World  You see I beg into shew the old heat that this subject I think always betrays me intoI beg pardon  Philypsus  and will attend more to what I am about for the futureI shou'd have given you some instances of this  Elevation  from the translation before us  Apropos  What a glaring description of a Sword have we in the Eighth  Odyssey  Whose blade of Brass  displays  A r  ddy gleam  whose hilt  a Silver blaze  B θ'  Whose ivory sheath  inwrought  with  curious pride  Adds  graceful terror to the wearer's side  Homer  says that  Hermione  was  as beautiful as Venus  this is low and humble in comparison of Mr  Pope  's  Hermione  B δ'  On whom  a radiant Pomp of Graces  wair  Resembling  Venus  in  attractive state  Where a prodigy is sent to the  Ithacensians  in Council  Homer  says that  they  were struck at the sight of it and revolv'd in their Minds what it might presage to them  this Mr  Pope  renders after the following manner  B  β'  The wondring rivals gaze with cares oppres  And chilling horrors freeze in every Breast  How mean is it and how much lik  prose to tell us that  Penelope heard t  mirth of the Suitors  to elevate this sufficiently You must say  B    The shrilling Airs the valuted Roof rebounds  R  flecting to the Queen the Silver Sounds  This false way of  animating  Poetry a  no doubt many will be pleas'd to call i  grows particularly prejudicial and absur  in any case where the  Passions  are to b  rais'd in the Reader or describ'd in th  Persons of the Poem Where we wou'  move Pity in particular nothing is  m  e odious than a shew of Eloquence  Nature has provided a Sympathy in o  Souls She has put a biass into our Temper that inclines us forcibly to Compassion  Odi reum cui esse diserto vace  Quin  Lib c  and we shou'd  Quicquid

The lines You have just repeated interrupted  Philypsus  are such as I cannot admire but I think you carry the point too far against Art in general Is there not the greatest Art required in moving the passions why then have  Cicero  and all the Criticks of old given us so numerous rules in this Case Yes reply'd  Antiphaus  great Art or rather a great Genius is very necessary toward any excellence this way But what I have said was intended not so much against the  Use  of Art as the  Appearances  of it 'Tis the greatest of Arts to conceal the Art you use and to have it very evident is the greatest of Blemishes The Criticks and  Cicero  in particular speak with the greatest plainness against any thing of that kind Where the passions are to be touch'd apparent art is apparent fraud so that here particular care should be taken that nothing be overwrought  'Tis on this account that when You compare the following lines to the Original  You will not I dare say be over  ond of them  The  Soul of Friendship  to my hope is lost  B δ'  Fated to wander from his natal coast  He said  chill horrors  shook my  shivering Soul  B δ'  Rack'd with Convulsive pangs in d  st  roll  And that entire passage of  Penelope  Rolling Convulsive on the Floor is seen  The piteous object of a prostrate Queen  Words to her dumb Complaint a pause supplies  And breath to waste in unavailing Cries  Around their Sovereign wept the  menial Fair  B δ'  To whom she thus  addr  ss'd her deep despai  c  I wish this false elevation and profusion of Ornament does not carry Mr  Pope  in some few Cases into down right  Fustian  See p  A Man's being lost in Lassitude  and  a Soul scarce waking in the Arms of Death  look'd very much that way Do You remember where he talks of  B  Princes on Princes roll'd  and  Obs on B Ver  Gods being heap'd on Gods  Or how in another place we are told that  B  Th  Pharian Isle  Fronts the deep Roar of d  s  mboguing N  le  You know the Character of some o  Sir  John Falstaff  's Attendants in the  Merr  Wives of Windsor  a sort of Men who are industrious in talking hard Words and whose  Humour  is to be  unintelligible  One wou'd almost Imagine the humble Account of shutting a Door in the end of the First  Odyssey  to be copied from those illustrious Originals  The Door  reclos'd  The Bolt  ob  dient  to the si  ken Cord  B α'    To the  strong Staple's inmost depth restor'd  S  c  r  d the Valves  I own says  Philypsus  I cannot but give up those lines to you and several of the other You mention'd before The first lines when You repeated them I took tobe the very worst You could pick out of the  Od  ssey  But I know not how i  comes about You rise gradually in your demands upon me and are got insensibly from lines in that piece which were forc'd and too much beautified to things unnatural and shocking When I thought of making a Convert of You to an entire admiration of Mr  Pope  I fancy I was much mistaken at this rate you will turn the Tables upon me and to tell You the truth I cannot but confess that  the Poet has in some Cases fallen into each of the faults You mention  In some Cases doubtless reply'd  Antiphaus  that Gentleman is not to be commended I take his Translation to be as good as any Translation of  Homer  into  English  and in  Rhime  cou'd be expected to be In all probability we might safely add that no other Writers of the Age cou'd in the whole have perform'd such a task so well But a perfect Piece of this kind cannot be expected If  Homer  himself is allow'd to Sleep a little his Translator certainly may Nod sometimes  One thing I observ'd interrupted  Philypsus  in the lines you have repeated that the faultiness of several of them was owing to an Excess in one of the greatest Beauties of Poetry I mean the  Metaphors  too frequent in them I observ'  the same says  Antiphaus  as I was collec  ing these little Remarks it occasion'  my using a particular Paper for that sin…gle point If it did not grow so late  wou'd shew it to You butNo le  us have it now cry'd  Philypsus  I neve  knew any thing of yours too long and  it be that Paper in your Hand I shou  think it much too short were it not fo  my concern for the Poet and the desi  I have of finding as few Faults in his Writings as possible  Metaphor  says  Philypsus  is certainly the most universal enlivener of Poetry At the same time that it adds to the dignity of Verse it gives it an agreeable variety together with a power of Painting out all its Images in the boldest and strongest manner in the World 'Tis this which animates those objects which must otherwise be still and unaffecting it  lings every thing into Motion Life and Action By this the Arrow is  eager  and on the Wing by this the Sword  thirsts  for Blood and the Spear  rages  in the Hands of the Warriour  Metaphor  raises each subject out of the heavy narrative way it creates new Beings it represents the passions of Men and even meer  Names  as animated and imbodied and shews them in the posture and attitudes of Agents Thus when the Battles are going to join You see  Rage stalk  amidst the Combatants pointing with one  Hand  to the Enemy and in the other shaking the  Torch of War  By this the Valleys and Mountains  rejoice  when  Peace  once more  spreads  her downy Wings and  Plenty  descends from Heaven upon the  happy  climate 'Tis  Metaphor  which makes the Woods and Caves  answer  to the  voice of the Poet and the murmuring Stream  compassionate  his complaints 'Tis this which makes the  Nile know Caesar  and  the Sea  its present  Monarch  If Mr  Pope  manages this powerful Figure frequently to the best advantage sometimes he happens not to be so happy in the use of it The force of  Metap  or  is to make things strong clear and sensible any confusion destroys the very end of it and yet a little inaccuracy may occasion gross errors this way Sometimes what is just with the  Figurative  may disagree with the  Proper  sometimes again an idea which might stand with the  proper  expression will be inconsistent with the  figurative  A misapplication either way is very obvious and yet it gives a jar to the Ideas and makes the sense of a line to be perplexed and in confusion  It sounds but oddly to talk of a Person and of his Picture without any manner of distinction To say that  the piece drawn by Sir Godfrey Kneller for Mr Pope  is an excellent Poet and Writes with th  greatest Command imaginable  Or that  Mr Pope is a very good piece and his fac  very well colour'd tho' he is but just recover'  from a fit of Sickness  either of them w  u'd carry a mixt incoherent sense with  them This I take to be partly the Case in the following Lines  B δ'    Now from my  fond embrace  by Tempests torn  Our other  Column of the State  is born  Nor took a  kind adieu    B ι'    They  sweep  Neptunes smooth  Face  B β'    Declining with his  s  ping Wh  els  Down  sunk  the  Sun    To say  the Go  of Light was driving his Car down the Steep of Heaven  as Mr  Pope  somewhere expresses it is metaphorical To say  the Sun is setting  is proper but shou'd one say  The Sun is setting with s  oping Wheels  This would be neither Metaphorical nor Proper nor cou'd it raise any thing in the Mind but a confusion of Ideas  Again  B ι'  As some lone Mountain's monstrous grow  h he stood  Crown'd with rough thickets and a noddingwoo  Again  B ι'    Hear me Oh  Neptune  thou whose  Arms are h  rl'd  From Shore to Shore and  gird  the sol  d World  I think  Neptune  has the luck of it for 'tis the same Deity that in another  place makes just such a Figure as I have seen him in some  MortlockHangings  B  ε'  The raging Monarch shook his  zure Head  And thus in secret to his Soul he said  c  B ε  This said his  Seagreen Steeds  divide the Foam  Such confusions of the  Metaphor  and the  Proper  have a great resemblance to that absurdity of mixing  Fable  and  Reality  together which appears so grosly in Mr  Dryden's Hind and Panther  and which was the very thing that provoked Lord  Halifax  to ridicule that Piece with such infinite humour and good sense The Noble Author's Words on that subject may give a Sidelight to what I mean in the present Case Speaking of the Ancient Fabulists  They wrote says he  Preface to the  Hind and Panther Transvers'd  in Signs and spoke in Parables all their Fables carry a double meaning The Story is one and entire The Characters the same throughout not broken or chang'd and always conformable to the nature of the Creatures they introduce They never tell you that  the Dog  which  snapt  at a shadow lost his  Troop of Horse  that wou'd be unintelligibleThis is his  Dryden'    new way of telling a Story and confounding the  Moral  and the  Fable  together  After instancing from the  Hind and Panther  he goes on thus  What relation has the  Hind  to our  Saviour  or what notion have we of a  Panther's Bible  if you say he means the  Church  how does the  Church feed on Lawns or range in the Forest  Let it be always a Church or always the Clovenfooted Beast for we cannot bear his shifting the Scene every Line  I had almost forgot to tell You that upon consulting the Original there was no  Metaphor  at all to be found for either of the Lines I last repeated from the  Odyssey  We have now  Metaphors  perpetually the Translator is vastly fond of them I need not say that an Excess this way is very blameable You know the Criticks speak against it in a high strain and one of them goes so far as to say that this  F  equens  M  taphorae usus  obscurat    aedio complet  continuus vero in allegoriam aenigma exit  Quintil  Instit L c  Figure when frequent obscure  the Piece and fatigues the Reader when continual 'tis no longer a Poem 'tis all Allegory and Enigma  As a  alse Mixture of the proper and the figurative confuses the sense The  joining  Metaphors  together which do no  agree makes it still more dark and perplexed These are like what they call  MedleyPieces  a huddled kind of Pictures  which shew a Variety of Objects flun  together without any order or design  As that in the beginning of  Horace's A  of Poetry  they join the Limbs of on  Creature to the Body of another an  confuse all the properties and circumstances of an Action  If the Poet be not very careful he ma  by these means tye not only things improper but even contrarieties together  Do not the following Lines border o  this to me the  Metaphors  in them see  to be improperly united  From  Elateus  's strong Arm the  Discus  flies  And  Sings with unmatch'd Force  along the Skies  And  Laodame whirls High  with dreadful sway  B θ'    The Gloves of Death  At the same Time nothing can b  more  Proper  and  Narrative  than the Original in that place  Again  B λ'    From his Eyes  pour'd down  the  tender Dew  B δ'  But  Anticlus  unable to controul  Spoke  loud  the  languish  of his yearning Soul  In these the Action is describ'd in words that import a  violence  while the Act to be express'd is plainly something  still  and  gentle  Nothing is more known in relation to the  Metaphor  than that rule of  Cicero  's  Verecunda d  bet esse Transl  io ut deducta esse in alienum locum non irruisse atque ut precario non vi venisse videa  urEst hoc magnum ornamentum orationis in quo obscuritas fu  d  st  Cicero  de Oratore Lib  That it shou'd be so modest as to seem to have been  handed  into the place of the proper Word not to have forced its Way thither it shou'd fall into it in a free  voluntary  manner  Otherwise it will make the sense dark and intricate and that absolutely destroys all the use of it for as  Metaphor  shou'd be the  Verecunda d  bet esse Transl  io ut deducta esse in alienum locum non irruisse atque ut precario non vi venisse videa  urEst hoc magnum ornamentum orationis in quo obscuritas fu  d  st  Cicero  de Oratore Lib  greatest Light and Ornament of Language Obscurity is the most absurd thing and the most to be avoided in Metaphor  If so I wou'd ask whether it be very natural to talk of  B  the Womb of a Vessel  What congruity is there What Idea have You of the  Forehead  of  Night  of a  Star  or of the  Heavens  yet in the Translation  we meet with  Metaphors  of thi  kind and tho' it may be tolerable to talk of  the  B  Front of Heaven  the othe  two  B    The blazing Forehead of a Sta    and  B  the Matron Brow of Night  ar  scarce to be born with For my part I shou'd not have expected these Expressions from Mr  Pope  They rather pu  me in mind of another Gentleman wh  in a Poem of his speaking of the Churc  of  England  says that  Tate  's Mausolaeum  Divinely bright her  FrontletStars  appear'd  While up towards Heaven her ravish'd Eyes sh  rear'  I desire you would give me your Sentiments on another passage what do yo  think of the Images in the followin  Line  They cuff they tear their Che  ks and Necks  Do You remember whom 'tis spoke of Really says  Philypsus  I cannot we  determine whether it is spoken of  Me  or of a couple of  Beasts  fighting  neither answer'd  Antiphaus  'tis used  Eagles  in the  B  Odyssey  and in the  Iliad  of a couple of  Vultures  f Iliad    There is an Observation arising from this which ought to be consider'd in transferring  Metaphors  it may be said that the word  Cheeks  in this Verse is justified by the Original Custom  Philypsus  is the great Rule of Words and what is easy in one Language will not bear in another because usage may have soften'd in one what in the other is yet harsh and unwarrantable This is evident from the very Word in debate Thus we use  Cheeks  in English of some Creatures beside Men the Term is so far familiarized and sounds very well Yet to talk of the Cheeks of a  Pheasant  or the Cheeks of a  Vulture  will by no means sound the softer for it's prevailing in those other particulars  However this is agreed on all hands that a  Metaphor  is not to be used unless it gives a greater light and makes the thing more sensible to us Are the Borrow'd terms in this Case  more  expressive than the Native Nay do they give you  as clear  Ideas as the Native would Do they give you as clear where the Poet talks of  B  asswaging Thirst with a generous  intage  or of  Polypheme  's doing the same thing with a  B  Milky deluge  What do  you think of an  B    Ozierfringed Bank  of a  Voice  just heard  B  wounding the Ear  or of the Seas being call'd  the  B  howling desart of the Main  Mr  Pope  B Notes  questio  s whether the nodding of a Mountain be a natural Image  shou'd not You be apt to think too that  a Mountain  B  shaking the Forests on his sides  is fitter for an Earthquake than a  Metaphor  What sort of Idea have You of a  B  wellfought Wall  or a  B  thriceear'd Field  in a Word have You any Idea at all when he tells us of  Jove  's  B  rearing a Tempest  or of the  B  whistling Winds waking the Sky  Philypsus  consulted his own Mind all along as these points were offer'd and endeavour'd very fairly to discover whether the Images were as clear and evident as they ought to be He knew that the great use and  Modus nullus est  florentior  nec qui plus luminis afferat Orationi  Cicero  de Oratore Lib  beauty of Metaphor was to give Light and Perspicuity to a description  to cloath Words as he us'd to say with Substance and to make  Language visible  But as upon this View he cou'd not answer fully what had been  produc'd he was willing to evade it as much as he cou'd These Instances says he turning to  Antiphaus  tho' few for so large a Piece when laid together are apt to incline ones judgment to the prejudice of the Translator it will not be  air to look only on the worst side of him We owe it to Justice and to the Excellencies of that great Man to give one Evening to his Beauties as well as this to his DefectsBe so good then interrupted  Antiphaus  as to undertake that part for the next You know me so well I need not assure you that I shall be as much pleas'd with hearing the Beauties as I am uneasy in repeating the Faults of this Writer  After some other discourse  Antiphaus  going for his own apartment and reflecting upon what had pass'd between him and his friend took occasion to observe  How impossible almost it is for thegreatest Genius not to fail sometimes in an undertaking of this Nature and how unavoidable it will be  or the Reader in a Poem generally well wrote not to be led away from observing those faults by the vast Power of Ornament the easy Fluency of the Verse and his Engagements to the Beauties of a favourite Piece  The best qualified  added he  will thus err when ever they  write  for Fame and the most judicious will be thus deceiv'd when they  read  for Pleasure  An ESSAY c  EVENING the SECOND  _BETWEEN company and business it was some time before  Philypsus  and  Antiphaus  cou'd get an Evening to themselves the latter had waited for it with some impatience and did not fail pretty early in it to remind  Philypsus  of his promise I long says he to see your Remarks such a method of viewing a Poem is something like the way of our favourite  Vertot  in writing History we have the material Parts of it without passing thro' the dead Lines which go toward the Narrative or the less significant Passages which are to fill up the Chain of Events You must not expect  any great Matters answer'd  Philypsus  Tho' I have had longer time than we talk'd of at first it has been sufficient only for collecting some of the scatter'd Beauties of this excellent Translation  Some of the Lines which you repeated the former Evening shew'd that the Greatness of his Genius had led Mr  Pope  sometimes into an Excess if things can be too much beautified that fault does certainly belong to him In a few lines I confess he discovers a greater love of Ornament than is becoming This is the fountain of all the several Peccadillo's which you observ'd from his writings whatever there is to be found in them either too  glaring  or  forc'd  or  figurative  or too much  elevated  may fairly be accounted for this way You Sir produc'd some Passages as I remember under each of these Characters But how pardonable is it for so exalted a Genius to run sometimes into an excess of Ornament And how admirable for such to excell often in the just handsome natural  Manner  As Mr  Pope  in the former may possibly want some favourable Allowances He must certainly command the highest Esteem in the latter  Is not almost the entire  B to Verse  Episode  of  Menelaus  and  Proteus  particularly just and beautiful What can have a greater share of Nature without any excesses than the Adventure with  B  Nausicaa  How justly are the Passions preserv'd in  B  The Descent into Hell  and before in all the Speeches  Books and  of  Circe  and  Calypso  Tho' these Passages are generally of too great a length to bear repeating in a single Evening you will indulge me with the reading some of the most finish'd Parts of them  The whole  Episode  is particularly well wrote but the things chiefly to be admir'd in it are the  Metamorphosis  of  Proteus  His Speech on the unhappy Curiosity of Menthe account immediately after of the Deaths of  Ajax  and  Agamemnon  and above all that enliven'd Conclusion in Relation to  Elysium  and the future Happiness of  Menelaus  You remember the various Transformations of  Proteus  and I believe will allow them to be exceedingly well express'd  A Lion now he curls a surgy mane  Sudden our bands a spotted Pard restrain  Then arm'd with tusks and lightning in his eyes  A Boar's obscener shape the God belies  On spi  y volumes there a Dragon rides  Here from our strict embrace a Stream he glides  And last sublime his stately growth he rears  B to  A Tree and welldissembled foliage wears  The Lines are extremely good says  Antyphaus  but I had a Thought came into my Head that possess'd me all the time you were reading them I cou'd not forbear thinking what an happy Contrivance it wou'd be in the Managers of the  Old House  to bring this Deity upon the Stage in the same manner that he appears in these Verses Such a Performance wou'd set their Character in the most eminent Light They wou'd infallibly get the start of their ingenious Rivals and poor  Doctor Faustus  and his  Dragon  wou'd no longer be the highest Entertainment of the  Beaux Esprits  of this Age  I am got into another Part of the Poem says  Philypsus  which might serve in some measure to arm their Rivals of  LincolnsInnFields  against so formidable an Undertaking There are Passages in the  Descent into Hell  capable of furnishing out a great deal of the  Wonderful  and  Surprizing  in this way But to return can any thing be more Pathetick than this whole Book especially the latter  part when  the Heroes  come to make their Appearance Tho' I am always lost in the Variety of Beauties which we find in it I must single out the Speech of  Agamemnon  and read at least the Conclusion of it to you  When War has thunder'd with its loud est Storms  Death thou hast seen in all her ghastly forms  In duel met her on the listed Ground  When hand to hand they wound return for wound  But never have thy Eyes astonish'd view'd  So vile a deed so dire a Scene of Blood  Ev'n in the flow of joy when now the bowl  Glows in our Veins and opens ev'ry Soul  We groan we faint with Blood the dome is dy'd  And o'er the pavement floats the dreadful tyde  Her breast all gore with lamentable cries  The bleeding innocent  Cassandra  dies  Then tho' pale death froze cold in ev'ry vein  B λ'  My Sword I strive to wieldbut strive invain  Surely nothing in Nature can be conceived of greater Strength and Emotion than this Circumstance We see the Hero weltring on the Floor all cover'd with Blood and in the last agonies of Death It was then that he heard the Cries and Shrieks of the Daughter of  Priam  pursued by the Traytors and stab'd to the Heart by the barbarous  Clytemnestra  expiring as he was he endeavours to raise up his Arm and at last gets his Hand upon the hilt of his Sword which he had strength only to grasp with a look full of Rage Compassion and Revenge Methinks  Antiphaus  I see him now expired and dropt upon the Floor but tho' expired there is still that Rage and Passion in his Countenance he still grasps his Sword and seems to threaten the Traytors and the Adulteress with his looks  I know nothing finer says  Antiphaus  than these last Efforts of dying Heroes They affect the Soul wonderfully And the weakness of their Body which will not permit their acting at such times in my Opinion sets off their Courage and their Desire of Action in the strongest Light imaginable There is nothing unnatural in this tho' indeed it follows Nature to its last Pitch The best Historians as well as the first Poets make use of such Circumstances very finely and I remember Instances of it  Etiam quos vires sanguisque desereret u  intra vallum hostium  c  derent  nitebantur  Liv  vol p per  H  arne  in  Livy  and  Catilina vero longe a suis inter hostium cadavera repertus est paullulum etiam spirans ferociamque animi quam habuerat vivus in vul  u retinens  Sall Bell Cat  juxta finem  Sallust  that carry this  Matter as far as  G Aen  Virgil  or  Homer  But some Moderns as usual stretch it so immoderately that they go beyond nature and the Moment it is so it must be ridiculous How often have we laugh'd at those Rants of  Tasso  and  Ariosto  It wou'd be very well if their Heroes only  threaten'd in Death  but they must  die  Minacciava morendo e non languia  Tas  away without being at all the Weaker  some of them in the heat of Battle you may be sure  forget that they are  Il pover' huomo che non sen' era accorto Andava combattendo ed era morto  Ariost  kill'd  and so  keep on fighting  like  Strada's Soldiers  who after  they are cut in Two  Dimidiato corpore pugnabant sibi  superstites ac peremptae  partis ultores  Strad  Dec Lib  survive themselves  and fight on with that half of their Bodies that is left them to revenge the other which was knock'd on the Head an hour or two before  Such things as those answer'd  Philypsus  are not  Blemishes  in a piece they are downright  falsities  meer  outrages  against Truth as well as common sense Nothing can be invented more ridiculous they are like the  incomprehensible Lies  of Sir  John Falstaff  and put one in mind of his  fighting with  Blount  an hour by  Shrewsbury  Clock  after that Gentleman had been kill'd before very heartily by  Princ  Henry  On the contrary  Homer  is as great a friend to Truth and Nature as he is to Poetry He knows how to raise every thing as far as it will bear he ha  always a Command of whatever is prope  to be said and which is yet greater  always understands when he has sai  enough  But we forget our selves  Antiphau  this Digression has carried us so far th  if we do not soon go on with this Spee  of  Agamemnon  's which occasion'd it w  shall not know where it left off Aft  that pathetick account of his Death an  the barbarity of his Queen he proceed  Nor did my traitress Wife these Eyelids ck  Or decently in Death my Limbs compose  O Woman Woman when to ill thy Mind  Is bent all Hell contains no fouler Fiend  And such was mine who basely plung'd her sw  Thro' the fond Bosom where she reign'd ado  Alas I hop'd the toils of War o'ercome  To meet soft quiet and repose at home  D  lusive hopeO Wife thy deeds disgra  The pe  jur  d Sex and blacken all the race  And shou'd posterity one virtuous find  B λ'  Name  Clytemnestra  they will curse the ki  The turn of Expression in this is much more lively and passionate than the language of  Homer  himself As you cannot value any delays where we meet with such Improvements I am sure you will give me leave to read you the Speech of  Ulysses  just after That I mean in which he gives  Achilles  an account of his Son  Pyrrhus  's behaviour in the War  Hear with pleas'd Attention the renown  The wars and wisdom of thy gallant Son  With me from  Scyros  to the Field of Fame  R  diant in Arms the blooming Heroe came  When  Gr  ce  assembled all her Hundred States  To ripen Counsels and decide Debates  Heavens how he charm'd us with a flow of sense  And won the heart with manly Eloquence  He first was seen of all the Peers to rise  B λ'  The third in wisdom where they all wer  wise  Give me leave says  Antiphaus  interrupting himthat very Verse I have formerly taken notice of the Translator seems to me to have used an unnecessary Caution in it He is tender of making  Ulysses  commend himself  by Name  where  Homer  does it with the greatest bluntness  I know it says  Philypsus  but that I should have put to the account of his  Improvements on this Speech Cou'd any thing have been more gross than to have imitated that line in its own  coarse rustick  Dialect Is it not better on all Hands for such a Sentiment to be  imply'd  than to be  express'd  Custom and Prejudice answered  Antiphaus  have now render'd it unpolite and even shocking for a Man almost in any Case to commend himself But it was not thus anciently It is certain that it was not thus in the times of those Heroes whom  Homer  describes and  Home  therefore acts with Propriety in making  Ulysses  say that  Nestor and Himself wer  the wisest of all the Grecians  Now is the Translator in this Case to follow his Author or not Is he to preserve  the Manners  of the Ancients in the characters or his Heroes or is he to modernize them and to make  Ulysses  and  Achilles  appear the most accomplish'd finest Gentleme  in the World  That will be carrying the Matter to  far replied  Philypsus  I speak it only as to this particular and I own I am yet to be convinc'd that this Humour o  commending themselves was really s  prevalent among the Ancients Perhap  this is one of the Places where  Home  nods  it might be a slip of haste or inat+tention  No interrupted  Antiphaus  nothing can be more certain than the freedom and honesty of Speech us'd among the Ancients in this particular not only before  Homer  but very long after his timeIf  Homer's Ulysses  here calls himself the wisest of the  Grecians  his  Achilles  does not stick at calling himself  the Best and most Valiant of them  and that too in a Council of all the  Princes Virgil  has given us his Approbation of both the one and the other in making  Aeneas  talk frequently of his own piety and valour I cou'd tire you with Quotations of this kind  Socrates  in  Plato  is always brought in to his advantage and yet there he does just the same thing with  Ulysses  in the present case he himself quotes the Oracle which pronounc'd him to be  the Wisest of Men Xenophon  represents  Cyrus  upon his Deathbed as taking notice of the greatest Beauty of his own Character his Humanity in a Piece which every one knows was designed for the Character of a  perfect Prince  In a word whole Treatises  ave been wrote of this very thing and  n this very strain  Ca  sar  and the great  ewish  writer of his own Life frequently  ommend themselves the greatest Cri  ick as well as the greatest Orator among  the  Romans  who so often recko  s  Modesty  among the things which are most necessary toward rendering a Man great in his Profession how open and frequent is he in praising himself and in setting his own Merit in a true Light But what puts this beyond dispute and shews at the same time that a just Commendation of one self may by very consistent with the  greatest Modesty  is to be found in the  sacred Writings  in which  Moses  says of himself  that he was the Meekest Man upon Earth  Thus free were the Ancients in commending themselves and not to consider here whether we or they were in the right whether their  Behaviour  may not be thought to have had more of  Veracity  in it and our Method to have been grounded in a great degree on a  false Estimate  of things however that be I think enough has been said to shew that  Homer  was not  drowsy  when he wrote this line and that  Ulysses  might use it without any thing of a vitious Arrogance  To confess the Truth says  Philypsus  I was really ignorant in this point of the Usage of the Ancients and had modelled their  Manners  too much by our own I now see my error and think the Translator  might have spared the excuse which he  Note on Ver B  makes for this Indecency in  Ulysses  behaviour 'tis plain it wou'd not have been so improper before a People less noted for Vainglory than the  Phaeacians  I thank you  Antiphaus  for this new Light and shall go on with the Heroe's Character of  Pyrrhus  without thinking him so assuming as he formerly appear'd to have been After placing the Son of  Achil  es  next to  Nestor  and  Himself  in Wisdom he proceeds to give an account of his Courage and in that sets him above all the  Grecians  without Exception  But when to try the fortune of the day  Host mov'd tow'rd host in terrible array  Before the van impatient for the  ight  With martial port he strode and stern delight  When  Ilion  in the horse receiv'd her doom  And unseen armies ambush'd in its womb  Gr  ce  gave her latent warriors to my care  'Twas mine on  Troy  to pour the imprison'd war  Then when the boldest bosom beat with fear  When the stern eyes of Heroes dropp'd a tear  Fierce in his look his ardent valour glow'd  Flush'd in his Cheek or sally'd in his Blood  Indignant in the dark recess he stands  Pants for the battle and the war demands  His voice breath'd death and with a martial air  B λ'  He grasp'd his Sword and shook his glittering Spear  How well is the earnest Spirit of a young Heroe described throughout this whole Passage How does the impetuousness of his Soul appear in these previous Actions of the warrior Had one the poetical Liberty of making comparisons I shou'd not stick at sa  ing that this has a great resemblance to that admirable description of a  Warhorse  in the most finisht Poem in the World    Virgils  Georgicks  T  m siqua sonum procul arma dedere  Stare loco nescit  micat auribus tremit  rtus  C  ll  ctumque prem  s volvit sub naribus ignem  I am apt to believe that Mr  Pope  had this behaviour of  Pyrrhus  in his Eye when he gave those lively Strokes in the entrance of his  Ode for Musick  We see the Heroes there in the same Postures when animated by the martial strains o  Orpheus  Stanza  Each chief his sevenfold shield display'd  And half unsheath'd the shining blade  And Seas and Rocks and Skies re  ound  To arms to arms to arms  By the sudden flow of their Spirits  and the rapidity of their Imagination  they prevent the War  They shew a  noble forgetfulness of the Place and Circumstances of things about them and think themselves already engaging with the absent Enemy  There is one Speech more of those I mention'd at first which I cannot forbear repeating to you tho' I am sensible that I have been too long upon this Head already It is that of  Circe  to  Ulysses  in the  tenth Odyssey  Then wav'd the wand and then the word was given  Hence to thy fellows dreadful she began  Go be a BeastI heard and yet was Man  Then sudden whirling like a waving Flame  My beamy faulchion I assault the Dame  Struck with unusual fear she trembling cries  She faints she falls she lifts her weeping eyes  What art thou say from whence from whom you came  O more than human tell thy race thy name  Amazing strength these poisons to sustain  Not mortal thou nor mortal is thy Brain  Or art thou he the Man to come foretold  By  Hermes  powerful with the Wand of Gold  The Man from  Troy  who wander'd Ocean round  The Man for Wisdom's various Arts renown'd  B χ'  Ulysses  Oh thy threatning fury cease  What starts what terror and a  azement What passionate breaks are  here in these lines How solemn is the  beginning how emphatical the account of the action and how lively the surprize and con  usion of the Inchantress upon finding the inefficacy of her Charms Nature here appears in every Word that she says if the Disappointment is great and shocking the lines too are all impetuous and abrupt if the passions strong and various the Expressions in the Translation are instant and pressing and the stile often chang'd How great and swift is the Alteration from an imperious cruel Tyrant to a poor weak helpless Woman And how is it equal'd by that judicious shifting of the scene in this piece There the change is as sudden and immediate and nothing can be greater than the fall from the haughtiness of  Go be a Beast  to the meanness of the line just after  She faints she falls she lifts her weeping Eyes  You cannot but observe farther my  Antiphaus  that the lines in this description are every where improv'd with those Figures which the Ancient  Criticks  have always look'd upon as the most proper to express an hurry of Passion The  Transposition  the  Omission  of Words the pressing use of  Exclaiming  and  Interrogation  and the general  Inconnection  which runs through it are all apply'd in the most natural and poetical Manner There is a Note of the Translator on a Passage not long before this which gives us in one view several excellent Observations of this kind and which no doubt he had in his Eye here for the rules of it are exactly follow'd in the present case This Poet is the best Commentator on himself give me leave therefore just to look back for his  No  e on B Ver  Note on the Speech of  Eurylocus  that you may see how exactly those Observations tally with his performance here in every particular Article  We have here says he a very lively picture of a Person in a great frightthe very manner of speaking represents the disorder of the speaker he is in too great an Emotion to introduce his Speech by any Preface he breaks at once into it without preparation as if he could not soon enough deliver his thoughts    Again  There is nothing which gives more life to a Discourse than the taking away  from  Longinus  e Subl c  the Connections and Conjunctions when the discourse is not  bound together and embarass'd it walks and slides along of it self  Periods  thus cut off and yet pronounc'd with Precipitation are signs of a lively Sorrow which at the same time hinders yet forces him to speak    Again  in a like case  He speaks short and in broken and interrupted Periods which excellently represent the agony of his thoughtsAfterwards we see he breaks out into Interrogations which as  De  Subl  c  Longinus  observes give great motion strength and action to Discourse If the Poet had proceeded simply the Expression had not been equal to the occasion but by these short Questions he gives strength to it and shews the disorder of the speaker by the sudden starts and vehemence of the Periods  All these animated Figures all those Arts of expressing the Passions are beautifully wo  e into this single piece of Poetry But there is one peculiar Excellence in it yet behind which I admire beyond all the rest It is a power almost unknown even to Poetry before and the Criticks have not as yet found out any Name for it The extraordinary Beauty  I mean is that  Insight  which the Poet gives his Readers into  Circe's Mind  We look into her Soul and see the Ideas pass there in Train At first she is ignorant then dubious and at last discovers gradually in her Thoughts the Character and very Name of the Heroe  Circe  skill'd as she was in all the arts of Magick is limited in her Knowledge and Discovery of things and in the present Discovery of the Person of  Ulysses  her Mind acts with Tumult and Rapidity but at the same time with a series and gradual Collection of Truths at first unknown Every one may perceive the Tumult and the  successive Enlightnings  of her Mind We are led into a full View of the shifting of her thoughts and behold the various openings of them in her Soul  What art thou say from whence from whom you came  Or art thou He  the Man to come  foretold  T  e Man from Troy  The Man  for  wisdom's  various arts renown'd  Ul  sses  I never read any thing which sets the actings of another's Mind so distinctly to the view  Circe's  very Thoughts are made visible to us they are set full in our Eyes and we see the different degrees  as it were of Light breaking in upon her Soul'Tis a most charming piece of Poetry and upon turning it every way and considering all its several perfections I believe one might venture to pronounce it the most finisht Piece the most  compleat Beauty  in the whole Translation  These are the productions of a Sublime Genius and speak an uncommon Spirit together with a firm extensive Judgment and an exact Sense of things But you  Antiphaus  chiefly complain of this Writer for his Refinements and Elevation there is too much of the  Enflure  as the  French  call it in his Works and you cannot bear with such a profusion of Glitter and Embroidery in the Language I do not deny that the Passages you repeated are generally blameable on these accounts but beg leave to produce some instances which may shew the Translator to be a master in the just and proper stile as the former convince us of his Excellence in the polish'd and enliven'd and pathetick  How humble are the lines in particular  B  where  Ulysses  meets with  Minerva  in  Ithaca  and how rural the    b  B  B  Scene between him and  Eumaeus  in that Island So far that for my own Part I must confess I shou'd be more apt to imagine that Mr  Pope  on these Occasions sinks now and then into  Lownesses  beneath the dignity of the Epick than that he soars too high or uses any false Elevation  As for the just and chaste  Manner  of expressing things it is very frequent in these Passages There is a place just come into my Head in which this very way of speaking is describ'd the lines are close and expressive and according to Mr  Pope  's Method in his  incomparable Essay  are themselves the best example of the thing they treat of they are  Verse θ'  in the Eighth Book  With partial hands the Gods their gifts dispense  Some greatly think some speak with manly sense  Here Heaven an elegance of form denies  But Wisdom the defect of form supplies  This Man with energy of thought controuls  And steals with modest violence our Souls  He speaks res  rv'dly but he speaks with force  Nor can one word be chang'd but for a worse  The Conclusion of  Tiresias  's Speech to  Ul  sses  proceeded  Philypsus  I dare answer for it you will think excellent in this way  Peaceful shalt thou end thy blissful days  And steal thy self from life  by slow decays  Unknown to pain in age resign thy breath  When late stern  Neptune  points the shaft with death  To the dark grave retiring as to Rest  B  δ' to  Thy people blessing by thy people blest  By this we see how Mr  Pope  can enliven any thing of this kind with the greatest Justice and Beauty Such to mention but one more is that single Passage as I take it in all  Homer  's Works which describes the Regions of the Blest The Lines are very beautiful in the Original and the Translation has express'd all the beauties of it in a lively proper fluency of Verse  Elysium  shall be thine the blissful plains  Of utmost Earth where  Rhadamanthus  reigns  Joys everyoung unmix'd with pain or fear  Fill the wide circle of th' Eternal Year  Stern Winter smiles on that auspicious clime  The Fields are florid with unfading prime  From the bleak pole no Winds inclement blow  Mould the round Hail or flake the fleecy Snow  But from the breezy deep the blest inhale  The fragrant murmurs of the Western gale  This grace peculiar will the Gods afford  B  δ' to  To thee the Son of  Jove  and beauteous  Hel  n's  Lord  What can be more Just and Beautiful The Thought proper and  adequate  the  Words  glowing  and the Language  alive  To me the Verses themselves seem to run on with joy and pleasure The delightful Softness of those lines in  Homer  is diffus'd thro' the whole Description by Mr  Pope  and the latter has the advantage of the Original in concluding with a full elastick line that carries a Spring with it instead of the heaviness of    I entirely agree with you says  Antiphaus  as to the turn of the Lines 'Tis very fine and vigorous but methinks even in these what answers the two particular Greek Verses you have repeated are too much flourish'd and more remarkable for their Sound than for any other Idea they may give the Mind The Sense seems to be almost overlaid by the  Finesse  of them  I shall not stand with you for that Couplet answer'd  Philypsus  what I chiefly admire is the general  low of the lines in the whole Passage  This manner of writing  Antiphaus  is very assistant in expressing the nature of the Subject and indeed tho' Mr  Pope  does sometimes go too far in the Florid and Artificial we may say in general  that he is a very  natural  Writer His Imagination is lively his Colours strong and his Hand masterly in most of his strokes We shou'd lose our selves in endeavouring to observe all that variety of Beauties of this kind which are to be found in his Translation one Point I have particularly admir'd in it The Poet's peculiar Air and Happiness in drawing Landscapes especially hanging Woods Slopes and Precipices Thus  High  Ithaca  o'erlooks the Floods  B γ'  Brown with o'erarching Shades and pendent Woods  What Reader will be so unconcern'd and so little taken with this Prospect as  Ulysses  is represented to be in another Part of the Poem For 'tis the same place that we have a description of afterwards when we are told  That he  Deepmusing o'er the Mountains stray'd  Thro' mazy thickets of the woodland shade  And cavern'd ways the shaggy coast along  B  With cliffs and nodding forests overhung  In  Ulysses  's first adventures on  Phaeacia  we are led on  successively  thro' several very beautiful Descriptions First we  have a  B ε'  rocky Coast excellently pictur'd in two lines only thence we are carried into a  B to ε'  thick dark Wood for that Night The next Morning we have a  B to ζ'  View of the City The first things which offer to the Eye are the Castle and the Senatehouse rising above the other Buildings at a distance across the great Road appears the Port with the Ships at Anchor and their Sails fluttering in the Air on the Shore just by the Temple of  Neptune  you see the  Phaeacians  busied in the Dock all in their several Employments After this View you pass thro' a  B ζ'  delicious Range of Groves and Meadowground up to the Walls while on this side  B ζ'  appear the Gardens all in bloom and the Vineyards of  Alcinous  close the Scene on the other  There can be nothing better imag'd and more natural than these Descriptions are in Mr  Pope  's Translation they exceed even the Original it self  I beg leave to repeat another Description to you which lies not so diffus'd as the former 'tis one single View of  Calypso  's  Grotto and what an exact and beautiful Draught of it does it give us  A various Sylvan scene  Appears around and groves of living green  Poplars and Alders ever quivering play'd  And nodding Cypress form'd a fragrant shade  On whose high branches waving with the storm  The Birds of broadest wing their mansion form  The Chough the Seamew the loquacious Crow  And scream aloft and skim the deeps below  Depending Vines the shelving Cavern screen  With purple clusters blushing thro' the green  Four limpid fountains from the Cliff distill  And every fountain pours a sev'ral rill  B ε'  In mazy windings wandring down the Hill  Nothing can be more beautiful to the Eye than these Landscapes are in the Poem they make every thing present to us and agreeably deceive us into an Imagination that we  Longin    actually See what we only Hear  As the Poet may improve all his Circumstances at pleasure what the Criticks have observ'd in this Case is not so extravagant as one wou'd imagine we really see things more fully and with greater delight in the Poem than we shou'd in the reality The Picture improves upon Nature and we might look  on the Prospect it self with  Dionysius Hal    less pleasure than we hear it describ'd  Whoever is shock'd at this may be pleas'd to consider  the Cave of the Nymphs  in the Thirteenth Book That alone may serve to shew how largely Circumstances may be added in describing the works of Nature or in drawing poetical Prospects  Mr  Pope  shews an excellent Hand in several other Places as in the first View of  Circe  's Palace at a distance and constantly in the appearance of Land off at Sea  Ulysses  gives us an account of the former at his landing upon the Island of that Goddess  B  χ'  From the high Point I mark'd in distant view  A stream of curling Smoke ascending blue  And spiry tops the tufted Trees above  Of  Circe  's Palace bosom'd in the Grove  The other is very frequent take a Description or two of it that come into my Mind at present  B ν'  Like distant Clouds the Mariner descries  Fair  Ithaca  's emerging Hills arise  Again  B ε'  The distant Land appear'd  Then swell'd to sight  Phaeacia  's dusky coast  And woody Mountains half in vapours lost  That lay before him indistinct and vast  Like a broad Shield amid the watry waste  Nothing hath furnish'd  Homer  as well as  Virgil  with such a variety of natural Images as this Element and in nothing has Mr  Pope  more finely copied his Original But all these Beautiful Pictures are only Pictures of  still Life  this Gentleman's Excellency reaches farther he is as masterly in all his Motions and Actions he can teach his Pencil to express Ideas yet in the Mind and to paint out the Passions of the Soul  Sometimes we have all the  Imagery  in Motion If a Ship is to set sail the Canvas swells to the Eye the Streamers float in the Air and the Sailors are all full of Noise and Business  B β'  We see the Vessel move on and here the rushing sound of the Water  The attending train  Load the tall bark and launch into the main  The Prince and Goddess to the stern ascend  c  To the strong stroke at once the rowers bend  Full from the West she bids fresh breezes blow  The sable billows foam and roar below  With speed the Mast they rear with speed unbind  The spacious sheet and stretch it to the Wind  High o'er the roaring Waves the spreading Sails  Bow the tall Mast and swell before the gales  The crooked keel the parting surge divides  And to the stern retreating roll the tides  At another time you behold the Rowers drawing  B μ'  the Oar to their broad Breasts  and the different attitudes of them as they  B  bend  or  B    stretch  to the stroke  B ν'  At once they bend and strike their equal oars  And leave the sinking hills and less'ning shores  This Idea of the Land seeming to sink and recede is very beautifully added in another Place where we have the Description of a Person driving very swiftly in a Chariot I believe you will hear the entire Passage with Pleasure as it is all very Just and Natural  With hasty hand the ruling reins he drew  He lash'd the coursers and the coursers flew  Beneath the bounding yoke alike they held  Their equal pace and smoak'd along the field  The Tow'rs of  Pylos  sink its views decay  Fields after fields fly back till close of Day  B γ'  Then sunk the Sun and darken'd all the way  Along the waving fields their way they hold  B  γ'  The fields receding as the Chariot roll'd  Give me leave interpos'd  Antiphaus  to observe one thing by the way Mr  Pope  possibly to make this the more sensible to us at present deviates a little from the Truth and chuses rather to shew the  Poet  than the  Antiquary  As I take it the Horses in the Chariots of the Ancients were not  beneath the Yoke  Do not their Medals and all the Pictures of them represent it otherwise And does not the Verse here in the Original shew its Position in respect of the Horses very particularly and distinctly  However this is a slip of a small Nature and had the thing been express'd in exact Conformity to the  Grecian  fashion in this particular it might not have struck the Reader so strongly as it does now by its Agreement with the present Idea of the same thing  I am not concern'd says  Philypsus  either in defending or giving up that particular I only instance this Passage in general for its expressiveness of such an Action and of the Ideas arising in  the Mind upon it As to that  End  I believe it will hold very well The Description and Sentiment is very Natural reply'd  Antiphaus  I beg you to go on without observing any little breaks for the future which may be occasion'd by such Circumstances as do not affect the chief Aim and Design of a Quotation  If the  Poet  proceeded  Philypsus  can paint out the  Ideas  in the Mind with so much Justice as he appears to do by this instance and more particularly by another mention'd before of the successive  openings  and  unfolding  of an unknown Truth in the Mind of  Circe  we shall find him to have been equally Happy in expressing the  Passions  of the Soul Something of this has been mention'd already and almost an infinite variety of Beauties of the same kind might be added They  bound every where in the Translation and are generally well touched But there is the Description of one Passion in particular which is perserv'd throughout the whole Piece It is  Ulysses  his Love for his Country Give me leave to repeat some of the first and last Passages in which it is exprest How strongly does  Minerva  represent this even in the  ery entrance of the Poem She says the  Hero is detain'd from  Ithaca  by a Goddess nothing human cou'd have forced him into so tedious an absence by a Goddess  Who sooths to dear delight his anxious mind  Successless all her soft caresses prove  To banish from his breast his Country's love  To see the  Smoke  from his lov'd palace  ise  While the dear Isle in  distant  prospect lies  B α'  With what  contentment wou'd he close his eyes  The first Appearance of the Hero is most excellently imagined  Calypso  has just receiv'd orders to detain  Ulysses  no longer from his Country she finds him sitting alone upon the Rocks the Tears trickling down his Cheeks and his Eyes fixt upon the Sea It was thus that he pass'd his Hours in the Island of that Goddess He constantly  In slumber wore the heavy Night away  On Rocks and Shores consum'd the  edious Day  There sate all desolate and sigh'd alone  With echoing sorrows made the mountains gro  n  And roll'd his eyes o'er all the restless main  B ε'  Till dim'd with rising grief they stream'd again  Pardon me says  Antiphaus  even her  tho' the Passion be strongly set out yet the Language of the two Passages which you repeated last is not entirel  free from the old Fault the  Enflure  is still discernible That  soothing an anxious Mind to dear delight  falls short of the plainness and energy of the OriginalTo make the  Mountains groan with echoing Sorrow  is yet more overwroughtAnd  the streaming again of his Eyes  is not exactly right in the Translation which does not mention his  weeping before  at the same time that it varies from the Original which says that he  never ceas'd from weeping  We meet with another Image of this reply'd  Philypsus  in the Evening before  Ulysses  sets sail for  Ithaca  which I believe you will allow to be better express'd He was then in so delightful a Place as the Court of  Alcino  s  They had a multitude of Diversions there the  Phaea  ians  were the happiest People in the World Races and Entertainments Mirth Wine and Musick were the chief Business of their Lives  Ulysses  appears among them with a quite different  ce he looks like a Creature of an higher Make of an Order above them and his Mind is taken up with farther Views and other Desires  All but  Ulysses  heard with fixt delight  He  ate and ey'd the Sun and wish'd the Night  Slow seem'd the Sun to move the hours to roll  B ν'  His native Home deepimag'd in his Soul  We are continually put in mind of this fondness of the Hero for his Country and in the last Case it is particularly fixt upon the Reader by a very expressive  See Mr  Pope  's Note on the Place  Simile We may imagine the ardency of  Ulysses  's Love for his  Ithaca  his own  proper  Country when we consider his Affection for his Countrymen the  Grecians  in general Upon an occasional revival in his Thoughts of the Destructions and Misery they underwent before  Troy  the Hero's Dissimulation great as it was is overcome his Passion breaks through every restraint we immediately see him all in Tears This tenderness of his is painted in another Simile the most pathetick that can be conceiv'd and the most expressive of his Affection for his Countrymen    Ulysses  's griefs renew  Tears bath his cheeks and tears the ground  edew  As some fond Matron views in mortal fight  Her Husband falling in his Country's right  Frantick thro' clashing Swords she runs she flies  As ghastly pale he groans and faints and dies  Close to his Breast she grovels on the ground  And bathes with floods of  ears the gaping wound  She cries she shrieks the fierce insulting foe  Relentless mocks her violence of woe  To chains condemn'd as wildly she deplores  B θ  A widow and a slave on foreign shores  It wou'd be endless to repeat every thing of this Nature There are a Thousand sketches of it in the  Odyssey  'Tis sufficient at present to observe that Mr  Pope  generally gives them to us in very lively Colours and excells almost every where in the  Pathetick  'Tis certain says  Antiphaus  that he has an excellent Hand his Images which you have set before me are as strong as any of the Works of the Pencil They are so answered  Philypsus  and on that account you will Pardon me for borrowing so many Metaphors from Painting in this Case 'Tis unavoidable The designs of Painting and Poetry are so united that to me the Poet and the Painter seem scarcely to differ in any thing except the  Mean  they make use of to arrive at one and the same end Both are to express Nature but the Materials of the one are Words and Sound of the other Figure and Colours  Poetry  can paint more particularly more largely and with greater coherence  Painting  is  the more concise and emphatical If  This  may excell in shewing one View distinctly  That  can shew several in succession without any manner of Confusion Any figure in  Painting  is confin'd to one Attitude but  Poetry  can give as great a variety of Motion and Postures as the reality it self What seems a Paradox of Art in either is their Power of expressing two  opposite Passions  in the same face Of this sort among a Multitude of like instances is the Mother of  Lewis  the Thirteenth in the Gallery of  Luxembourg  and every Piece in that fine Episode which conc  udes the sixth  Iliad  In that  Picture  the Queens Face strongly expresses the Pain and Anguish of her Condition mix'd with a regard toward her Son full of the greatest Pleasure and Complacence In the  Poem  we have the greater variety and each piece is perfectly just and finish'd  Hector  shews a sierceness for the War and a tenderness that inclines him to stay for a last interview little  Astyanax  has a Fondness and a Terror in his Eyes a  the sight of his Father while  Andromache  's Face is all soften'd into a tende  Smile and at the same time wet with the Tears that fall for her  Hector  I remember says  Antiphaus  it was to you that I was oblig'd for the first Observation I ever met with on these  Double Passions  I have since read several things in the  Aeneid  as well as in the Works of  Homer  with a pleasure perfectly new on account of the light you then gave me into this particular And out of a Thousand Places that I have observ'd it in since I know none so beautiful as that of  Achaemenides  in  Virgil  which you mention'd to me the first time we ever talk'd of this Subject  That you know reply'd  Philypsus  to have been always my Favourite I have read it over in  Dryden  so frequently that I believe I can now repeat you his Translation of it  From the Woods there bolts before our sight  Somewhat betwixt a Mortal and a Spright  So thin so ghastly meager and so wan  So bare of Flesh he scarce resembled Man  This thing all tatter'd seem'd from far t'implor  Our pious Aid and pointed to the Shore  We look behind then view his shaggy Beard  His cloaths were tagg'd with thorns and  ilth his limbs be  mear'd  The rest in mein in habit and in face  Appear'd a  Greek  and such indeed he was  He cast on us from far a frightful view  Whom soon for  Trojans  and for foes he knew  S  ood still and paus'd  then all at once began  To stretch his Limbs and trembled as he ran  Soon as approach'd upon his knees he falls  And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls  "Now by the Pow'rs above and what we share  "From Natures common gift this vital Air  "  Dryd Transl Aen  O  Trojans  take me hence  'Tis but too evident continu'd  Philypsus  that Mr  Dryden  falls as much  hort of  Aen  Subito è sylvis macie confecta supremà  Ignoti nova forma vi  i miserandaque cultu  Pr  ced  t  supplexque manus ad litora tendit  U  i D  rdanio  habitus Troia vidit  Arma p  ocul paullum aspectu conterritus  haesi    Continuitque gradum mox  sese ad litora praec  p  Cum fletu precibusque  tulit    Virgil  in the chief turn that relates to our present purpose as  Virgil  has exceeded that  Ιλ' χ'  Passage in the  Iliad  which seems to have given him the hint for drawing this admirable Image  This Distraction of  Achaemenides  between several Passions at once puts me in mind of the dubiousness and shifting of thoughts which is illustrated by  Homer  by a very apt and expressive Simile than which says Mr  Pope  There  Note on I    is scarce any thing in the whole compass of Nature that can more exactly represent the State of an irresolute mind wavering between two different Designs sometimes inclining to the  one sometimes to the other and then moving to that Point to which its Resolution is at last determin'd  As when old Ocean's silent surface Sleeps  The Waves just heaving on the purple Deeps  While yet th' expected Tempest hangs on high  Weighs down the cloud and blackens in the sky  The mass of waters will no wind obey  Jove  sends one gust and bids them roll away  While wavering counsels thus his mind engage  Fluctuates in doubtful thought the  Pylian  sage  To join the host or to the General haste  Iliad  Debating long he fixes on the last  There is something of this  Mélange of Passions  and those too the most beautiful in this Case I mean of opposite  Passions  in that line of  Milton  where he says that Death  Grin'd horrible a ghastly smile  One wou'd almost be perswaded that  Homer  is the  dernier Ressort  of all the finest Thoughts in Poetry for this likewise is copied from him tho' it fails very much as to the Point in hand both of the Original and of Mr  Pope  's Translation of it  Juno  makes a very mutinous Speech in an assembly of the Deities The Infection took as much as she cou'd desire and that success  provok'd and inflamed as she was forced her to be somewhat pleased in spite of her self Upon this she shews a sort of  Il    uneasy satisfaction and such a Smile as  Ovid  Risus abest nisi quem visi movere dolores B  gives to his  Envy  in the  Metamorphosis  To see the gath'ring grudge in every breast  Smiles on her lips a spleenful joy exprest  While on her wrinkled front and eyebrow bent  Pope  's Iliad B  Sate stedfast care and lowring discontent  This struggle of Passions has been imitated by some Moderns The first of the  French  Writers in Tragedy has a fine Occasion for it in the Wife of one of the  Horatij  she was Sister at the same time to the  Curiatij  so that you may imagine how she must be distracted between the Interest of the two Cities and that eminent contest which so particularly involv'd the two Families She is introduc'd upon that Occasion speaking to this purpose  Albeoû  'ay commencè de respirer le jour  Albe mon cher pais mon premier amour  Lors qu' entrenous toy je voi la guerre ouverte  Je crains nostre victoire au  ant que nostre perte  Corneille    Alba  my dearest Country Why cou'd fate  Mark ou  no other foe for  Rome  but  Alba  From our Defeat what Terror must I feel  And yetI dread our Victory  There are many things in  Virgil  's fourth  Aeneid  which might be produc'd on this Occasion but 'tis more to our present Subject to consider that part of the  Odyssey  from which some of its finest strokes are borrow'd  Calypso  when she acquaints our Hero with the design of his departure from her Island upon his doubting her sincerity swears very solemnly that her Resolutions are real the next moment she falls into a Speech full of Insinuations and Arguments to detain him both these speeches may rather be said to be  enliven'd  and  improv'd  than to be  well translated  by Mr  Pope  this only wou'd be too narrow a Commendation of themThe first runs thus  How prone to doubt how cautious are the wise  But hear Oh Earth and hear Ye sacred Skies  And thou Oh  Styx  whose formidable floods  Glide thro' the shades and bind th' attesting Gods  No form'd design no meditated end  Lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend  Kind the perswasion and sincere my aim  The same my practise were my fate the same  Heaven has not curst me with a heart of steel  B ε'  But giv'n the sense to pity and to feel  One wou'd think now that the Goddess was to do nothing but to advise about his Voyage and the Conveniencies for it but her Passions immediately veer about and the very next Page the very next time she speaks is all in a strain entirely opposite to what she has been saying in this  Ulyss  s  with a sigh she thus began  O sprung from Gods in wisdom more than Man  I  then thy home the passion of thy heart  Thus wilt thou leave me are we thus to part  Farewel and ever joyful may'st thou be  Nor break the transport with one thought of me  But ah  Ulysses  wert thou giv'n to know  What fate yet dooms thee yet to undergo  B ε'  Thy heart might settle in this scene of ease c  I must not forget here that the fines  of the modern  Italian  Poets has express'd this  Melange  on an occasion which is attended with such a Circumstance as exceeds any of the other The particular in which he shews it shews at the same time the  swiftness  of the intervening passion and expresses the strongest of any how immediately one flow of Spirits succeeds upon a former and quite contrar  emotion  Armida  deserted by her  Rinaldo  breaths nothing but fury and revenge  she pursues him in the heat of the battle forgetful of her former passion she aims an arrow at his heart but see while it is yet in its flight how the passions vary on her face her rage and fury soften into tenderness and apprehensions of his danger in an instant her Love is too strong for her Resentment in an instant she dreads least her Design shou'd be effectual and longs to be disappointed in her aim  a  Swift flies the shaft as swiftly flies her pray'r  That all its vehemence be spent in air  How finely are the Passions blended in this piece the Transition from the extremity of fury to an excess of love is manag'd in such a manner as to be wholly  nsensible as when two Colours are lost  n the Shades of each other the Eye is  greeably deceived and we are delight  d with the delicacy of their Union  o' unable to discover where one com  ences or the other ends  In this particular there is not any  ing that can equal Poetry or bear to  compared with it except its sister  t of Painting that might copy every  Lo stral  volo  ma  con lo strale  un voto bito usci che vada il colpo a voto  Tasso  instance I have mention'd here And certainly what makes so beautiful a Figure in the finest Poets might deserve the imitation of the best Painters Was not the  Dolon  and  Calypso  of  Homer  worthy the hand of a  Zeuxis  or  Parrhasius  a  Protogenes  or  Apelles  Wou'd not the  Aruns  or  Achaemenides  of  Virgil  have been a fine design even for  Raphael  and  Angelo  to have work'd upon If our  Shakespear  can give us the struggle of Passions in the Breast of  Coriolanus Thornhill  might trace the same and speak them as well with his Pencil And if  Corneille  expresses the contrary desires of the sister of the  Curiatij  his Countryman  Le Brun  might have had a much finer Subject in the various Passions of the  Sabines  rushing in amidst the two contending Armies to prevent those fatal Consequences in which the Victory of either party must necessarily involve them  But what I have often thought of as the finest Subject of this kind either for Poetry or Painting is the first  Bru  us  on the Judicial seat just before the act of giving Sentence on his  own Sons  for their treachery to the  Commonwealth  What a noble strife was there betwee  natural Affection and the Love of one'  Country between Duty and Desire  between common Humanity and the Spirit perhaps the Pride of a  Roman  What a fine Groupe of Figures wou'd the Suppliants for the Criminals compose in such a Piece On one side of the Tribunal the  Wife  of the Judge and  Mother  of the Offenders and all the Relations divided in the same manner between a desire of moving Pity and an abhorrence of the very Crime for the Pardon of which they wou'd intercede The People of  Rome  on the other side with looks full of mixt Passions some struck with Pity amidst all their severity some almost condemning and yet approving at the same time the rigid justice of the Father while others commiserate the Youth of the Sons and seem incens'd at the  unnatural impartiality  of the Judge  'Tis a Misfortune that  Virgil  's Hand was withheld from launching farther  Aen    where he has touch'd upon this Subject but it wou'd be well made up to us if any eminent Person in the other Art wou'd undertake it It might certainly make a finisht Piece and Painting in this particular wou'd have the advantage of Poetry as it could express this  Mélange  of passions directly and wou'd strike the mind with them in their proper Union all at once whereas when taken from  the  Poetical Picture  the combination is not so easy and we scarce ever conceive it so closely as we ought  Were you to give me full scope I shou'd carry the r  semblance between these Arts much farther than it has ever yet been carried There is scarce a  Figure  or  Manner  in Poetry which I shou'd not imagine to have its tally in the Schools of the Painters I cou'd find it even in the very next point which comes in my way in the  Emphatical  Natural Descriptions as they are Pictures which take in the various Circumstances of a place or action give us generally several Groupes of finisht Figures This on the contrary is a way of expressing Nature in Poetry not unlike Outlines and Sketches in Painting and as the lines in Sketches are  fewer  but the more  distinct  this must be always  concise  and very  expressive  There are several masterly strokes of the  Emphatical  kind in the  Odyssey  Such is that Speech of  Telemachus  where he says  Prepar'd I stand He was but born to try  B γ'  The  lot  of Man  To suffer and to die  Such is  Circe  's whole speech  B to  which  I repeated to you before on account of its  Pathos  Such in an high degree is the first rencounter of the Hero with that Goddess  Hence to thy Fellows Dreadful she began  B χ'  Go be a BeastI heard and yet was Man  This  Manner  is necessary in all  Sententious  passages and  moral  reflections 'tis often strong in expressing the  passions  and peculiarly useful in the  Sublime  Take an instance of each from Mr  Pope  B ξ'  Pyrates and conquerors of harden'd mind  The foes of peace and scourges of mankind  To whom offending Men are made a prey  When  Jove  in vengeance gives a land away  E  'n these when of their illgot spoils possess'd  Find sure tormentors in the guilty breast  Some voice of God close whispering from within  "Wretch this is Villany and this is Sin"  The reflection upon seeing  Agamemnon  in  Ades  is of this kind  B λ'  Now all  Atrides  is an empty shade  Just after  Atrides  speaks thus passionately in the account of his own Death by the treachery of  Aegisthus  B λ'  But not with me the direful Murther ends  These These expir'dTheir crime they were my friends  In the  Sublime  nothing can be higher than the language of his Gods  Neptun  and  Jupiter  B ν'  If such thy WillWe will it  Jove  replies  This latter is that short full way of Expression so frequent in  Naviget Aen  Virgil  and      Homer  copied perhaps by both from the admired Example of it in  The great  Fiat  Moses  and grown since into an  Dem Phal    Axiom  among the Criticks It is the more to be commended in Mr  Pope  because the turn  e gives the Line is perfectly his own Indeed in every one of these instances as I take it the Chief of their strength and emphasis is owing to the Improvements in the Translation  Antiphaus  cou'd scarce imagine that these were all clear improvements upon  Homer  He immediately consulted the passages in the Original and was surpriz'd to find how far they fell short of the Translation especially in the line  that answer  Circe  's  threat  and the  complaint of Agamemnon  I am pleas'd says he beyond measure in consulting these parts of the Poem to see how much strength and force there is added to them have you not observ'd more instances of this kind impart them to me good  Philypsus  'Tis no matter for method or regularity Give them to me immediatelyHad I time answer'd  Philypsus  I cou'd find out several other places which have all their proper improvements at present I shall refer you to the beginning of  Menelaus  his speech to  Telemachus  in the Fourth  Odyssey Nestor  's  V γ'  in the Third and in the Tenth the speeches between  Ulysses  and  Circe  I was going to point out some passages in the  Book  Descent into Hell  but 'tis difficult to single out particular beauties from that book The whole of it is so excellently Translated and I believe I may say so generally improv'd  The mentioning  Circe  just now puts me in mind of another passage 'Tis where  Homer  describes the Metamorphosis of the companions of  Ulysses  They had says he the Shape and the Voice of  Beasts    but their Mind remain'd firm and unalter'd  this Mr  Pope  improves into the following lines  B  Still curst with sense their mind remains alone  And their own voice affrights them when they groan  The addition here is very Natural and full of Beauty in such changes particularities of this kind strike us very much  Virgil  touches them on this Occasion  Qu  mvis collo timuisset aratrum E  s  pe in laevi quaesisset cornua fronte  E  l    with his usual happiness and  Conata queri mugitus edidit ore Pertimui  que sonos  propriaque ex  rrita voce est M  t    Ovid  who has shown a particular talent for such subjects has left us the very same thought with this of Mr  Pope  I remember that Mr  Pope  appear'd to me upon my first reading his Translation to have improv'd much upon the Original in his  Poetical Repetitions  of the same word the Figure in which he is most frequent Thus is it us'd in the following lines  A Scene where if a God shou'd cast his sight  B ε'  A God might gaze and wander with delight  B β'  Never  Never  wicked man was wise  B β'  Here or in  Pyle  In  Pyle  or here your foe  And in these other very Pathetical  B β'  Then stay my ChildStorms beat and rolls the Main  Oh beat those Storms and roll the Seas in vain  'Tis yet more beautiful when the Repetition holds farther as in this Passage  B θ'  Transported with the song the listning train  Again  with loud applause demand the strain  Again Ulysses  veil'd his pensive head  Again  unman'd a show'r of Sorrow shed  This sometimes gives an additional solemnity and rises stronger and stronger each Line  Celestial as thou art yet stand deny'd  O  swear that oath by which the Gods are ty'd  Swear  in thy soul no latent frauds remain  B χ'    Swear  by the vow which never can be vain  This is sometimes carried yet farther and in  Virgil  particularly there is a fine Instance of this sort of Repetition  Saevus amor docuit natorum sanguine  matrem  Commaculare manus  Crudelis  tu quoque mater  Crudelis mater magis an puer improbus ille  Improbus ille puer crudelis tu quoque mater  v  being doubled  But in nothing is this figure more beautiful than in the  B μ'  Siren's Song  That Piece of antient Musick is greatly enliven'd in the Translation the whole flows on in a peculiar Harmony and the Chorus is very happily added in the Conclusion of it  Celestial musick warbles from their tongue  And  thus  the sweet deluders tune the song  O stay oh Pride of  Greece Ulysses  stay  O cease thy course and listen to our lay  Blest is the Man ordain'd our voice to hear  The song instructs the soul and charms the ear  Approach thy soul shall into raptures rise  Approach and learn new wisdom from the wise  We know whate'er the Kings of mighty name  Atchiev'd at  Ilion  in the field of fame  Whate'er beneath the sun's bright journey lies  O stay and learn new wisdom from the wise  The peculiar justice and propriety of this is the manner in which these Goddesses apply to  Ulysses  B μ'  by offering him knowledge a thing the most opposite to their own Complexion and a motive the most likely to obtain upon that Hero Mr  Pope  has shewn his taste and his judgment very much in improving so finely upon this Circumstance but what runs through the whole is that musical enliven'd turn of the Verses This is  b  See  Pope  's Note on the Place  the happiness which of all things I admire in this writer either in prose or verse he has the finest flow that can be imagin'd I have often heard a very good Critick say That  whenever he is reading any Prose of Mr  Pope  's he cannot help thinking that he should never have wrote any thing else and whenever he reads his Verses he is angry with him for losing any time from them for Prose  How often has the same Gentleman apply'd to this writer those Lines in  Milton  in which he speaks of the first Poet as well as the first of Men    Paradise lost B  Such prompt Eloquence  Flows from his lips In Prose or numerous Verse  More tuneable than needed Lu  e or Harp  To add more sweetness  Among so many excellencies the repeating those Lines which make the Chorus of this  Song of the Sirens  is not the least beautiful Circumstance there are a Multitude of other passages which deserve to be mention'd on account of the fine  Repetitions  in them these are what fell into my thoughts at present and you have them in the same scatter'd manner that they appear there But one method of Improvement in this Translation I took  particular notice of and in that I can be a little more full and distinct  Mr  Pope  has a very great happiness in  Transferring Beauties  He often guides his Translation of  Homer  by some fine thought or good expression in any other eminent writer and this has been the occasion of several improvements in that work  Have you never observ'd how he introduces the Elegance of  Virgil  into the Majesty of  Homer  There are two  B  speeches of  Circe  which have much of the air of that of  Proteus  in the fourth  Georgick  and that of the  Sybill  's in the sixth  Aeneid  The speech of  B Aen c  Tiresias  is improv'd from another of the  Sybill  so also is the Prophetical speech in the  V  second  Odyssey  There are several Imitations in a shorter compass of natural Images and the like introduc'd into  Homer  from the same treasury Thus the following Lines  B  Downsunk the Heavy beast  B Aen  Laestrigonia  's gates arise distinct in air  B  The shores like mists arise  B Aen  And all above is Sky and Ocean all around c  Although the Translator adds these fine strokes from other Hands they are brought in so naturally that they seem to spring out of  Homer  's sentiment And if an Instance or two shou'd be found among them which may vary a little from the Original it is only to add some apposite Thought that is not only finer but at the same time perfectly agreeable to the Subject In such cases a Translator may demand the greater liberty of enlarging as a  Flattering Resemblance  is always allow'd to Painters I like that  ery ingenious Friend of yours who calls  he  French  Translation of  Tacitus La  lle Infidelle  That piece you know  ho' not very precise and constant to its  uthor is the more beautiful and the  ore engaging  However 'tis seldom that Mr  Pope  va  es much in these additional Beauties  s Translation is generally faithful even  here it improves upon  Homer  And he  eps the chief mark steadily in his Eye  o' at the same Time it admits the side  ances of Light from other objects  hus you will scarce ever find him de  ting from his Author in such cases  o' this manner of improving him by  itation from others is vastly frequent  d often so plain that one may trace it  thro' whole scenes together In particular I cou'd almost be positive that Mr  Pope  read over the  Eclogues  of  Virgil  before he set about that Part of the Story which lies between  Ul  sses  and  Eumaeus  and indeed I should be apt to conjecture that he usually read those Pastorals before he sat down to any rural Scene in this Piece If I am mistaken in this 'tis the  From  Virgil  B B See also B Aen B B B  B B B c  resemblance of their beauties which has deceiv'd me  Sometimes we find the  Diction  beautified by such Resemblances or the Sentiment improv'd from other hands From the  Scripture  B B B  B B B B  B And frequently in other pl  ces  Sacred Writings  frequently from parallel places in  Iliad  B  c  Ovid  B B B B  S  neca  B  Horace  B  B  Homer  himself From  Ovid Seneca Horace  c among the Ancients And from  Dryden  B  B  c  Addison  B B    Dryden Addison  Milton  and several others of the most celebrated Moderns In his  Speeches  we meet with improvements from the Examples and Rules of the Orators of old and many from our own Dramatick pieces It wou'd not be difficult for a Man of a good Taste to discern the Air sometimes of  Dryden  sometimes of  Shakespear  B  B c  Shakespear  and at others of  Otway  among the speeches in the  Odyssey  I shall only point out to you those of  Agamemnon  which are so very pathetick in the  See Book V And to    Eleventh Book You will easily see that they have a new manner which exceedingly resembles the hand of the most moving of all our Tragick Writers since  Shakespear  Antiphaus  upon consulting the passages immediately perceiv'd the spirit of  O  way  in them He then desired  Philypsus  to direct him to the other imitations he had mention'd at first he did not think they deserv'd so much commendation but when he came to Compare the original Lines from the  Odyssey  with those of Mr  Pope  he was convinc'd of their  B  And frequently in other places  beauty It delighted him to see what Foundation the Original gave for such a turn and yet how new that turn was in the Translation he found almost in every one of them some addition for the better and scarce in any a deviation from the sense of  Homer  It was  Homer  's sense but the Expression of it was improv'd I thank you says he turning to  Philypsus  I thank you for this clearer view you have given me of the beauties of this Translation beside these last how many things have you repeated to me that are extremely just pure close and  emphatical  how many perfectly true and  natural  how many handsomly beautified and  enliven'd  what  Pictures  of Things what  Descriptions  of Actions and what beautiful Expressions both of the  thoughts  and of the  passions  of the soul in a word what  improvements  in some strokes upon the greatest Genius of the WorldYes added  Philypsus  upon the greatest Genius of the World assisted by the native use of the most Noble and most Poetical of all Languages Then were we to consider the inconveniences on the other side the general difficulties of Translation  and the difficulty o  this in particular How hard is it for  Poet to keep up his spirit and flame in  another's Work and how natural to  lag in representing Thoughts not our own To maintain the vigour of Language and the poetick warmth thorough so long a work and to express the Soul of  Homer  what a Genius does it require what Spirit wou'd not sink under so large an undertaking Yet does Mr  Pope  hitherto sustain his Character in an handsome equal manner and we may safely promise ourselves the same of the remaining part of this work As he enter'd upon this stage with the greatest expectations of all Men I doubt not but he will leave it with an Universal  Plaudite  But however great and handsome his performance is in the whole I own with you that it has its faults the common marks of Humanity Yes my  Antiphaus  you convinc'd me the former Evening that it is unavoidable for the greatest Genius not to fail sometimes For my  art says  Antiphaus  I shall make no Apologies for the freedoms with which I then us'd this excellent writer Any  hing of that kind might look odd to you  rom one whose constant Sentiment you  now to be this  that  the kindest way of  mmending a writer is to find fault with  im now and then at proper intervals  oes not this evince an Impartiality in  your views and add an air of Sincerity and Justice to those Commendations which you give him Your Criticks who extol a Man Universally and will not be satisfied with any thing under a  er  ect Character without any the least defect are a kind of  Romantick Criticks  they are rather making an Hero than describing a Man They give you a Picture of something which exists no where but in their own Minds and a compleat Poet according to their representations of such will after all be only what the Earl of  Mulgrave  calls it  A  aultl  ss Monster which the world ne'er saw  Very true says  Philypsus  that sort of Criticks  ail as much on one hand as  u  more Modern Criticks have excee  ed usually on the other Indeed the former err on the goodnatur'd side yet both of them are very much to blame For as it shews a  mischievous  sort of  Frenz  to start errors where there are really none  so an Obstinacy not to see  aults where they are very evident requires either a good degree of  Ignorance  or a most  inveterate Fondness  I am entirely of your opinion says  Antiphaus  and since I find you in such a  temper for it I cou'd almost of  er to shew you some farther remarks on that side of the QuestionHave you any other then says  Philypsus  A Few answer'd  Antiphaus  but I beg one Evening more on this Topick At present I shall only add my wishes that we may constantly use thisfair method in reading all the celebrated Pieces which come out among us Let us keep up the true ballance and not suffer ourselves to be prejudic'd either by too great fondness or too violent dislike This is the great Rule of Antient Criticism  Always to keep our Hearts open to the beauties of a Poem and never to shut our Eyes against the defects of it  An ESSAY c  EVENING the THIRD  _ALMOST all the next day  Philypsus  was taken up in reflecting on what had been said at the close of their last meeting he began to be not so uneasy as usual in thinking that the faults of a favourite Poet were to be lookt into that Evening he did not value Mr  Pope  less than formerly but he was throughly convinc'd that there was not so much of severity in this Method as he had once imagin'd "No says h  to himself Let us view impartially that we may rationally admire Where before I was immediately in love with his  eauties and fond of the Work I now  feel an equal Pleasure and an equal Esteem but it is in a different manner I now seem to see the causes that move me to be pleas'd with those fine Passages and feel a more just and manly Satisfaction in them 'Tis true the Soul is not hurried away with that vehemence of delight as formerly but the agreeable Sense I now have from them is both more refin'd and more lasting How much is this  rational  way of admiring to be prefer'd to the common vulgar  passionate  one This is as a flash of Lightning but the other is like the Light of the Day 'Tis a serene dif  us'd steady light which at the same time that it discovers all Objects to us is it self the most beautiful of any  But then continued he how blind was I to the defects of this Poet Has not  Antiphaus  shown me several which before I had no sense of and which now appear evidently to be such Indeed that oversight was more excusable in reading the Works of this celebrated Writer than it wou'd have been in any other Reason may well lose something of her Liberty when she is taken up with an Object every way so agreeable and engaging However for the future I resolve to keep my self obstinately from  being overpleas'd with any thing and to read his as all other the best Pieces in spight of all their Beauty by that Rule which  Antiphaus  has laid down  With these Thoughts he open'd the Translation which lay on his desk and was very busy in considering it when Company came in and interrupted him for that Night The next Day he employ'd himself in the same manner This sort of view was new to him and of course the more agreeable Sometimes he met with a line or two that disgusted him a little but much more frequently was he struck with the Beauties of the Poem and those he enjoy'd with a full Delight as he found that Delight to be rational and just This search drew him on strangely he did not know how to leave off And tho'  Antiphaus  stay'd for the Evening before he wou'd disturb him he found him still closely employ'd at it "My  Philypsus  says he I'm glad to see you engag'd thus in the  Odyssey  What new light shall we have into the excellencies of this writer Have not you been collecting other Beauties out of the TranslationI have met with several other reply'd  Philypsus  So many indeed that it wou'd be almost endless to collect them But to tell you the Truth  my business was quite contrary to what you imagine I was upon a more difficult task I was endeavouring to try what Faults I cou'd discover in it That is by much the more difficult says  Antiphaus  The few Faults of that Piece are scarce discernible among such a superiour number of Beauties How seldom do we perceive the disagreeableness of a single feature in a Face that is very taking in the whole Well but have you been able to overcome this Difficulty can you discover any thing farther of this kind in the  Odyssey  Very little answer'd  Philypsus  There is but one point yet that has afforded me any number of Instances And that is a Fault directly opposite to what you particularly insisted upon in our first Conversation on this Subject  It was then you know that we consider'd several Points in which Mr  Pope  appears to Elevate and Flourish too much Have you never observed on the contrary that there are a few  Lownesses  in his Writings and that he sometimes sinks into a Diction which borders on the  Mean  and  Vulgar  I have reply'd  Antiphaus  in some few lines but if you have made any remarks of that kind I beg rather to see those of your observation  The two Friends were always ready to comply with the desires of each other  Philypsus  as usual without prefacing or debating the matter immediately shew'd him the following Lines  B χ'  A Gallant leader and  a man I lov'd  B  γ'  The  old man  early rose walk'd forth and sate  On polish'd stone before his palace gate  B λ'  Or has Hell's Queen an empty image sent  That wretched I might even my joys lament  B χ'  Struck at the word my very heart was dead  B β'  Euryclea  who great  Ops  thy lineage shar'd  And watch'd all Night all Day a faithful guard  B ξ'  They led me to a good Man and a wi  e  B γ'  And sure he will for wisdom never lies  In the note upon this line says  Philypsus  we have a couplet repeated from the  Iliad  which I fear is of the same stamp  Iliad ι'  Who dares think one thing and another  ell  My soul detests him as the gates of Hell  I must confess says  Antiphaus  that the Lines you have repeated carry a mean ai  with them but possibly what looks like a fault may really be a beauty in some of them  Some subjects require a simplicity of stile Beside Mr  Pope  is to follow  Homer  and shou'd  Homer  use an humble stile in these places even to appearance improperly yet one should be apt to look upon it as a sufficient justification of his translator  For my part reply'd  Philypsus  I have always thought that there is a wide difference between an  humble  and a  mean  stile but not to urge any thing of that kind in the greater part of the instances just repeated I am certain there is not a sufficient likeness between the manner of the Original and the Translation  I shall only except the two last which  re indeed plain and proverbial in the  reek  There is a simplicity as Mr  P  pe  tells us in his notes a noble simpli  ity in the diction and which in my  pinion is not Equally kept up in the  English  but those I shall not insist upon  As for the rest that mean close of the  rst of these Lines is in  Homer  an      Handsome sentiment deliver'd in a sounding  verse and the meanest Expression in the second      is poetical in the Original The same will hold in some degree of the other Lines As it happens Mr  Pope  in his  B  Observation XVIII  Note upon one of them  They led me to a good Man and a wi  e  has given us this prose translation of the same words  The Gods guided me to the habitation of a person of wisdom  Now it might be thought a rude question to ask whether is the more  poetical  his  prose  or  verse  Translation of this Line  Indeed where  Homer  leads the way the case is very different I cannot say how far it might be justifiable to blame a Translator for following his Author and it was for that very reason that I shou'd not have taken any notice of the  delightful History of the Coat and Cloak  which is given us in one of the longest speeches in the Fourteenth  Odyssey  But we have several instances of  additional Lownesses  I observ'd particularly that they were pretty frequent when the Scene is in  Ithaca  Thus  His task it was the wheaten loaves to lay  B ξ'  And from the banquet take the bowls away  Again  But if to honour lost 'tis still decreed  B α'  For you my bowl shall flow my flocks shall bleed  Again  B β'  Is this returns the Prince for mirth a time  When lawless gluttons riot mirth's a crime c  The meanness here interpos'd  Antiphaus  is occasion'd by a just design that of writing in a stile agreeable to the simplicity of the subject In several other places it has a less excusable rise I mean the labour and difficulty of Rhime The Poet's being in haste to get this drudgery off his Hands sometimes draws him into the use of Expressions which are flat and contemptible Thus I believe we may account for the Lownesses in these Couplets  While with my single ship  adventurous    B ι'  Go forth the manners  of yon Men to try  Meanwhile the Gods the dome of  Vulcan throng  B θ'  Apollo  comes and  Neptune  comes  along  When great  Alcides  rose  B θ'  And  Euritus  who  bad the Gods be fo  You need only read over one single passage to guess how frequently the sense may be lessen'd and broke by this means and how often we are put off with low wretched words merely for want of a more generous Rhime  You remember the Speech of  Ulysses  when shipwrack'd in his voyage from  Calypso  's Island 'tis transfer'd you know by  Virgil  into his storm and both are very strong and animated This is the passage which I beg lea  e to read to you from Mr  Pope  Happy thrice happy who in battle slain  Prest in  Atrides'  cause the  Trojan  plain  Oh had I dy'd before  that w  llfought wall  Had some distinguish'd day renown'd my fall  Such as was that when show'rs of j  v'lins  fl  d  From conquering  Troy  around  Achill  sd  ad  All  Greece  had paid my solemn fun'rals  th  n  And spread my glory with the sons of men  A shameful fate now hides my  h  pl  ss head  Unwept unnoted and  for ever dead  A mighty wave rush'd o'er him as he spoke  The raft it cover'd and the mast it broke  Sw  pt  from the deck  and from the rudder  torn  Far on the swelling surge the chief was  born  While by the howling tempest  rent in twain  Flew sail and sailyards ratling o'er the main  Long press'd he heav'd beneath the  weighty wav    Clog'd by the cumbrous vest  Cal  pso  gave  A  length emerging from his  nostrils wide  And gushing mouth effus'd the briny tide c  The meanness of this passage in comparison  either of the original  Greek  or of  Virgil  's imitation of it which the  English  Translator I doubt not had in his eye appears to be in a great measure owing to a poverty of Rhime It has given a low turn to the whole passage and that  lowness  is still most evident in the  terminating  of the Lines  There are a Thousand other things resum'd  Philypsus  which contribute to the meanness of stile even a desire to avoid it will occasion it 'Tis not uncommonly seen that the straining to elevate a point will make it really the more mean and ridiculous as nothing shews the littleness of a dwarf more than strut  ng  One wou'd be apt to suspect this to be the case in the following verses  B λ'  There fi  s Skydy'd a pu  ple hue disclose  There  d  gling pears  exalted scents unfold  And  y  llow apples ripen into gold  And in these other  B α'    Lur'd with the  vapour  of the fragrant feast  rush'd the suitors with  vor  cious h  ste  Sometimes one single word will lessen  the sentiment and break in upon the dignity of verse Thus where the  Greek  call's  Memnon The glorious Son of Aurora  we find it in the Translation only  B    Swarthy Memnon  This by sinking below the Original it may be as faulty to stick too close to it  B Note  Hogherd and Cow  eeper  says Mr  Pope  in one of his Notes  are not to be used in our Poetry tho' there are no finer words than those which answer them in the  Greek  language  for the same reason I shou'd think that the use of the word  B c  S  y  which occurs so often in the Tenth Book might be varied and in t  e Sixth  B ζ'  In general what do you think  B γ'  of  Scudding before the gales to Pylos  of a  B  sore Soul  and of  B  γ'  Sacrificing throngs  are not these Expressions to low for verse and is it not too low and rustick even for prose to talk of  the  B  swelling loins  of a Goddess  or of  a Nymph's  Ibid  pacing  along the Sand  Your Instances reply'd  Antiphaus  sufficiently shew that beside the inconvenience of Rhime Mr  Pope  does sometimes without that wrong Biass deviate into a meanness of Expression They are directly contrary to his usual Spirit There is a case says  Philypsus  just come into my Head which ought not to be forgot we may see by it on the other hand how much this Gentleman can improve upon expressions in the Original beyond the other translators of  Homer  That venerable old Poet uses a phrase which tho' I do not believe it to have been mean in his times does most certainly sound so in the present In speaking of a Person entirely lost in melancholly he says that he was continually    Il    eating up his own Mind  So great a Man as  Cicero  has endeavour'd to give this in  Ipse suum cor edens  T  sc Quaest  lib  Latin  but with that usual unhappiness which attended him in all his Poetry In another part of  Homer  we have the same manner of Expression and it is as meanly translated by several Hands The Passage is a part of  Ju  iter  's Speech to  Juno  in which to set out the violence of her hatred to  Priam  and his family the God says that  she wou'd  Il  δ'  eat them or swallow them up quick Actius Labeo  a wretched tho' a Court writer translated several Books of the  Iliad  into  Latin  and if we may guess at the rest by the only Verse left us of that Work which as it happens answers this very Line we have no great Reason to lament the loss of it This an old Scholiast has preserv'd for a taste of the Performance  Crudum manduces  Priamum Priamique  pisinnos  Labeo  as Mr  Pope  observes in his Note upon the  Il  B  place is equal'd by  Ogilby  Both King and People thou woudst eat alive  As is  Ogilby  by  Hobbs  And eat up  Priam  and his people all  Such a general meanness in giving us this Expression of the  Greek  Poet must make us look upon Mr  Pope  with the greater regard if he can keep it from sinking in  English  This he has not only done but gives it to us in an handsome poetical turn  Let  Priam  bleed if yet thou thirst for more  Il  B  Bleed all his sons and  Ilion  float with gore  This expresses the full sentiment and that with an air of greatness and majesty in it 'Tis now Language not unfit to be put into the mouth of  Jupiter  Antiphaus  was extremely pleas'd to see so great a change in  Philypsus  and that suddain as it was it had not affected him in the usual manner As Men generally run from one extreme to the other he was afraid that the making him sensible of the Faults of the Translator might give him some distaste to his beauties but as he found he was fall'n into the Indifferent just manner of Reading he thought he might now safely go on with him farther in the same way "The defect says he which you have prov'd in some particulars on Mr  Pope  is sufficiently recompenc'd by his Flame and Spirit and the general beauty of his diction 'Tis from this Quarter that I am still the most apprehensive of Faults in that Gentleman's compositions Surely says  Philypsus  you have nothing more to produce on that head Yes reply'd  Antiphaus  I have a word or two to add to what we observ'd upon it the other Night There are a sort of Verses very frequent in our modern writers which run very smoothly off the Tongue the stream is easy but there is neither depth nor  clearness in it The truth of it is they are undisturb'd with Meaning And their calmness is  as the calmness of the Night which is  dark  withal  If I might have leave I should call such verses as these  Unideal Verses  and I fear there are some few of them to be met with in the  Odyssey  Pray observe what an unthinking harmony there is in this couplet which comes first into my Head  B ζ'  Soft he reclines along the murm'ring Seas  Inhaling freshness from the fanning breeze  And what a Panegyrick in this  Every Eye  B    Gaz'd as before some brother of the sky  I will read you but a few more  B β  The Royal Palace to the Queen convey  And  B ν'  Plan with all thy arts the scene of fate  B  Of deathful arts expert his Lord employs  The ministers of blood in dark surprise  But among all of them upon comparing the Original and the Translation this seems to be the  nonpareil  B δ'    Then warp my voyage on the Southern gales  O'er the warm  Lybian  wave to spread my sails  Mr  Pope  has had a Critique on some Lines of his  Iliad  which is chiefly taken up in discovering or making  False English  of them If this can neither darken the Line nor affect the Sense considerably it seems to me not to be of any concern in Comparison of the former  finesses  The antient Criticks were much kinder on this head and 'tis hence that we owe many of our Figures in  Rhetorick  to Peccadillo's against  Grammar  I am the most unfit in the World to determine in this Case because I have alway found my self  aver  e to t  e  Grammatical  ort of Criticism as I am fond of the  Poetical  but I am apt to think that there are not many faults of this kind justly chargeable on the  Odyssey  Of the few which I have by chance observ'd the chief are to be met with in the close of his verses Thus it occurrs if I remember right twice or thrice in that short passage which I re  eated to you the other Evening on the Transformation of  Ulysses  This Rhime  Philypsus  is a terrible Thing it has  poil'd more LinesGood  Antiphaus  cry'd  Philypsus  hastily be not so inveterate against Rhime does not it soften and beautify verse and turn poetry into a sort of musick to a good EarI am not Universally an Enemy to Rhime you know return'd  Antiphaus  It does very well in  Odes  and  Sonnets  to  Armida  But for any thing very solid or pathetick surely 'tis an Ornament too comtemptible as well as too much abus'd The first Piece of  Latin  Rhime I know of that famous  Stanza  of  Adrian  does well enough 'twas spoke out of pure Gaiety and good Humour but to introduce it gravely into poetry as it was the effect of a miserable de  rav'd taste  so will the productions of those Ages shew how happily it succeeded The  Runick  Lays answer'd  Philypsus  I do not pretend to admire but surely you will allow it to hav  succeeded better in our Language than it did in the hands of that monkish Cla  of Poets 'Tis true says  Antiphaus  smiling we have not improv'd it yet int  middle Rhimes  and some other of their excellencies Perhaps it wou'd have bee  happy too for our Poetry if we had confin'd this  Musick  as you call it to it  proper subjects How wretchedly doe  it sound in some of our Tragedies i  such all the Actors to me seem rathe  to be  playing at Crambo  with one another than endeavouring in the least to affect the Audience With all the violence that Mr  Dryden  wrote in this cause you  ee he was forc'd to recant at last The  only true reason of his persisting in it at  ll is I believe very obvious tho' the  as  he wou'd have given us It was then  he Humour of the Age  Dryden  every  ne knows wrote for Money and his  usiness was to please his Customers  And now I have mentioned Mr  Dryden  may be worth the enquiry to consider  little more particularly what that  riter has said on this subject as he must  allow'd on all hands to have been  e of the nicest Judges of Harmony one  the greatest Masters of Versification  d one of the best Poetical Criticks in  neral that our Nation has ever pro  ced  In reading what he has given us in  fferent places on this head 'tis easy  ee that he very much observes a  erence between  Rhime  in the  genuine  e of the word by which he always  ends the true Harmony of Verse  Rhime  in the  lowest  sense or that  gle and playing with sounds in which  Moderns have exceeded all the other  of the World and which indeed  since the last revival of Letters has bad fair for the  Universal Monarchy  in Poetry  Tho'  Dryden  understood Rhime in the first sense as well as most Writers and yet generally stoop'd to the use of it in the other Nevertheless I am inclined to believe that he always saw thorough the Defects and Inconveniencies not to say the Barbarity and Childishness of it Indeed one might be justified in saying even this for  Dryden  himself follows  Vossius  in calling it expresly  Preface to  V  rgil  's Pastorals p  A Childish sort of verse  and says that some  Rhiming Hexameters  which may be discover'd in  Homer  were probably the remains of a  Barbarous Age  Virgil  add  that writer had them in such abhorrence that he would rather make  false  Syntax  that what we call a RhimeThe nicer Ears in  Augustus  his Cour  cou'd not pardon him for a Line i  which he had only dropt something like it so that the principal Ornament of Modern Poetry was accounted  deformity  by the  Latins  and  Gree  After observing that the  Greek  tongu  falls naturally into  Iambicks  and th  Latin  into  Heroick  verse he calls all o  little arts of Rhiming  Barbarities  An  adds that  As  Age  brings Men back i  to the state and infirmities of  Childhood  upon the  fall  of their Empire the  Romans doted  into  Rhime  What you have now read to me interpos'd  Philypsus  shews sufficiently that Mr  Dryden  cou'd give up an old Friend and abuse him heartily behind his back That writer cou'd speak the severest things of Rhime when he was got into a vein of Prosewriting But the present ill treatment he gives to it may perhaps be on some particular Occasion and in some Cases I cannot deny that Rhime may be a very improper Ornament  No return'd  Antiphaus  he is here speaking of Rhime in general and on a general occasion If you wou'd know his sentiments of Rhime more particularly in relation to the present purpose and its use in translating an  Heroick Po  m  as it happens there is a remarkable  assage wrote by him on this very occasion it was in his more advanc'd Judgment and particularly as he himself informs us when he was in his great Climaterick He is speaking of  Han  al Caro  's Translation of the  Aeneid  The performance  Dedication to his  Aeneid  p  says he is very  mean tho' that Poet took the  advantage  of writing in Blankverse and freed himself from the shackles of Modern Rhime I will not make a digression here proceeds that Writer tho' I am strangely tempted to it but will only say that he who can write  well  in Rhime may write  better  in Blankverse Rhime is certainly a constraint even to the  best  Poets and those who make it with  most ease  What it adds to  Sweetness  it takes away from  sense  and he who loses the  least  by it may be call'd a  Gainer  It often makes us  swerve  from an Author's meaning as if a mark be set up for an Archer at a great distance let him aim as exactly as he can the least Wind will take his Arrow and divert it from the White  Thus far Mr  Dryden  And his opinion weighs the more with me in this case because if any thing we might expect that he shou'd be prejudiced in favour of Rhime but the reason of the thing You see prevailed over all other considerations He goes sofar as to condemn his own manner of Writing rather than suffer such a corruption to pass without a severe Censure and to that end very generously gives up his Practice to his Judgment  Indeed I know of but one argument and that the meerest  Circle  in the World to support the present practise of writing in rhime we must  use  it because 'tis all the  fashion  We who were never so far infected can laugh heartily at some of the  French  for rhiming thoroughout their Comedies yet Rhime in Tragedy was very becoming among us in an Age not the least knowing and polite Disuse has made us see the flatness and inconvenience of that Ornament and nothing reads more insipid than the best Pieces left us in that way Tell me  Philypsus  why do we so much dislike those Beauties of their kind in our Age  I believe says  Philypsus  'tis as you observe Now the taste is alter'd and the sashion worn off we can look back  nd perceive with ease the prejudice of that beauty where the End is to stir up the Soul by true representations of Nature To  raise  La Tragedie roulât sur deux passions  cavoir la terreur que doivent donner les suites  nestes du vice la compassion qu' inspire la  ertu persecutèe patiente Arch  ev de  Cam  ay  Sur l'Eloquence Dial  Terror or Compas  n is the business of the tragick Poet  and  o endeavour to raise either with Rhime  and all its Harmony seems to me more proper for an  Italian  Opera than an  English  Tragedy  Very true says  Antiphaus  and do  ou not judge it as absurd where any other Passions are to be mov'd as well as Terror and CompassionUndoubtedly reply'd  Philypsus  And is it not the business of the Epick to awake the S  ul to raise in it an esteem for Vir  ue and an hatred to Vice in a Word to move the Passions particularly those very Passions you have mention'd Why then is Rhime which you disallow in Trag  dy to be thought useful and com  dable in the EpickAs for mo  ng the Passions says  Philypsus  Rhime I  llow y  u is of no use in either bu  it is a fine Ornament which may b  more proper in the one than in the other In Dramatick Pieces the Persons should be suppos'd to speak extempore but there can be no such thing conceiv'd in an Epick PoemI beg your Pardon says  Antiphaus  Tho' not so strongly  yet this is o  ten suppos'd in an Epick  as well as in Tragedy Do you thin  that  Homer  is telling you a story o  Ul  sses  when we are got into  Phaaci  In the  d Aeneid  have you not sever  intermediate Ideas which agree not wit  a Reader but a SpectatorYes Sir in all active Poems as well as Tragedy The Author is to disappear as much as possible the greatest Art of them is to deceive us into an imagination that we hear the very Persons speaking and see them acting before us  In ipsis Omnia  unt oculis  Every Poem the nearer it comes to this the more perfect it is Consider too how much of any good Epick piece is purely Dramatick 'tis  carce to be imagin'd for Instance how  mall a number of Lines in the  Aeneid  are properly  Virgil  's they almost all belong to the Persons engag'd in the Poem and where the Lines are spoke we see the attitudes and behaviour of the particular Persons and receive the words from their Mouth  Much of what you urge is true answer'd  Philypsus  but yet you must allow that Rhime sounds unnatural in Tragedy and agreeable in pieces of the other kind That is as we were just  aying reply'd  Antiphaus  because in these 'tis at present all the Mode let the fashion alter and this beauty will  ook as false in one as it has already in  he other This  Italian  Taste of your  Tasso  's and  Ariosto  's led away the first Poet of our Nation who attempted any  thing toward an Epick and probably we shou'd to this Day have thought it the only proper for our Language had it not happily been disdain'd by the great Genius of  Milton  who chose rather to follow the true old  Roman  manner It was  Milton  who flung off our Fetters and we may venture to say in the prophetical manner of a very good Poet now living  that  Mr  Watts  's Horae Lyr Pref p  He  shall  for ever be honour'd as our deliverer from that bondage  What a pity it is he did not suffer us still to continue in it since we are so fond of our Chains How happy wou'd it have been to have given up the Nervousness and Majesty of his Poem for  Pryor  's Ease or the Sweetness of  Waller  I know not what they world may say to it but for my part when I read in the Bishop of  Sarum  's History  That  Paradise Lost  is a noble Piece  B  shop  Burnet  's History of his own Times p  b  See the  Spect  tor  V Numb  tho the Author affected to write it in blank verse  it always puts me in mind of the Gentleman in the monkish Ages of Poetry who said of  Virgil's  Aeneid that  it wa  really a very good Poem and wanted nothing but the c Sweets of Rhime to mak  it the most perfect Work in its kind  Well says  Philypsus  I own there is the greater majesty in Blank verse but you will own too that the other is the more beautiful Yes reply'd  Antiphaus  but for that very reason is Blankverse undoubtedly the more proper for the  Epick  as that is the most majestick kind of Poetry imaginable And even as to the Sound Those musical returns if allow'd to be true Beauties are more than ballanc'd by the  Dead Manner  introduc'd with them into Poetry What I mean is that  perpetual likeness  in the cadence and turn of the Periods How frequently do they fall in several repeated Couplets without any variety or relief to the Ear You will sometimes meet with a RhimePoem all the Lines of which run off entirely with the same pauses the stream always equal and so level that you can scarce perceive it to move What do you think of each Couplet chiming on in the same stops and measure with the most tedious uniformity of sound imaginableThat is the fault of the Poet not of the use of Rhime says  Philypsus  I could name you  Poem of this kind which has almost  s great a variety in the Periods as any Piece in Blankverse Possibly you mean  a piece with Mr  Oldisworth  's Name to it says  Antiphaus  which I have heard you commend particularly on that score 'Tis true our Poets of late have endeavour'd to diversify the sound as much as possible We see great improvements of this kind in the excellent Translator of  Vida  's  Poeticks  and several in the most nervous and vigorous of all our Translators both in his  Manilius  and  Lucretius  Mr  Pope  seems to have thought of this much more frequently in his  Odyssey  than in the former Translation of the  Iliad  and gives us an admirable  Od B Observ  Observation upon it toward the conclusion of his last work But after all let our Poets manage the cadence and structure in Rhimeverse never so artfully it will fall vastly short of Blank in these particulars Indeed Rhime is a natural Enemy to them it breaks and disturbs both the structure and the cadence The very sound of any periods the best contriv'd will convince one o  this when a person of a good Ear is reading them you may observe that he endeavours to drop the Rhime and lose the gingle of it as much as possible and  when the sound of it is not sufficiently kept under you will find that it spoils the continuance and occasions too great a break in the period  You may see by what I have been saying that this charge is not design'd against  single Couplets  The corruption in this respect evidently ceases where there are no periods to be varied To determine precisely where it will grow prejudicial wou'd be difficult and is not very material Tho' I know not but what it might be uneasy to a very nice Ear to have only four Lines together with regular Rhime and possibly on this very account the Stanza but of two Couplets has generally unequal Rhimes the Second Line answering the Fourth and that of Three varies in the last Couplet However forc'd or delicate this observation may be thought one thing I cou'd assert with some degree of Confidence I dare say any one of a good Ear who reads only ten Lines of the best RhimeVersification and an equal number of  Milton  's true harmonious Verses upon this view will find a nobler sound and that variety which is necessary to the beauty of periods and to the pleasure of a Reader much stronger and much  uller in the latter  What has been said of  Couplets  may in a great Measure be said of  Odes  which consist of proper  Stanzas  As these come next to Couplets for shortness they have scarce room singly for the tedious Uniformity we have been complaining of and unless the  Ode  be long they do not produce it by their  Number  There may be a variety too of singular use in this sort of Poetry where a person can run these  Stanzas  artfully into one another if the interweaving of them be not so frequen  and equal as to bring in that very Satiety we wou'd avoid Thus qualified Rhime is at least very tolerable in  Odes  And even in  Pindaricks  the most extensive and lofty of any the prejudice of it is not so pressing There is so great a Liberty I mean in our modern  Pindaricks  of varying the Numbers and of fixing or deferring the Rhime at pleasure But above all in single Couplets Rhime is most allowable and in them indeed I should think it deserves the preference to Blankverse it may please the Ear more and cannot do that mischief for which it is chiefly to be avoided in all large Pieces and all compositions of a nobler sort In this respect i  is with Poetry as it is in Building A Pile compos'd of Stones cut just alike  all equal and uniform and disposed alike without any thing either great or beautiful in the whole will yield to one of a good design form'd of materials various and unequal and perhaps ruder or less exactly polish'd At the same  ime the particulars of which it is made  aken singly will evidently exceed the  thers Thus we find in a walk of Trees  hat the two Opposites when cut to  nswer each other look better than if  hey were in disagreeing Figures but a Wood or a Garden full of Trees all  one Figure wou'd be rather displea  ng to the Eye than otherwise In the  o similar Figures we should have a  easing  Uniformity  but in this large  peated view of the same thing we  ou'd lose that  Variety  which a late  ry ingenious Writer has shewn to be  eparable from the Idea of Beauty and  hich the mind seems to require the  re as the number of Objects is en  eas'd  It is a known Rule in versification  t the Second Rhime ought not to re  ble the sound of those in a preceding  uplet When it is carried to the far  st it will not bear beyond the Third  e and even that is run generally in  an  Alexandrine  that in some degree  the turn of the Period and the Numbers may be varied Now why shou'd it not be as disagreeable to have a perpetual uniformity of Periods as a continued likeness of Rhime The latter no Man in the World will allow to be proper nay it cou'd not be born with only for three Couplets together  But supposing Rhime a real beauty in Poems of an higher kind which I am perswaded it is not to speak nothing of its uniform returns and the havock which it makes in the Periods nor even of the  diversion  it gives the thoughts of the  Reader  and its general disservice to pieces that shou'd be solid and pathetick to omit all this the single reason which introduc'd this question is as I take it sufficient to determine it If Rhime is exceedingly apt to mislead a  Writer  often to cramp and sometimes to spoil his sentiments its benefits as being only benefits of Sound will be far from ballancing those inconveniences of so much superiour a nature This at least is the Case with Rhime it gives either an impertinent pleasure or an unnecessary trouble to a writer and at the same time that it distracts his attention  it encreases his difficulties in a word  'tis a false bent put upon the thoughts  of the Poet and in the best proves frequently a counterbiass too strong for their good Sense  I own it is with a strange readiness that people fall generally into this taste it has almost  universal consent  on its side and the few Asserters of the Liberty of Verse meet with little Praise or even Countenance from the World How many Persons would fly into unreasonable Heats upon hearing half that I have said to you I should beg the favour of any such Person who wou'd please to be disobliged in it to ask himself what argument there is for this practise which has so generally obtain'd in the modern World If he can find none 'tis easy to bring the matter more home and to ask farther whether he thinks Rhime wou'd be proper in the  Odyssey  or  Aeneid  and then what single reason can be assigned why it should be improper in a  Latin  or  Greek  and not so in an  English Epick  Yes  Philypsus  I am perswaded it is nothing but use which makes it supportable at present and whenever the world recovers it self from this  agreeable Stupor  it will then appear as ridiculous to the Reader as it has been inconvenient to the Poet This I really imagine that in fu  ure and perhaps far distant Ages the  Criticks when they look back on any the best Poem of this sort which may be deliver'd down to them from their Ancestors will be at a loss to give any account of their Manner of Writing When they read Mr  Pope  's  Iliad  or  Odyssey  they will often applaud the greatness of his thoughts and often admire the happiness of his diction as far as the present Language shall be preserv'd to them They will honour his remains and when they look toward his Ashes with veneration  There will they say lies the Great Man who in ancient Days is said to have shewn the noblest Genius to Poetry in the World what beauties do we discover in him thro' all this rust of time and so much obsolete language He is every way to be commended as far as any of our ancient Poets are Only he fell into the common fault of those Ages and always shews that trifling labour of making the last syllable of every alternate line sound like the close of th  foregoing Bating this insignifican  tas  e of those times how much is he to be praised and how much to be admired  It wou'd have been much better and much more for their honour for Mr  Dryden  in his time or Mr  Pope  in ours to have broke thorough this tedious Slavery and to have  reed the World from a taste so irrational and barbarousI own it to you I have something of an Impatience in me to see this great Reformation in Poetry set on foot I wish it cou'd be brought about in our Time and if not almost envy those who in future Ages shall be so happy as to see Men awake from this Lethargy of Verse when all the Poets shall conspire to restore strength to their Sentiments and nerves and variety to their Numbers when the Writers shall throw aside all those idle Arts and Tricks which we now play with Sounds and  true Harmony  shall flourish without incroaching upon  true Sense  Conclusion of the  Earl  of  Roscommon  's Essay  Translated Ve  se  O might I live to hail the glorious day  And sing loud  Pae  s  thro' the crowded way  When in triumphant state the  B  itish  Muse  True to herself shall  barbarous  aid refuse  And in the  Roman  Majesty appear  Which none know better and none come so near  Philypsus  began to be moved by what his friend had urg'd on this head I confess says he You are a powerful adversary to Rhime but you must allow one some time to get a thorough dislike of a thing which has once been so agreeable There are some allowances too to be made in the present case I believe no man is less embarass'd by the use of Rhime than Mr  Pope  and his command in Writing will take off much of your objection at present tho' I own y  ur reasoning against this Fashion in general to be very strong and forcible However this Writer has a peculia  happiness in it and his Language flows with the greatest ease in the World I believe you can scarce instance a verse in the whole Work which does not ru  off smooth and handsomely 'Tis tru  says  Antiphaus  there are very few in i  that are harsh or any way faulty eithe  in Sound or Composition two or thre  which I remember of that kind are scar  worth repeatingYes interrupted  P  lypsus  if you have observ'd any such

sound or posture of the words but I only mention them it wou'd be frivolous to make particular remarks on them You may see  Philypsus  that my stock is quite out when I sink so low my task this Evening was difficult enough to me and indeed 'tis not easy for any one to find many faults in a Piece which comes from such excellent hands Have you nothing farther to observe on it says  Philypsus  I think I have heard you speak formerly of some ContradictionsThat particular I had forgot lays  Antiphaus  there are indeed some  seeming Contrarieties  in this work these are of two sorts one in which the  Translator is  contrary  to his Original and the other when the Translation seems to have some little Circumstances in it contradictory to one another  Since you mention the thing I believe I can recollect a passage or two in which the sense is press'd so far or so much altered from what it was that they seem directly opposite to the Original When the  Grecian  Commanders were drawn into  Troy  in the famous Wooden Horse the Enemy upon suspicion of the design us'd an artifice to make them  cry out  by surprize if there were really any persons conceal'd in it  Homer  tells us that all of them  sat very silent  only  Anticlus  one of the Officers was just  ready  to answer when  Ulysse    who sat by him  stopt his mouth by force  prevented his making any noise and s  preserv'd all their Lives Instead o  which the Translation says that thi  Anticlus  B δ'  Unable to controul  Spoke loud  the languish of his yerning soul  In another place where in  Homer  w hear of an Hero falling in the defence o  his Country  under the Walls of his native City  Mr  Pope  in drawing out the Circumstances of it speaks as if it was  B θ'    on a foreign shore  In the Second Book we meet with three or four particulars of this kindThere  Telemachus  desires the suitors as it is in  Homer  to leave him and be quiet as in Mr  Pope  to  B β'    rise in his aid  There the same Prince is said to  draw his hand  gently  out of that of Antinous  instead of which the Translation I think tells us that he  frown'd  caught away his hand  B β'    sternly  and  strode away  in a passion 'Tis the same Case with  Mentor  in the Council he rose to make a speech to them with as the  Greek  signifies a  wise  or  friendly  air but in the  English  B β'  Stern  as he rose he cast his Eyes around  That  flash'd with rage  and as he spoke he  frown'd  These look like contrarieties between  Homer  and his Translator there seem to be a few others between passages in the Translation it self  There is a part of  Mercury  's speech in the  Fifth Odyssey  and another point in the description of  Lachaea  an uninhabited Island which I remember I mention'd to you formerly as Examples of this Inconsistency Such indeed they appear'd to me even after a second and third Reading but upon consulting the Original I at last found them to be capable of a consistent Meaning However it is to be wish'd that the Translator had set them in a clearer light for in one the reader will be apt to imagine that the Poet speaks of  Book Compare Verse with  Inhabitants in a desart Country  and in the other that  Mercury  is said to have been  Book Compare Verse with  vastly delighted  with the sight of  Calypso  's Island and  not t  have been delighted at all  with the sight of it  In another place I take it to be in the very first Book of the  Odyssey Telemachus  says that his Father is  B and  Dead  and that he is  wandering  from Country to Country at the same article of time Thus too we hear the Sea call'd  the  B  foaming Flood  in one Line and in the very next 'tis the  Level surface of the deep  As for  meer Mistakes  where a Verse carries something of  Blunder  in the sound of it I have taken but little notice of them and shall only mention two or three just to shew that the  greatest Writers  are capable of falling into such Errors as will be discernible to the  meanest Readers  B  I answer'd  Goddess human  is thy breast  is a Line of this kind and the Expressions in it will appear to every one that looks upon it to be improperly put together on the same account as those in the following Couplet  B  Some other motive  Goddes    sways thy mind  Some close design or turn of  Womankind  There is a Verse just come into my head in which Mr  Pope  may be thought to talk of  B  See  from their thrones thy kindred Monarchs  sigh  seeing a Sound  and in another we are told of  a place so  Nor the fleet arrow from the twanging bow Sent with full force cou'd reach the depth below B  deep that you cou'd not shoot to the bottom of it  I know not whether a severe Critick would not think that there is a jar between the Expressions where  Ulysses  is said to be  Doom'd to mourn  B  Bitter  Constraint erroneous  and forlorn  And where  Halitherses  speaks of  B  Deeds then undone  but these and such like trifles I shall leave to those who are fond of finding faults and whom I can own without envy to have a greater Niceness and Curiosity in Verbal Criticism than ever I desire to have  These tho' less considerable blemishes in a  poetical  Character are much more obvious to every Eye than the greater defects of a Poem and will be always observ'd upon with more scorn and contempt than any other they border on  Ridicule  and that is a thing which will ever be agreeable to  little  Minds That Verse of Sir  Richard Blackmore  's in which he describes  A painted Vest Prince  Voltigern  had on  Which from a Naked Pict his Gransire won  the  Vest  of a  naked Pict  and that in one of Mr  Dryden  's Tragedies which speaks of  What horrid silence does invade my Ear  Silence invading the Ear  has probably been repeated many times more than the best Line he ever wrote This is low enough  o' conscience tho' it has been a very fashionable way of Criticising of late Years it shews how illnatur'd the World is but people will have their Laugh and 'tis vastly easier to  Ridicule  than to  Admire  It is this sort of Men  Philypsus  and a clan of others equally malicious and more gloomy than the former who have brought the name of  Critick  into such contempt among us While those have imagined that Sneering and Malice are the best titles to Wit and these were of opinion That  to find fault is to Criti  ise  How different from this was the  ethod of the Antient Criticks of  Greece  nd  Rome  Indeed Criticism as first in  tuted by  Aristotle  was design'd for a  andard of judging well to give an in  ght into the Excellencies of Authors  nd to discern their Faults There was  time when it was a study highly ra  onal far from borrowing its force from  idicule and False Wit it shou'd pro  ed upon known Rules and establish'd  easures I do not say but what the  st Criticks may have approved of par  ular Lines without being capable of  gning the Reasons why they pleas'd  m so greatly You often see a Face  ch is very taking without any regularity  of Features such an one as pleases every body tho' no body can give the Reason of his being pleas'd with it Eloquence has its  Je ne scai quoi's  as well as Beauty However most commonly we can specify the particular  features  which are so agreeable or know that our pleasure is founded on the Symmetry of the  whole  But it is not enough that Criticism is rational it shou'd ever be Human and Goodnatur'd Where the Design is great the Disposition just the Descriptions lively and the Language generally good and poetical that work is in general to be commended tho' the Poet in particular Points may have fallen into many faults nay into some which look very gross when they are consider'd singly The greatest Critick among th  Roman  Poets lays it down for a Rule That  where there are  more  Beauties tha  Faults in a Poem that Piece is to be pronounced good  And one of the greate  Criticks among the  Greek  carries it farther He shews at large  Longinus  c  That  ther  is often a  negligence  that is  becomingThat  a greatness of Soul will carry  Man above the observation of little CircumstancesAnd  That  a Poet of a generous Spirit with faults is greatly preferable to a low wary Writer without them  Agreeable to this was the behaviour of these great Men in laying down rules or making observations their intention was to distinguish the beauties of Language or Sentiments from the defects and vices of either You find them to have been in Love with the Charms of Eloquence and the true Spirit of Poetry wherever they meet with them They  ake not that snarling Satisfaction in finding faults which many of their pretended Successors are so full of in their writings Indeed they very freely pointed out the mistakes and vices of the greatest Writers but their chief design in this was that such of their remarks might  erve as  Buoys  to shew where former  entures had miscarried and to prevent  thers from running upon the same Shalows This was the Spirit of the Anti  nt Criticks Their Fate was according  their Merit they still remain among  s and are read with pleasure and ap  ause whilst  Zoilus  the only  Modern  itick of the Antients  has left nothing  behind him except the odious memor  of his Impotence and his Malice  Our modern  Zoilus  's interpos'd  Philypsus  are very easily known They ru  down the performances of the best writers with heat and noise every thing is a fault with them They will go regularly thorough a Poem with a constant frown upon them and think themselves obliged to find mistakes or nonsens  in every Line of it they condemn b  Tale and censure by the Sheet Nothing is more probable than that from th  Poem  they come to quarrel with th  Person  of the Author Blemishes in his moral Character and even natural Imperfections have a share in their observations and in a word they labou  hard to convince you that they are bad Christians as well as bad Criticks The best of it is their attacks are as weak  as they are violent they have but little of Courage tho' they make so great a Noise with it and are like a sort o  Currs that bark most and run the soonest The Character that was given o  the  French  as  Warriors  is true of these People as  Writers  They behave themselves fiercer than Men in the onset  and in the shock are feebler than Women  I think you cannot be too severe upon them resum'd  Antiphaus  they are a Contradiction to true Criticism as they always shew the greatest malice against every thing that deserves the most to be commended Mr  Pope  has had the fate to be attack'd by these Animals and indeed I do not see how he could avoid it He has too many excellencies to let them sleep in quiet  'Tis certain that the faults of a Writer and never was any Writer without faults ought to be observed and the more excellent an Author is the more necessary is such a Work But this is the Drudgery of Criticism the Pleasure and the Profit are on the other side  We ought to shew faults but we ought  ever to shew malice And beside the  eneral good Nature which is owing to  se Great Men who have eminently  blig'd the World by their Labours  here are particular allowances to be  ade in this last work of the greatest  oet of our Age Nothing in the World  s more laborious than Translation  d especially when the Piece is engag'd  r and must go on 'Tis extremely  fficult to keep up the Spirit of Poetry  another's Compositions tho' you catch  all the  Mollia tempora fandi  aptest Moments  and neve  employ the Mind but when there is a  Impetus  comes upon it toward that particular business and this Difficulty i  greatly encreas'd where a Man canno  well set down to it only at such time as his Muse is in a good Humour bu may be obliged in a manner to Writ  by the Hour and upon fixt returns know not how  ar this was the Case wit  Mr  Pope  in this performance b  wherever it was the Poet will be litt  more than a common Man He is a such times much the same as a Proph  without his  Afflatus  Beside this I must repeat what I ha  sa  d s  often The constant returns  Rhim  unavoidably unnerve a P  em The Age is in Love with this Weakne  and Mr  Pope  in indulging their humo  has taken much from the strength of h Genius had he been less obliging to t  taste of his Readers his performan  might have been more sinewy and mo  compleat This ought certainly to  taken into the account and wherev  the Translation falls short of the for  and nervousness of  Homer  we ought co  stant  to ask our selves this question Whether  Homer  himself cou'd have carried it farther had he wrote as Mr  Pope  does in  English  and in  Rhime  'Tis true all this may be said of his Translation of the  Iliad  but if that Piece exceed this of the  Odyssey  it is very natural upon other Accounts that it shou'd do so  Homer  exceeds himself in that PoemGreat Actions strike the Soul with rapidity while all the things that relate to lower Life are less vigo  ous and affectingThe description of Warriors and moral Precepts have a very different effect on the writers them  elves those assist the Poetical flame while these  ling the Mind into a more  edentary Posture 'Tis natural almost  or People to sleep at Sermons But a  attle rouzes and animates the Specta  ors as well as those who are engaged  it Thus there must be less spirit in  he Writer as well as less attentiveness  n the Reader of the  Odyssey  and a Tran  ation of it even from one and the same  and cou'd not fairly be expected to  qual a Translation of the  Iliad  The Rea  r and the Poet have both of them the dis  dvantage of a cooler and more unactive  bject A  Poet  as Age always is vastly  kative A  Fable  laid infinitely lower  and a  Diction  almost perpetual in moral Sentences and Reflections give a pattern very different from  Homer  in all his vigour describing the Passion of  Achilles  and sounding out the Wars of the  Greeks  with an air the most martial and animated that can be imagined  Here  Antiphaus  rose up from his seat and as  Philypsus  perceiv'd that he had finish'd "I was unwilling to interrupt you says he otherwise I shou'd have observ'd on a verse or two which you repeated as rough and of a bad turn What were those Lines of  the Roc  s  which you mention'd just nowOf the Rocks says  Antiphaus  let me seeOh I remember them  No Bird of air no Dove of swiftest wing  Shuns the dire rocks in vain she cuts the skies  The dire rocks meet and crush her as she  lies  The same says  Philypsus  these and that other verse  Rich Tapestry s  iff with inwoven gold  ound indeed rough but to me their roughness is their beauty the turn o  them seems design'd and their manner to be expressive of their sense If that be the Case I beg pardon says  Antiphaus  Were I the greatest enemy in the World  to meer harmony and the stated returns and gingle of syllables I shou'd be one of the first among the admirers of  Sound  whenever it is made serviceable to nature and true sense That is the Art says  Philypsus  and the Mastery for which I particularly admire Mr  Pope  It is he who took up that great Rule of  the Sounds being a comment on the Sense  and enfor  'd it beyond any of the Criticks who went before him To this Writer we chiefly owe the revival of the nobler art of Numbers and the method of signifying motions and actions and all that vast variety of our own passions by  Sounds  In his incomparable  Essay on Criticism  this Writer has given us the best Advises and interwove the most beautiful Examples into them in a manner that will always be admired The first  Stanza  in his  Ode  on St  Caecilia  's Day is the fullest Piece of this kind perhaps extant in any Language 'tis it self a perfect Consort In the Translations of  Homer  we find him very frequent and very just in the same manner of Expressing things I call it so and cou'd almost be perswaded to think it a better way of Expressing than in the common way of  Words  These have a Sense affixt to them by Custom while the other speaks by the Ideas of things  That is a flowing variable help this is the Voice of Nature and a sort of  Universal  Poetical  Language  Mr  Pope  affords us infinite Examples of this Beauty in his Translation of the  Odyssey  it wou'd be endless to repeat them all or to admire them as they deserve But amidst all this variety there is a single Point which I have observ'd more than any of the rest Whenever the Poet is speaking of the watry Element or any thing belonging to it his management of Sounds is particularly frequent and beautiful  Tho' it might not be much observ'd at the first view I know no place where a greater variety of things are express'd this way than in the Twelfth  Odyssey  'Tis where  Ulysses  is giving an account of his setting sail from the Island of  Circe  B  We rush'd into the Main  Then bending to the stroke their oars they drew  To their broad breasts and swift the galley flew  Up sprung a brisker breeze with freshning gales  The friendly Goddess stretch'd the swelling  ails  We drop our oars at ease the pilot guides  The vessel light along the level glides  Then rising sad and slow with pensive look  Thus to the melancholly train I spoke  The objects shift perpetually in these Lines and yet there is not a single period or pause in them the sound and turn of which does not agree perfectly with the sentiment I do not intend to enlarge much upon them but had it been wrote in the Days of  Dionysius Halicarnassaeus  I doubt not but he wou'd have given us a Dissertation on a passage which so variously expresses that Art of which he was particularly fond That is the Critick I think says  Antiphaus  who first  p Ed  R Steph  observ'd this Beauty in the noted Description of  Sisyphus  his Stone Yes answer'd  Philypsus  and every one knows how perfectly well the excellence of that Passage is preserv'd  B λ'  in Mr  Pope  's Translation  Words give us the bare Ideas of things but words thus managed impress them  ery strongly and sensibly upon the mind Do you not perceive the Storm rising  B  W  en the wild Winds whistle o'er the main  and are you not in the midst of it when  B  East West together roar and South and North roll mountains to the Shore  Then are we hurried o'er the Deep and see all the  rocks  and dangers of it  B    Dire  S  ylla  there a scene of Horror forms  And here  Charybdis  fills the sea with storms  When the tide rushes from her rumbling caves  The rough rock roars tumultuous boil the waves  They toss they foam  The next moment if the Poet pleases like the  Daemon  he speaks of He can make all as gentle and serene as it was before rough and boistrous  B  Sunk are at once the winds  the air above  And waves below at once forget to move  Some  Daemon  calm'd the air and smooth'd the deep  Hush'd the loud winds and charm'd the waves to sleep  Did you ever see a more perfect Calm Yet smooth and hush'd as these Lines are you may easily perceive a difference between the description of a still Sea and the easy beautiful current of a River  B  Smooth flows the gentle stream with wanton pride  And in soft mazes rolls a silver tide  How happy is the hand of the Poet and what a Command has he of Nature to make the numbers of his verse  speak his Sentiments Thus to paint even sounds and to draw by Measures what does not come under the power of the Pencil In this Writer Sir  John Denham  's Wish is effected His Lines always flow as his Subjec    Tho' deep yet clear tho' gentle yet not dull  Strong without rage without o'erflowing full  I thank you says  Antiphaus  bowing I thank you my dear  Philypsus  for this unexpected view of one of the greatest Beauties in Poetry I cou'd willingly  ay to hear you farther on this Head  nd am perfectly angry with the Night  or wearing away so fast I hope we  all soon find an opportunity of resu  ing the Subject answer'd  Philypsus  I  eed not tell you how agreeable it is to  e even to be convinc'd of my Errors  Antiphaus  and I'm satisfy'd that  take a delight in any occasion of  miring Mr  Pope  I beg you would  me  Antiphaus  do you not approve  him in some points more than you  e formerly I do not know how it  ays  Antiphaus  but I seem to be both  re pleas'd and more displeas'd with  than I was before this enquiry  Excellencies from the light in which  have set them strike me more agreeably  than ever but then this looking so closely into his Defects has made those too the more gross and visible However concluded  Philypsus  you will still acknowledge with me  That his faults are the faults of a Man bu  his beauties are the beauties of an Angel  You don't seem to like the word it may sound perhaps too high but I mean only of a  Great and Uncommon Genius  FINIS  AN ESSAY ON Pope  's ODYSSEY

ESSAY c  EVENING the FOURTH  _AFTER having engag'd themselves so far we may imagine that  Antiphaus  and  Philypsus  waited with a good deal of Impatience for the remaining Part of  e  Odyssey  As it happen'd they were  oth in Town before it appear'd in Pub  ck and  Philypsus  who was the warmer  the two us'd to enquire almost every  y at  Lintot  's how the Press went on  e grew still the more eager as the  me drew nearer and the first moment  cou'd procure it  in Sheets  he set down  them with all the Pleasure and all the  verity that  Antiphaus  had preach'd up to  m in their former Enquiries  In the time that was taken up by this agreeable Search he call'd often upon that Friend with whom he shar'd his Studies as well as his Affections This was rather a Dividing than Leaving his Pursuits for he scarce ever saw  Antiphaus  without mentioning something of the  Odyssey  and hearing his Sentiments in return When he had gone entirely thorough the Poem he went immediately to desire a Meeting in some place where they might talk more at large upon that Head By good luck  Antiphaus  was perfectly disengag'd  'Tis a fine Evening says he and if you please we will take a turn together in the Gardens of  Horatio  since we cannot enjoy his Company at least let us make use of that Liberty he has left with us There we shall be retir'd from the Noise and Bustle of the Town and safe from every sort of Interruption  Philypsus  was extremely pleas'd to find him so ready they stept together into his Coach which drove immediately to  Horatio  's and set them down at the Gates which lead into the GreatWalk of the Garden  After a turn or two there they sat down by the side of a Fountain full in  ight of the  Thames  which passes at  the bottom of the Walk The Walk itself makes a fine Visto in its Descent to the River at a distance you see the Fields and Hills at first in an easy Ascent varied into Pasture and Arable and then rising unequally and cover'd here and there with Woods till they are insensibly lost in a bluish Cast of the Clouds The agreeableness of the Place made  Philypsus  forget himself for a few Moments he was taken up wholly in wandering with his Eye sometimes over those beautiful Gardens and sometimes over the irregular Prospect that lay before them At last recollecting himself and turning to  An  i  aus  There is a difference says he in the agreeable Sense I  eel at present  rom the delightful Views on all sides of us which may partly confirm what we were talking of just before we sat down  Does not this Masterpiece of Art with all its Symmetry and Justness of Proportions strike the Mind in a fee  ler manner than that Landskape of Nature in its infinite Irregularity These measured Rises and Falls in Slopes answering each other Those Groves terminating every way in an exactness of  igure These Walks intercrossing with  ut confusion and uniting  o happily  cannot fail of pleasing the Eye very much Yet that Wildness and Variety abroad the River Lawn Fields and Woods so beautifully interspers'd compose a Scene much finer and more engaging For my part I shou'd be apt to prefer that single Grot yonder and the hanging Precipice over it to a whole Scenary of natural Objects laid out in the most regular order imaginable There is something of this in the Pleasure which is given us by the greatest Writers A Noble natural Genius however irregular and unconfin'd delights us in a much higher degree than the most uniform and correct And the Writer who enjoys this freedom of Soul amidst all his Starts and Errors is greatly to be prefer'd to the Justness of one who is too severe to commit a Fault and too cool and phlegmatick to be a P  et  Such a temper reply'd  Antiphaus  can never produce any thing truly Great The noblest Poet in the World has not the fewest Faults and the same Spirit which qualified  Homer  to be so is what at the same time might hurry him away from a nicer Observation of some little Particulars The very Negligencies of  Homer  shew the Greatness of his Spirit and where there may be any like Negligencies  in the Version of  Homer  methinks it wou'd be but Justice to attribute them to the same Cause at least where the Spirit of that Poet is so discernible as it is in this late Translation  I cannot but smile sometimes when I hear a severer Reader very gravely condemning a Poem for a few Faults which may be evident in it here and there Nothing can be plainer than that our Judgments ought to be form'd upon the Whole and not upon Particulars the Superiority of Beauties or D  fects is the only thing that can determine the Character of the Piece 'Tis possible that Mr  Hobbes  may have express'd a word or two correctly where the New Translation has deviated into a Metaphorical or licentious Expression but what a strange method of Comparison would it be to settle our opinion of the Writers from hence By such a way of proceeding we might prefer one who loses the Life and Vigour of Poetry throughout to others who preserve it so strongly in the general Turn of their Compositions  As we go on  Philypsus  with our usual freedom of speaking our Sentiments on each particular Passage I dare say  that even all those which may seem faulty to us will make but a small figure when compar'd to the several Excellencies of this Piece As for my part after a Research of some care thro' the whole Translation I find no reason at all to alter my Opinion  That the Beauties of it are far more numerous and far more considerable than its Blemishes even taking all those things for  real  Blemishes which we may only  imagine  to be such  If the fashionable Choice of  Verse  be justly blameable it may as justly be said that no one moves with more freedom in his Fetters In particular Lines there may be some farther disagreeable  Likenesses  of Sound but the  Variety  of Numbers in general is great and handsome What Smoothness and Harmony do we find thro' the course of the Poem and how seldom are they interrupted either by the  Littleness  or the  Vastness  of the Words by the  Openness  of the Vowels the  Clashing  of Consonants or any other Roughnesses whatever Not to mention against these that  Significance  of Sound which is more frequent and more happily practis'd by Mr  Pope  in particular than by any other of the Modern Poets  As to the  Diction  not only the Poem but our Language itself is enrich'd by it Where it is once Mean it is in many instances Great Noble and Solemn Where a Simplicity beyond our Taste is to be preserv'd we may expect some Flatnesses And it may be to these perhaps we owe that Justness and Purity which in so many places makes us imagine that we are conversing with Persons of those First Ages of the World in all their Plainness and Honesty of Behaviour At other times the Narration is rais'd and the Images strengthen'd by a figurative way of speaking tho' no doubt in some cases to excess but these Excesses may well be pass'd over when we consider that they proceed from Liberties which are highly useful in rendering the Stile the more various and poetical so far as frequently to improve upon  Homer  himself  Above all is that  flame  and  spirit  diffus'd thro' the whole Poem and oftentimes so well kept up as to make us forget that we are reading a Translation When we are engag'd in the Piece do not the  great  and  generous  Sentiments we meet with perpetually make a few Thoughts which have something  cold  or  little  in them appear inconsiderable  upon the first Comparison What  Eclaircisements  have we and how little  Obscurity  What a number of natural Thoughts Images and Descriptions might be produc'd to overballance such Lines in it as may seem to be Affected or too Artificial  Thus which ever way we turn ourselves whether we consider the  Poetical Spirit  the  Language  or the  Versification  in each of them the Beauties far exceed the Defects It is with this Notion we ought to proceed in our Enquiries we must carry this Thought all along with us Let us remember  Philypsus  That all human Excellence stands merely on Comparison that no one is without Faults and that very few arrive in any tolerable degree towards Perfection That Mr  Pope  does not only appear among the Few but that his Superiority is every way visible If we compare his Compositions in general with those of our other Poets the Disproportion is as great as when we compare the Blemishes of his own Poetry with the Beauties which every where abound in it  Some of these we are now to consider and we may enter on this View with the greater Pleasure as we have the advantage  of Mr  Pope's  own Observations in several Points both as to those things in which he met with the greatest difficulty and the Methods he has taken of raising his Language and improving the Versification  One of the greatest Sources of raising as well as enlarging the Poetical Language is by inventing New Words or importing old Ones from a foreign Soil Words when they are us'd vulgarly grow mean Like other Fashions when their use is once got among the Populace they soon begin to be rejected by the politer Part of the World This it is as  Art de bien Parler  Part Chap Sect  the  Gentlemen  of  Port Royal  very justly observe which necessitates the introducing of New Words into every Language it occasions a continual Decay and demands continual Supplies Thus whoever has a Felicity this way is a Benefactor to the Publick he adds so much to the Bank and gives his Assistance in supporting the present Credit of Language among us  It wou'd be equally trifling and laborious to give all the particular Instances of this Version's enriching our Language It is every where visible there  is no reading a Book in the  Odyssey  without observing it frequently You will almost constantly find his new Words to be apt easy and poetical Sometimes he introduces the Expressions and even the  Peculiarities  of other Languages into our own These when unforc'd please us very particularly by the Variety and Novelty they bring along with them We admire the Stranger in our Habit and are extremely taken to see him look as free and easy as if he were a Native and had been always truly English  The Poet has the same Art and Delicacy in  Connecting  two Words into one a thing much more difficult than  Inventing  The Union is proper and insensible there is no Knot where they are ingrafted in short they  Thus  Mellif  uous attemper'd evershady illperswading serpentmazes  and several others in this Translation  may be said rather to grow into one another than to be brought together by Art I do not say that this hits so naturally in all the Instances there may be  Thus perhaps  Seagirt endlong loved  ttied womanstate  c in the same  some Words less tractable or less harmonious than others But in  general we may affirm that as his Translation is wrought off from a Language which in this Respect greatly exceeds all that ever were So the Imitations of it this way are unusually Beautiful and Harmonious  To deviate from the strict Rules which Grammarians wou'd impose on Words either single or as they stand in their relations to one another gives an agreeable uncommon Air to Language but in the very Notion of it carries something of difficulty and niceness along with it Mr  Pope  seems to have thought it the safest way in such Cases to follow or resemble those Deviations which have been already Authoriz'd by some Masterly hand and where he strikes more boldly into any new Freedom he is generally careful of giving things such an Openness that they may neither perplex the Sense nor embarrass the Period  A thing more useful and agreeable than either of these is to turn the stream of Words out of their common ChannelThere is a good deal of Stiffness which yet attends our Language from the stated order of Words in such a repeated Succession and tho' we are much freer than our Neighbours the  French  in this particular I shou'd be glad to  see our Poets at least go yet farther towards the Liberties of the old  Greeks  and  Romans  Mr  Pope  has some strokes toward this he is sometimes bold in varying the expected range of Words to give his Sentences a new and agreeable air he transposes their order often by his own Judgment and often in imitation of some of our best Poets who have succeeded in it before  I wou'd not have a certain Grammarian or two overhear me commending these Liberties so freely it wou'd certainly cost one a Dispute You know the Men they are as strict in the Punctilio's of Words as some formal People are in the little Points of Behaviour I warrant you your Neighbour The Doctor wou'd stand as strictly upon the  Nominative Case's going before the Verb  as  Wicquefort  wou'd for the Precedence of an Embassador 'Tis certain he can settle all the Rules of Place from undeniable Authorities disposes of the Upperhand with perfect Oeconomy and upon the whole would make an Excellent  Master of the Ceremonies  among Words and Syllables  However with this Gentleman's leave there are several just  Liberties  which may be allow'd for varying the Poetical  Plurimae sint locutiones  apud Poetas usita  ssimae  in primis  elegantes  quae scriptis Pro  cis usurpatae etiam Grammaticae leges violant  Trapp  's Prael Poet Page c to Page  Stile and many Aids proper to enliven and elevate it in the more noble Parts of a Poem  Among the latter Mr  Pope  has made very good use of Antiquated Words and no less of Expressions borrow'd from our Translation of the Sacred Writings The Language of Scripture as it is receiv'd from the first with a certain religious Awe will still retain something venerable and august it may therefore be of signal Service in giving to the Heroick Muse that Majesty which so well becomes the Sublime Air she ought to assume 'Tis much the same in the revival of old Words Antiquity always carries a sort of Solemnity with it in its very Roughnesses and Decays The  Rustick  strikes the Mind as strongly as any thing in Architecture and Ruins themselves have often something awful and majestick in them  I wou'd not willingly interrupt you says  Philypsus  but the humour of heaping superannuated Words in some late Poems is too provoking to be pass'd by How have our  Miltonick  Writers in particular  prostituted them on all occasions in what an undistinguishing manner do they labour to draw into their Works any word which their great Master has adopted into his  Paradise LostErst Nathless Behests Welkin  and a Thousand other Expressions of equal beauty and agreeableness of Sound are repeated ten times in every Sheet of theirs in short these Gentlemen have made me quite sick of People's going two Hundred Years backward for their Language and furnishing out half their Poems from the Vocabularies annex'd to  Spencer  and  Chaucer  As for some of those Writers reply'd  Antiphaus  calmly You have reason to be angry with them but if we may reject any thing meerly for the  abuse  of it there is nothing of the greatest  use  that we may not fairly reject  Virgil  made particular use of this method in his Poems and was  Cum sint verba Propria sicta translata Prop  iis dignitatem dat  Antiquitas eo ornamento  Vi  g  l  u  u  ice  st usus Quintil Instit  Lib Cap  Lib C  p  admired by his Countrymen on that account What is your Opinion of our  Milton  Are you displeas'd with the antiquated Words in his Writings No  Philypsus  I know your Taste too  well to imagine any thing of that nature And even of those that have follow'd his Example there is one or two who make good use of them This we see in  Philips  's pieces not to mention the new  WINTER  by Mr  Thompson  Poem we were reading the other Day the Author of which beside several other Beauties is by no means unhappy in his Management of this sort of Words I agree with you the  Abuse  of them is frequent and much to be condemn'd If perpetual they run into a meer Barbarism and indeed whereever they are thrust in without any other reason except their being Ancient they give a Roughness and Disorder instead of the proper Solemnity But when they are plac'd here and there with Judgment they support the greatness of our Ideas and reflect a venerableness on the subject Were the Old Oaks that are left standing in the Gardens of  Blenheim  more numerous that Design might have too much of the Forest in it but as they  re they serve to communicate the nobler  ir of Antiquity to the things about them  nd appear in a Majesty of Years equal  o the Grandeur of the Place  I wou'd desire you to commend the in  rtion of Solemn Words only as they  are proper to the Places in which they are us'd We see by Mr  Pope  's Observations on this Head that he understands the Benefit of them perfectly well as his Works shew that he practises up to his own Rules and scarce ever inserts either the Words of former Centuries or the Language of Scripture but where the Subject demands a solemn and venerable Turn  As these are the chief Methods of  ennobling  the Poetick Stile so the chief to  enliven  it is the free and various use of  Epithets  No one thing is of greater service to the Poets for distinguishing  eir Language from Prose This has occasion'd that  Eo  Epitheto  poetae frequentius liberius u  untur Namque illis satis est conveni  verbo cui apponitur ita  Dentes albi Humi  Vina  in his non reprehenduntur  Quintil Insti  Lib Cap  large and unrestrain'd use of them so much beyond what we  nd in Oratory And tho'  Homer  is more bold and frequent in this than any of the Poets who have wrote since I know not any of the  Ancient  Criticks who have ever blam'd him on that account 'Tis partly from his uncommon liberties this way that Mr  Pope  looks upon his Epithets as one of the  Pref to  Il  p  Distinguishing  Marks  of that Poet In  Homer  they have on several accounts a peculiar air and this Translation not only preserves their proper beauties but shews many Methods of improving upon them Sometimes the Old are set in a stronger light and sometimes New ones added with a peculiar grace Sometimes several are applied to the same thing without  Huge horrid vast  Od      that strictness of connexion which wou'd  Dem Phal    flatten the energy of them and where the poverty of our Language will not convey their full Sense in the Conciseness of the Original they are enlarged upon in the Translation and laid more open to our view  Epithets  Philypsus  like Pictures in Miniature are often entire descriptions in one Word This may be either from their own significance or by their immediate connexion with some known object We see the thing when the Poet only mentions the  Nodding Crest  of an Hero and form a larger Idea of  Jove  from the single Epithet of  Cloudcompelling  than we might find in a description more diffuse It was chiefly from  See Mr  Pope  's Note on  Il    two Poetical Epithets  that  Phidias  design'd the countenance of his  Olympian Jupiter  as in Reverse we often see the Person in his Epithet from our being acquainted with some Statue or Picture to which it refers Thus when  Apollo  is call'd the  ArcherGod  it recalls to our memory the representations we have so often seen of that Deity the compleat Figure is rais'd up in the Mind by touching upon that single circumstance  'Tis by the same means that one single Epithet gives us the Idea of any Object which has been common and familiar to us Meadows Fields Woods Rivers and the Sea itself are often imag'd by one wellchosen word Thus in that  See      beautiful Description of  Calypso  's Bower you see the Groves  of living green  the Alders  ever quivering  the  nodding  Cypress and its high Branches  waving  with the Storm 'Tis by Epithets that the ancient Poets paint their  Elysian Gr  ves  and the Modern their  WindsorForests  Where our Language will not admit of this conciseness we find the Image preserv'd by a Description more full and diffusive thus  The Morning Sun encreasing bright  Od    O'er Heavens pure Azure spreads the growing light  I shou'd think that the Opening of the Sense in a larger Compass may often be approv'd even where we are not driven to it by the poverty of our Language  Homer  himself who has the advantage of single Words so much stronger and more significant often chuses to draw out his Sentiments into several Lines and sometimes  N  which is beautifully express'd by  Horace  in three words  nimi  m lubricus aspici  is enlarged by  Homer  himself on a fit occasion into three lines Compare Ιλ λ with ν'  the very same Sentiment which upon other Occasions he has express'd in one word only May not the same Liberty be allow'd to his Translators Is it not a fine Enlargement for Instance where  Homer  is speaking of  Penelope's Veil  with the Epithet of  Pellucid  only to say that  the Transparent Veil  Od      Her beauty seems and only seems to shade  Tho' these imaging and descriptive Epithets are the more Beautiful those which add Strength and Emphasis are  by no means to be contemn'd This way they are of great Service in all  Satire  and particularly in that Abusiveness which  Homer  is not over nice in bestowing upon his Gods they appear well in the Ridicule of the Suitors and are strong and vehement in any  Arrogant Character  particularly in all Contemners of the Gods I shall give you only one instance of the latter from  Polypheme  's Answer to  Ulysses  Fools that you are the monster made reply  His inward fury blazing at his eye  Or strangers distant far from our abodes  To bid me reverence or regard the Gods  Know that we Cyclops are a race above  Od    Those  airbr  d people  and their  goatnurs'd Jov  You must have observ'd  Philypsus  several other Methods of using Epithets poetically I need not mention the peculiar fitness and strength which they may acquire from the  Od  compared with verse  occasions  on which they are us'd or the  Light  they are set in That  Od    Substantives  are sometimes us'd as  Epithets  and sometimes  Od    Epithets  as  Substantives  Sometimes the  Od    Metaphor  is convey'd this way with a good Grace  and at others two  Thwarting Ideas  are mixt together in a very agreeable manner Mr  Addison  is the first I know of that observ'd upon these and gave them their Name and of this kind is the  Od    Vegetable Venom  in the fourth  Odyssey  which answers  Addison  's  Misc  Vol p  his Instance of  Aurum Frondens  from  Virgil  I know not whether I perfectly apprehend you or not interpos'd  Philypsus  Do You not mean that particular sort of Metaphor when some strange  quality  in a thing is turn'd into an  Epithet  and directly applied to itEither that or else some strange Circumstance applied in the same manner in both 'tis the Novelty and the Surprize that please usI take you says  Philypsus  and believe I now see a farther Reason why a very natural Passage in another Poem by Mr  Pope  has always been so agreeable to me 'Tis where he speaks of the odd Appearance of things from their inversion in a River I think I can repeat it  Oft in the StreamThe musing Shepherd spies  The headlong Mountains and the downward Skies  The wa  ry Landskip of the pendant Woods  And absent trees that tremble in the floods  In the clear azure Gleam the Flocks are seen  WindsorForest  p folio  And floating Forests paint the Waves with green  These are of the kind I mean says  Antiphaus  they are bold but they are natural Indeed with due caution greater Contrarieties than these may be join'd under some particular Circumstance to justify so unexpected an Union Thus all Epithets which contradict the general Sense of the Thing but agree with the particular Occasion Thus is  Grief  call'd  pleasing  there are  Kindnesses  which are  terrible  As when the  Cyclops  in the height of his good nature promis  s  Ulysses  that he shall be the last he will devour  Od    And in many cases  Death  and even  Disgrace  may be  desirable  Instances of this kind are very frequent especially among our modern Poets There are  Od    otherwise  c  many in this Translation in particular 'tis this which gives a new Air to that gay  Verse  Speech of  Mercury  in the Eighth Book  Tho' the  Latins  us'd this agreeable Clash of Ideas  the Greek Poets  as Mr  Addison  M  sc  Vol p  observes on the former Head  wanted Art for it  They at least the more Ancient of them never join things that seem to disagree in so close an Union Unless where Nature her self  has led the way in an  Thus in the  Twilight  when we have really a sort of  visible Darkness Homer  uses an Epithet of the same contrariety A  ie Darkness ting'd every way with Light    actual mixture of Contrarieties in any point except that single one these must be entirely Improvements on the Original  The Misfortune is that in all Human Excellencies there will be an Alloy Faults spring out of our Improvements themselves and the very methods of Beautifying lead often into Blemishes The way to any Perfection is full of Difficulties and Windings on each side and every step out of the right Path tho' they cross each other every Moment is a wandering from our Design In a word  Philypsus  'tis much the same with Errors and Improvements as it is with Pleasure and Pain in the Philosopher's Fable they are blended together in such a manner that it is impossible to come at the one without touching upon the other  All the Methods which are us'd in Mr  Pope  's Translation and which are so often of great Efficacy towards beautifying and improving the Diction may sometimes fall under a different Character  Among the Words which are introduc'd from other Languages into our own there may be  Dexter circumfusile variegated  Od    some which still retain too much of the air of Foreigners As antiquated Words may  Seneschal viands bev'rage irefull  look too Grotesque or have a rough disagreeable sound The very Solemnity of Scriptural Expressions may sometimes require that they should not be  Jupiter  is stil'd  God  simply  Od      Neptune  A God above the Gods  Od    alienated at least it may make them look  To thee a Son is giv'n  Od  AndFood in the desart land behold is giv'n  Od    too high for the Passages in which they are inserted  Next to the importing of Words New to the Poetical Stile is the varying the use of the Old To deviate from the strictness of Grammar is what gave a rise to Rhetorick and surely there are few who wou'd not prefer all the beautiful Forms and Figures of the latter at least for Poetry and Oratory to that bare correctness which alone is the Province of the former Yet there may be Innovations on this too harsh or daring and Figures that may look more like Patchwork than true Ornaments in the Dress of Poetry  The greater danger is when the Poet assumes  Flown  with Insolence  Od    ilial  or a Daughter  any common Word in a new unusual Sense The worst Fault of any Language is Ambiguity that great cause of Darkness in Verse and the continuer of every Dispute that has been kept up for any time in Prose The various Appearances of words  Philypsus  should not be multiplied unnecessarily the Reader is apt to be distracted between so many Lights and in such a Variety may follow the false as well as the true  I have observ'd this particularly in Words deriv'd from other Languages These you know often prevail among  s very differently from their native signification The  Latin sense  perhaps is  ne thing and the  English use  another When this has obtain'd universally we  ught not to run back to the Latin  Partial Od        Objected    Impl  cite      ense of the word in our use of it If  ou should the Learn'd themselves may  ot readily fall into your meaning and  he Unlearn'd will inevitably mistake it  It may be enquir'd too how far this Translation may make a wrong use of Terms borrow'd from any of the Arts  nd Sciences As where we read of  Architraves  Colonnades  and the like I would not produce these as undoubted faults in the Poetical Stile tho' the banishing  all Technical Words  be laid down by some Criticks as a Rule never to be transgress'd I should imagine they might be admitted in some Cases even where there is not that absolute necessity either of using them or losing the Sense of the Original  Will not the very thing on which the Rule is founded allow the departing from it sometimes  "That the Poet writes to all Mankind in general  And  "That h  should avoid all appearance of Labour a  well as Affectation  is very true and very good reasons they are for his not using Technical Words while they carry difficulty and an Air of Affectation abou  them But if such words ever happen to be perfectly Familiarized by the Writing of former Poets or become of commo  Use in the World I should think the  have the same Right to be admitted int  Poetry and if not mean the same propriety as any other Words the most obvious and intelligible Any one may distinguish their greater or less fitness o  this Account in the description of  Al  nous  's Palace in which there are sever  Instances both of Terms familiariz'  and of such as are less allowable under one and the same view  The  Front  appear'd with radiant splendors gay  Bright as the lamp of Night or orb of Day  The walls were massy brass the  Cornice  high  Blue metals crown'd in colours of the sky  Rich plates of gold the  foldingdoors incase  The pillars silver on a brazen  base  Silver the  Lintels deepprojecting  o'er  Od    And gold the  ringlets  that command the door  Some of these Terms are certainly allowable And you will think perhaps I carry the matter too far in another Point which may seem as allowable to the full You must know I am apt to imagine that not only the more difficult Terms of Art but even such Words as are  Thus there is something which does not  ound entirely right in these lines  Full  shines  the Father  in the  Filial Frame Od  He ceas'd the  Filial Virtue  made reply Mean time  Arcte  for the hour of rest  Ordains  the fleecy couch The Peers reproach the sure  Divine  of fate  Within the  Stricture  of the palace wall  Imposthumate  with pride With  Venial  freedom let me now demand Thy name There cling  implicite  and confide in  Jove    The  Seneshal  rebuk'd in haste withdrew A  Cenotaph  I raise of deathless fame  surp'd  more particularly in any single  Province may become less fit to be used in Common If so it may require caution in inserting some that are  appropriated  to particular Persons or Things Many that are us'd much in the  Professions  especially in the  Scholastick  way of Distinctions and all in general that are perplex'd or not to be understood without Difficulty  I'm afraid I have tired you  Philypsus  with such a string of dry Observations they must have their Turn in a view of this Nature and to omit what is Necessary for fear of an imputation of Pedantry is perhaps the worst Pedantry one can be guilty of  Give me leave to enlarge more upon the Abuse of Epithets as I did befor  upon the Use of them 'Tis the same with these  Philypsus  as with all other Ornaments of Speech their being so very serviceable may lead to a large  Use of them than is proper but there is this Advantage too the very thing which makes them so strong and beautifull will help to discover any Error in their Application They are each connected so immediately to their Subject that their Impropriety as well as Agreement is very easily discern'd  On    Aristot Rhetor  Lib  p  this Account we should be the more cautious how we mix the Epithets of the  Proper  with any  Metaphorical  Expressions These for the Time change their Nature and may signifie things very different from what they stood for before That Metaphor which puts the Name of a  Place  or  Country  for its  Inhabitants  is reckon'd a great and agreeable one but wherever it is used we must remember it stands now for  Men  and is not to be consider'd in its proper  tate as a  Part of the Earth  If its old Epi  hets are still applied to it the Sense must  e disagreeing and confus'd  I fear we meet with something of this  here  Penelope  complains of the Numbers  nd Importunity of her Suitors after  his manner  Zacynthus  green with evershady groves  nd  Ithaca  presumptuous boast their loves  truding on my choice a second Lord  They press the  Hymenaean  rite  b Od    Longinus  Cap Ed Oxon  somewhere in his Treatise on the  sublime  gives us an instance of this sort of Metaphor from  Herodotus  where that Historian is speaking of a very moving Tragedy  at the Acting of which the Theatre burst into tears  This the Critick judges to be so taking from the surprize that Turn of Expression carries with it The Metaphor itself has certainly something great in it But had  Herodotus  join'd some of its proper Epithets or Description with this Mataphor and said that  The Theatre raised all o  Columns of the Corinthian Order burst into Tears at the deepness of the Tragedy  Longinus  might have thought the passage more  Surprizing  but I dare say he would not have thought it so worthy of hi  Commendation  To mix these things in a Description is really as Absurd as to paint a  River  God  not with his  Urn  to signifie wha  he is but gushing all over into Streams  like some of the odd Figures in  Ovid'  Metamorphosis  and by the way it ma  be a very good  Spectator  N  Rule that is given  try mixt Metaphors at any time b  forming in one's Mind a Picture fro  what is said and considering how th  Parts of it would agree were they delineated upon Canvass  There is another disagreement in Epithets when two Expressions proper in themselves are yet join'd together improperly After a great Slaughter we may very well have a Notion of  Heaps or  as it is in the Poetical language  Mountains of the Slain  'tis natural on the same Occasion to imagine to ourselves their Wounds and the  blood ebbing  out of them these are very proper separately but to join them under the Notion of a  Od    Bleeding Mountain  does not look so reconcileable to the Mind  An Error yet more frequent is when we give a word that Epithet which is proper to it on some Occasions indifferently at all times and without any Occasion  This in some Measure has been always allowable in Verse however such a Liberty is not without its bounds nor should it be used intemperately  Purple  for instance is an Epithet very frequent in the Ancient Poets for the Habit of Princes yet it is not to be given to that of all Great Men nor of Princes equally  whether    Arist Rhet  l c  young or old nor of the very same Prince under several Circumstances tho' a Remark of this kind may seem insignificant an Impropriety in this Case might be very gross and shocking  Again What is proper in one Language may not be so in another Was any one to Translate the  purpureis Oloribus  of  Horace Purple Swans  would not he be so  Literal  as to miss the  Sense  of his Author entirely  There may be another Impropriety from the difference of time and circumstances It may do very well to give the Epithet of  browzing  to a Goat or  grazing  to the Ox it helps to describe them in the Fields or to distinguish them from some other Creatures and if neither of these at least it gives the Language a Poetical Air Yet these Epithets have some restraints they belong to Life and Action they do not suit with those very Creatures when Dead and less so when they are cut out in the Shambles or serv'd up at a Feast this is the Case in a Passage relating to  Penelope's  Suitors they  A Luxurious race indulge their cheer  Devour the  grazing Ox  and  browzing Goat  Od    And turn the generous Vintage down their throat  As Epithets should be proper to the  Things  or  Person  they are spoken of so must we take Care that they are still proper to the  Metaphors  we add and in Allegory not to confound the Epithets of the  Real  with those of the  Fictitious Person  In the Preface to the  Iliad  Page  mo  we have an Excellent Distinction to this Purpose on a known    Epithet of  Apollo  Which as we are there told is capable of two Explications One Literal in respect of the Darts and Bow the Ensigns of that God the other Allegorical with regard to the Rays of the Sun therefore in such Places where  Apollo  is represented as a God in Person I would use the former Interpretation and where the Effects of the Sun are describ'd I wou'd make Choice of the latter  You see the justness of the Observation it may serve to explain my Meaning better than I could express it my self  'Tis Evident by the Way that Mr  Pope  form'd this Observation upon his Experience in the Progress of that Translation This appears from the first Part of that Work in which we sometimes find the Properties and Effects of the Sun blended with the personal Act  of  Apollo  thus it is in the first Appearance of that Deity in the Poem I shal  read the Passage to You tho' something long it begins with that beautiful line  Silent  Chryses  he wander'd by the sounding Shore  Till safe at distance to his God he prays  That God who  da  ts around the World his rays  O  Smintheus  sprung from fair  Latona's  line  Thou guardian power of  Cill  the Divine  Thou  source of Light  whom  T  n  dos  adores  And whose  bright  presence  gilds  thy  Chrysa's  shore  God of the Silver bow thy Shafts employ  Il    Avenge thy servant and the  Greeks  destroy  The Original here does not once Attribute any thing to the Deity but wha  is personal 'tis certain the Sun and i  Effects are hid under this Allegory but then they must be hid for so far a it appears it will cease to be Allegor  Homer  never mixes shadows and reality and as Mr  Pope  perceiv'd this in his goin  on with the Poem I presume he bui  upon it that excellent Observation  Any mixture of this Nature is more evident in Epithets for that obvious Reason I mention'd before And thus you see there are Inconveniences attend each Method of improving the Poetical Diction and that the danger bears some Proportion to the Excellence Where the finest Colourings are most visible the  aulty strokes of the Pencil are the sooner perceiv'd and when we meet with the greatest Improvements in a Piece we must  ot imagine it to be wholly without de  ect Of all Doctrines I shall never hold  hat which supposes any Man to be In  allible and of all Men the Poet of a  rue free glowing Spirit must naturally  e incapable of that Character No  hilypsus  the most  correct  Writer is he  hat has the  fewest  Faults and he is the  blest  Poet that has most distinct Excel  encies  You need not repeat says  Philypsus  hat you have throughly convinc'd me  f long since Yes 'tis the  Whoever thinks a faultless Piece to see  hinks what ne'er was nor is nor e'er shall be  Pope's  Essay on Criticism  Condi  on of every human Performance not to  e absolutely perfect I can allow of see  g Faults in any the most favourite Piece  nd find a fresh and greater Pleasure every  Day in reading an Author without that Biass which used to make me admire every thing I read Yet I must own my Infirmity to you I still find it very Difficult to arrive to that Indifference you would perswade in any Tolerable degree  A perfect Indifference answer'd  Antiphaus  is no more attainable than a perfect Excellence by a Creature made up of so many Passions as is Man We must poise ourselves with all the Steadiness we  re Masters of and when those Disturbers will be interfering the best way is to turn their own Artillery upon them and to play one Passion against another If the superiour Merit of a Writer or his engaging Way is apt to captivate us so far as to raise any partial regards in us we must stop and Consider what we owe to Truth the most beautifull and commanding thing in the World On the contrary whereever we begin to feel a malicious Pleasure in finding out the Faults of great Men we must break off that humour as soon as perceiv'd by turning immediately to some of the finest Passages in their Works and indulging that Delight and Admiration they raise in us  I do thus reply'd  Philypsus  and yet it is but too frequently that I find my self  more engag'd than I ought to be after all my Endeavours How happy should I be cou'd I have that command of my Temper which  Antiphaus  shews upon all Occasions  If you have observ'd any thing in me of that Nature says  Antiphaus  interrupting him it is chiefly owing to the Observance of this Rule  When we are thinking of any particular Passage to forget the Character of the Author and when we are speaking of the Character of the Author to forget the Turn of any particular Passage  Our Notion of a Poem is not to be influenc'd  y a few Lines taken here and there  rom it the only thi  g by which it can  e justly determin'd is the Ballance of the Account after reckoning up all its Beau  es and all its Defects against one ano  her I mean not only as to their  Num    but according to the real  Value  or  oy  that is in them But what am I  oing  Philypsus  to talk at this rate  hile I might be enjoying your Obser  tionsThe things I have heard you  eak of at Different Times make me  ng to see them in one collected View  e are here safe from the Impertinence  Business or Visits and may enjoy  r selves at Large without being inter  pted by either  I am sensible answer'd  Philypsus  after a short pause that what you particularly mean is the Improvements in Mr  Pope  's Translation from the many Figures and Variations added in that Work but as I am not prepared for a regular Account of them You will give me leave to mention them just as they come into my Thoughts My happiness is that I spea  to so generous a Friend I know  Antiphaus  too well to make Apologies fo  the Weakness of my Observations o  the loose manner in which I may lay my Thoughts before him  From  Aristotle's  Lib de  Poet  Cap    To be  Clear  and  not  to be  Mea  is the great Excellence of Languag  A Stile that is made up wholly of  proper  Words will be the clearest of any but at the same Time it will necessaril  be mean On the Contrary the i  prov'd  figurative  Stile is great but  it be Crowded every where with F  gures and new Terms it must gro  dark and barbarous  If this Rule be just as it has ever be  allow'd to be quite down from the  Gre  Father of Criticism at  Athens  to tho who Flourish now in the Academy  Paris  all Additional Figures in th  Translation which neither darken nor perplex the Sense are so many new Beauties and Improvements upon the Original  For my part I should not stick at carrying this Point farther I should imagine That Figures are the Language of the Passions The Body it self is agitated and our Features discompos'd when the Mind is struck violently with any Object and if we speak upon such Occasions 'tis with rapidity and disorder We  ourst out into Exclamations our Senti  ents are quick and violent and our Language interrupted frequently with  uddain Starts and as suddain Pauses Things appear then more strong and  argely to the Mind and we paint them  more expressive Colours with a greater  nergy of Words 'Tis this way of  eaking that gave rise to what the Cri  cks afterwards call'd Figures These  re the beautiful Disorders of Language  ey are in our Words what suddain Agi  tions are in our Minds and tho' we  ay think them chiefly the effect of Art  ey are really the most natural things  Poetry  When we are struck suddainly with  y or Sorrow Hopes or Fears we  eak out in a short quick manner of  Expression  Ulysses  in the Habit of a stranger finds the good old  Laertes  ever sorrowing for his Absence and bu  ying himself in his Garden to divert the melancholly of his Thoughts The Hero does not discover himself immediately only just mentions to him that he had seen  Ulysses  in his Travels That is the point  Laertes  fixes upon  This Island you are landed upon  says he  is Ithaca  But tell me Stranger be the Truth confess'd  What years have circled since thou saw'st that guest  That hapless guest alas for ever gone  Wretch that  e was and that I am my Son  If ever Man to misery was born  Od    'Twas his to suffer and 'tis mine to mourn  Ul  sses  in his Answer informs him where he had met with his Son and that when the  parted he  latter'd himself with ho  es of seeing him again but now he found he must despair of that happiness This was too much for  Laertes  to bear  we see him overcome with Sorrow 'Tis now  Ulysses  's turn to be agitated and t  speak his Passions in the same impetuou  manner  He ran he seiz'd him with a strict embrace  With thousand kisses wander'd o'er his face  "I I am he Oh Father rise Behold  "  Od      Thy son  I can scarce leave the pleasure I take in repeating these Passages only to tell you that they are extremely improv'd by Mr  Pope  No one will imagine how much that has not compar'd them with the Original  You see these Passions break out in short violent Flashes sometimes they are so strong as to permit no more than one word or two When  Euryclea  by accident discovers  Ulysses  she can only cry out  Od    My SonMy King  And where any go farther they rather  hint  at things than  mention  them Their Thoughts are  ull of starts and hurry they speak with vehemence and often end abruptly Thus  Ulysses  when he discovers himself  o  Telemachus  I am thy Father O my Son my Son  That Father for whose sake thy days have run  Od    Od    One scene of woe c  And in another place from a different Passion  O curst event and Oh unlook'd for aid  anthius  or the women have betray'd  Oh my Dear Son  These passionate  Breaks  are one of the finest things in Poetry They are as natural in Anger as they are in Sorrow or Suprizes and indeed in the former are proper sooner and upon less motives far than in these I know not how it is they have a particular aptness in all Threats and either intimate very strongly or are very well fill'd up with som  menacing Action  This choice is left you to resist or die  Od    And die I trust Ye shall  Or as in the  Nineteenth  Book  Vagrant be gone before this blazing brand  Od    Shall urgeand wav'd it hissing in her hand  You have puzzled me says  Antiphaus  Now for my Life can't I tell which to approve of most the expressing or the i  timating the Action in such Cases th  requires the greatest strength in the Poe  and the other has greater force in h  Performance Oh give me leave to me  tion one thingHave you not observ  a Larger sort of Break which is us  artificially in a Poem to incite the A  tention of the Reader I mean wh  the Narration is dropt in the most engaging parts of it or just before some very material Incident This adds a double desire of hearing the Audience generally make it their Request that the Speaker would go on and inform them of the Sequel Thus it is in the Eleventh  Odyssey Ulysses  in the midst of his Account of the Infernal Regions  Od    Verse  And V  Alcinous  desires him to proceed  makes a feint of concluding we are immediately told that the  Phaeacians  were eager to hear him on and 'tis observable that the very  Donec Calchante ministroTum vero ardemusscitari  Aen    and  same Break and the very same Sentiment after it is imitated by  Virgil  'Tis indeed improv'd in the latter he has all the Use of  Homer  's suspence without the Tediousness of it  I have often taken notice of this Arti  ice says  Philypsus  'Tis very usual in the Close of the particular Books not only of this Poem but equally of the  Iliad  and  Aeneid  Were it not a thing pretty obvious in itself I should be apt to imagine that it was from this practice of  Homer  and  Virgil  that those prudent  Authors who write for Sale had learnt what is so common among them Thus in our Books of Adventures and Romance we seldom meet with a First Part which does not break off in such a point of the Story as may be most apt to engage the Expectation of the Reader and to draw him in for that most tedious thing in the World vulgarly call'd  A Second Part  There is yet another sort of Breaks  Antiphaus  which proceed not from the Artifice of the Writer but the Passion he feels upon some great or unexpected Calamity There might be Instances of this given from the Poem before us but we must go to another Piece of Mr  Pope's  for the finest that ever I met with in my Life 'Tis in his Charming  Ode  on  Musick  where he is speaking of that great Master of it  Orpheus  Sta  za  the th  See wild as the winds o'er the mountains he  lies  Hark  Haemus  refounds with the  Bacchinals  cries  Ah see he dies  Those Passions which break off our Language in this manner and confine it to short catches and starts when they are wrought up to the highest pitch or croud in many of them together upon  the Mind are best exprest by  Silence  Such Silences as these pardon me a Paradox as old as  the Disciples of  Pythagoras    Philo  ratus  de Vita  Apol  Lib  Cap  Pythagoras  his times are the voice of Nature 'Tis true in the common Method of speaking there are only a few particular Organs concern'd but in stronger Emotions in the violence of any Passion the whole Body may be  talkative  Every Look and Turn and Motion is significant and each Nerve can have its share in making up what our  Shakespear  calls  A kind of Excellent Dumb Discourse  To be more plain Our Passions are often too strong to be express'd immediately by words they often choak up the passage for them and yet at the same time they are most apparent The more any one is a stranger to art and disguises the more is he moved on these Occasions these Silences are the pure effects of Nature and the Descriptions of them are some of the most natural as well as most beautiful Passages in the whole Poem  The Recovery of  Ul  sses  is the Incident of the greatest concern to all his Friends and must be attended with the strongest flow of Passion in them accordingly they are each too much mov'd with the discovery to utter their Sentiments on that Occasion  Telemachus  is the first to whom  Ulysses  makes himself known He falls on his Father's Neck and they continue embracing each other without speaking  Od    for a considerable timeWe have a like Scene  Od    when he discovers himself to two or three select Friends Good old  Laertes  on the same Occasion is not only silent but scarce  Od    able to support himself under such an excess of Passion And the fond tender  Penelope  is quite overcome with it  Od    She sickens trembles falls and faints away  A Great Surprize or Extraordinary Fright has the same Effect as in  Homer  's  Od    Eurylochus  and the Sir  Trevisan  of  Spencer  which the  Od    Notes mention as a Parallel to  Eurylochus  Never was any Image set in a fuller Light than this of  Spencer's  'tis presented to our View  with all the strength that Poetry is capable of I must beg leave to read it to you  He answer'd nought at all but adding new  Fear to his first amazement staring wide  With stony eyes and heartless hollow hue  Astonish'd stood as one that had espy'd  Infernal furies with their chains unty'd  Him yet again and yet again bespake  The gentle Knight who nought to him reply'd  But trembling every joint did only quake  Admirable Imagery and admirable Silence cry'd  Antiphaus  But I hope you will not be so possess'd with the excellence of our Poet as to forget  Od    the  Ajax  of  Homer  whom  Ulysses bespeaks again and yet again  without any Answer at all Or perhaps this has been observ'd upon so often that you think it needless to repeat its Beauties I don't question but you admire it very much I do so answer'd  Philypsus  and agree entirely with the Observation  Note  ibid  and  Longi    θ  That  Ajax  has more the air of Grandeur when he says nothing than when the Poet makes him speak  Mr  Pope  does not only follow  Homer  very finely wherever he has led the Way  n these beautiful Figures he sometimes  heightens and sometimes adds them with a great deal of Propriety Every one sees how unwilling  Calypso  is to part with  Ulysses  But the Command of  Jove  must be obey'd and the same fondness which makes her look on the departure of that Hero with extreme regret engages her at the same time to assist him in the conveniences for it She is always directing him when employ'd and when not secretly disswading him from his Voyage We see her busy even to Officiousness in bringing him the Instruments for his Work guiding him to the Forest and shewing what Trees are fittest for his Purpose  Od    On the lone Islands utmost verge there stood  Of poplars pines and firs a lofty wood  Whose leafless summits to the skies aspire  Scorch'd by the sun or sear'd by heavenly f  re  Already dry'dThese pointing out to view  The nymph just shew'd him and with tears withdrew  This is much better express'd than in the Original indeed there we scarce discern that it is a passionate Silence Improvements of this kind  Antiphaus  are the more to be valu'd because there is not any one thing in Poetry of greater Beauty and Energy The Criticks look  upon it as the most    Longinus  nd  Cicero  Rarum est eloquenter loqui  iu  eloquenter  acere Ep ad  Atticum  L  sublime unusual part of Eloquence and 'tis none of its least Advantages that it hits that excellent Rule they give us  Of  See  Dem Phal    Leaving some things for the Audience to perceive of themselves  Tho' it be not told him every Man very easily finds out the heightning of such a Circumstance and is sure to value it the more because he finds it out himself In short these are Masterly s  rokes and few hands arrive to them in their true Excellence Tho' it requires the greatest Art and Judgment to introduce it the Writer when he has chose the proper Point seems to be put to no pains to rule our Affections he governs all our Passions without the  Labour  of Words and looks as  Archimedes  would  o one's fancy moving the whole Wor  d while he  sits still  himself  Suspence and Doubt have something of this Figure intermixt with them A Speaker hesitating and unresolv'd is in  State of  Halfsilence  As we see the former poetical Silence is observ'd in  H  mer  every time  Ulysses  discovers himself  to any of his nearer Friends so is there a mixture of this Doubtfulness also in each of those Interviews Thus  Telemachus  on that Occasion  Thou art notno thou can'st not be my Sire  Heaven such illusion only can impose  Od    By the false joy to aggravate my woes  The  Unravelling  of the Doubt is what strikes us most both in  Laertes  and  Penelope  in the latter Case this is deferr'd for too long a time However as they are they afford us some of the most pathetick Passages in the whole Poem In what an affecting Manner does  Laertes  appear to us just at the point of his being convinc'd that the Stranger he is conversing with is his Son  Smit with the signs which all his doubts explain  His heart within him melts his knees sustain  Their feeble weight no more  his arms alone  Support him round the lov'd  Ulysses  thrown  He faints he sinks with mighty joys opprest  Ulysses  clasps him to his eager breast  Soon as returning Life regains its seat  And his breath lengthens and his pulses beat  Yes I believe he cries Almighty  Jove    Heaven rules us yet and Gods there are above  Od    'Tis so  As to  Penelope  Where a modern would have been overjoy'd and caught immediately at an Occasion for so many raptures the  Greek  Poet chuses rather to shew her Prudence than her Passion I believe every body will agree that this  still Interval  is not illchosen the fault of it is its being carried through too many Lines The Queen no doubt struggled hard all the while She had difficulty enough in restraining herself And the moment she is convinc'd she is all Tenderness and Passion  While yet he speaks her powers of life decay  She sickens trembles falls and faints away  At length recovering to his arms she flew  And strain'd him close as to his breast she grew  The tears pour'd down amain And oh she cries  Let not against thy Spouse thine anger rise  O vers'd in every turn of human art  Forgive the weakness of a woman's heart  O let me let me not thine anger move  That I forborethusthusto speak my love  Thus in fond kisses while the transport warms  Pour out my Soul and die within thy arms  Od    I yield I yield my own  Ulysses  lives  This unravelling of a  Doubt  is generally follow'd by what is the most contrary to it of any thing in the World  Precipitation  To doubt of any happy  Circumstance is to fear that it should not prove true When we are agitated by the Expectation of some Bliss we long to indulge that Flow of Spirits which it Occasions only some particular Caution forces us to restrain them in the midst of their Career The moment our Doubt is clear'd and the Obstacle remov'd they rush on with the greater Violence and Impetuosity Then are our Words quick and vehement We speak short and fast A Thousand things We want to say and are so eager we don't know which of them to say first I know nothing in Musick that strikes me equally to those  sudd  in Pauses  when the Consort stops at  nce and after the still Interval breaks out unexpectedly into a full Tumult of Harmony This Pause and the Impetuousness that succeeds upon it  the case to carry on a Scene which w  have touch'd upon twice or thrice already when  Telemachus  recognizes his Father  Telemachus  wants to know ever  thing at once and  Ulysses  wants to te  him every thing as fast  All All  Ulysses  instant made reply  Od    I tell thee All my Son  Such an Hurry of Spirits the more violent it is makes us speak in the more broken and interrupted manner You always see that a Croud is the longest in getting out of a place where they are in the greatest Haste and press most When the Passions are less disturb'd they go in Train and follow one another easily but if they move all of them for a Passage at the same time they hinder one another This sort of Precipitation  s very well express'd in  Penelope  upon  eceiving  Telemachus  after his Voyage  Few words she spoke tho' much s  e had to say  d scarce those few for tears cou'd force their way  ight of my Eyes He comesUnhop'dfor Joy  s Heaven from  Pylos  brought my lovely Boy  snatch'd from all our cares Tell hast thou known  O      Thy Fathers Fate and tell me all thy Own  You cannot imagine  Antiphaus  the  ll heightning of this Passage without  omparing it with the Original 'Tis  e same case in most that I have menon'd They are some of the justest Im  ovements in the Poem as well as In  nces of the best sort of Figures such  shew the Passions of the Mind in a  ong and lively manner There are other  which the Poet makes use of sometimes to raise and diversify his Language sometimes to give stronger Colours to the things he describes And sometimes to engage or possess his Readers I need not enter into a long Enquiry concerning the more known Figures of either kind but shall touch upon one or two which as yet have not been introduc'd by the Criticks into their  Systems  Poetical Prophecy  is when we acquain  the Reader beforehand of some Events which will happen in the Progress of th  Poem  Prevention  is when we speak o  such things yet to come as if they we  already present  Prevention  gives an u  common Greatness and Energy to th  Language It places distant Actions fu  before our Eyes and carries a certa  Boldness and Assurance with it that very becoming The  other  is of gre  Strength in possessing and captivating t  Reader We love to look on into Fut  …rity Thus it flatters the Powers a  Capacity of our own Minds at the sa  time that it gives an Air of Super  Knowledge and Authority to the Poe  From the Invocation of the Muse the entrance to his Poem the Poet h  a Right of Prophecying and it mig  be  rtly  from this that the Name  Prophet  and  Poet  has in some Languages been us'd in common But tho' he may and does prophecy in Person things of this Nature are usually introduc'd from others as from Superior Beings from Priests and Augurs from  As  Tiresias  in the th  Odyss  y  or  Anchises  in the th  Aeneid  Persons in the other State or just at the  See  Il  π' Ver and  Aen    Point of Departing from this This latter Method perhaps may carry the greater  Sanction  with it but the other is the more  Poetical  Some of the strongest Speeches in  Homer  and  Virgil  are deliver'd after this manner by Men of the Prophetick Character It is to this Figure if you will give me leave to call it so that the  Sixth Book  of the  Aeneid  and the  Fourth  of the  Odyssey  owe the greatest share of their Beauty Even the frightful Raptures of  Theoclymenus  and the  Harpye  of  Virgil  engage the Reader with a sort of pleasing Terrour There is something horribly delightful in these Lines  Floating in gore portentous to survey  In each discolour'd vase the Viands lay  Then down each cheek the Tears spontaneous flow  And suddain Sighs precede approaching woe  In vision rapt the  Th  oclymenus  Hyper  sian  Seer  Uprose and thus divin'd the Vengeance near  O Race to Death devote with  Stygian  shade  Each destin'd Peer impending Fates invade  With tears your wan distorted cheeks are drown'd  With sanguine drops the walls are rubied round  Thick swarms the spacious hall with howling Ghosts  To people  Orcus  and the burning Coasts  Nor gives the Sun his golden O  b to roll  Od    But universal Night usu  ps the Pole  I beg pardon says  Antiphaus  but the Speech of  Theoclymenus  is a particular Favourite of mine and now you repeat it in  English  I seem to want something of that strong Pleasure it used to afford me Where the  Greek  speaks      Of the Su  being perisht out of Heaven and of Darkness rushing over the Earth  I cannot express the Fulness of the WordsBut you know the Original and I fear will never see a Translation equal it This whole Prophetical Vision of the Fall of the Suitors is the  True Sublime  and in particular gives us an higher  Orientalism  than we meet with in any other part of  Homer  's Writings You will pardon me a new Word where we have no old one to my Purpose You know what  I mean That  Eastern way of expressing R  volutions in Government by a Confusion or Extinction of Light in the Heavens  It is this manner of Thinking which works up that Speech the nearest of any to those noble Passages in holy Scripture  Joel    I will shew Wonders in the Heavens and in the Earth Blood and Fire and Pillars of Smoak the Sun shall be turn'd into Darkness and the Moon into Blood  Amos    I will cause the Sun to go down at Noon and I will darken the Earth in the clear Day  Ezek    All the bright Lights of Heaven will I make Dark over thee and set Darkness upon thy Land  I have often wondered  Philypsus  at some particular Persons who are ever ravish'd with any thing of the Sublime in common Authors and yet seem to have no taste for the finest touches of this kind those which are so frequent in our sacred Writings With what Greatness and Sublimity do they abound Such as might perswade that weare not only blest with  Instructions  but favour'd too with a  Language  from Heaven Those sacred Pages want only to be read with  common regard that all Men might acknowledge them to contain the greatest  Masterpieces of Eloquence Yes  Philypsus  it is there that Eloquence sit  beside the Throne of Truth in all he  noblest Attire and with a Look tha  strikes us at once with Reverence and Delight I long to expatiate on so gloriou  a Subject but perhaps we may find  time of joining together in some View o  this Nature There has been a very goo  Blackwall  's Sacred Classicks  Example set the World this last Summer and if ever we should follow i  and enter thoroughly into this sort  Criticism I dare say it will make an  other kind look poor and insipid whe  compared with itBut at present  are in another Sphere and I have alrea  interrupted you too much  Philypsus  desirous as he was to laun  immediately into those noble Depths  Eloquence comply'd for the present a  return'd to the point in hand  My l  Instance from the  Odyssey  prevents wh  I had design'd for the next You  it speaks all along of future things  if they were actually present  Theo  menus  has the whole fact passing successi  ly before his Eyes The Destruction  the Suitors is pictur'd in his Mind  sees their  blood  sprinkled upon the Wa  their  bodies  floating in Gore and their  ouls  sinking to the Regions of the Dead  Now I am upon this head of  Prophecy  nd  Prevention  I should be very defective  ere I to omit the other Branch of it  hich takes in all cases where the Poet  orewarns us of Events in his own proper  erson This is to be found in the very  ame point the Fate of the Suitors but  is not deliver'd with the same Air of  nthusiasm The  Poet  is inform'd by the  u  e of things to come while the  Pro  et  is possess'd by Vision The know  dge of one is from Instruction of the  her from a sort of Frantick Possession  Mind The Poet therefore antici  tes Events with less emotions of Lan  age and seldom rises into any fervor  ove what we meet with in these Passa  s  Incens'd they spoke  hile each to chance ascrib'd the wondrous stroke  nd as they wereFor death even now invades  His destin'd prey and wraps them all in shades  And before  In his Soul fond joys arise  his proud hopes already win the prize  speed the f  ying shaft thro' every ring  etch is not thine the arrows of the King  Shall end those hopes  and fate is on the wing    Od    b Od    You observe  Antiphaus  that this Event which is so often anticipated by the Poet is the great Point on which the Completion of his Fable turns and I believe you may have observ'd that  Virgil  puts on the Prophetick air  See  Aen    exactly in the same Case  Virgil  oftentimes improves upon his Master the Circumstance that introduces that Passage in the  Aeneid  and the greater distance of time give it a much finer and a nobler Air than we find in  Homer  himself  These Figures for so I beg leave to call all unusual manners of Speech are of more difficult Observation as they lye out of the common road I am afraid of wandering too far and shall therefore return very readily to the more beaten Path  All Passions warm the Imagination and make its Images more strong and sensible It is this in my Opinion tha  might render  Metaphors  very proper in the Pathetique Tho' you and I perhaps should not agree entirely on tha  Head  At least this is certain that the  strengthen and enliven the narrative Par  of Poetry beyond any other Metho  whatever when the Poet treats of the most common things he does not treat of them in the common manner  Fame speaks the  Trojans  bold they boast the skill  To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill  To dart the spear and guide the rushing car  With dreadful inroad thro' the walks of war  Od    Strip these Lines of the Metaphor and they lose their greatest Force and Beauty To say barely as it is in the  Greek That the Trojans are good Warriors that they lanch the Spear and handle the Arro  well that they manage their Horses de  trously and in general that they are  e  y Strong and Successful in Battle  This  eclares the whole of the thing but with Submission 'tis more like a Prose  han a poetical Narration at least when compar'd with the same Sentiments in  hose Lines I have just repeated  There are many Innovations of this  nd which make the English  Homer  ap  ear with Advantage A naked relation  f Fact is enough for History but Poe  y requires something more than bare  ruth It has a thousand ways of rai  g and beautifying its Subject  Phoebu    the Luminary over which he presides  does not only shew but sets a Lustre too on every thing he touches The Poet is not so much to declare Events as to give its Colours and Life to every Action in doing this nothing is so requisite as strong animated Figures as of all Figures the Metaphor affords the most sensible Strokes and comes nearest to the Pencil  Even in common Cases they are not without their Beauty thus in that Enterview between  Ulysses  and  Laertes  Beneath a neighb'ring tree the chief divine  Gaz'd o'er his Sire retracing every line  The ruins of himself  now worn away  Od    With age yet still majestick in decay  Thus  Agamemnon  after all his dangers murther'd by the hands of Villains in his own Kingdom is not said barely to  die  but  to end  Od    The sad Evening of a stormy life  When this Figure expresses some strang  Particularity or includes any magnifying Comparison one single Word is ver  powerful in raising the Narration an  enlarging our Ideas up to the Occasion  With dreadful shouts  Ulysses pour'd  along  Od    Swift as an Eagle as an Eagle strong  Now by the Sword and now the Jav'lin fall  Od    The rebel Race and Death had  swallow'd  all c  I know no Case in which Metaphors of a bold Sound are more proper than in arrogant Speeches When Men defy the Gods or quarrel with the Dispensations of Providence  Philaetius  in the  Od  ssey  is no arrogant Character Yet in one place upon considering the Afflictions of his Prince whose Piety and Virtue he was so well assur'd of he falls into a Rant against Providence in which the Language is as lively and vigorous a  the Sentiment is illgrounded and absurd  O  Jove  for ever deaf to human cries  The tyrant not the father of the skies  Unpiteous of the race thy will began  The fool of Fate thy manufacture Man  With penury contempt repulse and care  Od    The gauling load of Life is doom'd to bear  These Metaphors which are of that  ind we may call  The audacious  come  ery near the Spirit of  Oldham  and  Dryden  ho undoubtedly in their Satirical  orks flash out into the greatest Bold  esses this way of any of our Writers  deed in both there are some which  may come too near to Prophaneness but we must always take care not to attribute to the Poet what he speaks under some other Person A Devil is no longer a Devil unless he be haughty impenitent and blaspheming and  Dryden  is no more to be condemn'd than  Milton  for making such impious Spirits speak according to their true Character  What y  u assert I take to be perfectly true says  Antiphaus  but were I blest with any Genius for Poetry I own that a shocking Impiety should be one of the last things I would  chuse  to describe And where it is ch  sen there is room to be m  derate with  ut i  juring the Character with t  o grea  a shew  f Go  dness We see that  Milton  is not so gross as  Dryden  Nor  Virgil  seldom descends to particulars h  c  uses rather to say in g  n  al  Atque D  s a  q  a  tra vocat crud  l a m  r  v  n his  i  ore reserv'd than  Hom  r'  Deisrs He rather  idicules than aff  nts  As  a  me Divum p  ter a  q  Hominum R  x Viderit  Afterwards he grow  little Wa  mer and more Me  apho  ical  D  xtra mihi Deus  lum quod missile libro Nunc adsint  Where he speaks plainest of all  Virgil  touch  upon his miserable fa  e in the very next line  N  c mort  m horremus  nec Divum parcimus  D  sine Jam venio moriturus  Aen  Virgil  so blunt as  Homer  Well says  Philypsus  there are other Points which you might chuse and which serve as well for this sort of Metaphor Thus all pious Fra uds infamous Priests or any prevailing Superstition Here the Figure retains much of the audacious Air without any thing of Impiety in it  Agamemnon  indeed goes too far in the  Iliad  where he seems to neglect  Apollo  as well as his Priest  Hence with thy lawrel crown and golden rod  Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy God  Il    Mine is thy daughter Priest  Here is something of Irreverence to the God and an evident Injustice to Man  nd the Poet very prudently condemns  he Speech before he delivers it in his  oem But there is no such Mark s  t  n one of  Hector's  nor does it at all in  ringe that Hero's Character which is  emarkably Pious all through the Poem  e is speaking against a very popular  uperstition the Trade of Augury  Ye Vagrants of the Sky your wings extend  where the Suns arise or where descend  o right to left unheeded take your way  hile I the dictates of high Heaven obey  ithout a sign his Sword the brave man draws  Il    And asks no Omen but his Country's cause  This has the  audacious  Air because it speaks contemptuously of a Practice which was vulgarly look'd upon as religious and sacred and is  just  because it shews at the same time the greatest Reverence to the Gods He obeys the Dictates of  Heaven  but he contemns the Artifices of  the Priest  Whatever restraints this kind of Metaphor may deserve there is another sort which has always been receiv'd with the greatest Liberty The  animating  Metaphor tho' the  Praecipuè ex his oritur mira sublimitas qu  ud  ci  proxima  periculo translationis attollitu  T  llun  ur quum rebus sensu carentibus actu  quendam animos damus  Quintil  Lib Cap  Aristotle  and  Phala  eus  say exactly the same s  e the la  er    most Sublime and the most Daring of any except what was last mention'd is very common and that even in the chastest Poets and in the foftest Pieces It is this by which we give Action and Spirit to things that are Still and Insensible This will raise the meanest Points in the World it may treat meer  Names  as if they were  Things  and Things still and inanimate as i  they had Thought and Action Wha  migh  seem the most surprising is tha  this method of raising things above thei  Nature has nothing of ridiculous in it We easily perceive this to be true but I own for my part I should have been at a loss for the reason of it had not I met with a  Od  Vol  Pag  fine Observation in Mr  Pope  's  Appendix  to this Work I wonder now why I cou'd not before perceive That  Ridicule is confin'd to moral Agents and obtains only where Choice and Freedom is directly concern'd  That this is the Case is the more plain because even among moral Agents the very same thing which if brought on by our own Folly is a certain subject for Ridicule when it proceeds from some inevitable Misfortune or Necessity is the farthest from being Ridiculous  I am pleased to see that this Figure stands on such good reason for it is the very Life and Soul of Description And might it not be of a larger Use  Antiphaus  than has commonly been observ'd It is chiefly mention'd indeed of enlivening things inanimate Whereas possibly it may hold thro' the whole Chain of Beings in the World as they rise gradually  bove one another Thus when we attribute any thing of absolute Perfection to the highest Orders of created Beings  any thing which we think Angelical to Man or any thing like Humanity or Virtue to Beasts it might as well be included in this Branch of Metaphor as when we give the Powers of Motion to things Still or Passions to things Inanimate  Nay it may even return from the Lower to the Higher when the Species of a lower Rank upon the whole has any  As when we amplify the Swiftness of a  Hero by comparing it to the Flight of an Eagle  or  particular Excellence which the higher wants Or partakes of any  the Swiftness of an Eagle by comparing i  to the Swiftness of the Winds  Excellence which is common to them both in a greater and more excellent Degree  But it must be observ'd that where this Figure in its higher Notion is applied to Intelligents it must not be done with the same Indifference or rather it requires the strictest Caution  The Poet is at liberty to attribute Action and Passions to any part whatever of the mute Creation he may make the Woods or any such Insensible Sympathize with his Grief with the same freedom as any inferiour Animals we find it thus used particularly in all the  Pastorol  Writers whether Ancient or Modern Every Beast may have the Compassion of Man but few Men can sustain the Properties of an Angel Nothing would make a common Mortal so mean and ridiculous as such an Elevation the same holds in the higher Intelligents The First of the Angelick Order looks mons  rously ridiculous as well as monstrously impious when he would imagine an Equality where there was an immutable Disproportion  However in some Cases the Property of an Angel may be given to a Man The Heathen Poets compare their greater Her  's to their Gods And when the Christian Poet extols any superiour Ge  ius any Character that has something  n it above the common race of Mortals  e may well draw some Expressions from  he Order of Beings next above the Hu  an Had not Mr  Addison  thought  is Justif  able we should have lost one  f t  e finest Amplifications imaginable  See  Addison's  Works Vol Pag  So when an Angel by Divine command  i  h  is  g  empest  sh  ke  a guilty land  uch  s of late o'er pal  B  itannia past  m and serene he drives the furious blast  d pleas'd th' Almighty's o  ders to perform  ides in the whirlwind and directs the storm  But whither am I wandring my  Antiphaus  You will think such Flights as these too Airy surely I am got into the Wilds of CriticismI don't know what the World might think of You at present says  Antiphaus  but if ever Mr  Dryden's  Scheme should take place and the Poetical Characters of Angels be generally establish'd what you may think the wildest of your Flights now might then be of good Service this way in PoetryBe that as it will says  Philypsus  I believe I had better draw in my thoughts a little for the present and keep to things that are more obvious and secure All agree that the giving  Thought  to things  insensible  and  human  Passions to the  brute  part of the Creation is equally just and beautiful and at the same time nothing is of greater Efficacy in rendring our Sentiments Rais'd and Poetical That  The Sufferings of our Fellowcreatures affec  our Souls by a natural Sympathy  is a very good moral Sentence but the Poet is to Elevate this effect of Misery he invest  her with a sort of new  Being  and the  gives her  Address  and  Action  In Poetry our Tears  Od    speak  our Misfortunes ar  Od    Eloquent  and  Misery appears  Od  As  Aen    in Person to plead for the distress'd  When more uncommon things are transfer'd this way the Metaphor may be safer if it has some grounds in the Fact tho' it will bear very often without it 'Tis allowable to represent the Sea as flying back and astonish'd at the  terrible c Voice of the Cyclops  but 'tis more close to attribute this Fear and Flight to it when its Waves are  Od    Aen    drove asunder by the same Cyclops flinging a Rock into the midst of it  Another thing which made this Fi  ure the stronger among the Ancients  as their Notion of  Genii  or  presiding  eities  In particular there was scarce  River or Brook amongst them but what  ad its  Genius  and in speaking of these  he Poets carry this Metaphor farther  an in any other case whatever What  Appearance does  Xanthus  and  Simois  ake in the  Battle of Rivers  which  kes up the  st Iliad  What a bold  raught is that of the  Nile  in the Sea  ht at  Actium  by  e Virgil  And how  uch more Sublime than either is our  ranslation of the Sacred Writings  where it makes  the Deep  Habakkuk    utter his voice and lift up his hands on high  You may perceive I am run into another Figure but it is of a kind so nearly allied to the  animating Metaphor  that one often finds some difficulty in distinguishing the one from the other Indeed when any of these  Personages  are introduced distinctly in full State then it is something beyond Metaphor but in short Sketches it may pass very well under that Figure There is nothing but a stronger Name adapted to the thing than its strictly proper Acceptation affords I think for instance that we need not seek for a new Figure in this Passage  Aw'd by the Prince so haughty brave and young  Od    Rage gnaw'd  the Lip  Amazement chain'd  the Tongue  Or for this  In every sorrowing soul I pour'd delight  Od    And  Poverty stood smiling  in my sight  In the close of this Poem the Narration is elevated by a successive Chain of these  Metaphors  or  Fictions  call them which you will When the  Ithacen  ians  are rang'd in Arms against their Prince 'tis not said that they  shall Die  but that  Od    Death attends them in the Field  To express  Ulysses  's aptness to forgive them  Od    Oblivion is ready to stretch her Wings over their Offences  As when they are shockt with their Crime and fling down their Arms there is this Voice from Heaven to effect it  Forbear ye Nations your mad hands forbear  Od    From mutual slaughter  Peace descends to spare  These  Antiphaus  are the most remarkable things I have taken notice of as to the Figures I could have produc'd a greater number of excellent Lines from this Translation had not I  ndeavour'd chiefly to give such Instances  s contain'd at the same time some peculiar Improvements in them You would be surprized to see how many Beauties  hey have that are wanting in the Ori  inal  Surely they who are the most rigid  or Closetranslating will allow such beautiful Variations as these which without losing the Sentiments of the Ori  inal only set a finer Turn upon them  Let them call them if they please glorious Offences or beautiful Wandrings from the Letter these are such Offences as one would wish to see more frequent than they are and of which the best Translators are the most guilty  For my part I am particularly pleased when I see a Translator reflect new Light upon his Original whereever this is done justly it does not alter the Objects it only makes them more bright and visible  I believe  Antiphaus  you will not disapprove of some other Methods us'd in the English  Odyssey  for this Purpose which I am just going to lay before you Sometimes the Language is rais'd and strengthen'd sometimes the Order transpos'd to Advantage in several Cases w  have  Homer  's Thoughts inspirited b  collateral Thoughts from other Authors some little things are omitted and som  short strokes added to correct the Sentiment or to heighten the Colours in th  Original  Before you enter upon those Point  says  Antiphaus  give me leave to mentio some few things which look like Bl  mishes under the Subject you have ju  concluded  It is allow'd that Metaphors are the most useful of Figures to raise the Poetical Stile to give their Colour to our Descriptions and a just Swelling and Relief to our Images 'Tis allow'd that a Translator may add these Colours where the Original is less Lively and Expressive than the Subject may very well bear The Faults then must lie either in the Excess or Impropriety of such Additions Some things will not bear a strong Light and others require to be flung into Shades  Where there is no Occasion for Figures they are at best only so many unnecessary  Ornaments  I cannot see why a Quiver full of Arrows should be call'd  Od    A Store of flying Fates  why a Fire should be term'd  Od    A burning Bed  or a Libation  Od    The Sable Wave of offer'd Wine  'Tis not the Disproportion of the Me  aphor to the Thing which might render  hese Expressions blameable If any thing  tis the want of Occasion When the  oet is to aggrandize small Subjects we  an bear with much bolder Metaphors  an these tho' it may not be proper to  call a stream of Wine by the Title of a  Sable Wave  on common Occasions Yet when the Work requires heightening we may go so much farther as to call a  As does  Virgil  Georg  small River by the Name of the Ocean  If we judge by the  Occasion  there can be but few liberties for Metaphor in common Conversation I mean the common Conversation of Poetry Not that they are to be banish'd thence entirely rather it will require them frequently but it requires only such as are single and not far remov'd from the Subject When a Person is speaking to  Penelope  in Commendation of  Ithaca  he might be allow'd to say that  Its Soil is  rich  that it  ab  unds  in Corn and that its Trees ar  laden  with Fruit Homer  's Expression  scarce carry this so far and yet I shoul  think them preferable to these in th  Translation  Od  See V ib    In wavy Gold thy summer vales are dress'd  Thy autumns bend with copious fruits oppress'd  Where the Original says that  Eur  mus was among the Suitors of Penelope  do not it seem better as well as plain  than this Translation  To climb with haughty fires  Od    The royal bed  Eurynomus  aspires  A Metaphor may be continu'd too far as well as carried too high a long Chain of them leads us away from the proper Sense and flings that into  Allegory  which we intend for  Reality strongly express'd  This is very common especially in our  Pindarick  Writers indeed few of our Poets but what have  See  Od    Verse to Verse to  See  Spectator  Numb  faln into it some time or other but in those you find the most gross and insufferable Instances of it that can be imagin'd  In these  strings  of Metaphor nothing in my Opinion is so faulty as that Point which has been so often touch'd upon the shifting of Circumstances in the same Description and representing a Thing confusedly sometimes in its  figurative  nd sometimes in its  proper  Appearance While an Actor is upon the Stage his  wn private Character must be wholly  aid aside he must be entirely  Booth  or  ntirely  Cato  Nay even in the Scenary  self things must be of a piece and  r  Addison  has the justest Occasion for  s frequent Severities upon this  c  contradictory  Mixture's prevailing so monstrously in our Theatre How would the Wits of King  Charles  's time have laugh'd to see  Nicolini  sailing in an open Boat upon a Sea of Past board What a field of Raillery would they have been let into had they been entertain'd with painted Dragons spitting Wildfire enchanted Chariots drawn by FlandersMares and  real Cascades  in  artificial Landskips  the making things after this manner partly real and partly imaginary is to join Inconsistencies Shadows ought never to be mixt with Realities in the same Piece whether in poetick Scenary or that o  the Stage  A Poet is never more apt to fall int  this Confusion than when he is speakin  of Allegorical Persons as particularly the Deities of the Heathens When  speak of them personally we are apt  mix something of their mystick Characte  this is certainly vicious in Writing a  'tis more so to confuse the Properties  those things over which any of th  Deities were suppos'd to preside wi  the Personal Acts of any particu  Deity  The Poets are allow'd the privile  of elevating every Subject they take i  the  r management if they please t  may represent the Sun as guided by an Intelligence and 'tis but one step farther with them to give that guiding Intelligence a Name they call him  Phoebus  and obviously enough feign to themselves that he drives round the World in a Chariot of Fire By degrees the Allegory is form'd regularly and enlarg'd with more Particulars he has so many Horses assign'd to his Chariot His own Appearance is well known Beardless and Young A Glory round his Head and a Quiver full of Arrows o'er his Shoulder  Thetis  is ready to receive him at the End of his Journey and when he is to set out again  Aurora  rises from the Ocean to open the  Gates of Heaven  that are kept for him by the  Hours  How very regular can Fiction be upon Occasion The establishment of this Allegory under these Particulars has prevented a world of Confusion this we may see by any Allegory which is not yet settled on some Uniform Plan To shew how far I shall beg leave to enlarge a little on one of the same Nature That of  Aurora  the Goddess of the Morning  Phoebus  is never represented on this Occasion but in his Chariot I was speaking  of As for  Aurora  I know not whether she rides sits or walks Sometimes she is in Heaven and sometimes upon Earth In short the Poets seem to leave it undetermin'd how when or for what time she makes her Appearance I have laid together several Passages relating to this but they leave the Point as confus'd as it was before  Now did the rosyfinger'd Morn arise  Od    And shed her sacred light along the skies  There she is plainly in Heaven  When o'er the Eastern lawn  In saffion robes the daughter of the dawn  Od    Advanc'd her rosy steps  And here as plainly upon Earth  With her orient wheels  Od    Aurora  flam'd above the Eastern hills  Here I cannot absolutely determine whether she be in Heaven or upon Earth but 'tis plain she is got into her Chariot now as she was pleas'd to Walk the time before  But when it is evident that she is not upon Earth 'tis still difficult to know  whether she is near it or in the higher Heavens whether she  Ascends the Court of  Jove  Il    Lifts up her light and opens day above  Or only  Il    Heaves her orient head above the waves  There is the same difference in the degrees of that Brightness which is attributed to her appearance sometimes she only  Il    blushes with newborn Day  and sometimes she is encompass'd with  Il    the full splendor of it  When I read one Description I take it for granted that the Glory round her Head should be of  a  Od    glimmering Light  but when we come to another 'tis of  a strong  Od    Flame  You are at the same loss to know whether her  Robes  are  Od    Rosecolour'd  Od    Saffron  or  Od    Purple  In fine It would puzzle the Criticks to answer directly whether she has a  Quiver  on her Shoulders and whether she is to appear in a  Compare  Od  with  martial or in a gentle peaceable Posture  This unsettledness in the present Case runs through almost all the Poets since  Homer  The most correct that ever wrote are not entirely free from it  Virgil  himse  f oftentimes  Aen  c  continues her Course so far that his  Thus  Donatus Ruaeus c  Commentators to salve the matter say we must understand  Phoebus  by  Aurora  In him the very  Horses  that draw her Chariot are  Aen  and  Rosecolour'd  as in  Theocritus  they are      Idyl    White  sometimes she has the  Aen    Horses of  Phoebus  sometimes  Aen    Four of her own sometimes  Aen    Two and sometimes she is forc'd to ride only and that upon  K    L  cophron  the Wings of  Pegasus  It may be left to the Poets themselves to determine whether this Management be just towards Persons of their own making I shall only say that the greatest Criticks have ever thought that  consistency  is requir'd in the most  unbounded Fictions  And if I mistake not greatly  Homer  is more regular in this very Fiction before us A Person better vers'd in his Writings than I have the Happiness to be might I believe form from them a  settled a Scheme in relation to this Goddes  as has been drawn up for any other of his Deities This is certain that he has precisely fixt the  time  of her appearance 'tis that  The Twilight is reckon'd into the Night  And the first  direct  appearance of  ays attributed to the Sun  ibid    Interval which commences after the first Dawn of Light and ends just before the actual Rising of the Sun She always ascends  Il  τ'  from the Sea to the Eastern  extremity  or as it is in the Language of Poetry the  See Mr  Pope's  Note on  Il    Gates of Heaven  there she sits in her  Od  ψ'    Golden Chariot which has two Horses assign'd to it distinct  See Note on  Od    from those of  Phoebus  and there she waits to    Il  β' c  prepare the way for the Chariot of that Deity  The Dress and the Epithets which  Homer  gives to this Imaginary Being are as they ought to be in all such Allegories  at the same time evidently  This  Eustathius  shews  large in his first Note on the second Book of the  dyssey particularly as to the Epithet    drawn from the Nature of the Thing and fairly applicable  o the Fictitious Person  So much for Allegory 'Tis a danger  us Topick and we are apt to be lost  in the Clouds of it Either the natural Description or the Allegory by it self may have a thousand Beauties but when they are dash'd together every thing is dark and confus'd They put me in mind  Philypsus  of the two Liquors Sir  Isaac Newton  speaks of which from a fine Azure and a beautiful Red if you mix them produce no Colour at all The transparence and glow which each had separately is immediately lost and their Beauties vanish away into one thick impenetrable Shade  Before these confus'd Allegories and mixt Metaphors I should have mention'd some other Instances in which single Metaphors are faulty either as they are Improper or Affected  Is it proper to speak of  Penelope's Wi  and Beauty  or her Beauty alone under the Notion of  O      Drooping Verdure  is i  proper to talk of  Od    Raining Kisses  or of  Od    and  Storing a Vessel with  prosperou  Gales  Is not th  Metaphor and the Turn  Expression somewhat affected or over  wrought in this Passage of the Nineteenth  Odyssey  These swarthy arms among the covert stores  Are seemlier hid my thoughtless youth they blame  Od    Imbrown'd with vapour of the smouldring flame  And a little farther in the same  My woes awak'd will violate your Ear  And to this gay censorious train appear  Od      O      A winyvapour melting in a Tear  Again upon  Telemachus  's return  All crowded round the family appears  With wild entrancement and exstatick tears  Swift from above descends the Royal Fair  Her beauteous cheeks the blush of  V  nus  wear  c  Chasten'd with coy  Diana  's pensive air  In the following Lines she hangs o'er him  In his embraces dies  c  Rains kisses on his neck his face his eyes  You have here says  Antiphaus  what  as appear'd to me as Blemishes in this  oem under these several Heads I have  ndeavour'd  Philypsus  to read it with  everity and when my Regards for the  uthor or the Influence which such  riters will always have over ones Soul  began at any time to sway my Mind I have call'd up all the Illnature I am Master of to my Assistance I'm fully sensible how difficult it is to keep the ballance steady sometimes our Admiration may warm us too much and sometimes a little Malice will prevail If any thing I have been saying seems discolour'd with this Temper of Mind point out my Faults to me dear  Philypsus  Correct me like a Friend and shew that openness I have deserv'd at your hands  When I have time to consider the Notes I see you have taken down answer'd  Philypsus  and to compare some Passages with the Original You shall know more of my Mind as yet I see no reason for your Request but think you have dealt with that Fairness which I so much admire in my  Antiphaus  In the mean time I have a word or two to add on those other Excellencies of this Translation which I mention'd to you before  That Method of Improving the Original by  Tran  ferring Beauties  from on  fine Writer to another is carried on thro' this remaining part of the Poem in the same frequency as it was us'd i  the former Volumes  These  Foreign Infusions  of Thought and Language to use the Name which Mr  Addison  has given them are very discernible to any one of a tolerable Taste 'tis true they must have something of a new Air but they still  a distinct Resemblance of the Old something like that of the Sister  N  eids  in  Ovid  Facies non omnibus una  c di  ersa t  m  n qual  m d  c  t  ss  s  rorum  In pointing out these Resemblances to some People I shou'd be apprehensive that they might think me taken up in an Imaginary Chase but any one of much less D  scernment than  Antiphaus  will perceive immediately that this Liken  ss is real and design'd by the Poet himself There is an  C  saubon  eminent Critick who has wrote a whole Treatise on this single Point in Praise of a  Persius  particular Favourite of his In the present Case Mr  Pope  tells  Preface to his Wo  ks Fol and Pref to the  storals p  us  That he read the Ancients with this Design that he serves himself of them as much as he can and that they have been his chief Inspirers in Poetry  I believe the Gentlemen  who are concern'd with him in this Translation would give me leave to say the same of them 'Tis too evident to be denied it appears both in their  See Note on  Odyssey      Observations and in their excellent Works  In these last Volumes how finely are  From Ss Book  ibid  B B c  V  rgil  B B B  Ibid  B B c  Homer  B B  Milton  B B  B c  Dryden  B B  i  id    some Thoughts wove into this Translation from the sacred Pages from the  Iliad  and  Aeneid  from  Dryden  and  Milton  among ourselves and from several others both Ancient and Modern  The Translator is sometimes as Artsul in adding of himself some short Strokes to what  Homer  has said We meet with several of these little Insertions which are very just and improving I shall mention but one As Mr  Addison  Sp  ctator  Numb  proposes a Correction of  Paradise Lost  by cutting off the two last Lines Mr  Pope  improves this Poem by adding a Line in the Conclusion of it This Insertion possibly is better chose than that  Alteration so modestly propos'd by Mr  Addison  The Reader indeed would willingly go off with some Hopes and Satisfaction after the Melancholly Scene in  Milton  's last Book but it may be said that considering the Moral and chief Design of that Poem Terror is the last Passion to be left upon the Mind of the Reader On the contrary the  Odyssey  ought on all Accounts to terminate  happily  and Mr  Pope  's Addition in the close of it is therefore an Improvement because it forwards the Moral it gives us a  So  Pallas  spoke the mandate from above  The King obey'd The Virginseed of  Jove  In  Mentor's  form confirm'd the full accord  And willing Nations knew their lawful Lord  Homer  himself does not end in so full and compl  at a manner His last Line does not rest well and  Chapman  seems resolv'd to shew the infirmness of it as much as he could possibly in his Translation which breaks off in these Lines  Twixt both parts the seed of  Jove  Athenian  Pallas  of all future love  A League compos'd and for her form took choice  Of  Mentor  's likeness both in limb and voice  fuller View and Confirmation of the  Happiness  of  Ulysses  and leaves it upon a firmer Foundation  In the beginning of the Evening  Antiphaus  You were speaking of the Poets  transposing Words  to Advantage I believe  this may sometimes be of greater Use in altering the Order of  Sentences  o  the Succession of some  Incidents  in the Poem tho' I own this must be attempted but rarely and with the greatest Caution Difficult as it is You will find a good Instance of the Former in one of the Suitors ridiculing Speeches and of the Latter in  Euryclea  's Transports  Euryclea  You know discovers  Ul  ss  by a Scar upon his Leg while she is Bathing him The Moment she makes this discovery she drops the Jarr of Water and is ready to faint away with Surprize and Joy Tho' these in the Nature of the Case must follow immediately upon one another  Homer  has inserted a long Story how the Scar wa  occasion'd  just after  the Discovery a  before  those Passions which are the i  mediate Effect of it Thus is a suddai  Event  declar'd  ourscore Lines before  is  describ'd  A Succession of  time  tak  up in the Narration contrary to t  time of the FactAn  Impetuous  Pa  kept in suspence in a word Two thin  inseparable in their Nature are  in the Description I know  whether I see this in a wrong Light b  t present it puts me in Mind of  fli  ging his Bason down travell  to Heaven seeing the Lord knows what there and returning again before the Water is run out  If I mistake not this Impropriety is avoided very Artfully  Euryclea  is not made to discover this Scar before that long Digression  Od  And and  It is rather said in the Prophetick manner of the Poets that she would soon Discover it than that she has actually Discover'd it 'Tis after the Digression that it is mention'd directly as Fact so that in the Translation This Fact is not disjointed from those Emotions which it immediately raises in  Euryclea  We are not told fourscore Lines after the Jarr is flung down that the Water is  running  out of it  If this be really the Case says  Antiphaus  I think the Alteration is much to be commended But why may not  Homer  himself be understood to speak in the Prophetick manner too for I suppose that single Point would salve all You do not blame the Digression itself  No says  Philypsus  'tis not the Digression which I blame but the Point in which it is introduc'd just between a Fact and what in Nature must be immediately consequent upon that Fact  If as you ask  Homer  speaks at first only in the Prophetick manner then it is all clear'd up But I fear his Expressions confine it directly to a thing  then done  and cannot be taken in the Prophetical way  Philypsus  was so engag'd to this Moment that he had not once observ'd how the Day wore away He was surpriz'd to find the Night was just coming on  Why did you suffer me says he to  Antiphaus  to keep you here so long I did not imagine the Night had been so near us You know I am an Eternal TalkerHowever I see the Coach is at the Door and we may reach our Lodgings I believe before it is quite dark  An ESSAY c  EVENING the FIFTH  _BEFORE they parted the last Evening the two Friends agreed that their next meeting shou'd be in the same place and as this was to be the last which they intended to set apart for this Enquiry they set out for  Horatio  's earlier than usual When they alighted  Philypsus  order'd his Servant before them to the  Dome  of  Apollo  with a Book or two he had brought in the Coach whilst He and  Antiphaus  walk'd on gently to enjoy the Freshness of the Air and the Beaut  es of the Place The Sun which now began to be in its decline as it shot thro' the Trees made a thousand wavering  Mixtures of Light and Shade The Birds on all sides were answering one another in their little natural Airs every thing look'd Fresh about 'em and every thing was Agreeable  Delighted with so many calm undisturb'd Pleasures they wander'd on from one Walk to another and chatted as they went of a Thousand indifferent Things Among the rest  Philypsus  fell into an Account of the Company he had to Dine with him You know  Morfori    says he  Perfectly well answer'd A  tiphaus  He was there too and made it his Business as usual to contradict every thing that was offer'd aga  nst any of our celebrated Poets  I am very glad says  Antiphaus  that I was not of the Company his way of arguing is t  General to be Answer'd and too Positive  be B  rn with  Yes says  Philypsus  it was his old way If one Person blamed some particular  Littleness  in  Milton  he wou'd immediately ask him how he cou'd blaspheme such a  Sublime  Poet and when another mention'd a gross Line from  Addison  's Works How absurd is that say  he to charge such a thing on the chaste  and most  correct  Compositions in th  World  Right and I suppose t  very next thing he must ask was How Yo  cou'd dislike such Glorious Men as  Addison  and  MiltonYou have him exactly It was in vain to tell him that you disliked only  this Line  or  that Thought  He would have h  s way and I doubt not but in his Opinion we are all a Set of Hereticks or at least Freethinkers in Poetry What an egregious Fault is it  Antiphaus  with some Men only to have ones Eyes open  But there are times  says  Antiphaus  assuming as he spoke the imperious air and manner of  Morforio there are times sure when they had better  e shut  And therefore I should wink always  Not so neither Your Betters  ay direct you what to look upon and what  ot  That's a good Thought truly  tis great Pity the Legislator has not consider'd of it I should be in Love with  n Act of Parliament about the  Use of EyesWhy where would be the great  arm of the Matter if you were order'd to  ink hard or to turn away from every disa  eeable Object that offer'd it self  How  ay I behave if the Object be agreeable  Look as long as you please  And How if there be a Mixture of disagree  ble in it  You suppose then that  here may be something disagreeable in that  hich is beautiful  Really Sir that  s my Notion Nay I am apt to think  farther that there is nothing so Beautiful as to be without Defect without some Mixture of the Disagreeable By your Rule then we must lose the sight of a Thousand fine Objects How can I look on that Lady you were admiring so much the other Day in the Ring without seeing that her Hair is of a disagreeable Colour Or must I swear that her  Eyebrows  are  Black  because she has a  fi  ShapeThat's overstraining the matter but I think you might pass by such a Trifle if it were only in Complaisance Where there are such exact Features  charming a Complexion and a Make so delicate 'tis barbarous not to let such a sma  Affair as the Colour of an Eyebrow esca  your Observation  Depend upon it I  would not be so blind as to think the Lady was Disagreeable on that Accou    B  t I cannot allow any thing disagr  able abou  her  Where are your Eye  then  I would not believe them  That's one way  Or what would  say to the new I  vention  What Invention I beseech you  Only of a  ett  Glasses which shall make each favouri  Object appear exactly the same to every E  And exactly beautiful  T  too  An hopeful project truly L  but  Morforio  be the Designer and so  things would appear all Glaring and Beautiful while all the rest I suppose only upon turning the Tube might be nothing but Deformity  In the midst of this roving sort of Talk they were got to the  Dome  before they thought of it  Well says  Philypsus  as he enter'd till I meet with the Perspectives you were talking of I shall not be asham'd to confess that I find my Eyes at present to be of a different Turn I cannot help perceiving some little Blemishes in our most delightful Poets and yet I am far from an Insensible to their Beauty I view them with delight I admire them passionately Nay I believe I have all of  Morforio  's Love except the Blindness of it 'Tis there that you have open'd my Eyes  Antiphaus  You have taught me to Love not only with Passion but with ReasonRather say reply'd  ntiphaus  that your own Mind asserted  s true Prerogative and rose up to guide  our Passions to none but proper Ob  cts  However that be says  Philypsus  am sensible of an Alteration for the bet  r and can now indulge a Passion for  y Writer with the greater Appetite  I am perswaded it gives the Mind a  fficient Pleasure without making so  great a Fool of it Do I not love thi  Writer added he taking up one of th  Pieces that lay before him I read hi  with the same Eagerness and find ne  Charms in him continually Nay  think my Love of him more secure tha  ever Since I can suffer my self to se  his Faults and by that means am satisfied that they can never be sufficien  in the least to cloud his Perfections  I am entirely of your Opinion say  Antiphaus  and doubt not but in ou  finishing this Enquiry we shall have th  greater Security in admiring Him  only speak of our selves There may b  many other Beauties and other Fault  visible to Men of better Eyes but w  may safely fix our own Sentiments o  what we have been able to discover ou  selves I hope we have endeavour'  sincerely to hold the Ballance steddy and when we have done what we can we have done what we ought  I wish you would have left that  Sentence  for me says  Philypsus  It woul  have serv'd admirably to introduce wha  I am to enter upon this EveningI  is at your service says  Antiphaus  an  therefore I beg you would proceed  Tho' I might begin very well with th  sententious manner  in Writing my Subject  says  Philypsus  is so various that I  o not well know what I ought to chuse  rst The Prospect widens rather too  uch upon me and indeed takes in  ost of the Faults and Vertues of any  oem I own that in general the Great  nd First Excellence of a  Poet  is to be  tural  but it will be allow'd me that  chief and distinguishing Beauty of  Epick  Poem as such is a true A  r of  reatness  and a Stile that carries  weight  d  emphasis  with it as the Vice most  pposite to it is  trifling vulgarity  and  anness  I wish I may manage these  oints as fully as I doubt not  Antiphaus  ill display the  natural  strokes that are  frequent in the  Odyssey  Sentences  carry much efficacy with  em in a Poem they are usually of the  erceptive kind tho' they seem rather  insinuate than to command As they  e general Truths and Maxims of Life  ell adapted to some particular occasion  the Poem they appear with Autho  ty and contain the most useful Instru  ions without the Stiffness and Odium  personal Advice  'Tis a Mistake  to use a Maxim of  ord Shaftsbury  's  to think that no body  ws how to take Advice the Fault is  few know how to give it  To do this  agreeably and at the same time with Weight is the great Art of Sentences in Poetry  Poetry in its Birth was calculated for the Service of Religion The design of the  Epick  Muse was to paint the Successes of Vertue or the Punishment o  Vice Hence the  Tragick  that follow'  the very same Purposes and afterwar  the old  Comedy  whose business lay in encouraging lesser Domestick Vertues an  ridiculing the Foibles of Mankind  S  …tire  the Offspring of both these pa  …takes of either kind she Smiles in  H  …race  looks Severe in  Persius  and Commanding in  Juvenal  The Satirist ma  se different Methods but whether  Lash  s or Ridicules 'tis still the  vici  who are to suffer  All the other Species of Poetry eit  all in with these or follow the sa  Ends such as forget this deserve  the Name of Poets they prostitute t  Muse and whatever they produce m  be of a BastardKind  Among many other Excellencies  ought particularly to be observ'd in H  …nour of the true genuine Poets of A  …quity that they seem to treat of Mo  …lity even better than those who profes  that Study Were it not for the Wo  of their Poets we might very well imagine  Benevolence  for Instance That which gives its Life and Spirit to the whole Family of Vertues was suppress'd  o the last Degree among the Heathens  n reading their Philosophers one is  lmost perswaded that they teach Re  enge and make it their business to li  it and restrain that Love which Men  ave naturally to one another In short  e that wants to find the true Philoso  hy must go to their Poets They break  ut into warmer Notions and more ex  lted Lessons of Humanity Among them  e Face of Charity is less veil'd and  ouded and Goodness appears with a  ountenance more generous and erect  The  Odyssey  as a  Moral Poem  exceeds  l the Writings of the Ancients it is  rpetual in forming the Manners and  tructing the Mind it sets off the Du  s of Life more fully as well as more  reeably than the  Academy  or  Lyceum  race  who was so well acquainted  th the Tenets of both has given  a  mer  's Poems the Preference to e    er  Quid sit pulchrum quid turpe qu  d u  ile quid non  nius ac melius Chrysippo Cran  o  e dicit  Ep  Surely  Antiphaus  Men were more Virtuous in the days of  Homer  than they were in the time of  Plato  or  Cicero  at least they were more charitable and tender to Strangers How else could the Poet speak in such a Spirit of Goodness whenever he touches upon this Duty Nothing is inculcated by him more frequently and nothing with greater Strength and Emphasis  Homer  in relation to  Strangers  does not stint the Charity of his Countrymen to the common  Use of Fire and Water  he seems rather to proportion the  bounty  to the  want  'Tis ours the Sons of sorrow to relieve  Od    Chear the sad heart nor let affliction gri  ve  He scarce looks upon this as  bounty  he rather thinks it a  debt  owing to every one of the same nature with us  'Tis what the happy to the unhappy owe  Od    'Tis what the Gods require  What is given to them says he is paid  o and will infallibly be rewarded by the Divine Power  By  Jove  the S  ranger and the Poor are sent  Od      And what to  those  we give to  Jove  is lent  As the neglect of this will be aveng'd by the same  To  Jove  their cause and their revenge belongs  Od    He wanders with them and he feels their  rongs  I doubt not but this Notion of the Gods wandering on Earth in a disguis'd manner was a very common motive to Charity in those times it is mention'd very strongly in the Original in this place and  Od    afterwards when  Ulysses  appears as a Suppliant among the  Phoeacians  Such high exalted Thoughts of this Duty have carried the Poet so far as  See  Od    to teach "That we shou'd not value any "labour of our own in assisting others" but as that is not deliver'd in the  Sententious manner  I shou'd go out of my way to repeat it at present  To us who have always enjoy'd so clear and steady a Light in regard to every branch of this Duty these  sentences  may appear common and obvious but I imagine any one who shou'd compare these Passages by the rules of Benevolence in the Philosophical writings of the Ancients would upon such a view allow  them to contain thoughts highly noble and extensive  I shall mention but one more which tho' it run thro' several lines is but one entire  sentence  and which by the way if I forget not contains a motive to Charity not to be found even in  De Officiis  p In beneficentiâ delectus esset dignitatis c  Cicero  's Catalogue  Who calls from distant nations to his own  The poor distinguish'd by their wants alone  Round the whole world are sought those men divine  Who publick Structures raise or who design  Those to whose Eyes the Gods their ways reveal  Or bless with salutary arts to heal  These states invite and mighty Kings admire  Wide as the Sun displays his vital fire  It is not so with Want How few that feed  Od    A Wretch unhappy merely for his need  I ought not to dissemble one thing That the Translation is not to be trusted entirely in this Argument we find these Passages improv'd in the Handling and those Lines in which they resemble our sacred Writings may be drawn more strongly However the Original it self may give us a great deal of reason to suppose either that  Homer  had borrow'd some lights from thence or that he cou'd discern the Light of Nature more  clearly than any other of the Heathen Writers  Before I compar'd Passages I must own to you that I was in particular expectation of Improvements from Mr  Pope  under this Article A virtuous generous Soul is certainly as necessary to constitute a Great Poet as a Great Orator and in Sentiments like these we may discover that temper of Mind which I dare say has contributed much towards making that Gentleman so good a Poet as well as so good a Friend  There is one particular more extremely frequent in  Homer  it runs thorough all his Works and is scarce once omitted where there is any occasion for it I believe your Thoughts outrun me and might prevent my saying that I mean His Reflections on the Miseries of this Life They are mostly very emphatical and lead to a very easy and useful inference  To his native land our charge resign'd  Heaven is his life to come and all the woes behind  Then must he suffer what the Fates ordain  For Fate has wove the thread of life with pain  Od    And Twins ev'n from the birth are Misery and Man  In another place we have the same Thought as strongly express'd tho'  branch'd out into several other Particulars Let us suppose  Ullysses  before us A Prince Great for the Ages in which he liv'd and greatly distress'd How much does he speak like one born to Wisdom and long instructed by Adversity  Of all that breaths or grov'ling treads on earth  Most vain is Man Calami  ous by birth  To day with power ela  e in strength he blooms  The haughty creature on that power presumes  Anon from Heav'n a sad reverse he feels  Untaught to bear  gainst Hea'vn the wretch rebels  For Man is changeful as his bliss or woe  Too high when prosp'rous when distress'd too low  There was a Day when with the scornful Great  I swell'd in pomp and arrogance of state  Proud of the pow'r that to high bi  th be  ongs  And us'd that pow'r to justify my wrongs  Then let not Man be proud but firm of mind  Bear the best humbly and the worst resign'd  Od    Be Dumb when Heaven  fflicts  Of all  Sentences  there are none which strike the Mind more forcibly than those which carry a bold air a certain nobleness of Thought with them There is a  Moral Heroism  greatly to be preferr'd to that which generally usurps its Name a Generosity of Soul that looks beyond the Vulgar and speaks up to the Truth of things It is this Generosity which animates those Lines in  Virgil  Est hic est animus lucis contemptor istum  Aen    Qui vi  d bene cred  t emi quo tendis ho  orem  The same Spirit is in  us'd into this Line  Od    Death illexchang'd for bondage and for pain  The noblest Sentiments are not such as make an  Eclat  but those which are  solidly generous and good  We have frequent instances of both from two Persons in the  Iliad Hector  speaks things that are  great Ajax  often what is  marvellous  and  surprizing  Both speak loftily but one is more solid and the other nearer to a Rant both shew Courage and Generosity in what they say but they seem to  talk  as they  act Ajax  fights merely for fighting sake while  Hector  engages always for the good of his Country  I shall beg leave to close this Head with two Sentiments as much celebrated as any in the  Iliad  and spoke by the two Heroes we have been talking of The one in the mere Spirit of an Hero  If  Greece  must perish we thy will obey  See Note on  Il    But let us perish in the face of day  The other in that of a Patriot too  Without a sign his sword the brave man draws  Il    And asks no omen but his country's cause  I am sorry says  Antiphaus  you have quitted this Point so soon methinks you might afford a little more room for a thing of such considerable Use  Sentences  are fitted by their Nature to carry on that Chief design of Poetry to mix the  Useful  with the  Agreeable  Together with a certain air of Authority they serve to establish the Poets Moral Character which according to a  Origin  of our Ideas of  Beauty  and  Virtue  late Hypothesis may render him at the same time more  delightful  as well as more  instructive  Besides this they often flatter the Vanity of the Reader And as the  See  Arist Rhet  Lib Cap  First of Criticks tells us  take the more readily with this or that Person as they confirm in general what he has before concluded from his own Observation on particular Occurrences in Life  I wonder at one thing says  Philypsus  That so many of the Criticks shou'd blame Sentences and look upon 'em as particularly unfit for Poems of the  Epick  Kind  See Note on  Od    Rapin  I think condemns them as they seem to jut out of the Structure of the Poem and are apt to interrupt the Narration too much  Bossu  who is rather on their side yet observes there is a kind of  Calm Wisdom  in them that is contrary to the  Passions  Even the Person whom you just now call'd the  First of Criticks  puts us in mind of your Rusticks that are always  Arist Rhet  ib Cap  stringing of Proverbs together and  very good Critick of our own says in  o many words that  Addison  's  Misc  vol p  they are generally  ome of the heaviest pieces in a whole Poem  Let them add if they please says  An  iphaus  that they sound aukwardly from  he mouth of a  Young Person  and prepo  erously from an  Atheist  I own the  harge the best Writers them  elves seem  o be sensible of it and where they do  ny thing of this kind are the first to  orrect themselves  Addison  Port  'Tis not in mortals to command success  ut we'll do more  Sempronius  We'll deserve it  emp  Curse on the stripling how he apes his  mbitiously sententious  Cato  Act    puts a  entence into the Mouth of  Portius  but  e corrects him for it in the next Line  ho' the Son of a  Cato  and when  Virgil  Aen    makes his Atheist sententious there is still a mixture of the Atheist to be discover'd in what he says  But grant that Sentences are not proper from Persons that are Young or Vicious Grant that they are not proper in a  Mezentius  or a  Portius  What then may they not be proper in  Cato  himself or in  Aeneas  'Tis the same Case in every particular you have produc'd from the Criticks they speak rather against the Abuse of this Ornament than against the Ornament itself There can be no doubt of it  Sentences  are certainly faulty when they appear too grossly and stand off from the rest of the Work But what is this to Sentences which are fitly applied and wove in Artfully with the other Parts  Homer  and  Virgil  are very happy in this particular they give them a sufficient Fulness but they never glare so as to attract the Eye singly to themselves  You admire them as much from their Relation to the things about them as for their own particular Beauty in short they might be Beautiful by themselves but they are much more so in the  Toutensemble  of the Piece  We may add to this that their Sentences are so far from hindering the Narration that they are almost constantly a part of it and help to carry it forward But tho' they are usually wrought into the Speeches of the Poem we do not receive them from Persons improper or hurried by any violent Passion and where the Subject is still and gentle that  alm Wisdom  that has been objected to them cannot be very prejudicial Indeed in any place or on any Occasion a long thread of them is insupportable these are worse than the  Sanchoisms  of  Cer  antes  because they are not so ridiculous We can laugh at  Sancho  all the time he is multiplying his Proverbs upon us but in Poetry such dry Preachments are of all other the greatest Opiates and have the quickest effect on the Audience  L  can  's Poem and  Seneca  's Tragedies notwithstanding all their Beauties are In  ances of this to a great degree  There is another way of murthering Sentences for which we are wholly o  lig'd to those ingenious Gentlemen the  ditors  It is that Art of cutting off  entences from the Body of a Work and  rcing them  to jut out  from it whether  ey will or no by Printing all such  hereever they can catch them in  Italick  Characters  Mr  Addison  if I remember is condemning this Practice in that very place where he says that  Sentences are some of the heaviest Pieces  in a Poem and I imagine nothing could make him speak so severely of them in general but this Practice that is so destructive of their Beauty  In short Sentences that are cold affected or illplaced such as are either too distinct or too much throng'd may be blam'd with a great deal of Justice but such as are handsomely wove into the Narration at proper Intervals and from none but proper Speakers will not only be safe from the Censure of the Criticks but are allowed by them in general to be highly serviceable towards g  ving its proper Weight and Emphas  to an  Epick  Poem  I think you have defended this Beaut  sufficiently says  Philypsus  and shall g  on to the next under this Head  Concise  ness  There is no greater Symptom  weakness in a Writer than his being a  to say  a little in a great deal  as nothi  is more strong and emphatical than  say  a great deal in a little  Hence the Force and Emphasis of th  Line of Mr  Pope  Od    Oh every sacred Name in one my Friend  And of this  Od    Od    The Great the Good your Father and your King  The want of a scrupulous Connexion draws things into a lesser Compass and adds the greater Spirit and Emotion  c  He shrieks he reels he falls  The more Rays are thus collected into  Point the more vigorous the Flame Hence there is yet greater  Emphasis  hen the Rout of an Army is shewn in  he same contracted manner As that  the th of the  V  Odyssey  which has  me resemblance to  Sallust  's Description  f the same thing agreeable to his usual  onciseness in these four Words only    Sequi fugere occidi capi  There may be a contraction of many  ircumstances to a Point which turns  ore on the  Sentiment  than the  Diction  s when we place the Success of a Thou  nd important Events on one Effort or  ne Moment of Time Thus  Antinous  e Bel Jug  Ed  Mattaire  the Chief of the Suitors to his Companions  Od    Arise or you for ever fall arise  Which has such an Air of  Milton  's  Lucifer  Awake Arise or be for ever faln  Those Lines says  Antiphaus  serve the purpose for which you repeat them very well but is there not something too much like a  Turn  upon the words in them I was sensible of that answer'd  Philypsus  but I follow your Example  Antiphaus  in viewing a thing only in one Light at a time to prevent the infinite Confusion that would happen in turning each Line every way This is brought as Emphatical You allow it to be so if it answer the end for which it is produced that is all that I intend and I beg once for all to be understood under this view in every Instance that I have or may use on particular Occasions  This masculine nervous Conciseness I am speaking of is very usual from Generals to their Soldiers but among a multitude of Instances I am particularly pleas'd with that Speech of  Henr  the  Great  before the Battle in the Plains of  Ivry  I am your King You are Frenchmen and there are the Enemy  Sometimes we find an Emphasis and Vigour impress'd on every particular word of a Sentence  Od    Now Grief thou all art mine  And in these Lines which we have often admired for their peculiar Strength and Efficacy They speak of  Ulysses  's extream Love of his native Country  To see the  smoak  from his lov'd palace rise  While the dear Isle in  distant  prospect lies  Od    With what  cont  ntment  would he  close his eyes  This is not only of use in the Grand or Pathetick there are excellent Instances of it from  Terence  Haec verba mehercule  un  falsa lachrumula  Quam  ocul  s t  rendo misere vix vi expresserit RestinguetEun  Act Sc  in the Tender and Familiar as there are others from  Virgil  in the Natural and even in the Satirical and that so strongly in the latter that  Thus  Dryden  from hisNon tu in  triviis indocte solebas Stridenti mis  rum stipula disperdere  carmen Ecl As others from this Line Qui Bavium  non odit amet tua carmina  Maevi ib  some have been apt to  imagine from them that  Virgil  might if he pleas'd have made the greatest  Satirist  that ever wrote  Sometimes this very Emphasis is encreas'd by a certain  Opposition  of the words us'd in it there is a Passage in the  Iliad  which I have particularly admir'd on this Account Give me leave to repeat it from the Original because the  Greek  Tongue is particularly Emphatical and has more Nerves than perhaps our Language is capable of    Ιλ χ The  Opposition  is carried on farther in the next Lines between        The Emphatical manner in writing flies all Dress and Ornament all superfluous and descriptive Epithets all turns and elegancies of Thought Hence that Conciseness which generally attends it The most obvious fault in Conciseness is Obscurity what is obscure can never be sufficiently emphatical This makes the concise way the most difficult of any 'Tis easy to follow the Stream of one's Imagination and write on with an unthinking Rapidity but to express every  thing fully and to say nothing that is needless requires a great Judgment and much force in our Expressions The great  Monsieur Pascal  had a particular happiness of comprizing  much  in a  few  Words he had a very Mathematical Turn of Thought and of all things hated an idle Prolixity You will be pleas'd with an Excuse of his in a certain Case where he had been guilty of it 'Tis in the close of one of his Letters where he begs his Friend to pardon the unusual length of it by saying  that he really had not time to make it shorter  Some emphatical Passages are not only so concise as to contain just as  many Ideas  as  Words  they have often force enough even to  intimate  several Ideas more than they  express  Thus it is in all Intimations of Power One of  Homer  's greatest Excellencies lies in this In setting off the Hero of his  Iliad  he does not say in Words that he was vastly Terrible to the Enemy he mentions the effects and leaves the Reader to collect what Terror must attend him After the Death of  Patroclus  the whole Army of the  Trojans  is put into Confusion only  σ'  at hearing his Voice  They are all trembling and dispirited  Ιλ σ'  they had seen Achilles  'Tis not a sudden Panick it continues upon them When they pour'd down in such Numbers from the City it was because  ib  π'  they did not behold the Crest of that Hero  and now they are all consulting whether they should not quit the Field because  σ'  he had shewn himself at a distance and might possibly enter into the next Engagement  Homer  has the same address in intimating the Power of his Deities when he introduces them as effecting their designs with a  Ιλ ν'  Touch  with a  ib  ξ  Voice  with a  ib  ο'  single Thought  It is the same Sentiment that gives their Air of Grandeur to these Lines  Od    Declare thy purpose for thy Will is Fate  Let a  l be Peace  He said and gave the nod  Od    That binds the Fates the Sanction of the God  And this of the same import from our  Shakespear  What he bids be done  Is  finish'd  with his bidding  On this turns the Greatness of that Thought in the Sacred History of the Creation  God said Let there be Light and there was Light  Tho' I should imagine this to exceed every Instance above because it  intimates  all that they  express  and intimates it as  fully  and  strongly  as they  express  it  Let the Greatness of this Sentence stand or fall by the Rules of Sublimity We need not mention that  Cap Ed  Ox  n    Longinus  chose it for an Instance of the  Sublime  whether that great Critick ever saw it or not is not material but I wonder that some later Writers of very great Name cannot be perswaded to see any Force or Energy in it I own I have never read what  Monsieur Le Clerc  offers against the Sublimity of this Passage Surely it would not be very difficult to answer it if it be of a Strain with what  See Preface to  B  ileau  's Works  Monsieur Huetius  offer'd before him Where he seems to argue that  See  Huetij Dem Ev  Prop Sect  This Passage cannot be  Sublime  because the Language is  Simple  It is this Art of leaving more for the Reader to collect than you express in Words which runs through several of  Ulysses  's Speeches both at the Court of  Alcinous  and before the  Suitors  Whether the Hero tells his own Story or feigns some other he is equally carefull in laying before them something of the High Station he once enjoy'd and hence his Speeches have generally a great Air of that celebrated Answer of  Marius  to a Message sent from the Roman General  Plutarch  's Life of  Marius  Go and tell  Sextilius  that you saw  Marius  itting among the Ruins of  Carthage  Intimation  is so strong and nervous that the  See  Quintil Instit  Lib  Cap and Lib Cap  Ancient Criticks confin'd the Name of  Emphasis  to this one Point tho' as we use the word the very contrary of this may be of great Service in making a Discourse  emphatical  The Soul is sometimes possess'd by the  Number  of great Circumstances Thus in that Passage of  Homer  which Mr  Pope  translates after the following manner  M  n Steeds  and  Chariots  shake the trembling ground  The  T  n  ult  thickens and the  Skies  resound  Victors  and  V  nquish'd  join promiscuous cries  Il    Triumphant  shou  s  and dying  groans  arise  We meet with the same  tumultuary Figure  in the Description of the Field after the Battle  Il    Thro'  Dust  thro'  Blood  o'er  Arms  and hills of  Slain  This Passage we are told is imitated by  Xenophon  and I am sure the Historian has not weaken'd it by drawing it into a greater length and expressing the Circumstances more fully Allow me the Satisfaction of reading it to you  Note on  Il      When the Battle was over one might behold thro' the whole extent of the Field the Ground dy'd Red with Blood the Bodies of Friends and Enemies stretch'd over each other the Shields pierc'd the Spears broken and the drawn Swords some scatter'd  n the Earth some plung'd in the Bodies of the Slain and some yet grasp'd in the Hands of the Soldiers  Now we have faln upon an Historian give me leave to observe one thing That both with Poets and in History  Minus est totum dicere quam omni    There may be some Fraud in saying only the bare Truth  In either 'tis not sufficient to tell us that  such a City  for Instance  was taken and r  vag'd with a gre  t deal of Inhumanity  There is a  Poetical  Falsity  if a strong Idea of each particular be not imprinted on the Mind and an  Historical  if some things are passed over only with a general mark of Infamy or Dislike It was in  Instit  Lib Cap  Quintilian  I first met with this Observation and I wish our Historians of all Parties did not give us so many Examples of it as we find every where in their Works  'Tis the same in Poetry when all the  Circumstances  are laid out in their proper Colours and make a compleat Piece its Images strike us with greater Energy than when the  Whole  of the thing is only mention'd in general Thus the  diffused Style  has its Propriety under this Head and makes a larger and more continu'd Impression as the force of its contrary Excellence a just and emphatical  Conciseness  may be more collected and pierce the deeper I do not mean when we  mention  a thing but when we  shew  it in a few words There are just Miniatures of Great Objects in Poetry as well as in Statuary or Painting A  Hercules  in little may have all the Nerves of a  Colossus  and even that prodigi  us Design of  To form Moun  A  h  s  into a Statue of  Alexander  the  Great  so desig  'd  as to hold a City in one hand and to have a River run thorough the other  Dinarchus  might not  have been more  Gigantick  than  Timanthes  His Picture of that Giant in Miniature  his  Polyphemus  Noble Images whether in a large or smaller Compass  rike the Mind very strongly Either must be according to the Occasion Things sometimes demand to be drawn at full Length and the Soul requires to expatiate over them Sometimes they chuse a more contracted Space But tho' they lose from their Size they lose no  hing of their Spirit It fills us with a  oble and enlarg'd Pleasure to consider  he Heavenly Bodies their Courses and  heir immense Distances at the same  me we are struck with a very parti  lar Admiration when we view their  tuation and Measures in the  Orrery  Any uncommon extensive Image causes  Enlargement of our Ideas and pos  ses the Mind more compleatly In  ch Cases 'tis observable that even  e Turn of the Verse may assist these  ages I may seem too particular if I  y that  large  Words and Lines which  nsist chiefly of  long  Syllables may be use to extend our Thoughts in con  ving any Gigantick form and yet  haps both will be found not unservice  e in Mr  Pope  's Description of his  Cyclops  A Giantshepherd here his flock maintains  Far from the rest he solitary reigns  In shelter thick of horrid shade reclin'd  And gloomy mischiefs labour in his mind  Od      A Form enormous  Or where we see him  b Ibid    Stretch'd forth in length o'er half the cavern'd Rock  Or when  He sends a dreadful groan the rocks around  Ibid    Thro' all their inmost winding caves resound  Whether you think this length and heaviness of the Syllables necessary in the present case or not I am sure you will allow it to be so in Melancholy Images  Where heavenlypensive Contemplation dwells  And evermusing Melancholy reigns  And a Thousand more  Homer  too in describing a large Object makes use of a word which of it+self is  Il    above half a Verse and  Ovid  on a like Occasion joins several together of an unusual length We behold his  Aegeon  bestriding his Whale even in  the Turn  Balaenarumque prementem Egeona suis immania terga lacertis  Met    of the Words which are to describe him  Delay  and  Repetition  are sometimes proper for the same Reasons There is a Delay almost in every Syllable where Mr  Pope  intimates the vast  size  of a Stone as well as the  difficulty  in heaving it up  Then heav'd the Goddess in her mighty hand  A stone the limit of the neighbouring land  b  There fixt from eldest times black craggy vast  Virgil  adds a Repetition in his Imitation of this very Passage in  Homer Saxum circumspicit ingens saxum anti  um ingens  And Mr  Pope  commends the Beauty of this Repetition as  See Note  ibid  it makes us dwell upon the Image and gives  s leisure to consider the Vastness of it  It may seem strange that the Vastness the  mere Bulk  of an Object shou'd possess the Mind in the manner I have been  peaking of but tho' there is no real Ex  ellence in Largeness 'tis certain that  e are apt to apprehend it as excellent This puts me in Mind of a Point that  lways strikes me very much in Poetry    Il    A sort of  Comprehension  as I should chuse to call it for want of some better Name 'Tis when any Great View is compleatly contracted into a few Lines but to come up perfectly to my Notion it should be such a View as is sufficient to fill the whole Mind We are in a manner surrounded with it on all sides and which ever way we turn our Eyes we cannot look out of i  This is the Case where  Ulysses  is represented in his Shipwrack on the Coast of  Phoeacia  Above  sharp Rocks forbid access  around  Od      Roar the wild Waves  beneath  is Sea profound  If you can fancy yourself in the Place of  Ulysses  at that Juncture you will apprehend what I mean the more fully You can then see nothing but what is painted out in this Couplet  I apprehend you says  Antiphaus  and indeed have observ'd this Beauty often in Reading There is a Thought if I mistake not repeated twice in the Eleventh  Odyssey  of this kind  Od  and    Above Below on Earth and in the Sky  I know not whether the Image be Total but it cannot want much of it in  that Description of a shipwreckt Person just before the Lines you repeated  Amidst the rocks he hears a hollow roar  Of murm'ring surges breaking on the shore  Nor peaceful port was there nor winding bay  To shield the vessel from the rolling sea  But cliffs and shaggy shores a dreadful sight  Od    All rough with rocks with foamy billows white  If this be not Total at least it will engross Two of your Senses whilst you keep in the same Posture but those as you say seem the most compleat which take up the Eye what ever way you turnAs this resum'd  Philypsus  to keep to the same Element  Od    And all above was sky and ocean all around  These Total Views are much more vigorous and affecting when the Objects are not inanimate or at least when some more moving Considerations are annext to them Thus in the Picture of a rough Sea terminating in craggy Shores and Rocks and a tempestuous Sky every Object has an additional Terror from our seeing  Ulysses  painted in the midst of these Dangers and struggling to make so difficult a ShoreI  remember a Passage of this kind in a Writer of a very strong Imagination which is heighten'd by the same Method We have it in a Description of Mount  Atlas  tho' I believe the Author took his Ideas from the  Alps  'tis deliver'd in this bold Poetical kind of Prose  Characteristicks  Vol  Pag  See with what trembling steps poor Mankind tread the narrow Brink of the deep Precipices from whence with giddy Horror they look down mistrusting even th  Ground which bears them whilst they hear the hollow sound of Torrents underneath and see the Ruin of the impending Rock with falling Trees which hang with their Roots upwards and seem to draw more Ruin after them  In these Cases our Passions as well as our Senses are engag'd and I take such Views to be then entirely compleat when all our Passions as well as all our Senses may be engross'd by them Were I to give an Instance of such a View I should prefer that Passage in  Virgil  where he places you in the midst of a City cover'd with the dismal shades of Night taken and fir'd in a Thousand places by the Enemy and every where fill'd with Ruin Terror and Confusion  Aen    Crudelis ubique  Luctus ubique Pavor plurima mortis imag    I have dwelt the longer on these  Comprehensive Views  as they fill and delight the Mind very strongly There is another Case much of this Nature and of particular Energy I do not mean when we  surround  but when we carry the Mind out to a vast  extent  As in this Sentiment  Od    By Heaven above by Hell beneath  There is a Thought of this Nature very justly reckon'd among the Sublime which appears with a perfect Uniformity in  Ingreditur{que} solo caput inter nubilacondit Ae    Lxx per  Grabe    Virgil  in  Homer  and in the  Book  of  Wisdom  formerly ascrib'd to  Solomon  For my part I do not at all wonder at this exact Resemblance in them It is such a Thought that when it is once set before one it possesses the Mind so strongly that it will leave its Image behind it And indeed 'tis obserable that a great Critick where he  wou'd applaud it in  Homer  T  De  Subl  θ' Edit  Oxon  repeats it himself in the very turn of his own Criticism  Longinus  is the Person I mean who in a thousand Instances as well as this  Essay on  Criticism  Is himself the great Sublime he draws  One of the most common Topicks for this among the Poets is in speaking of the distance of  Tartarus Homer  makes it as far from Hell to Earth downwards as it is upwards from Earth to Heaven It has been  Note on  Il    observ'd that Two of the best Poets since have enlarg'd it gradually  Virgil  to Twice and  Mil  on  to Thrice that Depth but if I mistake not  Hesiod  of old has carried the Mind further than either of them It wou'd please you to see how exact he is in his Measures  V  An Anvil says he will be Nine days compleat in falling from Heaven to our Earth and as many in falling from our Earth to  Tartarus  This is the Distance from us to the Gates of  Tartarus  only he afterwards carries the Mind much farther in this Description  There lye the Treasures of the stormy Deep  Of Earth and Water and extended Darkness  A dreadful Chasm squalid and uninform'd  And hateful even to Gods Whoe're within  The dreadful Opening of its Gates shou'd plunge  Prone thro' the great abyss twelve times the course  Of the Pale Moon should feel it  Storm and Tempest  In dire Descent still hurried on precipi  ate  Amidst the various Tumult and Confusion  Of disagreeing Natures Oft the Pow'rs  Immortal cast their Eyes upon these regions  Hesiod  's    And shudder at the Sight  This Imagination seems to be imitated in  Milton  where  Satan  meets with that violent shock in Travelling thro'  Chaos  but the Fall here strikes us more because it has no Bounds It is still continuing lower and lower and the Mind in endeavouring to conceive it is lost in its  desired Infinitude  When our Bodies are all so straiten'd and confin'd what must the Soul be made of  Antiphaus  and what might be its Powers if unrestrain'd Since even in such dull Company as the Body with all these Weights and Incumber  ents about it it betrays on every the  allest Occasion such an Appetite to  nfinity  Mr  Addison  in one of his finest Works  he Essay on the Pleasures of the Imagination  reckons  Greatness  as first among those things which give that  Spectator Numb    Pleasure  Nothing says he  Numb  gratifies  the Mind  so much as those large growing Ideas which lead her on almost to an Infinitude  Numb  Our Imagination loves to be fill'd with an Object or to grasp at any thing that is too big for its Capacity We are flung into a pleasing Astonishment at such unbounded Views and feel a delightful Stillness and Amazement in the Soul at the Apprehensions of them  Every one may know this Pleasure by Experience 'Tis not a dry Maxim laid down by the Philosophers Whoever will consult his own Mind when he looks only on a Prospect may say as much as Mr  Addison  or Mr  Locke  have on this Occasion When I had the Pleasure of Conversing with the Gentleman who design'd these Gardens as indeed the Finest in the Nation owe their Beauty to his Directions I was very much pleas'  with a Maxim which he then mention'd  That as the greatest  fault  in a Prospe  was Confinement So the  meanest  thin  too in a Design was to have th  Bounds and Restraint of it immediately visible  There may be several other Points to be consider'd under the Character of Emphatical whether from the  Strength  of the Language the  Nobleness  of the Sentiment or the  Greatness  and  Extent  of the Object itself but I am only giving a few Sketches of the Kind You will give me leave in the same manner to take a short View of its Contrary the  Low  or  Mean Stile  It has been said That  Eadem fere est ratio minuendi Nam  otidem sunt descendentibus quot ascendentibus gradus  Quintil Instit  Lib Cap  Lowness  as just as many Causes as Elevation since whatever raises the Sentiment or Diction has its Opposite which is Mean  This has the Appearance of Truth but if one general Measure must be giv'n I should think that it is an Excess either way which causes Meanness Things overwrought as well as things underwrought will be Mean  When the least Object is express'd in just and proper Terms it will not of itself come under the Character of Meanness Nay small things may be manag'd so as to change their Nature and to  compose the  Grand Air  We meet with Dissertations on the late Discoveries in the lesser World of Animals which have something Great and Sublime in them Littleness itself may be assistant too in Amplifying a Subject  Homer  uses it thus in his Character of  Tydeus  and 'tis visible to any one That bold Martial Atcheivments look greater in a  Nassa    than they wou'd in a  Maximin  Such Considerations as these have induc'd me to imagine That all Meanness arises from some  Disproportion  or other When a Person is represented in a View beneath himself or any Action of Force is express'd weakly the Expressions fall short of the Nature of the Thing Again that Meanness which arises from the Language may have the same Measure  The Close of a Sentence may fall beneat  the Expectance rais'd in the Beginnin  of it and then will necessarily have a mean Air Some sorts of Poetry are o  a nobler kind and Descriptions of things that would not be Mean in a  Sonnet  o  Satire  may become so in  Epick  In general all vulgar Terms and all ver  disagreeable Descriptions are beneat  the Heroick Stile as all Triflings o  any Affectation of Ornament argu  something beneath the Care of a Poet  who has taken upon him to rule the nobler Passions and to sing of Heroes and of Gods  When any thing has an Epithet higher than its own Nature and the Occasion requires or lower than the proper Idea of the thing might very well demand 'tis much the same in both there w  ll be a Disproportion and a Meanness Thus  e mindful of yourselves draw forth your Swords  Od    And to your Shafts obtend these    And this Line  Od      is Shoulder blade receiv'd th'  The same Critick who observes on a certain Writer for saying That some Persons who were Shipwreckt met with  n Unpleasant Death  is equally severe  n those who carry things too  ar he  anks any vain  c Elevations  and the  uerile Stile  under one and the same  ead  Indeed Both are frigid and Both are  ean A little or pretty Thought dress'd  p in grand Words is like the  C  pid  in  L  nginus  Cap  one of  Coypel  's Pieces who is crept into  Mars  's Armour and looks as if he was endeavouring to strut about in it Whilst a great Thought in little Words puts one in Mind of that tall Gentleman we saw one Night at the Masquerade dressed like an Infant and dangling its Hands as if it were perfectly helpless  A Mixture of  Mean  Language with the  Grand  makes the Meanness more visible as possibly in this Line  Od    Stript of his rags  He blaz'd out like a God  Thus where a Libation to the Gods i  c  l'd  Od        An Holy Beverage  in the  and  Mars  Il    the  Heavenly Homi  e  in the  Iliad  There seems to me to be something  oo mean for the Ide  we form of a Giant in this Expression  Od      Her  Antiphates  Husband  scowr'd  away  And just after  The Men like fish they stuck upon the flood  Od    And cram'd their  ilthy throats with hum  food  In the same manner we hear of  Ulysses  's Companions being  Od    dash'd like Dogs  by the  Cyclops  I doubt not this was express'd thus to give us the larger Idea of that  Monster  but might not it have been express'd so as to serve that purpose without giving us at the same time too low an Idea of the  Men  The Dignity of the Person will make any mean Language appear yet meaner Whether we consider  Ulysses  as  Od    so great an Hero  or as  the  Od      Godlike Guest  of  Alcinous  this Couplet sounds beneath his Character  Od    Shrunk with pining fa  t  My craving bowels still require repast  Nothing can be more just than  Horace  's Observation  De  Arte P  et    That a King in Exile or Dist  ess must lay aside that Air of Grandeur and those swelling Words which might  come him in his Power  Yet must he remember that he has been a King  here's a Greatne  s even in D  str  ss and a due Medium between Words  of a  ootandahalf Long  and  Monosyllable    Be that as it will there is certainly muc  Reason that he should reassume his Style with his Dignity and whatever may be said for that Speech of  Ulysses  in his Wanderings after he is reinstated he ought certainly to speak like a Monarch I am afraid he fails in this respect in the following Lines  e it my care by loans or martial toils  To throng my empty'd folds with gifts or spoils  But now I haste to bless  L  ertes  's eyes  Od    With sight of his  Ulysses  e're he dies  When the God of the Ocean sees  Ulysses  escap'd from his Dominion he is so much provok'd that he flies immediately to the Throne of  Jupiter  to lay his Complaints before the  Father  of the  Gods  Let us hear part of his Speech on this grand Occasion  Against  yo  destin'd head  in vain  I swore  And menac'd vengeance e're he reach'd the shore  Od    Behold him landed  careless and asleep  When an Expectation is rais'd by the preceding Verses and little or nothing follows upon this ExpectationWe need not quote  De  A  e Po    V  Horace  to prove that it will be  Mean  every one will see it  and every one may see that it arises from the Disproportion  I have often observ'd how fatal this Particular is to that sort of People who are known by the Character of  Storytellers  The greatest baulks these Gentlemen meet with are occasion'd by their bespeaking Attention too much and after all ending in some inconsiderable Circumstance There is a certain Passage in the  Odyssey  which puts me in Mind of this Disaster so common to them  Pr  pare then  said  T  lemachus  to know  Od    A Tale  from falshood free not free from woe  What follows upon this  No earthly thing I'gad  as Mr  Bays  has it only that he is  the Son of Ulysses  and that he is searching  after the King his F  ther  There is another  See  Od  to to  Instance of this Nature in that important Dialogue between  Neptune  and  Jupiter  just mention'd  Of this kind also is a certain Figure which Mr  Addison  Misc  Vol p  calls an  Anticlimax  A Downfall in the Close where a Passage has been very promising in the  Beginning I remember he quotes a  All  z vous luy ditil s  ns bruit chez vos parens  Ou vous avez laisse vo  re honneur  vos gans  ib  French  Couplet upon that Occasion which I suppose was design'd for Ridicule but there are many Instances of it from more serious Writers Such is what a Grave Doctor has said in his Character of your  Miltonick  Friend Mr  Philips  'tis deliver'd in this grand air of Prophecy Mr  Philips  's  Poems  says he  will last as long as Blenheim is remembred Or  D  s  on the  Classicks  p  Cyder drunk in  England  I beg leave to mention one thing says  Antiphaus  What You have been saying may afford the reason why that Species of Criticism which goes upon Ridicule in the  manner  of the  Hind  and  Panther  is not to be depended upon The best Lines that ever were wrote may be render'd Ridiculous only by raising too great an Expectation in the Reader just before they are introduc'd in the Criticism  There is another kind of Littleness proceeded  Philypsus  when the Language does not become the Poetick Stile all  Prosaick Poetry  or as Dr  Garth  us'd to call it  a Diction loytering into Prose  carries something of meanness with it something  below the Harmony the Emotion the Majesty that is requir'd from the  Epick  MuseHere are two or three Couplets which I think descend too near to Prose  And now  Telemachus  the first of all  Od    Observ'd  Eum  eu  entring in the Hall  Let  Eurymachus  receive my g  est  Od    Of nature courteous and by far the best  His food an herald bore and now they fed  Od    And now the rage of craving Hunger fl  d  It might be thought too trifling to observe that this Meanness is often owing to an illjudg'd use of Monosyllables  From  Vossius  de Carm  Cantu p  A Long Run of these little  Pigmy  Words beside an unavoidable Air of Meanness often makes a Line rough and hobling and almost ever keeps it from being firm and compact  'Tis very rare that you meet with a  Latin  Verse terminating in a single Monosyllable and sometimes where we do meet with it 'tis evidently  As in  Horace  's Art of Poetry V and  Virgil  's  Geo  g  V  design'd to assist in expressing the Littleness or Ridiculousness of the Subject  Unless it be thus design'd or be significant a Verse even an  Hemistick  may be render'd Mean merely by consisting of these little Words I know there are entire Lines of them that are tolerable nay that run with some degree of Vigour as this in the  Odyssey  Od    re yet he loos'd the Rage of War on  Troy  And that  Close  in  Shakespear  Cry'd Havock and  l  t s  p th  D  gs of War  The Sentiments here are so great that they take us off from observing the Littleness which the Dictio  might otherwise Occasion Yet to speak my Mind I believe that these very Thoughts wou'd appear more Majestically in large adequate Expressions  Beside this Littleness from the Nature of words there is oftentimes a Meanness annex'd in our Thoughts to such particular Words and Phrases All mere  Vulgar  ways of  peaking are mean in PoetryThe Muse shou'd reject any low  P  overbs  and the Language of the CroudEven the  Ideas  of things in which they particularly ar  employ'd  are  ullied and debas'dI believe I may add that whatever has an Air of  Burlesque  or has been markt for ridiculous on any other Occasion will be apt to retain something of the  Mean  whereever it is us'd  His Shoulder blade receiv'd th'ungentle shock  He stood and mov'd not like a marble rock  Od    But shook his thoughtful Head  I doubt not I have formerly met with something in  Burlesque  to which this Passage has a distant Resemblance tho' the thing itself be gone out of my head the distast to such a particular Expression still remains with me 'Tis true this wou'd not justify a Criticism and yet it leads one unavoidably to dislike the PassageThis sort of  Acquir'd Meanness  may be sometimes more general as where  Menelaus  calls  Telemachus  Od    The Mirror of constant Faith  This Expression has been so often us'd in a ridiculous  ort of Writings that it will sound mean to the generality of those that  ear it  A Starlight Evening and a Morning Fair  Is a Line in  Dryden  's  Virgil  Essay  on  G  rg  Pref p  condemn'd by a very exact Critick upon account of its being Low and Mean 'Tis of the acquir'd kind Any one who has been at all conversant with the Poetry of a Belman will certainly look upon it with something of Contempt Yet is there nothing Mean in it of itself and a Critick in  France  might think it a good handsome Line But the best Expressions degenerate when us'd by the Populace and applied to low things the use they make of them infects them with a low abject Air  Thus  Proverbial  Speeches and all other Expressions very common among us become unworthy of our Poetry Foreign Proverbs are often great and emphatical to us as many of ours may sound great to Foreigners yet at home both if vulgar will be apt to appear mean or at least unfit for Poetry One Instance or two will be sufficient in the  Tenth Odyssey  we have this Line  V  With  broken hearts  my sad companions stood  And this in the  d  V  Dogs Ye have had your Day  I shall not presume to say how far the  Odyssey  or  Iliad  might be blameable for any of these Meannesses in the Days of  Homer  himself it is the Priviledge of every dead Language to be entirely free from them at present We hear not the Proverbs nor know the current Ridicule of those Times His Language is safe enough from the Vulgar now And as to any Words that might be vulgar enough then to seem low we are in an entire ignorance This is a considerable Advantage which the Ancients have over every Living Writer and for which by the way there should be a large allowance made in any Comparison between an Ancient and a Modern  Thus any Meanness that is  acquir'd  may be  lost again  or  worn off  by Time and Accidents It is not so with Meanness in the Things themselves They have something settled in them and ar  deliver'd down to us thro' the Stream of Ages unalter'd and the same Perhaps if we would take off the Veil which Superstition has flung over the Worshippers of  Homer  we might discern some traces of this in the Conversation of the  Suitors  in the  Scene  at  Eum  us  's Lodge and in  Sicily  when we are with  the  Cyclops  'Tis true the  Odyssey  is built upon an humbler Plan  Homer  suits himself to his Design and it may be very justly said with Mr  Pope  Od  Vol p  "That where this Poem cannot support a Sublimity it always preserves a Dignity or at least a Propriety  If these Points may fail in  Dignity  they have always some  Propriet  in the Poem either from the Speaker or the Audience or the Occasion  To return to the Translation Every Idea that has something aukward in it has something mean and ri+diculous The first Laugh in the  Iliad  i  occasion'd by the aukward Behaviour and odd Address of  Vulcan  as the only Laugh in the  Aeneid  is rais'd on the un…toward figure which  Menaetes  makes i  that Poem  There seems to me to be somethin  Mean and Aukward in this Image  His  loose head  tottering as with wine opprest  Od    Obliquely drops and  nodding knocks  his brea  Perhaps the  Sneezingpiece  in the  Book  V  borders too much on the sam  Fault or if it be no Fault on the sam  Disagreeableness  For the same Reason all Descriptions that have any thing of the Nauseous in them might be avoided in Poetry or at least be but slightly touch'd in it I cannot think 'tis any particular niceness or effeminacy in my Temper which inclines me to wish that the Colours had not been laid on so strongly on some  See  Od  and c  Od    Aen      Addis  n  's  V Pag  Occasions The worst Image I know of this kind is in the description of the  Drunken Cyclops  and what is surprizing  o me the very same Grossness on the  ame Occasion is kept up in  b  several  f the best Poets that ever wroteHere  ou will forgive me if I am ready to  nk under Authority in a Point where  y very Senses almost contradict it  ut when such great Names as  Homer  irgil Pope  and  Add  son  may be produ  ed to defend one and the same Descip  on what are we to think  Antiphaus  an we say a thing is not offensive when  e feel the contrary or must we al  w that Nature ought to be justly and  lly express'd even in the most nause  s of Subjects  It cannot be deny'd answer'd  Anti  aus  after having turn'd the Question  for some time in his Mind every Description that is just is  poetically good  but then I fancy 'tis as true that a Description poetically good may be the more improper to be inserted on that very Account This will be readily allow'd in all Cases of Obscenity The  b  t Description  in such Points is certainly the most  improper  and surely the same will hold in a great Measure of any Images directly nauseous We have you say the Examples of the greatest Poets that ever wrote against us but i  the reason of the thing be against them  no Authority whatever nor any numbe  of Examples can be of the least rea  W  ght I am delighted with the Corre  tness of a  Virgil  or an  Addison  I ad  re  Pope  and reverence  Homer  Bu  were there any one piece of Obscenity  the Works of all these Great Men wou'  such a description alter its Nature an  become amiable 'Tis the same in othe  Cases as well as in Obscenities A  things that have something in the  nature Disagreeable will still be  agreeable whereever we find 'em  The Line you hint at in the  Drun  Cyclops  cannot but carry a very nauseo  Idea with it and had Mr  Pope  deviat  from the Original and dropt it in  English  I am perswaded most people wou'd have look'd upon it as a commendable Injury to his Author I remember  Il    a Passage of this Nature tho' less gross than this in the  Iliad  which Mr  Pope  has improv'd by concealing the Grossness of it and in the Note upon it he says  'tis unworthy of Homer he does not see any Colour to soften  he Meanness of it it must ever have been  oo nauseous to be describ'd  What fine Criticks should we make  ays  Philypsus  since we can be both so  eady to wish a Translator had err'd more  requently from his CopyBut  hatever those severe Gentlemen may  ink we should certainly have a large  arty on our side in the present Case  hat would they say to another Prin  ple That it may be necessary to de  ate from the  Words  of the Original to  eserve the  Sense  of it And yet this  ay happen As for Instance where  r Notions of things are directly conary to what was thought of them in  omer  's Days  Words are to be consider'd not as  nds  but as they are  Significant  and strict Translator should endeavour  chiefly to give us the same Ideas which the Writer he represents gave to his Readers It is on this Account I should take  O      The Monarch of the Swains  for Instance to be a juster Translation of  than the  Chief Swineherd  would have been In the present acceptation of things a  literal Translation  would have been a  Travesty  it would have made that ridiculous and mean which was not mean or ridiculous in the Original  Of old  Useful  Employments were also  Honourable  The chief Courtiers were Masters of the Flocks and of the Herds A Skill in Agriculture was reckon'd a very handsome part in the Character of a Monarch  Homer  See Note on  Od    places it upon a  evel with Military Science and looks upon the Reputation it deserves as equal to the Glory acquir'd by Atchievements in War  To preserve something of these  S  Od  and  Primitive Notions of things at least not to sink into those very low Ideas which we in the present world entertain of such sorts of Arts and Employments a Trans  ator of  Homer  is oblig'd to vary the  Expressions in common use for the same things Nothing wou'd be more ridiculous now than to call a  First Minister  by the Name of a  Hogherd  or to say of  Kings  that they overlook'd the  Dairy  There are some other Points relating to the  Manners  of Antiquity which may require some Alterations in the turn of expressing them I have been too tedious already Let me only mention one Particular of this kind and I have done  The Heroes of Old in rating each other are very free with the mutual Terms of  Dogs Cowards Villains  c In the  Odyssey  we have a Queen calling one of her Maids of Honour  an Impudent Bitch  and  Jupiter  if I mistake not pays exactly the same Compliment to his Royal Consort in the  Iliad  I think no one can dispute which is the better Translation in the former Case The  New  which makes  Penelope  call her Servant  Od    a Loquacious Insolent  or the Literal of  Hobbes  Bold Bitch said she I know what de  ds you've done  This is equally a misrepresentation of Fact and shocking in its very sound It offends the Ear and makes one s  artle  at the Behaviour of  Penelope  A Reader ought to think that Lady well bred This he cannot do at least he will be prejudic'd not to do so by hearing such Language now however decent it might be thought in those Times  I am oblig'd to you says  Antiphaus  perceiving that  Philypsus  stopt here for the fair account you have given of these Lownesses in an  Epick  Poem I know not whether your general rule of Meanness will hold in every Point that might be mention'd but in those you have produc'd it seems to square very well I imagine too there is one Particular of pretty large extent in this Question not yet touch'd uponThere may be several but you have all that I have observ'd says  Philypsus  I doubt not says  Antiphaus  you have observ'd the same thing and put it under some other Head You must know I wou'd rank all Thoughts which border on  Puerility  all  cold Fancies  all  forc'd Antitheses  and any mere  turns  and  sporting  upon words under the Class of Meannesses in an  Epick  PoemAs you have hinted such a Variety of Subjects says  Philypsus  will you not compleat the Favour and afford some Instances too under these Heads  What I can recollect reply'd  An  iphaus  is at your Service  Does not there seem to you to be something  Affected  and  Cold  in this Thought which I doubt not many will be apt to take for a pretty Clash in the Ideas  Here ceas'd he but indignant tears let fall  Od    Spoke  when he  Ceas'd    Such is this Thought  Od    And my tost limbs now  wearied  into  rest  Nothing is meaner than what is overwrought I own 'tis in Poetry as in Statuary Figures that are to be set up at such a height must be something larger than the Life but even then there are exact Rules of Propor  ion and nothing is to appear too Vast to the Eye  In giving ones Opinion of an exquisite Statue we may say it  lives  or  speaks  but when we go to refine on this we grow affected and mean Pardon me if I take this to be the Case in the las  Line of this Couplet  Alive each animated Frame appears  Od    And  still to live beyond the Power of Year  I was formerly pleas'd with the In  cription under a  Saint Bruno  in  Italy  but give it up now as carried too far it tells us as you may remember  Egli è vivo e parlerebbe se non osservasse la ragola del Silentio  That He is alive and wou'd speak were it not for the Rules of Silence he had establish'd  A Man must understand the History of the  Grand Chartreux  to take the meaning of this and after all it appears too forc'd and artificial  A Fault of this kind is the more evident when the Thoughts and Language look noble about it  There terrible in arms  Ulysses  stood  Od    And the dead Suitors  almost swam  in blood  You know a late excellent  Mr  Wollaston  Philosopher has endeavour'd to prove that no Action which disagrees with truth can be good and I shou'd not be new or singular in my Opinion were I to assert the same of any point in Poetry Every one knows the Dialogues of one of the most  Bouhours  penetrating Criticks in the last Age are wrote chiefly in this View He asserts constantly that no Thought can be good which is not Poetically  true and I imagine this that he asserts may be defended as easily in the  Fiction  of Poetry as in any of the plainest Passages But such an Enquiry wou'd take up more time  than Cr  ticism deserves and I mention it at present only as a Measure of such Thoughts as are  mean  from their being  false  i e  really beneath what they pretend to be  This Rule if just wou'd be of particular service in this kind of Pursuits I shall give you but one I  s  ance When  Circe  mentions  Ulysses  's descent to the Infernal Shades she adjoins this Reflection  O Sons of woe decreed by adverse Fates  Alive to pass thro' hells eternal Gates  All soon or late are doom'd that path to tread  Od    More  wretched  You  twice number'd  with the Dead  Do you not think this last Thought has something  Weak  and  Little  in it according to your general Rule it fails in its  Proportion  That Proportion I mean which every Thought should bear to  Truth  If it fails in that says  Philypsus  I must allow it to be Mean by my own Rule but I do not perceive in what respect that Sentiment is false  No says  Antiphaus  I beg you would consider the very Word on which the whole of the Reflection turns It has plainly too Significations widely different If their being  n  mber'd with the Dead  be taken in its strongest Sense 'tis certain this did not happen twice to  Ul  sses  and his Companions if in its weaker on this Occasion Their Calamity is put on a Level with something much more terrible and calamitous than it self  Or thus If this being  twice  number'd with the Dead be intended both in the same Sense the Sentence is directly false  if in very different unequal Senses 'tis fallacious and false in its Consequence  I beg pardon for putting on this grave face and affecting such an air of Demonstration but you must know this Though  is exactly the same in the Original o  if any thing rather more fallacious ther  than in the Translation in such a Cas  all ones Gravity is scarce sufficient an  the Superstitious perhaps wou'd rathe  disbelieve a real Demonstration tha  allow of any Fault in  Homer  I beg Pardon of them for thus assuming th  Chair of Criticism  as the noblest of  Lord  Bacon  De  A  gm Scient  Lib Cap  human Writers calls it and am very willing  to descend and act in an humbler Sphere  All sporting upon Words may seem unbecoming of the  Epick  Muse I shall leave you to determine how far there may be any suspicion of this in some particular Lines  Od    Thy last of Games unhappy has thou play'd  To me has some resemblance to the rebellious Angels in  Milton  where they run on in such a vein of insulting and punning I know not how far the Original might help in leading a Translator into the former Turn but here is another Line which runs into it without that wrong biass  Od    They on the future  banquet feast  their eyes  I should think this yet more improper on any grave or affecting Circumstance Do you remember the Death of  Antinous  in the  Odyssey  'Tis in the Instant of his lifting a Goblet of Wine to his Mouth  Wretch that he was of unprophetick Soul  High in his hand he rear'd the Golden Bowl  Ev'n then to drain it lengthen'd out his Breath  Od    Chang'd to the deep the bitter draught of Death  I fear that some Points which generally pass for Elegancies are of this kindA Case which touches all Readers of a little Taste very much is  Addison  's  M  sc  Vol p  when two very different Ideas are join'd to the same Verb  This is very frequent in  Cowley  and he has been often blamed for it as in that Instance  O    Up rose the  Sun  and  Saul  I know not how it is there is something agreeable in this management of Words but it is very apt to  njure the  Sense  A thinking  Malbranche  Search after Truth V p  French  Author lays down a Rule which is very useful towards discovering Fallacies in Reasoning It is this  To put the Definition instead of the Thing defin'd  I have often try'd something of this nature in Poetry If we make the Experiment in the pre  ent Case and insert the  enlarg'd Meaning  instead of the  particular Words  used by the Poet we shall generally find a Fallacy in this sort of Verse or at least a Lameness in the Sense of it  It will not be any great trouble to try this in one single Point The Poet  speaking of  Telemachus  's Voyage uses this Turn of Expression  To distant  Pylos  hapless is he gone  Od    To seek his Father's fate and find his own  This sounds very well but what is the meaning of the word  Fate  which is of such double Service upon this Occasion Try it in your own Mind  To distant Pylos hapless is he gone  To seek  whether his Father be dead or not  and find  What  There's no need of trying it says  Philypsus  I allow it to be d  ficient upon the first hearing But by the way I wonder you let the  Antithesis  in it escape so peaceably  Indeed I am no great Friend to them reply'd  Antiphaus  especially when they are multiplied upon us as in this Line  Od    Dust mounts  in  clouds  and  sweat d  s  nds  in  dews  I do not fear my  Philyp  us  should mistake me it would be too s  rupulous to discard every Antithesis out of Poetry as it seems affected to run into them very often Some are of Force and Emphasis  and some agreeable and engaging Possibly even  the Double Use of the same Word  is not absolutely to be rejected But however these Ornaments may obtain on some Occasions they  eem generally too little and artificial for the more noble Parts of Poetry They are of the  Ovidian  kind rather than of  Homer  and are more apt to hit the Taste of Schoolboys than of Men  And now I have mention'd  Ovid  's manner give me leave to say that in spite of his several Beauties and that peculiar Ease and Address with which he tells a Story I fear his Writings are one great Reason of the trifling Manner keeping its gr  und so much in the present Age  Ovid  is generally made use of to initiate our Youths in  Parnassus  We look upon him as soon as ever we open our Eyes to Poetry He is then 'tis true fit for our Taste but the misfortune is he is too Agreeable 'tis odds but this fondness grows up with us and a false taste of Wit drawn from him may inf  uence our Writings many Years after we have flung him from our Bosom The  Boyisms  of  Ovid  as Dr  Garth  calls 'em are agreeable enough to infect us to old Age Mr  Dryden  for Instance was thus infected by 'em  Ovid  and  Cowley  our  English Ovid  were his favourites at  Ten  Years old and his Corrupters at  Seventy  As great Genius's and more correct Writers than Mr  Dryden  may be touch'd with the same Infection I will give you an Instance or two of this with which a Person may be pleas'd even while he condemns 'em  Od    She to her present Lord laments him lost  And views that object which she wants the most  Again  His arms he stretch'd his arms the touch deceive  Od    Nor in the fond embrace embraces give  Any one the least acquainted with the Manner of the Poets will readily perceive this to be of the  Ovidian  kind It is pretty and agreeable as  Ovid  but to be so it loses something from the Air of  Homer  it sinks beneath that Simplicity and Nature which is the distinguishing Character of his Writings  Now you mention Mr  Dryden  and this sort of pretty Writing together give me leave says  Philypsus  to commend one sort of  Turns  which that Critick  Dryden  's Pref to  Juvenal  p  judges not only pretty but really good and substantial I will not defend all his Instances but I would engage to do it were they all as good as that from  gnoscenda quidem scirent si ignoscere man  Virgil  A very good Critick since has treated of this more distinctly His Notions as I remember are That a dextrous Turn upon Words is  pretty  The Turn upon the Thought  substantial  but the most  compleat  of all is when the Turn of the Words and of the Thought concur  B  ckwall  's  Introd  to the  Classick    p  When both our Reason an  our Ear are entertain'd with a noble Sentiment express'd vigorously and beautifull  finish'd  I should be glad to know you  Opinion  Antiphaus  how far a Person might admit these Turns in  Heroic  Poetry  As for the first says  Antiphaus  I believe one might venture to say that i  should be rejected universally I am s  little vers'd in these Particulars that cannot readily say any thing as to th  second the other whether justly or no  takes one very much I own for m  part that I imagine them not only bea  …tiful but useful I remember an Instan  of  G  org      one in  Virgil  which fixes the Images  very particularly on the Mind and it is this which helps to touch us in those Lines of Mr  Addison  which strike every one who reads them  The listning Soldier  ixt in sorrow stands  Loth to obey his Leaders just commands  The Leader grieves by generous pity sway'd  Addiso  Vol Pag    To see his just commands so well obey'd  If you ask my opinion in this Point rude and unsettled as it is I should think that no  Turns  should obtain in an  Epick  or any solemn Poem except such as have more Strength than Beauty That in lesser Pieces those may be allow'd which have more Beauty than Strength but that they can be justified in no Piece whatever unless they have some share of Strength as well as Beauty  The great Art of them is to appear Unartful as in these pretty Lines from Mr  Philips  's Pastorals  Fair is my Flock nor yet uncomely I  If liquid Fountains flatter not and why  Should liquid Fountains flatter us  yet shew  The bordering flowers less beauteous than they grow  As I take it The Beauty of this Passage is in a greater degree than its  Strength and the natural Air of the Sentiments is more exquisite than either The Turn of the Lines makes them observ'd by every Reader more than they would otherwise be and yet that very Turn does not seem to be design'd but rather to be the natural result of the Shepherd's Thoughts as he speaks them  If I have said too much  Philypsus  you must blame your self for it who led me from my chief Design I was just entering on the several Natural P  eces in the Poem before us  Some fanciful Writers afford us nothing but Pictures and Descriptions they continue Image after Image and put one in Mind of those  Americans  who when first they were discover'd are said to have us'd Painting instead of Writing  Homer  's Judgment will not allow him in any of his Works to be thus Perpetual in his Descriptions and the design of the  Odyssey  will not allow near the variety which he has very justly employ'd in the  Iliad  The  Odyssey  is a Poetical Treatise of Morality it does not admit of a profusion of Colours this is not to be look'd upon as a Defect we might with the same Reason blame a  Book of Maxims or  Plato  's Moral Dialogues for not having all the Flourishes and Charms of Rhetorick  And as the Plan of the  Odyssey  in general excludes that great variety of Description which abounds in some Poems the chief Scene in the remaining Part of it is so wholly Domestick that it scarce allows room for any thing of that Nature The Action now is confin'd it lies all between either the CountryHouse of  Eumaeus  and the Palace or this latter and the Gardens of  Laertes  What a narrow Scene is this for Description and yet these are the only  places  capable of any if you except a two days Journey and a short Voyage  n the  th  neither of which could be enlarg'd upon without injuring the main Design  Homer  was unacquainted with the modern Affluence of Painting whereever there may be any fine Object in the way As these Opportunities offer only in an Episode he passes them with the utmost dispatch we see his haste in the very Lines and indeed in every one of them distinctly  With speed the mast they rear with speed unbind  The spacious sheet and stretch it to the wind  Minerva  calls the ready gales obey  With rapid speed to whirl them o'er the sea  Crunus  they pass'd next  Chalcis  roll'd away  The silver  Phaea  's glittering rills they lo  t  Od    And skim'd along by  Eli  's sacred coast  It might be the indigence of his Subject this way which induc'd  Homer  to repeat the view of Hell in the  th  Book and the wanderings of  Ulysses  in the  d  But nothing could make him run into Descriptions on that Occasion We have the Names of Places repeated in Order and tho'  Penelope  has the ful  Relation the Reader is only tantaliz'  with hearing in general that  Od    H  images the rills and flow'ry vales  These things however they had been laid out wou'd have been only Sideviews For in the main Scene as i  now lies in  Ithaca  I think there are bu  four  Places  capable of Description If  am not mistaken in this it will give u  great Reason to admire the Managemen  of  Homer  who as he was too pruden  to run out into any impertinent Descriptions at that same time has not omitted any one of those places that migh  very well allow of a Description without wandring We have distinct draughts  of  Laertes  's Gardens  Od  V to  Eumaeus  's Lodge of  Od  and  the  Royal Palace  and the  Road  between these and the Palace These compleat the present Scene of the Poem and any one by laying them together may form an exact Picture of it in his Mind  Some of these have been mention'd already on other Occasions and the way from  Eumaeus  's House to the Metropolis deserves very well to be mention'd  ere I dare say you will think part of  t the most delightful Road you ever  ravell'd in your Life  Now pass'd the rugged Road they journey down  The cavern'd way descending to the Town  Where from the rock with liquid lapse distills  A limpid fount that spread in parting rills  s current thence to serve the city brings  An useful work adorn'd by ancient Kings  itus Ithacus Polyctor  there  n sculptur'd Stone immortaliz'd their care  n marble urns receiv'd it from above  And shaded with a green surrounding grove  Where silver Alders in high arches twin'd  Drink the cool stream and tremble to the wind  eneath sequester'd to the Nymphs is seen  A mossy Altar deep embower'd in green  Where constant Vows by travellers are made  Od  V to  And holy horrors solemnize the shade  There is a sort of melancholly Pleasure hangs upon the Mind whereever we have a View of  Laertes  in his Retirement The good Old Prince  Od    Labours thorough Life he  Od    longs to lay down the Burthen And when he is not so overcome with his Distress as to  Od    neglect his Employment in his Gardens he seems busy rather to  Od    avoid Pain than to enjoy Pleasure Thus is he engag'd with something of Diversion and much of Melancholly when the Scene changes to his Gardens  We have not a set Description o  these altogether but it begins at thi  Point and is carried on  Od  V  and  successively till we may easily form an Idea o  the whole  Tho'  Homer  has not wander'd int  any Descriptions of Places that lay ou  of this Scene of the Poem he has here and all along in the former part of it brought in short Draughts and Side views of things by such Arts as a  some of them necessary and all very allowable in Poetry  Such are all  descriptive Similies  Where in some Picture out of the Subject is borrow'd  to illustrate any Point that belongs to it This affords us several occasional Pieces and some of them very natural I have just dipt upon one of this sort 'Tis just after the Slaughter of the Suitors They are yet gasping and  Ulysses  is surveying their Bodies to see whe  her the Number be compleat  So when by hollow shores the fisher train  weep with their arching nets the hoary main  nd scarce the meshy toils the copious draught contain  ll naked of their Element and bare  he fishes pant and gasp in thinner air  Od    Wide o'er the sands are spread the stiffening prey  It's a known Remark that all Allu  ons of this kind drawn from calm Life  s Fishing Hunting and rural Affairs  ave a peculiar Beauty and 'tis as well  own that they acquire an additional  nergy when they are introduc'd amidst  y Confusion or to illustrate Images of  error  Virgil  Compare  Aen    δ'  has imitated this  rt of Contrast from a Similie in the  ad  which affords frequent Instances the same kind nor are they wanting the  See  Od  and the Note  re  Poem before us  The more concise and natural any Image the stronger the Illustration How do you approve of this on a number of Females employ'd at the Loom  Their busy fingers move  Od    Like Poplarleaves when  Zephyr  fans the grove  When these occasional Images hit i  several Points they are the more descriptive of the things which they ar  brought to Illustrate  Homer  gives u  an Idea of the Spirits in  Ades  of thei  still Posture their Motion their Confusion and the odd Noises they utte  all in one single Picture of this kind  Trembling the Spectres glide and plaintive ve  Thin hollow Screams along the deep descent  As in the cavern of some rifted Den  Where flock nocturnal Bats and Birds obscene  Cluster'd they hang till at some sudden shock  They move and murmurs run thro' all the rock  So cow'ring fled the sable heaps of ghosts  Od    And such a Scream fill'd all the dismal coasts  It seems not improper to point o  these distinct Likenesses as the Tra  …slation has done in the present Cas  more plainly than the Original th  same may be said of  S  e  Od    some other  This is done sometimes by insisting much on one Circumstance and  As in Mr  Pope  's  Iliad  V to Book  repeating it over and over  Borrow'd Images appear with a particular Propriety and Grace when they have some near Relation to the Scene on which the Poem turns at the very Instant of applying 'em Thus in the  Battle of Rivers  in the  b Iliad  every Similie is  quatick and adapted to the Place Thus if the Swiftness of a Deity passing  'er the  Land  is to be illustrated in this  anner  Homer  images it by the Swift  ess of an  Eagle  but when  Mercury  is  ying over the  Sea  by that of some  Od    aterfowl  The Image of an Angler is us'd in  e  Iliad  of a person in the Field of Bat  e in the  Od    Odyssey  of persons at Sea  oth on Occasions which make that  age proper But it seems more pro  er in the latter from the Agreement  Place In this and all like Cases  rt of the Picture is nearer to us and  ill be conceiv'd the more readily and early  There may also be some propriety  om any previous Relation between the  Person  and the  Thing  to which he is compar'd Any faithless wavering Creature may be compar'd to the Sea but it strikes one more when  Venus  is said to be as  Guarini  's  Pastor Fido  Att Sc  Inconstant as the Waves from whence she sprung  Any rough Man may be compar'd to the Element in another view but there is a peculiar fitness in these Lines  A r  ce of rugged Mariners are these  O    Unpolish'd Men and boist'rous as their Seas  I remember I us'd formerly to be mightily taken with a Similie in the  Cui saepe suis in montibus hirc  Prolixam invidit barbamDe  CambroBri  Thus  Virgil  's Abietibus juvenes patriis montibus aequos  M  scipula  and I believe now it was  n this very Account Ideas which  ave been alreaded join'd on any other Occasion will agree the more easily on a new one  The Picture is less broken also when the borrow'd Image is adapted to the present Circumstances Where  Penelop  is represented as chast and beautiful 'tis said she look'd  Od    like  Diana  with all the Charms of  Venus  when her Beauty is the chief Circumstance to be  insisted on she is compar'd to  Od    Venus  without any mention of  Diana  We may observe by the way that the Heathen Poets in comparing a Person to any of their Deities had a sure Method of giving their Readers a Picture of that Person The Statues of their Deities were known by every one and the Faces of each as well ascertain'd as the Faces of the  Roman  Emperors for instance can be by frequently conversing with their Medals This I take to be one Reason why this sort of Comparison is so very frequent in the Ancients The Case is very different in any modern Composition tho' we seem to be equally fond of the same Comparisons  If it does not add to the Strength at least it makes the Piece more agreeable when these Images are unusual Thus  Ulysses  in his Bed of Leaves to a  Od    Coal of Fire preserv'd in the Embers and before in his raft at Sea to an  Ibid    heap of Thorns driven by the Wind  There may be a  Prettiness  as well as a  Likeness  in these Images I always us'd to be pleas'd with that Passage where  Penelope  is compar'd to a  Od    Nightingale  tho' I am more pleas'd with the same Image in  Georg    Virgil  which beside its agreeableness is perhaps the most compleat Instance that can be given of such Similitudes as hit exactly in every Point  Virgil  certainly excells  Homer  in these as we may say that  Homer  excells him in the  Vague Similitude  for both have their distinct Beauties  'Tis the proper air of Poetry to be unconfin'd and free The Muse loves a flowing Dress Her motions are ever Easy and her very ornaments must be Natural Such is the Muse of  Homer  And hence the Poet in this sort of  Pictures does not in the least Scruple  to take in several Circumstances that do  not affect the main Resemblance When  a Painter is copying a Piece he must preserve the Likeness but he may var  in the Drapery the Posture the Under  figures and the Scene around 'em  Thus in  Homer  's  Philomel  the main Likeness is very well taken When the Poet has secur'd this he touches upon the History of  Itylus  and launches out into Particulars which are  Od  τ'  so far  from squaring with the Case of  Penelope  that they have no manner of Relation to it  Homer  is almost singular in another sort of Similie the Reverse of the former when the Principal Figures have in themselves no Likeness but agree in some one Circumstance of Action These are very frequent in the  Iliad  and  Odyssey  and I cannot say whether it be from a true Judgment or a scrupulous Niceness that later Writers endeavour to imitate them but very rarely  Perhaps this is blameable and so may be that stringing of several Similies together which we sometimes meet with in  Homer  I do not mean when several things are chosen to illustrate the  See Ιλ ξ  same Point  more fully but when Similies on  different  things follow too close on the Neck of one another In the  d Iliad    to  we have one of these strings which takes up thirty Lines And tho' they are all excellently well chosen and have one common Point of Union between  they may seem something faulty as they are too numerous for the  lace in which they stand and too much crouded on one another  Now I have digress'd so far on two or three Vices in ancient Similies I shall just mention one or two of a later  Date Such is the  continued  Similie which is very liable to the great Fault of mixt Metaphors when a Writer to lengthen a  comparison  carries it beyond the  Likeness  I remember one of Mr  Dryden  's in a  Before his Translation of the  Georgicks  Dedication that begins very well  The Greatness of Birth shews a Nobleman with advantage but if he degenerates  the least Spot is visible on Ermine  This does not seem to be continued so happily as it is begun  To preserve this Whiteness in its Original Purity You my Lord have  like that Ermine forsaken that common tract of Business which is not always clean  The Art of extracting Similies out of a thing directly contrary to your purpose is I think wholly Modern Every one knows an Instance of this in that famous Doctor who to illustrate the  Danger  of the  Church  compares it to one of the  Prophets who was encompass'd with  emen and Chariots of Fire  for his  fence  Nothing is so opposite to the Design of this Beauty in Poetry as to labour after a vast Number of Likenesses in any the minutest Points and to multiply  them rather to shew how far the Poets Wit can carry the Resemblance than to strengthen the Image of the things describ'd This descends even to playing upon Words nay sometime to particularize several Points in which they are  unlike  as well as those in which they  agree  This is the  Cowlean  Similitude and I could produce  See a  Pindarick Ode  on  Cowley  in  Dryden  's  Misc  Vol particularly the whole third  Stanza  monstrous Instances of it from a very fine Writer where he endeavours only to imitate  Cowley  at a Distance 'Tis the same Person who has introduced Similies into his  Prose  in a manner unknown to the Ancients but he who would blame any of his Writings of  this kind  must blame them as Mr  Locke  does Eloquence with the Tenderness of a Lover  It is not difficult to judge of any Similie Ancient or Modern Their  Ad inferendam rebus lucem  repertae sunt  SimilitudinesPraecipuè custodiendum ne id quod Similitudinis gratiâ adscivimus aut obscurum sit  ut igno  um  Quintil Instit  Lib Cap  chief Design is to make things clear Obscurity and Confusion is their great Fault Poetry may go much farther in them than Prose but even in Poetry none can be good which do not give us  either more distinct larger Notions of the thing or at least of some Circumstance of the thing  to be describ'd  I long to add several things on this Head but I have wander'd too far already from our chief Design it is time now to consider a higher Class of Descriptions and Images which we touch'd upon when we were talking over the former Books of the  Odyssey  that Poetical power of expressing the  Passions  and even  Ideas  yet in the Minds of Men  I am not angry with You  Philypsus  for preventing much of what might have been offer'd here when you were considering the Starts and Turns which our Passions occasion in the various manners of Speaking I know not how such a Notion would appear to the World but you have thoroughly perswaded me that all the Figures of Speech of the  Figures either belong to the  Diction  or the  S  ntiment  the latter is what is here intended  Nobler Order are view'd in a truer Light when we look upon them as naturally Expressive of what we feel within us than when we consider them only as the Arts and Machineries of Writing  It was on this Occasion you went thorough the most passionate Scenes in  the  Odyssey  for such are the several Enterviews in which  Ulysses  makes himself known to his  Book  Friends his  B  Son his  B  Father and his  B  Consort  Penelope  's  Od    Speech at that juncture is excellent and indeed all her Speeches in general are of the  Pathetick  kind and under this view afford us the most beautiful Passages in the whole Poem  To the many things that have been said on the  Double Passions  as you were pleas'd to let me call them give me leave to add one particular Case more what I mean is  Dissimulation  We have frequent Descriptions of this in the  Odyssey  Every Instance of it if passionate at all will fall under this Consideration and that in the highest Degree as the Passion  assum'd  and the  real  are direct Opposites Every one who only pretends to  Courage  is certainly affected with  Fear  and when we put on a false Gayety the  Heart  is as dull and oppress'd as the  Countenance  is enliven'd  Could we look into the Breast of one who affects a Liveliness when his Thoughts are really Gloomy we should see his Spirits in such contrary Emotions  as are describ'd in the Suitors under those unaccountable mixt fits of Mirth and Heaviness  Od    Pallas  clouds with intellectual gloom  The Suitors Souls insensate of their doom  A Mir  hful phrenzy seiz'd the fated croud  The Roofs resound with caus  less laughter loud  Then down each cheek the tears spontaneous flow  Such is that  Od    Smile of Penelope  which has something very uneasy in it She seems all the while to struggle with her Tears 'Tis like a transient Gleam of Light when the Heavens are overcast all around is Gloomy and the Light itself is Dim and Waterish  This perhaps is an Instance not of the affected but the natural Kind 'Tis true one Passion sometimes usurps the Effect of another Without tumbling over  DesCartes  for a Solution of the matter we know that an Excess of  Joy  often breaks out into  Tears  and that  Rage  may vent itself in a  Smile  These indeed are contrary Appearances but 'tis very different in all Points of Dissimulation The Mixture then has something peculiar in it Contrary to the natural Blending of such Emotions this  has always an Air forc'd and artificial The Soul was not made to be a Counterfeit every time we wou'd teach her these new Arts we fling her off her Biass and give her an unnatural Motion There will ever be something aukward in the Passions of the most profound Dissemblers  Only view  Ulysses  when he is struck to the Soul with the Affection and Tears of his  Penelope  and at the same time resolv'd to conceal those his Emotions from her as much as possible  Od    Withering at heart to see the weeping fair  His eyes look stern and cast a gloomy stare  Of horn the stiff relentless balls appear  Or globes of iron fixt in either Sphere  Firm wisdom interdicts the soft'ning tear  Even  Ulysses  that  Ulysses  who is so  See Note  ibid  Celebrated among the Ancients for his Command over his Passions does not appear without something forc'd and unnatural in his Looks amidst all his Dissimulation He can command his Tears he can command his Tongue but still his very Features would betray him  I know not what to say to one thing That  Homer  makes Dissimulation one of  the greatest Excellencies of his Hero The Heathen system of Morality was incompleat enough to bear with this proceeding and even Christians of the greatest Name have border'd much on the same Notions One of our Ancient Writers who was as capable as any of them to do it has  See  Chrysostom  Tom pag Ed  Savil  c  launch'd out into a long defence of  useful Frauds  and  Father Paul  to mention one not inferior among the Moderns reckons Dissimulation  Where the Historian says that  Pope  died  Con allegrezza non mediocre della cor  e  a quale ben ammirava le  vertu  di quello che erano una gravita naturale et essemplare parsimonia  dissimulation    odiava pero maggio  mente l' avaria  ia durezza crudelta  Hist  del  Concilio Trid  p  expressly among the  Vertues  of  Pope Clement  the  Seventh  I do not mention this as any Argument for the thing but to extenuate the Proceeding of  Homer  'Tis no wonder that he should mistake a counterfeit Virtue in the Dark which such great Men could not distinguish in the Light  But whatever Colour Dissimulation may bear in the Schemes of Morality it is certainly a great Excellence to paint  Dissimulation well in Poetry The pretended Passion must appear most strongly and yet the real Passion must appear under it It must be like the Drapery in Pictures which shews the turn of the Limbs at the same time that it hides them and in particular puts one in Mind of that Veil in  Homer which seems and only seems  to shade the Face of  Penelope  There is nothing more difficult in Poetry than to express justly Ideas in the Minds of Persons whom we describe But tho' this be the least obvious 'tis perhaps the most agreeable of all Studies The Poet must search carefully into the Nature of Ma  and the Working of his Thoughts in general He must know what Emotions are natural on each Accident of Life and on every single Occasion is to consider not only the Circumstances of Actions but also the Temper the Education and the very  make  of the Person concern'd in them These will alter Men's Views of the very same Point When  Nestor  talks of Atchievements in War he will dwell chiefly upon the Prudence and Experience of a General  Hector  will mention the great effects of Strength and Courage  T  deus  must place the whole on a bold daring Spirit without taking the Body into the  Account while  Polypheme  on the contrary must speak of nothing but the Advantage of a vast Size and superior Strength  A Man's Notions of Excellence are form'd generally from some advanc'd Powers of his own Each Man is apt to make himself the Measure of all the Species and his Species the Standard of all Perfection All Beings above him must be exactly like the superior Moyety of his own Being and all below him must be purely of the Inferior The Vulgar of Mankind form their Heaven hereafter out of those things which have pleas'd them most in Life and the very Notions of the Deity in most Men take a Turn from their own Complexions The God of proud  tyrannical  Minds is a Being that delights only in the  Glory of being Terrible  as with the soft and pitiful The Deity is  all Mercy  the Gods of  Epicurus  were mere pleasurable Intelligences and the Deities of the  Irroquois  are  Mighty Hunters  Commend me to that Philosopher who said that  were his Horse to give us his Notion in this Case A Broad Chest and a Flowing Mane would certainly be the Principal things in it  One cannot easily apprehend how general an effect this has in the Actings of  our Minds I know not that it is yet designedly manag'd in any System of Philosophy for Mr  Locke  's  Association  of  Ideas  seems to be something very distinct from it and as it wants a Name give me leave to call it for the present The  Assimilation of Ideas  If you would save me from a Fit of Philosophizing be so good as to reach that Volume of the  Odyssey  just by you That I may read you a Passage which took with me particularly on this Account 'Tis where  Ulysses  has acquainted the  Cyclops  with his real Name and Character this is part of the Monster's Answer  Oh Heavens oh Faith of ancient Prophecies  This  Telemus Eurymides  foretold  Long since he menac'd such was Heavens command  And nam'd  Ulysses  as the destin'd hand  I deem'd some Godlike Giant  to be hold  O  lofty Hero haughty brave and bold  Not this weak Pigmy wretch of mean Design  Od    Who not by Strength subdu'd me but by Wine  Even the Excellence of those things with which we converse chiefly is apt to influence our Thoughts in the same manner Hence the Eastern Writers Image the Height and Stateliness of any  illustrious Person by  Cedars Homer  by the  Od  ζ'    DelianPalmtree  and  Virgil  by what a  British  Reader will think the most Noble a  Aen  and    large Lofty Oak  There's a Passage which I remember I was mightily pleas'd with formerly in reading  Cervantes  without seeing any Reason for it at that Time tho' I now imagine that which took me in it comes under this View Speaking of  Don Quixot  the first time that Adventurer came in sight of the Ocean he expresses his Sentiments on this Occasion in the following manner  He saw the Sea which he had never seen before and thought it much bigger than the River at  Salamanca  This Turn of Thought is not so commonly observ'd perhaps as it might easily be in Life There are other occasional  Traces  in the Mind which are known and obvious Things that are common in some Degree to all Men and such are all those Apprehensions which follow from any  MasterPassion  One might expat  ate here very Agreeably on each of them but I am ever apt to be too Tedious and will therefore confine my self to one single Passion that of  Fear  We may see in the Descriptions of the Poets how this Passion acts on the Soul through all its different Degrees from a  Wavering  and  Irresolution  of Mind to the Excess of  Confusion  and  Despair  When a Coward as most Cowards are Vainglorious undertakes any Enterprize of Difficulty the Moment he is engag'd in it his Mind turns all upon the Danger of the Undertaking He immediately wishes himself fairly out of it His Body begins to tremble and his Thoughts are all confus'd and irresolute Thus it is with  Dolon  That Wretch engages under the Covert of the Night to steal to the Camp of the  Greeks  and discover their Motions Before he is got half way The first tread of Men that he hears  He hoped in his Mind  says  Ιλ χ'  Homer that 'twas a Messenger from  Hector  to recall him  The whole Book where we have this Image is nothing but one Picture of Fear in different Postures The apprehensions of distant Danger are very naturally express'd in the  Grecian  Guard  Cautious of surprize  Each Voice each Motion draw their ears and eyes  Il      Each Step of passing feet increas'd th'affright  This Description seems to have been improv'd beyond the Original from  Vastos a rupe Cyclopas Prospicio sonitum{que} pedum vocem{que} tremisco  Aen    Virgil  's  Achemaenides  Any near Danger has more visible Effects The Motions of a Person thus affected are  Ex oculis se turbidus abstulit  Ae    Tum pectore sensus  Vertuntur varii Rutulos aspectat urbem  Cunctatur{que}  met  telum{que}  instare tremiscit    broken and disorder'd his Colour comes and goes His Eyes are  Tum primum nostri Cacum videre timentem  Turbatumque  oculis  disturb'd he cannot bear to look        full on the Face of his Enemy he approaches faintly and winks even when he strikes  Fear has another strange Property of  Magnifying  our Ideas of the Danger When we are possess'd with it we are apt like  Sosia  in the Play to take every Shadow for a Man and every Man for a Giant If the Danger be present we think it greater than it is and to its real Terrors add a Thousand that are only imaginary Thus the Suitors view  Ulysses  when he is ready to revenge himself upon them their Fears  Od  to  aggravate every Fierceness of his Actions they look upon him as more than human as an incens'd destructive Deity  If I mistake not there's a certain great Writer who calls Fear  A natural Inebriation of the Mind  it shews every thing Double I know not what the  Mythologists  may teach But this in my Opinion might account for the Multiplicity of  Cerberus  's Heads and all the Hands of  Briareus  There is something very Expressive in a Thought of  Virgil  's if we might take it under this View  Se Turni media inter millia vidit  Aen    Hinc  cies  atque  hin  acies  astare Latinas  This spreading of any Danger in our Ideas may widen so far as to possess the whole Mind Then it is that it takes away all  Od    Power of Action even  Od      of Flight it fixes  Subitus tremor occupat artus  Diriguere oc  i  tot Erinnys sibilat hydris  Tantaque se facies  aperitAen    the Eye entirely  in one horrid Stare and even  cΙλ θ' See Note on  Odyssey    shuts up all the Senses to any other Object but that of its Terror and Amazement It is this Excess of Fear which in any eminent Danger makes a Person  This sort of Idea is strongly express'd in the  Odyssey  Gods should the stern  Ulysses  rise in might Those gates would  seem too narrow  for thy Flight  think it impossible that he should Escape and it remains so Strong and Lively that after he is got perfectly out of Danger he can scarce perswade himself but that he is still in the midst of it  With tim'rous Awe  From the dire Scene th' exempted two withdraw  Scarce sure of life look round and trembling move  Od    To the bright altars of Protector  Jove  All these are Points which lie in common between Painting and Poetry I wou'd willingly touch upon one thing more under the same View I mean those pieces in Poetry which answer Copying in Painting and each of which is really  the Picture of a Picture  You will give me leave by  Picture  here to understand any Artificial Images  of things from Embroidery Embossing or any other Method of expressing Nature by Likenesses of Art And indeed 'tis of this kind that all the Pictures spoken of in  Homer  are and I believe all in  Virgil  At least what we call Painting now was not the Painting of the  Homerick  Ages  It is to the Honour of the Art in this general Sense that the Poets when they are copying from Painting generally exceed themselves I believe there is not a more masterly Piece in all  Virgil  's Works than his Copy of  Troilus  Thus the same Hand in the Images of  Aeneas  's  Shield  As in that of  Achilles Homer  has all the Life and Expression that Poetry is capable of  In both of these the Poets use a way of speaking in relation to Picture which is very Strong and Emphatical and which may shew the high Notions they entertain'd of this Art They do not say that the Images  seem  to perform such Actions but talk of 'em as  real Life  They say directly that they Move and Act  nd Speak The Criticks who have blam'd some Boldnesses of this kind shew only their own  See  pope  and  Dacier  on the Shield of  Achilles    Book  Coldness and  want of Taste 'Tis a Figure as just as it is daring it animates the Description and where the Poet is  Thus where  Europa  is said  Terras spectare relictas  Et comites clamare suas tactumque vereri  Assilientis aquae timidasque reducere plantas  One should forget it was only in  Picture  did not the Poet take so much pains to inform us of it  Ipsa  videbatur  terras c  Verum taurum freta vera  pataras  Met  more cautious he is less lively on that very Account  My want of Skill in this Noble Art is the same disadvantage in viewing these  Poetical Pictures  as want of a proper Light would be to the  Real  but with all this Disadvantage they seem extremely Beautiful And I cannot resist the Temptation of setting one or two of 'em before you  The Design on the  Shields  affords such a variety of Images exquisitely well wrought and dispos'd so justly that it would be perfectly Gothick and Barbarous to take them to Pieces Ignorant as I am The  See  Aen    young  Romulus  and  Remus  and  Ibid    the  Genius  of the  Nile  strike me particularly in the one and in the other The  See  Pope  's  Il  to  Ambuscade  and  Engagement  the  Ibid    still rural  Prospect  and  Il    the  Dance  consider'd as a Poetitical Piece of Painting  To what Perfection must Embroidery have arriv'd in  Homer  's Days if its Works could equal his Descriptions of them How full of Life is  Od      that Figure in  Ulysses  's Robes And I suppose the  Cestus  of  Venus  was of the same Nature in which was  Ev'ry ar  and ev'ry charm  To win the wisest and the coldest warm  ond Love the gentle vow the gay desire  The kind deceit the stillreviving fire  Perswasive speech and more perswasive sighs  Il    Silence that spoke and eloquence of eyes  Hercules  's Belt and the Description of it in the  Odyssey  is the Reverse of this The Belt it self perhaps was of a different Make answerable to the Shield of  Achilles  which by the way may  ntimate something of an Art that is  ow lost which if you will allow me in  mere Conjecture of my own seems to  ave been a sort of  Mosaickwork of diffe  ent Metals  See Ιλ σ'  Brass Stannum Silver c intermixt with Gold  Ibid    all varied  nd  Ibid    shaded so as to express the differe  t  Properties and Actions of the things describ'd But whatever the materials were the Workmanship certainly excell'd them greatly Any one to be convinc'd of this need only turn his Eyes on the  Hercules  in  Ades  where  Gloomy as night he stands in act to throw  The aerial arrow from the twanging Bow  Around his breast a wond'rous Zone is roll'd  Where woodland Monsters grin in fretted Gold  There sullen Lions sternly seem to roar  The Bear to growl to foam the tusky Boar  There War and Havock and Destruction stood  Od    And vengeful Murther red with human blood  These are all Copies And I have done if you will give me leave only to set  Virgil  's  Troilus  before you which is certainly as fine a Piece as any drawn by that great Hand  Amissis  Troilus  armis  Infelix Puer atque impar congressus  Achilli  Fertur  quis curruque haeret resupinus inani  Lora tenens tamen huic cervix{que} comae{que} tr  huntu  Aen    Per terram versa pulvis inscribitur hasta  How beautiful does this look in the Poem and in the Picture Yes th  Painter and the Poet have one and th  same  Art  or rather one and the same  Power of Creating  Aut utramque credes esse pictam  Aut utramque credes esse veram  I am extremely oblig'd to you says  Philypsus  for so various a View of these Beauties Believe me I have scarce known for some time whether I was not got into some strange PictureGallery where one meets every Moment with new Subjects of Admiration and Delight The Misfortune is You have only led me thorough by the hand and given me a transient View of them when I could have dwelt Hours upon admiring each by itself 'Tis just like some Travelling Enjoyment of this kind when we have been forc'd to run over whole Apartments furnish'd with Pieces by the greatest Masters too numerous to be observ'd  articularly You have delighted me in  aste and I know not how it is I find  y self pleas'd and dissatisfied at the  ame time  I am sure says  Antiphaus  I have dealt  ith you like the  Connoisseurs  which a Traveller often meets with in places  here there are the best Collections Were you left to your self you would  njoy a thousand Beauties in them but must be plaguing you all the while with  inting out the most particular tho'  after all I know only where they stand who they were drawn by and what they represent  But we forget  Philypsus  that we are at present half Travellers in earnest We are from home and you see the Sun is just settingNointerrupted  Philypsus  We have half an Hour good at least And if you have any thing farther on this head I beg you would favour me with itAs you please says  Antiphaus  You know  e have hitherto been viewing those Points in which P  etry and Painting  ee there is one Method behind  ich P  etry has of impressing its Images  ecu  ar to itselfThe Poet  an imitate the Colours of the Painter but the Painter can never imitate the Sounds of Poetry You may  see  the Hero  all in Picture but in the Poem you  see  him fail and  hear  the Clang of his Arms  Yes  Philypsus  there is a natural fitness in Sounds Every Passion has its distinct Voice each Action its proper Turn and every Motion a particular Sound that may correspond to it  Only observe the difference in th  Sound of these Lines 'tis as sensible a  that of the real Sounds which they  describe Compare this Couplet of Mr  Pope  Od    Trembling the spectres glide and plaintive vent  Thin hollow Screams along the deep descent  With this of the same hand  The string let fly  Od    Twang'd short and sharp like the shrill Swallow's cry  Thus we might  Fluviorum rex Eridanus Georg  S  xosumque sonans Hypanis  Georg    Or these  Fluvio Tiberinus amaeno  Vorticibus rapidis multa flavus arena  In mare prorumpit Aen  Fragosus  D  t sonitum saxis torto vortice torrens  AE    compare in reading  Virgil  several Descriptions of Rivers There we have the full course of the  Po  and the windings of the  Tiber  the  Georg    largeness of  Benacus  the  Georg    slowness of the  Mincio  the  Georg    murmuring of a Brook and the broken  Aen    course of a River incumber'd with Men and Arms in a word every variety of streams that can be conceiv'd all imag'd in the various Numbers and Cadence of his Verse  In Poetry the Bow  twangs  the Arrow  Od    whizzes  thro' the Air and  Il    the Quiver  rattles  on the Shoulder of the Warrior Even the particular difference of the same sort of Actions is to be distinguish'd in the sound of the Verse and the Javelin that  Od      flies impetuous  from  Ulysses languishes  in the hand of the Suitors This very Circumstance as I take it is beautifully describ'd by the Translator of  Vida  among several other  See  Pitt  's  Vida  p  excellent Images of the same Kind  We do not only meet with a great Variety of these significant Numbers in the  Odyssey  but are instructed too in the  Methods  of rendering our Numbers proper and significant Here we are taught how the Poet roughens his Verse to imitate the Subject he is to express Thus the Note tells us that his Description of the Sea abounds    with the harshest Letter our Language affords It is clog'd with Monosyllables that the Concourse of the rough Syllable  might be more quick and close in the pronunciation and the most open and  ounding Vowel occur in every word  On the contrary a gentle flowing Stream runs as easy and smoothly in the  Description We then hear  See Note on  Od    nothing of those rough Consonants Instead of them we meet with several Liquids and those Liquids are soften'd with a multitude of Vowels  What a violent and strong Motion does  Homer  give to  Sisiphus  's Stone in its fall  Οδ λ'    Whence this Rapidity and Violence in the Numbers  See Note on  Od    If we observe it we find that  There is not one Monosyllable in the Line and but two Dissyllables Ten of the Syllables are short and not one Spondee in it except one that cou'd not be avoided in the close  which perhaps too may be of Service towards imaging the stopping of its Course at last  There is no Hiatus or Gap between word and word no Vowels left open to retard the Celerity of it  and yet tho' the Motion be carried on with such a vehemence one seems to see the  bounding  of the Stone as well as the  Impetuosity  of its Descent  I should think tho' the Notes do not mention any thing of it that the Translator  expresses this double Image in the English when he makes the Stone  Od    Resulting with a bound  Thunder impetuous down and smoak along the ground  At least In both we m  y say of the Versification as of the Stone it describes  Ipsa suis viribus ruit  The opposites to these express a Slowness and Difficulty of Motion When a Hero strains  Some rock's huge weight to throw  Mr  Pope  's Art of Criticism  The line too labours and the words move slow  Thus is  Sisyphus  describ'd in the former Picture  With many a weary step and many a groan  Od    Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone  Never was a Translator more just to his Original The Observation which has been made on the  Greek  these Lines answer will hit equally with the  See Note on  Od    English  The Verses are clog'd with long Syllables and with Vowels open upon one another the very Words are  heavy and as it were make re  istance in the pronunciation  In the same manner  Virgil  and  Homer  describe the Labour of the Giants when they endeavour to scale Heaven  Ter sunt  conati  imponere  Pelio  Ossam  Scilicet at{que} Ossae frondosum involvere Olympum  Georg  Sec Ed  Ruaei      Heav'd on  Olympus  tott'ring  Ossa  stood  On  Ossa Pelion  nods    Od    Virgil  cheifly by the openness of his Vowels  Homer  by the resistance of his Syllables and the pauses of his Lines and his Translator by slow Syllables burthen'd with several Elisions close upon one another  The Numbers are thus minutely adapted to the Motions describ'd by these great Masters And we need not wonder if they observe like Rules in Points of greater concern Such are all Occasions where they speak the Language of the Passions or endeavour to touch the Soul of the Reader either with Pleasure or Pain  When  Homer  describes any terrible Object  See Note on  Od    He rejects the more flowing and harmonious Vowels and makes Choice of such Mutes and Consonants as load the Syllables  Then long weighty Sounds and Words of many Syllables are proper and often a design'd harshness unusual pauses and a broken structure in the verse  But the Lyre must be new tuned when the Subject is agreeable or delightful The Poet then softens every Line  See Note on  Od    with Vowels and the most flowing Semivowels he rejects harsh Sounds and the Coll  sion of rough Words  The Tone of the Verse must be neither serious nor majestick but rather qualified by as great a Frequency of short Syllables as can well be admitted without rendring the Lines Weak and Effeminate The Cadence is soft and gene his Words descend like a kind re  r shing Shower or like the Snow that melts in falling  The  joyous Ver  ification  admits of more sprightly Notes and a greater Mixture  Exulting in Triumph now rise the bold Notes Mr  Pope's  Ode on Musick  of Energy and Vigour sometimes she rises even to breakes and pauses  a  See Note on  Od    but they must be always like those in Musick pauses of Delight and the Verse muse spring on again when it recovers itself without losing any thing of its Exultation and VivacityUnless some  As  Virgil  from the glories of  Rome  to the death of  Marcellus Aen    afflicting Theme breaks in and turns our Thoughts away to dismal Scenes where sighs and melancholly Reign The Muse compassionate speaks all in Tears and moves with the same  Quantos ille virum magnam Mavortis ad urbem  Campus aget gemitus vel quae Tiberine videbis  Funera cum tumulum  praeterlabere  recentem  Aen    This  Delay  also fixes the melancholly on ones  Mind and for the same reason  Repetition  seems  to be particularly useful on these subjects  Ut vultum vidit morientis  ora  Ora  modis  Anchisiades  pallentia miris  Ingemuit miserans graviter  Aen    slow Melancholly Air  It is scarce to be imagin'd  Philypsus  how great the Powers of Sounds are when adapted to the Subject and the Passion For my part I should think that our very  Bodies  are dispos'd to receive them that this Frame of ours is like an Instrument ready tun'd and when the proper Key is touch'd our Nerves tremble and answer it with a  Kind of Musical Sympathy How far this may reach in others I know not but as for my particular Make 'tis strangely susceptible of such Impressions After a Period set to Melancholy I have been surpriz'd to find my Eyes full of Tears There are some exquisite Lines which I can never read without a certain  Shivering  thorough my Blood that I cannot express to you I have felt my Spirits Burn within me upon hearing a Point of War well wrote and have been almost ready to start from my Seat at the Poetical Sound of a Trumpet  This Energy of Sounds and the great and various Emotions they are capable of raising in our Breasts may serve partly to excuse those Criticks who are very particular in laying down Rules as to this part of Versification The Ancients as well as Moderns have left us whole Treatises upon it and those who have wrote in a more general way are very diffusive when they come to this Part of their Subject They speak to every the least Circumstance and Readers who have never thought over this Point would be surpriz'd to find the great  Cicero  very industriously  ettling Quantities  and  measuring Words  fit for such and such a Period They would  wonder whence he is so peremptory for  ambicks  on this Occasion and on another so great a Partizan for  Tribrachs  and  Dactils  Why seriously says  Philypsus  I have often thought him quite tedious on these particulars The Orator even the Critick seem'd to be lost sometimes and nothing but a mere Pedant appear in their room I admire the force of Numbers continu'd he as much as any one but when I have been reading the Rules at large in the Criticks I could not help thinking them too minute and trifling If a Man must be taken up thus in weighing Syllables and ranging of Vowels what Elegance of Language can we expect or what Life in his Compositions  What you say answer'd  Antiphaus  is what I believe most Men think on this Occasion and were a Poet always to be studying his Rules such an Objection would be very powerful But it is with this which is only the Mechanism of Verse as it is in the Mechanism of Writing We must learn to draw the Figure of the Letters and study how to form the particular Turn of each  before a Man can write down a wh  le Sentence By use this knowledge gr  ws  familiar We then write by a  See  Quintil Instit  Lib Cap Est igitur usus quidam irrationalis c Or Mr  Lock  's  Essay  Lib Cap Sect and  sort of Instinct and our Pen runs over each Letter without our considering distinctly at each which way we shall direct it 'Tis much the same in these Arts of Versification When we have learn't the force of Letters and the Powers of Sound when we know what Syllables are proper to express such a Motion and what run of Verse hits such particular Images Use makes the Mind ready in applying what is proper and the Thought is as nimble in suggesting Words of a suitable Sound as the Hand is in Motions proper to set down those words on our Paper  But it will be hal  a life perhaps before the Poet can come to this Readine  sI do not say it is to be acquir'd immediately answer'd  Antiphaus  but acquir'd in some Measure it must be by any one who desires to be a true Poet In the mean time a Man may indulge his Vigour he may compose his Lines with full Spirit and set them to Musick afterwards Le  a Man write with Flame if he will but correct at Leisure  Besides this is not so difficult to be attain'd as one wou'd imagine The fitness of Sounds to things is natural  Invention  itself will go some way in the Work and where there is naturally What we call a  Good Ear  Nature will do the Business almost without the help of Art I do not speak this in a declamatory way Good  Philyps  s  I imagine Fact and Experience will go a great way in proving what I say A Man who thinks vehemently will speak swiftly and when we are on a grave Point our Words will of themselves be in a great Measure slow and weighty This is yet plainer from the  Invention  of Languages How many single Words are there in every Tongue that have been originally cast in a proper Mould and on the first Heat carried off the Images of things impress'd upon them I was saying too that the posture of the Mind at the time of Composing will assist the turn of the Composition And is this more absurd in particular Cases than that the Temper of a People in general should affect their Language in the same manner Yet has it been often observ'd that the Dispositions of a People are perceivable in that Turn of Words they chiefly delight in Thus the  French  Tongue is brisk and voluble The  Germans  talk in vast Syllables and perpetual Consonants  English  is neither too soft nor too rough tho' our  Northerly  Situation inclines us rather to the latter And as the  Spaniard  is the most haughty of all Nations their Language is the most Grand it prides itself in firm Syllables in a frequency of the fullest Vowel and the most sonorous Terminations of its Words  Nature certainly forms us within for fit Sounds We see every Day that even Brutes can express their Passions by the  Tone  of their Voice and is not an Intelligent Being as well qualified by Nature to adapt Sounds to his Senti  ent    Indeed they are thus adapted already in a Multitude of Instances Our Language abounds with such words and  n many Cases we need only utter our Sentiments in the most common Expressions to speak with this Significance What was it that led the first Inventors into this frequency of such words Was in Art or the Natural Resemblance and their Obviousness upon that Account 'Tis in this Light we must understand our Master Critick where he  calls Nature  Dion Hal    The great Original and Mistress of propriety in the present Point It is she that leads us to imitate things by Sound and to express what we conceive by Words that are turn'd according to those strong Likenesses which we form in our Minds  'Tis plain the Use of Words is arbitrary we might if we had a fancy for it call any thing by any Name Yet there is something from within that has influenc'd all Nations so  ar as to lead them to descriptive Sounds in their giving Names to things and that more frequently than one would readily imagine What Nature has done in single Words the Poet carries on in Composition Almost all the particular Names of Sounds themselves for instance are naturally significant in most Languages as with us the  Roaring  of Waves the  Whistling  of Winds c Of such Words assisted by a proper structure of Quantities and a significant Cadence of Verse the Poet makes an Hurricane by Land or a Storm at Sea Nature first presided in establishing those proper sounds and still directs in the Assemblage of them  Hence it is that this Point takes such a Compass in the Doctrine of the Criticks Some of them no doubt carry the Matter too far when they would require this Natural Significance of Sounds to be kept up in every thing we write Such was  Vossius  It would make you smile to hear some of his Fancies He talks as if every Language like that of hi  Favourites the  Chinese  should be nothing but Musick He would have our very Actions all Tuned A Soldier can't run the Gauntlet but he must be  The Ancients says he us'd Musick in eve  y thing  Adeo quod ipsae quoque plagae ad  harm  nic  s sontibus i  gerebantur  De Viribus Ry  hmi p  slash'd  in Time  and his very  Non semel recordor me in ejusmodi incidisse manus qui quorumvis etiam  can  icorum mo  s  suis

ctatio  ib p      Barber must Shave him in a just proportion of  Dactils  and  Spondees  Hermogenes  is perhaps more trifling tho' in a graver manner He questions  whether this sort of Sounds be not preferable to t  e Sentiments in a Poem  This is to oppose two Things that are in the strictest Amity and Concord These  Sounds do not like the Modern pretend to rival the Sense their whole Business is to make the Sentiments more strongly perceiv'd and more effective on the Mind  I have heard it frequently objected to those Gentlemen the Criticks that they find out several Beauties of this Kind in the Works of  Homer  which he never so much as dream't of in composing 'em In many Cases this may be true and in many the Lines may be justly commended and really significant tho' that particular Beauty might not be design'd in composing them But those who can perswade themselves that  Homer  never design'd any such thing in his Writings I should think might soon bring themselves to believe what has been so frequently produc'd as an instance of Absurdity that his Poems might be made by chance  The Notes of Musick in a good Composition are fitted to the Subject And a good Copy of Verses wrote for Musick will be fitted for Notes I cannot once doubt that the first Stanza in Mr  Pope  's Ode for St  Caecilia  's Day has a  design'd  Harmony all thorough it 'Tis just the same Case with  Homer  's Poems  They were all made for Musick and have been all sang to the Lyre  As for my part says  Philypsus  I find Musick enough in them even now without the Lyrist Neither have I any quarrel with the Criticks for giving mepleasure and pointing out Beauties of this kind whether design'd by  Homer  or not But I wonder at one thing while they speak of the Defect in this point perpetually I never yet heard them speak of any Excess in it 'Tis certain that the greater Number of Poets err in neglecting the significant Turn of their Verses but is there no erring too by an Affectation of it  I thank you answer'd  Antiphaus  for putting me in mind of this particular Undoubtedly there may be faults on both sides Even in the Poem before us I imagine this is sometimes carried too far and sometimes us'd improperly The Infirmness of a Couplet mention'd on another Occasion agrees with the thing describ'd and may perhaps be blameable on that very Account  Od    His loose head tottering as with wine opprest  Obliquely drops and nodding knocks his breast  Terrible  Images have something engaging and the Mind takes a secret Pleasure even in  Melancholly Disagreeable  Longinus  condemns a Passage in  Hesiod  on this very Account de  Subl  Cap  objects alone are the worse for being well describ'd A Poet is to reject as well as to chuse 'Tis want of Art to set every thing in a strong Light  and there are many Objects which if they must have a place at all require at least to be flung into Shades  If this be true there are some few Images of this sort which I think are drawn too strongly or too lavishly  Od    Down dropt he groaning  Od    He said chill horrors shook my shiv'ring Soul  Od    They curse their cumbrous pride's unweildy weight  Od    There wallowing warm c  To me the Screaming of the Ghosts as describ'd at the end of the  Eleventh Odyssey  is rather  disagreeable  than  dreadful  Swarms of Spectres rose from deepest Hell  With bloodless visag  and with hideous Yell  They scream they shriek sad groans and dismal sounds  Od    Stun my scar'd Ears and pierce hells utmost bounds  I leave this to your judgment for it is very difficult in these Cases to discern the  True  from the  Faulty  A  harshness  of Sounds is often proper and significant but when and how far is a knot that I will not pretend to untye  I beg leave to repeat a Passage from the  Iliad  in which some of the Lines may be strain'd too much under this notion of rendering them significant  First march the heavy Mules securely slow  O'er hills o'er dales o'er crag  o'er rocks they go  Jumping high o'er the shrubs of the rough ground  Rattle the clatt'ring cars and the shockt axles bound  But when arriv'd at  Ida  's spreading woods  Fair  Ida  water'd with descending floods  Loud sounds the Axe redoubling strokes on strokes  On all sides r  und the Forest hu  ls her Oakes  Headlong  Deepechoing groan the thickets brown  Il    Then rustling crackling crushing thunder down  This last Verse in particular may be an Instance of employing descriptive Sounds too thick upon one another but this if it be a fault is such an one as in the present state of Poetry requires an unusual Eminence in the Writer to be capable of committing it  'Tis much more frequent among our Poets to neglect the Sentiments in their Versification to give up the significant  Structure of Words for mere harmony and softness of Verse and even to make u  e of Numbers contrary to the Image or Passion they are describing tho' to describe Actions of Rapidity for instance in slow solemn Measures is as absurd as for an Actor to scold or rant with the tone and steadiness of a Philosopher  We have not time  Philypsus  otherwise I should have ventur'd on some farther Faults of our Versification but I must not now run out into Complaints on the frequent  Consonants  and frequent  Elisions  multiplied so much in our Verses tho' both ought to be particularly guarded against in a Language naturally overladen with themOn the neglect of  Measure  and taking all Syllables whether long or short to be of Equal Time and the Lameness and Inequality from hence in Verses of the same kindThe discord of the  Emphasis  or Accent and of the  Pauses  the repeated  Cadence  and continued  Likeness  of Sound I need only mention some other Identities of Sound as all middle and double Rhimes and all that are alike for two Couplets together And methinks  Philypsus  as all these likenesses of Sound would be given up at the first word unless there be some particular Reason  for retaining that fashionable jingle at the close of our Verses we may even reckon that as bad as the rest I should have said something on this but 'tis no great matter since it stands condemn'd over and over by the greatest Criticks among the Modern For my part I'le talk no more of it that we may go in Humour to our ClaretI begin to wish my self in your Parlour The Evening shuts in apace Come good  Philypsus  let us be going I beseech You  FINIS
