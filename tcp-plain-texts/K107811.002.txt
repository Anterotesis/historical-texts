that are now exhibited in the Gallery but attempts to point out new subjects for future Exhibitions And in the delineation of new subjects attention is paid to the principle laid down by our late great Painter in his notes to the translation of Fresnoy by Mr MASON  That palpable situation is preferable to curious sentiment as the Painter speaks to the eye  THE SHAKSPEARE GALLERY  As mus'd the Prophet near mild CHEBAR's stream  EZEKIEL Chap th    And pray'd his God to dart th' enlight'ning gleam  Abruptdescending from his airy height  A form angelic rufh's upon his sight  With smiling lip he cheer'd the hallow'd Sire  And bad his soul to Heav'n's best gift aspire  Then with strong hand he grasp'd his silver hair  And swift convey'd him thro' the yielding air  Along the unknown region of the sky  The dread mysterious deep abyss on high  There Inspiration her bright cloud withdrew  And pour'd her visions on his daring view  Then on his rapturekindled eye arose  Those forms of splendor those terrific shows  With which be peopled his celestial dream  And swell'd his proud magnificence of theme  To ENGLAND's Leading Bard thus Genius came  Envelop'd in a robe of holy flame  And bore him with a whirlwind's rapid force  Beyond the solar road and starry course  From which far tow'ring and tremendous height  While now he hovers with suspended flight  The Poet view'd as on a spacious plain  Of human passions the long shadowy train  'Twas then the favor'd Bard receiv'd the lore  Whose mystic veil was ne'er remov'd before  That revelation to his instinct giv'n  That ray from GOD the energy of Heav'n  To his illumin'd sight was then consign'd  The deep recesses of the Human Mind  The evervarying path of tortuous Art  And the dark passage to the Tyrant's heart  Th'umbrageous winding of the thorny road  That leads to quickey'd Jealousy's abode  The gath'ring storms that o'er Resentment roll  The swelling waves that toss the fearsul soul  The calm that breathes around the Infant's rest  The rugged cavern of the Murd'rer's breast  The dread materials by the Furies brought  With which are forg'd Despair's tempestuous thought  The shaft that mingling pleasure with the pain  Bathes in the blood that warms the Lover's vein  Oh Thou th' IMPERIAL GENIUS of our land  Take a fresh garland from thy country's hand  Triumphs unknown she hastens to proclaim  And stamp a newborn era on thy fame  Too long as with the iron power of Fate  Hath Custom bolted the Historic Gate  Enlighten'd BOYDELL bursts th' opposing bar  On their rude hinge the pond'rous portals jar  While the rapt Arts salute with loud acclaim  This rich accession to their rising name  Genius of PAINTING thy bright car ascend  Bid glowing Energy thy steps attend  Triumphant ride thro' the unrifled land  And seize thy plunder with victorious hand  Oft have we heard the pure of taste complain  Of mawkish Portraiture's eternal reign  Of exhibitions which the art disgrace  And pall the eye with many a vacant face  Let Miniature erect her fairy school  And'mid her gewgaws unmolested rule  Let her bright dome each pleas'd Narcissus seek  To her let Beauty hold her summer cheek  Let her delineate on her iv'ry plane  The nuptial simper of the happy swain  From these we turn to scenes of higher aim  Where EagleGenius soars to nobler game  Where Fancy Reason Taste in one conjoin'd  Unfold the workings of th' impassion'd mind  Now to the laurell'd academic band  To ev'ry Artist's emulative hand  Munificence upholds her sacred prize  And bids the daring reach it from the skies  While Expectation lifts the thought on high  Methinks I view with a prophetic eye  In solemn state ascend that splendid Dome  Where the proud Arts shall find an equal home  Where at the opening of some glorious day  The English mind its treasures shall display  While they whose taste is sway'd by Rigor's rule  Shall mark the wonders of the Albion School  Another gallery is to be erected for the purpose of receiving the whole collection when complete  If time shou'd e'er obliterate the gold  Of SHAKSPEAR'S language cast in Vigor's moul  Here shall invested in their various guise  The throng of his departed Forms arise  The splendid forms his mind luxuriant drew  The bold creations he held forth to view  As from their grave shall burst the num'rous host  And on these walls a new existence boast  Here shall be seen in all her charms array'd  Th'impressive figure of VERONA'S Maid  JULIET    Clos'd in the dreary vault where sleep the dead  Wrapp'd in the nightdress of the fun'ral bed  She breaks abruptly from her iron trance  And sends around a terrorrolling glance  A mournful solitary lamp shall throw  A sickly glimm'ring o'er the house of woe  And shall the wretched PARIS give to view  Stretch'd on the ground with mien of ghastly hue  Then shall a deeper spectacle display  And hang o'er ROMEO with reluctant ray  Disclosing his wan lips devoid of breath  And faintros'd cheek still beautiful in death  Then shall the beam with weaken'd effort shed  A fading glory on the FRIAR'S head  She too shall ornament the pictur'd scene  The destin'd victim of ITALIAN spleen  IMOGEN  See the base wretch perform his treach'rous part  With all the subtlety of finish'd art  Behold him bending o'er the sleeping Maid  Her holy form to his research betray'd  Eager some secret notice to retail  With rav'nous aim he lifts the slender veil  And leering marks by Nature's hand imprest  The mole cinquespotted on her snowy breast  Whose scatter'd drops to the rapt eye excel  The crimson spots within the cowslip's bell  Here too as patient as the meekey'd dove  Shall stand the Maid who "never told her love  VIOLA  "  Who to her coy and fearful bosom true  As th' unseen worm that pales the blossom's hue  Still let concealment on her beauty prey  Like snow dissolving silently away  Now at the magic Painter's wild command  Girt with the sea ascends th' Enchanted Land  There stands Simplicity's endearing Child  MIRANDA  That artless Maid the flow'ret of the wild  Beside the margin of the wavevex'd shore  While all around conflicting thunders roar  With unbound tresses flutt'ring to the wind  Her eye expressive of her tortur'd mind  She views the vessel by the surges tost  Now seennow lostnow foundnow once more lost  Till madly rushing on the pointed rock  Its bosom riven with the forceful shock  Beyond the stretch of naval art to save  Down down it hurries to the watery grave  Now PROSPERO comes with magic arts endu'd  His sable garb with hieroglyphics strew'd  Long care long study solitude profound  Has deepen'd on his brow reflection's wound  His lowdescending hair o'erblanch'd with age  Becomes the Sorc'rer and adorns the Sage  Ah view him at that dread momentous hour  While he abjures his necromantic pow'r  Within the ring of Incantation's ground  Elves Fairies Spirits Demons flock around  Beneath his foot behold the potent wand  Doom'd ne'er again to grace his lifted hand  Behold the volume which with myst'ry fraught  Predestination's darkling edicts taught  And breath'd its solemn whispers on the mind  With dust o'erspread and to neglect consign'd  Yet then the distant scenery imparts  A dire remembrance of his former arts  The bright sun fading in his full career  The wild stars madly starting from their sphere  The stormencumber'd sky the swelling main  Th' uprooted cedars stretching o'er the plain  The mountain loosen'd by convulsive throe  With ruin rushing to the vale below  And the pale wretch reversing Nature's doom  Abruptly rising from the risted tomb  What glowing Artist with bold hand shall claim  To draw Oh ARIEL thy resplendent frame  Thou tricksy Spirit with benignant smile  Thou playful meteor of th' Enchanted Isle  Not like a seanymph rob'd in sickly green  With dappled wings as on the Stage thou'rt seen  A gay transparency shalt thou appear  Thy form celestial melting into air  With foot lighttouching some fantastic height  Prompt to depart and stretching to thy flight  Yet ere we sail from this Enchanted Isle  Let other scenes our ling'ring steps beguile  There stands ANTHONIO the suggesting fiend  And half reveals his purpose to his friend  His bosom swells his madd'ning eyeballs roll  And shew the workings of his inmost soul  All that his lawless wild conceptions dare  In various forms hang hov'ring in the air  A sword freshtainted with ALONZO'S blood  A sceptre swimming in a cimson flood  A crown with dazzling ornaments o'erspread  And lightly floating o'er SEBASTIAN'S head  While in the distance rising o'er the bay  Imperial Naples shall her tow'rs display  Lo now advancing on the mimic scene  Comes forth to view the fam'd Egyptian Queen  ANTHONY AND CLEOPATRA Act ist Scence d at the end    While anxious doubts her Soldier's mind perplex  Behold her rise instructive to her sex  Ah not superior for the female heart  Endures with fortitude the suff'ring part  Tow'ring beyond the flight of tim'rous love  She bids her Warrior from her sight remove  She points her finger to the martial plain  Points to the active and the daring train  The threat'ning axes which the Fasces bear  The gorgeous streamers swelling to the air  Of busy legions the thick murm'ring swarms  The thronging shields and high emblazon'd arms  Th' encumbering elephant the rapid steed  And spoils of former conquest Glory's meed  Flush'd Conquest riding in his trophied car  And all the dread magnificence of war  Now shall the fell tremendous act be done  The THANE  MACBETH  appearsthe warning clock strikes One  His daring wild imaginings create  Such the hot chaos of his mental state  The airborn dagger and display to view  The point obscene distain'd with crimson hue  Still as we gaze shall new creations rise  And varying sceneries prolong surprise  Ere yet the skylark leaves his lowly bed  Bright on the mistencircled mountain's head  See jocund Day on airy tiptoe stand  And ope the gates of Heav'n with radiant hand  Now like two lions litter'd on one day  JULIUS CAESAR Act th Scene d  Who range the dreary wilds and share the prey  I see in dreadful harmony combin'd  Th' illustrious Pair who dignify mankind  The summercloud that dimm'd their friendship's  The passing summergale hath borne away  Yet CASSIUS then upbraids th' unmanly grief  That

HECTOR's scorndenouncing looks upbraid  The vapoury daydreams of the wild'ring Maid  While PRIAM bending at the weight of age  Rever'd parental patriarchal Sage  Half credits half rejects the tragic tale  Till terrors o'er his fading hopes prevail  Whence yonder radiant form that charms the eye  'Tis Expectation riding through the sky  A swordlike instrument she waves around  Enwreath'd with coronets with chaplets bound  Prepar'd for HENRY and his faithful train  Eager to urge the war o'er Gallia's plain  Behold the Legate from the sacred Dome  KING JOHN Act d Sce th  In the rich garb of sacerdotal Rome  CONSTANCE approaches spurning at relief  Attir'd in all the negligence of grief  In her fierce grasp she shews her rooted hair  Presenting well the image of Despair  And seem to cry

pile of human bones her throne  Sits in rude pomp th' emaciated Crone  She lifts a pale and wither'd hand on high  And on the Phantom rolls her savage eye  Whose doubtful form confounds th' enquiring sight  One part reveal'd the other lost in night  From this abhorr'd interpreter of fate  The Hag demands the future storms of state  When the Sixth HENRY prince of dim renown  Shall lose what ill

Impress'd but not o'ercharg'd with weight of years  The glow of health still blushes on his cheek  As on the winterfruit the ruddy streak  His tearful eyes his Master's wants behold  And to those wants he yields the hoarded gold  Methinks he says "With this thy care assuage  "For me let Him be comfort to my age  "Whose tender providence the Raven feeds  "And to the Sparrow yields the daily seeds"  See where the chisel with victorious strife  Has urg'd the torpid matter into life  Lo the bold Roman to our view consign'd  His air reflective of his haughty mind  Spite of the foldings of a

repair  Where press the bier those images of love  The radiant Phenix and the faithful Dove  Just o'er the summit of the funeral pyre  Wak'd by the gale ascends the sacred fire  There Philomela swells her little throat  To grace the requiem with her saddest note  There too the pitying Redbreast shall be seen  And in his bill a leaf of purest green  The Swallow shall his circling sport forego  And join this meek society of woe  The joyous Skylark by compassion won  Shall check his wonted anthem to the sun  And swiftdescending from his radiant height  Devote his music to the hallow'd rite  E'en birds shall here be seen of ampler form  Who slowly sail and dare the gath'ring storm  The Vulture here shall come at Sorrow's call  And the dark Raven spread his hov'ring pall  The Bird of JOVE shall

True to the ritual of the cypress grove  And while your souls with chaste affection burn  With garlands deck the emblematic urn  Ah now the zeal that warms my throbbing heart  For all who honor the Poetic Art  Ferments my bosom to this strong desire  That He who led the Bard's theatric quire  Whom England mournsrecording still his name  Who grappled to his own his SHAKSPEARE'S fame  That He by Sculptor imag'd here may stand  In act to speak what his great Idol plann'd  Thus have we travers'd the extensive plain  Mark'd where the mine contains the swelling vein  Mark'd where the chosen trees their branches shoot  And pluck'd the leaves that veil the Golden Fruir  The Reader will be pleased with knowing the opinion Mr BURKE passed on this Poem when it first appeared The imagery in which our great Orator conveys his sentiment forms a new and sublime allusion to SHAKSPEARE In a letter dated BEACONSYIELD January he says  I have not for a long time seen any thing so well finished The Author has caught new fire by approaching in his perihelion so near to the sun of our poetical system  Note of the Editor    THE FOLLOWING LINES Were written on the Occasion of the late Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS' resigning the President's Chair at the Royal Academy  Ye great dispensers of the magic strain  Whose harmony delights almost to pain  Ye rare PROMETHEI to whose hand is giv'n  To snatch the flame that warms the breast of heav'n  Ye too ye Bards illustrious heirs of fame  Who from the sun your mental lineage claim  Approach and see a dear and kindred Art  Unhallow'd maxims to her sons

REGANlike their hallow'd Sire expel  Cou'd not his faculties so meekly borne  Arrest the hand that fix'd the rankling thorn  Cou'd not the twilight of approaching age  The silver hairs that crown th' indulgent Sage  Domestic virtues his timehonour'd name  His radiant works that crowd the dome of fame  Say cou'd not these suppress th' opprobrious scene  And charm to slumber academic spleen  Mark mark the period when the Children stung  The Parent's feelings with their serpent tongue  It was while dimness veil'd the pow'rs of fight  The calamity here alluded to came suddenly upon Sir JOSHUA while he was painting  And ting'd all nature with the gloom of night  Not many days remov'd the Master came  With wonted zeal to touch the swelling theme  The pregnant canvas his creation caught  And drank his rich exuberance of thought  Deck'd with the beams of Inspiration's sky  Glanc'd o'er the work his finelyfrensy'd eye  Malignant Fate approach'dthe scenes decay  To him the new creation fades

ON JAMES ROBSON WHO DIED IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR OF HIS AGE BY A FALL FROM HIS HORSE  To mark the hapless Youth's disastrous doom  The sorrowwedded Father rears the tomb  On which a Mother wishes to

DESIGNED FOR A MONUMENT OF  TWO FRIENDS  Were written by the GENTLEMAN who erected the Monument and were translated at his request  CONCORDES animae quondam dum vita manebat  Nunc quoque conjunctos terra sacrata regit  THEY whom in life the bond of Friendship bound  Here in dread union press the funeral ground  THE RISE AND FALL OF THE  NORTHERN POETRY  A POEM IN TWO PARTS  TO THE EARL of ORFORD  DEAR SIR  I AM ambitious of inscribing this Poem to you as a small return for the warm commendation you bestoed upon it when the Poem was first published This also gives me an opportunity which I readily embrace of paying a public testimony to the exalted regard with which I remain  Your faithful humble servant  EDWARD JERNINGHAM  ADVERTISEMENT  THE materials that form the First Part of the following Poem are taken from the Scandinavian poetics The EDDA In the remarks on the third fable of the Edda are these words  A powerful Being had with his breath animated the drops out of which the first giant was formed This Being whom the Edda affects not to name was entirely distinct from Odin who had his birth long after the formation of the giant Ymir  This first agent or Genius whom the Edda affects not to name is supposed in the following Poem to create from his own immediate power the system of the Scaldic mythology As it would have been impossible to introduce the whole system without running into a tedious enumeration the principal features of it are only retained sufficient it is presumed to give some idea of the character of the northern poetry Among other omissions the reader will find that no mention is made of  Gimlé  the mansion of bliss that was appropriated to the reception of the virtuous nor of  Nastrande  the abode of the impious these places not being supposed to exist in their full extent till the general destruction of the world whereas the hall of Odin and the caves of Hela were peculiarly the Elysium and the Tartarus of the Runic poetry they are perpetually referred to in the ancient songs of the Scalds and the wild system of these contrasted abodes seems well calculated to encourage  that spirit of war and enterprize which runs through the whole Scandinavian minstrelsy  Some expressions taken from the Edda may appear obscure without an explanationIn the language of the Scalds the world is stiled the great vessel that floats on the agesThe rainbow the bridge of the godsTo drink the blood of friendship alludes to a ceremony performed by two warriors when they enter into an alliance of friendship they made incisions in their arms or breast and tasting each other's blood they mutually swore that the death of the first of them who fell in battle should not pass unrevenged  To celebrate the mass of weapons was to fight against the Christians whose religious sentiments the Scandavians held in contempt as thinking them adverse to the spirit of war  The Valkeries are a female troop whom Odin sends to the field of battle upon invisible steeds their function is to choose such as are destined to slaughter and conduct their spirits to the Paradise of the Brave  Fenris is a large wolf who is to break his chains at the general conflagration and to swallow the sun  THE RISE AND FALL OF THE  NORTHERN POETRY  PART I  WHEN urg'd by Destiny th' eventful year  Sail'd thro' the portal of the northern sphere  Of SCANDINAVIA the rude Genius rose  His breast deeplab'ring with creation's throes  Thrice o'er his head a pow'rful wand he whirl'd  Then call'd to life a new Poetic world  First thro' the yawning waves that roar'd around  Uprising slow from out the gulph profound  Amidst the fury of the beating storm  The giant YMIR heav'd his horrid form  Now on the stormy cloud the rainbow glows  Where gay Diversity her colouring throws  Beyond the sun the Pow'r now cast his eyes  And bade the splendid city ASGARD ise  Obedient to the loud creative call  She rises circled with a crystal wall  Her sapphire mansions crown'd with opal tow'rs  O'er which the Pow'r a flood of radiance show'rs  Now a more daring task the Genius plann'd  He seiz'd the rapid lightning in his hand  And as around the broken rays he flung  From the fall'n spires the gods of ASGARD sprung  See the dread Ash exalt its lofty head  And o'er a wide extent its umbrage shed  There twelve of ASGARD's gods in close divan  Sit in strict judgment on the deeds of man  Amidst the waving boughs enthron'd on high  An eagle sends around his watchful eye  Three virgin forms in snowy vests array'd  Stand in the deep recesses of the shade  The rich endowments of whose radiant mind  Are by the Pow'r to different acts consign'd  He gives to thee sage URDA to restore  The splendid deeds of times that are no more  And faithful as the echo to the sound  Repeat transactions that were once renown'd  Clear to thy view VERNANDI are unfurl'd  The various scenes that fill the extensive world  To thee O SKULDA the dread pow'r is giv'n  To read the counsels in the breast of heav'n  With daring forecast pierce th' abyss of time  And utt'ring first some strange mysterious rhyme  Proclaim which babe when rear'd to warlike form  Shall o'er his country roll deftruction's storm  And which directed to a better fate  Shall rise the pride and pillar of the state  Next at the awful Pow'r's commanding call  Arose to view great ODIN'S festive hall  Engrav'd with sunbeams on the crystal gate  Appear'd    Here they refude in splendid state  Who as they slept in death reclin'd their head  On valour's bier the battle's rugged bed  Who to the bliss th' intrepid claim aspir'd  Who welcom'd pain and with a smile expir'd  Now as the Genius waves his hallow'd hand  The Valkeries appear a female band  Prompt to the storm of lances to repair  On viewless steeds to scour the fields of air  Mark as they hover o'er the crowded plain  The chosen chiefs the deathdevoted train  The Pow'r now form'd the coward's dwellingplace  The seat of pain and mansion of disgrace  Deep under earth he fix'd the drear abode  Thro' which the rueful stream of anguish flow'd  Loud roar the surges thro' the gulph profound  While cavern'd echoes murmur back the sound  Close at the gate sat Death's terrific Maid  Her meagre form in sable weeds array'd  Awreath of living snakes entwine her head  And thus with shrilling voice the spectre said  'Haste to my caves ye impotent of heart  'Who meanly shrink from valour's daring part  'Ye too who ling'ring on with feeble breath  'Crept thro' the languor of old age to death'  See on the horrid battle's bleeding plain  The ravenbrood rejoicing o'er the slain  Yet then in vain they gorge the grateful food  Death smites them at the dire repast of blood  When lo their pinions to the wond'ring view  Combining into one vast texture grew  The gory heads conjoin'd in one dread fold  Around the frame a grisly margin roll'd  Now selfupborne the sable banner flings  Bold to the wind its wideexpanding wings  'Exalt' the Genius cries 'thy plumes on high  'Wave thy dark signal to the warrior's eye  'Th'intrepid Youth beneath thy magic shade  'Thro' slaughter'd heaps to victory shall wade  Tho' the Ravenbanner is not mentioned in the Edda it is of great antiquity it was supposed to be endued with some magical power and to insure success  '  Now from a rock on which the Genius stood  He mark'd below a slowlywaving wood  Then rais'd his awful voice'Hail hallow'd gloom  'Where Thought is rear'd and Fancy decks her plume  'Who hold'st within thy vast sequester'd bow'r  'A numerous train that wait the rip'ning hour  'Resign thy charge yield to demanding time  'The living fathers of the Runic rhyme'  Swift at his word the ancient sire survey'd  Tumultuous rushing from the solemn shade  Arm'd with the pow'rful harp an ardent throng  The mighty founders of the northern song  'Twas then the Pow'r resum'd'Ye chosen band  'At Nature's furnace take your faithful stand  'There forge the verse amidst the fiercest glow  'And thence the thunderbolts of Genius throw  'Rouse rouse the tyrant from his flatt'ring dream  'Full at his vices wield the daring theme  'Till o'er his cheek shall flash intruding shame  'That blushing dawn of Virtue's rising flame  'Now on the bosom of the list'ning Youth  'Impress engrave the sacred form of Truth  'Bid them as varying life unfolds to view  'Be still thro' all her scenes to honor true  'True to the man on Friendship's list enroll'd  'Th'entrusted secret of his sould untold  'Woe to that Chief and blasted be his fame  'Whose mean soul chills Affection's holy flame  'Forgetting that he once with zeal impress'd  'Drank the pure drops that flow'd from Friendship's breast  'Now to the realm ye hallow'd Bards impart  'This truth and touch with joy the human heart  'In man's too transient perishable frame  'A glowing unabating fire proclaim  'Which as that frame lies mould'ring into clay  'Shall thro' th' encircling ruin burst its way  'Thus

destroyed by INGO a Christian cathedral was erected on its ruins fourscore years after At the introduction of Christianity the interposition of angels and the appearance of ghosts grew familiar to the SCANDINAVIAN poetry which was afterwards enriched by allegories and by the accession of new images which flowed to it through various channels particularly from the East  See  RICHARDSON's  Differtation  When colleges were founded and the general attention was directed to classical learning the wild conceptions of the Scaldic minstrels gradually fell into disuseThis short Analysis

sublime awards of Heav'n  A bleeding Deitya world forgiv'n  The awestruck Bards stood bound as with a spell  While from their grasp the chill'd harp lifeless fell  The lowly valley and the hill

gorgeous scenery burst to view  The Genius joy'd to see his ancient store  Enrich'd with many a form unknown before  The clouds recede while op'ning skies display  Th' angelic hierarchy in proud array  Rank rising above rank in order due  The splendid consistory meets his view  Now spirits of another form appear  And from the yawning gravestheir shadows rear  Here glides a ghastly shade intent to shed  A scene of terror round the murd'rer's bed  There 'midst the solemn silence of the night  Beneath the halfveil'd moon's reluctant light  The shade of buried DENMARK stalks along  Fraught with his woes indignant of his wrong  See from yon infant's tomb ascend to sight  A little form attir'd in purest white  She meets the mother bending o'er the tomb  And wailing her lov'd girl's untimely doom  'Hail to thy grief' the gentle vision cries  'Hail to those tears that trickle from thine eyes  'Too feeling parent mitigate thy pain  'Nor waste thy life beneath this gloomy fane  'Ah know thy child with angels soars on high  'In the bright mansions of the upper sky  'And deck'd with wings that glitter to the ray  'Plays on the sunbeams of eternal day  'Pass a few years to Heav'n's dread

various allegoric band  First on a flow'rclad hill sublimely high  Whose brow aspiring rush'd into the sky  Hope with a cheering aspect took her stand  A radiant pencil glitt'ring in her hand  With this she colours the dark clouds that low'r  And threaten man with rude misfortune's show'r  Then Celibacy came in cloisters bred  A sluggish shardborn form with dust o'erspread  Dead to the bliss

Conscience came  Like a dire necromancer skill'd to raise  Th' accusing ghosts of her departed days  Her lab'ring heart sent forth distraction's sigh  As on the Priest she cast th' imploring eye  Then

force and splenetic of mood  The family of death and terror's brood  The moon now launching on th' expanse of night  Exulting sail'd amidst a flood of light  Along whose beams diminutive of size  A ship aerial glided thro' the skies  Which as it rode resplendent from afar  Assum'd th' appearance of a shooting star  The playful Gossimer supplied the sail  Swell'd by the pressure of the panting gale  The deck was peopled by a sprightly band  The little progeny from fairy land  The scene now chang'dthe mountain heav'd a groan  The bending forest breath'd a sullen moan  When lo three Lapland hags selfpois'd on high  Of hideous aspect struck the wond'ring eye  Their implements of art aloft they bear  And like the low'ring cloud that loads the air  They spread the texture of the fatal loom  While grim night blackens to a deeper gloom  These forms were welcom'd as they pass'd along  By savage howlings of the wolfdog throng  Disastrous ravens to this groupe repair  And bats the fiends that haunt the darken'd air  And owls the groupe pursue with heavy flight  Prophets of woe and harpies of the night  And they who 'midst the storm exulting soar  And they whose talons reek with infants' gore  See from their height the haggard shapes descend  And to the ocean's shore their footsteps bend  Where cavern'd deep in conclave dim they dwell  There utter the dread curse there breathe the spell  Hostile to man their machinations frame  And act the unhallow'd  deed without a name  Thus have we sketch'd with faint imperfect hand  The forms that peopled the poetic land  Aerial forms by

supposed to write the following Epistle was founded in the year near the village of Mascon on the river Graone The Head of this convent in the time of ABELARD was distinguished for his learning and humanity History elevates him above the vulgar herd of monks by the appellation of the Venerable PETER He extended his generous protection to the unfortunate ABELARD when he was under the censure of the court of Rome  SAINT BERNARD also is connected with the story of Paraclete This great man stands eminently forward in the picture of the twelfth century Born with a mind too restless and enterprising to be confined within the circle of monastic occupations he rushed into the tumult of active life and took the lead in some of the most important transactions of that period With an undisciplined ardour peculiar to his character he precipitated his country into that ruinous measure the second crusade Behold him at another time hastening to the contest that held all EUROPE in suspence which exhibited two contending candidates for the popedom The authority and vehemence of BERNARD overpowered the pretensions of ANACLETUS and INNOCENT was seated on the papal throne The enemies of this celebrated Abbot never impeached his moral character but it must be allowal  that in his zeal against the innovation of new opinions he has sometimes left unregarded the superior duty of charity A letter of his to the Cardinal GUIDO the pope's legate in France contains the most intolerant and sanguinary counsel  ABELARD in the following Epistle lays a considerable stress upon his sentence of excommunication In the dark ages that spiritual humiliation was felt as the greatest calamity the relation the parent the lover the friend suspended their endearing offices and withdrew from the degraded offender  THE following Poem has been distinguished by a beautiful sonnet inserted in a volume of Poems that does honour to modera poetry by Mr Taylor a gentleman whose commendation is a passport to Fame except where it is directed as in the present intlance by the amiable bias of friendship  ABELARD  to  ELOISA  YON midnight bell that frights the peaceful air  Commands the Fathers to their wonted pray'r  Now in long order flows the sable throng  Like a dark sullen stream that creeps along  Why joins not ABELARD the sainted train  Does torpid sloth his ling'ring steps detain  These walls that pillow steep'd in tears attest  That sleep is exil'd from this tortur'd breast  This lamp proclaims the same whose trembling beam  Guides while my hand pursues the glowing theme  While the dread secret from my soul I tear  And unreserv'd my bosom'd feelings bare  Ah me the passionthat my soul misled  Was check'd not conquer'd buried but not dead  Now bursting from the grave in evil hour  It hastens to its prey with fiercer pow'r  And vulturelike with appetite increas'd  It riots on the undiminish'd feast  Daughter of Paraclete dost thou complain  In iron silence that I lock'd my pain  That not to thee soft solacer in woe  I bad the troubled waves of Anguish flow  Methought the course of three long years' retreat  Would scarce thy length'ning sacrifice complete  Methought I should profane the hallow'd rite  Did my laments thy pitying ear affright  Thus at the altar wrapt in holy dread  The youth of Macedon in silence bled  Nor from his tortur'd and consuming hand  Dismiss'd the living closeadhering brand  Alluding to the boy at Athens who while he was affisting at a religious ceremony endured a burning coal that fell on his hand rather than disturb the facrifice    But now thy flow inauguration's o'er  And thou hast reach'd Religion's tranquil shore  Now that stern habit throws without controul  Her chain of adamant around thy soul  May not th' unhappy ABELARD disclose  To her who pities most his train of woes  Ye sullen gates within whose bound confin'd  The wretch who enters fiings his joys behind  Emerging from the dome ye crowding spires  Which sunrobed glitter like ascending fires  That funeral spot with many a cypress spread  Where shriek the spirits of the guilty dead  Yon moping forest whose extensive sway  Admits no lucid interval of day  No cheering vista with a trail of light  Flies thro' the heavy gloom of lasting night  Ye hermitages deep immers'd in wood  Wash'd by the passing tributary flood  Whose easy waves softmurm'ring as they roll  Lull the strong goadings of the feeling soul  Ye tow'ring rocks to wonder's eye address'd  Mishapen piles by Terror's hand impress'd  Ah not these scenes magnificently rude  To Virtue's lore have ABELARD subdued  When late my steps drew near the peopled choir  What erring wishes did my heart inspire  To the deep mysteries as I advanced  Still in thy presence was my soul entranced  While bending to the earth the choral throng  Pause ere they usher the emphatic song  While kneeling seraphs trembling as they glow  Veil with their radiant wings their bashful brow  While the deep organ as by fear controul'd  Its solemn sound like distant thunder roll'd  While thick'ning odours dimm'd the dread abode  And th'altar shudder'd at th' approaching God  'Midst these august terrific rites unmov'd  My guilty thoughts to other altars rov'd  In Love enchas'd a dearer image blest  Where burns a hungry and insatiate flame  To that soft deity I blush to

Oblivion cast behind  Words that would soil thy purity of mind  Recal recal that interesting hour  When in the flush of Youth and Beauty's flow'r  Ah doom'd severely doom'd to meet no more  When from each dearer self our forms we tore  How to Affection's finer touch consign'd  My face upon thy summer cheek inclin'd  Felt as it dropt thy tear's celestial dew  While sighs not words breath'd forth our last adieu  Intruding Fancy rais'd the veil between  And shew'd Futurity's unwelcome scene  Nights of long absence that expect no dawn  Divorcing gulphs that must for ever yawn  In thy pure soul a purer self I trac'd  Our glowing minds with energy embrac'd  Whence th' intellectual progeny arose  Which kindred fears and kindred hopes compose  Endearments tending to one mutual aim  The same our sorrow and our joy the same  Now that thy spirit is divinely wrought  To nobler objects flies thy soaring thought  For free and unrestrain'd of human ties  Thy soul uncaptiv'd springs into the skies  To Contemplation's height sublime you sail  While wings seraphic aid the hallow'd gale  From man to GOD Perfection's dazzling source  Unwearied you pursue your bright'ning course  And as thro' station'd angels you advance  Send on the throne of Heav'n a daring glance  For me unequal to this dizzy height  Undisciplin'd unwing'd for mystic flight  To speed the ling'ring step of cloyster hours

Behind the simple meek monastic vest  Ambition blazes in his troubled breast  Averse amid the pensive shades to dwell  He shuns the stillness of the lonely cell  Embroils the contests that involve

haunting me thro' ev'ry change  To tread th' advent'rous path that winds the brow  Which scowls tremendous o'er the vale below  Then to the summit of yon rock I toil'd  That shoots its crags fantastically wild  There rush'd upon my view the hallow'd cross  Cloath'd in the garb of venerable moss  This wonted pledge of mercy and delight  Struck on my fading hope a dark'ning blight  No more

Adieu thou mistress of enchanting pow'r  Thou blissful vision of a transient hour  For such appears to Fancy still how dear  The sloping race of Rapture's swift career  When Heav'n enforcing its benign decree  With lavish bounty gave thy form to me  Hope now is dead and Pleasure's knell is rung  With sable thoughts my dreary mind is hung  'Twas at the hour when from the sorrowing view  The glowing God of day his beams withdrew  When Vesper all her pageantry display'd  Fretting the sky with many an awful shade  Here trees appear'd that struggled with the storm  There a wan cloud assum'd a spectre's form  A solitary hand here grasp'd a spear  There angry meteors combated in air  Now riding on the wind with threat'ning mien  The dark terrific phantom Death was seen  From a thick

This kind assurance mitigates my doom  Thou'lt stand the guardian angel at my tomb  Clos'd be this form in ELOISA's fane  She'll sigh my requiem with a Lover's strain  Oft to my grave with sorrowful delight  Will she repair as glooms the thick'ning night  Burst from thy cloud Oh Cynthia burst away  The holy shado of her frame display  Let the soft texture of her length'ning shade  Repose along the spot where mine is laid  Were thus her presence to my wishes giv'n  Death would rejoice my grave would then be Heav'n  Forgive this last effusion of a heart  Which Love and Nature form'd unstain'd by Art  Which midst the fears that wait on Death's decree  With all its wonted ardor darts to thee  Prepare prepare for that relentless day  When the dark hearse this form shall bear away  When to the fane of Paraclete convey'd  My humble bier shall at thy feet be lald  Prepare preparethrow back the vestal gate  Receive the victim of untimely fate  Receive the man misfortune held to view  Still mid his woes invariably true  The warm enthusiast now from passion free  Whose life was one continued hymn to thee  Prepare prepareyet check the bursting moan  Thou to compassion exquisitely prone  Lest

The suppliant tears that gall'd her cheek  And last her agonizing shriek  Lock'd in her hair a ruthless hand  Trail'd her along the flinty strand  A ruffian train with clamours rude  The impious spectacle pursu'd  Still as she mov'd in accents wild  She cried aloud  My child my child  The lofty bark she now ascends  With screams of woe the air she rends  The vessel less'ning from the shore  Her piteous wails I heard no more  Now as I stretch'd my last survey  Her distant form dissolv'd away  "That day is past I cease to mourn  Succeeding joy shall have its turn  Beside the hoarseresounding deep  A pleasing anxious watch I keep  For when the morning clouds shall break  And darts of day the darkness streak  Perchance along the glitt'ring main  Oh may this hope not throb

darts of light  Pierce the loose film that dims the eaglet's fight  First with an ignorant and coy survey  The dazzled bird admires the stranger day  Then glancing on the sun with tow'ring gaze  Kindles his vision at the noontide blaze  Meek Toleration heav'ndescending Maid  A vernal rainbow glitt'ring o'er her head  Smooths the rough path destructive feet have trac'd  Adorns and peoples

Superstition madd'ning at th' alarm  Extend in thunder cloath'd her threat'ning arm  But with'ring at the heart she rues the hour  That harshly severs her diminish'd pow'r  Thus as the serpent sleeping on the plain  Feels the rude pressure of the loaded wain  With apt revenge and indignation stung  She rears her crest and darts her fiery tongue  But impotent of rage her trailing wound  She languishingly sweeps along the ground"  Here clos'd the Seraph his illustrious theme  Which on his audience flash'd conviction's beam  And now th' Enthusiast with her hand highrear'd  Express'd a look

 THIS Historical Interlude is formed upon the plan that ROUSSEAU composed his PYGMALION which is a new species of Dramatic Entertainment consisting chiefly of a monologue that is often suspended by the interposition of music  The following little Drama was written for that ornament of the Stage Mrs POPE who performed it on the night of her benefit This Interlude has also been performed at BRANDENBURGH House the part of MARGARET received from the theatrical abilities of her Serene Highness the Margravine the richest colouring and the most impressive truth of expression  The subject is taken from a remarkable incident in the life of MARGARETThat unfortunate Queen flying with her Son into a forest after the battle of HEXHAM saw a Robber approach with his naked sword and finding that she had no means of escaping she suddenly embraced the resolution of trusting entirely for protection to his generosity The man  whose humanity and generous spirit had been obscured not entirely lost by his vicious course of life was struck with the singularity of the event and charmed with the confidence reposed in him and he vowed not only to a  stain from all injury against the Queen  but to devote himself entirely to her safety and protection  HUME  NB  The asterisks mark the pauses that admit the music  CHARACTERS  OFFICER  PEASANT  EDWY the Robber  EDWARD the Prince of WALLS  MARGARET

Ah rather lead me to the deep recess  Of this broad forest haply I may find  My royal Mistress Better I endure  The pang that gushes from this gaping wound  Than my mind's torture for the hapless Queen  Exeunt  Enter  MARGARET  and her  SON  The fierce pursuers will not here perchance  Discover us the thickinwoven umbrage  Of these gigantic trees will spread concealment  Yet as their solemn branches wave strange fear  Possesses me yet all is still as night  The shouts of rebel victory are lost  And fade away ere they can pierce these shades  Ah what a victory He whose meek sway  Solicited his people's grateful love  My HENRY England's monarch is no more  While I a wretched outcast of the throne  Rove desolate amid these savage walks  Of ev'ry comfort ev'ry hope bereft  To her Child  But thou my EDWARD still art mine Ah lay  Thy weary limbs on yonder bank and I  Will watch beside thee  Leads him to a Bank  He sleeps unconscious of the dire distress  That hovers o'er his

floating in the blood of all his friends  Ah what a sight it urges me to madness  Yet all that courage cou'd effect was done  When wild Dissension her torn banners rear'd  Which insolently wav'd o'er HENRY's head  While he beneath their shade a captive stood  I feeble agent hurried to the field  And at that moment losing all the fears  That haunt the female breast I call'd to Loyalty  To snatch my HENRY from Rebellion's arm  The valiant troops who then encircled me  On WAKEFIELD's day perform'd their duty well  And on St ALBAN's memorable plain  I saw defeated WARWICK wing his flight  And rescued HENRY hasten to these arms  Yet what avail these momentary triumphs  Ev'n while I speak my faithful HENRY lies  Extended on the plain deform'd with wounds  While o'er his sacred corse the hostile band  Irreverently pass and with vile taunts  Upbraid his overthrow nor was I present  To solace his last moments catch the accents  Of his departing voice and close his fading eyes  Th'

while a murm'ring noise that tells  The coming storm sounds thro' the conscious branches  Of this wood Ah where shall I betake me  Walking in a distracted manner    If at some hamletdoor I knock these robes  Will sure betray me and the sum that's set  Upon that Infant's head ah will it not  Invite the simple cottager to treachery  Yet here to brave the stern inclement sky  With all the horrors of descending night  My trembling heart refusesI will lead  Him hence Vain thought Ah to what stranger heart  Dare I conside my Son Shou'd he be torn  From these weak arms yes well too well I know  This anxious heart wou'd at that moment burst  The Pow'r above who sees into the depth  Of my great sorrow knows that not to pride  That not to Exaltation's gaudy honors  I e'er entrusted my felicity  Amid the rude misfortunes that encircled me  The pulse of pleasure throbb'd within my breast  When I embrac'd my Son of him bereft  Calamity's sharp fangs will tear my heartstrings  I feel I feel her now fell tygress at  My bosom gorging on my mangled peace  Ye cruel ruffians give me back my Son  Ah me wild fear foreruns my loss and joins  The future moment to the present time  Kneeling  Oh thou allseeing Providence if e'er  The scenes on earth attract thy sacred notice  Then let thy knowing cleardiscerning eye  Whence radiant Pity beams o'er my misfortune  PauseAnd thus humbly as I bend resign'd  Let let my falling ruinous state o'erwhelm  The Mother but not crush the Child  Rising  The night encreases I must wake my Son  Hanging fondly over him  How sleep posiesses him I Perhaps this slumber  Is doom'd his lastperhapswhat do I see  Stretch'd on a bier methinks I see him gash'd  With daggersAh 'twas fancy bodied forth  This cruel image still my EDWARD breathes  And these fond arms embrace my living Child  PRINCE  Oh Mother lead me hence  MARGARET  Say whither shall  I lead my EDWARD  PRINCE  Lead me to my Father  Why do you weep Ah wherefore not reply  Say is my Father slain  MARGARET  I know not that  PRINCE  Whence was that noise  MARGARET  It was the chiding gale  Ah no it is the sound of hostile steps  Enter  ROBBER  ROBBER  Whoe'er thou art I see thou'rt in distress  I too am well acquainted with misfortune  And greater still than thine for at my door  Pale Famine sits while starving children send  A mournful peal if aught thou hast conceal'd  Within this wood give me the hoarded treasure  MARGARET  Ah here is all my treasure  Pointing to her Child  ROBBER  Cease to trifle  Give me thy treasure or I'll slay thy Child  MARGARET  Arrest that impious arm He is thy Prince  Talk not of want of Misery's scourging hand  Complain no more in me in me behold  Distressful MARG'RET ENGLAND'S vanquish'd Queen  And all the treasure left her from the field  The cruel havock of this morning's fight  Is center'd in this Child  ROBBER  Thanks to my GOD  I'm not so lost in vice so deepingulph'd  In woe but that my Sovereign's distress  Obliterates my own  MARGARET  Is't possible  ROBBER  Ah cease to wonder at the words I speak  Of affluent parents born my youth was rear'd  To virtue letters and to social manners  The sacred ray that once illum'd my breast  Is shaded not extinguish'd and buried  But not deadI feel it now rekindling  The warm functions of my soul while loyalty  Renovates my love of virtue  MARGARET  Frankness  Like this solicits my belief  ROBBER  Forbear  To linger here where dangers lurk around  I'll lead thee thro' some dark and winding pathway  Of this wild forest to a neighbouring river  Where rides a bark whose canvas courts the gales  That fly to other realms  MARGARET  Ah must I then  Forsake this country Is there no safety  But in exile  ROBBER  None Behold how anarchy  With giant steps stalks o'er the trembling land  At her approach the sumptuous palace falls  The Norman castle stretches its long ruin  Down the mountain's sideWith louder vehemence  The civil deluge rolls and rushes thro'  The portals of the sanctuary The temples  Are profan'd the hallowed walls dismantled  The choirs deform'd the altars overthrown  The ministers amidst their awful duties  Massacred their snowy vestments drench'd in blood  Away away and shun these scenes of horror  MARGARET  Dethron'd oppress'd forsaken of all hope  Can I weak object instigate teir malice  PRINCE  Say say will not the ruffians spare my Mother  ROBBER  Endearing Youth Ah trust not to their mercy  The hungry wolf wou'd sooner spare the lamb  Their thoughts are lawlesss daring wild and savage  They'll tear that infant from thy clinging arms  And banish him for ever from thy sight  While thou deserted by thy powerless friends  Shalt wander forth a trembling fugitive  The pointed mockery of a lawless rabble  MARGARET  Oh what a scene you picture to my view  ROBBER  Haste then my royal Mistress haste away  The bark I lately mentioned is peopled  Tho' by a small a brave intrepid band  Devoted to my service Their sympathies  Will catch th' expanding flame that fires my soul  That moves and urges me in scorn of danger  Even at the daring hazard of my life  To save protect distressful Royalty  MARGARET  Generous Stranger lead me to your vessel  Advancedirect the wayI dare confide  Myself and my lov'd Child to your protection  Reft of a crown a husband ev'ry friend  Amid this mighty ruin EDWARD lives  And wretched MARGARET still shall be a Mother  Exeunt  TO THE MEMORY OF THE LATE LADY JERNINGHAM  LINES WRITTEN IN THE ALBUM AT COSSEYHALL NORFOLK THE SEAT OF SIR WILLIAM JERNINGHAM AUGUST THE TH  I  THOU to whose sacred page the parting guest  Confides the workings of his grateful breast  With awful pleasure o'er thy form I bend  My gift to bringas brother guest and friend  Farewell ye shades ah not to fame unknown  Where Elegance has rear'd her attic throne  Whose beauties to the pure of taste address'd  In Nature's charms munificently dress'd  Whose soft amenity with grace combin'd  Display the emblem of the master's mind  FarewellSay shall I not regret the bow'r  Where social intercourse endear'd the hour  Where she whose footsteps bless this sylvan seat  The pride and mistress of this calm retreat  Her soul illum'd with Wisdom's piercing beam  Sheds round her circle the enlight'ning gleam  II  Ye scenes o'er which I cast a ling'ring view  O'er which affection breathes a warm adieu  That hour I now recal with pleasing pain  Which gave your beauties to my wish again  Yet then as I approach'd your smiling shore  Prompt expectation gladly flew before  Wing'd with gay hope as nearer still I drew  Hills plains and woods assum'd a brighter hue  Softwreath'd in lilac vestment laughing May  With hailing aspect met me on the way  The various vale with eager steps I press'd  Praise on my tongue and transport in my breast  O'er each lov'd spot I sent a fond survey  Where in the morn of life I wont to stray  The winding walks by memory endear'd  Where with the growing plants my youth was rear'd  Embow'ring shades in whose deep gloom immers'd  Reflection fed me and the Muses nurs'd  And screening from my view ambition's sky  Pour'd other visions on my raptur'd eye  III  Yet Album ere the willing task I leave  Warm rom the heart these closing lines receive  'Twas at the hour to contemplation due  When evening meekly from the world withdrew  Beneath an aged oak in pensive mood  I Sorrow's solitary captive stood  When from the rifted trunk's obscure recess  A voice breath'd forth in accents of distress  "Where where is she of mild and rev'rend mien  "Once the lov'd mistress of this sylvan scene"  "Fall'nfall'nfall'nfall'n"a distant voice replied  The branches shook as if to sense allied  Wild Terror flung his strong enchantment round  And evening hurried into night profound  Now fond remembrance turns a willing sight  To dwell on gayer scenes of past delight  Pleas'd to behold her midst the polish'd train  With grace with dignity her part sustain  To mild festivity by nature prone  With inbred wit peculiarly her own  Prompt ev'ry sportive incident to seize  Diffusing pleasure with a careless case  Of pow'r to charm invincibly possess'd  Unfelt she glided into every breast  There are who fram'd with an enlighten'd taste  High on the critic form by judgment plac'd  Who marking well her sense with strength combin'd  The scintillations of her playful mind  An aptitude that never lost its aim  With brilliant SEVIGNE' inwreathe her name  To discontent the vice of age unknown  Her chearfulness maintain'd its envied throne  The gay the old the learned and the young  And they whose heart pure elegance had strung  By the soft pow'r of her enchantment won  Would oft the glare of throng'd assemblies shun  To court her ready wit's enliv'ning beam  And bask beneath its undulating gleam  Yet oft from these unnotic'd would she steal  To soothe the bedrid stretch'd on Torture's wheel  To smoothe the furrow on Misfortune's brown  To warm the timid and exalt the low  With lenient hand administer relief  And close the bleeding artery of grief  Ah ever dear ah venerable Shade  Indulge this honor by Affection paid  Enthron'd in bliss ah yet forbear to shun  This holy tribute from a zealous Son  'Twas mine attendant on thy evening ray  To watch the sunset of thy blameless day  To see thee weary of th'unequal strife  Shed the faint glimm'rings of exhausted life  And heavenly Moralist sublimely great  At the dread opening of thy future state  Teach by example to thy latest breath  Meekness in pain and fortitude in death  Just Published  THE THIRD EDITION
