 A FURTHER ACCOUNT Of the most Deplorable Condition OF Mr  EDMUND CURLL  BOOKSELLER  Price Three Pence  A FURTHER ACCOUNT Of the most Deplorable Condition OF Mr  EDMUND CURLL  BOOKSELLER Since his being POISON'D on the th of  March  To be publish'd Weekly  LONDON  Printed and Sold by all the Publishers Mercuries and Hawkers within the Bills of Mortality  A FURTHER ACCOUNT Of the most Deplorable Condition Of Mr  EDMUND CURLL  Bookseller  THE Publick is already acquainted with the Manner of Mr  Curll  's Impoisonment by a faithful tho' unpolite Historian of  Grubstreet  I am but the Continuer of his History yet I hope a due Distinction will be made between an undignify'd Scribler of a Sheet and half and the Author of  a ThreePenny stitcht Book like my self  Wit  saith Sir  Richard Blackmore    proceeds from a Concurrence of regular and exalted Ferments and an Affluence of Animal Spirits rectify'd and refin'd to a degree of Purity  On the contrary when the igneous Particle rise with the vital Liquor they produce an Abstraction of the rational Part of the Soul which we commonly call  Madness  The Verity of this Hypothesis is justify'd by the Symptoms with which the unfortunate Mr  Edmund Curll  Bookseller hath been afflicted ever since his swallowing the Poison at the  Swan  Tavern in  Fleetstreet  For tho' the  Neck  of his  Retort  which carries up the Animal Spirits to the Head is of an extraordinary Length yet the said Animal Spirits rise muddy being contaminated with the inflammable Particles of this uncommon Poison  The Symptoms of his Departure from his usual Temper of Mind were at first only  speaking civilly to his Customers  taking a Fancy to  say his Prayers singeing a Pig with a new purchas'd Libel  and  refusing Two and Nine Pence for Sir  R  B  's Essays  As the poor Man's Frenzy increas'd he began to  void his Excrements in his Bed read  Rochester  's bawdy Poems to his Wife  gave  Oldmixon  a  slap  on the  Chops  and wou'd have kiss'd Mr  Pemberton  's A  by Violence  But at last he came to such a pass that he wou'd  dine upon nothing but Copper Plates  took a  Clyster for a whipt Syllabub  and eat a  Suppository  for a  Raddish  with  Bread  and  Butter  We leave it to every tender Wife to imagine how sorely all this afflicted poor Mrs  Curll  At first she privately put a  Bill  into several  Churches  desiring the Prayers of the Congregation  for a  wretched Stationer  distemper'd in Mind But when she was sadly convinc'd that his Misfortune was publick to all the World writ the following Letter to her good Neighbour Mr  Lintott  A true Copy of Mrs  Curll  's Letter to Mr  Lintott  Worthy Mr  Lintott  YOU and all the Neighbours know too well the Frenzy with which my poor Man is visited I never perceiv'd he was out of himself till that melancholy Day that he thought he was poison'd in a Glass of Sack upon this he took a strange Fancy to run a Vomiting all over the House and in the new wash'd Dining Room Alas this is the greatest Adversity that ever befel my poor Man since he lost  one Testicle  at School by the bite of a black Boar Good Lord if he should die where should I dispose of the Stock unless Mr  Pemberton  or you would help a distressed  Widow for God knows he never publish'd any Books that lasted above a Week so that if we wanted  daily Books  we wanted  daily Bread  I can write no more for I hear the Rap of Mr  Curll  's  Ivory headed Cane  upon the CounterPray recommend me to your  Pastry Cook  who furnishes you yearly with Tarts in exchange for your Papers for Mr  Curll  has disoblig'd ours since his Fits came upon himbefore that we generally liv'd upon bak'd MeatsHe is coming in and I have but just time to put his Son out of the way for fear of Mischief So wishing you a merry Easter I remain your  most humble Servant C Curll  P S  As to the Report of my poor Husband's stealing a  Calf  it is really groundless for he always binds in  Sheep  But return we to Mr  Curll  who all  Wednesday  continued outragiously Mad On  Thursday  he had a  lucid Interval  that enabled him to send a general Summons to all  his Authors  There was but one Porter who cou'd perform this Office to whom he gave the following Bill of Directions where to find 'em This Bill together with Mrs  Curll  's Original Letter lye at Mr  Lintott  's Shop to be perus'd by the Curious  Instructions to a Porter how to find Mr  Curll  's Authors  AT a Tallowchandlers in  Petty France  half way under the blind Arch Ask for the  Historian  At the Bedsted and Bolster a Musick House in

Flux be overyou may also speak to the Gentleman who lyes by him in the Flock Bed my  Indexmaker  The  Cook's Wife  in  Buckingham  Court bid her bring along with her the  Similes  that were lent her

 for the old Beetlebrow'd Critick and the purblind Poet at the Alley over against St  Andrews Holbourn  But this as you have time  All these Gentlemen appear'd at the Hour appointed in Mr  Curll  's Dining Room two excepted one of whom was the Gentleman in the Cockloft his Landlady being out of the way and the  Gradus ad Parnassum  taken down the other happened to be too closely watch'd by the Bailiffs  They no sooner enter'd the Room but all of them show'd in their Behaviour some Suspicion of each other some turning away their Heads with an Air of Contempt others squinting with a Leer that show'd at once Fear and Indignation each with a haggard abstracted Mien the lively Picture of  Scorn Solitude  and  short Commons  So when a Keeper feeds his hungry Charge of Vultures Panthers and of  Lybian  Leopards each eyes his Fellow with a fiery Glare High hung the bloody Liver tempts their Maw Or as a Housewife stands before her Pales surrounded by her Geese they fight  they hiss they gaggle beat their Wings and Down is scatter'd as the Winter's Snow for a poor Grain of Oat or Tare or Barley Such Looks shot thro' the Room transverse oblique direct such was the stir and din till  Curll  thus spoke but without rising from his Closestool  '  Whores  and  Authors  must be paid beforehand to put them in good Humour therefore here is half a Crown a piece for you to drink your own Healths and Confusion to Mr  Addison  and all other successful Writers'  'Ah Gentlemen What have I not done what have I not suffer'd rather than the World should be depriv'd of your Lucubrations I have taken involuntary Purges I have been vomited three Times have I been can'd once was I hunted twice was my Head broke by a Grenadier twice was I toss'd in a Blanket I have had Boxes on the Ear Slaps on the Chops I  have been frighted pump'd kick'd slander'd and beshittenI hope Gentlemen you are all convinc'd that this Author of Mr  Lintott  's could mean nothing else but starving you by poisoning me It remains for us to consult the best and speediest Methods of Revenge'  He had scarce done speaking but the  Historian  propos'd a History of his Life The  Exeter  Exchange Gentleman was for penning Articles of his Faith Some pretty smart  Pindarick  says the RedStocking Gentleman would effectually do his Business But the  Indexmaker  said their was nothing like an  Index  to his  Homer  After several Debates they came to the following Resolutions  Resolv'd  That every Member of this Society according to his several Abilities shall contribute some way or other to the Defamation of Mr  Pope  Resolv'd  That towards the Libelling of the said Mr  Pope  there be a Summ employ'd not exceeding Six Pounds Sixteen Shillings and Nine Pence not including Advertisements  Resolv'd  That Mr  D  make

Ferments  in order to  enliven  their  cold Sentiments  being his true Receipt to make Wits  These Resolutions being taken the Assembly was ready to break up but they took so near apart in Mr  Curll  's Afflictions that none of them could leave him without giving some Advice to reinstate him in his Health  Mr  Gildon  was of Opinion That in order to drive a  Pope  out of his  Belly  he should get the Mummy of some deceas'd Moderator of the General Assembly in  Scotland  to be taken inwardly as an effectual Antidote against Antichrist but Mr  Oldmixon  did conceive that the  Liver  of the Person who administred  the Poison boil'd in Broth would be a more certain Cure  While the Company were expecting the Thanks of Mr  Curll  for these Demonstrations of their Zeal a whole Pile of  Essays  on a sudden fell on his Head the Shock of which in an Instant brought back his Dilirium He immediately rose up overturn'd the Closestool and beshit the  Essays  which may probably occasion a  second Edition  then without putting up his Breeches in a most furious Tone he thus broke out to his Books which his distemper'd Imagination represented to him as alive coming down from their Shelves fluttering their Leaves and flapping their Covers at him  Now  G  d damn  all  Folio's Quarto's Octavo's  and  Duodecimo's  ungrateful Varlets that you are who have so long taken up my House without paying for your LodgingAre you not the beggarly Brood of fumbling  Journeymen  born in  Garrets  among  Lice  and  Cobwebs  nurs'd upon  Grey Peas Bullocks Liver  and  Porter's Ale  Was not the first

Shelves  lac'd your  Backs  with  Gold  equipt you with splendid  Titles  and sent you into the World with the Names of  Persons of Quality  Must I be  always  plagu'd with youWhy flutter ye your Leaves and flap your Covers at me Damn ye all ye  Wolves  in  Sheeps Cloathing Rags ye were and to Rags ye shall return  Why hold you forth your  Texts  to me ye paltry  Sermons  Why cry yeat every Word to me ye  bawdy Poems  To my Shop at  Tunbridge  ye shall go by G  and thence be drawn like the rest of your Predecessors bit by bit to the  PassageHouse  For in this present Emotion of my Bowels how do I compassionate those who have  great need and nothing to wipe their Breech with  Having said this and at the same Time recollecting that his own was yet unwiped he abated of his Fury and with great Gravity apply'd to that Function the unfinish'd Sheets of the Conduct of the E  of  N  m  FINIS
