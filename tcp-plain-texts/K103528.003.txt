Whitehall London  Anno    MEMOIRS OF TATE WILKINSON  THE present to Mr Rich procured me an invitation to dine with him which favour I did not accept but paid my devoirs to him at his morning leveesMy old master Rich one day said to me  "  Muster Williamskin  you are much improved since I first began to  larn  you I think I must engage youName your terms"  I then proposed on that hint a plan for such a  mber of nights rather than for the seasonHe instantly agreed and Mr Foote's Minor was fixed on for immediate preparation nay he deigned to desire me to cast the parts I was in such sudden favour as he said with truth he knew nothing of  Muster Footy's  farce Mrs Rich was a Methodistnot that I mention it as a recommendation or that she was a better Christian for bowing at the shrin  of Nonsense and HypocrisyMr Foote's lash on Methodism at that time was severely felt by that sect their composition is gloom melancholy envy and spleen cheerfulness is seldom observed to dawn on their countenances Notwithstanding their boasted inspirations if Methodist preachers had a little reflection what must they think of daring to pronounce every theatre the devil's house and all the players the devil's children I hope they are jokingand though it may be joking I am sorry to say it is wicked To make a complete actor requires more requisites to universally excel than almost any other profession whatever  The amazing powers displayed by a Garrick a Barry a Mrs Cibber and a Siddons and many others is evidently the hand of GodHe alone could give the finish to such intrinsic merit And that the Almighty has intended them for that very work is evident which if not so produced the world would have lost seeing the highest pitch of admiration the human frame can aspire to To mention Shakspeare only proves more than all the beforementioned persons as he is a host and stands unequalled as a moral writer in many points as well the wonder of the world as an universal genius  I do not wish to insinuate that  every Methodist  is an hypocrite but I mean that I think the greatest part are really soSo of the preachers I believe there are some in earnest though I fear the number might be easily told When persons get to the height of a Whitfield and a Wesley's fame for acting there is a pride as well as a duty in behaving well and they both laboured hard but I dare say neither of those gentlemen ever refused a golden ticket for their separate benefits any more than I ever didO yes  I  actually did  once refuse five guineas  at York but I was  modest  and rejected it I expected it to be offered a second timeIt was not what then Why then I was  disappointed  and never will be so foolish again if opportunity offersLet one of the tabernacle boast the samethey know betterand that a bird in hand is worth two in the bush But O ye saints of your own creating I will preach to youMark  Judge not of plays and players lest  you  be judged  Those who are the most censorious on the infirmities of others are usually most notoriously guilty of far greater failings themselves and sanctified Methodistical slander is of all the most severe bitter and cruel and is so easily distinguished unless by the elect that it is not worth while dwelling any longer upon it  In the comedy of the Hypocrite the Colonel says he supposes they go to the play for the benefit of the brethrenCantwell answers  "The charity covereth the sin"  which was actually the case for in the year as Shuter was bountiful to the tabernacle Mr Whitfield not only permitted but advised his hearers to attend Shuter's benefit but  alamode theatre  for that night only  A preacher at Hull was once in distress and imprisoned I actually sent him a leg of mutton and turneps previous to that I had been an attendant at his tabernacle he entertained great hopes of my conversion and I certainly confess to the being wicked enough to have been deemed a tolerable Methodist I had then quitted the old playhouse in Lowgate for a new one in Finklestreet That the principal performers of conventicles love to follow the smell of a theatre is evident by their particularly consecrating those unhallowed shops and thinking them enviable situations to practise their own lovefeasts in  "Put out the light and then"  So this Rev Mr Rutherford formerly a London coachman erected his pulpit on the spot where Brutus had been in  his  pulpit alsothe pit he converted into pews and the stage and side boxes were appropriated for the beaus and bellesHere follows  most truly copied his letter to me caused partly by the brass rims not being come from York to Hull for he told me over a bottle to which he had no aversion that he wanted a collection to purchase candlesticks and I having left off using those brass rims when Mr Garrick changed the mode of lighting the stage with six branches that used formerly to be let down at the end of every act which required a nimblefingered candlesnuffer I promised my reverend father the Methodist I would light his tabernacle aye and performed it too  To TATE WILKINSON Esq  DEAR SIR  AS your engagements in public and mine run counter I did not know when to wait on you as to a proper season and therefore as you were so good and sympathising to act from such a noble spirit of humanity to the distressed as proposing to take a pew in my chapel in Lowgate I shall leave these four best pews to the generosity of the persons that engage so whoever leads the way will be a pattern for the others I verily think without the least flattery that your encouragement of such things will be such an honour to the stage and bespeak the fame to the comedians as will perpetuate your name  more than Alexander the Great's I shall be glad to know what place you fix on and when I shall wait on you and whether the  candlesticks are come  May Heaven load you with all kind of blessings for time and an unseen world  From your humble and Much obliged servant ROB RUTHERFORD  Hull  Jan  At times I have heard good discourses from Mr Whitfield delivered with energy feeling and pathos but then he had been really and truly an actor on the stage in the early part of his life and as he liked tragedy and found that a pair of squinting eyes as may be seen by his print did not move the young ladies' tender hearts but produced laughter instead of tears he dd the stage and ever after stuck to that text but he often melted and squeezed to some purpose many a rich dowager who felt the power of his feelings from their mutual sympathy The low stuff of the preachers in general is not worth repeating but to shew I have not often attended without sometimes being a good boy I will begin with the second best performer in that line I ever saw and give his harangue verbatim and tho' but frothy stuff it is much better and more like reason than the damnation so terribly thundered out  oo often in stage invective so much so that were they not hardened by the familiarity of their fire brimstone and pitchforks if it thundered I should fear less if in a playhouse than in the tabernacle particularly if near the preacher  Mr Wesley about four years ago in the fields at Leeds for want of room for his congregation in his tabernacle gave an account of himself by informing us That when he was at college he was particularly fond of the devil's pops or cards and said that every Saturday he was one of a constant party at Whist not only for the afternoon but also for the evening he then mentioned the names of several respectable gentlemen who were with him at college  "But" continued he "the latter part of my time there I became acquainted with the Lord I used to hold communication with him On my first acquaintance" said Wesley "I used to talk with the Lord once a week then every day from that to twice a day till at last the intimacy so increased that He appointed a meeting once in every four hours"  He recollected he said the last Saturday he ever played at cards that the rubber at Whist was longer than he expected and on observing the tediousness of the game he pulled out his watch when to his shame he found it was some minutes past eight which was beyond the  ime he had appointed to meet the LordHe  thought the devil had certainly tempted him to stay beyond his hour he therefore suddenly gave his cards to a gentleman near him to finish the game and went to the place appointed beseeching forgiv  ness for his crime and resolved never to play with the devil's pops again That resolution he had never broken and what was more extraordinary that his brother and sister though distant from Cambridge experienced signs of grace on that same day on that same hour in the month of October After the easy acquaintance he had made the idea of which I think too solemn to declare and mention in the familiar manner those selfelected people do What must have become of all the tribes before us for the last seventeen hundred years but damnation How un  tunate that Me  hodi  m did not start up through a trapdoor many centuries ago What a hypocritical ledbythenose world it would then have been  Mr Wesley after expatiating on the devil's pops said  "Now my dear friends if you think there is no harm follows from playing at cards why play at cardsIf you think my dear brethren there is no harm in hunting a poor little hare and depriving it of life why you may go ahunting without being guilty of sinI do not say you will be dd for that provided in your  conscience you do not think you are doing wrongIf you think there is no harm in playing with the devil's books or going to an assembly where you shall stay till two or three o'clock in the morning and where they dance belly to belly and back to back and put themselves in the most unseemly postureswhy if you think there is no harm in going to that assembly you may go I am told" continued Wesley "you have a wicked playhouse in LeedsI do not say you will be dd for going to see a play if you think there is no harm in seeing a play But now my dear brethren let me call you to a recollection of these trifling matters Though you have heard me repeat that I do not pronounce damnation on my hearers for playing with the devil's pops or for killing a harmless hare and depriving it of lifethough I have not said the devil is with spreading arms expecting to receive you but that you may go to an assembly or even to the devil's house without damnation yet my dear brethren if instead of the devil's pops the going ahunting or to the dancing assembly or to see a play you can like me get acquainted and enter into conversation and intimacy with the Lord who will talk who will hold converse with you here on earthhow can you prefer such vanities of this foolish world to  real bliss in this and the world to come"  Here ends Mr Wesley  The Rev Mr Whitfied the first actor in the Methodist walk was of a contrary cast entirely and not without humour here and there His dialect was very particular  Lurd  instead of Lord  Gud  instead of Godas  O Lurd Gud  I remember a text of his was  May we all work the  arder    "There was a poor woman and she was a long time before she was converted she was threescore years and tenyes she wasshe was threescore years and ten  "Sir says she to the good man that converted her Sir says she I am threescore years and ten I have been a long time about it but Sir says she I will work the harderyes Sir says she I will work the harder"  And O may you all like that dear good woman work the harder"  Then followed a groan of applause for he had like Mr Bayes a selected number in his pit that understood their cues and were sure to applaud and the rest of the house followed of course Then Whitfield looking round the rails of his little desk below  "What you young ones why you are some of you twelve some fourteen and some sixteen years of age yet you do not think of going to hell What" exclaimed Whitfield "twelve and fourteen years of age and not thinking of going to hell O ye little  brats you"  and at that instant the old women groaned and like fell Charybdis murmured hoarse applause and Whitfield shook his head and growled in his white wig exactly like my performance of Squintum as I actually practised it from the serious comical discourse I am now relating Whitfield then proceeded thus  "You go to plays and what do you see there Why if you will not tell me I will tell you what you see thereWhen you see the players on the stage you see the devil's children grinning at you and when you go to the playhouse I suppose you go in rufflesI wonder whether St Paul wore ruffles No there were no ruffles in those days I am told" continued he archly "that people say I bawlwell I allow it I do bawl and I will bawlI will not be a velvetmouthed preacher I will not speak the word of  Gud  in a sleepy manner like your church preachersI'll tell you a story  "The Archbishop of Canterbury in the year was acquainted with Mr Betterton the player One day the Archbishop of Canterbury said to Betterton the player "Pray inform me Mr Betterton what is the reason you actors on the stage can affect your congregations with speaking of things imaginary as if they were real while we in the church speak of things real which our congregations only receive as if they were imaginary"  "Why my Lord says Betterton the player the reason is very plainwe actors on the stage speak of things imaginary as if they were real and you in the pulpit speak of things real as if they were imaginary" Therefore" added Whitfield "I will bawl I will not be a velvetmouthed preacher"  I leave the reader to judge on the good reasoning of Methodism I cannot help noticing for the honour of the stage that Mr Whitfield could not have betrayed himself into a better story for its credithis pointing out an intimacy between the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury and Mr Betterton And for the actor he could not have given a more substantial and revered authority And what a joke for Mr Whitfield to pronounce damnation on players when he certainly avowed in his own opinion that Mr Betterton was what all the world ever acknowledged him to be a scholar and gentleman of honour and Mr Whitfield gave the players reasoning and exemplification for his own mode of preaching But hypocrisy like the cloven foot will sometimes be espied  Some of the wild preachers of this kind often remind me of Antonio in the Merchant of Venice  Mark you this Ba  anio  The devil can cite scripture for his purpose  An evil soul producing holy witness  Is like a villain with a smiling cheek  A goodly apple rotten at the heart  O what a goodly outside falsehood hath  Bell's edition bears this note on these lines A most excellent remark this for daily experience proves that some of the worst characters breathing seek shelter under scriptural texts by the misapplication or misconstruction of which also opposite sects uncharitably consign each other to eternal punishment  As a striking instance of goodwill charity and mildness being prevalent in the minds of Methodists I insert the following paragraph from Mr Bowling's Leeds paper  "At York Assizes William Richards for robbing the TheatreRoyal was ordered to b  transported for seven years and on the Western Circuit a man was convicted of robbing a Methodist Chapel and sentenced to one year's imprisonment Thus in the eye of the law a  House of Prayer  is just one seventh the value of a  Den of Thieves  "  LEEDS MERCURY  But now for my tabernacle at CoventGarden where myself and Mr Rich were lately casting the  comedy of the Minor and which was the occasion of my preaching Mr Rich and I were on such sudden terms of violent friendship that he insisted I should cast the parts I put down the Minor Mr DyerRichard Wealthy Mr Sparks c c c  The morning after a note came from Mr Sparks for Mr Rich to the following purport  "Mr Sparks's compliments to Mr Rich he is concerned at being obliged to return the part of Richard Wealthy but as he is given to understand Mr Wilkinson is engaged and is to sustain the principal characters in the comedy Mr Sparks cannot  onsent by any means to perform or assist in any piece for the advantage of a villain who unprovoked has endeavoured to hurt him in his peace of mind and injure his reputation as an actor with the public"  When Mr Rich gave me the note to read it perplexed me much but I immediately adverted to my very disagreeable situation when at DruryLane and that I had given up every idea of offending the actors of CoventGarden that by the artifice of Mr Garrick and Mr Foote I was forced on the stage at DruryLane in against my own consent and requested Mr Rich further to observe that when my own benefits happened at DruryLane in and not any actor whatever had been offended by any imitations or  mimicry from me that my sole aim was levelled at Mr Foote for the illtreatment I had received from him and as a stronger proof I referred to my conduct in Dublin the winter before where I had not created a single enemy by such behaviour nor at my benefit the spring before at DruryLane or offered any entertainment of the kind either from the desire of my friends the public or even to assist my own emolument on my late benefits in London which it certainly must be acknowledged it would have done and much to my advantage but I readily lessened my own profits rather than incur enmity I had in consequence of that consideration hoped that I had cleared myself from all intentional injury to Mr Sparks or other gentlemen This fully proved to my own mind for once in my life the good policy of having laid by imitative talents Mr Foote excepted all that time for had I kept publicly practising those shining qualities as I judged them and though I was then certainly in great estimation while under the trammels of Mr Foote and Mr Garrick yet had I at the latter part of my time with him made too free with my brethren of the theatres very likely I should not have stood any chance of rising again in London hastily or have been ever received at CoventGarden theatre Indeed I might have subsisted on Mr  Garrick's flaps of the shoulders of mutton but like poor J  rry Sneak not have got a bit of the brown My reasons to Mr Rich worked as palliatives in my behalf and had much weight with him He sent for Sparks and in his manner related to him what  Mr Williamskin  had said Sparks in a short time was cool and pacified and said On the whole it appeared perfectly clear that the young man was not so much to blame as he had supposed that it was apparent Wilkinson had not received any reward or gratuity for what he had done from either of his masters Foote or Garrick but on the contrary they had been guilty of meanness and ingratitude And Sparks concluded with not only his declared acceptance of the part but offered every assistance to the rehearsals to aid and bring the Minor forward for its being levelled as a stroke at Foote tickled Sparks as gratifying his ancient grudge Though Mr Foote's acquaintance was universal yet as all knew he spared neither friend nor foe there could not be the least reason to apprehend a shadow of resentment from the audience by any attack of mimicry played on Mr Foote himself from any opponent as Mr Foote attacked every body and like Drawcansir might have said to his friends  I huff I bluff I strut look big and stare  And this I do becauseI dare I dare  A most intimate friend of Mr Foote's wrote to me the following lines on my being displeased and is a strong likeness  "Mr Wilkinson you should have known him better long before this time of day then you would have looked upon him as a peculiar man with such gifts of originality relative to men manners and placeswhether he is in general right or wrong I will not pretend to say but I will give you this as my own opinion that if he is wrong it is difficult to dispute with him and when he is right it is impossible to answer him"  Peace being settled and myself one of the CoventGarden company Foote soon got intelligence from spies in our royal camp of what was going forward he was much enraged and not having forgiven my freedoms with him at Dublin the winter before he thought I pursued him like his evil spirit And one morning when I was sitting at the grand levee at Mr Rich's with my new friend Sparks in council of war we were alarmed with a thundering rattat and ringing of the bell also when a servant announced Mr Foote was come to wait on Mr Rich and instead of being ushered into the grand saloon he had been shewn into the parlour  Mr Rich went down to Mr  Footseye  as he called him but the visit was not accompanied by  a calm for it was most violent blustering and boisterous Mr Foote furiously exclaimed  "Damn it you old hound if you dare let Wilkinson that pug nosed son of a bh take any liberty with me as to mimicry I will bring you yourself Rich on the stage If you want to engage that pug black his face and let him hand the teakettle in a pantomime for damn the fellow he is as ignorant as a whore's maid And if he dares to appear in my characters in the Minor I will" said Foote "instantly produce your old stupid ridiculous self with your three cats and your hound of a mimic altogether next week at DruryLane for the general diversion of the pit boxes and galleries and that will be paying you you squinting old Hecate too great a compliment"  And after a few sarcasms Foote hastily departed denouncing vengeance on him and his cats and immediately Mr Rich appeared with a most woeful countenance and said  why  Muster Sparkish Muster Footseye  has been here and he says if I let  Muster Williamskin  act his parts on the stage  Muster Sparkish  he will write parts for me my cats and  Muster Williamskin  and bring us all upon the stage so we must not act  at we intended" "Why surely Sir" said Sparks "you cannot be so weak as to let Mr Foote's  apouring visit frighten y u from your purpose or intimidate you from having a piece acted that may be  of service to your theatre and to the young g  ntleman Is it not truly strange and laughable that Mr Foote of all people should confess himself galled and exert his wit against mimicryhe who has been for years an universal torturer and spoiler of private peace from the licentious liberties he has taken Now Mr Rich" added Sparks "let me interest myself in this matter I augur success therefore let us of CoventGardentheatre immediately rally our forces take the field let slip the dogs of war and act the Minor in defiance of his own guards at DruryLane"  Rich agreed seemed pleasedbut he was still frightened of Foote and I believe dreaded an affront on his favourite cat more than on himself all was settled to have the performance brought forward as soon as possible for as Sparks observed  "advantage  fed them fat while we delayed  "  Indeed the Minor was ready at DruryLane and they meant not to lose time for Foote entertained not the least doubt of victory  We from various obstacles could not get it decently on the stage in less than a fortnight as other pieces were preparing such as Mr Macklin's new comedy of the Married Libertine his LovealaMode and Mr Beard and Miss Brent were rehearsing Dr Arne's new opera of Thomas and Sally which all considered made it seem difficult  to get our Minor produced And on the end of the week that this matter had been settled it was advertised on the Thursday from DruryLane and on the Saturday was pasted on every wallThe MINOR and that favourite little comedy had been all the week puffed and paragraphed in every newspaper by Mr Foote But unforeseen events sometimes do and undo what our utmost wisdom and wishes cannot as here was an extraordinary instance for the bills were but a few hours exhibited to public view when it so happened they were as hastily plucked down as they had been vigilantly put up it was on Saturday the th of October when the sudden death of our truly beloved and lamented monarch King George II occasioned for three weeks a suspension of theatrical hostilities and diversions of all kinds in the great city of London And  eriously wish abstracted from self some alleviation could be considered for a truly loyal set of  eople the actors on such a melancholy occasion For though it is undeniable that every attention and grateful demeanour should be indispensibly observed on such an awful stroke and that a hoity t  ity following  f diversions would be highly improper and th  t every duty to such solemn  ty is due yet  t certainly falls cruelly on the poor player I reverence and love my king my  prince and my country as the most faithful subject in his majesty's dominions yet at such really mournful times the poor player in a middling class who  struts his life upon the stage  is certainly destitute of daily bread becomes distressed and absolutely reduced to being a charitydependent where the weekly stipend had been merely an existence and too likely if encumbered with a family plunged into debt and future misery It may easily be credited that whenever such a calamity happens and which in the course of nature must happen many are not in possession of a shilling it is even a hardship to those who possess economy which some actors and actresses to their great credit and good sense do as Mr Robertson formerly of the York company is an instance and an honour as a man and actor to mention and several others whose incomes have been very confined  Now as a good subject my stock was truly great on the sudden surprise and loss of my monarch whose name I had prattled from childhood  Monarchs sages peasants must  Follow thee and come to dust  My own situation at that time did not suffer as tha  od I possessed every needful requisite then  to render life happy and every way agreeable so the theatre being closed for a few weeks was not any inconvenience to my particular self but the poor actor at such a time must be rejoiced if the landlord is in good humour and will cha  k up instead of receiving cash but then the day of retribution must and will appear in black and white  Thus comes the reck'ning when the banquet's o'er  It so happened and came to pass during that serious vacation that the Minor was brought to maturity at CoventGarden theatre and what is more extraordinary by the indefatigable attention and eagerness of Mr Sparks  Once my mortal foe  When DruryLane again opened the first Saturday they published the Minor with Mr Foote c I posted myself in the gallery Mr Foote was received as usual with great eclat by a most brilliant and crowded audience that comedy being in as much vogue then or more so than any favourite piece at the present day of the run and rage of the School for Scandal and Duenna being now overWhen the comedy was finished I hastened to CoventGarden and urged Mr Rich to produce the Minor as soon as possible when Mr Dyer who was to act the part of Sir George and who was the particular intimate of  Sparks judged it a political stroke to give out that  iece for the Monday following and though the  lay before intended had been given out we pre  ailed on Mr Rich and the Minor was announ  ed as by particular desire for the Monday Mr Foote's characters of Shift Smirk Mrs Cole and the Epilogue by Mr Wilkinson It was not only honoured with an overflowing  heatre but had a very great reception and it had a considerable run and in that puff I had the  dvantage for Mr Rich's new matters were not  eady for representation therefore I was the more wantedMr Foote shared the profits of his night's performance for that reason therefore if Garrick had any thing strong to advertise or wished to play himself Mr Foote was obliged to give way On the second night of my performance Mr Rich at the end of the Minor brought an article for me to sign accompanied by Mr Wood his soninlaw an attorney the purport was one hundred guineas for playing till the first of January and a benefit when I chose to appoint it It was a very genteel offer as my benefit considered made it of real consequence to me and of course the proposal was by me accepted signed and sealed On the first night in the per  ormance of Shift I broke loose into my imitative  qualities which I had not practised as to actors in London for two years  Mossop had but the year before gone to Ireland he was very peculiar very popular and well recollected I was very like him indeed and was obliged to repeat his speeches of Zaphimri in the Orphan of China  To prove what odd mortals we are as to our love and our hate Sparks who I related as formerly to have been my professed enemy was now turned to the other extreme and was my hearty wellwisher On my leaving the stage as Shift he took me fast by the hand and wished me joy and burst out into a violent fit of laughingSays I  "Mr Sparks what are you laughing at" "Why" replied he "I am laughing at myself Sir for two years ago I was bloody angry at you for the carrying me into company where I was not yet your imitation of Mossop was so strong that I was irresistibly pleased whether I would or no so I am laughing at my own absurdity"  Those imitations having been bottled up by me so long had then double the effect and made Shift a star in the MinorMy introduction in the character of Foote was truly Foote from top to toe and as to Mr Garrick I made no scruple though I had him before me as his curiosity had led him to see me not expecting that I would take him off or he would  not have been so publicly surrounded but have carefully avoided such a queer situation My imitations were never told either in bill or newspaper who they were designed for but whenever I was particularly lucky the audience would repeat the name as Sparks Sparks Barry Barry Nor was I a little pleased when repeating from Macbeth  "Who can be wise amazed c"  I heard the audience echo from one to the other  "O Garrick Garrick"  O thought I my master this is my day of triumphand from that night he never forgave or forgot his being so surrounded in the front box nor did he ever speak to me again to the day of his death  My Whitfield was beyond compare his manner was then universally knownMr Foote was struck by stepping in by chance and once hearing Whitfield the mixture of whose absurdity whim consequence and extravagance pleased his fancy and entertained him highly as Whitfield that day was dealing out damnation fire and brimstone as cheerfully as if they were so many blessings What pity it is that our fears only and not our reason will bring conviction but reason handed by unaffected pure piety and religion would be a day of woe to Methodism and lessen their audiences in many tabernacles where they are certain to lament preaching to nobody  though at the same time wedged to the outer doors and on the Sunday exclaiming at the full crowded theatres which have probably been almost deserted But Mr Foote was only a spy at Whitfield's academy while I had been a zealot for some seasons before my encounter at Covent Garden with Mr Foote My attendance had been constant with my friend Shuter and as he actually was one of the newborn and paid large sums to Whitfield I was always permitted to stay with him for he really was bewildered in his brain more by wishing to acquire imaginary grace than by all his drinking and whenever he was warm with the bottle and with only a friend or two like Mawworm he could not mind his shop because he thou  ht it a sin and wished to go a preaching for Shuter like Mawworm believed he had had a call I have gone with Shuter at six in the morning of a Sunday to TottenhamCourtRoad then before ten to Mr Wesley's in LongAcre at eleven again to TottenhamCourtRoad tabernacle dined near Bedlam in Moorfields a very proper place for us both with a party of the Ho  y Ones went at three to Mr Wesley's theatre there the tabernacle  mean from that to Whitfie d's in Moorfields till eight and then shut up to commune with the familycompact Now with all this practice and attention and with my  natural talents I must have been a blockhead indeed not to have gleaned some good things and doubtless Mr Whitfield was at times a good preacher and truly excellent I therefore really exhibited and obtained a much stronger likeness as Dr Squintum than Mr Foote did The week before my CoventGarden exhibition I met my friend Shuter at the tabernacle a great coolness had continued for some time as we had not spoke to or even looked at each other since the breach between us in the year but as we were met together in a place of charity and forgiveness to all who subscribed to the dictator we became very sociable and before the conclusion of Whitfield's lecture were perfectly reconciled We adjourned to the Rose and by three the next morning were sworn friends and continued so till death called him away  ndeed he was above eleven years older than me and would have been sixtythree had he lived to this time Ned Shuter was a lively spirited shrewd companion superior natural whim and humour surely never inhabited a human breast for what he said and did was all his own as it was with difficulty he could read the parts he had to play and could not write at all he had attained to SIGN an order but no more Nature could not have bestowed her gifts to greater advantage than on  poor Ned as what she gave he made shine not only conspicuously but brilliantly and that to the delight of all who knew him on or off the stagehe might be truly dubbed  "The Child of Nature"  He was no man's enemy but his own Peace rest and happiness I hope he now possessesfor the poor the friendless and the stranger he often comforted and when sometimes reduced by his follies he never could see a real object in misery and resist giving at least half he was worth to his distressed fellow creature  My popularity that year of the Minor was such that my acquaintance I might truly term universal My benefit was the week before Christmas and was not only crowded but honourably attended which put my finances into a most respectable accumulation though my free living from place to place was very expensive and indeed extravagantYet the reader is to observe my benefits in general were all free from any charges and were what we on the stage term  clear benefits  and my night being numerously attended in the middle of a winter season in such a metropolis as London cannot be judged a phaeno  enon  That season at CoventGarden theatre the day after acting the character of Mr Foote in the introdu  tion to the Minor I received an anonymous letter and recollected the same sentiments  had been conveyed to me in the like manner three seasons before after my benefitnight at DruryLane on taking off Mr Foote as himself not as an actor on the stage The contents were nearly as follows  To Mr WILKINSON  SIR  THOUGH your imitation of Mr Foote last night was certainly great yet your twitching your chin with tweezers was very wrong though well conceived but on the stage it was a blemish and not any advantage to your imitation for you should consider the audience are only judges of Mr Foote's public stage performance and not of how he acts or speaks when in his own house and with his acquaintance and particular intimatestherefore omit those peculiarities of Mr Foote's and you will not lose but increase your reputation with the town and the good opinion of  SIR  Your wellwisher A Z  These two notes I often considered as the remark was so just though I had not paid obedience to the first and made me guess from that  time to the present that they proceeded from the secret good wishes and knowledge of Mr Murphy who was often on parties at Mr Foote's and knew what I meant when the public did notWhether it was to him I was obliged or no he best can tell if he did it may have escaped his memory and he may not recollect so trivial a circumstance as it did not relate to himself Why I take the wisdom to myself of thinking the letters came from Mr Murphy who had behaved very kindly to me is that in on my benefit night at DruryLane as I was acting the character of Mr Foote he Mr Murphy was sitting in the orchestra and as I grew elated with applause and feeling to myself that all I did was right I too often made use of a particular word which Mr Foote thoughtlessly and from custom often repeated laughingly in his own room in common conversation it was a word foolish and indelicate and by no means fit to be presumptuously or ignorantly mentioned in a public theatre and I had never thought as to the meaning but was I declare most perfectly innocent of it and from my rapid  ty of speech the audience luckily indeed for me did not attend to it any more than mys  lfAnd as Mr Sher  dan's  the Critic says  "The players never know when to have done with a good thing"  so did I often repeat  this unfit word before a most respectable audience I saw Mr Murphy in the orchestra enjoying my performance and applauding which gave me double vigour when on a sudden he started up and I lost from the situation full before me him whom I had seen in such high humour therefore I feared something was very wrong but what I could not divinebut I do suppose what  I said  so repeatedly had frightened him from his pleasant seatLuckily for me the loud laughter and applause drowned the senses or I might have seen more decampments or myself have been ordered so to do and I am certain had I been at that time disgraced I should not have known for why But all went off to my excess of joy and when I saw Mr Murphy some days after he kindly explained what had drove him from his place as he declared he trembled for me and gave me at the same time proper information sufficient to rectify my error and improve my breeding without need of Johnson's Dictionary for further knowledge This is a lesson for all imitations to be confined entirely to the modes and manners only with which the audience are acquainted for the private manners in life of Mr Garrick or Mr Anybody they are neither familiarized to nor in the least acquainted with therefore foolish to add by way of garnish as what might please in a private  circle with information will naturally lessen the merit of the mimicry or satire instead of increasing it with the public and indeed it must be allowed as unmannerly as mean and on no account worthy forgiveness were it tolerated to rehearse private foibles manners and conversation on a public stage  My friendly reader I fear will be apt to shrink and think I have been too liberal in praising and loading myself with encomiums relative to my applause and reputation in London in as a rival in point of mimicry in the public estimation when opposed to Mr Foote but I really aver and believe I have not exceeded the strict bounds of truth As to the exactitude of time and place I am persuaded this olio will stand foremost of almost any produced self is generally partial and I am obliged to be the herald of my own praises for Shakspeare says  "  If a man will not erect his own tombstone ere he dies his memory shall liv  no longer than his knell rings and his widow weepsHow long is that An hour in clamour and a quarter in r  eum And so much for praising myself who I m  self will bear witness am praiseworthy  "  Indeed I can mention several persons still living who can attest every particular I am sorry to say not so many as I could wish as most of my sincere friends and benefactors ar  now no more  As a true imitator I stood before Mr Foote in the public eye for though he drew characters strongly yet his manners in point of likeness were not strictly just besides my partial friends of that time who cannot now come when they are called and for all I know may now be spirits in the  vasty deep  yet as theatrical and honourable vouchers I ref  r to Mr Macklin and Mr Murphy who will not I trust deny they often told me I was in some particular imitations incomparable and I was too well bred then and now to contradict their favourable opinions but verily think they were good judges and spoke only the truth Mr Macklin has often acted by me as a particular kind friend and to him I am in debt for many obligations of tender regard paid to my juvenile years and since and as I never made him any equal return confess myself his obliged and grateful debtor Mr Murphy I have not the satisfaction or pleasure to call an intimate or even common acquaintance my frequent laughs with him at that distant juncture of time were chiefly occasioned by my often meeting him on parties at Mr Foote's and at the New Exchange coffeehouse but Mr Macklin and I have often met in Dublin sometimes in the same theatre sometimes in our different ships of war and meet him where I would I cannot but remember civilities not only  to me but to any friend I took in my hand to introduce to him  With a full purse a stock of health and plenty of good friends my CoventGarden engagement ended after which I soiled till PassionWeek drew nearA week that occasions the players never to forget it is a religious one though their superiors may not have the same feeling occasion to rub up their memories but every player and playeress can recollect that week without a prompter  Mr Garrick as I before observed continued obdurate but thank God I neither wanted his forgiveness nor his favours as a manager  Early in March I was favoured with a letter from my good friend Mrs Strode at Portsmouth informing me that a world of people were expected there as a grand expedition was preparing against the French and the number of officers and subalterns both of army and navy would be incredible ju  t before  aster that there were no plays going forward nor any diversions whatever and if I could but hit on any entertainment it would turn out lucrative to me and be received as a compliment to the town and all my friends and acquaintance I made proper inquiries on receiving this pleasing intelligence and heard every thing Mrs Strode had mentioned in a manner so  friendly soon confirmed Now the love of money added to the allurement of wandering seemed to me irresistible I knew nothing could be done there in PassionWeek though I might prepare for the ensuing holidays but did not conceive how to manage and contrive without an able assistant Mrs Strode at my request procured the theatre against my arrival but one auxiliary at least became indispensably necessaryI mentioned the matter to my laughing whimsical friend Joseph Austin who liked a frolic as well as myself I therefore did not hesitate a moment as to whom I should impart my perplexity To him I related my newfangled scheme and want of assistance also laid before him the glaring temptations of armyofficers c and proposed terms of agreement Without a pause our wise heads settled it immediately and that we might be more sure of attractive merit Joseph clapped in his lady as a third performer a very pretty woman into the chaise and on Palm Sunday we sat down to supper at Portsmouth We found the playhouse as the company of comedians had left it a mere wreck They had torn away all traces of its former selfall little ornaments of what it ought to have beenhaving removed all the wings and  agged scenery for their more remote theatres  with Juliet's tomb and balcony even Desdemona's bed  Had been seized by the hands of filthy dungeon villains  And thrown amongst the common lumber  And conveyed in their baggagecart at Portsmouth to their fortress at Plymouth themselves having a long and heavy winter march and indeed I fear the greatest part of that theatrical army were obliged on the expedition to use their legs instead of carriages to obtain safe footing at their distant Devo  shire encampment which proves the truth of the old proverb  One half the world knows not how the other half live  My friend Joseph and I had a most whimsical entertaining week I am sure he never can forget it as it consisted of oddity and ma  y freakish occurrences From ten till two at noon we were busily employed with plaistering paper on laths for our wings and filling up the back part of the stage with something like what we term a flat scene indeed we had a carpenter but Joseph and Tate were the principal workmen Before the week was expired our playhouse was prepared for the receiving a most splendid audience with which we were honoured even our stage was crowded and produced the best back flat scene I ever saw  which well paid us for our industry We were not only gratified with the great house being lucrative and fashionable but we were still more flattered and pleased by a desire of a second night and with the assurance of good support for my own part I had been so fettered and confined while articled by Mr Garrick that I was rejoiced at being what I liked to be and ever will be if I can FREE  as air  that by choice shall ever be my motto therefore the second night was palatable and quite agreeable to me But here a difficulty arose I had engaged to perform for my friend Shuter's benefit on Thursday March and that promise without breach of word honour or friendship was easy and practicable as time would just allow it and not any to spare but my trepanned friend Joseph on this smuggled expedition was likely to be tried for offences at the grand court of Drury by Judge Garrick a severe judge who would demand his bond as Joseph had actually engaged to play the Wednesday night March a new part wrote by Mrs Clive for her own benefit who at writing was as may with justice be equally said of myself  a dead good one  However he was very happy and temptation lay before himSo fell AdamSo fell Joseph though he has not the least relationship  to Joseph the BashfulNotwithstanding his perilous situation he yielded to entreaty though he foresaw and dreaded the inevitable storm We performed much the same kind of jumbled incoherent entertainment as we had done on the first night We had a full house on the Tuesday and soon after supper that night my friend Joseph Austin set off with his lady for London and left me behind to settle all bills c for our private and public expenditure My friend got to London in a whole skin but too late for his part and indeed he had been so laden the week before with state affairs upon his head and shoulders that had he been there a day sooner I do not suppose he had studied sufficiently to have known a sentenceThe lamentable consequence to Mrs Bayes or rather Dame Clive was her being obliged to submit to change her new farce or have an apology made for the part to be readwhich I understood was kindly undertaken by Mr Packer but am not certain However the piece was unfortunately dd and the dreadful doom of it she attributed entirely to the neglective and audacious behaviour of that impudent Austin it enraged that truly comical lady on the stage only to the highest pitch of fury not Ceres with her torch set the fields of corn on fire with more eager fantastic fury than she would have at that instant  sacrificed even the highpriest of the  ynagogue Garrick himself could she have dragged him to her altar of revenge but  "such divinity surrounds a king"  that he escaped her vengeance by a secure and speedy retreat and if truth may be spoken I am inclined to think on this matter he was more indebted to flight than his divinityship for safety as be it known though our monarch Garrick used to be lordly and managerial over great and small yet Dame Clive like the Welch was never subduedindeed the great little man dreaded her As an instanceI remember one night while I had the honour to appertain to DruryLane theatre Lethe was to be acted by desire of several persons of distinction The bill run thus  A dramatic satire called Lethe  The new character of Lord Chalkstone by Mr Garrick and not any other performers mentioned not even Woodward's or Yates'sMrs Clive's part was the Fine LadyThere were several actors of merit in the piece but whether it had been printed in that manner by design or accident I know not as playbills published daily must be liable to errors even though Mr Kemble was the manager Madam Clive at noon came to the theatre and furiously rung the alarm bell for her name being omitted was an offence she construed so heinous that nothing but vengeance and blood blood  Iago was the word and it was no more strange than true that Garrick ever feared to meet that female spirit Perhaps Mr Cross the prompter might think Garrick's name was allsufficient but her not seeing in the bill  "The Fine Lady by Mrs Clive"  was so unpardonable an offence that could she have got near him and he had been severe in his replies I dare say she would have deranged King David's wig and dress as adorned for Lord Chalkstone which would have disconcerted him much Mrs Clive was a mixture of combustiblesshe was passionate cross vulgar yet sensible and a very generous woman and as a comic actress of genuine worth  indeed indeed  she was a diamond of the first waterWhen her scene of the Fine Lady came on she was received with the usual expression of gladness on her approach as so charming an actress truly deserved and her song from the Italian Opera where she was free with a good ridiculous imitation of Signora Mingotti who was the darling favourite at the King's Theatre and admired by all the  amat  urs  she was universally encored and came off the stage much sweetened in temper and manners from her first going on  "Aye" says she in triumph "that artful devil could not hurt me with the Town though he had  struck my name out of the bills"  She laughed and joked about her late illhumour as if she could have kissed all around her though that happiness was not granted but was willingly excused and what added to her applause was her inward joy triumph and satisfaction in finding the little great man was afraid to meet her and which was of all consolations the greatest not our brave Rodney could feel more pride or glory on the French Admiral de Grasse delivering up his sword to him than Madam Clive did in the idea of her subduing Garrick The valiant Boadicia never hurled her spear with more furor than Clive that Amazonian Thalestris of DruryLane theatre pursued that great general Garrick whenever he offended her indeed the whole greenroom dreaded her frowns She was the original and quite at home when in the Cobler's Wife in the Devil to Pay and always proved that Poor Nell had a great soul indeed to those who approached her door in misery she supplied their wants and gave at once without pride or ostentation Mr Garrick alluded to Mrs Clive in Nell and Mrs Pritchard in the Queen in Hamlet when he wrote and spoke the following lines the season that Barry Cibber Quin and Woffington united forces at CoventGarden  Our ladies too with hands and tongues untam'd  Fire up like Britons when the battle's nam'd▪  Each female heart pants for the glorious strife  From Hamlet's Mother to the Cobler's Wife  So Madam Clive of whom I have been speaking so long when her farce was dd as she could nor start that Fox Austin from his hidingplace at last found Mr Garrick her darling prey whose curiosity had led him back to take a peep at the field of battle after beholding her farce and its fatal overthrow and had exultingly fat smiling at the tumult and enjoying the storm which gratified his spleen and indeed her works I believe were truly indifferent and would not have cut a much better figure in print than my own with this difference she professed ability I profess quite the contrary cry quarter and sue for mercy Clive like the good housewife who sees a rat in the trap in the morning taken no sooner espied him than she fastened and the furious poetess bitterly and vehemently harangued her manager as abetting and aiding in a plot to sink her works to oblivion by being privy to Austin's having eloped and thereby destroying her fame The manager protested his innocence nay acted great  ge denouncing severe and unheardof punishments on Austin for certainly my friend Joseph being absent from his royal duty and in a time of  war was not to be defended and what added to his crime in Mr Garrick's eye was that he had been with that infernal exotic Wilkinson to whom he never granted absolution He dd Wilkinson he dd Foote and said  "Lacey I say ecod we will have no more exotics at the theatre"  and concluded with a determination to discard Austin for he was at that time really angry and offended with him and much disapproved of his intimacy with me as his jealous fearful temper suggested Austin who was in full confidence with him might give information now and then of  "The forbidden secrets of his prisonhouse"  He at length pacified Clive convinced her he was not concerned in the plot and hoped to  ee Austin afflicted with tortures for what she had suffered that night from his neglect to which she attributed her favourite offspring being strangled in the birth Mr Garrick even soothed her into tolerable temper by assuring her that her  arce was one of the most entertaining and best written pieces that had been produced for years her own acting had charmed him and he was mortified to think her misfortune in its disgrace was entirely  wing to the unparalleled bad behaviour of Austin Poor Joe was obliged to face his Master Garrick in a few days and I believe received from him a very severe lecture attended I conjecture with  a smarting fine he was also for some time banished the court of Drury and his Majesty o  Denmark's pre  ence but luckily for cunning Joseph Mr Garrick had interwoven his theatrical schemes and business so much with him that Garrick found he could not without inconceiveable inconvenience conduct his multiplicity of affairs without Joseph's transacting the secret services in the cabinet for Cross was grown old superannuated and unfit for his office as prompter c and on weighing the scales with Austin in one and his darling Interest with the Rupture in the other he found the balance was against himself he therefore with quick and wonted generosity graciously restored Austin to favour at court and reinstated him in all his honours and moveables of which he had been dispossessedFor two years he was really a slave to him nothing was right unless Austin was consulted and by way of amends he would often honour him by publicly walking with him arm in arm chatting laughing c with a small bribe for the day and a large promise for the morrow and I believe I may pronounce to a certainty he never in all his life made Mr Austin a genteel present or recompence for his trouble I have mentioned this on guess and if I am wrong in my assertion shall be happy to retract for I would not advance a falsehood fo  any advantage whatever and Mr Austin can easily in any newspaper contradict what I have asserted and inform us of Mr Garrick's generosity Mr Austin is an instance of one who some time glowed under the sunshinebeams of court favour yet with all his dependence on the great man in hopes of independence he never could obtain his wishes and expectations for like the Miser Joseph wanted to  "to touch something real"  but was only paid as Ramilie with forgiveness of all that had passed  At length wearied out Mr Austin was under the necessity of leaving his friends and country and seeking a refuge and asylum in Old Ireland He never more returned to his old master Garrick  Notwithstanding Mr Garrick's oddities I always did and shall reverence respect and esteem him as the greatest actor the British stage has ever known from its first establishment to the present day but in other points I have only given the picture as it should be from the life with all its spots blemishes and beauties so my conscience may rest as certainly if my narrative respecting his treatment of myself be true there remains no call of any trait of Mr Garrick from my pen but justice  In Dublin my old acquaintance Austin and I often met and since that time as late manager of the  Newcastle theatre but he has retired with ease an  plentyan enviable state Whenever we do mee  and want matter for conversation we need but recollect Portsmouth Mr Garrick Mrs Clive and othersand as Lady Townly says  "We can make the prettiest sherbet aye and without too much lemon"  and to conclude with her ladyship's words as to Austin and myself  "I believe in my soul it will last as long as we live"  Mr Garrick though attached to subordination was kept in order and decorum himself by our present ingenious writer Counsellor Murphy that gentleman could teaze his soul and gall his gizzard whenever he pleased or judged himself wronged Mr Macklin my master Garrick did not much love though formerly they were on a friendly footing but the Drury palace gates against his irony were fast closed When Barbarossa wrote by the late Dr Brown was produced Garrick the first night entered after the fourth act in a glittering silverspangled tissue shape when Mrs Clive instead of court adulation cried out  "O my God room room make room for the royal lamplighter"  which rudeness disconcerted him much for the remaining part of the evening and certainly it was too free and not well timed as he was tremblingly alive all over on the first night of a new part in a new play and it  ertainly is a serious matter in London and a service of danger  Before I arrived in town from Portsmouth for Shuter's benefit Mr Arthur manager of the Bath company came to that town on the plan of building a new theatre there as the inhabitants much wished for a better and more regular company of performers Mr Arthur waited on me wished me joy on the success of my two nights public  impromptu  at Portsmouth and as his friends who had encouraged his new undertaking wished to see me there again the ensuing summer he hoped it would turn out mutually agreeable and lucrative to himself and methe matter was settled and agreed between us He then made another proposal for my playing ten nights that spring season at Bath with a clear benefitthat was also agreed on and I left Portsmouth and got to London on Wednesday night March and on Thursday gave Tea as I had pro  ised for my friend Shuter's benefit and I may with great truth affirm with wonderful applause The approbation intoxicated me so much that the night following being in company with Shuter and Ballard the treasurer I consented to pour water on the leaves for his benefit early in May though I had engaged for Bath and knew I was  o incur the expence from thence to London and  back again but my desire for applause increased my thirst it went down so deliciously that I was glad to cover that as an obligation which in fact I was pleased to be requested to do and thought no price I could pay equal to public approbation I did not then so well know the fickle changes of Fortune as well as lifeWould I were young againBut let it goA foolish figure farewell it  I arrived at Bath well and without the least fatigue the next day I paid my respects to Mr Arthur also to Mr Ridout with a thousand compliments from Mr Rich who was unhappy at his illdeclining health calling him there and obliging him to quit CoventGarden theatre to which place he never more returned He was the only man in whom Mr Rich placed any confidence or whose advice he would listen to Mr Ridout being prime minister he was of course bespattered with plenty of abuse but he like me and Benedick cared not for a satire or an epigramfor if a man will let himself be beaten with brains he shall wear nothing handsome about him  Ridout was extremely glad to see me at Bath and when my benefit was advertised he sent me a letter desiring three box tickets and begged my acceptance of the inclosed three guineas with his  best wishes and thanks for having so honourably kept my promise in not to meddle with his manner of acting any night of my imitations at either of the London theatres The three guineas was meant it is true as a  dcuceur  and I had some t  tle to accept the cash and not return it for I c  rtainly had deprived myself of a credit as to the imitation and I pin my faith more on Mr Macklin's opinion than on my own merit for Mr Macklin when I last saw him declared I had taken such exact measure of Mr Ridout that my likeness of him was my masterpiece At Bath he diedWhen I saw him there he appeared in a weak languid state not in immediate danger  But who can controul his fate  I so flylike Mr Aircastle myself from one point to another that I can apologize but cannot help being incoherent  Bath was then certainly a pleasing spotNow I am told and it is well known that city has increased at an incredible rate of elegance to the astonishment and admiration of all Europe In that city Mr Keasberry treated me with my first dinner and I was particularly lucky by unexpectedly meeting with an unthoughof blessing for in a few hours after my name had been published o  Richard the Third I was surprised with the  agreeable pleasure of receiving cards from my ever dear remembered friends and patrons Mr and Mrs Chaigneau and Mrs Forbes and some others from Irelanda most happy intelligence indeed for me abstracted from interest Bath was at that time and still continues a place of constant fashionable and friendly resort of persons of quality and fortune from the kingdom of Ireland It was in truth a fortunate circumstance as they immediately introduced me not only to a genteel but fashionable resort of friends who were of the utmost service in fixing my reputation as a public performer amongst all the circle of their acquaintance besides the certain allowed credit convenience and selfsatisfaction on my Bath onset as an actor to have such eligible and esteemed places to dine at and be received as a particular friend and visitant at Mr Chaigneau's in Gaystreet and Mrs Forbes's in Queensquare c I played a variety of characters there and it would be tedious and fulsome to repeat the favours I received every person I knew consulted to make me happy My benefit was on Monday April Confederacy the play with Tea and the farce of the GuardianI acted Mrs Amlet and the Guardian with Tea and in the course of my playing I acted Richard Lear Hamlet and Shylockparts in the Minor Cadwallader Petruchio c  My benefit was honoured with so great a demand for places that the  whole pit was laid into the boxes  a circumstance which had not been often instanced A large party with the late Lord Clive were that night contented with places in the pit Indeed a theatre is such a strange place that the seat which is fashionable one night is horrid another for sometimes if only the first rows of the sideboxes are taken the cry is  "Not a place to be had in the boxes every seat is let"  The frontboxes if Mrs Siddons acts are called good places and acknowledged as they truly are to be the best seats in the house for seeing a play but on any night if not wishing to be at the theatre and yet wanting an excuse to stay away the cry is  "It is horridit is a boreWho can sit in the frontboxes those giblet pies  When my nights with Mr Arthur were expired I had engaged to perform Lady Pentweazle and Cadwallader for his benefit on Monday May but Mr Ballard the CoventGarden treasurer with Shuter's summons advertised me in the London papers according to my promise there  ore I could not be excused being so indispensably under an honourable contract to make my appearance in London and was obliged to quit Bath on Saturday May and took postchaise for the  urpose On Sunday noon I unexpectedly met a  party of friends at Hounslow where I spent a cheerful day and got safe to London in the evening and was ready to fulfil my duty and promised faith on Monday night Before I left Bath I had agreed to return the Thursday following May the th to perform for the benefit of Mr Keasberry  The Monday night I was in London I had not leisure to see any friend whatev  r but was pleasing myself with the thoughts of what vast and uncommon appl  use I should be favoured with the next night for my honeydraught on Shuter's benefit had bee  a great inducement for my incurring the expence of such a post journey I have often heard Mr Foote declare that the change of weather had an effect upon the tempers of the audiences and also to a certainty it acted differently with the performers as to their spirits c The truth of these o  servations I cannot take upon me to determine but leave it to the doctors and wiser heads Every frequenter of a theatre must have at times been insensibly led to observe that with the same actors in the same piece and in the same theatre the reception whether it was the weather the audience or their own dulness has been widely opposite If the audience is not in humour the performer let him go on in his best spirits will flag but on the contrary if the  audience is in great good humour and the players flat and insipid they will catch the fire like electricity and though the performers went on the stage even in bad health and spirits they will be transformed and all alert forget their illness be  new vigoured  become what each wishes to personate in the assumed character  Each bosom's lord sits lightly on its throne  And all that night an unaccustomed spirit  Lifts them above the ground with cheerful thoughts  So I on the day of Ballard's benefit like Mrs Heidleburgh longed for the rencounter and was as usual well received and I was determined to get applause by giving much more in quantity than what I had done for Shuter's benefitan ignorant zeal that like Shakspeare's Dogberry had it been ten times more I would have bestowed all my tediousness on their Worships But alas alas before I had gone half a stage with my  ic lecture  my numerous auditory appeared to be sleepy and tired Now whether it was as Mr  had observed the weather the drowsiness  f the audience or from what other chain of  I cannot tell but I rather believe it was  ing to a jumble of bad materials with a dou  e quantity of my own insipidity intermixed One  cumstance I re  ember perfectly which was I  thought it would never have been over without Supernatural Aid or a ghost to tell me soand I am certain my hearers thought so too But as it is often said  "It is a long lane that has no turning"  so at last the conclusion did come and two or three friends at the lower end of the hall gave a hand or two the upper part of the building I believe gave a different kind of token therefore I did not take the vantage of those few at the lower end and stay to cry  "Thanks gentle citizens and friends c"  but even then took off and made my exit  Ballard's benefit was composed of all sorts of the lower order of people from every distant quar  er of London the greatest part of whom perhaps did not see three plays in a year and my imitations were as little understood by the redcloaked ladies in the frontboxes as when I gave Tea at Norwich in fact it was as Hamlet says  "  Caviare  to the multitude"  So I poor Pilgarlick had treated myself with a postchaise jaunt of one hundred miles from Bath to London and to return back and all for a bill which my vanity had drawn upon the bank of Folly the which had no stability and was not fit to be trusted as it was protested and returned back on my hands to my own shame and disgrace This is truebut not  without a good lesson for young people's improvement and future observationand I consoled myself with never in future playing at hazard for the chance of applause only without the pecunia where there were such odds against me I returned to Bath and was on the stage on Thursday May on Mr Keasberry's night and when there had plenty of Spawwater very easily purchased to quench my thirst for applause when I wanted more than I deservedNot but the longing desire of applause is a good incentive to excite spirit and emulation in every young performer for without ambition few would encounter such various and almost insurmountable difficulties as attend a theatre I remember Miss Nossiter's saying in the greenroom that all of the theatrical profession should be blessed with more than common philosophy That we should possess that said serenity I agree to be a right observation but am far from thinking we are in any great degree honoured with its attendanc  as a constant companion in general we have something like an equivalent and that is great spirits which glides over little misfortunes evil tongues and disappointments easier than with mankind in general and good spirits create ease and happiness and like death and the dice levels all distinctions  who would bear the whips and scorns of the time  The oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely  And  Merit of th' unworthy takes  While at Bath I was solicited to perform for almost every benefit I most willingly complied and  ted away most furiously without fee or reward so was in no danger of suffering on the vag    The two last plays were Hamlet and Richard the Third the first for the benefit of Mr Williames termed the  Ancient Carpenter  on Friday June and the last for Mr Wooley the painter Monday June The farce was  Hob in the Will  in which Mr Wooley appeared in the character of  Hob  The reason for my being so particular as to the days months and years on trifles not worth doubting is that it helps as a reference to the professed plan with which I set out and to make good my assertions with those now living who might think it worth while either to corroborate or contradict my relation of facts with the strictest observance of time and place  From thence I lounged at Winchester until the new theatre at Portsmouth building under Mr Arthur's inspection was ready for the reception of the Bath Company at that time under his direction where I resorted according to beat of  drum and marching orders on the st of July but when I saw the desolate state of the building I judged it impracticable for its wide extended walls to have a play enacted that good year of our Lord However Arthur was indefatigable slow and sure and in so short a time as Monday July  Hamlet  was announced for opening our new theatre with the farce of the ContrivancesHamlet Mr Wilkinson Polonius Mr Arthur Ho  atia Mr Keasberry the Queen Mrs Lee  Mrs Lee was wife to the late Mr Lee and mother to the present Miss Lees of Bath One wrote the pleasant comedy of the Chapter of Accidents and the other that entertaining and welldrawn romance of the Recess Mr Lee was well known in London as an actor of merit at DruryLane and CoventGarden also as manager and performer at Edinburgh and Bath But some dispute had happened about a year before I was at Bath between Mr Lee and Mr Palmer the Bath proprietor which not being amicably settled Mr Lee withdrew but she very sensibly not having given any cause for complaint desired to be retained  Our new grand theatre at noon on the th of July had not the least appearance of being fit to be opened that night either before or behind the curtainthe whole company were of that  opinion But great men will overcome obstacles and the wonderworking incomparable Arthur despised difficulties At twelve o'clock at noon there was not one seat in the pit but he actually contrived to get it finished by seven Not any rehearsal was possible as the stage was up to one's waist in shavings The populace were eager to see the new playhouse new company and the first acted play but on traversing the streets from four till seven and no admittance they became very noisy the sailors particularly unruly when into the street popped our old cross commander in chief Admiral Arthurnot like his advertised character of Polonius but more resembling one of the witches in Macbeth for he had on an old round flapped hat a woman's checked apron with a large broom in his hand and his face as begrimed and greasy as a barnacting Othello in the Dogdays He harangued the multitude high and low and humbly beseeched their patience while himself and the hardlaboured carpenters assisted in sweeping the shavings out of the pit and gallery He received a good hooting with a laugh and retired to make his words good by deeds and Hecatelike he sweated and swept most violently till the word without was given as their impatience was beyond bounds the doors were burst open the witch and her stick were thrown down and rolled  over and over the broom had no other charms or spells than to assist the cripple to hobble out and escape with all possible expedition there were no persons ready or offices fixed to take the money so each sailor and his lass or his companion and others seated themselves in such places as suited their fancies But Arthur to shew his humbleness acted as a wary and careful manager for without putting off his apron as soon as the house had filled and all were a little quiet and seated in the midst of a cloud of dust he doffed his old brown hat and went profoundly round the theatre to collect in it from every part what he could either by threats or civility obtain some did pay others did not and some only what they pleased nor would he have stirred till twelve at night whilst he beheld the glimpse of another dropping shilling to have paid for their forciblyobtained footing When he had finished that difficult job he retired to what was absolutely requisite soap and sand and in about an hour more the hour of nine we proceeded on with our solemnity Mr Arthur was transformeda long old periwig and a sumptuous suit of clothes gracing his person for Polonius a part which he had often performed in London and acted truly well but the lamps and candles having been loaded with the immensity of our kindred dust from Hecate the manager's  outrageous sweepings had occasioned such a mist and violent heat on the audiencepart of the theatre on the stage behind the scenes and had dispersed such an universal melancholy gloom as I never can forgetevery one of the performers and the wellwarmed nay I may say nearly parched spectators became reflectors of burning  eat to each other and were almost literally s  orched on that night's dangerous undertaking For my own part I judged I should make my exit as a great man being no less a personage than the Prince of Denmark and recollecting the old women's adage that  a man must swallow a peck of dust  r  he dies  I concluded my time was come as I  y my own suggestion fancied I must that night have g  ped that  ata  quantityhowever it is evident I survived that suffocation In three or four nights after our little theatre was really an elegant wellapproved and fashionable place of resort far different from what the families of Portsmouth had ever  then  experienced in point of grandeur comfort or regularity or as a respectable company of comedi  ns  Indeed I do not suppose Mr Arthur would have opened the theatre in this strange inconvenient and contemptu  us condition but from a particular circumstance which was that the th of July  d on to the Portsmouth annual mart a week of  general resort for all sorts of people that assembled yearly to purchase toys ribands flippets c therefore had he lost that advantage he would have missed the capital prize in his theatrical lottery It was still the time not only of hostility with France but an honourable successful and as glorious a war as any the British annals can boastthough as to war at Portsmouth the creed of the inhabitants is easily understood by the words of Kate Matchlock in the Funeral who says  "O rare news we are going to have a war and a war's a war no matter whether abroad or at home"  So in fact  war  is the only manufactory of Portsmouth and PlymouthAnd of course that war continuing added much to our good fortune and was the happy work of more lucky  hances We were soon opposed by the old Plymouth company of comedians at the old theatre the ragged regiment I have so often mentioned but their theatre was so dirty their conduct so irregular that they were generally viewed as a vulgar dramdrinking set when compared to our decent demeanour and truly creditable appearance therefore we were honourably termed the  quality company  Our house had many advantages not only as to elegance but was more commodious and cool with good wardrobe scenery c  My night was on Monday September and was greatly attended as a proof I believe it was the best in our whole successful season  Tamerlane  with the  Upholsterer  I acted Bajazet the first scene of Sir Archy Bucks have at ye All with Pamphlet and Razor  Our campaign ended without any particular occurrences on Monday October with Henry VIII and the Coronation It was acted two nights after the benefits were over Wol  ey Wilkinson Gardiner Arthur Cranmer Keasberry Henry Stephens the buttonmaker once famous as Othello in London Anna Bullen Miss Reynolds late Mrs Saunders who acted the Country Girl when it was altered at Mr Garrick's desire some years ago by Mr Bickerstaff Queen Katherine Mrs Baker  Mrs Baker was a woman of strong understanding aided by a good and highly finished education wonderful natural abilities and an actress of great capacity and she had performed three or four parts at CoventGarden where they could not deny she possessed much merit her features were very good but her figure was short clumsey and against her in many parts which otherwise she was well calculated for If a line had been drawn of competitorship the first of that or the present day would have shrunk in the debate as to  comprehension  and real understanding and yielded to her courtesey Use is of greater importance than the London or any other audience are aware ofMrs Pritchard was a striking instance who with a large figure was esteemed the best Rosalind though Mrs Woffington the beautiful was her opponentPrejudice for some time prevailed much against Mrs Baker at York where she acted during the races in August and one winter but at the latter part of the season she surmounted those prejudices At Edinburgh where she resided some years she was in universal esteem as an actress but on a quarrel with Mr Digges for her temper was soon ruffled and she was too apt to rush into the different ex  remes of love and hate she hastily quitted the stage and there undertook the difficult task of teaching the English pronunciation for which she was not only capable but thoroughly qualified In so doing she received great promises and what was better great emoluments all which increased instead of being diminished She was received as a guest of knowledge and entertaining liv  ly conversation at the first tables in Edinburgh which honours at that city would never without talents have been conferred Her last performance at Portsmouth was in Queen Katherine  The coronation to Henry VIII had double effect  from being well timed his present Majesty King George III having been crowned on Tuesday Sept On that day most of the Hampshire world assembled for those that could not be in London flocked to Portsmouth and there beheld at noon a glorious sight indeed several of our noblest ships of war dressed in their colours all the officers of their separate denominations decked out in their full uniforms and every person both high and low in their holiday clotheswhilst all the cannon from the ramparts and shipping as also  rom the castle on SouthSea Common were echoing and re echoing resounding thunder with such a delightful confusion of noise as Sir Callaghan O Brallaghan says that I can no more attempt to give an account of it than to tell the stars in the sky That heavenly sight was greatly heightened by the additional illumination of Apollo who had mounted his fiery steeds and the sun beamed most brilliantly and hai  ed one of the most auspicious and splendid days that ever blessed our nation Almost every reader knows that the prospect from the ramparts at Portsmouth to the Isle of W  ght is one of the most delightful in the kingdom The coronation being the general topic added not a little to curiosity and attraction for our Henry VIII on that evening and the play was highly approved by a full audience  I must not omit before I quit Hampshire to mention that early in August Mr Lee had hired a banditti set of actors to perform at Winchester every Saturday for a few weeks a camp being there but far inferior to the encampment I before described the preceding year but I agreed on such nights to accompany Mrs Lee he paying the carriage for two days the Saturday and Sunday and to have a clear benefit which engagement he punctually fulfilled but we differed about some trifle and did not part friends Mr Lee was very fond of teaching to act with which he amused himself from Saturday to Saturday with almost as thin a company as Gibbet's in the Beaux StratagemI am sure it did not double itThe salaries the reader may be sure were poor as Winchester with the little camp could not afford great expences so as to procure Mr Lee a living and the additional charges of my going there with Mrs Lee yet Mr Lee being known as an actor of merit the officers were pleased and obliged to him for their Saturday's lounge and made it a point to do all in their power to support himMr Lee would not lead off the first playI believe he was really afraid his spirits being dashed as whose would not like Falstaff who says  "If I be not ashamed of my soldiers I am a soused gu    et"  The first play was on Saturday August There was not any thing appeared to Lee to be so practicable as my doing the parts in the Minor so the Minor was fixed on without any other entertainment whatever and it was acted from necessity in a very mutilated state as it was impossible the people Mr Lee had so suddenly and with difficulty collected could be perfect in the intermediate scenes where I was not concerned However a very genteel house appeared of Mr Lee's patrons and I was well received as their old favourite acquaintance having been there a whole campaign the year before with the Bath company so from consideration to Mr Lee and myself they went away in perfect good humour professed themselves pleased and satisfied with their short entertainment  August we acted the Fair Penitent Mr Lee had amused himself with drilling his troops and the play had one great claim to being well received as it was very perfect Lothario Mr Lee Horatio Mr Wilkinson Lavinia Mrs Burden who had acted Charlotte in Love AlaMode at CoventGarden and the lady I have so often mentioned as the  infernal

have at ye All and the favourite scene of Sir Archy Mac Sarca  m from Love AlaModeto a very noble audience which may be easily accounted for not only as a reward for the trouble I had undergone of performing added to the journies but from my established acquaintance with the gentlemen of the army as well as with the particular inhabitants of Winchester the preceding year After the hard duty I had sustained of marching and counter marching from stage to stage and the business universally heavy on me at Portsmouth garrison no wonder if I wished to indulge a few weeks autumn repose with that best good physician my mother who  was certainly not only my truest but most agreeable friend After a few days r  st I visited my old master Mr Rich who had some weeks before ordered Mr Ballard the treasurer to write me a letter of invitation and that I was expected by his manager to be in London by the th of September the opening time of the London theatres with an offer of l per week and to be ready in the character of Bayes and to sign an article for three years benefits included in the proposal My engagement with Mr Arthur rendered a compliance with honour or any degree of honesty impossible My nonattendance much offended Mr Rich as he thought and very justly he had made me a very genteel and comfortable offer but after I had two or three times attended his mornings levee we became as good friends as ever He even condescended to request a favour which was that I would make my first appearance in a farce which he told me secretly in confidence was of his own writing and I have reason to believe it was and that it will not be eagerly contradicted or claimed on account of its bequeathed honours to posterity It was called the Spirit of Contradiction He said if I would but act the part of the Gardener from his  larning  it would make my fortune  provided  I would implicitly yield to his instructions I had by that  grown so familiarized to Mr Rich's oddities that I unfeignedly held him in great regard and esteem and in the true sense of the word believe he was a worthy and respectable gentleman for tho' I well remembered he pronounced a very unfavourable opinion of me some years before when I was really distressed yet in our after serious acquaintance I often experienced many acts of kindness good wishes and cordiality which fully made me amends and my former seeming ill luck had made me often read the book called Experience Too  ten neglected in all stages of life for the prevention of errors which lead to misfortunes  When I spoke of the Gardener for Mr Shuter who was the Edwin of the time instead of myself he took his snuff stroaked his cat and said  "If I give it  Muster Shuttleworth  he will not let me teach him and he is so idle I want it perfect  Muster Williamskin  but I will  larn  you  Muster  if you will play the part from my tuition  We were one noon hard at work with the part of the Gardener when Mr Younger the prompter abruptly came into the room on urgent and immediate stage stateaffairs Rich perceiving him turned hastily about and in a rage said  "Get away  Muster Youngmore  I am teaching  Muster Whittington  to act"  If questioned why I have spoken of Mr Rich so respectfully yet draw such a caricature I answer  my obligations to him at first were not those of a good kind that I altered my opinion by having notions superior to prejudice and as a true drawing of character without giving tints of these oddities strangers would have no true notion of Mr Rich's real manner and personal oddities And I wish every writer good or bad never dealt in more satire or intention of doing harm than my insignificant self Indeed Mr Rich's peculiarities are not here observed as a novelty for his best friends then and those who now remain cannot but say the relation is not more whimsical than true  When I had undergone six days lessons and repeated the Gardener line by line and to the best my ear could conduct me Mr Rich said  "No engagement with his  larning  me unless confirmed by an article signed for three years"  Now I had been so weary of Mr Garrick's tyranny and above all loved to ramble and was so habituated to get money and be my own master that I could not by any means relish the least idea of bondage for being at liberty exclusive of the profit seemed doubly pleasant and alluring So in short after a pause with hesitation and finding I could not gulp down an article I frankly told him my disposition but that I was notwithstanding at his command on his profered terms for  ten weeks only whereat my old master grew angry I turned sullen and our interview concluded as follows  Mr Rich  So you will not sign your article  Muster Williamskin  and let me  larn  you  Mr Wilkinson  No SirArticles may be repented on both sides and I would rather agree for a shorter term and renew if mutually agreeable  Mr Rich  Why then  Muster Williamskin  what will you do for  Muster Griskin  Mr Garrick told me in the summer he would  n  ver  engage you again you have offended him  Muster  and he will never forgive you and  Muster Williamskin  you did not attend my theatre when summoned and I not only made you a liberal offer but endeavoured to be the making of you by  larning  you to act  Mr Wilkinson  My good Sir I am truly obliged to you for your offers but must repeat I do not relish a confined engagementRather than be under an article for three years I would prefer rambling for six therefore good Sir with my sincere thanks and wishes unless you will agree for ten weeks I mean to set  ail in a few days for Ireland  His astonishment and answer I shall never forget though his prophecy was not in respect to myself verified yet I have reason to fear some adventurers  possessed of too much faith in promises woefully experienced real disappointment  Mr Rich sternly  Muster Williamskin  I'll  ell you what will be the consequence of your headstrong ignorance you will go over to Dublin and engage with the tall man  Muster Barlymore  he will promise you a large salary of which you will not receive a second guinea for that  Muster Barlymore  can wheedle a bird from the tree and squeeze it to death in his hand  This was a severe caricature of Barry but shrewd and too near a resemblance    Muster Williamskin  here is five guineas as a ticket for your Irish benefit that you may be sure of something I wish you a good journeyyour servant He left the room in a pet and the five guineas in my hand and though I was no lawyer I was not so ignorant as not to retain the fee and that was my last visit and conversation with the  really good Mr Rich  He died soon after during the run of his splendid coronation  The day before the fracas happened I had received a letter of pressing invitation from Mr Mossop then manager of SmockAlley theatre in Dublin That unexpected treaty could not have been brought about after Mossop's declared aversion had it not been for the willing interference of Counsellor Barrett That gentleman had a  strong partiality for Mr Mossop as a friend and an actor they had been bred I understood at college together which lasting intimacy induced Mr Barrett to be ever ready to contribute towards conciliation and acts of kindness for the which I doubt he suffered very considerably tho' willingly by frequently encroaching on his own substantial finances to the generously assisting Mossop with material sums at times when bewildered and plunged in his fatal airy scheme of being an opposing manager which too frequently occasioned various occurrences and disasters at different periods for which generous benevolence I fear the friendly hearted Counsellor never had a chance or possibility of being reimbursed however he was affluent and did not want money but the  istressed actor unhappily did I relate this from conjecture only never having been on a footing of intimacy with Mr Barrett to enable me to vouch for its authenticity though infinitely obliged to him in Ireland in  for many civilities which I am ever pleased to acknowledge likewise his being instrumental to the bringing me and Mr Mossop on terms of amity once more in but that governour of restless players was not by any means blessed with a tythe of Mr Barry's pleasing abilities as an actor or generous qualities as a man or manager Mr Barry had certainly  a most enchanting fascination beyond the general lot of mankind as a proof it was seldom either creditor or  enemy  left Barry in an ill humour however in other respects dissatisfied or disappointed Mr Mossop was overloaded with a quantity of combustibles consisting of pride insolence arrogance and gall I reviewed the difference as to the respective managers but Mossop's offer claimed a priority of preference as being the first and that offer was liberal The reader will think it strange that Mossop should have any engagement with me after his declarations but he judged I suppose it was better policy to keep such a mischievous monkey in his own theatre where he might play his tricks at the expence of the enemy than suffer pug to be at the opposite one and be let loose upon himself He wrote me word I might depend on every friendship in his power to render his theatre agreeable and insinuated that after his generous persentation he trusted I would not deal so unlike a gentleman when I arrived in Dublin as to enter or listen to any terms whatever as to engaging with Barry and Woodward which I assented to On my arrival Mr Mossop and I soon settled all preliminaries it was early in January and a few days after Christmas holidays My first appearance was in the  play  of the Minor which two years before  had been damned as a  farce  it would have been hazardous but its being insinuated and advertised with a pompous account of the amazing run and success it had met with at all the three theatres in London not omitting to mention considerable alterations which by so doing obtained a verdict in favour of seeing and hearing it acted And as Mr Foote has been mentioned to have observed the difference of weather humours and various accidents that make for and against to render it impossible to account for the uncertain changes in theatrical events so the Minor was acted to a very fine house received with universal applause and continued to be performed twice aweek to good houses  My imitation of Mrs Bellamy in Shift with the Introduction the Puppets and a Mock Burletta Imitation c were of great service The Minor was well supported as may be perceived by the following castI acted Mr Foote's characters the Minor Mr Jefferson Mr Wealthy Mr Sowden Sir William Mr Baddely Loader Mr RyderLucy Mrs Kelf In that theatre I met with my agreeable friend Mrs Abington in high estimation she did not see her old friend Tate with a new face She had grown weary of being connected with Barry and Mrs Dancer as the latter could not relish the triumph of  Miss Notable nor could Miss Notable patiently submit to the insolence and affected superiority of Mrs Conquest My agreeable acquaintance Mrs Kelf now Mrs Egerton with her mother and sister were at Mossop's theatre and if this book falls into her hands she will laugh very heartily on recollecting the many happy days and whimsical adventures which occurred that winter in dear Dublin Whenever I remember the happiness I there experienced and the numerous obligations I received in that city I sigh and languish for another peep ere I depart to meet my many good friends of great Britain and Ireland which have gone before me to that country  from whose bourne no traveller returns  Mr Mossop and myself for the first three weeks were on the most intimate footing I dined twice with him at Dr Wilson's apartments in Trinity College he was a staunch friend of Mossop's I believe the Smockally theatre was Dr Wilson's property These dinners I surmised were intended to induce me by their mutual rhetoric and persuasion to attack Barry and Woodward but that I declined from policy For I prophetically judged it most likely that this sudden apparent friendship would not be of very long duration as I knew in his heart he hated me so the foundation which I depended on his good will was very  ak and frivolous and when he wanted to be quit of me I should have shut Barry's doors against my sweet self However I proposed over our claret to take great pains with Woodward's favourite character of the Barber and he might advertise my name for it in the manner of the original which seemed to please Mossop much a plain proof how we relish satire against others and how little we allow for it against ourselves It was immediately brought forward  The next day after being with Mr Mossop I waited on the attractive Abington and importuned her assistance in Termagant which she good naturedly complied with She was at that juncture of time in her full bloom and prime of life she has had her dayMiss Farren now has her day and she I hope will live like the French beauty Madam Ninon de l'Enclos who captivated her son by her charms when she was at the age of seventy  I told Mrs Abington I should revive the Jealous Wife for my night if she would favour me with playing Mrs Oakley she consented to study it against the d of February Indeed she that winter as well as in paid me great civilities and I never received a favour in my life that I was not grateful for and ever ready and proud to acknowledge It was surprising that so truly good a comedy should have been in print  two winters and not brought forward properly at either of the Dublin theatres We acted the Author three or four nights and it was commanded by their Graces the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland his Grace was at that time the Lord Lieutenant The Upholsterer was often repeated and I was esteemed so very like Woodward in the part by my having so exactly copied his manner and dress that I do not believe Colley Cibber's relation of his likeness of Dogget in Fondlewi  e was in truth beyond my exact representation of Woodward in the Barber Lady Pentweazle also helped to make out my twelve nights with the repeating the successful comedy of the Jealous Wife in which I acted Mr Oakley That year early in March both the tragedy candidates Barry and Mossop had fixed on performing Othello on the same Monday for their benefit play Mossop relying on his novelty Barry on his longestablished reputation the partisans prepared for battle bets ran high and furious as in the present days for pugilism Mossop's holder of the stakes was the Countess of Brandon heavy in demeanour but alert in apprehension Her l  dyship solicited his Grace the Duke of Northumberland to command Mossop's night to which he generously assented but wisely contrived to occasion a cessation of hostilities between  he two combatants by promising to Barry that provided he would postpone his night to the Tuesday he would also command that evening's entertainment by which means the town would be kept in good humour the particular friends of each rest satisfied and his Grace also added he should by such attention and compliance from Mr Barry not be deprived the pleasure of seeing him in his favourite character of Othello which always afforded him the highest satisfactionBarry of course complied and was not inwardly displeased that the critics without a division would have such an immediate opportunity to compare notes on the skill and superiority of the declared opponents On this remarkable occasion each house was equally thronged though Barry's on the Tuesday was the greatest receipt as Crowstreet was capable of containing more than Smockalley otherwise party zeal added to curiosity raised auditors in such superabundance as would have filled DruryLane and CoventGarden theatres As to victory Barry's Othello was so meritorious as to make Mossop's viewed at a distance only he was as much superior in the valiant Moor as Mossop would have been to Barry in Richard or Zanga I sat the evening of Mossop's benefit in an upper box where a lady who sat next me exclaimed on Mossop's first appearance with  an archness and humour peculiar to that nation  "O faith Mossop has got two eyes in his belly"  This shrewd remark was occasioned by his wearing a heavy embossed shape fit for Brutus or Cato a dragon's face on the breast with two large glaring red stones for the eyes his face and wig being black conveyed exactly what the lady had so ironically expressed Mr Barry though masterly that night of controversy had frequently shewn himself to more advantage merely owing to his then taking too great pains in his favourite and much esteemed part which proves that lucky accidents fortunately combined with nature will perchance strike out more beauties for an artist than all the most determined force of premeditation  Mr Mossop that year had an Italian opera company which was of infinite service to him but astonishingly hurt his own consequence for what with parties and other diversions of routs assemblies concerts c with which Dublin in the winter abounds and opposed by the forces of Woodward and Barry for they still maintained their fashion and good report the great box nights were chiefly confined to those of the burlettas That agreeable singer and actress  Signora De Amicé  was the principal and was almost adored she after that greatly succeeded at the opera house in London as the first serious woman singer  These Italian comic operas were all the rage and were supported at the following pricesboxes pit and lattices s dmiddle gallery s dupper gallery s d Dublin was then torn to pieces by the perpetual application for one theatre or the other it was reduced quite to a party matter The Countess of Brandon would not be seen at Crowstreet upon any account but attended constantly at her dear Mossop's Barry I believe had at least converted the ladies two to one in his favour Barry's making love when on the stage left tender impressions but yet this playbegging at last grew troublesome and ended with fatal circumstances of which an exact account has before been given  Mossop when he had a good house instead of endeavouring to extricate himself in any degree from his multiplicity of difficulties grew desperate and instead of paying either his tradesmen or performers flew to the gay circles where he was gladly admitted and in order to mend his broken fortune by the chance of a die or the turn up of a card of which I believe he was ignorant and unacquainted with the necessary arts to succeed He has often left the theatre with a hundred guineas in his pocket and returned home with an aching head and heart but his guineas with debts of honour were all left behind The Countess  of Brandon served him greatly it is true but often the money she occasioned being paid at the theatre returned to her own coffers This was the universal opinion of Dublin and is all I can alledge in that case as to its authenticity and as to Mossop's poverty there needs no evidence for that unfortunate reality  This conduct and a train of evils attendant thereon soon preyed upon his health involved his talents with himself and gave bitter sours to that temper which was in its natural source far from being one of the best An instance of the poverty his performers were reduced to in I will with permission relate  The Distressed Mother was to be actedOrestes Mr Mossop Andromache by Mrs Burden whom I have so often mentioned The salaries had not been paid for several weeks and she was in true character as the distressed  woman  With infinite difficulty she forced access to the General Mossop for it was hard to accomplish admittance on account of many inconvenient reasons unless on a Sunday and on that grand leveeday performers and tradesmen were too menial to be admitted But with the force of a heroine who dauntless surmounts all barriers and tyrants at will so Mrs Burden burst into the  "inmost recess of his prison house"  and when arrived at the royal hall she was as determined to preserve characterfor  at the awful voice of Mossop she Andromachelike was prostrate at the feet of her royal master and uttered forth in tragic tones  "O Sir for God's sake assist me I have not bread to eat I am actually starving and shall be turned out into the streets"  Mossop In state  Womanyou have five pounds per week woman  Mrs Burden  True Sir But I have been in Dublin six months and in all that time have only received six poundsI call every Saturday at the office for my salarybut no money is the answer besides Sir your credit and your honour is at stake how can I play Andromache the Trojan Queen without black satin shoes  Mossop  Woman begone I insist on your having black satin shoes for Andromache And woman if you  dare  ask me for money again I will forfeit you  pounds womanSo ended that real tragical scene of penury and pomposity  My benefit that year Feb was as usual very great indeed it could not be better My play as before related was the Jealous WifeOakley with a prologue of Garrick's Mr Wilkinson Major Oakley Mr Baddely Lord Trinket Mr Jefferson Charles Mr Reed Russet Mr Heaphy Sir Harry Mr Ryder Capt O'Cutter Mr SparksLady Freelove Miss Kennedy Harriet Miss Macartney Mrs Oakley Mrs  Abington With Tea Bucks have at ye All and the farce of the Country House  My engagement with Mossop being expired I intended soon leaving my old favourite spot which was now become a home but was detained by Mrs Abington's requesting I would stay and assist her in a scene of fun and humour for her benefit night which she had complied with at the request of her really good benefactor Lord Miltown Mrs Abington had often entertained several genteel parties with some droll stories of a good gentlewoman she named Mrs Fuz I had been on parties with Lord Miltown and Lord Clambrazil when in high spirits and good humour and had diverted myself and the company with stories and anecdotes of my dear favourite old lady Mrs White of whom the reader must by this time have formed some idea by referring back to what I have before related of my darling old gentlewoman's singularities  Mrs Abington had promised Lord Miltown she would produce herself as Mrs Fuz and she would prevail on her friend Wilkinson to do the same as Mrs Jenkins alias Mrs White which information his Lordship made known to all families of distinction in Dublin but the peer did not reflect that those stories told by myself  Mrs Abington over the convivial table gave a kind of explanatory key to the strange characters  and Sir Francis Delaval and Mr Foote knew the mother and the daughters as well as myself but on a stage where few of the audience were acquainted either with the character that Mrs Abington or I represented the joke was as difficult to find out as Mr Bayes's laughing violently at his own Prince Volscius where the joke lay in the bootsHer play was Rule a WifeLeon Mr Mossop Copper Captain Mr BrownEstifania Mrs Abington Between the play and farce an interlude called Mrs Jenkins and Mrs Fuz Mrs Jenkins Mr Wilkinson Mrs Fuz Mrs Abington Before the night came we often entertained ourselves with extempore rehearsals and conceived ourselves easy perfect and entertaining Mrs Jenkins was dressed before the play concluded Mrs Abington after an epilogue of shrewd turn and spoke with great point retired to dress as Mrs Fuz our dresses had been before well consideredIt was a crowded house part of the pit laid into the boxes Mrs Abington had ordered an excellent supper superbly lighted c and had wrote a little introductory dialoguescene in the street between two gentlemen giving a description of a party they were that night invited to and where two extraordinary characters were asked for the entertainmentof the lady's guests at whose house the rendezvous was appointed but each person was enjoined  to lay their fingers on their lips and not to laugh on any account whatever but to pay every mark of attention and approbation in order that the two ladies might with more unlimited freedom display their different absurdities After the dialogue was finished the scene was drawn up and discovered several welldressed ladies and gentlemen at supperMiss Ambrose was sitting at my elbow as the daughter of Mrs Jenkins who intended bringing her on the stageMrs Fuz was seated at one front corner of a long supper table and I was at the other Mrs Kelf was at the head as lady of the ceremonies which was the only good part for there were the servants with wine and she displayed on the occasion her being mistress of a good knife and fork On being discovered and looking scornfully at each other our two figures had for some time a fine effect loud fits of laughter succeeded and from these great expectations were formed  Mrs Fuz then desired Mrs Jenkins to beginMrs Jenkins desired Mrs Fuz would do the sameand we found ourselves in an aukward situation But after a few efforts the two ladies entered into a hobbling short conversation which was received very well from the eager opinion that something better would follow for the audience were all eyes and ears but we soon flagged Mrs Fuz asked for a glass of winesays Mrs Jenkins  upond  my  sould  and I will have a glass of  wind  too Then Mrs Fuz said when she was first married her two  breasteses  were so large you might have carried a plate of salt upon themThat did not do and the Abington began to feel it a service of danger perplexity and disgraceMrs Jenkins called to her daughter to act Juliet and observe her manner and to stick herself upon the stage as if she was chilled and stabbed  throfout  But as she kneeled down to act Juliet the strange old lady Mrs Fuz got up gave her a kick ran away and abandoned Mrs Jenkins to the mercy of the audience I was well aware of what might be expected and therefore lost no time but arose and ran after her crying out  "Mrs Fuz Mrs Fuz"  The audience began to smoke the joke and by their tokens of anger gave the necessary hint to the staring ladies and gentlemen on the stage that a retreat would not be imprudent if they regarded their safety so they ran away also which caused a laugh for it was evident when Mrs Abington and I had eloped they were ignorant what to do not knowing but that we meant to return for they were only desired to  tay on till we finished which the performers could not conceive would be so abruptly as we made it but expected us to come back and make a conclusion to our characters  I hope Mrs Abington has not forgot this but will laugh at it as I do though it was truly aukward at the time and it really drew Lord Miltown into disgrace for he had said so much in favour of the promised scene that it had been the conversation of the preceding week  When the curtain dropped which was with loud marks of censure the ladies universally arose and by way of joke laughed and courtesied to each other saying  "Your servant Mrs Jenkins your servant Mrs Fuz  which I dare say vexed his Lordship much not only for his own and the disappointment of the audience but more so as any failure of Mrs Abington's was mortifying to him for he was then and I am told is now a most violently attached and true patron and wellwisher of hers Mrs Abington in her epilogue after Estifania had spoke some lines very sarcastically aimed at Mr Woodward who to speak truth deserved it at her hands they were very severe and her being so great a favourite and delivering them most excellently in Woodward's manner stung him to the quick Indeed he was so much irritated by her arch exhibition that it put a stop to my intended sail for England and was the occasion of an intimacy between hi  and me as till then it had so happened that I had never met with spoke to or hardly seen Mr Woodward  ut in his profession on the stage He directed my old acquaintance Joseph Austin to call on me with an invitation to supper the Sunday night fol  owing my great performance united with Mrs  bington's which I could not refuse as I had  n impulse I may add to be acquainted with a gentleman of such merit as an actor and a worthy and valuable character as a man  Mr Austin introduced me on the Sunday evening and supposing s  cr  ts of state we  e no  to be di  ulged left us to a roast fowl and mincepies with the help of two bottles of claret to grow wise  nd intimate for with an Englishman the second bottle is absolutely necessary for those purposes though I know by long experience not so salutary for the health Mr Woodward paid me the compliment of saying he wished to be on a foot  ng of intimacy hoped I would become his real friendly acquaintance and make his table my own while I remained in Dublin when at leisure or not particularly engaged and further said at that time he kept not any company for the manner of living in Dublin was too freeMrs Woodward was on her dying bed and a friend in that situation would be his only comfort pleasure and satisfaction to pass away a dreary hour  From that night we formed an acquaintance and he offered me twenty guineas for playing  four nights and a clear one for my benefit I urged with truth that I feared a second benefit would fail especially as I had been honoured with so many great ones and that my friends in particular would not like it which was really the case Woodward urged in pall  ation that was his reason for offering me twenty guineas and he would not advise me to trouble or think of my friends attendance so lately called on but inform them I did not exp  ct th  ir app  arance again on that occasion and added as you are on the spot you had better continue five or six weeks and if the receipt is but indifferent it will be taking so much without trouble This seemed feasibleI liked Dublinand as it suited my inclination and was practicable I consented and I believe we had a third bottle as a signing the contract Woodward I must observe was a sober man to a degree not fond of parties but liked to chat with a friend and over a bottle he would often stretch a point I was enlisted once more in the same regiment with Joseph AustinThe first night I played there was a very fine house Kitely in Every Man in his Humour which character from some cause or another had been wanting from the two seasons of Mossop's departure Bobadil by the  only  Bobadil of present memory Mr Woodward and with Buck in the Englishm  n  returned srom Paris c made out the four nights but not within the time I was engaged As his wife's death kept him some weeks off the stage and greatly retarded my intended expedition and by that serious intervention drove my benefit till the th of MayThe play was The Tender Husband or The Accomplished  oolsNumps Mr Woodward Sir Harry Gubbin Mr Wilkinson Ca  tain Clerimont Mr Dexter Biddy Tipkin Mrs DancerWith a paltry piece of stuff I called The Auction wherein I was the Auctioneer My friend Joseph always ready to assist acted a part called Lady ToothlessIn which interlude we gave a specimen of the French Harlequin Comedy with what  it Master Tate and Master Joseph could bestow on their goodnatured audience not much to our credit but we escaped to the full as well as Mrs Jenkins and Mrs FuzThe Farce was Thomas and Sally I acted Dorcas as an Italian and really with good reception and success my broken English and imitation of foreign manners were so preserved within proper bounds as I may pronounce of myself was tolerable and at the finish spoke the exact words and in the manner of Signora De Amice the greatly followed Italian singer of that season at SmockAlley theatre which had a catch of quick applause and laughing approbation  "Me am sorry me am extremely sorry me cannot speak better EnglisMe return my sincere tanks for dis grat a favorMe vould vish bettar much bettar vords to express my gratitude"  The evening finished with great laughter but the sum total I received was only l some odd sh  llings I must not forget a particular circumstance which happened that very night at the conclusion of the Tender Husband al  had gone on smoothly till the end of the comedy when on a sudden even Woodward was planet strucknot one could proceedthe audience hissedWoodward crossed the stage to me and authoritatively chid me for not speaking the tag I said  he  was wrong and disclaimed any knowledge of a line more in my part I spoke to Mr DexterMr Dexter to Mrs Dancer now Mrs Crawford and with disgrace the curtain dropped and after each person looking on the other like searching for one's kneebuckle in a hurry which at the same time is often where it should be so we on inspection found the last speech and tag belonged to Mr Dexter who was a very perfect actor in general But the same misfortune has been known in London to have happened for when it comes to the tag as we call it of a wellknown play we at rehearsals like careless people at church begin to move off before the blessing is pronounced and from  that omission in the morning it begets inattention and we fall into the pool of disgrace at night So when the book was produced it told in glaring letters that Mr Dexter was the defaulter Now says the reader where was the prompter Why my good Sir or Madam when players come to what we call a standstill they are then dumbfounded stupid animals and cannot say  bo  We are not always the wisest of mankind nor yet quite so ignorant and vulgar as we are sometimes honoured by the kind estimation of too many and be it observed and remembered that accidents will happen in the best governed families  Another odd theatrical adventure happened at  hat very time Mr King who was as great an established favourite as I ever remember in Dub  in not even Woodward excepted not having been in Ireland from the spring till that of Mr Garrick had given him leave three or four weeks before DruryLane closed hoping he would have obtained fine gleanings in the month of Ma  by visiting his Dublin friends and admirers after an absence of three years Great expectations were formed yet the attraction failed and on his benefit in particular which was the Monday after mine for an influenza had seized men women and children I never was worse with any illness than at that time Austin and I  were in the middle gallery on his benefit night when I do not believe there were twelve persons there besides nor much more than l in the house even though Mr King played Bayes in the Rehearsal and had to change his dress between two or three of the acts for he spoke Bucks have at ye All and acted in Mr Garrick's Interlude of the Farmer's Return from London and had his abilities assisted by a very good company as may be seen in the bill of the Jealous Wife  Mr King's good sense will not be angry at this recital for it is an instance of the power of fashion more or less in every place But when Mr King a few seasons after returned the people were not so unwitted for on his being advertised to appear in Lord Ogleby it was with the utmost difficulty a seat could be obtained not only for his first night but several succeeding ones all ran in crowds to see their old favourite Tom King every time he performed though a very bad set of players to assist him  Dublin is remarkable for doing a great deal for the actor or nothing and if one particular part by a performer happens to please their fancies and judgment once a week to the end of the season it will fill the house The winter in November and December he performed with as high spirits and more profit than on any  preceding he ever made there and was so caressed and esteemed by every one that they were not contented when his first engagement was finished with the manager and therefore he agreed for twelve nights more after Christmas which was equally beneficial with the first and the Irish hospitality was such that it is well he got away with safety for wherever they esteem they are apt to endanger the healths of their guests with acts of kindness He then went to Scotland and performed four nights at Glasgow which run in regular progression Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday and each night to an overflowing house On the Saturday he travelled fortyfour miles from Glasgow to Edinburgh where at six o'clock there was not a seat to be had in any part of the theatre an  at seven o'clock he was on the stage receiving the warmest welcome from an audience pleased to see not only so excellent an actor but a gentleman whose own natural good qualities were superior or at least must be allowed equal to his abilities as the player  Owing to the influenza having confined me for  ome few days and not having any engagement confirmed either in Ireland or England to call me  rom Dublin I did not depart though my engagement finished on the th of May Wishing for  little country air I requested my friend Austin  to dine with me at one of those pleasant villages with which Dublin is romantically and delightfully surrounded At our return on entering the metropolis I accidentally cast my eyes on the plaisteredup playbill and to my infinite surprise read  "The Orphan Castalio Mr Barry c and between the play and farce Mr  Wilkinson  will give TEA After which Mr Macklin's Love AlaMode"  I thought it very strange unprecedented and rude behaviour my nights being expired and my time delayed that Mr Barry or Mr Woodward should improperly advertise me for what I was not then prepared for at their territories and that done by one or both without a line or message I felt myself angry and hurt and declared I would not attend the theatre but Mr Austin perswaded me much not to abide by that resolution He urged that the managers had acted rather cavalierly but judged it much more advisable to avoid offending my friends or the public or even the managers we might meet again it was always better to be on terms with those leaders in power and he did not doubt but they meant to pay me some compliment To this friendly admonition and advice I not only attentively listened but obeyed its dictates went to my lodgings dressed and prepared to give some jumbled performance at the playhouse when there  I complained of the ill behaviour which the graces of Barry soon made easy and prevented me from permitting rage to fire my bosom When the Orphan finished and Barry had as the unhappy husband of Monimia departed to the imaginary shades I in a few minutes informed Mr Carmichael the prompter that I was ready to give the whole house Tea tho' without cups and saucers but just when the curtain was drawing up the said Carmichael came in a violent hurry and told me he came with peremptory orders from Mr Barry that I must not on any pretext whatever attempt to proceed with my part of the entertainment for the evening until the end of Love AlaMode and that Mr Macklin insisted on that injunction being complied w  th  Mr Macklin was ever tenacious of his favourite of  spring and he judged I do conjecture that any delay or laugh  immediately after  the tragedy from the audience might in some small degree take off the relish when Love AlaMode began However I persisted that if I obliged Mr Barry with doing what he had not the least right to com  and or expect I would unless I was then permitted to perform instantly quit the theatre To that declaration Barry did not pay much attention and as he was ever intimidated by Mr Macklin and tremblingly alive and fearful of his  desertion to Mossop the mortal opponent of Crowstreet citadel of course neither my petition nor remonstrance could prevail and I as obstinate as either not only left the royal army under the command of the master revellers but instead of going home retired to Mr Acheson's a private and worthy family in Trinitylane where I was assured not any pursuers would ever dream of finding me or indeed if they had I should not have returned  After inquiring as to the termination of the evening at the playhouse I was informed that all went on smoothly the piece received the tribute due to its merit and Macklin Barry Woodward and Messink a repetition of approbation which their respective merits had so frequently obtained Not one of the three leading personages had cast a thought on Wilkinson nor did they suppose he would be called for or if he was that a slight apology from the manager of Mr  Tate's  departure would settle all matters amicablv  But the event proved much to the contrary for when the farce finished and the audience were judged to be departing on peeping through the curtain a few minutes after their supposed  exeunt omnes  they were all espied in dread array and as regularly seated as they had been viewed the hour preceding and on neither  preparatory music giving the elevating sound nor Mr W making his expected appearance from a murmur a violent clamour ensued when speedily Mr Barry stepped forward and informed the large assemblage the whole matter that Mr W it was true had been there but for what reason Mr B could not divine Mr W had as unexpectedly as suddenly eloped however that would not in the smallest degree pacify them they judged their rights infringed and their authority much imposed upon insisted on my being sent for and said they would sit patiently till I attended and fulfilled my dutybut all the messengers' search was fruitlessand indeed had it been otherwise and they had found me in my hidingplace I should not have returned to have endured the wrathful resentments and disgrace I certainly had not deserved and must have suffered but snaillike would have pulled in my horns and kept snug and secure within my shell For the manager certainly as I was not engaged then to him had not the right or the power to act as he did and I forewarned of the displeasure I had incurred had prudently determined I would not venture my sweet self again in their field of battle that year of our Lord On their patience being exhausted and Mr Barry's assurance of the various means taken to recover the lost sheep the whole blame fell as was likely  upon poor Tate and the departing guests one and all pronounced great punishment on my devoted head whenever it next popped before them and declared to the manager they would not mis  any opportunity to treat me with a dish of  their tea  in lieu of my own All this vexatious unlucky matter with various illnatured and increasing additions the next day or two much perplexed and distressed me the more so as I was not without visitors who in general condemned my conduct nor would yield to my being in the right even admitting the other party to have been ever so wrongFor they observed as my engagement was finished I could effectually have prevented any futur  mistake of the kind and even if what I intended to present to the public had lost some trifling applause or had not been relished by the audience it was not to be balanced against the almost certainty of offending many if not all of those  whom I had been so constantly obliged and indeed it must be granted though I was favoure  with many partial friends I should with deliberation on the other hand have considered that I wa  not without numerous enemiesmany deservedl  sowho would assuredly rejoice at such an ope  opportunity of relating it greatly to my disadvantage Now as to who was most in the wrong m  different readers must determine Not that I e  caped  entirely without punishment as in the year  I experienced an unexpected and whimsical  ta  ation which will be truly related in its proper time and place in this salmagundi dish of all  orts prepared by Mr Garrick's exotic The important subject very soon ceased and was put a stop to by the sudden appearance of Mrs Pritchard from London who never had been in Ireland and was engaged on large terms to perform a few nights with Mr Barry Her long established fame her excellent private character and universally acknowledged worth gave rise to wonderful expectation Notwithstanding such a combination of good promise and that she made her first appearance in one of her favourite and best esteemed ch  racters that of Lady Macbeth in which she wa  perfectly suited as to the figure manner voice  x  ution and judgment yet the experiment was  ed at too late a season of her life she never drew a  second crowded house  the bloom was off the peach and in general but in Dublin more par  ularly an accomplished beauty only can be alm  st assured of victory she with merit may slay hearts at will and like Bobadil call twenty into the field of love kill them twenty more kill them too nay more in Ireland a newborn Venu like Mrs Sullen may say  "O a fine woman may do any thing in DublinO my conscience  she may raise an army of twenty thousand men"  But I will leave the worthy ancient lady Mrs Pritchard and attend on myself who after the late fracas at CrowStreet Theatre left the Grecians early in June and when at Chester was induced to lounge there about eight days and formed an acquaintance with Mr Daniel Smith and Mrs Smith of the White Lion Inn He was one of the most spirited friendly and entertaining characters I ever met with hundreds are judges of the individual I am speaking ofLike other men that have merit he had envious enemies but they were so overbalanced by friends and great and deserved success that such opposers  ade the following line applicable to him  Their praise was censure and their censure praise  He was on my first intimacy in his prime of life of an intrepid manly disposition strong and happy in health attended with great liveliness not a gentleman of Chester or the county but liked Dan Smith as a companionTo him I owe several acqu  intances at Chester whom I reflect on with pleasu  e as well as the many happy days I have had there for Smith's house was at all times my home not that I accepted his favours without a return His and my intimates were Roger  ilberham  Esq  Mr Farrington Mr Fisher Tench Mr  Orme c I was so delighted with the first ci  ties which I experienced from Mr and Mrs Smith that it was actually with the utmost regret I could leave themhowever business must be adhered to and after a mutual promise of a con  ance of friendship so agreeably begun I took my leave and determined on going to Birmingham where I had never been and where my good friends Mr Hull and Mr Younger were as managers for the summer season I took a postchaise and on the second day arrived there to dinnerIt was quite a new scene to meThe company had acted three or four weeks and I intended my visit to Mr Hull for seven or eight days only Miss Morrison Mr Moody and several performers from London with whom I was well acquainted were therethey wished for my continuance provided I would accept the terms of the company which was a share and a benefit to that I consented I was not engaged at any other place and it was particularly agreeable to my own inclination  On the th of June Alexander was actedTo which was added The MinorI performed the usual characters  The following paragraph Mr Hull put to the bottom of the bill  "The company in order to render their performances as generally agreeable as possible have engaged Mr Wilkinson for the ensuing part of the season who will occasionally entertain the public with several characters in Mr Foote's manner and with various imitations of burlettas operas c as they have been repeatedly exhibited in London with universal approbation"  My mother's letter to me at Birmingham  MY DEAR TATE  YOURS of yesterday makes me extremely happy that you feel no remaining effects from that violent night's overdoing your strength that you are in favour with the town and also that you are at this hot time free from hard work in tragedy I am vastly delighted that you have the pleasure of so fine a country and with such a multiplicity of engagements with the people in high life only as you observe it is living too well which I hope will be carried off by fine air and your riding If you go to Worcester very possible you may see Mrs Hutchinson there at Mr Broomley's a man of fortune If she is not at the races and you have time WhitleyCourt at Lord Foley's is but a few miles which visit would reinstate you in her favour As you are so near the spot called Tato  Heath it is very right to think about what inquiries are to be made about it then in the first place you are to take the advice of some person of good character eminent in the law whether your father did not after his conviction forfeit all his rights to any thing he had from the Crown I remember that was Mr Sharpe's opinion and if so you can have no claim but if upon further inquiry you should be better informed your right as from your father would be very easy to prove at the Duchy Office It was the year forty when your father was at Warrington and all the papers I have relating to th  coals were signed by John Baily who if alive could inform you particularly where the coalpits were  How could you be at a loss to know whose kitchen I meant her ladyship's who I believe is as much distressed to support that family as ever I was in one far less Lord Forbes has been dangerously ill upon which news the Captain set out post for Dublin and whilst I was there yesterday letters came from him and Mrs Wilson of his safe arrival I most sincerely wish them all happy but returned home blessing God how much more true ease content and satisfaction I a  d my son enjoy for really as far as I can judge you are now in a round of engagements  of all the pleasures this world can give your way of life here so different I do not know how you will reconcile yourself to the change My desires are contracted in a narrow spherea mind in peace with the decent necessaries of life I hope by your enlarged acquaintance you may meet with those who will prove real friends and be of service to you upon many occasions as your men of fortune carry weight in every way of life And so to hear of your continued health and spirits will ever give the highest joy to the heart of  Your most affectionate mother G WILKINSON  London  August  Wednesday the th of August The Rehearsalthe first time I ever acted Bayes  The company was summoned by Mr Yates to Preston on account of the jubilee which is kept there with great festivity and celebrated every twentyone yearshe had engaged several principal London performers I returned back to Chester being eager to see my friend Smith and family and other new acquaintance at that place but I made my journey thither a pleasant round and took Preston in my way I met Mr Sowden coming from Ireland on the road and he turned back and wer  with me to the Jubilee and then to stay with me a few days at Chester At Preston we found very bad accommodations very dear very dirty and much crowded The procession was tolerable but not worth the trouble or expence of a journey to see it indeed I was very glad on the second day to persuade Mr Sowden to quit Preston for Chester for it was all confusion and mire except the main street which I recollect is spacious and handsome but it was the crowd and inconveniency that made us glad to depart and we went from thence to Liverpool where I had never before been and after one day's view we crossed in the East Ferry to Cheshire where we ordered a postchaise and got in good time to dinner at Chester  Mr Sowden's intimacy with me began the winter before at Mr Mossop's theatre where he was a submanager at that time He was a sensible shrewd bred man looked on in general as remarkably insincere not that I ever met with any thing from him in any respect but the opposite conduct I once went with him from Dublin to Wicklow a pleasant ride to receive some rents there He was very entertaining and a great epicure He was possessed of an ample fortune the consequence of being a good economist and well knowing how to lend his money to great advantage yet not  without good security He made himself generally pleasing as he never contradicted any body or disliked any thing at another person's table but always approved If a gentleman had said  "Sowden that cabbageleaf those strawberries are on is a fine leaf"  he would have sworn a loud oath that the cabbageleaf not only was a handsome cabbageleaf but by Gd the handsomest cabbageleaf that ever grew He was father to Mrs Jackson at Edinburgh and I believe she only came in for an inconsiderable part of his fortune but of that Mrs Jackson is the only competent and proper judge and I sincerely hope my conjecture may be quite wrong for her sake  From Chester I went to London where I had not paid my dutiful respects for several months and there had a welcome not to be suspected From thence for a few nights I paid a visit on the eve of the peace being settled between France and England to my brandy company of the old theatre at Portsmouth the Bath commander had left that place for his regular winter quarters ships of war were sailing daily into the harbour to be paid off consequently money was plenty and the theatre well filled I had not visited my friends for a full year I was therefore a kind of novelty besides having attained a supply of new characters The th of October I acted Lear also  Bayes c and finished with a crowded benefit and wellpleased theatre I have often wished once more to walk those ramparts and take a retrospect of my juvenile part of life so frequently employed on that spot where I was then so highly gratified with friends pleasure and credit whenever opportunity offers I will indulge myself for a few days with that trip From Portsmouth I returned by the road through Salisbury to Bath where I expected without doubt an engagement but there my vanity or my hopes call it which you will were frustrated as to the theatre Mr Arthur thought I asked too much and I that he offered too little in consequence thereof Mr Simpson of the great rooms obliged me with them to exhibit in and actually I had to a jumbed illconducted medley at s per ticket not less than l and I was at very little expence Mr Fleming leading  gratis  in short the night was universally fashionable and every body was willing to serve me which easily accounts for any success of that kind however wonderful it may appear It actually had such general sanction that the theatre was so deserted as to be obliged to be dismissed for the want of an audience on that evening an instance perhaps never before or since there within living memory I had a second night on Thursday Dec and very genteely  attended l it was much better conducted and approved and would have been more lucrative had my first been more properly considered  From thence I went to Bristol where I had never before been and on Tuesday February st I had a most brilliant and crowded audience at the assembly room in Princessstreet Mr Fleming assisted me again as leader and gave his Quaker's Sermon on his violin for which he was much admired and applauded and was truly a worthy man and universally esteemed he was father to the Miss Flemings now of Bath I returned the compliment in a small degree by once performing for his benefit at William Wiltshire's rooms on the th November at Bath but he assisted me twice there and twice at Bristol  I was much obliged to the ladies and gentlemen at Bristol for their general patronage and their kindnesses shewn me on those nights as except Mr Church at the White Lion Broadstreet Bristol I did not know even the names of three people in that opulent city my whole time there was entirely confined to Mr and Mrs Church They behaved with great kindness to me as I was very ill under their care in a fever near three weeks  To Mr CHURCH at BRISTOL  SIR  As I have not had any letter from my son since Wednesday se'nnight that he was then ill I am under great anxiety of mind concluding he is worse and if so beg you will let no attendance or advice be wanting and that if he is not able to write I beg the favour you will be so good as send me a line by return of the post for if my son is as I greatly fear ill I will upon your answer set out for Bristol I beg you not to fail writing as to a mother whose earthly happiness is placed in the life and health of her only child  I am Sir your most humble servant G WILKINSON  London  Feb  Please to direct for me Halfmoonstreet in the Strand  On my recovery from thence I returned by Bath to London for a few days recreation and then set off on an invitation I had received from Mr Ivory manager of the Norwich theatre so there was another new trip Mr Hurst whom I had known in Ireland was appointed the directing manager and I believe was the occasion of the offer Mr Hurst I had often met in my adventuring  as Garrick termed it and his behaviour at Norwich was kind and attentive to a degree both as to my profit when my benefit was to be fixed and in every other particular In return I really underwent infinite labour for he worked me not as an horse of blood but as an horse for burthens I even now sink at the very thought of how I drudged and toiled in that theatrical Norwich mine  On Monday February I played Othello on Saturday March the Minor Mr Bannister senr was there and took his first ideas of mimicry from seeing me play those parts in the Minor Cadwallader and other of Mr Foote's pieces My playing in the Minor drew  repeated  and  increasing  good houses This may appear as a stretch but Mr Dodd was there to whose services I have been much obliged at York he was a reigning favourite at that time and I call on him to vouch that tho' the city of Norwich is not the most theatrical town in the kingdom yet that audience to any piece that is well received will bear a more repeated acting of it than any other town of the size whatever I think the Padlock was acted twentyfive nights the first season now that to be accomplished from its production there with only four plays or but three in aweek I look upon to be equal to fifty times in London  Norwich season was then five months I acted Bayes four play nights progressivelySaturday March Monday Tuesday and Thursday The Rehearsal was much liked though not calculated for any audience  "to pit box and gallery it"  out of the meridian of London Dublin Edinburgh Bath or York Prince Vols  ius was acted by Mr Dodd and the present clever Mr Bannister played the grave sententious Mr Smith the Gentleman Usher Mr Weston who had not then acted in London and was not in any degree of eminence as a comedian I do not believe take it for all in all that Norwich ever had a better company than that identical season Mr Chalmers was there as a comic actor and I fear I speak truth when I say I verily believe he was a greater favourite than Weston he was father to Mr Chalmers with me at York some seasons a young man of merit and a very good harlequin  I will here mention that an adventure of mine related by Mrs Bellamy in her sixth volume relative to Mr Chalmers the comedian of Norwich passing for Wilkinson the York manager is no more than strictly true however vague romantic and improbable it may appear to a stranger I have been often taxed as to its authenticity but the following persons are still inhabiting this earthly  globe and must remember the transaction mentionedSir John Sinclair Mr Woods Mr Bland Mr Moss Mr Dea  h Mr Beynon Mrs Webb Mr and Mrs Charteris Mrs Inchbald and others were all then at Glasgow and subscribed to assist the strange Mr Chalmers at that time The day I met my friend Socia Wilkinson at Hollytown was on Saturday the th of April But as that matter is not in the least relative to my adventures at Norwich and lest I should stray until I am bewildered I will get back to that town and inform the reader that after being cordially and partially received in several principal characters my benefit night there was fixed on Monday April I had been lucky to a degree in having the honour to please the inhabitants of Norwich and almost every part repeated again also the farces were approved and Bucks have at ye All there was no end to I played at my benefit King Lear and promised to treat all the ladies and gentlemen with TEA which was seriously taken by the people in general as a contract they expected would be fulfilled it was thought very expensive and would be attended with much difficulty and trouble but Mr Wilkinson was vastly genteel but then how would he be able to find cups and saucers for such a quantity of people Why to be sure the quality folks  were to be served first then a fresh washing of the  to be humbly presented to Tom Mary Darby and Joan in the galleries What I am d  cribing is more serious than will be supposed  red  ble and however unlikely though it is the  it is not the only instance of the kind w  th which my readers shall hereafter be made acquainted I have the pleasure to say I was my  e  f much pleased at the very great compliment pa  d me as at the usual prices from that time to the present there has not I have been given to understand been ten such crowded houses seen at Norwich in the tedious round of twentyseven years In short the town was in a mob at three o'clock in the afternoon to secure a first seat if possible to see Mr Wilkinson and drink a Dish of Tea with him The interlude given that night as Tea was the same kind of mixed entertainment consisting chiefly of the imitations of those actors and the same materials which had been so greatly received in London Dublin c and with which the reader has been pestered from the first volume of this complex  what d'ye call itsomethingnothing of a book  for the work will certainly be allowed originality and that no such hurlothrumbo production as to information of jumbled matter and anecdotes ever before appeared What is more extraordinary than the strange  mistake which arose in the peoples' ideas should not only have been taken as seriously offensive at Norwich then but it actually laid the foundation for fabricating a thousand stories and Fame increasing as she goes told the tale with wonderful additions to the children of that time and remembered by those young ones who then could not lisp yet they can now relate what their daddies told them of me Wilkinson who promised to give all the town Tea and behaved so ill he would not keep his promise but made a joke of it  On eagle's wings immortal scandals fly  While virtuous actions are but born and die  It was soon after my departure circulated and even put at length into the newspapers which must be true that I was obliged to secure my personal safety by flight that I ordered a post chaise with four horses took all the money which had been received that night into a large silk handkerchief without waiting to count if all was right and got out of Norwich with all expedition lest I should have been torn in pieces by the enraged multitude and when I arrived in London they said Wilkinson laughed at the Norwich flats and an hundred ridiculous falsehoods of that kind were propagated and handed carefully down by that generation and piously transmitted to their children Now the  plain matter of fact was no more than by not satisfying them really with the eager expected Tea the thirst for which was so great that I verily believe had Mr Garrick been King Lear they would have thought the play had been too long but when they found no Tea they did not relish what I was doing as the way by any means to make them amends for the insult they supposed I had wilfully given to their understandings but what was more my likeness of Mr Barry Mr Sparks or any of the London performers was Greek to them and it was natural for them not to admire what they could not by any means comprehend The difference of audiences in such like circumstances is amazing A farce if it possesses true humour in London will be greatly relished and applauded  the country very possibly the same even decently acted shall be termed vile low vulgar and indelicate The Love for Love of Congreve the Trip to Scarborough the Way of the World the Confederacy and others are in London attended to as plays of wit and merit witness their constant repetition but in the country not permitted or if permitted to appear not upon any account fashionable which is just as bad  The same unlucky reception of my Tea at Norwich would happen to the ablest imitator in London supposing he gave the strongest likenesses  of the Edinburgh and York actors a London audience so tried would feel not only chagrined and disappointed but would give such tokens of resentment and anger as would far exceed that of the enraged Norwichers My farce that night helped to confirm my disgrace for out of London certainly no one was so very likely to displease as Mr Foote's Orators not only quite obsolete but local let any person now take it up of the age of twentyfive and it will puzzle the best head to find out or comprehend how at that time even in London an audience could possibly be entertained by it however well acted The porterclub the last scene of the farce gave it a complete overthrow though assisted by Mr Weston their patience was quite exhausted and I could barely make a finish I dare say no lady can feel this account more forcibly than Mrs Wells for without being on the spo  to judge as a witness and though surrounded by many friends and even the royal support of majesty she found I dare guess a material differenc  between giving her imitations of Mrs Siddon  and Mrs Crawford at CoventGarden theatre than before the best collected audience at Cheltenham  As Peter Paragraph in the Orators that night I only recollect a few nonsensical lines of Mr Foote's not printed which he always spoke and occasioned a laugh The character was draw  as a likeness of Mr Alderman George Faulkner an eminent printer well known in Dublin for which performance he sued Mr Foote and cast him for damages  When Foote wrote the part he had two legs but Mr Faulkner had but one Foote afterwards su  tained the same loss myself too nearly experienced the same painful and dreadful misfortune Thank God not quite so unfortunate When I was before the judge in the court of justice as s  bpoened on trial I related the following addi  onal lines as Peter Paragraph  Peter Par  An't please your worship Mrs Paragraph was as beautiful a woman and of as good a family as any in all Irelandher sister too is a perdigius agreeable womanshe has perhaps one of the finest necks of any lady in all Dublin I encountered her one morning upon the middle of the stairsmy hand fell accidentally upon her bosom and I protest and vow please your wor  hip it gave me such a  thrill  I felt it at the bottom of my dead limb  Second Story as  PETER PARAGRAPH  Peter Par  My wife Mrs Paragraph was a per  gi  agreeable woman As we were returning to Ireland in October in the year during the autumnal equinox a violent storm arose I  went down into the cabin unto her and said Mrs Paragraph my dear answer me one questionSink or swim have you been untrue unto my bed Says that dear woman by way of reply My dearsink or swim that secret shall go along with meO she was a perdigius valuable womanyou might have trusted her with any thing  At those little jokes I was applauded in Peter Paragraph but as to the stories circulated and believed about my running away from conviction of intentional affront from myself they were too ridiculous to tell and more so to be credited what added to the idea of designed insult that night was at the conclusion of my Tea I gave a Medley which Mr Garrick himself had wrote for Mr Beard and given to me he designed it first as a compliment to Mr Beard for his Ranelagh benefit but after that he altered it for the playhouse  The lines taken as rude were the very harmless ones that follow to a common tune  Now if you think I'm wrong  In all I've said or sung  And wish that poor I had been dumb dumb dumb  Tho' the fish are in the net  Yet I shall fume and fret  And though I have caught you be mum mum mum  I therefore beg and pray  That nothing you will say  Lest others next year should not come come come  For if like you they're taught  They'll not like you be caught  And therefore I pray you all mum mum mum  Their being in an ill humour and my singing those lines in the medley very gravely as I judged a very good joke they absolutely took seriously and occasioned all the bustle and nonsense here related and in resentment they echoed back  hum hum hum  and it was agreed  nem con  that I intentionally laughed at them  To speak my thoughts on the matter I perceived myself much injured by such illsuspicions and misconstructions on all I had done and I really had fatigued myself more that night hoping to please than almost any one I ever performed before or since as it was too much even for a stronger constitution than mine  As I remained on the spot instead of quitting Norwich my very extraordinary departure from which I shall immediately give an account of that must satisfy all who believe or disbelieve to the contrary  During my residence there my mother gave me  e following account of her ILLNESS by which  t will be perceived as a son I did not neglect that precious friend  MY DEAR TATE  I HAD the pleasure of yours on Tuesday but was neither able nor willing to inform you that I have been so far gone as to be obliged with great reluctance to have the further advice of an eminent physicianI am but just begun with his advice but having done all I resign myself to the Great Disposer of life or deathI have had two very friendly visits from Mrs Batt Lady Forbes not very little noticed till this day two bottles of Madeira with an offer of any thing in her power I know her good will would not be wantingI pity her and think her situation more distressed than my own She offered writing to you but I said I had wrote and would again as soon as able I wonder not at your being heart sick of the Minor feel glad at this week's rest and should be still more happy if you would give way to a few serious thoughts why this is truly called the  Passion Week  You will excuse these little hints from one who is ever anxious both for your increasing happiness here and hereafter  Your most affectionate mother G WILKINSON  London  March  MY DEAR TATE  YOUR affectionate cares and unbounded offers far exceed what I could ever either expect or desire I thank God I have not wanted any necessary helps and for your kind fears that I do not cheer my spirits with eating and drinking you know I cannot bear two days plenty without being ill and I had as I told you dined out every day which occasioned my present illness I am I hope better but kept weak by physic Mrs Hutchinson sent me a chicken and six bottles of Bristol water refreshing draughts Of what use am I to think of a journey to Bath at your expenceNo my dear Tate if I ever consent to that you must be there  o complete the cure and as to accepting your princely offer of l for the journey oh that must be a most desperate and killing extremity indeed and could give no true nourishment whilst feeding so deep upon what you so industriously slave for but above all the overflowing joy and satisfaction you give completes the wishes of my soul in that serious just sense you express so sufficiently in few words of that awful reverence impressed by God upon your mindhold there and be blessed for ever  The expeditious filling your boxes appears highly in your favour indeed but that pleasure  seems still to be alloyed by the impossibilities set forth in your overworked bill for after  Lear  alone I should wish you in a warm bed  Though a sight of you even for one night would rejoice my heart yet I beg you will rest a night or two and as your trunk must be much shattered would have you get a new one and leave the old one here  Having just made a comfortable meal of half a fine sweetbread with the blessing of God hope to be able to cook and eat with you by the time you talk of seeing again  Your ever blessed And affectionate mother G WILKINSON  London  Apr  These short letters it is true have no particular connection with the work but the contents flowed  rom a pen of such true worth as will render them far from unacceptable to every worthy mind whether depres  ed or exalted as  "Nature speaks with most miraculous organs"  My benefit was Monday April and on Wednesday the th of April I acted  ouglas I also spoke Bucks have at ye All and performed the usual parts in the Minor Sufficient duty for one night well or indifferently manoeuvered for  I was threatened with strong marks of resentment and they were in reality very angry so I was prepared for and expected it Yet I was such a favourite that when I made my appearance their goodnature got the better of their disgust and I was astonished at receiving my usual good welcome not a  single mark  of  disapprobation  Thursday the th I played Mrs Amlet and for the first time Hartop in the Knights Sir Gregory Gazette Mr Weston Tim Mr Dodd On Saturday the th was advertised my last night of playing I spoke Bucks and repeated Hartop The comedy I was not concerned init was Rule a wife and Have a Wife acted purposely to introduce Mr  arry Kennedy and was the only night the manager Mr Ivory had left as manager the regular course of bene  its beginning the Monday following  Two offences  more  in the course of the week I was informed I had committed but indeed very innocently It was at that time not only the custom there and a horrid custom it certainly was but also at York Hull c c for the performer whether man or woman to attend the playbillman round the town knock humbly at every door honoured with or without a rapper and supinely and obediently stop at every shop and stall to leave a playbill and request the favour of Mr and  Mrs Griskin's company at the benefit Th  heroine if unmarried was equally responsible fo  steering her stepsno matter whether the Juliet the Cleopatra the Lady Townly or the Quee  Elizabeth no dignity of any kind allowed fo such an omission without being construed a violation of duty that severe law of custom then i  force must be complied with or looked on as a  infringement of rules and respect and would incu censure with the appellation of pride impudenc  insolence and want of reverence no matter ho  severe the weather if frost snow rain or hai Jane Shore and the proud Lady Macbeth we  expected equally to pay the same homage If th Lady Turtle Dove was blessed with a loving mat  her attendance was dispensed with but not othe  wise on any pretext whatever in that case th honour devolved on the husband These law thank God I had not been accustomed to an having a plentiful wellsupplied pocket had  need to comply or trouble myself to use such practice which I da  e say superior minds to  own have from the dictates of prudence and n  cessity against their will too often complied wit  and the produce of my house proved such degr  ding rules were better broke than kept for the cr  dit of the actors And blessed be the times to s  what I relate had better not have been mentione  but be buried and forgot But there are those who can vouch to the inglorious and disgraceful truth and I can boast as being one of the first who relieved my brethren in the country from such slavery  Another custom was after the play the performer was to return thanks and if married both husband and wife to appear Mr Frodsham once at York spoke a comic epilogue on his benefit night and actually carried his wife now living on and off the stage on his back to comply with the expected homageon particular occasions four or five children to make up weight courtesying and bowing in frocks had a wonderful effect as the audience in general and the ladies in particular prided themselves upon bestowing their bounty on such a painstaking man or such a painstaking couple as they proved themselves to be Tho' I had heard so much of those customs yet I was honourably received after all my alledged ILLBEHAVIOUR  at Norwich  as usual with much pleasantry and good humour The last night of my acting there I made as polite an acknowledgement as lay in my power and meant what I said that I really thought myself as a stranger at Norwich particularly honoured and obliged which coming unexpectedly was received with double effect and I was dismissed with great glory and marks of approbation  and the audience were not a little pleased that I confessed myself indebted to them for the favours they had conferred on me  Now after such particulars it is really astonishing how such falsehoods to the contrary could be propagated and believed from that time and never cleared up till when I was last at Norwich and will be much more so by this faithful account Another strange custom they had at Norwich and if abolished it has not been many years which was for a drummer and a trumpeter not the King's in every street to proclaim in an audible voice having been assisted by his shrill notes to summons each garreteer without which ceremony the gods would not submit to descend from their heights into the streets to inquire what play was to be acted nor ascend into the gallery  A custom of this kind prevailed so far with a Mr Herbert's Lincolnshire company in the time of our revered wellremembered and beloved Marquis of Granby that when at Grantham the players determined to omit the usual ceremony of the drum wishing to grow more polite and by obstinate perseverance Lady Jane Gray Mary Queen of Scots King Henry the Eighth the King of France nay even Cardinal Wolsey had no command attraction or power over the populace when they lost their accustomed and so much  loved sound of the drum and trumpet The ladies were obstinate tho' they could not by all their arts or by all their charms obtain a livelihood and their heroism was so great that they preferred death honourable death rather than submit to slavish terms The Marquis of Granby sent for the manager of the troop and said to him  "Mr Manager I like a play I like a player and  shall  be  glad  to  serve you  But my good friend why are you all so suddenly offended at and averse to the noble sound of a drumI like it" said the Marquis "and all the inhabitants like it Put my name on your playbill provided you drum  but not otherwise  Try the effect on tomorrow night  then you are as thinly attended as you have  a ely been shut up your playhouse at once but  it succeeds  drum away  "  The manager communicated this edict to the princes princesses  peers  and  peeresses  and not only they but even the  mbitious stepmother  gave up all selfconsideration for the public weal and it was after some debate voted  nem con  in favour of the drum they deigned to try Lord Granby's suggestion and to their pleasing astonishment their little theatre was brimfull on the sound of the drum and Lord Granby's name after which night they rowdi  dow'd away had a very successful season  drank flowing bowls to the health of the  noble Marquis They left Grantham in great credit without being drummed out of town tho' accompanied by their friend the drummer and I am told the custom is continued at Grantham to this day This is a strong proof how difficult it is to surmount prejudices whether in religion politics or even so trivial a matter as the sound of a drum for rumour has fewer tongues than she has ears  But my good reader observe I have not yet in my History got from Norwichif you will kindly look back to Mr Kennedy's acting Leon the last night I played there in I must faithfully inform you that after all my quarrels c with Mr Foote however contradictory to my resolves and Mr Foote's repeated declarations he had secretly sent Kennedy to Norwich as an ambassadour with credentials neither more nor less than not only to present articles of peace but fo  reuniting our forces and to engage Weston fo  the ensuing summer at the Haymarket Mr Kennedy was commissioned to assure me that Mr Foote was much concerned for the misunderstandings and mistakes which had subsisted between us for no less than  five years  that h  wished Mr Kennedy as an acquaintance an  friend of both would inform me I might depen  upon his being serious and honourable in meaning  an engagement which he hoped would prove lasting and advantageous to both that in many pieces dividing the parts would be better for each of us for however clever he might flatter himself to be from his own opinion and the partiality of the public he was convinced one person perpetually before the audience be he ever so excellent and meritorious had not so great an advantage as by a little space ere he was seen again a certain good remark for me then and many young performers now to remember His letter added that he had wrote a part purposely for me in a new farce called The Mayor of Garratt which  should cut out unless I would consent to perform italso a division between us in Tragedy AlaMode and that I should play Hartop in the Knights and he would act Sir Gregory cHe asked what I desired for every night not only when I acted but every one that his theatre in the Haymarket was opened and that I might take my benefit at three weeks notice whenever I pleased in his season and be allowed to revive or act on that night what I thought proper and that it should be clear of all expences whatever and concluded with assuring me he should not only be heartily and sincerely glad to see me as a performer but as his particular friend that his house and table should be always at my service if I  would do him the favour to make it my home whenever not better engagedThis was a change and it was flattering profitable and reputableI instantly made proposals which were immediately agreed to by a letter that reached me on my arrival at York and the first week in June I was to attend the Haymarket theatre  What made Mr Foote so very generous open and explicit was that he judged it would be lucrative to him if he complied as to terms  So it plainly appears that a war of five years was amicably and honourably concluded with a peace not inglorious but equitably adjusted for the advantage of both parties and from that time not any bickerings or breach of treaties happened between us to the time of his death in the autumn season Peace to his manes His entertaining qualities and universality of executive and astonishing genius are too well known established and acknowledged to need any eulogiums from my weak abilities He was not without virtues though he had those foibles and faults to which human nature is too subjectSo Foote farewell  All thy good now blazes  All thy ill be buried in thy grave  From Norwich I took a trip to York where I had never been and entered into a treaty with Mr  Baker for six nights Mr Baker was the gentleman I named as manager of the York theatre with whom I had previously formed an intimate acquaintance as beforementioned at Mrs Wier's in the autumn  As my Norwich engagement finished on Sunday April the th I intended quitting that place on the Monday morning following but as I had grown rich I at that time was wonderfully prudent and determined on a saving scheme So I gave up all idea of travelling so far as York and lolling all the way in a postchaise Therefore the only prudent method was to go in the Monday morning's coach as far as Newmarket but I could not be permitted to take a place for half way unless they were left empty for want of London passengers which was and is I believe still the constant custom I was called up early on the Monday morning to be ready for the coach but judge my disappointment and chagrin when on my approach I found it chuckfull as is often said at the theatre What was to be done A postchaise I could not think of on account of the chargeThere was no time allowed for consideration as  ll was prepared and ready at the Maid's Head for instant procedure I determined to leave Norwich most triumphantly and at an easy expencetwo points not always in the power of us mortalsby  exalting myself on the coachbox a situation  was as unfit for as the undertaking to ride o  horses at the Royal GroveBut previously I had petitioned reasoned urged and intreated but all to no effect I could not make any impression on the obdurate souls who proud and sulky kept easy and firm possession of their seats and hardly deigned to answer when I requested permission to be squeezed in but could not soften their hard hearts and under the rose be it spoken no hearts are harder than those of travellers in stage coaches diligences c and not without some reason for if not guarded by hearts of steel it would with the conjoined interest of innkeepers and postboys be a perpetual tax upon our goodnatures our convenience and our pockets as we should pay for what we did not possess However the inside passengers on that occasion called aloud on Mr Whip to drive on so my trunks c were left in the basket and I was hoisted on the coachbox as the only alternative but on the first movement of the vehicle if it had not been for the arm of the coachman I should have been instantly under the wheels in the street as I had not the least notion how to keep my seat  therefore the enraged travellers were under the necessity of once more being detained till I was relieved by the help of the hostler and servants o  the inn who were there and full ready to assist I was received into their arms from the coachbox and chucked into the basket as a place of more safety though not of ease or comfort where I suffered most severely from the jolting particularly over the stones it was most truly dreadful and made me suffer almost equal to the seasickness I had experienced on board the pacquet in a storm however as I had lived well at Norwich the coach emetic did me no harm  The stage coaches then were not hung on springs as they are at present nor were the roads near so goodThe coach was then double the time in performing the journey We arrived at Newmarket where though I produced myself as an outside passenger I was permitted the honour of being treated at table as an inside guest for they all knew me and pitied my situation but naturally preferred my suffering some torment rather than being miserably stowed themselves by cramming the vehicle as if loaded with Norwich turkies at Christmas and that merely to accommodate a stranger We of the coach all supped together separated for bed wished each other a good night with pleasant and safe journies to our different destinations they to London myself to cross the country till I got to the great North roadOn inquiry I was informed a stage crossed from  either Ipswich or Bury I forget which the next day about twelve which I determined to wait for and I conceived it a matter of pleasing intelligence for it had a delightful convenience as to the hour of its coming as it allowed me a long time to rest before it arrived After I had breakfasted on Tuesday the coach stopped and from out of it to my infinite mortification came no less than six passengers therefore I thought of nothing but ringing the bell and having immediate recourse to the agreeable though expensive postchaise but on inquiry one of the persons had only taken a place to Newmarket in order to be in readiness for the next Norwich coach to London So after an hour's baiting for the guests and horses we took possession of the vehicle proceeded slowly and arrived about three o'clock at Cambridge where finding not any other carriage crossed on to the North road I sat myself down at the inn a very indifferent one and ordered whatever was ready to be produced for my immediate dinner  While I was regaling over my pigeon pye c a very decent elderly looking kind of man a farmer made his appearance seemingly communicative and intelligent I asked him questions relative to the distance from Stamford and what places were  best worth seeing at Cambridge This formed an intimate chat and he accepted part of my bottle of port When I thought of ordering my chaise a  ter a little walk to view the gardens and buildings of the place in a cursory manner and taking my leave of the farmer who had been very attent  ve to my story and relating to him my manner of travelling from Norwich to Cambridge he said after carefully viewing me that he kept a traveling weekly cart which he came with from Stamford He was not fond of trusting strangers as appearances often were wrong but if instead of the expence of a postchaise I would accept his horse at a moderate price and go that night to Huntington the poor beast was at my service for the journey and he would himself with my lug  ge go in his cart which his man would conduct  relished the scheme mightily and judged I was  ndertaking a Quixote exploit by my attempt  g to ride a horse sixteen miles This great  atter was that afternoon put in practice and I  t off on my Rosinante and achieved my ex  loit by actually going the sixteen miles with  t any danger whatever and fancied myself a  mplete horseman but must observe what  th the delay in point of time the stopping all  ght at Huntington c my scheme of oeco  my was only visionary for the etceteras would  have been more comfortable and actually l  expensive than the laborious and mean plan  in my wisdom had entered upon The carrie  however honoured me so far with his good opinion first securing my luggage that he went off at si  in the morning for Stamford and left me and th  horse to take our leisure having first very kindl  invited me to dine with him at Stamford Whe  I got there I called to see him and he really expected me as his guest but that I avoided sent  porter for my luggage thanked the carrier and once more became the gentleman at one of the principal inns waiting for the York coach with strict orders at night to be called up at five for th  purpose of securi g a place but after loungin  my lonely day at Stamford and being summoned to be in readiness for the coach here my unfortunate stars again pursued me for lo the coac  was full with three officers and three insignificants In that bewildered and perplexed state wha was to be done Why give a strong proof of perseverance and in defiance of danger and like  great little soul for surely it was a meanness onc  more throw myself into the arms of my old frien  the basket It was very sharp windy cold disagreeable weather and the jolting over the stones i  every country town in that captive state might b  deemed truly dreadful both as to pain and fatigu  The officers who in general are polite friendly entertaining and agreeable soon recognized me and professed being hurt at my disagreeable situation but their feelings were not so exquisite and humane but that laughter evidently was victorious on the occasion to me jumbling through Grantham was terrible and equalled to my fancy that o  Algerine slavery yet though I appeared to myself like a vagabond passing by act of parliament from parish to parish and felt great cold without I had some amends by being admitted as one of their own party at every stage within or where  y refreshments were taken which was some  eviation to my sorrows though not satisfactory  or those sorrows as too often is the case were of my own bringing on as foolish indiscretions often give a strong colour to appearances that serve to corroborate as facts which originate every one of them perhaps from a trivial and undesigned chance that tumbles blunder upon blunder till it forms a something which if properly known would end  ke the airblown bubble of the day  So was I rightly punished in my journey to York by undergoing shame fatigue and the hazard of my health while I possessed a plenty to have prevented any one of those vexations for I suff  r  d mys  lf to be hoisted from my dogkennel  r two days stage after stage but as under the  greatest afflictions sometimes a gleam of hope will arise though soon again to vanish so in this journey on the first night the three officers at supper agreed to take a chai  e at Ferrybridge and quit the York road for that of Boroughbridge and proceed on to Scotland This gave me great spirits as it insured me an inside place for my fir  t entrance into the city of York where rather than arrive basketted I would have entered triumphantly in my carriage to breakfast the next day but all my hopes were frustrated by a change of their intentions and on they would go to York as their places were taken So far the reader may suppose I am not adhering to truth when I mention we were two days in going from Stamford to York but in the year the roads were so bad at particular seasons of the year that they were for want of proper forming almost impassable and it has been known in the winter to have been eight or ten days journey from York to London At that time it was not so familiar as it now is for ladies and gentlemen to fly like airballoons from the farthest points of east and west and from north to south For a lady now thinks not of hardship but of pleasure when she equips herself  en militaire  for a voyage to the East Indies either with a husband or for a husband There is not at present half the preparation to quit Yorkshire  for a few weeks and trip to Paris as there was sixty years ago to go only from York to London Cibber's John Moody gives an excellent description of that matter Fathers and mothers then made their wills ere they set forward and t  e leaving a darling pet son either at York or London to learn politeness education and good manners not forgetting the fashions were matters required more than common fortitude In short two hundred miles in this enlightened age is no more considered as a journey than formerly to dine at Windsor from London was which could hardly be done with the assistance of four horses and a moonlight morning  The old saying at London amongst servants was  "I wish you were at York" which the en  ged female cook now has changed for "I wish you were at Jamaica"  Scotland was then imagined by the Cockney as a dreary place distance almost as the West Indies now an agreeable party may with the utmost ease dine early in the week in GrosvenorSquare and without discompo  ure set down at table on Saturday or Sunday in the NewTown of EdinburghSo did I at  ain the journey in the basket in severe weather and jolting till the coach stopped at Ferrybridge wh  n to my joy and great comfort the officers  ok chaise and I got into as I at that moment  thought the most elegant delightful carriage I ever stepped into in my life I arrived safe at York and supped with Mr Baker That worthy man received me like a parent would not suffer me to be at an inn or hire a lodging but yielded up his own convenience of bedchamber for a very inconvenient situation in point of comparison and unless I ordered what I liked for dinner the family might have been starved the old gentleman was so very attentive and earnest to make it pleasant to his young guest  Saturday April Romeo and Juliet with the Frenchified Lady never in Paris was plaistered on the walls for the benefit of Mr Buck This year was the first Spring Meeting that ever had been attempted at York It did something as to resort of company but the year after it sunk entirely and was not again revived till within a few years back at present it seems to promise a lasting establishment  My first appearance was on Saturday April the th in the Minor which was acted after Richard III and on Tuesday May the d for the second time after the Busy BodyMarplot Mr Frodsham I was well received by a very genteel house The ladies of York without any compliment have a grace a manner a decorum not often met with out of the Metropolis  B  th excepted for York certainly boasts a preeminence when the boxes on public weeks are crowded that dazzles the eyes of a stranger and no wonder for as London and Bath culls the choicest beauties from the three kingdoms so does ancient York city at times allure them from Hull  eeds Doncaster Wakefield Pontefract and every part of that noble spacious and rich county And I am free to declare that the ladies of York in  y judgment never shew themselves to such advantage as when they fill the boxes of the York theatre and for the sake of a person that shall be  meless I should be happy in having the honour o  seeing it so graced and enlivened much oftener  han it is  My next appearance was in CadwalladerMrs Cadwallader by Miss Philips my old acquaint  nce in Dublin in Miss Philips was when  first acted at York in great esteem with many  nteel persons and she was so kind as to assure  her acquaintance that I was no impostor but  e true Don Philip she having played for Mr Wilkinson's benefit in Dublin when the pit and  oxes were thrown together If that favourable  ormation was not of real service it was meant  ell and could do no harm but indeed I may  irm it deserves even now an acknowledgement for  her good report though  she hears it not nor sees  not  She meant wellwho can do more  Miss Warnford was then at York who was kind of patroness to her and I believe to her fa  account of me to that lady I must set down my self a considerable debtor to Miss Philips Mi  Warnford has been many years married to M  Sitwell a gentleman of large fortune whose whose integrity and good qualities are so generally know  as to render any panegyrick impertinent but th ever constant and benevolent acts of friendship have experienced from Mr and Mrs Sitwel would sink me into ingratitude did I not thus present my small tribute to their worth and sincerel assure them how much I esteem myself honoure and obliged  My third character was Bayes in the Rehearsa which was judged a service of danger Mr Frodsham being esteemed capital in the part but the  opinion was wrong for I had been so familiarize to that kind of playing and was so much bett  stage acquainted that I obtained a complete vi  tory in spight of partiality which in general obstinate yet must be allowed often praisewo  thy Indeed Mr Frodsham was totally un  for that character and his friends as well as th rest of the audience would have found that ou had not five out of six subscribed to whatever  did was quite right without even consulting their own judgments I repeated the Minor on Saturday and on Wednesday the th of May I acted King Lear and Frodsham Edgar in the mad scenes he was the best I have seen though I remember poor Reddish whilst I am relating it My Lear was greatly received as it did not interfere with their darling Frodsham and both being a the same play gave much satisfaction  Saturday May the Fair PenitentHorato Mr Wilkinson Lothario Mr Frodsham and the MinorTuesday May the  ason finished for my benefit with the Jealous Wife and Duke and no DukeI acted Oakley and Trappolin but depended on the  ccess of my never failing Tea as to attrac  onI was favoured with a crowded audi  nce both before and behind the curtain for  e stage was filled with gentlemen  At that time admittance behind the scenes was allow  not only at benefits but in general to the gentlemen  frequented the boxes  but my  ea scalded their mouths and though they were  t ready to set the hue and cry after me as at Norwich yet they grumbled much and the next day I heard of nothing but what a shame it was  have made Mr Wilkinson so fine a benefit and  return he only  laughed  at and insulted them  hum hum hum  In short it was evident in  the opinion of every body I only sneered at the York audience and that it was little better than picking their pockets and a great deal more and worse for slander is told readily and swallowed glibly  Slander  Whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue  Out venoms all the worms of Nile whose breath  Rides on the posting winds and doth belie  All corners of the world kings queens and states  Maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave  This viperous Slander enters  This was certainly irksome but patience ever was my badge and what I had done deserved praise though they had not done me justice for as I had gained laurels by my endeavours and dint of hard labour for which though I own I got money and in that material point was well satisfied yet all my glories withered and every wreath was torn from my brow so instead of a triumpha  exit mine was certainly a degraded one however  y pocket was full my health was good and my spirits were great and not aided but rathe  lessened by too much of the grape therefore  fig for care  fter my northern expedition I had twelve o  fourteen days to spare for relaxation so I pockete  my affronts and proceeded to see my frien  Daniel Smith at Chester where I drank the health of all my York friends not in Tea but over a bottle perhaps two or three of claret with Mr Wilberham and several others of that place and a very happy visit it was to me though not without fatigue for what we generally term pleas  re by a mistaken use of the idea is perverted too  ten to the contrary effect by not letting reason give  t its boundaries however I recollected business must be attended to as without the means I well knew pleasure and friends would be very distant for independence creates complacency and eagerness to please which dependance in a few days destroys So I veered about like the weathercock from west to south to visit once more my native home old London city  "where every one is witty and all the streets are paved with gold"  and to renew my acquaintance with my  old intimate Mr Foote whom I had not spoke to for some years  When I arrived at my lodgings I need not repeat the anxious mother was not only rejoiced but  m st speechless to see her son after an absence of several months and the more so on account of her late illness before  elated by letters to Nor  ich c After a few days solace on my own spot of birth parentage and education I paid my  evo  rs to the manager at the HayMarket theatre  where I found Mr Foote earnestly employed in  work of training his militia company to prepar  for a summer campaign He soon espied me i  the orchestre where I had observingly placed my self the Rehearsal was soon finished I mounte  the stage and after a most friendly greeting to th astonishment of every one the most amazin coalition of intimacy made its wonderful appearance and equalled any change politics had ever presented to view The troop was mute glad b  more surprised when the carriage was ordere  and Mr Foote insisted on my dining with hi  that day as a large party of the first persons we  to be at his table I did not expect such civility but it may easily be supposed I could not resis It also seemed to augur an intention of goo will at least and if not a good dinner goo company and Mr Foote at the head of the tabl  few persons even of rank would have disliked b  sides it placed me not only on a footing of super ority but prevented any suspi  ion in myself  to illtreatment from Mr Foote of which I h  not entirely divested my mind He was th  preparing his Mayor of Garratt in which piece  ha  wrote a pa  t he informed me that was fact abstracted from the piece and that he coul  with or without it It was impossible for hims  o do it for with a false belly for his intend  Major Sturgeon and to undress for Matthew Mug it was not practicable The pa  t was ent  ed Peter Primmer intended as a stroke of sa  e levelled at Mr Sheridan senr who about that time had busied himself much with delivering  ures on oratory and proposing a plan for the e  ishment of an academy for the teaching of p  p  s the true art of public speaking  Mr Foote mentioned our appearing together in the piece of the Minor for said he the public w  l be better pleased with having both than one and added however partial the town might be to him as author and actor combined yet the same person being perpetually in sight is cloying and in  eed I have often thought that admirable character of Othello would be better for the actor if not so incessantly in sight more pity and less fatigue to the performer would have been the consequence had Shakespear so contrived but his writings are so noble wonderful and natural that I do not approve of the liberty I have taken but will remove my remark more strongly upon my favourite character of Zanga which is finely drawn and a charming part for the actor but is much hurt by his beginning and ending almost every act of the play and though it must be granted the poetry is fine yet as it owes its beauties to the production of art not that of  nature it makes the Revenge a heavy laborious tiresome play though Alonzo Carlos Zanga and Leonora are all good parts for the performers Zanga particularly so  Well I must return to Mr Foote with whom I dined and it was agreed the Minor should be the opening piece early in June Shift and Squintum Mr WilkinsonMrs Cole and Smirk Mr Footewith the new farce of the Mayor of Garratt My Shift with the imitations was extravagantly well received and was repeated several nightsThe Mayor of Garratt had great success and a run of almost every night in the season it met with some opposition which in general only gives a whet to the appetite of those who chuse to approve and support  Peter Primmer I dressed with an old tyewig like the Barber's in the Upholsterer a long band neckcloth a large rod in my right hand and a Scotch plaid night gown and had six boys with primmers and rods and six girls with hornbooks as my attendants in procession as the candidate for being chosen Mayor of Garratt My likeness was strong and it was well taken and as a schoolmaster at Garratt near Wandsworth the dress was ridiculous and not totally improper but as a resemblance of Mr Sheridan  who always appeared at his lecture and every where as a gentleman my being  too comical  destroyed the effect therefore it was judged much better to answer the purpose intended to dress it in black and a bagwig c That alteration gave the people a strong conception of him they knew whereas the ridiculous wig and gown destroyed every part of the imitation by the absurd appearance The part I have entirely forgot and only remember it concluded with my speaking the following verses as an ode from the old hornpipe song of Nancy Dawson  Of all the girls in our town  The black the fair the red the brown  That dance and prance it up and down  There's none like Nancy Dawson  Her easy mien her shapes so neat  She foots she trips she looks so sweet  Her every motion is complete  I die for Nancy Dawson  how she comes to give surprise  With joy and pleasure in her eyes  To give delight she always tries  O Charming Nancy Dawson c  The above song spoken seriously with exact tone and manner had an admirable force on the  bility of the wellpleased audience  Mentioning my mock ode as Peter Primmer will not let me omit what at present gives me great pleasure from the lately seeing and hearing Mrs ESTEN recite that excellent composition Collins's Ode on the PassionsBut as her stage performances cannot with the least degree of propriety be here inserted to accord with my proposed plan and as the actors and actresses o  the York theatre will make an appearance in print hereafter

gone  No Zephyr fondly su'd her breast  No Nightingale came there to rest  The fading visions fled her eyes  The visions of her ecstacies  And if perchance she sought delight  It was amid the gloom of night  It was to hear the screechowl's cry  Or whistling whirlwinds rend the sky  To pour her melancholy strain  And catch a pleasure from the pain  IEN beheld her haggard air  At twilight as she wander'd there  And felt the sympathetic woe  hat Taste and Genius ever know  Then eager sought the City's throng  To vindicate the force of Song  S  e chose an Ode divinely wild  Wrote by the Muse a fav'rite child  rom COLLINS was the magic lay  That subject passions all obey  The Crowd a varying influence prove  Of Rage and Ho e and Fear and Love  And still implor'd him to rehearse  And own'd the thrilling pow'r of Verse  O thou sweet Bard who now may'st be  A s  adow fleeting o'er the sea  A vapour on the morning rose  A whisp'ring wind at ev'ning's close  Or if thy spirit love to dwell  A while within the vi'let's bell  Then in beatitude of change  From star to star exulting range  Live in the lustre of the day  Or float upon the lunar ray  Or rapt'rous join the hallow'd voice  Where endless Seraphim re  oice  O COLLINS whatsoe'er thou art  Deign deign to bless thy ESTEN's heart  A portion of those oys reveal  Which sure she well deserves to feel  "Of the person of Mrs ESTEN we will venture to say that it is truly captivating th  t the is happy in the disposition of it ALL must acknowledge blessed with a set of features uncommonly lovely and expressive a voice at once powerful and plaintive cheerful and mellow her merit as far as we are able to judge from what we have hitherto seen is nearly equal in the grave and in the gayand yet  wonderful to relate  with all these perfections she is scarcely known in London and as we are informed not even engaged there"  Mr Foote all that season continued everv act of civility in his power his table was my constant resort when not engaged either at South End  or at his lodgings in town for the HayMarket theatre then was on a smaller scale and the  house in Suffolkstreet did not apperta n as now to the theatre I supposed he judged  interest to be on terms and I was superior to any ill treatment being in fact the richest man of the two I was getting money perpetually did not owe a shilling and was in possesssi  n of some hundreds therefore was an independent gentleman Mr Foote now and then got a great deal of money which was soon expended  e theatre only by permission from the Lord Chamberlain during pleasure and he owed many hu  dreds nay even at last I am afraid I relate a truth when I affirm his funeral was at Mr Jewe  expence for notwithstanding his income from Mr Colman was not less than sixteen hundred ayear besides profits on the nights he acted yet have been informed he had not effects by  means equal to th  payment of his debts It sh  ks me to have related an account of so many  struck geniusses of birth and talents that have  a  acrifice to grinning poverty and incurred  ect and ignominy with great incomes Pray  to allot me a more fortunate  finale  be its  ment appointed for a longer or a short  r date But to proceed with a more particular account  our Haymarket sessionsI gained ground with  the audience weeklymy benefit was fixed o  the th of August on which night I revived th  Rehearsal and acted Bayesthe house overflowe  from every partno such receipt the whole season Mr Garrick was in Italy and had not acted Bayes for some yearsMy imitation o  Holland in the following lines  How strange a captive am I grown of late  Shall I accuse my love or blame my fate  My love I cannot That is too divine  And against fate what mortal dares repine  had such a sudden effect that Mr Churchill wh  sat in a balcony with the late Lucy Cooper afte  laughing to a very violent degree most vociferously encored the speech which was echoed by th  whole voice of the theatre and complied with by me of course with great pleasure Mr Churchi  said that he was convinced I was not a mimic's mimic for the imitations were palpabl  my ownHe also encored my mock hornpipe which was a resemblance of the manner of stage dancing The whole play went off with universal satisfaction and I was highly delighted Mr Foote that night was not pleased but rather chagrined at my good fortunethese things wil happen and stage minds in general are sooner irritated and hurt than any other set of peoples' bu a theatre is the temple of Vanity and Van  ty an  Envy are its constant residents  The farce on my benefit was the Mayor of Garratt in which Mr Foote of course played his Major Sturgeon  Mr Mendez a Jew and an appraiser in Bowstreet was the treasurer that season On his benefit he requested me to repeat the character of Bayes which entreaty I grantedhe had a full house and the comedy received additional credit I had very near been deprived of the play as Mr Foote's theatre at that time merely consisted of a  w trumpery scenes no wardrobe but such as was hired from Mr Barber's in Monmouthstreet and as to stage properties they were less known there than in the most distant rustic com  any that scoured the country round I was quite out of favour at DruryLane so had no  opes of assistance from that quarter but Mrs Rich on application being made to her supplied me with thunder lightning earth moon and sun also sent to my aid a full troop of horse they had been well trained were very quiet and of a great a  e were never turbulent tho' sometimes troub  e  with headstrong wanton riders It was a custom for the gentleman and his lady who were proprietors of the Haymarket theatre to reserve a  x for themselves of which they kept the key I sent a card the week of my benefit requesting the favour of that box as all the others were disposed  of A very rude refusal was sent back at which time Mr Rus  ini now of PallMall and some gentlemen were with me and complaining of not being able to procure anv box whatever On my receiving an uncivil answer I said  "Damn this Mrs Proprietor it would serve her illnatured spleen right to break open the door and fill the box"  The hint was no sooner given than seriously taken and put into practice for as soon as the doors were opened a large party paid and finding every place was taken except the  roprietor's which the boxkeeper assured them could not be opened on any pretext whatever they unanimously burst the old lock and filled the whole box nor had the turnk  y of the Recess rhetoric sufficient to have  he least effect for expostulation did not signify so they remained sole masters and sat in triumph till near seven when the play was going to begin at whi  h instant up came a limb of the law no less a personage than Mr George Garrick escorting the Lady Proprietress with a large party  gratis  who sum  oned the garrison to surrender and be treated as prisoners of war but they we  e as obstinate as urks and determined to defend the citad  l sword in hand The Lady Proprietress was astonished at the rudeness committed and insisted on her privileged right then tried angry and soothing words but neither her  persuasive eloquence nor the authority of Mr George Garrick aided by John Doe and Richard R  of WestminsterHall with all their united prowess could by any means avail The possessers of the inside works defended their intrenchment from any breach and they only in exultation  aug  ed and told Geo Garrick if himself and party would pay a crown per head they should be admitted not otherwise It cannot be imagined that it was an ea  matter to extract coin from a law  er's pocket consequently the La  y George Garrick a  d party finding it ineffectual by staying in the box passage retreated in disgrace but denounced vengeance on Wi  kinson For my own part  chuckled at the adventure not so much for the trifling pe  uniary advantage I had  ained but at that time I should  ave disliked the curious Garrick's party  gratis  over my head more than any other Next day the enraged lady waited on Mr Foote who loved mis  hief and despised his landlady where she gave an ample scope to her anger and repeated her wr  ngs but Mr Foote told her it was impos  e to prevent what had happened as to the  proper conduct respecting the box he could o  y say he was sorry for her disappointment and  s to  r Wilkinson's rudeness he wished to exc  se it but he had not sufficient authority to whip  for his fault and there the matter rested  ending evidently to my advantage for I must mention that the year following the lady herself sent permission for me to let her box to any particular friend of mine if the boxes were so taken as to make such permission necessary on my benefit night  Early in September as is customary on the approach of the royal theatres opening we finished our summer's campaign which ended gloriously not a little aided by the assistance of our militia Major Sturgeon  The night of my departure when I went to receive my blessing and take leave of my mother she had sunk her spirits so low with the strong prognostic of her departing from this life that she had been obliged to retire to bed and her feelings were so affectionately strong she could only embrace kiss and bedew me with her tears and inarticulately say  "O Tate my dear son I shall never see you more"  Her words were indeed truly prophetic and from that awful and distressing momentI will relieve my reader and myself from the sensation which must occurI departed heavily but got into the carriage and proceeded immediately for proud Salop known better by the title of Shrewsbury  Mr Whitley was manager of that company and a man well known as an extraordinary character  of oddity and rudeness in his traffic with actors and actresses for his imaginary dominions which domains were here today and gone tomorrow At that place the facetious the witty the generous the good Chace Price of revered memory to all who knew him was appointed commander of the Shropshire militia which had not been embodied as I was informed during the whole war which had then providentially ceased ti l the month of Oct owing to some dispute and disgust with the inhabitants of that county who had universally judged their young men illused as they had some years before this mentioned period thought themselves highly injured by government as they had raised a regiment for home defence trusting on that pledge of honour which was broke in a cruel manner as they were marched off to the sea coast were there surprised forced on board transports and sent to the Indies and all spoken of as creditable farmers sonsThat obstacle as the stories of the day went was given as the reason why the Shropshire regiment had not been raised in common with those of the other counties and all these difficulties had not been overcome till October Shrewsbury to all who know that spot I need not say is surrounded by a most pleasing countryCaptain  Plume speaks well of it in the Recruiting Office  and the Raven  n or Tavern therein mentione  I believe to this day is the favourite and fashion able house of resort I acted in that town wit  Mr Whitley's company six or seven nights for clear benefit which was my first point for striking at and it proved very lucrative but I ever worked like a horse at a mill to deserve my engagement whether in town or country My benefi was appointed at my desire on Monday October That day I beg the reader will notice wa  the first day of the militia's assembling and wha was really extraordinary happened on the annua fair for cattle at Shrewsbury and it is no mor  strange than true that they were to assemble it the marketplace The  louds approved it not for it was as dreadful and r  iny a morning as eve  poured upon the earth the pavement rattled with the bursts of heavy rain and hail accompanied with thunder and lightning The officers judged i  prudent to file off and the young cackling recruits from instinct followed at the very time the oxen cows sheep horses c were mustering for the fair and w  th the variety of collected captains ser  eants country bumpkins c it occasioned an uncommon tumult noise and distress to those concerned without doors but to the spectators who were so happy as to possess a warm room with  a good casement it afforded a very whimsical morning's view from the apparent ridiculous distress of the various parties interwoven of men and beasts c as the oxen ran helter skelter amidst the soldiers populace cMy benefit bill of that night was nearly as follows  The last night Monday October The Rehearsal Bayes Mr Wilkinson End of the play by  particular desire  the principal scene  ro  the new farce called The Mayor of Garratt  e character of Major Sturgeon of the West  inster militia by Mr Wilkinson also a scene fr  m the Orators Peter Paragraph by Mr Wilkinson with the farce of the Citizen Young Philpot Mr WilkinsonSurely I gave them enough f  r t  eir money whatever it might want in quality The house was crowded in every part particularly  s  age by gentlemen for want of room in the front of the house The officers of the new militia were all there and at their head the everentertaining  ha  e Price whom I r joiced to see he had sent  e a compliment at noon being my benefit  d wa  between the acts in great spirits chatting  e and others At the end of the comedy  the Rehe  rsal he  esired to wish Mr Bayes g  d night as he found himself much fatigued  his journey and expected a severe bout the  ext day with the bottle at the mess where he  was president he said he would get a good night's rest having travelled from London to Shrewsbury without going to bed On his departure I retired to dres  f  r the  ew part of Major Sturgeon the reader will observe that farce was not then in p  in  On my appearance behind the scenes as the Major I thought the countenances of several of the officers did not augur a pleasing effect to my intended performance but not supposing any violent anger could possibly arise without a sufficient cau  e hoped I should be made ample amends by the smiling faces and laughing cheeks in front of the theatre But the new commanders not having been at that ju  ture in London when Mr Foote's Mayor of Garratt was acting they knew nothing  its fashionable ton there or if they did would not allow that as a sufficient plea for them as men of valour why they should not resent an injurious affront from what they looked on as an unjustifiable and intentional insult they therefore one and all pressed so hard and close together at the first wing where I was to make my entrance as to prevent the possibility of gaining admittance on the stage and had not Roger the Bumpkin servant to the Justice Sir Jacob Jollup cryed out on the stage  "Pray ye gentlemen pray ye let Major Fish come to visit  my master"  they actually would not have suffered me to pass but from conscious shame and the hissing of the audience I was at last but not without much difficulty permitted to enter and I verily believe had they not so pointedly marked their indignation the bulk of the hearers would have passed the secret over as incomprehensible but such a remarkable and violent contempt offered to me was easily perceived by them and once conceived their ideas swiftly communicated like gunpowder when I came to the passage where Major Sturgeon relates to the Justice  "On we marched the men all in high spirits to attack the gibbet where Gardel is hanging but turning down a narrow lane to the left as it might be about there in order to possess a pig's stye that we might take the gallows in flank and at all events secure a retreat who should come by but a drove of fat oxen for Smithfield The drums beat in the front the dogs barked in the rear the oxen set up a gallop on they came thundering upon us broke through our ranks in an instant and threw the whole corps into confusion"  Now reader consider that however  outré  and ridiculous this speech from fancy was formed by the author Mr Foote the whole circumstance  had in similarity happened that very day in every ludicrous point and in consequence the offend+ed party swore that particular passage must be th  offspring of my own brain and done as an im+pudent and intentional disgrace to them and when the tumult of laughter from the audienc  allowed permission for me to proceed with  "The Major's horse took fright away he scoure  over the heath That gallant commande  stuck both his spurs into the flank and fo  some time held by his mane but in crossin  a ditch the horse reared up his head gave th  Major a dowse in the chops and threw tha  gallant commander into a ditch near the Pow+der Mills"  The officers were incensed to such a degre  that they left the theatre in dudgeon vowing ven+geance When I was undressed and prepared to g  to my own lodgings I had information that a ser+jeant with five or six soldiers were in waiting wit  orders not only to beat unmercifully but  duck poor Major Sturgeon in the river so in+stead of being lighted home I acted as servan  after all my  atigue and lighted others I got t a house where Mrs Price and a Mrs Lewis live  and ordered the account of the house to be brough  there and settled Mr Littlehale a friend  mine well known at Shrewsbury was there H  as also intimate with Chace Price Sir Francis De  aval c Dame Price my tragedy queen  t Portsmouth in escorted us upstairs the kitchen had an entrance on each side of the  ouse She had undertaken as my old acquaint  nce to look well to my playhouse doors and  ith an observant eye mind all was honour  ight where that tempting situation of tak  g money was transacted that essential article for real kings queens generals fine gentlemen  nd fine ladies for be it known there is as much  iety and suspicion on a benefit night out of London and it is looked on as necessary to be  s well guarded as the Bank of England when  reatened with conflagration and a riot Any gentleman who holds half an hour's nooncon  ersation with an actor in the country must have  served the following remarks and answers  e house on such a night was not well countedSu  h a night the house was not well gatheredThe  ecks were not rightOne of the doorkeepers was  to let up several without taking any money  nother doorkeeper took six shillings but returned  to prove his honesty  These sayings are often without foundation but I am afraid at times are known to be  too true  So Mrs Price's inspection into the deeds of the  oorkeepers with thinking eyes was truly necessary  but Mr Littlehale and I had not regale  an hour before every window below stairs were suddenly broke The militia officers at the head o some myrmidons rushed into the house and furiously demanded Wilkinson being assured  neither lodged or visited there they retired eagerly through the opposite door of the kitchen i  determined search of their destined prey having been at my lodgings first However on their departure I had that great restorative elixir those golden drops as Major O'Flaherty says which healed all my grievances for out of an old crazy tin and some wooden boxes I poured a plentiful libation of gold and silver coin the produce of Mexico and Peru which presented as charming a lava as can be conceived for a  quantum suf  cit  will make  black  WHITE FAIR  foul wrong  RIGHT  base  NOBLE OLD  young  and a  coward  VALIANT  After my incredible fatigues and a comfortable bowl I got safely to rest and late the next day attended my good friend Chace Price He declared he saw me with the utmost regret and chagrin lamented his early departure from the theatre a  had he staid he would have effectually put a stop to such brutish outrage hoped I would think no more of it If I imagined he said that the officers bespeaking a play with his name at th  head would be of service he would exert all hi  interest I told him the accidental affray the night before dwelt on my mind with very disagreeable reflections as the consequence might  a  e proved dangerous As to the play the next night I desired it might be understood I had no advantage from it nor would I receive any but as it would certainly serve the company I ac  pted it so far as a compliment and my servi  es that evening he might command He re  hed  "he was obliged to me"  and ordered the  layers to perform the Recruiting Officer as the  ene lay at Shrewsbury and desired I would repeat Young Philpot in the Citizen He appointed  ursday instead of Wednesday as on the Wed  e  day he had a venison dinner and devoted  he day to his friends amongst which number  he honoured me and insisted on my dining with  at the Raven on that occasion I made my compliments in return and assured him I would  end his summons with infinite pleasure I was  n that day a little after my time a fault I have be  n often told of but on his left hand at the  pper end of the table the head seat had been  reserved for me and the apparent inti  y and re  pect he honoured me with made the  stare and think they were in the wrong  r by the contempt they wished to have shewn  the player The dinner was good the wine was good but Chace Price was superior to both Mirth went round enjoying the feast of friendship and the flow of soul Singing was mentioned Chace Price said humourously he must first have a rehearsal for as his friend Wilkinson was going to leave Shrewsbury in a few days without one he should be imperfect and forget his part and begged the favour of me to repeat his favourite scene from the new farce of the Mayor of Garratt and if I would act the Major he was certain he could recollect Sir Jacob Jollup as he had seen it that summer in London so often which was strictly true His memory was excellent and he was frequently at Foote's and was the only man of true wit I ever heard Foote allow to be so or laugh with and listen to with pleasure nay Foote actually praised Chace Price behind his ba  k  Well we acted the scene which was highly relished The good humoured intention was smoaked and it ended with an afternoon and evening all in perpetual harmony animosity or disc  rd was no more thought of I believe the RH then in the militia is the gentle  n who of late years has changed red for  and has  een enlisting recruits for another  o ld as an eminent orator since his altering  his theatrical attendance for that of the tabernacle Whether he has been the saving of many poor souls or the contrary will be one day determinedMethodists are numerous therefore there will be no want of witnesses God bless and forgive that sect say I but fear they will not be so charitable as ever to return me the comp  ment as I never observed humanity in their  eed  The officers came to the play on the Thursday I dined once more at the Raven and on the Sat  rday left Shrewsbury for my favourite old city of Chester where I made a stay of fourteen days I had received pressing invitations from Mr Barr  and at the expiration of my Chester visit  at off for Holyhead once more to visit dear Dub  n The day before I went was my birth day November the th and that very day I received the following short letter from my beloved parent  MY DEAR TATE  I have been in my bed very ill in the bilious cholic these three days as soon as please God I am able will answer all your particulars but s  ll be at a loss to know whether to direct to Holyhead or Dublin or where With all God's blessings from  Your ever affectionate mother G WILKINSON  I flattered myself though it was an illness perhaps very severe at the time yet it might soon amend but God ordained it otherwisein whose presence I doubt not she at this moment stands pleading for his mercies on her son below  I set off from Chester and journeyed through Wales and from thence got once more to Ire  and but previously had taken a benefit night at the ExchangeHall Chester which was numerously attended I must remark an odd circumstance relating to my success at ChesterI acted twic  there at the theatre and never had a good benefit but at the rooms dependent only on myself I received on one occasion upwards of l Not tha  I ever attended Chester with a view for emolument of any kind whatever but being frequently at that place did occasionally as opportunity off  red try the experiment as I went to and fro s  frequently  Barry gave me a sum and my benefit to be clea  of all expences when I chose to take it so the  needed  ittle invitation to induce me to visit m  good Dublin friendsAnd I shou'd now rej  i  cou  d I change that disagreeable part of conveyance th  ther the sea voyage but indeed I shoul  be m  king so many excursions to Ireland was t  a obst  e re  oved that I should be ruined wi  postchaise hire so I must be contented like  angl  s  and persuade myself all is for the best I  e  t o  er in a dreadful storm they talked of  the horses throats I really thought they  a  e kicked the ship's sides into the sea  w  er the voyage was with difficulty accom  ed and when on shore my gratitude and dan  l  w  re too soon forgot When I was well  I waited on the attractive Mr Barry with  was soon settled for his manners were  My first appearance was fixed on for Bo  s which was to be as soon as the play could  got ready In the course of the first week  a  ng an idle morning I judged it would be pl  a  ant respectful and right to stretch a walk to  my old friend Mr Macklin who then lived  part of DrumcindraLane the very  of Dublin and almost in the cou  try  perhaps that street at this time is situated  middle of Dublin as the village of Mary  ne is in the city of Westminster After my  at the door a lazy servant at length opened  Servants in general there are by no means so  ert as in EnglandI inquired if Mr Mack  was at home He answered  "No Sir indeed  not"  I left a card and my compliments  ▪Mr Wilkinson from England"  but had not one  any yards on my return before the sash of  the diningroom window was thrown swiftly up and Mr Macklin in his red nightcap loudly cried out  "Wilkinson Wilkinson I am at home I am at home come back I want to see you"  I returned on the sudden invitation the door wa opened and up stairs I mounted was escorte  to the diningroom where I had no sooner ent  ed than instead of Mr Macklin  solus  as I expected behind the door which opened inward stood Mr Mossop erect with a sword by his sid  and in full dress After the usual salutations an observations on the weather and how all went o in  ngland c Mr Mossop said grandly he wa very happy in having that opportunity of meetin me as he wanted to mention such proposals f  his theatre for the season as he was certain mu meet with my approbation for they would pro  to me most eligible agreeable and highly profitabl  Mr Macklin urged the matter as his advice f  the good of us both and said he was willing  his part to contribute all in his power to add the proposed union and for the general goo Mr Macklin was at that time engaged with M Mossop I was so circumstanced as impelled  to declare myself obliged to Mr Mossop for  offer but was under the necessity honestly to  him it was then too late I had come over Dublin not positively engaged it was true I  received in England letters from Mr Jefferson first then from Mr Barry while at Chester but had not entered into actual agreement till three days previous to that present one so that I had si  ned and sealed and the matter was irrevokeable Mr Macklin paused looked disappointed and sorryMossop breathed hard rolled his eyes and s  us  ed the air spoke not looked not smiled indignant and with resentment put his hand on his sword his eyes looked terror all was sunk in s  len  e I judged it very improper hastily to depart and he seemed determined not to move and lea  e me with Mr Macklin I was really in a puzzling situation being actually engaged with company at four o'clock at the worthy Corne  us Kelly's in Capelstreet who was then beloved and known by every body and I believe is yet living and must be a surprising age However I sat at Macklin's till five when looking suddenly at my watch I seemed much surprised at the time having passed so swiftly that I had strangely and rudely forgot myself as I was an hour beyond the time of my engagement in Capelstreet and made my bow of departure when Mr Mossop rose up suddenly and said  "Sir I wish to attend you"  On crossing the channels which were remarkably dirty he offered me his hand very politely then suddenly walked on for the space of five or six  minutes when after a tragic ejaculation he stopped and said  "Sir Mr Wilkinson how do you dare to live Sir""Why Sir I do not think it strange my daring but liking to live having su  h pl  nti  l  ables where I am daily made welcome in  ublin with such a number of re  pe  table friend  ""Sir" said Mossop "  ou are going to play in Crowstreet theatre with Barry Sirand Sir I will run you through the body Sir if you take the liberty to attempt my manner by any mimicry on the stage You must promise me Sir on your honour you will not dare  attempt  t If you break that promise Sir you c  nnot live and you Mr Wilkinson must  eas you must mest me the next day and I shall  il you Sir"  I told him it was impossible to co  ply with that his mandate as his threats wou  d of course from necessity and policy have a contrary effect than w  at he expected as by entreaty he would have been more likely to have  ied his point for if it once came to be known  ow he had worked upon my fears there would  ot be  carpenter or dresser in the Dublin theatre o  t wo  ld kick me and as I esteemed Mr Mos  p as a gentleman and as an actor of the firs  minence on any stage if he insisted on the dispate being seriously terminated it would be my ultimate w  sh my  o  i  m  to have an af  air  honour with him in preference to any other gentleman whatever on account of his theatrical consequence as if I was fortunate it would deter many from being impudent and if I fell in battle it must be with eclat as it would be by the hand of so celebrated a tragedian The coolness and serious manner blended with ironical humour with which I delivered that speech to Mossop absolutely staggered him with surprise as instead of the crouching he expected there was an apparent calmness steadiness and determination in what I sa  d At last he spoke the following words  "You dare not take me off Sir or if you do dare not to take me off more than a  little  if you  o  ore Sir you shall die"  He then instantly  parted as majestic as the ghost of Julius Caesar I very swiftly posted and wished for wings to arrive at Capelstreet where I was in good English and Irish well lectured without any opportunity for a long time of making any defence but when breathingtime allowed a possibility for me the culprit to make any vindication and requesting a  r trial and a benevolent jury and relying on the laws of the country for an honourable and just examination though at that time under severe condemnation yet trusting I might be indulged  a candid hearing in my own justification  as not only listened to but most honourably  acquitted and with great approbation for Mossop's pride was so well known that they enjoyed his mortification and blessed be God my veracity was so well believed that though the dinner was spoiled a material circumstance against me and to the feelings of each craving stomach we had a most remarkable cheerful day When the evening grew late Mrs Wilson a sister of Mrs Kelly's who lived as a companion from her childhood with the late Dowager Lady Granard said to me  "Come Tate you have been uncommon good company to day I will not have either chair or coach for I want you as my guard from Capelstreet to Stephen's Green"  which is near the distance from St Clement's church to Sohosquare in London We set off on our parade as she seemed determined to walk it being moonlight and the streets also well lamped though a coach or chair was as easy to command as in any par  of London She often halted as if not well an  said she had something to tell me I urged he  often to inform me what had so apparently affected her she answered she would satisfy my inquiries if I would first escort her to Lord Forbes' in Stephen's Green I perceived her as walkin  up Dawsonstreet particularly agitated and whe  crossing the walk of Stephen's Green the S  James's Park of Dublin for Promenade she complained  of being ill and begged to sit down on one of the benches which I complied with and after much apparent sorrow she said  "My dear Tate faith you have been so lively and entertaining this day and made so many of my friends happy to see you in such great spirits you must have noticed surely every person's care and kind attention to you as more than common though they are your sincere and good wellwishers and not being by any means willing to disturb the pleasant party at my sister's I put on a pleasing countenance with an aching hear of sorrow therefore the lot of conveying ill news is reserved for me"  She then burst into tears and said  "My dear Tate I have received a letter from your mother's dearest wellwisher Lady Forbes truly lamenting the loss of her agreeable intimate friend and old acquaintance your  dear  and  revered  mother with whom she has known many happy days Her Ladyship desired me to assure you Tate that every attendance a person of the highest rank could have required had not been wanting to relieve aid and support her tottering impaired state of health"  Her Ladyship had added that she would herself have been at the expence of sending for me but that my mother had thanked Lady Forbes for the  avour and said as my seeing her agonies could only afflict her son and would add to her own  pangs without answering any purpose she esteemed it as a blessing from God that Tate was at a distance instead of being present at the same time imploring every benediction on her son's head from the Almighty and declaring that her offspring had behaved nobly in his allowance for her comforts of life and to add to his expences or imbitter his mind with sorrow would prevent that peaceful exit to God which she did not dread but approached with reverence and hope awfully relying on his allgracious mercies and she felt consolation in her quitting this earthly abode of sorrow That I was then under the patronage of my Dublin wonderfully good friends and that she in her son's prosperity had INHERITED the utmost wishes and buildings of her fancy Lady Forbes honoured me so far as to take every care of the funeral c herself My mother requested if it might be granted without any extraordinary expence to be laid in the vault of the Savoy Chapel where my father had so many years been a minister but the Rev Mr Wilmot then my father's successor refused the grant unless the expensive fees were complied with which my good mother had prohibited being acquiesced with on any account as she thought her husband who had so long been minister and a grace and honour to the pulpit as a preacher her having an elder son  and two daughters in that vault humanity charity pity and religion might have granted a wife and mother of most amiable and virtuous character in every true sense of the word such a boon but to the shame of the minister Christianity and common feeling it was denied and she was decently and truly mournfully attended by respectable persons and such true friends as were not ashamed to pay a tribute to a woman of as good qualities as ever exalted or honoured Human NatureWere it possible a religious and amiable mind could procure happiness for another in this world my mother's true prayers and petitions presented at the High Throne of Mercy in my behalf would at this time with the Almighty's will have made me one of the most blessed men in this lifeBut we should work ourselves and not trust to the labour of others as the best find that  "strait is the gate and narrow is the path which leads to Heaven"  Mrs Wilson also delivered me a paper inclosed fr  m Lady Forbes wrote by my mother to the following effect which I replete with grief thrust into my pocket being full of distress and agitation f  r Nature will be  ature but her letters to me at  orwich my last farewel the epistle to Chester  had in some measure prepared me for an event expected though not so suddenly but when  choaked with agony at my last seeing her in London she had spiritlike awfully informed me she should never behold me more so that altogether they had certainly been preparatives for the greatest loss that can be known that of an indulgent and good parent As a son I can repeat with truth that I was dutiful and respectful but when children slight an affectionate father or mother they not only give a stab to the parent but open a sluice in their own hearts for the admittance of every iron corrosive and melancholy quality the which will to a certainty one day or other soften what was hard and obdurate and make them truly reflect with Shakspeare  How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is  To have a thankless child  Indeed misfortune seldom pays a visit alone but is too often attended by a crowded procession of ills and vexations which answers one good purpose as it prepares the mind for submission and a proper resignation to quit a life which otherwise with health attended by the gaudy pleasures of the world Nature tugs and makes us unwillingly give up  I retired home to Mr Chaigneau's house in Abbeystreet where I then was till I suited mysel  with a lodging to my mind Mr and Mrs Chaigneau  being that winter at Bath I could not rest but run over the many good acts my mother had done and the many sufferings she had undergone but feeling that truly happy and glowing sensation the inspiration of the Almighty that told me I had acted dutifully and right by having supplied her wants and that her last years were by her confessedly years of happiness and content it reconciled me to myself and when the morning gave a sufficient light I earnestly looked over the paper enclosed to me by Lady Forbes in my mother's handwriting great part of it is here inserted  MY DEAR TATE  HAVING such frequent returns of this giddy disorder in my head though well and free from any complaint at this time yet I must look upon these sudden attacks as most proper warnings that I may resign life in one moment therefore leave this short memorandum of my wearing apparel I would have you divide it between Mrs Judkins and Mrs JackI mean my common gowns linen and such as may be proper for them at your discretion also such petticoats cloaks c as may be warm to that poor old woman Mrs JackI have nothing worth leaving to my best friends As you know them all if any little thing will be acceptable  let the offer come from you particularly to Mrs Batt and Mrs Hutchinson Whether in sickness or in health I feel no reluctance at quitting this world but the separation from my dearly beloved TateIf in my senses my last breath will be imploring God's blessings for all that is truly good to you that the same good Providence may still attend you and that you may ever be defended from all the evils and dangers of the world I pray God to conduct you through life and as I am happy in believing you are blessed with an honest good heart so doubt not but you will give due attention to the plain and easy duties of religion which will be the certain way to secure the favour of God both here and hereafter where may we meet to live for ever in heaven through the merits of Jesus Christ our Lord  Amen  I desire no mark of folly or ridiculous pride may attend me to my bed of dust plain and decent as possible neither any dressed up catalogue of virtues in the news I am at this instant well calm cheerful and happy in good health and spirits and whilst in this world  Your most tender And affectionate mother G WILKINSON  That day I kept closely at home but as soon a  I was mournfully equipped and could appear w  t  decency I went abroad After what had pas  ed with Mr Mossop Mr Jefferson insisted on my not appearing in the streets without a sword which I complied with Those who know me will  augh when they figure to themselves Wilk nson in a black scratch wig parading Dublin  treets with a glaring silverhilted swordTo tho  e who do not recollect or know me I refer to Mrs Bellamy's description in her th volumeShe says  "I will here take the opportunity of adding a short description of the figure manner and d  portment of the gentleman who had been the subject of the foregoing anecdote His person is  ll his countenance rather sportive than beautif  and his manners agreeable As to his theatri  al talen  they are far above the common rank he has infinite merit in comedy and excels in mi  cry  His first appearance was in Dublin in the year  where he remained till the following year  e joined the Edinburgh company in dur  ng the time I had a share in the management of  where by his unremitted application and great mer  t in every line of the drama he rendered him  lf a valuable acquisition to the community To  up the whole of his character in a few words  he has always been justly admired as an actor beloved as a man and esteemed as a friend"  Well said Mrs Bellamy THAT I read much more palatably than the  unasked opinion  of Mr Stephen Kemble who honoured me with the following from Exeter  My apothecary at Exeter who is one of the best creatures in the world and never charges for his physic says he remembers you at Exeter when you was a handsome looking young fellow I said I thought he must be mistaken in the person or that at all events it must have been long agoIndeed there is a particular time of lit  when every body looks well at least if not handsomeThough I must confess he is the only person whom I ever heard connect the word handsome with Tate Wilkinson For my part  think you as ugly as any subject in h  Majesty'  dominionsBut as I observed before i  migh  be then your welllooking time  This paragraph for fear you should think m  impertinent I shall not sign Kemble but  VERITAS  I should have imagined Mr Kemble's lette  meant rudely but that it contained matter of importance to him and me being no less than th  foundation for a treaty that was afterwards negotiating  seriously for all my theatrical property but that gentleman not approving what I asked and myself not relishing by any means the sums he offered the matter dropped after a few weeks consideration Mrs Wilkinson has seen luckily for me with my eyes not Mr Kemble's which undoubtedly is  a blessing to herself  Digression is so natural to my disposition it is in vain for me to attempt correcting it so little are we acquainted with our own peculiarities I had not known a wandering imagination possessed me in so strong a degree had not Mr Robertson late of the York company in high estimation as a worthy welleducated sensible man and was a most excellent comedian frequently warned me of it in my memoirs So a stranger need only take up Mr Foote's comedy of the Cozeners and in Mr Aircastle as drawn by that gentleman he will find a strong trait of Tate WilkinsonThe following lines of Mr Aircastle's are a specimen and I often have recourse to that comedy for a peep at my own singularities  The COZENERS  "Aye aye you officers play the very deuce when you come down into the country I remember Ensign Sash about ten years agohis father came from BarbadoesI met him at Treacle's  the great sugarbaker's who had a house in St Mary Axehe took the lease from Alderman Gingham who served sheriff with DeputyThere w  s tight work on the hustingsThough when I first came to the Temple there was a lawyer's wife that lived in QualityCourt that I was exceed ngly fond ofHer hu  band came home one night and I crept under the bed where I should have remained concealed but for a little dog of Charles's breed he went bow wow wow Indeed a man and wife to quarrel before folks is rather rudi  h I own by ourselves indeed it is a pretty innocent amu  ement enough Tom Test of  ur town used to say his wife was a Devonshire girl if I am not mistaken from Plymouth There by the bye they have the best John Dorees in England Old Quin one  ummer went thither on purpose"  When the gloom of the melancholy event and my natural reveries had subsided I went eagerly to work in preparing the Rehearsal and myself in Bayes  hen I  irst acted it at Crowstreet I gave a likeness of Mossop in the lines of  "So boar and sow when any storm is nigh c"  which being well executed of course had good effect  In act the third where I was correcting an actor I hit off some words and directions pointedly  in the manner of my friend Mr Macklin not supposing but he would laugh at it as he had often encouraged me to proceed with my mischievous tricks and I used to entertain him with such matterIt was immediately noticed and well taken The next day Mr Barry sent for me to give me information that Mr Macklin armed  à pè  on horseback had called on him and addr  sed him in the following words  "Sir I h  ar Wilkinson took some liberty with my manner of acting last night on your theatre I do not tr  uble myself about the boy for every affront or j  e passed on your stage I shall look upon as authorised by you and if such a practice is again repeated or attempted I shall seriously expect you to answer for it"  Barry assured him he might depend on Mr Wilkinson's being informed of his com  aint and might rest satisfied no repetition of the  rt should be again exhibited On which Mr Macklin remounted his rosinante and like Don Quixote having killed his puppet giant he ret  rned in triumph Mr Barry informed me he had p  wned his honour as surety I would not be a n  ughty boy a second time  "Now my dear Wi  ki  son" added Barry smiling "I beg you wi l b  observant and let me really depend on your  t drawing me into a scrape particularly as I  to you I think Macklin will come to church  again"  which the next season actually happened as he once more acted his Sir Archy to Barry's Sir Callaghan which was excellent I reassured Mr Barry he need not urge seriously what was my wish to comply with as for Mr Macklin I retained the highest regard and he had ever been kind and improving me by his advice and observations and I really believe had Mr Macklin been present he would have laughed instead of being offended but Fame increasing as she goes had formed the trifle I had done ere it reached Mr Macklin into a story perhaps as ridiculous as false and probably formed to the size of enormity and there that matter rested  But with Mr Mossop I really had no mercy and though he was confessedly an actor of merit and wonderful powers the most melodious clear voice I ever heard take it for all in all yet his manner was so peculiar that I fear as I got fame at his expence I rather decreased than increased his as it certainly led several enthusiastic admirers to distinguish foibles and oddities not before so discernible I really did expect in consequence of the great freedoms I had taken Mr Mossop would certainly have called me to an account and daily apprehended I should have a message or visit  Mr Jefferson now at Exeter who loved a little mischief said to him one day  "Sir I was last night at Crowstreet where Wilkinson in Tragedy AlaMode and in Bayes had taken very great liberties indeed and added that the audience were illnatured enough to be highly entertained"  on which Mossop snuffed the air put his hand on his sword and turning upon his heel replied  "Yes  Sir  but he only takes  me off a  ttle  "  and made his angry departure After which Jefferson never again renewed the subject but was astonished after his repeated and open threats of vengeance he had not acted more cons  tently And after the said Mr Jefferson's telling me that circumstance I never heard more of Mr Mossop's sword pistol or anger  I played a great number of nights with Mr Barry that season and had a lucrative second engagement as my first finished December I acted repeatedly Wolsey Oakly Tragedy Ala  ode Cadwallader Bayes cAnd when Mr Sheridan that winter who had not been seen from the time of his banishment occasioned by Barry's and Woodward's opposition his long absence and a general respect being paid him gave success to Barry and a severe blow to Mossop as he had then lost every tragic support Mrs Fitzhenry having returned once more to Crowstreet and  Mrs Abington was engaged in London Mossop's only support was Mr Macklin's Shylock Love AlaMode c and Miss Catley who then occasioned much conversation and fashion gave the old Beggar's Opera a new run and allured several audiences Macklin acted Peachum But Mr Sheridan not having performed in Dublin from his desertion in till late in the year made him not only from grateful and honourable feelings well received for the wellknown injuries he had sustained as a gentleman and more so from malevolent party and prejudice as the darling actor of the hearts in general of that metropolisNot that I should have voted or assigned the chair of Roscius to speak candidly in favour of Mr Sheridan against Barry or Moss  p particularly not against the formerMr Sheridan drew several overflowing housesHe acted Hamlet his established particular character for his benefit by the universal desire of his friends and he actually sent a card to me requesting I would obl  ge him by studying the Apprentice which I had never played for his night which I agreed to with pleasure as I ever held Mr Sheridan respectable and indeed the consequence turned out an obligation to myself as my performing that character though immediately after the mer  t of the justly admired Woodward  was not only much relished but perpetually called for and in London the ensuing season did wonders for me and might be termed my  chef d'oeuvre  there Mr Mossop I did not neglect when I was in my apprenticeshipAnd strange to tellbut men are men the best sometimes forgetMr Sheridan came to return me thanks for the favour and to wish me joy of my applause and rejoicingly told me all his friends were particularly pleased and himself had been highly entertained with my strong likeness of Mr Mossop Here is a striking instance of Human Nature for if the reader will but turn his memory round to my first winter in Ireland he will recollect how more than pointedly austere Mr Sheridan was against mimicry and me with his particular severity on jokes and freedoms of that nature  My benefit was on Monday December The Mourning Bride Osmyn by Mr Barry the King by Mr Wilkinson Zara by Mrs Fitzhenry Almeria by Mrs DancerWith by particular desire The Prodigal's Return  n the manner of the original Tragedy AlaMode also Fielding's Pleasures of the Town or he Puppet ShewThe bills passed Mr Bary's ordeal and naturally may be supposed to have een quartered upon three parts of the Dublin inabitants besides all my boxes being taken by my  friends and the public and the great call for tickets made them more universally dispersed This if you are a theatrical reader I beg you will notice was the very winter Woodward had broke his connection as manager with Barry and had spoken his prologue of the Prodigal returned at London and had been received with open arms at his former residence of Elysium That Prologue if I had properly considered certainly was a dangerous and wanton undertaking and therefore should have required thought as it indubitably might have drawn me into a predicament which if taken offensively might to a certainty have turned out so serious that all my friends combined could not have extricated me from the bad consequences as offence is sooner conceived than forgiven and too many people like being offended to gratify by such opportunity their darling spleen and illnature and even acquaintances are liable to sway with the opinion of the multitude to prove thei  impartiality which often makes lukewarm friend  the most dangerous of enemies that can be conceived as their desertion is made subservient b  artful insinuations to become useful  for base purposes  About five days before my benefit Mr Barr  called on me in great perturbation and said Mr Woodward had informed him by letter that i  London on looking over the Dublin Journal he to his astonishment had seen his Prodigal prologue advertised to be spoken by Mr Wilkinson and in his mannerThat he expected and requested to have that part of the bill expunged as it might greatly injure him and he also judged it a service of danger to Mr WilkinsonHe made a point of it the more as he intended he added to perform a few nights in the spring on his own stage in Crowstreet and he feared Mr Wilkinson's whim might have a perilous tendency I felt the force of truth and not meaning injury should have been unhappy to have occasioned any My bills were immediately altered and what Mr Woodward had surmised to be offensive was directly taken out and its not being in the future bills great or small I never thought more of what I con  idered merely as a trifling matter  That night December though I had been honoured with many good ones notwithstanding Mr and Mrs Chaigneau were absent was  he best I ever had in Dublin the receipt being The last music was called about the usual time  nd was playing to that bumper of a house which finished and the curtain rising to melting notes and as Mrs Dancer was impatiently expecting her usual plaudits from every hand stick and voice the contrary burst forth with most horrid din and  vociferation and to her astonishment the universal cry was  "Off offWilkinson Wilk  nson Woodward's prologue"  c Mrs Dancer attempted to courtesy and speak but all in vain she was compelled to retire full of grief rage shame anger and vexationFor my part I was dressed all trim for his Majesty and thinking to command as a king and not be commanded  was petrisied like Lord Ogleby and almost distilled to jelly by my fears Barry summoned me in high rage and the audience continued all the while in tumult Mrs Dancer flew into a violent passion for what she had sustained on my account Barr  said he was certain I had wilfully occ  sioned the riot and planted persons to call for the prologue I replied on my honour that I had strictly obeyed his commands and from the moment he had mentioned my not doing it I never more gave the fatal prologue a thought and urged what was truth that my very dress for the king of Portugal made my assertions evident therefore Mr Glover late Dr Glover in Fleetstreet who was then engaged as an actor with Mr Barry's directions went forward and after much bowing intreating c was at length suffered to inf  rm them that Mr Wilkinson was then dressed for the King and actually was not prepared for the prologue it having been judged improper in the highest degree and  purposely omitted not only in the bills of the day but for the whole week past  Benefits were then advertised three weeks before the Night  There  ore Mr Barry and Mr Wilkinson respectfully hoped the omission would be pardoned approved and excused The answer was not only universal but as if one determined voice  "No no noNo play no play No benefit unless he speaks the prologue"  Barry began then to be  eriously alarmed as it bore the marks of determination not to be trifled with he alledged so situated Mr Woodward himself could not be angry when properly informed and said  "Well Wi  kinson I do not blame youI see evidently it is a formed party of angry enemies against Woodward so speak the prologue as well as you can"  Mr Glover then informed the audience I would  peak the prologue and endeavour to recollect it against the finish of the play but  "No no" was the cry and answer"The prologue now or no play"  I felt myself in a situation very alarming I had no alternative and really not having attended to the prologue after giving up every idea of it to recollect what I had conned over was very difficult having never spoke it nor having t  e  east imagination of its ever being such a serious matter of contentionOnce more Mr Glover was deputed and underwent a peal of groans and hisses but  being again permitted to be heard he said if they would honour Mr  ilkinson with the indulgence of a few minutes to change his dress and collect himself he would exert his abilities and speak the prologue as well as he was capable The theatre refounded approbation and  "Yes yesbravo bravo"  I do not think in any dramatic occurrence I ever was so truly overpowered I took a half pint of Madeira and that assistance before I thought of the prologue actually inspired me to repeat these lines  Valour soars above  What the world calls misfortune and affliction  These are not ills else would they never fall  On Heaven's first favourites and the best of men  The gods in bounty work up storms about us  That give mankind occasion to exert  Their hidden strength and throw out into practic  Virtues which shun the day and lie concealed  In the smooth seasons and the calms of life  The above allusion was conceited but I w  young and the whim struck my fancy The id  of consequence I had agreeably placed myself i  by that repetition however strutting and fantastical aided by the good heartening Madeira tune my mind to some degree of composure I stripp  with alacrity and put on an old grey frock a pa  of blue boot stockings my scratch wig c an  quickly transformed myself and thus equipped with hat in hand advanced to take the field but however quick as I had been the patience of the audience were tired and suspecting more imposition as they termed it let me know they were all there and I naturally conceived they had not entirely forgot my slip mentioned in when they promised retaliation which perhaps might have conspired to render the said mentioned prologue considered as a matter of more moment than otherwise it would have been However I was certainly the unlucky  Busy Body  The music played and the bell at last was rung They were soon all seated and silence loudly proclaimed Be it observed that Mr Woodward when he spoke that prologue first at Covent Garden after an absence of a few years popped his head on the stage from the door drew himself hastily away as if ashamed of being such a prodigal son as to leave his good friends and not know when he was well He next crept on by the curtain peeping and then hiding his face again till he attained the centre of the stage which was wittingly conceived and had a happy effect So on my approach that night I practised the same manoeuvre but as in imitation of Woodward and not owing to my own bright thought The audience on my first approach and drawing back as above described  half hissedhalf applauded but o  my second and third advance alamode Woodward the approbation arose to a degree equal almost to Woodward's reception at Covent Garden for they apprehended all my acted modesty was a  natural  impromptu and a tacit confession of shame for keeping them so long waiting and having meant artfully to deprive them of that part of the evening's entertainment they were determined to hear and all in compliance to the bashaw order of the manager however my pardon was fully proclaimed long before I spoke by peals of laughter and applause and I felt very differently from the hour before that pleasing altered situation and what is no more strange than true they with infinite good humour approved almost every line of the prologue as if it had been calculated to compliment the Dublin audience instead of the contrary and I may venture to say Mr Woodward was certainly to blame when he wrote and spoke it  But men in rage strike those who love them best  For though he might be right in sound judgment to return to London he could easily have studied means to have paid court and obtained pardon and support on his going back to the station where he had formerly been for many years an established favourite without inconsiderately and ungratefully  throwing re  ections on those who had ever respected his worth as a man and his merit as an actor of eminence His view in quitting London was gain as was his returning and he was like to stand the hazard of that die he himself had purposely thrown As I have said so much relative to the prologue I will here insert it and I hope not with impropriety  BEHOLD the prodigal  return'd  quite  tam    And though you'll hardly think it full of  stame  Asham'd  so long t'have left my patrons here  On random schemesthe Lord knows  what  and  where  With  piteous  face long stranger to a  grin    Receive the

 Ambition  drove me to the grand mistake  Ambition  made me  mad  enough to roam  But now I feel with joy that  home  is  home    Faith they put  powder in my drink  d'ye see  Or else by  Pharaoh's

the part still  o'er  and  o'er  But never BE the BUSY BODY more  I thought all that prologue business well over and was to play Cardinal Wolsey shortly afterQueen Catherine Mrs Fitzhenry as Mr Foote had sent Barry over the new farce of the Mayo  of Garratt it occasioned me a second engagemen  with him for ten nights more On my entranc  as the Cardinal to my astonishment there was a  universal cry for Woodward's prologue nor would they let me or the play proceed till I advanced an  said  "Gentlemen as soon as I am dead I wil  certainly speak it"  The oddity of my Irish blunder set them into a laugh and all was right til  the play was over then it was not forgot but fo  fear I should give them the slip was loudly calle  for  In a few days the Mayor of Garratt was ready which with puffing and extracts from the London papers brought a crowded house I was equipped exactly in Mr Foote's manner for Major Sturgeon and pleased myself with the effect my figure would have on my first entrance as the Major for the piece being quite new was a feather in my cap and I was in high spirits on the occasion but notwithstanding the novelty and expectation of much entertainment from the new farce no sooner was the curtain drawn up than that cursed unfortunate and tormenting prologue was again called for by every bod  and  "WilkinsonPrologue prologue Wilkinson"  resounded from every part of the theatreA person not acquainted with the stage may perhaps not think this any particular hardship but an actor will feel  t to be as I myself found it really a piece of ill fortune and very distressing Let any brother comedian suppose himself welldressed for a remarkable character dependent partly on that dress and that the first night too of a new comedy in which he expected fame and profit and one half the effect depending on his first appearanceBut this prologue they would haveI refusedbut was obliged to go on and pleadAll arguing was in vain and what was worse in that prologue I was to  omplain of want and penury c and should  have been in a very indifferent dress yet they wished me to speak it with a stuffed belly rosy cheeks and in a great pair of French boots No remonstrances would availI urged my boots as an excuse but they only laughed aloud and said  "Never mind Major speak it in your boots"  I thought some planet had unwitted menI was obliged to submit and was so far in character as the Prodiga that I felt more inclined to cry than laugh After that disagreeable ceremony the farce proceeded on was highly received and acted six or seven nights but never without their favourite prologue let me have acted what I would nay had I played Lady Townly or Juliet I am certain I must have spoke it However custom reconciles many disagreeable things in life which at first appear not only disgustful but painful so this prologue by use I at length repeated perfectly easy let me be dressed as I would and as  "what must be must be"  I was prepared for the summons Barry wished me to continue as he urged I was much more established there as a performer than at any other period and that favour from the public at large without being in the least dependent on my particular friends yet things happen so contradictory that it must appear strange to say that the trifling prologue had so teized me it was the only time I ever quitted Dublin witho  t  regret and at the very period I loved that place  he most At the end of January I left that city and took my route the north road by Drogheda Newry Carrickfergus and Belfast to Donogadee  But before I take leave of the prologue business entirely I must beg permission to give the sequel and catastrophe to it and I hope I shall be forgiven for my tautology and tediousness respecting it  Mr Woodward went over to Ireland late in the spring season he was advertised to play and to secure his former footing his first appearance was announced for a public charity benefit when a rumour was whispered and of course soon circulated about Mr Woodward's prodigal prologue spoken in London at Covent Garden theatre and so often repeated by Wilkinson to the audience in Dublin during the winter months of playing It may be readily conje  tured that foolish business was not a little pushed forwards by the opposite interests connected with the Mossopian theatre and actors can in spite of nature now and then give a lift to irritation and spleen in public taverns c particularly if things are not agreeable to themselves at the time Not but there are as worthy and superior minds of both sexes to be found in a theatre as in any other set of people whatever but when we judge in general  of mankind wo be to the safety of those who trust their security in the state of reliance on humanity honour and goodnaturethough it is said charity covereth a multitude of sins yet Woodward's coat of mail and merit on this occasion would not avail it was not only penetrable stuff but furiously threatened with assassination on all sides as they judged it a flimsy pretext to hide or conceal a conscientiousness of his fault and a gross affront to the city of Dublin at large  The playing for a charity for his first appearance was a poor subterfuge and made bad worse as they all knew his real view and intent was profit they therefore termed that a paltry evasion and a tacit confession of guilt and fear and on the day of his intended performance the said prologue was actually printed as spoken by the  grateful  Henry Woodward therefore all the lines they had noted when I spoke it they locked safe in the volumes of their brains and such as they took to be offensive and affrontive were marked in the fresh printed ones in Italicshere  potatoes  another line  turnips  and at last  banished from those boards  The matter wore so serious an aspect that Mr Woodward and his friends thought it prudent and adviseable for him to decline playing there that night or any other on that he speedily retreated not making his appearance even in the streets for fear of being  insulted nor did he ever visit Ireland to play again  I am vexed at relating this because it was occasioned by a foolish wantonness on my part attended with perplexity and vexation to myself and followed with such serious consequences to Mr Woodward as never could have entered my headIt hurt me the more as I really regarded him muchit occasioned a great coolness and ironical distance between us for an interval which was natural and unavoidable But reflection and time made us reconciled and restored us not only to our former acquaintance but to a much stronger intimacy than before and a sincere friendship which truly continued till that moment which separates king and people husband and wife father and sonand all the world  Mr Woodward was a gentleman of true worth and not undeserving the sigh of any person however exalted as he undoubtedly was an honourable member of society and an actor while within memory whose merits cannot  must not  be forgotten His Marplot Bobadil and Flash will be for years enrolled in stage history  I now must travel to Donogadee and from thence to Edinburgh but I was obliged to continue three or four days the wind not answering directly for Scottish steeragethe distance I guess  is nearly the same as between Dover and Calai  or perhaps rather more packets appointed by Government have now rendered that passage more commodious and sa  e and traverse to and fro in regular course which affords great temptations to ladies and gentlemen not fond of a sea voyage When I unluckily adventured over in the depth of winter it was in a storm accompanied by snow with all its horrid attendants and in an open wherry no shelter whatever from the inclemency of weather the sailors all drunk twenty pigs and sows with horses and a methodist preacher Whether he or the possessed  wine raised the tempest I cannot determineI rather suppose the Fates However we rushed on the rocks on the opposite shore which is remarkably rugged with a force that seemed to me astonishing they said it was the usual manner of landing at Port Patrick Indeed though I was six hours the passage in general I believe is performed in less time and I am informed is rendered pleasant and convenient for the weary traveller and besides these allurements its shortness and an almost certainty of safety an accident being seldom heard of but mine was an instance to encourage wayfarers to pass that way as then conveniences were never thought ofThe wherry in the storm almost guided itselfa drunken crewno shelter from  th  severity of climateyet the actor the preacher the sailors the sows and pigs horses c all arrived safe on the Scotch shore If the escape was owing to the particular good qualities of the medley groupe I fear the drunken sailors would have the superior claim allowed to them as they undisguised exposed their unthinking folly while it was possible the methodist and the dramatic were both actors had a Jew been in the boat he would probably have imputed the storm to th  herd of swine  I do confess without asking belief I was glad of a supper in an hut called an inn and to get a night's rest there that said hut is now transformed to a decent place of reception for strangers There was not at that period a tolerable road or any regular track for near forty miles nor any mode of travelling but on little starved horses and a wild guide to Glasgow now there are postchaisesHowever I accomplished my journey on horseback in two days the first night to Aire the second to Glasgow it rained heavily and was accompanied with hail snow and every concomitant severe weather could give I felt much for the guide who carried my luggage but he appeared perfectly contented whilst I seemed ready to give up the ghost but the beholding the spires of the noble  ity of Glasgow recruited my almost exhausted spirits till by dint of labour I at last about ten at night arrived in that truly elegant built cityIt was far superior to Edinburgh and has greatly improved but in point of rapid grandeur in building and improvement  Edinburgh has given Glasgow a Somerset surprise so as to baffle all comparison and now stands foremost as one of the most beautiful corporate towns in Europe  I was truly ill when I go  to the Bull Inn and actually from fatigue extended myself on the carpet before the fire but good wine good supper good bed good every thing made me feel in heaven Next day I took a postchaise and in the evening reached Edinburgh and stopped at an inn in the Grass Market very indifferent indeed in every respect as to accommodation or neatness which gave me a bad opinion of the capital city of Scotland  Edinburgh is romantically and pleasantly situated indeed more so than can be imagined or described nor has even Bath or any other town or city within my knowledge made such rapid strides towards improvement as the new town of Edinburgh The new streets hotels superb squares c are astonishing but added to all those elegancies in the winter season the town is well lighted throughout Thi  description will make  a narrowminded Cockney stare who thinks green peas were never seen in Scotland and supposes all the inhabitants live on barleybroth haggass and crowdy and has confirmed his notions by surmising Edinburgh to be a dirty mean place but if he will travel and take a peep it will open his eyes and make him confess with surprise astonishment and conviction that it with justice lays claim to being placed in a station that evinces superiority and demands a rank as a city of eminence admiration consequence and distinction In point of elegance and spirit there is no such city in the kingdom of Great Britain except London and Bath But reader observe Edinburgh was not in the state I have been endeavouring to describe when I first arrived there in Feb It was then merely confined to the old town and destitute of many of those elegancies it now possessesto a degree of luxury and extravagance in every respect On my setting down at Edinburgh I neither had engagement nor acquaintance with any person whatever theatrical or otherwise but had gone there at hap hazard and removed myself four hundred miles from London into a strange country and took that wonderful circumbendibus to North Britain uninvited merely from my own whim and inclinationbut on inquiry was highly pleased to find my old friend  Mrs Bellamy was there with whom I had not only dined at Mr Calcraft's when she lived in Parliamentstreet but had been on an intimacy for years by seeing her constantly as a visitor at Lady Tyrawley's at SomersetHouse near the Savoy who regarded Mrs Bellamy much as a supposed natural daughter of Lord Tyrawley's though his Lordship had proved a false mate to his wedded lady who though a woman of high sense and breeding could not boast of any personal attraction as she was shortsighted squinted and was in her person rather bordering on the extravagance of caricature but was friendly generous sensible and humane and ever honoured my father and mother as a constant kind companion and good neighbour She possessed more of Cibber's Lady Dainty in respect to cats dogs and monkeys than any other that ever came within the scope of my discernment Indeed her apartments at SomersetHouse were truly disagreeable to enter and when in not without some danger or apprehension at least from the variety of animals as there were loose monkeys and a file of yelping dogs to pass before one could get to the room and then to a chair and an affront to any one of those favourites was truly so to her ladyship and not to be forgiventhere were neve  s than three or four monkeys dressed in regimentals or as fine ladies and gentlemenBut no pen however able can possibly exaggerate her propensity to this tribe as if selected against a second flood On Mrs Bellamy's knowing me so long by meetings at Lady Tyrawley's c I was no sooner announced in Scotland than most friendly received and a general  insisted  invitation to make a home of her house and Mr Bellamy's alias Digges at Bonnington during my stay in Edinburgh It is a pleasant village situated little more than a mile from the town but now I dare say nearly connected by the additional streets and buildings Mr Digges was certainly the most polite gentleman in the world to his ladies and not choosing to have Mrs Digges's name in the bills for living together in Scotland constitutes a marriage while in that kingdom he most graciously exchanged his name of Digges for Bellamy also let that lady perform whatever character she would she was always placed at the head of the bill as for instanceThis day Romeo and Juliet  Juliet Mrs Bellamy Romeo Mr Bellamy  On being introduced into the green  oom I met with little neat Mrs Mozeen my Portsmouth Desdemona who by the name of Edwards had been bred carefully up and introduced  to the London audience by Mrs Clive who was so partial to her adoption that she for the first time gave up Polly which she would not do to Mrs Cibber and acted Lucy which was beyond compare on producing her own taught Polly but Mrs Mozeen's powers were weak and she fell by tasting the apple like her mother eve and the chaste the comical the enraged Clive discarded her and resumed Polly herself and let her pupil down the wind to prey on Fortune  Mrs Mozeen whom I believe I have mentioned as being a favourite actress at Portsmouth in was at Edinburgh under the wings of a long tall Northumberland manager of Edinburgh whose name was  Dowson  cojointly with a Mr Bates Edinburgh Dowson had like a true  lovyer  sacrificed all his business and good situation at Newcastle to prostrate himself with offerings of incense and gaudy mock trappings of false silver and gold lace at the feet of his theatrical princess which at last ended in his wilful ruinThis was in the time of the old theatre in Cannongate long before the present new one or even the New Town was either built or thought onMrs Mozeen had a plurality of lovers and alwa  s put me in mind of Shakespear's lines  Behold yon simpering lady she who starts at  Pleasure's name and thinks her ear prophaned with  The least wanton word wou'd you believe it c  And so it was with that lady for at the least sudden joke she blushed to such a degree as to give the beholder pain for an offence not meant or intended  A Miss Wordly also was there whom Mrs Bellamy has mentioned in her apology as being termed the  Goddess of Nonsense  as a compliment to her being remarkably the contrary But there my friend Bellamy forgot herself as indeed she often tripped with her memory for Miss Wordly was called the  Goddess of Nonsense  by acting that part for my benefit in a farce of Fielding's entitled The Pleasures of the Town and was so christened by Mr Aickin who was then in Edinburgh in high and deserved estimation and with whom I had the satisfaction of  many many  happy days or rather evenings not omitting our Scotch pint of claret and neither of us averse to Madeirato the latt  r I then and now give the preference particularly recollecting one hour's laugh with him on my nearly breaking my neck by a fall into the coal cellar I could have prophesied he would from his spirited manner then have been more fortunate if properly supported on his first onset in London in an animated and lively line but it  may be better as it is for he is now playing what he might at this time have had to study as years will creep which neither Aickin nor Wilkinson can prevent therefore it makes his present time the more easy and pleasant and  "All is well that ends well"  is a good motto for us stage players  The third day of my being in Edinburgh I had a card of invitation from Mr Dowson and Mr David Bates managers to sup with them at a tavern I was entertained very respectfully and in the course of casual conversation Mr Dowson who was the monied manager just then asked me what terms I required for eight or ten nights said they could not afford any thing extravagant as I had come uninvited which should never be done and at the very prime part of the season when they wanted not any foreign aid Besides Mr Dowson said and with truth Mr and Mrs Bellamy were towers of strength I easily surmised by that conversation they meant to be very courtierlike and civil but wanted not any engangement that was likely to cost them any thing I found I had undertaken an expensive tedious journey merely on speculation and condemned myself as having acted wrong in so doing and really thought I might as well have been lucratively paid at that time by Mr Barry who had had me at his bedside requesting me to stay a  month longer in Dublin even though I had been made to speak Woodward's prologue against the grain for Mr Barry then wanted every assistance he being confined by a rheumatism few persons experienced equally painful as himself The Scotch managers and I parted very civilly but no hint of terms for an engagement on either sideThe day following at dinner with Mr Digges or Mr Bellamywhich ever appellation the reader likes bestI informed him and his lady what had passed and that it had determined me to quit Scotland immediately Mrs Bellamy replied that what the managers had told me was the exact state of facts as they then stood  "And" said she "as Mr Bellamy and myself are concerned in the  profits  in one interest and as we settle all the plays we do not want you Mr Wilkinson as it is evident you have thrown yourself into their power if you play at all and if not you have no alternative but to depart and make better use of your time as you certainly can for Bates and Dowson undoubtedly think as you are on the spot you will not neglect any decent engagement But my friend Tate" continued she "you are sure I wish you well from my long knowledge of you and if you will for once depend on my advice and stay over Saturday or Monday next a wonderful change may  happen in the movements of the theatrical machine that will astonish Bates and Dowson and you may command your own terms at present they are sure they can do without you but Sunday next will cause a contrary opinion" I was much surprised and begged Mrs Bellamy to be explicit "Why" said she "Tate I will prove myself explicit and honourable to you as I can rely on your secrecyThere is a law in force in Scotland that if any person whatever is in debt and known to be quitting the kingdom they can arrest even on a Sunday on oath being first made Mr Digges is much involved here and is so unfortunately circumstanced at this juncture that he cannot possibly continue longer without loss of libertyOn Saturday night Mr Digges will on some pretext get all the cash he can from Mr Still the treasurerDowson is not destitute of property and must pay the actorsMr Digges will by Sunday night be secretly and securely conveyed out of their reach and safe on the other side the Tweed in Old EnglandOn Monday Bates and Dowson will be in the utmost consternation and their only relief will be that of requesting your assistance"  The event turned out exactly as Mrs Bellamy's secret advice had painted and on the prophecied Monday they were obliged to offer me  unasked two clear benefits who a week before would not have given one without the charges being duly paid into their coffers instead of my purse  The Minor was first resolved on next the Mayor of Garratt both were quite newMrs Cole was rather thought improper also Dr Squintum as touching on matters there judged too seriousbut I was very fashionable and all was right but Major Sturgeon was the favouriteI acted in various plays and farces from Richard Bayes c to the Lyar in short I played many good parts and was received with candour and much approbation Mrs Bellamy had two benefits and both much honoured in the compliments they paid her on those nightsHer first was the FuneralI acted Trim Mrs Bellamy Lady Brumpton Campley Mr AickinHer second night was the Orphan of China Zamti Mr Wilkinson  tan Mr Aickin Mandane Mrs Bellamy Hamet was to have been acted by Mr Collins who has given the public at London and elsewhere much entertainment by his Brush he was taken ill and the part was obliged to be substituted by Mr Creswick's goodnaturedly reading that character The accident not only hurt the play but Mr Collins as Mrs Bellamy in an acrimonious apology and manner represented  to the audience that Mr Collins purposely distressed the representation and in plain terms told them nought but malevolence and illbehaviour was the true cause of the disappointment I have no reason to imagine her accusation was truly or illfounded but that was the colour she gave it and because frequent illness sudden and lasting we are all subject to  I was soon well acquainted with several leading gentlemen particularly with Mr Nicholson Swetart who was then universally known and as well remembered from London to Edinburgh and at every public place of resort as any worthy spirited gentleman can be and in consequence respected in the three kingdomsHe possessed liberality and that goodness of heart above all to be recorded which many may envy but few very few can equal and felt the dramatic furor in a degree like Mr Vapid not to be surpassed which I mention as no dishonour to himself as an admirer of Shakspe  re and Garrick but to his own fame as a mind full of liberality and understanding and pay only a just tribute in such declaration  My days and hours at that period were very happily engaged and always when not with company was certain of an agreeable party with Mrs Bellamy My obligations at Edinburgh were extended beyond mediocrity and in the course of  my repeated visits to that city exceed the limits of expressing a proper acknowledgment  My first benefit there was on the th of March  The Way to keep him Tragedy AlaMode Bucks have at ye All with Duke and no Duke Lovemore Trapolin c by Mr Wilkinson Widow Belmour Mrs Bellamy  My second the last night of the season I acted King Lear and had the farce of the Pleasures of the Town aided by Miss Wordly's Goddess of Nonsense I was not only satisfied but even delighted with my expedition to Canny Edinburgh and indeed from my frequent visits to that place has occurred the most enviable and pleasing consequences which on reflection must ever be delightful to my memory such as renewing my acquaintance there which repaid my journies with every agreeable advantage an increase of friends a kind reception great and honourable benefits freely attended to with many highbestowed compliments which has left behind an indelible mark of gratitude on my heart that no filer or artist can ever deface only the slow and sure hand of Time that moulders even matters of magnitude to ashes and dust  The Edinburgh season ended Mrs Bellamy wished me to proceed on an expedition then forming for a new theatre at Glasgow just finished  but I at that time was in a bad state of health and therefore declined it as added to indisposition I wished once more to review my London apartments which I had not had the opportunity of seeing from the time of my mother's death and where all the furniture clothes c were safely and honourably secured by the undoubted care and regard of Mrs Alcock in Little Bedfordstreet in the Strand and of course I had some matters of business to settle Indeed I grew worse and worse in health and on leaving Edinburgh by slow stages like Cardinal Wolsey choosing a great comparison expected just to reach London and die in earnest on my late mother's bed  Mrs Bellamy and the company had set off for the west of Scotland GlasgowI set off South for my destined home but intended to halt at my good friend's Mr Baker of the York theatreI was so very ill that five or six days were necessary even with difficulty to accomplish the journey When the afflictive  tour  was achieved I at noon found that good old gentleman busy with bricks and mortar and in his high glory giving directions to workmen who were erecting  part  of a new theatre at York at a great and his sole expence It was intended to be as it now actually is on a much more capacious scale than the old one though nearly on the same spot as h  was then  finishing the tail of the new while the players were employed in the head of the old Mr Baker laughed on seeing me and exulted on valuing himself the younger man in point of comparison I was so emaciated which joking apart he was seriously sorry to behold  That night was the first benefit a Mr and Mrs Powell had at YorkThe Merchant of Venice in which Mr Powell acted Gratiano and Mrs Powell PortiaMr Powell was a York manMrs Powell a woman of a good and respectable family in Warwickshire Mr Baker requested me much to rouse my spirits and play a few nights As I ever was ready to grasp at a benefit and be touching the cash to prevent running out and did not dislike the fatigue of playing I consented and on Saturday April fixed on Othello for my opening characterIt was to have been for the benefit of Mrs Quin I was daily abused at York for attempting Mr Frodsham's part of Othello When the day came I was after dinner taken so dreadfully ill that I never expected to play more Mr Frodsham was not to be found to supply my place and the audience were obliged to be dismissed and as the world is too fond of any tale that feeds its appetite for scandal however gross absurd and even impossible so in that instance did I suffer most inhumanly by the falsehoods  propagated relished and believed without a trait of truth to lead to the matter First it was asserted I was afraid to appear conscious of my having picked their pockets at York on my Tea benefit the year before next that Mr Baker and I had drank half pints of rum and wine till we were so int  xicated that both were carried to bed speechless nay the matter was carried so far that I had a letter of condolance from Mr Foote lamenting and reproaching me for having been drove from the York stage for attempting to play when so infamously drunk that I could neither speak nor stand So these different tales of scandal were all sent piping hot north south east and west and the simple matter of fact was neither more nor less than my being truly and dangerously ill So instead of pity I heard of nothing but reproach spite unmerited abuse and malevolence But as we who live to please must please to liveI consoled myself when I heard such rabblelike opinion with the idea of Coriolanus  Ye common cry of curs whose breaths I did  Despise as reek o' the rotten fens  Whose loves I priz'd as the dead carcase of  Unburied men that did corrupt my air  At present I have the honour to know a few select friends good and capable to serve myself and family and to make us happy and that is a consolation  every one  cannot boastAnd every reflective mind should observe that acrimonious and corrosive dispositions are such that having in themselves no share in Nature's bounties consequently they feel no pity towards such as have them  On the Monday at York though my illness was very little abated in spite of abuse and in spite of prudence having naturally at times a touch of the headstrong I persisted in being announced for Major Sturgeon on the Tuesday May Several persons called at Mr Baker's desiring me not to play for I should certainly be insulted urging also that my state of health made it wrong to attempt it However on that said appointed Tuesday I presented myself in Major Sturgeon when on my entrance the wrongs the audience had sustained as they termed it by their patience and forbearance the year before and such insolence added to drunkenness none but such good tempers would have permitted therefore an universal hiss with two or three  un  civil oranges burst at once on my devoted head I was superior to making an apology or offering an explanation when so unjustifiably and cruelly treated So I marched and countermarched as the Major though scarcely able to bear the weight of my boots and was hissed throughout that act and  at my exit received every mark of disgraceWhat I got for my labour the next day was that I need not think of playing Major Sturgeon after Mr Achurch as he performed it so much better and they wondered as I acted at York again I did not ask pardon for my insults to that public  It is no more strange than true though all this vexed and truly mortified me yet it roused my spirits in part from that languor my bad state of health had thrown me into as I really did not expect I should have remained long in this world but soon shut out daylight  The Spring Meeting was for the second trial that year on May the th th th and thI acted on Saturday the th Bajazet and the Orators for Old Tenoe's benefit Very little approbation nor many marks of the contrarytheir stony hearts began to relent and soften and my love of acting though il  l was very different to my present feelings for I am now truly grown weary and old with service though more weary than old and incapableI was so weak at that time that at the end of each play I fainted repeatedly from sickness and lack of strength yet would not give it up but kept acting away  In the May Meeting I performed Oakley and the Apprentice which in Dublin had pleased so much but I was unfortunately at York much  disapprovedI was shocking after Frodsham in Dick  May Kitely and Cadwallader in the AuthorThat night I was received into favourSeveral gentlemen desired I would play the Major once more and they would support me in itI was well received as the Major  May The Author was repeated and I seemed restored to their graceIf applause was to fix opinion on that matter  My Major Sturgeon gained such ground the second time May and so contrary from my first night's impression that the late Colonel Thornton then commander of the York militia bespoke my play but particularly desired the Mayor of Garratt The Colonel requested I would pass an hour with him on that occasion over a bottle at Howard's now Ringrose's a few days before my benefit and the York reader will allow me to be weak in body as I could not crawl so far without a chair though in the month of May on a fine day and the distance a few yards only  On Tuesday was my benefit by desire of Col ThorntonThe Funeral with the Mayor of Garratt cand I was contrary to my expectations favoured with great boxes and a very genteel house though not crammed as the year bebefore  the receipt was l I parted with respect and was on a much better footing with the public on my departure than the year before when I left York after a more superabundant benefit The vicissitudes of life are strange and sometimes misfortunes past are stories of delight  While at York I received a letter from Mrs Bellamy congratulating me on my good fortune in not going with the company to Glasgow for after the first night of performance the methodists had burst in and wilfully set fire to the theatre which conflagration had consumed every part of the stage with all her wardrobe and wearing apparel except what was on her back and that the wardrobe of the theatre had sustained the same fate I was so far consoled by the accident finding myself two hundred and forty miles nearer London than I should have been at Glasgow as to return thanks for my lucky escape and rejoiced to find though I was at York and had got into the fryingpan I had jumped away from the fireThese are Mrs Bellamy's words  "The next day at noon we saw the delightful  y to which we were going at a little distance before us The magnificence of the buildings and the beauty of the river which the fineness of the day caused to appear if possible  to greater advantage elated my heart and I anticipated the pleasure I should have in being received by friends who were not only most cordial in their repeated invitations but whose opulence furnished them with power to fulfil their warm promises of support"  "When we arrived at Glasgow one of the performers exclaimed  "Madam you are ruined for you have nothing left but what you have with you in the chaises"  I am at loss even now to account for the composure with which I heard this alarming salutation I was informed that the stage of the new theatre had been set on fire the night before and that all my paraphernalia and wardrobe which lay there unpacked had been consumed by the flames"  "The conflagration I found was occasioned by the following circumstance A methodist teacher who held forth in that city told his auditors that he dreamed the preceding night of being in the infernal regions at a grand entertainment where all the devils in hell were present when Lucifer their chief gave for a toast  "The health of Mr who had sold his ground to build him a house upon meaning the theatre and which was to be opened the next day for them all to reign in"    "The poor ignorant enthusiastic hearers of this  godly  preacher found their enmity against Satan and his subjects instantly inflamed by this harrangue and in order to prevent so alarming an extention of his infernal majesty's empire they hastened away in a body to the newbuilt playhouse and set the stage on fire Luckily the flames were extinguished before any other part of the theatre was consumed but the whole of my theatrical wardrobe which lay in the packages upon it were destroyed It appeared that this religious mob had been joined by others who wished to take advantage of the conflagration as a great deal of the false trumpery upon the regalia of the mock kings and queens had been taken away and being found of no great value lay scattered about the fields As the theatre was a mile from the city and the flames did not burst out so as to become visible the incendiaries completed their design and silently retired No alarm was therefore given nor our loss known till the next morning"  I left York but instead of attending to my health and proceeding as I ought to have done to London I took as good a roundabout way to the south as possible by crossing to the west I by slow stages set off for Manchester where the fatigue of two days and a half in getting thither  had overpowered me so much that instead of sleep I passed the night in agonies I however crawled into the coach that went to Warrington in the morning and from thence took postchaise to Frodsham a village in Cheshire where Frodsham the York actor was born and from thence got once more to Dan Smith's at ChesterWhitley's company was there and that manager invited me to play four nights and to give me the fifth I could not resist the temptation and began with no less a difficult character than Richard the Third the very rehearsal of which occasioned my repeatedly fainting However I armed myself with no less than a bottle of Madeira and went through beyond expectation at night I acted Shylock c but never got to bed after playing without one or more fainting fits Mr Wilbraham intreated I would desist but I urged as I had gone through so much gratis I would finish at all hazards though I knew my life was at stakeMr Didier a comedian now fixed at Bath was then at Chestera friendly agreeable gentleman  On Friday the d of June I finished with my benefit and acted Othello and Cadwallader in the Author and after all the wilful dangerous labour I underwent the receipt of the house was only lAll my acquaintance said I was rightly served being in a state so very unfit  for such an undertaking I there received a letter from Mr Foote who was astonished I neglected the Haymarket and the season so far advanced not informing him my reasons for not being in London at the expected season and more surprised to hear by accident that I was well he supposed as the Chester paper had given him a clue to find where I was I then informed him I would in a few days be with him but feared I could neither assist him nor myself by appearing on the stage I was so very incapable from severe sickness In two or three days following I took a place at Chester in a coach that at that time went through BirminghamI bid adieu to Mr Smith and Mr Wilberham neither of whom I ever expected to see again instead of that they are gone long since to rest and I am still in this world living to relate their deathsBut to keep up one's spirits and hope for the best is not a bad prescription in sickness or in health and it is to my astonishment with grateful acknowledgments to Almighty God for his blessings that here I am in tolerable health not yet having swallowed the allotment of dust to which I am to return  In the coach were seated Madame Capdeville a principal dancer with her mother the daughter had been for years a first dancer at Covent Garden theatre but then returning from Ireland  I was very much indisposed and discomposed with the journey but both my fellow travellers were very kind and attentive to me At broad noonday the ladies desired the coachman to stop and having the door opened out they went in full display and with the most perfect composure performed a deed without a name in the middle of the road but as it was summer and dusty the roads wanted watering The John Bull of a coachman blushed and hung down his head and ill as I was I could not refrain from the oddity of the whole groupe being considered as viewing and not viewing the whimsical transactionI need not add those females were French not English ladies When the coach towards evening stopped at Castle Bromage I thought while the ladies were drinking tea I would attempt to walk a mile and let the coach overtake me and in case of being enfeebled as the evening was serene could stop at some stile or door till I could be relieved by the attending vehicle I dragged myself on for near a mile or perhaps more when I halted expecting succour from the arrival of the carriage every minute then endeavoured slowly to proceed for fear of growing chilly then I waited then I walked and that disagreeable predicament I sustained till all my patience was turned to the contrary extreme and tottering like  Jane Shore in the last act was reduced to rea  pain and uneasiness It was some time before on the road I could meet a friendly cottage to give me information or a comfortable restingplace for by the quick approach of night my anxiety greatly increased the first hut I saw I implored a hearing and related my dismal story of waiting for the coach c and on reciting my ditty and explaining my distressed situation the good old woman of the cottage exclaimed  "O good Sir you are sadly beside your own sen for you are now on London coach road coach is right weel at Brumugum ere this so you mun cross country like you look perilous bad lse sure and God send you well at Brumugum"  I then inquired with aching heart how far Birmingham was from thence She said  "Why a mun not mair than three or four miles  like  only cross country  like  "  Now three or four computed miles by such guessers generally turns out double the ground they mention and to the stranger is trebleHe is perplexed at every turning by not knowing whether he is right or wrong and that was my situation besides my sufferings from pain when I attempted to undertake to walk and explore my way to Birminghamand this situation so horrid was all occasioned by my having committed a blunder a child would have been  whipped for the want of common observation at the division of the road and the remedy very easy for with patience and money in my purse the first countryman for a shilling or so would have gone to the Welch Harp at Castle Bromage and ordered a postchaise and besides my illness all my luggage was in the coach with cash clothes c which without resting a night proceeded directly for LondonHowever in spite of prudence or ability I determined on this walk to Birmingham with all my imperfections on my head While the night was making quick approach to darkness off I set and crossed from place to place sometimes with intelligence then not any to be had I had boots on and when I had conquered three or four miles to add still to my misfortune and misery my kneebuckle got loose dropped down my boot and imperceptibly worked itself to the bottom and at last got under the sole of my foot which occasioned not only uneasiness but very excruciating pain to a degree not to be endured and no possibility of relieving my anguish and it frequently shifted in the walking which caused increasing and variety of torments I actually should have abandoned myself to despair and to the first dry ditch for my night's lodging which then must have finished me but fortunately casting up my eyes through the  gloomy dusk I with a most pleasing sensation beheld the steeple of the new church at Birmingham which I recollected with rapture it gave a faint gleam of hope and like a drowning man and the straw so did I in idea feed my hopes with the luxury of a featherbed and a negus by twelve o'clockI was however as may naturally be supposed much farther off my station than I imaginedbut while there is life there are hopes I could never have accomplished that event had not the perspiration I underwent been so undescribably violent that I dared not stop a moment to suffer the winds of heaven to visit my face too roughly and at the same time though overpowered with weakness I felt myself breathe easier and the fever and hectic heat not so strong as it usually hung upon me By twelve o'clock thank God I accomplished my surprising undertaking which had given me more pain anxiety trouble and danger than ever the famous Powell encountered on his walks from London to York and back again I soon after my arrival at Mr Barber's the Swan got a strong Madeira negus and on inquiring was much pleased and obliged to Madame Capdeville who had kindly taken care to have all my luggage left safely under the protection of Mr Barber for her head aided by the observation of the coachman had suggested  how my unfortunate blunder had happened which prevented my having much trouble and inquiries What had helped the matter was my having been a constant friend to Mr Barber the season I have beforementioned being at Birmingham under the command of my friend Mr Hull in  I was weak the next day and could not get out of bed but no fever and the perspiration still continued immoderately After three or four days I found myself recovering and wishing to be in London whether to live or die I ordered a postchaise and in two days and a half got there without being too much hurried and received benefit by making the stages easy and suitable as I  ound my spirits I went to my own apart  ents and there got under good direction and  or once in my life kept regular hours used moderate exercise and in a short time was so surprisingly improved in health as to wish being again on the boards and produced my skeleton figure to Mr Foote he was astonished and expressed himself much hurt at seeing me so ill but seemed impatient for me to begin at his theatreSettling terms took but little timehe was not mean but acted generously I was not unreasonable for what I asked he immediately grantedIndeed my terms might be better as I pleaded apparent ill health and  not  wishing to play  The old dish of the Minor was in July appointed for my first onset which Mr Foote had not acted but had deferred in the interim wondering at my delayand the Minor not having been acted at either theatre from September till that time gave it a degree of novelty I was received that year as an old established favourite of the town The Haymarket stage was as easy as the York stage was when I had the use of my legs and where I might be said of late years to have been truly at home  Tragedy AlaMode was revived for Mr Foote and myself to appear in Mr Project Mr Foote the tragedy part all by me and was often repeated with equal and uncommon applause I increased highly in public favour not only from the indulgent partiality of the audience which in general accompanies such performers as they honour with their good and golden opinion but I was then particularly industrious and acting was my only resource for pleasureMy severe illness had alarmed me so much that I lived strictly regular I was more collected a material article for young or old actors to observe and follow for though a man be used to wine and good dinners and be perfectly clear and sober in his room yet the least flurry or mistake on the stage sets that dinner and wine into a fume and makes the brain feel deranged  and confused and no actor can be a good timeist on the stage unless he keeps himself cool and collected and in good spirits of the purest kind not beholden to the assistance of the grape  "O thou invincible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee  Devil  To be now a sensible man and by and by a fool and presently a beastEvery inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil"  The true refreshment of the performer should be from the fanning gales excited from the pleasure of the audience while the actor in return feels his heart glowing with rapture and gratitude  My health improved daily and by acting with Mr Foote I had seldom more stage exercise than what was of service to me The Apprentice was also revived which I acted very often to a crowded theatreIt was commanded by the Duke of York as a first piece which occasioned the only little dispute that in the Haymarket theatre ever occurred between Mr Foote and myself His Royal Highness commanded it as a first piece as he urged some very particular engagementMr Foote appointed the Minor as the after piece and I remonstrated and indeed re  used playing Shift enforcing that as a  l my imitat  ons were so dispersed in the Apprentice I could not leave out in the character of Shift what I had  accustomed the audience to see and if I did perform the same the repetition of such mimicry instead of being pleasing would be offensive Mr Foote seemed much displeased and even disgusted but yielded to my argument and on that occasion played Shift himself there was no more dispute about it or was it ever mentioned again  We had one little sparringbout in the spring of which Mr Woodward soon reconciled I had acted by having secretly obtained a purloined copy his farce of the Devil upon Two Sticks and after having committed the fault and well knowing he would quickly hear of my offence I by way of preventing his anger informed him of my invasion on his property thinking he would construe it as a very good joke but on the contrary he was really much irritated and by return of post favoured me with the few following whimsical lines  MY DEAR SIR  YOUR favour brought me the first account of the Devil upon Two Sticks having been played upon your stageYour letter has delivered me from every difficulty and will procure me the pleasure of soon seeing you in town as I shall most certainly move the Court of  King's Bench against you the first day of next term I have the honour to be my dear Sir  your most obliged and faithful humble servant SAM FOOTE  May  Mr Foote's sly indignation insinuated in the above obliged me to have recourse to my friend Woodward's interference which in a little time after procured me the following with the olivebranch from the Devil upon Two Sticks and as they are both originals imagine they will be deemed worth perusal  DEAR SIR  METHINKS I hear you say to Mrs Wilkinson  "Do not you think Mr Woodward considering all our civility is a little negligent in his return"  What signified writing till I had materials to write uponI waited for an opportunity to see and converse with Foote in a proper momenthave eat with him  drank  with him took him in a  convivial cue  and after all can assure you there is nothing will happen from that quarter unless fresh crimes are committed I saw Macklin the other night who tells me he has travelled lately to Leicester and intends writing to you I suppose upon the subject that  induced him to travelI shall send the nonsense I promised you the very first opportunityI expected Mr Tasker to dine with me at my little mansion out of town but I have seen him but once and that accidentally in the street since we parted at StiltonThe weather has been much against us at the Haymarket and we have done nothing yet to swagger aboutWhen I have been alone in the fields near my dwellingplace I have sometimes thought of you and your theatreI have conceived and perhaps may bring forth an  Harlequin at York races  if I am delivered of a wellfeatured kinchin I will pin it up in a basket and drop it at your doorwithout any offence to Mrs Wilkinsonto whom pray give my most grateful compliments and accept the same yourself from him who really is  your sincere friend and humble servant H WOODWARD  June  Mr Foote and I after that time were on th  most perfect terms of intimacy as the followin  will evidence amongst a number I have now b  me from that gentleman and man of true wi  humour and genius  DEAR SIR  I AM much obliged to you for the offer of your assistance in the town of Newcastle but the newspapers have laid out a plan for me that never occurred to myself  Your old friend De has not only lost his situation with me and Colman but is on the brink of losing his nose so that his head and his tail have brought him into a pretty condition  I hope the northern crown sits lightly on your brow and that your immediate subjects are not only dutiful and observant but that your whole wideextended empire pay their taxes largely and cheerfully I have this summer entertained the veteran Sheridan who is dwindled to a mere co  k and bottle Chelsea pensionerHe has enlisted some new recruits unfit for service and such as might be expected to issue from his discipline  I should be glad to chop upon you in my way to Edinburgh for which place I shall set out about the middle of October  Ross is with me ill and indolent but however thanks to my own industry the campaig  has been happy enough  Believe me most sincerely yours SAM FOOTE  NorthEnd  Aug  In to my part of the Apprentice in London when acted as the afterpiece I was ever honoured with the continuance of the audience on account of the four last lines to which I never had less than four plaudits for my imitations were not only good but well planned for effectand much depends on that One speech in a parody of different writing would suit for the mimicry of one particular person which to imitate another would seem all discordant and out of time and placeThe last lines to the Apprentice were as follows to which are affixed the names for those who knew the actors of those days to judge how far they were applicable or the contrary  Sparks  Some act the upper some the under parts  Sheridan  And most assume what's foreign to their hearts  Mossop  Thus life is but a tragic comic  jest  Woodward  And all is farce and mummery at best  The regular marking each actor's features and manners in those lines gave great effect and obtained much approbation  Mr Weston was of great assistance in that farce by his inimitable acting of Simon  I requested Mrs Rich on my benefit to honour me once more with letting me ride her hobbyhorses and give them a summer's airing as they had not been rubbed down for a twelvemonth  which she kindly granted me and I acted Bayes by universal desire and to a house much more crowded than the year beforeThat truly excellent actor Mr Parsons was then at Mr Foote's theatre and I think will remember my assertion to be not a chimera of the brain but a fact  From a love of cash I performed five Saturdays for the sixth to be clear at the old theatre on Richmond Hill Mr Foote lent me his dresses and my benefit was on Saturday August and was honoured with the sanction of the Duke of York Lady Petersham and a large party were there and I was favoured with a brilliant appearance Most of the little pit was laid into the boxes The farce of the Citizen I had as a play and I acted Young Philpot Old Philpot Mr Weston with Tragedy AlaMode  Mr Foote's season ended the middle of SeptemberI sold all my furniture china c which was very good though not of the newest fashion being that of my honoured father's and mother's originally at the old Savoy residence but as I had lost my revered good parent I had not any occasion for constant apartments being kept in London at Mr Alcock's who is a most worthy man and enjoying ease and affluence from the sweet gathered fruits of industry That business  of sale being concluded I set off for Liverpool where I wa  an entire stranger but had heard money not grass grew in the streets There I offered my Tea to sale but they were better judges of traffic than to purchase from one they thought no better of than a hawker or a pedler and I no more than a destitute pedler at that time who had a licence to distribute my wares the inhabitants of Liverpool prov  d to me cautious and wary I hired what was called the BucksRoom and there I expected a numerous attendance from curiosity but truth compels me to relate l was the first night's receipt October the th and the other on October the th l and they were attended so ill that my own cash not that of the Liverpool bank secured me a carriage to Birmingham where I cannot boast of superior attraction the best receipt being only l From thence I returned from the southward to old West Chester and at that ancient city had an elegant and crowded appearanceVery strange that when I relied on myself alone I was well attended by my Chester friends as before observed From that place I went to Bristol where I had a brilliant room there I received a letter of invitation forwarded to me from Mr Jefferson  On November I performed for my friend Mr Fleming's benefit at Bath who had  he week preceding favoured me with his assistance on my night at the Bristol assemblyrooms  Early in December I set off for Exeter where Mr Jefferson my old friend and acquaintance in Dublin and London was then become the manager and every thing promised most flatteringly that he would soon make a fortune But the substance is often changed for a shadow nor are managers' gains so easily amassed as the public can gather it for them His invitation had double allurementfirst  novelty  which was ever prevalent and next to see so pleasant and friendly a man as he had ever proved to meI joined him and his new troopMr Jefferson was at that time endeavouring not without encouragement to bring that theatre into a regular and established reputationHe had engaged Mr Reddish and many other good performers Mrs Jefferson his first wife was then living she had one of the best dispositions that ever harboured in a human breast and more extraordinary joined to that meekness she was one of the most elegant women ever beheld The city of Exeter had till that time for some years been under the management in theatrical matters of the old Portsmouth and Plymouth company of comedians of whom I have made so much mention from the year  but all that set by the practice of  morning  drams from alehouse to alehouse besides every hour being employed in large libations with their friends as they termed them had as by universal agreement one would suppose almost all of them made their final exit to another world  Unanointed unaneal'd no reck'ning made  But sent to their account  With all their imperfections on their heads  Which should be here marked to the general class of actors as a lighthouse to mariners in bad weather to all morning stage  drinking  town or country performers as a slow but sure poison a dangerous custom easily attained but once admitted as a habit very very difficult to quit and the conclusion certain ruin  With sense and reason holds superior strife  And conquers honour nature fame and life  It will be here scornfully and perhaps too justly remarked by unforgiving zealots what strange dissipated creatures low players are but let them recollect that every profession has its degrees and singularities and I think it as strange a trait when I observe a proud priest beyond a Wolsey bursting with Mossopian pride and will certainly smile when informed he has been holding forth on meekness  of spirit and charity to all menNor should a preacher's changing his opinion after having been a constant attendant at the theatre and a professed admirer of the drama warp my judgment because he from  lucrative visws  has altered his way of thinking as we all do at different periods according to our state of health our humour or our time of life When I picture pretenders meeting under the cloak of outside purity I marvel  like Lady Brumpton  how one can accost the other with a grave face Methinks they  hould laugh out like two fortunetellers or two opponent lawyers that know each other for cheats The great and good in all ages have been protectors of the Muses and they will outbalance any characters that can be set in opposition And I must beg permission to advance that no diversion ever was devised which is so truly calculated to instruct while it entertains and it is no argument against the stage to affirm that the morals of some of its professors have been tainted by it for the evil and perverse inclination will extract malignity from a Howard a Hanway or a Mason Let us ask the most rigidDid never the man of intrigue first become acquainted at  church  with her whose unsuspecting innocence he has sacrificed  o his passionsBid me not drink because Alexander was  poisoned  nor suffer any fire in my  house because London was  burned  the reasons in defence of these remonstrances would be of the same force against the theatre  "O but" says one of the sanctified "a young lady dropped down dead some years ago in the Hull theatrePoor thing the Devil found her on his own ground"  And pray Mr Good Man  Pure  name any place where Mr Death ever did or does pay any ceremony  The dreadful earthquake at Lisbon which happened at the time of high mass was on a Sunday noonone half of the lives lost on that occasion were at their duty though taken unprepared to that undiscovered country that puzzles our will  Besides the whole body of actors should not be condemned because a few are unconvertible since by the same rule we may freely abuse the state the clergy the army and every set of people until one offers itself to our view which has never been disgraced by a memberThis I believe is not in being  To have filled the theatre had it been possible with professed methodists  the drama's declared enemies  they would have involuntarily wept at Mr Garrick's Lear and have laughed incessantly at his Abel Drugger The strict sects who are  blessed with superiority of virtue should make allowances from their own superfluity of goodness for the thoughtless sallies of men of genius and quick passions who are too liable to fall into mistakes many inconsiderate minds have been too easily led into error and have thereby forfeited their country friends and liberty and by the necessary laws have been subject to the most ignominious as well as heartfelt sufferings yet after reflection aided by judgment and selfcorrection and full conviction of their folly have providentially been blessed with affluence and prosperitySo the poor player who struts his life upon the stage is too often drove thereto from acts of indiscretion and seeks refuge in the theatre as his  derni  r  resortIf unsuccessful he turns again abandoned and from intoxication becomes indifferent as to what he does either in regard to his life his death or his reputationbut if blessed with genius and the seeds of industry and attention and also happily fostered and nourished by the good and affluent his mind expands and the child of folly on the stage becomes in reality  new born  proves a shining ornament to the theatre and an example wo  thy of imitation to his newlyadopted profession consequently a praiseworthy character and a credit to universal society  An honest man's the noblest work of God  At the time of my expedition to Exeter there existed at that place a most eccentric genius and very particular character Mr Andrew Brice a printerHe was to a degree remarkable in manner figure and a thousand peculiarities that cannot be described but had accumulated by art genius and lucky circumstances an independent fortuneGeorge Faulkener of Dublin was by no means such an extraordinary being besides Mr Faulkener as a man of benevolent and good qualities must ever be revered but in the comparison of goodness the rueful Andrew Brice should not be mentionedAlluding to Andrew Brice gives me authority from Mr King himself to insert the following  When Mr Garrick wrote the character of Lord Ogleby it was before he went to Italy but on his return and once more engaging with the fatigues of his theatre he relinquished all thoughts of acting that part telling Mr King for his reasons that he found his state of health not equal to sustain the run of a new play and that if he himself should play Lord Ogleby it would lead into applications from authors to request his performing in their pieces to prevent which he had come to a determination not to study any new character whatever and desired Mr King would do the partMr King begged to declineMr  Garrick read it to that gentlemanThe part he still refused even to the fourth time and desired the part of Brush instead of Lord OglebyMr Garrick still continued pressing and Mr King fearing Mr Garrick should think him more obstinate than right took the part to consider of it and by paying close attention when locked up in his study he accidentally repeated a few passages in a tremulous voice which recurred to his ear as something similar to the sound of old Andrew Brice's of ExeterHe tried again and again and found he had hit upon the very man as a natural and true picture to represent Lord Ogleby Mr King went to Mr Garrick and privately rehearsed a sceneGarrick was all astonished and thundered out  "By Gd King if you can but sustain that fictitious manner and voice throughout it will be one of the greatest performances that ever adorned a British theatre"  Mr Garrick's prophecy was verified as Mr King's manner of producing that character before the public was then and is to this day one of the most capital and highlyfinished pieces of acting with which any audience ever was treated and will never be forgotten while a trait of Mr King can be remembered But alas the actor's fame however great cannot be recollected many years beyond  the time he lived for ah me as Garrick observed  The painter dead yet still he charms the eye  While England lives his fame can never die  But he  who struts  his hour upon the stage  Can scarce extend his fame for half an age  Nor pen nor pencil can the actor save  The art and artist share one common grave  Andrew Brice in figure and tremulous manner was exactly what Mr King appears to be in Lord Ogleby and I could have forgiven Brice had he painted like his Lordship for he had so much of the lily in his complexion that he looked tho' one of the neatest the most corpselike Mandarine figure I ever beheld in the various productions of Human Nature  When I acted Bayes at Exeter and spoke a speech or two in his manner it struck the whole audience like electricityMr Jefferson who performed Johnson was so taken by the surprise that  e could not proceed for laughterHe is now at Exeter and will I am certain recollect and corroborate that circumstance My benefit even at this distant time demands my acknowledgement it was so numerously attended I ever think of Exeter with pleasure the country that surrounds that city is beautiful and the air esteemed more  screne and salubrious than almost any other part of the kingdomAs a proof it is judged so I have known families who have been in bad health ordered by Yorkshire physicians to winter the severe months at Exeter as the  Montpelier  of Great BritainGood eating abounds there and the market produces an uncommon variety of articles all in the highest perfectionI was there in the winter and in January the face of the country looked well and produced a verdure not usual at that inclement season in other parts of England I went from thence for two days with Mr Jefferson to Plymouth at the dock I met my old acquaintance Captain Scot of Chesterthe situation seemed striking but I had not leisure nor was it a time of the year to judge of the prospect of Mount Edgcumbe c to any fair advantageI took a peep at the theatre though on a Sunday it appeared very decent Good theatres were not  then  so plenty in any county as at present the flat scenes I remember moved on a principle I never saw either before or since they pushed up and down a groove in one straight frame like  windowsash which must be a good plan a  hey so worked must be always steady and the canvas not wrinkled as when on rollersOne inconvenience must attend ita great height in the building is required and another they must always  gather dust and dirt which will consequently efface the paintingOne good effect however occurs no idler performer or other could move the scene and produce the head of Peeping Tom while an act was conducting of the utmost consequence A trifling accident of that kind  once  disconcerted me muchthe audience hissed the person so peeping which disgrace I took to myself but had it soon pleasingly explainedThat fault should be more avoided by the performers than it is  Before I finished at Exeter I had the most presing invitations repeatedly from Mess Dowson and Bates at Edinburgh intimating they could not go on without my immediate assistanceA pretty little trip the end of January from Exeter to EdinburghHowever preliminaries were soon settled and Mr Jefferson had behaved friendly generously politely and attentively I left him with my best wishes and proceeded to London where I rested only two or three days and then posted down for the north stopped one day with Mr Baker at York saw the new theatrebroke down near Durhamt  chaise was so shattered with the crush I was obliged to wait on the road till another could be procured I myself was asleep and not hurt though I confess a little alarmed Mr Dowson was purposely come to Newcastle to treat me from thence post to Edinburgh we only continued one  day We got safe to the capital of ScotlandThe first night on the road thither we lay at Old Camus which house I believe is now erasedfrom what cause I know notit was said to be haunted and though I am not superstitious as to such idle dreams and fictions of the brain yet I must declare such a noise I never heard in my life as during the night at that place We reached Edinburgh the first week in February The theatre had sustained the loss of Mr Digges and Mrs Bellamy the only true support was Mr Aickin There was it is true a Mr Stamper who had been a great favourite but he was grown quite inebriated and that from  morning  drinking The company was much the same except Mr Stamper Mr Creswick a Mr Parker and Mrs Pye from Ireland also Mr and Mrs M'George We went on tolerably till Richard the Third was acteda character at Edinburgh I was always particularly well received in and with more than common applause but during the summer sessions in Mr Sheridan had engaged for a certain number of nights and on one of those nights had acted Richard at which time the want of a young gentleman or lady to supply the part of Prince Edward rendered it impracticable to have the play acted unless Mrs Mozeen whose figure was neat and youthful though bordering at that time on  the vale of years would quit petticoat hopes in Lady Anne of royal coronation and assume the young monarch in expectation of the same honours But in the winter Mrs Wheeler's daughters who promised remarkably well on the stage supplied the childrens' parts very ably Mrs Mozeen expected her Lady Anne as her  ock part and no supposition could be wellgrounded for Mrs M'George's taking offence at it for though she had played Lady Anne with Mr Sheridan in the summer season she must have known it was necessity and goodnature in Mrs Mozeen to have resigned Lady Anne for Prince Edward on a matter of emergency which obstacle being removed and the children provided for the royal stock she had double claim to former rights But on the night Richard was acted in the scene where Mrs Mozeen in Lady Anne made her appearance a general uproar ensued aye even to the pelting of the lady the collegians one and all having formed a severe party at the malevolent misrepresentations instigated by Mr and Mrs M'George whose wrongs were related with double force to the town as being cruelly deprived o  Lady Anne a character in which she had been received with so much praiseworthy applauseMrs M'George in  ended to have produced another Lady Anne to the wondering audience to la  ent  a husband but Manager Dowson having been alarmed by authenticated intelligence that mischief was brewing barricaded the entrances and kept them double guarded by doorkeepers to prevent Roxana with her dagger from gaining admittance behind the scenes and thereby wounding the bosom of his beloved Statira It was an hour before the uproar ceased but Mrs Mozeen evinced if she had a little body she had a great soul  The audience were very attentive and honoured me much that evening in every scene except where Lady Anne made her appearance and then marks of rage indignation and contempt ensuedThe riot did not subside with that night but lasted above a fortnight and was carried to such extremes that not any ladies visited the theatre from apprehension of disturbances and outrage Manager Dowson who paid adoration to his beloved Statira even equal to the poet's fancy levelled all his fury on her desperate foe Mrs M'George by an immediate dismission which stroke of sudden impolicy at that juncture only served to enrage the more Dowson still faithful to his faithless mistress rather than Mrs M'George's party should have reigned triumphant I verily believe would have taken a torch at noon and set our famed Persepolis on fire but the Fates did what the manager could not for though the collegians gave  ammunition and all manual assistance in Mrs M'George's defence yet they did not or could not afford to offer their purses therefore as provisions grew scanty that tragic queen thought it more prudent and better generalship to retreat than be starved by attacking a fortress she found determined on obstinate defence and which perseverance stood very little chance of subduing nor would she trust to the chance of war which seemed to threaten instant famine and though she had proved her ability to raise discord she plainly found she could not in her distressed state raise the necessary supplies for if Dowson could not pay his regiment with notes from the bank of Air he could find remaining resources and draw from Newcastle but the M'George's forces tho' few from desertions had to their surprise only the bank of  air  to rely on so off she and her spouse went and soon after her departure the cause of dispute being removed Time's lenient hand spread over mutual faults our theatrical wounds were healed and peace and harmony once more restored us to our pristine health and vigourThis is no more in the relation of our stage battle at Edinburgh than a strict matter of fact and can be attested by a gentleman of wellknown worth and veracity Mr Garenciers now of York who was at that time a student at Edinburgh college  Treating on the subject of rio  s occasions my proceeding with a few anecdotes  I remember in the winter of that  that  was the season Mrs Cibber was first attacked with her s  omach complaint and Barry the divine Barry either had or pretended he had frequent sore throats and hoarsenesses The comedies in which Mrs Woffington was principal were generally brought forward on these sicknesses of the tragedians and at the bottom of the bill in which she alone stood capital were generally announced the united names of Quin Barry and Cibber of this she constantly complained and at last declared that the next time it happened she would not playShortly after Jane Shore was announced Mrs Cibber was ill and the play changed late in the day but I cannot say to whatThe next day the Constant Couple was put up Sir Harry Wildair Mrs Woffington with the great names at the bottom of the billWoffington kept her word sent a message at five o'clock she was ill and positively refused to playthey were obliged to substitute the Miser Lovegold Mr Macklin By this time the public began to murmur at their frequent disappointments and took it into their heads that Mr Rich the manager was very ill used by his company and determined on the next  indisposition  they would interfere and resent for  him Precisely at this time Woffington made her refusal and on her next appearance in Lady Jane Grey the whole weight of their resentment fell on herwhoever is living and saw her that night will own they never beheld any figure half so beautiful sinceher anger gave a glow to her complexion and even added lustre to her charming eyes they treated her very rudely bade her ask pardon and threw orange peels She behaved with great resolution and treated their rudeness with glorious contempt she left the stage was called for and with infinite persuasion was prevailed on to return However she did walked forward and told them she was there ready and willing to perform her character if they chose to permit her that the decision was  theirs on  or  off  just as they pleased a matter of indifference to herThe  ons  had it and all went smoothly afterwards though she always persisted in believing that the party was originally formed by Mr Rich's family and particular friends some of whom she did not scruple to name though I believe she always acquitted him of any knowledge of it  It is often mentioned in the country that a manager should prevent every riotthat a manager should be ready to answer on any frivolous occasionwere that to be really submitted to how could Mr Garrick dared to have had a palace at  Hampton Court for his chief residence or Mr Harris live at Knightsbridge constantly or be part of the season at Bath entrusting the care of the theatre and answers to the public in case of unforeseen particular disturbances to Mr Kemble Mr Lewis or the principal actor then on the spot if danger or misfortune threatenedThese suppositions in the country leads to incendiary epistles But how can such daemons pretended friends or secret enemies be answered either as to their illwill or affected good wishes equally immaterial and not availing as be the contents right or wrong true or false good or bad it would be ridiculous and really loss of time to answer what is avowedly fabricated by  nobody  I had in consequence thereof formed a resolution in future never to read any one of the kind and had in fact carried the resolve into practice but accident only broke the determination for one morning last York races on opening a letter and not perceiving any name I threw it on the table which Mrs W perused and hastily declared I had an estate le  t me I instantly took up Mr Anonymous and read the following lines  Petworth in Sussex  SIR  BY the death of a Mr Whicker you are supposed to have right to considerable property  and desired to send your mother's maiden name respectively to the executorsMr Ireland here and Mr Wait of Byworth near Petworth  Aug  I on inquiry was soon informed by a most respectable family in Essex that the executors had been from such letters greatly plagued and tormented by different applications and that one person had actually travelled some hundred miles with great fatigue trouble perplexity and expence to attain the Sussex estate but was soon after his arrival convinced it was all a bubble
