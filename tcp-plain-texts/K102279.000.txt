 THE CONTRACT A COMEDY OF TWO ACTS AS IT WAS PERFORMED AT THE Theatre Royal in the HayMarket  LONDON  Printed for the AUTHOR by J MILLIDGE And sold by T DAVIES in RusselStreet CoventGarden T CADELL and T EVANS in the Strand MDCCLXXVI PRICE ONE SHILLING  PROLOGUE  Intended to have been Spoken by Mr FOOTE  THE Contract is it call'dI cannot say  I much admire the title of his play  Contracts they tell me have been fraught with evil  Since  Faustus  sign'd his Contract withthe  Devil  Yet spite of  Satan  all men love to make 'em  Tho' nineteen out of twenty wish to break 'em  Butchers and mealmen brewers agents factors  Pimps poets placemen managers and actors  Bawds bankrupts booksellers are allContractors  All lye and swear and cheat t' increase their store  Then die and gowhere  Faustus  went before  Whilst thus o'er all we see th' infection spread  No wonder it shou'd taint the marriage bed  Each wife forgets each husband breaks his vow  For what are Contracts what is wedlock now  Garrick  who long was marry'dto the town  At length a fashionable husband grown  Forsakes his spouse base man for truth to tell  She lov'd her own dear  Davy  wond'rous well  Tho' now he slights her breaks from her by force  And nought will serve him but a full divorce  But be the fault in women or in men  Thanks to our laws they all maywed again  Her faithless fav'rite gone the Lady's free  To choose another and may smileon me  To the  Lame Lover  may resign her charms  And tho' a cripple take me to her arms  I'll promise to be constant kind polite  And pay my dutyevery other night  My dearlov'd rib I never will abandon  But stand by her whilst I've  ONE  leg to stand on  I'll make a solemn  Contract  play or pay  And hope we shall not part this many a day  Our brother scribbler too I greatly fear  Has made a foolish kind of Contract here  He promises and ten to one you're bit  To furnish fable sentiment and wit  I've seen his piece the man appeal'd to me  And I as chancellor issued my decree  T'has pass'd the sealsthey're going to rehearse it  But you're the  House of Peers  and may reverse it  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Colonel Lovemore  an old Officer

ELEANOR  Never worse in my life Betty  BETTY  Lud Ma'am you frighten me  ELEANOR  Betty  BETTY  Ma'am  ELEANOR  In the bottom drawer of my walnuttree chest Betty there lies if the moths have not devoured it my  Practice of Piety  look for it good girl and bring it me hither  BETTY  Aside  Yes Madam Sure my mistress is in a bad way to think of such things  Exit  ELEANOR  Sighing  Well 'tis what we must all come to O Time Time what a cruel destroyer thou art  Pulls out a pocketglass  Where are all my roses fled all faded gone  Betty returns blowing the dust off the book  ELEANOR  Well Betty  BETTY  Here it is Ma'am but in  such  a picklebless me I believe your ladyship has not looked in it these ten years  ELEANOR  Give it me child Let me see somewhere towards the end on a blank leaf if I am not mistaken are the births of the family  turns over the leaves  O here it isEleanor daughter of Thomas and Sarah bornchristened July hundred and let me see and isO Lud Betty I am an old woman positively an old woman Heretake away the filthy memorandum and never let it see the light 'till  BETTY  'Till the birth of your first boy Ma'amFye fye Madam never mind such musty records but consult this better and more faithful monitor  Brings the lookingglass  ELEANOR  Looking at herself in the glass  Since what I was I cannot be  What I am I would not see  As the poet says O Betty how provoking it is that I should begin to grow old and ugly just at the time I want to be young and handsome  BETTY  Indeed Ma'am you wrong your charms in my opinion you have not look'd so well these five years  ELEANOR  Go go you're a wicked flatterer  BETTY  Indeed but I a'nt Ma'am Besides if you were a little older you'd be young enough yet I think for the Colonel Methinks Ma'am 'tis a thousand pities you two did not come together some fifteen or twenty years ago  ELEANOR  Why really Betty I wish we  had  but then matters did not suit You must know the Colonel was under the direction of an old surly guardian who wanted him to marry his niece and because he refused kept him out of  his fortune by law and chicanerywhilst I was teiz'd to death by an immortal old aunt who threatened to disinherit me if I married without her consentAbout five years ago I became my own mistress with some thousands in my pocket and then the Colonel was gone to the EastIndies  BETTY  There to be sure he was out of luck  ELEANOR  Since that however his advancement in the army with the estate left him by his uncle and the lawsuit with his guardian determined in his favour have made him a match for the best fortune in the kingdom at the age of  BETTY  Near sixtyI'll answer for it  ELEANOR  In short Betty whilst we were young we had nothing but love to bestow one another and  now  we have  BETTY  Every thing else I suppose  ELEANOR  Even so indeedBut the worst of the story is yet to come for do you know Betty such fools were  we  such absolute strangers to human nature as to vow everlasting fidelity to each other and to enter into  BETTY  No contract I hope  ELEANOR  The very thingTo enter into contract never to marry any body else under forfeiture of every thing we were possessed of in the world  BETTY  Well and you intend to perform it  ELEANORA  Never Betty What marry a wornout soldier of sixtyand turn nurseBesides these poor remains of beauty are not worth his acceptance  BETTY  And you have no other reason in natureno to be sureHa ha ha I find how it is then  ELEANOR  You do'nt suspect my constancy I hope do you know Mrs Betty I shall be very angry with you  BETTY  Indeed Madam you will  not  Come come I know  ELEANOR  Why what do you know Mrs Saucebox  BETTY  Why Madam I know you go much oftener of late than you us'd to Lady Mary's I know too that her nephewnay Madam you need not blushthe agreeable Capt Spritely is just returned from his travels and that he is one of the handsomest bestmade most agreeable young fellows in the whole county  ELEANOR  Betty hold your impertinent tonguehold your tongue this minute orDo you really think the Captain is so handsome  BETTY  Yes Madam and what's more I believe has no dislike to your ladyship  ELEANOR  Impossible however I will confess I have seen the Captain and am  BETTY  Most horribly in love with him  ELEANOR  No not thatbut what if he should  not  like  me  BETTY  Ridiculous let me see e'er a young adventurer in England without sixpence to his fortune refuse a woman of your sense and beauty with twenty thousand pounds  ELEANOR  But what must I do with the poor Colonel By the last letters I had from him he depends on marrying me the moment he returns the very house I am now in and the furniture belonging to it are  his  he requested me in the most tender manner to live in it 'till he came and to consider every thing that belonged to him as much  my  property as his own faithful heart what's to be done Betty  BETTY  Done Madam why turn him off at once and take the Captain Why there is no more nowadays in changing one's lover than in changing ones linen  ELEANOR  Aye but this plaguy contractsigned and sealed Betty  BETTY  Why that circumstance indeed is rather against us but time Madam time may reconcile all things  ELEANOR  True Betty but how to keep off the old lover and to bring on the  new  onethat  BETTY  Aye Madam  that  's the questionLet  me  seeO I have it If the mountain won't come to Mahomet why then Mahomet must come to the mountainthat  is  if  you  cannot go to the Captain why then the Captain must come to  you  ELEANOR  But how my dear Machiaveltell me but  how  BETTY  O leave that to  me  Suppose now suppose  ELEANOR  Well what  BETTY  Supposebut hush we're interrupted  Enter a Servant  SERVANT  Commodore Capstern Madam  ELEANOR  O heavensthat seamonsterthen I'll lay my life on't his old friend the Colonel is not far offnow will he overwhelm me with his forecastle jests on our approaching nuptials  For heaven's sake Betty throw out some tub to this old whale or he'll devour me Step down immediately my good girl and make some excuse for meSay I'm illI'm gone abroadany thing to get rid of himthis is the most impertinent interruption  BETTY  Well Ma'am I'll do what I can for you but I fear 'twill be to no purpose if I drive him to sea he'll swim ashore again in half an hour However I'll try  Betty goes out  ELEANOR  Alone  Well these chambermaids are certainly the most useful creatures in the universe there is not a greater genius for lying and intrigue within an hundred miles than this trusty Abigail of mineand yet after all I begin to have some qualms of conscience about my poor old ColonelBut Spritely is  so  handsome O love love what a vowbreaker art thou  Enter Betty  ELEANOR  Well Betty what newsis he off  BETTY  O yes Madam I dispatched him he said he'd call again presently but I told him I was sure you would not be back soonGod forgive me for galloping as nurse Trueman saysI declare it went against mehe's such a good creature Why do  you  know he gave me half a crown  ELEANOR  O yes the best creature in the world to be sure  BETTY  To buy me a can of flip he said to drink his old friend the Colonel's healthyour husband  elect  as he call'd him  ELEANOR  Impertinent enoughhusband  elect  indeed  BETTY  Don't abuse him tho' ma'amI hope he'll call again presently  ELEANOR  I hope  not  however if he  does  remember I positively will  not  be at home to himBut now Betty for your scheme how shall I contrive to see my dear Spritely for positively I cannot live without him  BETTY  Indeed well then I'll e'en take pity on you suppose now we could now contrive to bring him into this very house lodge him under the same roof  ELEANOR  But how dear Betty  BETTY  I have itas soon as your old lover comes home whom you expect every hourhark  Enter Servant  SERVANT  A servant madam in a blue livery brought this  ELEANOR  Turn'd up with yellow  SERVANT  Giving a letter  Yes madam and desir'd me to give it into your own hands immediately  ELEANOR  Looking at the direction  Ay 'tis he  BETTY  Who ma'am  ELEANOR  Why who should it be but the Colonel  BETTY  Lud bless us  he  here already  ELEANOR  To the servant  Let him wait below till his master comes  Exit Servant  ELEANOR  Your old admirer Martin I suppose  looks at the letter and reads  "This moment arrived from Dover and will be with you in five minutes"bless me Betty I am all of a tremblewhat shall I do  BETTY  O if the enemy's at our gates ma'am there is no time to be lost in in as fast as possible and undress yourself you look horribly handsome as you are  ELEANOR  Undress childwhat dost thou mean  BETTY  Mean madam why did not you tell me just now you could not bear the thought of  marrying the Colonel what have you to do then but to  undress  to look as old and ugly as you can that he may be indifferent about you and give up the contract  ELEANOR  Admirable thoughtthou art my best of monitors  BETTY  And yet it will take a world of pains to make so fine a woman as Miss Eleanor Briggs look plain  ELEANOR  O your humble servant madam now must I wear two faces  BETTY  That you have done a great while by the by  aside  O yes madam be very fond of your husband and not care a farthing for him 'tis all the fashion ma'am quite the  bon ton  I assure you  ELEANOR  Well but my dear girl you have not let me into your real scheme about Spritely yet  BETTY  Presently presently ma'amlud you are so impatient but let us go into your dressingroom they may shew him in here and we shall be interrupted come come in in and I'll unriddle  Exeunt  Enter COLONEL and MARTIN ushered in by a servant  SERVANT  Pray Sir walk in I'll let my mistress know SirI'm glad to see your honour look so well  COLONEL  Thank you Charles desire your mistress not to hurry herself  Exit servant  for I should be full as well pleased if she did not come at all I suppose by this time Martin she's fainting at the news of my arrival  MARTIN  O yes Sir such a perfusion I suppose of hartshorn and salvoletilethese meetings of old lovers are so affecting  COLONEL  Or affected Martin  MARTIN  I suppose they can hardly keep life and soul in her poor soul it's a miracle if she survives it I wish it was over with all my heart  COLONEL  And so do I with all my soul  MARTIN  If she should not get over it Sir  COLONEL  Well what then  MARTIN  Why to be sure it would be dreadful  COLONEL  Terrible shocking  MARTIN  But then you know Sir 'twou'd annul the contract  COLONEL  True Martin we must endeavour to reconcile these thingsI'm a philosopher you know  MARTIN  Let me see Sir 'tis now about sixteen years since you saw her last Miss Eleanor I'm afraid must be pretty far advanced by this time  COLONEL  Why yes Martin I'm afraid soand yet she's an amiable woman with a thousand good qualities and if we could call back some twenty odd springs or so I should prefer her tobut this little Maria whom I have brought over with me has got such hold of my heartby the bywhere have you lodged her Martin  MARTIN  O not far off Sir she's within call  COLONEL  If we could but find an opportunity of introducing her into the family put her off for a relation or so  MARTIN  That may be easily done Sir  COLONEL  But what say you to my appearance do I look old and ugly enough  MARTIN  O yes Sir old and ugly enough in conscience  COLONEL  I would wish to be as disagreeable in  her  eyes as I am sure she will be in mine  MARTIN  O I warrant she'll let you off easily enough  COLONEL  Heaven grant she may and thenfor my sweet MariaI'll send for the best taylor in town have a wig made as the advertisement says to imitate nature recover my dancing at the school for grown gentlemen and be as young and jemmy as the best of 'em  MARTIN  Hushhushmethinks I hear the rustling of silks mind your p's and q's Sir don't forget your sighs and raptures now for heaven's sake  COLONEL  Here she comes egad  MARTIN  Peeping  There the old fright is sure enough now Sir

then given me once more to beholdO support me or I diehe's a horid creature  Aside to Betty  COLONEL  After so many years of tedious absence again to look on those dear eyes to taste these balmy lips  Embrace again  She stinks like a polecat  Aside to Martin  ELEANOR  Passing him from her  Fie Colonel I cannot bear itOh it is too much  BETTY  Aside  It is indeed  COLONEL  Turning to Martin  O Martin this is insupportable  MARTIN  Aside  Very well Sir extremely well keep it up  BETTY  Aside  Now madam mind your cue  ELEANOR  Colonel I vow and protest I blush at my own behaviour but excess of joy betray'd me into a weakness unbecoming the delicacy of my sex  COLONEL  Not in the least my lovely EleanoraI'm glad she's come down a little however  Aside to Mart  Passion like ours my dear is above forms and after such an absence love must be allow'd to plead his own cause with warmth and energy  ELEANOR  I grant it Colonel but after all we are not quite so young as when we parted last the world perhaps will say these raptures don't become us so well as they might some few years ago  COLONEL  Why really my dear in spite of all my passion I must subscribe to your opinion but you were always the pattern of prudence and discretion the time is come as you say when we should endeavour to moderate the affections indeed my dear ours were far too violent  MARTIN  Aside  To last long I thought  ELEANOR  Ay Colonel we should endeavour to be calm a little  COLONEL  True my dear to look upon one another as I may say with a kind of coolness  ELEANOR  Ay a sort of affected indifference  COLONEL  Let our love gradually subside into esteem  ELEANOR  And mellow into friendship O the joys of virtuous friendship Don't you think Colonel time has made dreadful havoc with these poor features  COLONEL  Why really no not much the bloom indeed is a little off the plumbbut to be sure as  to myself I am not the same mansadly altered you see  ELEANOR  Very little I think the crowsfoot on your right eye is a little larger indeed but otherwise you are just the same you were fifteen years ago  COLONEL  For your sake I wish I were but old age creeps upon meit does indeed And then this nervous weaknessO I have suffered dreadfully with the rheumatism  ELEANOR  Not so much as I have  COLONEL  This cough will make an end of me soon  Coughs violently  ELEANOR  O mine's a thousand times worse  They cough at each other  Hark what noise is that  COMMODORE  Without  I tell you I  will  come up and be d'd to you  COLONEL  As I live my old friend the Commodore  ELEANOR  'Tis he sure enough

God bless your honour for your goodness they're a couple of sweet creatures that they are I told 'em of your honour's generosity I'm sure Mr Martin and I'll do any thing to serve your honour and I

we always hang out false colours to deceive the enemy I did it all last war or I shou'd not have so many shiners in my pocket  BETTY  And now Sir all we have to do is to prevent  COMMODORE  These two shatter'd old hulks from splitting on the rocks I'll send a fireship out and blow 'em up firstlet me see  pausing  aye that will do The best part of our plot is yet behind my girl always close your line of battle with a first ratethat's my maxim  Enter MARTIN peeping  MARTIN  Mrs Betty Mrs Betty where are you  BETTY  Here here man what's the matter come in there's nobody here but the Commodore

lovers will ruin all and spoil our sport with the old ones  COMMODORE  How so  MARTIN  I heard them just now making an appointment to meet in the blue room to settle matters as they call'd it If my master or your mistress should over hear them  COMMODORE  By Neptune the luckiest thing that could happen the very point in the compass that blows fairest for us Now first and second mate observe my orders  Takes hold of both their hands  MARTIN  and  BETTY  Yes your honour  COMMODORE  Let 'em be seen  BETTY  By whom  COMMODORE  By  your  mistress Let 'em be overheard  MARTIN  By whom  COMMODORE  By  your  masterHave you never a back staircase never an old screen to stand behind  BETTY  O Sir if that be all in the next room are two of the most convenient closets for an eves dropper not a word nor a whisper can escape  COMMODORE  That's fortunate indeed then stow your lumber theredo you Martin convey the Colonel to one and let Betty shut up her mistress in the other give 'em a hint first of the lovers design and jealousy will do the rest  MARTIN  But won't this precipitate matters Sir  COMMODORE  O leave that to me if this does not open their eyes let 'em sink like a couple of blind puppies and go to the bottom  BETTY  But what's to become of your honour  COMMODORE  O I shall wrap myself up in the shrouds peep at 'em from above then drop souse down upon deck like a waterspout and overwhelm them come come every man to his gun touch the wildfire and awaybrisk brisk my lad the engagement is beginning and the first fire they say is half the battle I'll be with 'em I warrant you if

command of the vessel 'till I get you safe into port and then you may  supersede me  if you pleaseIf I say it I'll do it that's the humour of Commodore Capstern  ELEANOR  I protest Commodore you're an arbitrary monarch  COMMODORE  Where there's a good king as we always have at sea 'tis the best government take my  word for itcome come my worthy friend and most amiable cousin if you have not a mind that the whole world should laugh at you for a couple of ideots fulfil your old contract marry and be happy Go go  pushes them forward  settle your matters immediately I think I have powder and shot

Ha ha ha well Commodore now the jest is overwe had only a mind to hum you  a littleyou could never believe I seriously meant to marry that giggling girl there  COMMODORE  No to be sure my little Cambyses  ELEANOR  Or that I when all the world knows I am turn'd of thirty would throw myself away on a military macaroni of eighteen  COMMODORE  Never my good Sysigambis never so if you please we'll e'en send for the parson and tack you together  COLONEL  Ay tomorrow morning if you will  COMMODORE  To night by heavenSpritely Maria come give your uncle and aunt joy like a dutiful nephew and niece as you are  COLONEL  No more of that as thou lov'st me Hal  Come old girl give me thy hand and I think we should join in thanking our good preserver here for giving us an opportunity of doing that now which if we had follow'd our own foolish inclinations we should in vain have wish'd to do a twelvemonth hence  ELEANOR  Well Commodore I'll give the Colonel my hand but you must promise to secure us from ridicule at all points you must not send your small shot after us  COMMODORE  O no you have struck your flag begg'd for quarter and there's an end of it A British conqueror never insults a fallen enemy And now my young friends have you any objection to following a good example  SPRITELY  None at allI'll answer for both but matrimony you know Sir is a long voyage and who shall fit out the vessel for us  ELEANOR  O that gentleman  COMMODORE  With all my heart The pleasure of riches is to be able to give to those that deserve 'em and the more shiners one has the more pleasure there is in dispensing 'em that's my maxim As they are going to lose their uncle and aunt the loss cannot be better supplied than by a father I have adopted them therefore for my own and to shew you I'm no bad relation shall present them with ten thousand pounds to begin the world with  MARIA  Generous creature O Spritely how shall we repay our noble benefactor  COMMODORE  By loving one another better and better every day and if your uncle and aunt had but a cap full of gratitude they would contribute to stow your locker a littlewhat say youthey have a long voyage to make in a dangerous  sea a young pilot and little provision but love  COLONEL  Why Commodore as far as a few barrels of biscuits and beer  COMMODORE  Well said and my cousin here I'll answer for her will not grudge to throw in some check shirts a hammock and trowsers  ELEANOR  I sha'n't scruple to follow the Colonel's example  COMMODORE  Then we'll furnish the slops I warrant I'll tell you what Frank the greatest pleasure an honest man can enjoy aboard of this world is to contribute to the happiness of the whole crew Give me thy hand boy coz I give thee joy with all my heart did not I tell you I'd dance at your wedding tonight if I say it I'll do'tthat's the humour of Commodore Capstern And now my brave boys and girls you're all bound I find for the same portI wish you a pleasant voyage and before you go let an experienced  old Tar  give you a few sailing orders  SONG  All you who set sail for the land of delight  Who in wedlock's soft hammock would swing ev'ry night  If you hope that your voyage successful shall prove  Fill your sails with affection your cabbins with love  Fill your sails c  Let your hearts like your mainmast be ever upright  And the union you boast like your tackle be tight  Of the shoals of indiff'rence be sure to keep clear  And the quicksands of jealousy never come near  And the quicksands c  If vapours and whims like sea sickness prevail  You must spread all your canvas and catch the fresh gale  But if brisk blows the wind and there comes a rough sea  Then lower your topsails and scud under lee  Then lower c  If husbands you hope to live peaceable lives  Keep the reckoning yourselves give the helm to your wives  For the evener we go boys the better we sail  And on shipboard the head is still rul'd by the tail  And on shipboard c  Then listen to  Capstern  my lads and be wise  If my precepts you scorn and my maxims despise  A brace of proud antlers your brows may adorn  And a hundred to one but you double  CapeHorn  And a hundred c  FINIS
