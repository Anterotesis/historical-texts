 THE  BATTIAD  CANTO the First  LONDON  Printed for G SMITH near  TempleBar  Price Sixpence MDCCL  THE  BATTIAD  CANTO the First  AWAKE my Muse whate'er thy Name may be  Or sprung from heav'nly seed or low degree  Whether thou equal'st  Garth  's majestic rage  Or crawl'st like  Blackmore  thro' the drowsy Page  Much it imports the Bus'ness to explain  That shook the puny state of  WarwickLane  Then thriceinvok'd expand thy raven's wing  Vast is the task for thou hast much to sing  o  k  to thee I dedicate my lays  Tho' no  Degree  thy equal merit raise  Yet shall your skill to latest times indure  Like  Graduates  oft you kill like them you sometimes cure  'Twas now the day when Fellows Fellows meet  To talk of weighty matters then to eat  Mean while the Patient from his tyrant free  Inhales fresh health and lives without a Fee  First  BATTUS  came deepread in worldly art  Whose tongue ne'er knew the secrets of his heart  In mischief mighty tho' but mean of size  And like the  Tempter  ever in disguise  See him with aspect grave and gentle tread  By slow degrees approach the sickly bed  Then at his Club behold him alter'd soon  The solemn Doctor turns a low Buffoon  And he who lately in a learned freak  Poach'd ev'ry  Lexicon  and publish'd  Greek  Still madly emulous of vulgar Praise  From  Punch  's forehead wrings the dirty bays  But who is that whose gogling Eyeballs scowl  Like the full Orbs of the  Cecropian  fowl  Hail  POCUS  HailYe Midwives sound his fame  Ye Nurses sing in Lullabies his Name  'Tis his to ease from pangs the lab'ring wife  And tug the little Offspring into life  As blind  Tiresias  on a luckless day  Lost his first Sex as antient Poets say  So purring  POCUS  once scarce known to fame  Of an unskilful Leach a Matron grave became  Him  Granta  saw and bade her learned Vest  Bind his broad Shoulders and embrace his Chest  Yet never quaff'd he of her sacred stream  No Muse inspiring waits his morning dream  The Scarlet Robe its heavy Wearer mocks  So sits a Racer's Saddle on an Ox  As he pass'd by a num'rous tribe succeeds  Thick as in standing corn the purple weeds  Names you could hardly think did e'er exist  But that you see them in the  College List  Slowfooted  The epithet  swiftfooted  given to  Achilles  who was famous for slaying Mankind is by being reversed a most high compliment on the Learned Gentleman to whom it is applied  Adms  hobbled in the throng  And  Dd  a Giant Spectre slouch'd along  Then  Brn  march'd onward deep in physic leer  And chatt'ring  Chny  wriggled in the rear  Each  Aesculapian  Sage assumes his seat  When  BATTUS  thus forestalls the promis'd treat  "Ere yet we on the choicest viands dine  "Ere the deep glass be dy'd with gen'rous wine  "Think think my friends what mischiefs threat our State  "Now Ruin perches on our Collegegate  "There Graduate  Schomberg  for his answer stands  "Examin'd thrice his ent'rance loud demands  "But by yon Pile where on the chissel'd stone  "The wellwrought Madman seems to live and groan  "  here on clean straw sequester'd in th    "The Patriot Sage and Bard immortal dwells  "I swear my soul detests the hated league  "And Hell if Heav'n should fail shall second my Intrigue  "Sooner shall rivers to their springs return  "Or  WarwickLane  at sickly seasons mourn  "Sooner shall roses bloom upon the main  "Fish sport in woods nay I turn  The Ed  tor is in doubt with himself whether it should not be  Wig  for  Battus  is as apt to turn his wig for the entertainment of his company as his coat for his own private emolument  Whig  again  "Than  Schomberg  in our College find a place  "This interdicting hand shall crush his race  "What tho' he claim admittance as his right  The pow'r of numbers makes a raven white  "Our  AlmaMater  shall in vain protest  "'Tis mine to make her bow her haughty crest  "Down down with  Cam  and  Isis  rev'rend schools  "Shall we proceed on dull exploded rules  "Now welcome those on  Leman  's banks who feed  "The fat  Batavian  and the Sons of  Tweed  "These in full swarms shall all our  College  fill  "And claim an equal privilege to kill  "While I superior to the rest shall fit  "A  Lect'rer Mimic Editor  and  Wit  "Nor ask what cause inflames my stubborn hate  "My settled purpose is as fix'd as Fate  "Reject our Claimant nor his threat'nings fear  "OURSELF thro' Law's wild maze will guide you clear  "'Till ev'ry Court my deep address shall own  "Whatare your  BATTUS'  arts so little known"  He said and paus'd the Midwife rear'd his size  Rolling from side to side his  An epithet that so much exalted the beauty of  Homer  's  Juno  must no doubt pass an high compliment on the grace of feature of our incomparable Midwife  Oxlike eyes  And while the scarlet Heroes he address'd  Thick eructations half his speech suppress'd  "By  Aedepol  It was the custom of the  Roman  Ladies to swear by  Castor  as the Men did by  Hercules  An asseveration by the Temple of  Pollux  was made use of by both sexes and therefore aptly put in the mouth of the Midwife  Aedepol  my  BATTUS  here I swear  "I undismay'd with thee will greatly dare  "With thee I'll misinterpret meanings strain  "Or wade thro' miry roads of deep chicane  "As Hounds together in one couple ty'd  "As  Pope  and  Devil  sitting side by side  "As  Mountebank  and quaint  JackPudding  join  "So ever mix thy friendly name with mine  "Nor think I've idly slept you know my trade  "Is Nature's dark recesses to invade  "Thro' alleys groping lo I set to view  "The affidavit of an halfstarv'd  Halfstarv'd  Jew  Pocus  by his great skill in the occult sciences found out a  Jew  in a certain corner of the town and got him to make an affidavit that  Schomberg  was born abroad which was true in fact for he never saw  England  'till he was two or three years old and in consequence of not being a native was incapable of being admitted Fellow at least this was the joint opinion of  Battus  and  Pocus  Jew  "And did not I my critic skill display  "See my epistle upon  O  and  A  While  Schomberg  was carrying on his bill of Naturalization an anonymous letter was written to the Spr of the He of Cmmns purporting that  Schomberg  intended to impose upon the Part for whereas he of late spelt his name with an O he or his father used formerly to write it with an A The Midwife is for many reasons suspected to be the author of this letter for among others two witnesses are ready to depose upon oath that he can write  O  and  A  "Man haughty Man indebted to the Brutes  "Assumes that name which best his nature suits  "Heroes are Lions in an human shape  "A Fox the Statesman and the Beau an Ape  "Then to reward the yearnings of my soul  "Salute your Midwife by the name of  Mole  "Nor think I'll ever from your banners fly  "I  Schomberg  hate nor know the reason why  "Perhaps too oft his busy Sire I meet  "That cursed chariot rolls thro' ev'ry street  "PerhapsI know not what inflames my rage  "But youthful ardor thaws my frozen age  "Sleepless I lye I foam I toss I rave  "Mad as the Priestess in  Apollo  's cave  "Let  Heberden  his views by truth direct  "Let  Reeve  oppose an obstinate  Elect  "Let  Leatherland  be stubborn to his trust  "Fainthearted wretch who dares not be unjust  "Ourselves sit here above the dread of law  "Each pow'rful  Fellow  is a grim Bashaw  "Tho' when from hence he drives his painted wain  "He shrinks into his Nothingness again  "Then hear your  POCUS  my Associates dear  "Drive  Schomberg  hence nor yield to idle fear  "So  Child  's and  Batson  's shall your triumphs tell  "And ev'ry Parish toll her  PassingBell  "Then gentle Brethren give your kind assent"  He ceas'd the Rabble roar'd "content content"  Loud was the dinThus prouling out for food  The cackling mother leads the waddling brood  If ought disturb them all together cry  And the hoarse clangor echoes thro' the sky  Goose answers goose with dissonance of voice  And  Sarum  's steeples catch the grating noise  The End of the First Canto Shortly will be published  The  BATTIAD  Canto the Second
