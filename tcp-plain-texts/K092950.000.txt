 ESSAYS UPON Several Subjects IN LAW  Sciz  JUS TERTII  BENEFICIUM CEDENDARUM ACTIONUM  VINCO VINCENTEM  PRESCRIPTION  EDINBURGH  Printed by R FLEMING and COMPANY and sold at Mr  James M'Euen  's Shop MDCCXXXII Price Two Shillings  THE following little Pieces Fruits of some Leisure Hours are  exposed  with the same Indifference they were  conceived  If they prove useful the End is gain'd If not there's no great Harm done No Man will grudge the Author the Satisfaction of a laudable Attempt He shall grudge no Man the Privilege of Reading or Neglecting of Approving or Condemning  Jus Tertii  _WHEN a Man pleads any Point in which he has no LEGAL INTEREST  i e  from the gaining of which he can propose to himself no  just  or  reasonable  Advantage he is remov'd  personali objectione  from pleading such Point For the Law encourages no Man to stand in the Way of his Neighbour unless his own Interest be at Stake  This personal Objection is express'd commonly by the Name of  JUSTERTII  And the Position runs thus  "That it is  jus tertii  to found upon any Alledgance which does not terminate in the legal Interest of the Proponer but of a third Party"  Which comes in plain  English  to this  "Sir You are not pleading for your self but for another"  And this is the true Touchstone to discover when the  Jus Tertii  is well or ill founded If the Proponer can show he has any  legal Interest  any  just  Benefit or Advantage in making  the Alledgance this personal Objection of  Jus Tertii can never lie against him  In the Application of this Doctrine the greatest Difficulty is in judging  what is a legal Interest  that every  accidental  or  occasional  Benefit does not come up to a  legal Interest  is plain As to this Matter all Arguments drawn from possible Contingencies are cut off A legal Interest must be something fix'd somewhat the Proponer is founded in Law to plead upon and to be cut out of which he can subsume upon as an Act of Injustice This falls to be estimated and judg'd of by the Situation the Proponer is in from the Nature of his Claim and Relation to his Party  For Example A Nullity of the Execution of a Warning against a Tenant to remove being objected against an Adjudger whose Adjudication was expired by another who was not within the Year of him but both were infeft the Lords found the Nullity not competent for that second Adjudger to object unless he were either preferable or to come in  pari passu  and therefore repelled it as  jus tertii  to him  Fountainhal Forbes  th  June    Rule  contra  Purdie  So far the Matter is clear  In a Removing against a Tenant the Defender was not allowed to plead upon the Right of a third Party as preferable to the Pursuer unless he would subsume upon some Right made to him by the third Party  Erskine  Col  Stuart  contra Laird of  Grange  For here the Tenant could not figure the smallest Advantage in pleading upon the Right of the third Party unless it were  mo  A Possibility that the third Party would not turn him out  do  That for one Year at least he could not not having given any Warning to the Tenant  Both which being  accidental  and  contingent  the Law respects not as not coming up to a  legal Interest  or such a reasonable Benefit which being cut out off he can subsume that he has met with material Injustice Which a Tenant can never say who is remov'd upon a legal Warning by any Person having a colourable Title to the Lands All his legal Interest is to pay his Rent securely it belongs not at all to him to object against the Pursuer's Title providing  ex facie  it appear to be good or to dip into the Question Whether some third Party may not have a better Title  The like is observ'd by  Colvil December  Countess of  Errol contra  Tenants where a Liferent being competent to a Lady by her Husband who was only Liferenter himself in an Action of Removing against Tenants at her Instance after her Husband's Decease this Exception that her Liferent was extinct by her Husband's Decease was repelled as being  jus tertii  to the Tenants  Another Example is mentioned by  Spotiswood voce Escheat and Liferent  d  March    Murray  contra Commissary of  Dunkeld  In a special Declarator of the Commissary of  Dunkeld  's Escheat pursued by Mr  Patrick Murray  the Defender propon'd an Alledgance upon the ordinary Backbond given to the Treasurer by the Donatar which bore that he should not use the Gift to the Prejudice of the Rebel's Creditors This the Rebel alledged might be propon'd in his own Name as well as the Creditors seeing he was interested to see his Creditors rather paid by his own escheatable Goods than that the Donatar should meddle therewith and the Creditors be obliged to have Recourse to his Lands or his Person The Lords  repelled this as not competent to be proponed in the Rebel's own Name Here the Rebel had a plain and fix'd Interest but still he was denied the Benefit of the Alledgance because it was not a  legal Interest sciz  such an Interest or Benefit he was intitled to by Law Because a Backbond of the Nature mentioned in the Decision can have no Respect to the Advantage of the Rebel whose Escheat falls  in modum poenae  but respects solely the Creditors and therefore the Creditors may plead upon it the Rebel never can  In a Declarator of Property the Defender pretending no Right in his own Person was not suffered to make any Objection against the Pursuer's Title  Stair    July  Lord  Fraser  contra Laird of  Philorth  Here the Defender by making the Alledgance and removing the Pursuer could have no other View but to retain Possession for some Time longer which is so far from a legal Interest that it is plainly injustifiable In respect it is more reasonable to give him the Possession who has some colourable Title than to allow it to remain with the Person who has no Pretence at all  And in a Declarator of the Property of Teinds tho' the Title of the Process was a Progress exceedingly ill connected and labouring under many Infirmities yet the Lords sustain'd the Title in the same Way as if the Action had been a Reduction and Improbation of LandRights and found it to be sufficient against naked Heritors pretending no Right to the Teinds of their Lands and that it was  jus tertii  for them to object against it The Defenders yielded that any presumptive Title might do in a Question of Lands because no Man can pretend the smallest Interest in or to Lands but in consequence  of some Conveyance some written Document which if he has not it is indeed  jus tertii  to object against any presumptive Title in the Person of another But that could never happen in a Question of Teinds because an Heritor's Right to the Lands suppose he has none to the Teinds gives him a sufficient  Title  and plain  Interest  to object against any Man's being declared Titular of his Teinds Which was inforced from these Considerations  mo  That every Heritor has a Right to have his Teinds declared free rather than the Property of any Man and that because several legal Interests arise to him thereby  do  Every Heritor has an Interest that his Teinds should belong to the Crown rather than to a Subject the  Exchequer  being in use to grant Tacks to Heritors of their Teinds at a very easy Rate and rather to belong to the Patron from whom they can acquire at six Years Purchase than to any other Titular who can demand nine  The Question comes precisely here Whether the Alledgance made for the Defenders amounted to a  legal Interest  such a Benefit as it was unjust to deprive them of That it is a  legal Interest  the Court was of Opinion th  November    Mitchel  contra  Baillie  and  Shearer  observed by  Forbes  where a Charter of Adjudication of the Teinds of certain Lands with Infeftment thereon was not found a sufficient Title to oblige the Heritor of the Lands to make Payment of the Teinds without producing the Adjudication itself and instructing a Right to them in the Person of him they were adjudged from albeit no other Right appeared to compete  A Vassal being pursued by a Purchaser of the Superiority made this Defence That the Seller's Relict was infeft as conjunct Fiar and that he the Defender was bound to acknowledge none other for his Superior during her Lifetime which was sustained  ColvilMay  Laird of  Capringtoun  contra Laird of  Caldwells  This Alledgance was not  jus tertii  because Vassals have a legal Interest to keep their Charterchests shut against every one but their proper Superior  Having thus given a general Idea of my Subject the Application thereof will best be seen by Induction of particular Cases Which for Clearness Sake I shall range under different Heads  POSITION I  A Debitor pursued by an Assigney is founded in an Interest to alledge that it appears  ex facie scripturae  or is otherwise necessarily consistent with his Knowledge that there is no Right in the Assigney's Person because in this Case he cannot pay safely But if  ex facie scripturae  by the Production it appear that the Assigney's Right is founded the Debitor cannot be allowed to plead upon any Exception to take away the Assigney's Right unless it be so notorious as necessarily to superinduce a  mala fides  Such an Exception is  jus tertii  as to him he has no Interest in it all his Concern is to pay safely and he pays safely when he pays to the Man who has the Face of a Title especially  interposita authoritate praetoris  As to the first Branch of the Position see  Durie March    Ramsay  contra  Mackieson  Here  a Debitor being pursued by his Creditor upon a Bond it was found competent for him to propone this Alledgance That the Pursuer's Escheat was gifted and the special Declarator intimated to him the Debitor which Declarator though afterwards passed from as to him by the Donatar was equivalent as if the Pursuer had been denuded by an Assignation intimate and therefore he could not pay  bona fide  As to the second Branch see  Durie    December    Hamilton  contra  Durham  in which this Exception proponed by a Party in whose Hands Arrestment was laid was repelled as being  jus tertii sciz  That the Arrester could not demand the Sum to be made furthcoming in regard he had recovered Payment from the common Debitor  James Ballantine  took a Bond payable to himself and after his Decease to  Ballantine  his Son  John Ballantine  's Name was afterwards filled up in this Bond though he was born after the Date thereof and he was found to have good Action as a Substitute against the Debitor who had no Interest to debate how  John  's Name came into the Bond that being  jus tertii  seeing there was no other Heir or Child pretending Right  Stair Dirleton    January    Ballantine  contra  Edgar  A Debitor objecting against the Donatary of his Creditors Forfeiture That the Creditor himself was only an Executor which being an Office could not be assigned far less could be carried away by the Forfeiture except as to the Executor's own Share the Lords found this Alledgance  jus tertii  to the Debitor and therefore repelled it  Fountainhall    th November    Graham  contra  Lin  There may be some Doubt as to this Decision The Pursuer here had not even a colourable Title The Defect appeared  ex facie scripturae  It seems incumbent upon a Defender to take Notice of such a Defect and upon the Judge to sustain it for the Benefit of those who shall really be found to have the  jus exigendi  POSITION II  It is not  jus tertii  in a Defender to found upon the Right of a third Party when the Intent is only to make out that he himself is not liable  In a Pursuit for liquidating the Avail of a Marriage it being alledged by the Donatary That it was  jus tertii  for the apparent Heir to say that his Father died not in the Fie as being denuded by an Adjudger who was publickly infeft unless that Adjudger would appear and defend the Lords found That it was not  jus tertii  but competent to the apparent Heir to found upon it  Fountainhall    February  Lord  Rae  contra  Innes  POSITION III  When Payment is offered to a Creditor it is  jus tertii  for him to object that the Person is not entitled to make the Offer because a Creditor is bound to accept of Payment from whatever Hand  A Party served and retoured Heir to a Defunct offering to redeem an Adjudger who alledged that  the Party to whom the Heir was retoured was presumed alive his Death not being instructed the Lords found That the Alledgance was  jus tertii  to the Adjudger and sustained Process at the Heir's Instance upon the Retour produced in regard there was no nearer Heir quarrelling the same  July    Hay  contra  Dobbie  The Matter comes here An Adjudication within the Legal which was the Case here being only a Security for Debt may be extinguished by whoever offers Payment After Expiration of the Legal when it becomes a Right of Property the Adjudger is not bound to debate the Relevancy of Objections tending to annul his Right or open the Legal unless with a Person connecting a good Title to the Lands  In the Redemption of a Wadset by an Appriser of the Reversion it was found  jus tertii  for the Wadsetter to alledge the Apprising was fallen by Prescription  Fountainhall    November    Nicol  contra  Park  Here the Prescription might have been interrupted and it was not reasonable to oblige the Appriser to enter into this Dispute with a Person who had no other Interest but to get Payment But this Matter is not without some seeming Difficulty for if a Wadset be considered only as a bare Security for Money there does not a Reason occur why it should not be extinguishable by any Person whatever offering Payment If it be considered as a Right of Property in Lands redeemable only by the Reverser himself and those deriving Right from him by effectual Conveyances upon that Supposition the Wadsetter ought to be allowed to make every Objection against the Title of the Redeemer and in my Opinion would be well  founded in the Objection of Prescription mentioned in the Case  POSITION IV  It is not  jus tertii  in an apparent Heir to alledge That the Pursuer has no  jus agendi  though the apparent Heir refuses to acknowledge the passive Titles  The Reason is That regularly before the Defender is obliged to recur to any Defences the Pursuer must show that he is founded in his Action and unless he make out this Point the Defender is not obliged to say whether he represents or not being founded in a legal Interest to keep this Matter private from every one save the Defunct's just Creditors Thus then an apparent Heir without involving himself in the passive Titles may propone every Objection against the Pursuer's Claim that arises  ex facie scripturae  or that he can otherwise instantly verify Objections indeed that require a Proof stand upon another Footing Not that it is  jus tertii  in the Defender to propone them the Reason why the apparent Heir after proponing such Objections is not suffered to deny the passive Titles is allenarly the Hardship upon the Creditor in obliging him to sustain a long Proof which cannot possibly be of any Benefit to him so long as the Defender has in it his Power to deny the passive Titles  POSITION V  In a Competition betwixt two Rights to the same Subject whereof the one under which my Competitor claims is in it self preferable it is  jus tertii  for me to object That his Progress is not well connected which is only competent to one having a more compleat Progress to the same Right or Interest  For Example  A  has an absolute good Progress to the Infeftment  X B  has but a lame Progress to the Infeftment  Y  Yet  B  is preferred  Y  being supposed the preferable Infeftment And the Reason is It is just to give  B  who has at least a doubious Title a Preference to  A  who can have no Pretence as long as the Infeftment  Y  is in the Field The respective  Interests  produced are ranked according to their legal Preference And the Persons claiming upon these Interests if they have any Appearance of a connected Title take their Places accordingly This being premised it is obvious That  A  can have no  legal Interest  to impugn  B  's Progress For tho' it should be found That  C  has Right to the Infeftment  Y  and not  B  that does not benefit  A  he can propose to himself no Advantage by gaining the Point because in that Case the Judge would prefer  C  and not  A  The Right of a Feu Vassal being apprised from him and the Apprising again dispon'd to another the Superior's Heir raised Reduction and Improbation against the Disponee and obtained Certification against the principal Sasine on the original Charter  and against the Grounds and Warrants of the Apprising Notwithstanding of which it was found  jus tertii  in the Pursuer to quarrel the Want of these Writs in respect that as Heir to the Ganter of the original Feu Charter he was liable to warrant it  Fountainhall    February  Earl of  Forfar  contra  Gilhaigie  Observed also by Mr  Forbes  as of  January  For the original Feu Charter which was produced being plainly preferable to the Pursuer's Claim of Property since he was debarred thereby it was the same Thing to him who was Vassal in that Question he could have no legal Interest  In two mutual Declarators touching the Right of a Salmond Fishing the one produced a Charter from his Majesty with a well connected Progress down to the Time of the Competition the other produced a Right from a Subject of a much older Date but not well connected for many of the interveening Years in so much that his Progress so much of it as was well connected did not go so far back as his Competitor's Yet it was found That the Person deriving Right from his Majesty had no  Interest  to object the Want of Midcouples to the other And that it was  jus tertii  and incompetent for him to object and obtrude that Defect unless he derived Right from the same Author or any succeeding in his Right  Fountainhall    December    Forbes  of  Watertoun  contra  Udney  In a Competition anent the Property of Lands betwixt a less preferable Interest and an Adjudication of the preferable Interest it was found  jus tertii  in the Party compeating upon the less preferable Interest to alledge that the Adjudication was satisfied  and paid by Intromissions within the Legal  Forbes    June    Murray  contra  M'lellan  POSITION VI  In a Competition I am not allowed to found upon the Interest of a third Party as preferable to that of my Antagonist  The Proof of the immediately foregoing Position is equally applicable to this  John Murray  served himself Heir in general to  Alexander Maxwel  his Grandfather and upon that Title did compeat with  Neilson  of  Chaple  who had Adjudications in his Person led originally against the said  Alexander Maxwel  conveyed by the Creditor to  Elisabeth Maxwel  and from her to the said  Neilson  of  Chaple  It was contended for  John Murray  That  Elisabeth Maxwel  the intermediate Author had disponed these Apprisings to her Husband  Gilbert M'Cartney  and that therefore  Neilson  's Right was null as granted  a non habente potestatem  The Lords found it  jus tertii  for  John Murray  to found upon the Right of  Gilbert M'Cartney  unless he derived Right from him This was found  anno  in the Competition  Neilson  of  Chaple  and  Lanerick  of  Ladylands  with  John Murray  Here the Objection against  Neilson viz  That his Author was denuded and consequently that he could have no Right was in it self good But then his Competitor was not allowed to found upon it because he could shew no legal Interest therein For what if  Neilson  's Right should be found null That would signifie to  M'Cartney  indeed if he pleased to  appear but nothing to  Murray  who was at any Rate excluded by the Adjudications whoever had Right to them  POSITION VII  But as Law allows me to use every Argument tending to annull or cut down the Title upon which my Competitor founds when the Consequence is to prefer my own Title it is not  Jus Tertii  to found upon the Interest of a Third Party when it tends to prove not that the Third Party is preferable which would be  Jus Tertii  but that I my self am preferable by the Nullity of my Competitor's Right  X  is infeft in Lands He gives a Disposition containing Procuratory to  A  who assigns first to  B  and then to  C  but  C  is first infeft Betwixt the Dates of these two Infeftments  X  grants a Second Disposition to  D  who obtains himself infeft prior to  B  but posterior to  C  Upon the Supposition  That a personal Conveyance denudes of a personal Right  quaeritur How is this Matter to be extricated  B  is preferred to  C  upon the Footing of this Brocard  A  being supposed entirely denuded by his first Assignation in Favours of  B C  is preferred to  D  as first infeft and  D  to  B  for the same Reason And thus the Matter becomes plainly inextricable unless  D  be allowed to plead that  C  's Infeftment is null as flowing  a non habente potestatem  his Author  A  being  ab ante  denuded in Favours of  B  The Difficulty in this Cass is That it is  jus tertii  for  D  to plead upon  B  's Assignation The Answer is That this very Example must show it not to be  jus tertii  Since the Consequence would plainly be to make the  Affair inextricable which is a downright Absurdity To take a general View of the Matter it appears without Controversy that  D  is the Man who is first legally infeft and who has first denuded the common Author  X  Now if this be the plain Matter of Fact I can see no good Reason why  D  should not be allowed to found upon it It is a Rule in our Law that  alii per alium acquiritur obligatio  the Principle upon which this is founded will equally support another Rule that  alii per alium acquiritur exceptio  And when we consider the Nature of this Objection of  jus tertii  the Difficulty will evanish according to the Definition it arises from pleading a Point wherein the Party has no  Interest  and the gaining of which cannot profit him The direct contrary is the Case here for if  C  's Infeftment be found null  D  comes in of Course  To explain this Matter further let us take a View of a Decision observed by  Forbes  th  Dec  Colonel  Erskine  contra Sir  George Hamilton  in which a Person having a real Right in Lands was allowed to object against a competing Adjudication that it was null as being led upon a Bond payed by the Debitor albeit he who quarrelled the Adjudication derived no Right from the Person against whom it was led  This Decision is obviously well founded and yet therein we see a Party allowed to found upon the Deed of a third Person with whom he does not connect  viz  the Payment made to his Competitor by the common Debitor And he is allowed to do so for this precise Reason that thereby he comes to establish a Preference to himself Now I can see no Difference betwixt this Decision and the Case in Hand In both a Party is allowed to found upon  the  Deed  of a third Person with whom he has no Connection and in both he has equally a  legal Benefit  in so doing In a Word there is nothing more common in Law than to see People founding upon the  Deeds  of third Parties such Alledgances cast up in a thousand Shapes every Day If they can shew no  legal Interest  in so doing it is  jus tertii  they are debarred  personali objectione  If they can show a legal Interest they ought to be heard This is also fortified by the Doctrine contained in Position II for if a Defender can found upon the Right of a third Party in order to obtain  absolvitor  for the fame Reason may a Competitor found upon the Right of a third Party to obtain  Preference  Another Case is related by Lord  Stair  d  July    Johnston  contra  Arnold  to this Purpose In a Competition betwixt two Apprisings whereupon Infeftment had followed both led before the Act bringing in Apprisers  pari passu  The first Appriser was also first infeft But it was objected against the Infeftment by the second Appriser that it was null being in Name of an Assigney to the Apprising who did not appear to have any Right no Assignation being produced This the Lords fustained and did not find it  jus tertii  to object the Want of the said Assignation  NB  The Competition run betwixt the second Appriser and the Heir of the first Appriser who had also in his Person a Conveyance from the Assigney in whose Name Infeftment was taken  POSITION VIII  Where an Alledgance tends not to make my Party's Title absolute ly null but only reduceable or annullable at the Instance of a third Party it is jus tertii for me to found upon it  For Example a Donatar of Ward and Nonentry pursuing the Vassal for the Nonentry Duties fallen due several Years after elapsing of the Ward this Gift of Nonentry continues but three Terms after the Ward in Competition with the King or another Donatar but is still good against the Vassal and therefore it is reckoned  jus tertii  for him to found upon it  Haddington  th  July    Dickson  contra Laird  Dawick  A Spuilie was sustained altho' at committing the same the Party injured was at the Horn it being found  jus tertii  to the Defender to alledge that the Action in that Case was competent only to the King and his Donatat  Maitland  th  June  Laird  Kinfauns  contra Laird  Craigie  The Reason is That Denunciation does not  ipso facto  divest the Rebel of his Moveables he remains still Proprietor until the King pleases to take the Benefit of his Rebellion And therefore the Decision would probably have gone otherwise if the Defender could have subsumed upon a general or special Declarator at the Donatar's Instance In a Process at a Minister's Instance for his Stipend it was objected by the Heritors that he was not duely admitted by a Presentation conform to the Statute  Annae  rerestoring Patronages this was found  jus tertii  to the Heritors being competent only to the Patron himself  Forbes  th  June    M'Bain  contra  Laird of  Scatwell  In a Reduction of a Subtack upon this Ground that by a Clause therein if the Subtacksman failed in paying of his Tackduty at certain Terms the Tack should be null this Nullity was only found competent to the Tacksman himself Setter of the Subtack not to the Master in Respect it was not an absolute Nullity but in Favours of the Tacksman if he pleased to lay hold upon it  Durie  th  Dec  Earl of  Galloway  contra  M Culloch  It may be worth Notice that this Position does not so directly come under the Doctrine of  jus tertii  In the Decisions just now mentioned the Alledgeances were repelled not so much upon the Footing of a  jus tertii  that the Proponer had no Interest to make them but truly because they were by no Means conclusive did not infer what they were brought to prove which above all is plain from the last mentioned Decision in which there was not wanting a  legal Interest  to found the Proponer in his Alledgance of Nullity he failed only in this That it was not found to be a Nullity There is a wide Difference betwixt a  null  Right and a Right  annullable  a Nullity in a  Right  may be pled upon by every one who can show an Interest in the Question the Power of annulling by no Mortal but who is vested with the Power  Beneficium cedendarum actionum  _WHen a Creditor has different Persons or Subjects bound to him for Security and Payment of his Debt it naturally arises to be a Question how far he has it in his Power to exerce his Right arbitrarily by loading one and freeing another and when he does so if there is any Relief competent to the Person or Subject overburdened Questions of this Nature may be easily solvable in the simple Cases But the Connections betwixt Persons and Subjects Creditors and Debitors preferable and secondary Securities cast up so various and intricate and run out so great a Length that one is apt to lose himself if he does not begin at Principles and go on Step by Step from the more easy to the more intricate Cases  It appears in the first Place agreeable to Principles of  Justice  and  Humanity  that Creditors having bound to them different Persons or their Effects should not be allowed ARBITRARILY to load one and exempt others There are two good Reasons for this one  a priori  the other  a posteriori  The  one  a priori  is drawn from this Law of Nature  That every Man is confined in the Way of using his Property so as to be least hurtful to others  He is allowed to prefer himself but his own Interest being out of the Question he has no longer Liberty to go on to take any Step  in aemulationem vicini  either by directly doing Damage or by using the Pretext of his Property  arbitrarily  to prejudge one for the Benefit of another To take this in somewhat a different Light  Property  was introduced not that Men should be indulged to use it wantonly but only in so far as beneficial to themselves Therefore every Man may use his Property while his private Interest goes along There his  Power  is at an End After that the Law takes it out of his Hands and directs it so as in the whole to do most Good to others And when the Matter is brought there it is plain that the Law which is no Respecter of Persons never acts  arbitrarily  but deals to every one with an equal Hand The Consideration  a posteriori  is drawn from the numberless Inconveniencies that might ensue if Creditors were indulged in this arbitrary Proceeding It would naturally introduce underhand fraudulent Pactions betwixt the Creditor who holds the Ballance and some one or other of the Debitors in order to throw the Burden upon others Every one would endeavour to bribe highest to get himself relieved And thus Bribery and Corruption would go on to the Destruction of Debitors whereby their Creditors would have an Opportunity of making unjust Gains by Extortion which no civilized Country will indulge  The  Roman  Law and ours go thus far Hand in Hand that a Debitor paying is entitled to demand Assignation from the Creditor against his Fellow Debitor  l    l    Fidejuss  Here the  Roman  Law stops at least that of the  Pandects  and gives no Action for Relief to one Codebitor against another where the Action is not ceded  l    Fidejuss  This is better ordered in our Law with us the Debitor who pays has directly an Action for a proportionable Relief against his Codebitor without Necessity of Assignation This is not understood to proceed from any Paction exprest or implied betwixt the  correi debendi  It flows directly from the above Principle  sciz  That a Creditor is confined from exercing his Right  arbitrarily  He ought to draw a proportional Part from every one of his Debitors or if for his own Ease he chuses to draw the whole from one it is incumbent upon him to assign his Debt and Diligence that the Person making Payment may have a proportional Relief off others and because it is a Rule  That what ought always to be done is ever held as done  the Law to abridge the unnecessary Circuit of an Assignation gives directly an Action of Relief to the Debitor making Payment against his Fellow Debitors whether he has an Assignation or not This seems to have been the Law of the  Codex l    C de duob reis  and this is our common Practice at this Day  Thus the Matter is fix'd upon the most solid and equitable Footing so far as relates to  personal Relief  amongst Fellowdebitors It must be acknowledged that our Practice is but in its Infancy as to  real Relief  that ought to be competent to the Proprietor or secondary Creditor out of whose Fund Payment is drawn against the other Funds upon which the preferable Debt is equally secured To give the plainest Example Two Persons  conjunctly and severally  oblige themselves to pay a Sum and grant each of them an heritable Bond out of their  respective Lands upon which Infeftment follows So far the Matter is clear by our Practice that the Debitor out of whose Estate the whole Sum is made effectual by virtue of the Infeftment of Annualrent has personal Relief off his Fellowdebitor But why not also real Relief That is why should he not be intitled to take up the Creditor's Infeftment upon the other Debitor's Lands in order to be ranked for that Part of the Sum which he has paid over and above his Proportion It appears without Controversy that there is the same Foundation for both It may possibly be objected That after the Debt is paid out of one Debitor's Effects the Bond falls extinguish'd with all its Consequences But in Answer to this it is urg'd  mo  That it is  jus tertii  for the Debitor himself or his real Creditors to plead upon this since in all Events no more is intended to be drawn from him than his Proportion of the Debt  do principaliter  At any Rate this might have been done by the Circuit of an Assignation Now as is above laid down the Law supplies this and grants an implied Assignation For truly the Action for Relief betwixt Codebitors whether personal or real is no other than an Action upon an implied  legal  Assignation The Matter then comes out thus From each of the Debitors the Creditor has strictly Right to demand Payment of the one Half if he chuse to poind the Ground of one of the Debitors for the whole which he may do for his own Conveniency the Law supposes that he takes the one Half in Payment of that Debitor's Proportion of the Debt but as for the other Half that is not supposed taken in Payment of a Debt which the other Debitor is ultimately liable in but as the Price of the legal  Assignation see  l    Fidejus  And therefore the Creditor's Infeftment remains still good upon the other Debitor's Lands as to that Half which may accordingly be taken up in virtue of the  legal  Assignation by the Debitor who has paid the whole The Benefit of this  legal  Assignation would be of considerable Effect in Practice Amongst others it would remove the Pretext that Debitors have to suspend real Diligence in order to obtain an actual Assignation  'Tis true no Traces appear in the  Roman  Law of this real Relief otherwise than by the Circuit of an Assignation With respect to which there is a remarkable Text  l    Pr de Cens  But neither were they acquainted with the personal Relief at least by the ancient Law However as the Foundation of real Relief is plainly laid down in the said  l    de Cens  it would be no great Stretch to establish it even in the  Roman  Law by an Argument drawn from the said  l    C de duob reis  The Principle being thus fix'd it will be easy to draw out a Rule for adjusting all the Kinds of  real  and  personal Relief  amongst Codebitors and secondary Creditors A Creditor who has several Persons bound to him in a Debt is supposed to take Payment equally and proportionally from every one of them If he chooses to draw more from any one than his Proportion this is not understood as taken in Payment but as the Price of an Assignation  actual  or  legal  This intitles the Payer to come in Place of the Creditor as to that Superplus which accordingly he may draw from the other Debitors After the very same Manner when a Catholick Creditor whose Infeftment reaches over two Tenements draws the whole out of one the Person  overburdened whether Proprietor or only a secondary Creditor ought to be intitled to act in the Creditor's Name to be refunded of the Superplus over and above his Proportion out of the other Tenement whereby  Equality  is preserved amongst all concerned and no  Person  or  Subject  bears a greater or less Burden than his Situation obliges him to And thus the Rule comes out THAT REAL OR PERSONAL RELIEF GOES NO FURTHER THAN TO BE REFUNDED OF WHAT THE SUBJECT OR PERSON HAS BEEN BURDENED WITH OVER AND ABOVE HIS PROPORTION  We must now come to Particulars and for Method's Sake it may be proper  mo  To handle such Cases as fall directly under the Rule  do  These Cases which by Reason of special Circumstances may be ranked under the Head of Exceptions  PROPOSITION I  Supposing a preferable Infeftment upon the Tenements  A  and  B  both pertaining to the common Debitor and a secondary Infeftment upon  A  only the secondary Creditor infeft in the Tenement  A  out of which Tenement the Catholick Creditor chuses to draw his whole Debt is intitled only to a proportional Relief out of the Tenement  B  tho' there be no other Infeftment upon it save that belonging to the Catholick Creditor  This is a direct Inference from the Rule above laid down The Catholick Creditor is supposed  fictione juris  to draw proportionally out of the two Tenements And if in Fact he does otherwise the  Creditor overburdened has Relief indeed but only so far as he is overburdened As to a total Assignation against the Tenement  B  it appears obvious that the secondary Creditor upon  A  is no better intitled to it than any of the personal Creditors of the common Debitor If the Fact be That he has lent more Money upon the Tenement  A  than that Portion of it will satisfy which remains after a proportional Allocation of the catholick Right he has himself to blame Upon that Supposition nothing remains to him but in common with the personal Creditors to attack that Portion of the Tenement  B  which remains after the said proportional Allocation  To take this Matter a little more at large let us examine what must be the Consequences of a Scheme where it is held that the secondary Creditor upon  A  is intitled to demand a total Assignation for his Relief against the Tenement  B  in case there is no other Burden upon it beside the catholick Infeftment Upon this Scheme it is not seen that any Creditor can well excuse himself for lending upon the Tenement  B  when there is a secondary Creditor upon  A  and a catholick Creditor over both for this would be truly defrauding the secondary Creditor of his Security If it be alledged  mo  That the secondary Creditor upon  A  when he lent his Money took his Hazard of this it is answered This is no Excuse to any Party who officiously cuts him out of his Hazard by turning it into a Certainty against him If it be said  do  That the Creditor contracting upon  B  was not bound to know of the Creditor upon  A  the Answer is That at any Rate no Creditor is safe to lend upon  B  without knowing whether there is a secondary  Creditor upon  A  because in Proportion to the Extent of the other Debt his Claim upon  B  falls to be more or less restricted Besides it is enough to qualify  mala fides  that a Man chuses to do what he sees may very possibly produce Mischief to others though the Mischief be not absolutely certain If it be said  tio  That the Creditor upon  B  does no more than any Creditor does who lends upon heritable Security knowing his Debitor to have personal Creditors The Difference is that the Tenement  B  upon the present Supposition is understood to be a Security to the Creditor upon  A  by his Right to demand Assignation preferable to all other Creditors which Security the Creditor upon  B  in Part cuts him out of Now personal Creditors have no Security upon their Debitors Lands they may effect it by Diligence but so may they the Money come in its Place From all which it appears that if it be a lawful Commerce for a Creditor to lend upon  B  while there is another secondary Creditor upon  A  and a catholick Creditor over both which cannot be disputed it must follow that the Creditor upon  A  has but a proportional Relief off the Tenement  B  even when there is no Burden upon  B  save that of the catholick Creditor's  What is said here with Respect to a Creditor lending upon  B  may be applied with equal Force to a Purchaser of the Subject  CORROLLARY  Hence in the proportional Relief betwixt the secondary Creditors the Creditor upon  B  though posterior is in no worse Situation than the Creditor upon  A  though prior  SCHOLIUM  It is laid down in the Proposition that the secondary Creditor upon  A  is  entitled  only to a proportional Relief out of the Tenement  B  Now this he can demand of  Right  and can by no Alteration of Circumstances be cut out off But at the same Time there is nothing to bar the catholick Creditor from assigning  in totum  if he pleases so long as no secondary Creditor appears upon the Tenement  B  The granting of an Assignation in such Circumstances not being a Matter of  Justice  or  Equity  in which one is tied down but of pure  Favour  the very Conception of which supposes the Action to be  voluntary  or  arbitrary  'Tis very true that in this Situation the catholick preferable Creditor has it in his Power to  favour  either the secondary Creditor upon  A  or the personal Creditors who have not attached either of the Subjects If he deny an Assignation all that remains for the secondary Creditor upon  A  after adjusting the proportional Relief is to adjudge the Tenement  B pari passu  with the personal Creditors which will entitle him to a Share of what remains of the Tenement  B  unexhausted after the proportional Relief If on the other Hand the catholick Creditor vouchafe to grant Assignation the personal Creditors have no Access unless the two Tenements do more than satisfy both the real Debts This indeed is an  arbitrary  proceeding but at the same Time not such as the Law has any Caveat against because as above laid down in Matters of  Favour  every one must act  arbitrarily  The personal Creditors having no  Nexus  upon the Tenement  B  having not so much as the Pretence of lending their Money upon the Faith of it are founded in no Title to oppose a total Assignation The catholick Creditor is not so much as bound to know that there are any personal Creditors and has no Counection or Concern with them When therefore in these Circumstances the catholick Creditor chuses to  favour  the secondary Creditor upon  A  by granting him a total Assignation this is not  cutting down  or  hurting  one Creditor in favours of another since the personal Creditors have no  Nexus  upon the Tenement  B  'tis at most but disappointing them of a Hope which may be  lucrum cessans  but is by no Means  damnum datum  'Tis another Case if the personal Creditors have by Diligence attached the Tenement  B  'Tis thought that even a bare Citation in an Adjudication is a sufficient  Nexus  upon the Tenement  B  to enforce a proportional Relief betwixt them and the secondary real Creditor upon  A  For after Citation it is no longer a Matter of  Favour  but of  Justice  and  Equity  Yet after all if there's any Appearance that a total Assignation is the Result of a Contrivance betwixt the two real Creditors to disappoint the personal Creditors 'tis left to be considered if upon that Supposition the Assignation might not be cut down upon the Head of  Collusion  And there would be the more Ground for this if such Assignation were granted after nottour Bankruptcy which indeed would be very suspicious  PROPOSITION II  Supposing still a catholick Creditor over the Tenements  A  and  B  the same proportional real Relief will he competent betwixt the secondary Creditor upon  A  and a Purchaser of the Tenement  B e contra  For there being no greater Connection betwixt the catholick and secondary Creditor than betwixt the catholick Creditor and the Purchaser there appears nothing in the Variation of Circumstances to disturb the  proportional Allocation  of the catholick Debt which brings it to the common Case If it be objected That the Purchaser upon the Obligation of  Remuneration  is entitled to a total Assignation since the catholick Debt is drawn out of his Funds whereas when it is taken out of the Tenement  A  it is drawn out of Funds that belong to the common Debitor which does not entitle the secondary Creditor to  Remuneration  the Answer is That neither is the Purchaser here entitled to  Remuneration  The catholick Creditor is not bound in any Sense to acknowledge the Purchaser When he draws his Payment out of the Tenement  B  though now no longer in his Debitor's Person he is doing no more but explicating his own Right and therefore there is no Connection no  negotium gestum inter eos  to infer any such  Remuneration  If it be urged  do  That the Purchaser in this Case being intitled to Relief off the common Debitor upon his  Warrandice  it is answered That the secondary Creditor upon  A  when he is cut out by the catholick  Creditor has as well founded a Title for Relief  CORROLLARY  If the Purchaser of the Tenement  B  retain sufficient in his Hand to satisfy the catholick Debt in that Case if the catholick Creditor draws Payment out of  A  the secondary Creditor upon that Subject is founded in an Action against the Purchaser for a proportional Relief And what is over and above in the Purchaser's Hands remains to be affected by the Diligence of all the Creditors personal and real If he chuse to draw his Payment from the Purchaser the personal Creditors are not entitled to a Relief out of the Tenement  A  see what is laid down in  Schol Prop  I  SCHOLIUM  From the whole taken together it appears to be the same whether the Subjects belong to the same or different Proprietors and whether the Persons claiming Relief be secondary Creditors or Purchasers  SCHOLIUM  The above Doctrine will hold equally in all Sorts of Diligence Infeftments of Annualrent Adjudications Inhibitions or Arrestments  PROPOSITION III  If the Catholick Creditor lend a second Sum to the common Debitor upon the Subject  A  before the Existence of any Debt upon  B  in this Case the proportional Allocation will not obtain He is at Liberty to draw his preferable Sum out of the Tenement  B  in order to make his second Debt effectual upon the Tenement  A  This follows from the first Principle For the proportional Allocation obtains only when his own Interest is out of the Question And it cannot be said that he acts  arbitrarily  in drawing his preferable Debt out of  B  when he has the reasonable View of saving his other Debt upon  A  Nor is any one prejudg'd thereby since it is easy to know from the Records what Debts are upon the Tenement  A  Before a Creditor is in safety to lend upon  B  it is requisite at any Rate to know what Burdens are upon  A  preferable to the Catholick Infeftment And it is not a great additional Trouble to search forward to the present Time Add to this as a Matter without Dispute that the Catholick Creditor  rebus integris  may renounce either of his Securities to the Debitor and by the same Reason therefore may he lend  SCHOLIUM  The same will obtatin where the Catholick Creditor purchases in the secondary Creditor's Debt upon  A  or conveys his own Debt to the secondary Creditor 'tis true the personal Creditors may here  come to be disappointed but this is not inconsistent see  Schol Prop  I  PROPOSITION IV  But where there is already a secondary Creditor upon the Tenement  A  if the Catholick Creditor chuse to lend a second Sum upon  B  In this Case the proportional Relief will obtain tho' directed against himself  Because otherwise he would be in  mala fide  to lend to the common Debitor since it tends to cut out the Creditor upon  A  who had Reason to trust to a proportional Relief and were this otherwise no Creditor who sees a Catholick Infeftment over two Tenements would be in Safety to lend his Money upon either  PROPOSITION V  Supposing a Catholick Infeftment upon two Tenements and a secondary upon each if the Catholick Creditor purchase in either of the secondary Infeftments he is liable to the proportional Relief The same will obtain if either of the secondary Creditors purchase in the Catholick Infeftment  This is a Consequence of  Prop  IV  PROPOSITION VI  The Catholick Creditor while there is no other Incumbrance upon the two Tenements may renounce his Right upon either of them to the Debitor himself or in Favours of another Creditor lending his Money But after the Existence of the secondary Debt upon  A  he cannot renounce his Right upon the Tenement  B  if he does it can only be in so far as relates to himself  This is plain from  Prop  th and th It will be proper here to obviate a Scruple that arises with Respect to this Proposition Let us put the Argument in the Mouth of a personal Creditor who may urge it as a hard Case the Tenement  B  lying open for him to adjudge whereby he would have the Benefit of a proportional Allocation if the Law should cut him out by suffering the Catholick Creditor to renounce in Favours of the secondary Creditor upon  A  The same says he indeed happens if the Catholick Creditor purchases in the secondary Debt upon  A  or assigns his Right to that secondary Creditor but this must be allowed for the Sake of Commerce that Creditors be not debarr'd from taking Money for their Claims In Answer to this it is allowed that if the Renunciation can be proven the Result of a Contrivance to disappoint the personal Creditors I know not if this might not be understood as collusive and which must always be understood if the Renunciation be after notour Bankruptcy but otherwise Renunciation may be as necessary for Commerce as either of the other two Cases For put the Case the secondary Creditor  upon  A  refuses to trust his Money any longer in the common Debitor's Hands unless he get an additional Security upon  B  or a Renunciation from the Catholick Creditor if the last be chosen as more easily expedited 'tis obvious the personal Creditors have nothing to complain of See what is further said  Schol Prop    st  These four last Propositions are plainly in Principles but there may be some Dispute in the Execution For they suppose that before the Catholick Creditor can renounce the Tenement  A  or lend upon it or purchase in a Debt already contracted he must search the Registers least there be a Debt already contracted upon  B  if he lends or purchases in no Question it is  cum priculo  As for renouncing he may do it safely but the Creditor in whose Favours the Renunciation is made is by no Means in Safety to rely upon it without knowing what Burdens are upon the other Tenements subjected to the Catholick Infeftment Another Inconvenience is That there's no absolute Certainty of coming to the Knowledge what Renunciations have been granted For if even the Declaration of the Catholick Creditor should be thought a sufficient Security tho' that is not always easy to be obtained yet frequently the Debt stands in the Person of a singular or universal Successor To remedy these Inconveniencies it might be proper by an Act of  Sederunt  to appoint  mo  Secondary Creditors when they contract to intimate their Rights to the Catholick Creditor under this Certification That otherwise the Catholick Creditor shall be at Liberty to contract acquire or renounce as if such secondary Debt were not existing  do  To appoint Renunciations to be registred which will give  absolute Security to contract upon Tenements whereupon there is already a preferable Catholick Infeftment We will see from Decisions to be mentioned hereafter how far this is understood to be necessary and how far already fix'd  To conclude this Head it often happens to be doubtful after what Manner this proportional Allocation of the preferable Creditor's Right is to be extricated by Reason of the peculiar Nature thereof or of the Rights of the secondary Creditors To give an Instance  Let us suppose three Adjudgers  sciz  a Catholick Adjudger of both Tenements  do  An Adjudger coming in  pari passu  upon the Tenement  A    tio  An Adjudger without Year and Day upon the Tenement  B  The Difficulty in this Case is That the Catholick Adjudger is not simply preferable to the other two Adjudgers as in the ordinary Cases But it may be reduced to the simplest Case thus Let the Tenement  A  be supposed divided betwixt the two Adjudgers in Proportion to their respective Debts This because they come in  pari passu  Lay aside altogether that Proportion of the Tenement  A  which befalls the Creditor who comes in  pari passu  with the Catholick Adjudger upon that Tenement This pays his Debt  pro tanto  and as for the Remainder it comes in as a secondary Debt upon that Proportion of the Tenement  A  which falls to the Share of the Catholick Creditor The Case then reduced to its simplest Terms stands thus A Catholick Right over a certain Proportion of the Tenement  A  which we shall call  D  and also over the whole Tenement  B  A secondary Right over  B sciz  the Adjudication without Year and Day a secondary Right over  D sciz  the Remainder of  the other Adjudger's Claim over and above what his Share of the Tenement  A  comes to And when the Question is reduced to these Terms the Rules for the proportional Allocation are easily applicable  Let each of the Debts be and each of the Tenements worth In the first Place lay aside as a  praecipuum  to the second Adjudger upon  A  This being done we have a catholick Creditor over the Tenement  D  = and of the Tenement  B  = Out of these two Tenements he ought to draw his Sum proportionally that is out of  D  and out of  B  being to as to after which there remains to the Creditor upon  B  to the Creditor upon  A  So upon the whole the catholick Adjudger draws his the Adjudger coming in  pari passu  with him upon the Tenement  A  draws and the other Adjudger upon  B  only  Let us vary this Case a little and suppose all the three adjudges within Year and Day and let the Numbers be the same save only that the Adjudger upon  B  is only Here striking out the second and third Adjudgers Claims so far as they come in  pari passu  with the catholick Adjudger there will remain two Subjects which remains of  A  which remains of  B  over which the catholick Adjudger is preferable and out which he is to draw his Debt proportionally Which is out of and out of So that the catholick Adjudger draws his whole The Adjudger upon  A  draws  the Adjudger upon  B    Let us now suppose the Legals to be expired and see what Alteration that makes Here the Adjudications that before were Rights in Security limited to the Payment of the Debt secured become  now Rights of Property Thus then in the first of the two Cases the catholick Adjudger now no longer restricted to his Claim of in the Division of the Property with the other Adjudgers claims the Half of the Tenement  A  and the whole Tenement  B  And in the other Case he draws the Half of the Tenement  A  and of the Tenement  B  To give another Instance where the Application of this Rule may seem to be attended with some Difficulty The Case is after an Inhibition the Debitor grants a personal Bond to one and alienates a Parcel of Land to another the Inhibiter attacks the Purchaser Is he bound to assign  in totum  The Difficulty is That here there appears no Place for a proportional Allocation there not being two Funds out of which the Debt secured by Inhibition may be drawn The Answer is That the personal Bond granted after Inhibition must be considered as one Fund at least so much of it as comes to be made effectual against the bankrupt Estate by Adjudication and the Lands disponed as another And therefore that tho' the Inhibiter may assign  in totum  yet the Assigny cannot use it but proportionally against the personal Creditor adjudging But if the Assignation to the Purchaser is supposed prior in Date to the Adjudication upon the personal Bond there the Assignation may be used  in totum per  Corrol Prop IV Simular to this is Diligence by Horning against a Bankrupt which is made use of to found a Reduction upon the Act In this Case the Creditor reducing is bound to assign his Debt and Diligence but then the Assigny cannot extend it against other Alienations made prior to the Assignation otherwise than proportionally  but as to Alienations made after he may extend it  in totum  Let us now touch some of the  Exceptions  where this proportional Relief is denied upon special Circumstances  It will be remembred as laid down in the Beginning of this Essay That the proportional Allocation and Relief obtains when several Persons or several Subjects are bound equally to the same Creditor the Inequality of the Obligation will in all Cases disturb this Rule As for Example where one Person or Thing is bound principally an other only  in subsidium  As to Cases of this Kind take the following Rule  PROPOSITION VII  When two Persons or Subjects are bound unequally the one principally the other  in subsidium  the proportional Allocation cannot obtain But the subsidiary Obligant is intitled to a total Assignation against the Principal and has a total Relief  This naturally follows from the Doctrine above laid down for if an Equality of Obligation infer a proportional Assignation or Relief an Inequality of Obligation must infer a disproportional Assignation or Relief And thus it is founded in the general Principle that Cautioners who have renounced the Benefit of Discussion have yet the Benefit  Cedendarum actionum  And  First  Of the strict Cautionry Obligement the Intendment of which is that the Cautioner shall pay if the Principal be insolvent and  which therefore infers the Benefit of Discussion here it is obvious that there is no proportional Reliet betwixt the Principal and Cautioner After the principal Debitor is discussed the Creditor attacking the Cautioner is bound to assign his Debt and Diligence that the Cautioner may make the best of them Abstracting from the Principles above laid down this is otherwise plain from the following Consideration that as the principal Debitor is liable ultimately for the Debt the Diligence ought to be kept up in order to attack any future Funds accruing to him And since the Creditor is out of the Question by the Cautioner's making Payment the Diligence ought to stand in the Cautioner's Person The Obligation to assign being thus founded in the Nature of the Cautionry Contract it follows that the Creditor may not withhold it upon a Pretext as if no Man were bound to assign against himself For 'tis obvious the principal Debitor is not sufficiently discust so long as the Creditor retains to himself Securities for his separate Debt upon Subjects belonging to the principal Debitor It makes no Objection what was found  l    C Fidejuss  because at the Time of this Law  Fidejussores  had not the  beneficium ordinis aut discussionis  being introduced afterwards by  Justinian  see  Nov    C    In this Matter a Question may arise relating indeed principally to the Nature of an Inhibition Let us suppose a Man lends Money upon a personal Bond and inhibits the Debitor thereafter he lends another Sum to him secured by Infeftment Last of all the Debitor grants a Bond of Corroboration of the personal Debt with a Cautioner When the Cautioner pays without Controversy he has a Right  to the Inhibition Upon this the Question arises Whether the Inhibition assign'd to the Cautioner does strike against the Creditor's heritable Bond Which resolves into a Dispute anent the Nature of an Inhibition whether it be  real  that is directed to the Debt and intended to guard it or only  personal  directed to the Creditor that is in other Words whether Inhibition be a Prohibition to the Debitor to alienate in Prejudice of the  Debt  or in Prejudice of the  Creditor  I incline to the last Upon which Supposition the Inhibition when assign'd will not be available to the Cautioner since it does not strike against Alienations made to the Creditor himself 'Tis a different Case if the Cautionry Obligement was prior to the contracting of the heritable Debt of which hereafter  Let us in the next Place suppose a Cautioner who has renounced the Benefit of Discussion by binding himself  conjunctly and severally  with the Principal And here tho' the Cautioner is  directly  yet not  equally  bound with the Principal Therefore by  Prop  VII as he has a total Relief he ought to have a total Assignation But if once we establish the Obligation upon the Creditor to assign it will follow by  Prop  V That he cannot thereafter contract with the principal Debitor directly or indirectly to disappoint the Cautioner's Relief But there appears nothing to oblige the Creditor to assign against himself to defeat any Right of his own that was prior to the Accession of the Cautioner For since in this Case the Cautioner has not the Benefit of Discussion he has nothing to found his Claim of Assignation upon but the general Laws above laid down and therefore this Case falls to be regulated by  Prop  IV  Possibly it may not be thought an useless Piece of Curiosity to see this made out from other Principles In all Cases it carries strong Conviction when it is found that different Principles coincide in the same Conclusions The Principle of Law that leads me to this Point is as follows That when different Persons are bound to one another in mutual and reciprocal Obligements to a certain End in every Thing they do with Relation to the Contract they are bound to have in View the Support and Accomplishment thereof In other Words the Law considers Persons so bound together as in a  Society  with Relation to their common Affair And it is a Rule in Society that every Member ought to act for the common Behoof Thus a Purchaser of Land buying in a collateral Right cannot pursue a Warrandice against the Seller upon the Footing of Eviction but must restrict his Claim to the Money he paid for the collateral Right which is supposing it to have been bought in with a View to the common Interest Thus a Wadsetter buying in a preferable Title to the Estate is understood to do it for the joint Behoof of himself and Reverser and therefore cannot plead upon it against Redemption of the Lands The same will be found to obtain betwixt a Creditor and a Cautioner who has renounced the Benefit of Discussion For as to the proper Cautioner his Benefit of Discussion as above set forth affords him more ample Security than he has by this Principle To come to Particulars If the Creditor adjudge inhibit or take any other additional Security he is understood as carrying on a  commune negotium  for the Behoof of himself and Cautioners Which infers that he ought to communicate such  additional Security to the Cautioner performing his Part by paying the Debt In which View it must be considered when any additional Security is granted to a Creditor as it is a Security for the Debt itself of consequence it must be a common Security to all who are concerned as Cautioners to see the Debt paid All this proceeds from what is commonly called the  bona fides contractus  And thus it is made out from the Nature of the Contract itself that the Creditor is bound to assign his Debt and Diligence to the Cautioner upon Payment It is a natural Consequence from this that if the Creditor discharge any additional Security it operates Relief  pro tanto  to the Cautioner Which being fix'd Law with us is a Confirmation of this Doctrine For it obviously supposes that the Cautioner has an antecedent Right to demand Assignation without which it would be nothing to the Cautioner whether the Creditor discharge the additional Security or not From the same Principle it follows that a Creditor in a personal Bond with Cautioners using Inhibition against the Debitor and thereafter lending Money to the Debitor upon heritable Security is bound notwithstanding to assign his Inhibition to the Cautioner upon Payment tho' against himself because the Inhibition is a common Security for the Debt both to Principal and Cautioner which Security the Cautioner cannot be defrauded of by any Afterdeed of the Creditors And if a Creditor cannot discharge any additional Security  directly  neither will he be allowed to do it  indirectly  by the Circuit of lending Money to the Debitor It follows  do  That if the Creditor cannot safely lend to the Debitor after  the Date of the additional Security as little can he purchase in  But now let us suppose the heritable Bond prior to the Accession of the Cautioner And let us also suppose it Law that Inhibition does strike against posterior Alienations to the Inhibiter himself In this Case there is nothing in this Principle at least why the Creditor should be obliged to assign at all far less to assign against himself For tho' upon this Principle the Creditor is bound to assign to the Cautioner who has renounced the Benefit of Discussion whatever additional Securities were obtained after the Date of the cautionry Engagement the same will not hold with Respect to anterior Securities because these cannot be regulated by the Laws of Society being before the Society existed  Another EXCEPTION we shall give is of three different Sort of Creditors upon the same Subject  mo  An Annualrenter or Annuitant  do  A Liferent Infeftment of Locality  tio  An Adjudger One would readily think of reducing this to the common Case by considering the Liferent Infeftment as one Subject the Adjudication of the Property as another and the Annualrenter or Annuitant as a preferable Infeftment over both But when the Nature of an Annualrent or Annuity is considered this will be found a wrong Conception of the Matter An Annualrenter or Annuitant ought first to draw his Payment out of the Fruits and it is but by a subsidiary Right that he is entitled to claim the Property itself This is obvious from the Action of poinding the Ground the Stile of which carries the Poinder only to affect the Property  failing  Moveables upon the Ground In this View the  Rents stand as  principal Debitor  the Ground only as  Cautioner  From this Consideration the Liferent Infeftment by Locality ought to be intirely burdened with the Annuity or Annualrent There is no Place therefore for a proportional Allocation and consequently no Foundation for Relief  But what if the Annualrenter or Annuitant suffer the Localist to uplift the whole Rents trusting to his subsidiary Action against the Property This plainly would be acting  arbitrarily  by giving a partial Preference to the Localist And therefore the Adjudger in this Case would be entitled not only to a proportional but to a total Relief against the Localist And further If these preferable Creditors ly out and refuse to intromet I see no Reason why the Adjudger may not be entitled to uplift the Rents in their Name  NB  Here it is taken for granted That as a Localist is a liferent Proprietor she can have on poinding of the Ground for any Inlacks of the Rents more than an absolute Proprietor can and so these Inlacks are not a real Burden upon the Ground as the Inlacks of an Aunuity are All the Remedy she has is to adjudge the Fie upon her Warrandice which will bring her in  pari passu  with other Adjudgers upon personal Rights Let us now suppose that she has adjudged upon her Warrandice but this will make no Difference it will not bring on a proportional Allocation The Annuity or Annualrent continues still a Burden upon the Locality and all the Alteration is that the Localist upon her Warrandice comes in among the other Adjudgers    do  What if the Annuitant or Annualrenter actually assign to the Localist If this was done subsequent to the Date of the Adjudication it will avail nothing see  Proposition  V unless perhaps it be allowed the Force of an Adjudication to bring in the Localist  pari passu  as if she had adjudged upon her Warrandice There is even a Scruple if this Assignation should be sustained though of a Date prior to the Adjudication because it tends to cut out the personal Creditors who rest secure to adjudge  quandocunque  as long as no other Adjudication stands in their Way But this Scruple is already obviated  Schol    Prop  I    tio  If the Annuity and Locality be vested in the same Person before the Existence of any other Right upon the Estate the Possession my be attributed to either to save both This is clear from  Prop  IV And though the Matter should be reckoned doubtful as to a Renunciation which can never be a necessary Deed when granted to a Localist who has not Power like a Creditor to uplift there can be no Dubiety when the Localist purchases the Annuity  e contra  because there is no Reason such Commerce should be discountenanced  This is all to be understood of an Annuity and Locality concurring for the same Years But if there be prior Annuities due before the Commencement of the Liferent Right these cannot be said to be a natural Burden upon every Year's Fruits falling due to the Liferenter as the yearly Annuities are and therefore the Creditors cannot force the Annuitant to draw them out of the Rents As little can they be reckoned a proper Burden upon the Fie considered exclusive of the Liferent but they ought rather to be considered as a catholick Burden and the  Liferent and Fie as two separate Estates subject to them and therefore to be drawn  proportionally  out of each  i e  upon a Sale they are to be paid out of the first End of the Price the Remainder thereof to go to the Localist in Liferent and the Adjudgers in Fie  Another EXCEPTION is as follows Let us suppose the Locality the preferable Right  do  The Infeftment of Annualrent or Annuity  tio  The Adjudger At the same Time let us suppose That the Liferenter consents to the posterior Annualrentright by Virtue of this Consent the Annualrenter will be preferable Has the Localist in this Case a  total  or only a  proportional  Relief against the Adjudger The Answer is She has a  total  Relief because the Consent here is private betwixt the Annualrenter and Localist and can operate nothing in Favours of the Adjudger Besides there is implied in the Consent an Obligation upon the Annualrenter to keep the Localist  indemnis  so far as consistent with his own Interest Therefore what the Annualrenter uplifts in this Case is understood as in Name of the Localist and he takes the Rent not as in Payment of his own Claim but as Money received from the Localist for the Purchase of his Right which therefore he is obliged to assign so far as he receives Thus the Paction is not extended to be a  direct Preference  to the Annualrenter but interpreted to be only an  Obligation  upon the Localist to communicate her Rents to him or which is the same to allow him to uplift in her Name And so it was found  Home    February  Competition Lady  Ludquhairn  with her Husband's Creditors But what if such Consent were  absolutely  conceiv'd  would not this bring it to the former Case as if the Annualrenter were simply preferable  To compleat this Essay it will be proper to look into the Decisions of our Court of Session and to examine how far they have followed or varied from the Principles here laid down They are as follow  An Annualrent being payable out of two Tenements which came afterwards into the Hands of different singular Successors it was found That the Annualrenter might uplift the whole out of any one of the Tenements assigning against the other for Relief  Stair  th  June    Adamson  contra Lord  Balmerino  This is an Example of the first Proposition  A Cautioner upon Payment craving Assignation against his Cocautioner the Lords found the Creditor not obliged to assign the Cautioner being sufficiently secured in Law by his Action for Relief  Newbyth Stair  th  July    Home  contra  Crawfurd  In this Case tho' hard to deny Assignation yet the Dispute perhaps was of little Importance since the Relief that was competent might be as effectual  In a Competition an Adjudger subjected to an Inhibition offering to purge by Payment of the Debt the Creditor was found obliged to assign his Inhibition but not in so far as it might be prejudicial to other Debts in his Person  Stair  th  July    Chiesly  contra  Hay  The like  Stair  th  February    Bruce  contra  Mitchel  These Decisions are defective in so far as they do not mention whether the Inhibiters secondary Debt was of a Date prior or posterior to the Adjudication If prior the Decisions are founded in  Prop  III If posterior the Relief ought to be proportional  per Prop  IV  A Creditor being preferable over two Tenements and a secondary Creditor having a Right only over one  of them in that Situation the preferable Creditor for a separate Debt adjudg'd both Tenements it was found That the Catholick Creditor was not obliged to dispone to the secondary Creditor in Prejudice of his Adjudication existing before the Date of the Process  Stair  th  Nov    Miln  contra  Hay  By this Decision and some others to be mentioned hereafter it seems to be established that the Catholick Creditor is in Safety to lend upon the Tenement  B  before he be interpelled by  Process  at the Instance of the secondary Creditor upon  A  It will undoubtedly be allowed that if he is interpelled by  Intimation  as is above proposed the Effect would be the same By these Decisions then we may reckon it as established that Intimation is necessary to interpel the catholick Creditor without which he may safely lend upon the Tenement  B  though in Prejudice of the secondary Creditor upon  A  and this in some Measure supersedes the Necessity of making an Act of  Sederunt  to that Effect  It may further be remarked upon this Decision That if the Bond upon which Adjudication past was prior in Date to the Notification of the secondary Creditor's Infeftment upon that Supposition the catholick Creditor was not at all bound to assign  Argum Prop  III because though he might be  in mala fide  to lend upon  B  after he knew of another Debt upon  A  yet not to adjudge upon a prior Debt that being  necessitatis  not  voluntatis  Similar is the Case observed by  Fountainhall    d January    Scotland  contra  Bairdner  where in a Competition betwixt a Liferentrix who only had her Liferent upliftable out of the half of the Subject and a Creditor whose Infeftment affected  the whole and was prior to that of the Liferentrix and who had also an Adjudication but posterior to the Liferent Right she craving that he might be decerned to assign her as to one half in regard the other was sufficient to pay him his Annualrent The Lords thought that if he acquired any such Adjudication less preferable  post litem motam  he might be reputed  in mala fide  to make Use of such Right to impede his assigning to the Liferentrix but if he had got it before then there was no Law hindring him to do the same and to cover it by his better Right and so the Lords refused to decern him to assign the Liferentrix against the other half in Prejudice of his Adjudication Here again the Necessity of Intimation is enforced  An Assignation to some Goods by a Bankrupt to his Creditor in Security and Payment being reduced upon the Act by another Creditor and the Reducer at the same Time arresting in the Assigney's Hands and pursuing a Forthcoming the Assigney was contented to make the Goods forthcoming but craved Assignation from the Pursuer to his cumulative Security by Adjudication in so far as he should pay that so he might operate his Relief out of the common Debitor's Effects  pro tanto  The Lords found this relevant and ordained the Pursuer to assign but with this express Quality That the Pursuer should be preferred  quoad  his Debt and the Assigney should not compete with him for the same  Fountainhall Forbes    December    Reid  contra  Man  This Decision is certainly well founded There can be no Pretence for obliging a catholick Creditor who gets Payment only of a Part of his catholick Debt to assign in Proportion to that Payment which may tend in some Measure to restrict  his Claim for the Remainder 'Tis fair in such a Case if he assign at any Rate  A Creditor by Bond wherein three Persons were bound as Coprincipals being the first Arrester of a Subject belonging to one of his Debitors was not found obliged to assign his Bond to the other Arresters for recovering of the other two Coprincipals the Superplus paid to him out of the common Debitor's Effects more than his third Share altho' Relief of two Thirds was competent to the common Debitor himself against these Coprincipals For this Reason That the Creditors postponed might affect the said Relief by Diligences  Forbes    February    Kennedy  contra  Vans  and  Crawford  This Decision is one of very few that are not easie to be adjusted to Principles running contrary to the primary Law of a proportional Allocation It appears obvious That the  ratio decidendi  which may possibly be the Observer's is by no Means conclusive For if Assignation is never to be granted where the Creditor craving Assignation has otherwise Action competent against the Person or Subject it will follow that Assignations should never be granted in any Case At that Rate in the known Case of a catholick Right over two Tenements belonging to the same common Debitor and a secondary Right over one of them the secondary Creditor could not seek Assignation against the other Tenement because he might affect it by Diligence And it is remarkable That the Decisions as handed down to us run so cross to one another that sometimes it has been sustained as a good Reason for denying Assignation that the Subject designed to be affected in vertue of the Assignation did not belong to the common Debitor  and consequently was not otherwise to be come at but thro' Aid of the Assignation See below  Forbes    June    Ker  contra Creditors of  Harden  But now what if another Creditor of the common Debitor's has  ab ante  affected this Relief The Answer is That it will signifie nothing For let us make a Supposition which is exceeding rational That the catholick Creditor had drawn his Payment equally from the three Coobligants upon that Supposition as there would be no Foundation for Relief the Creditor who had affected it could draw nothing It can make no Difference that the catholick Creditor chuses to draw his Whole from one The very Design of an Assignation is to remedy this Inequality and to put all Things upon the same Footing as if he had drawn  equally  and  proportionally  which every catholick Creditor is supposed to do when the Question is anent Relief competent to secondary Creditors among themselves  A Party having two Infeftments of Annualrent one prior and another posterior to the Infeftment of another Creditor whose Infeftment was only of a Part of the Lands he who had the first and third being infeft in the whole and taking up his Annualrent out of that Part only wherein the other stood infeft whereby that other was disappointed and therefore craved in a Process to be assigned to a Proportion c The Lords found That where a posterior Creditor pays a prior out of his own Money he has a Title to demand Assignation but if he leaves him to get his Payment out of the Debitors Means the catholick Creditor is not obliged to assign but with a Quality and Reservation that it shall not prejudice his other Debts and Rights tho' posterior to the Party's Right who craves the Assignation  Fountainhall Forbes    December    Pitcairn  contra  Halliday  This is directly opposite to Proposition IV unless it be said that there is here no Appearance that the catholick Creditor was acquainted with the interjected Creditor's Debt If this be understood as the  ratio decidendi  it tends to fortifie the Doctrine above laid down anent the the Necessity of Intimation  Brigadier  Preston  Purchaser of the Estate of  Valleyfield  at a publick Roup offered to the Lords a Scheme for drawing the Price wherein it appeared that he had Right to some Debts preferable over the whole Estate and to others preferable over particular Parcels And pretending to exhaust the remanent Price of the separate Parcels affected by his catholick Debts in order to bring in the other Debts purchased in by him preferable as said is upon particular Parcels This was opposed by Colonel  Erskine  who alledged that the catholick Debts preferable upon the whole Estate ought to be taken out of the whole Head of the Price whereby the Price of every particular Parcel of the Estate would be diminished proportionally and he the Colonel of Consequence would draw some Share of the remanent Price whereas by the Brigadier's Scheme he was intirely excluded The Lords found the Brigadier might exhaust the Price of any Part of the Estate by his sovereign Rights affecting the whole and that he might make the best Use he could of his Rights providing the same were not  acquired  or made use of  in emulationem  of the Colonel  Bruce    February  Brigadier  Preston  contra Colonel  Erskine  Here the Fact is not distinctly laid down whether the Purchases made by the Brigadier of his secondary Rights were prior or posterior to  the Existence of those belonging to the Colonel If prior the Decision is agreeable to the Corrollary of Prop III otherwise if posterior unless it be put upon the Footing that Colonel  Erskine  gave no Intimation to the Brigadier of the Existence of his Rights And the Provision at the Close of the Interlocutor shews plain enough the Opinion of the Court as to this Matter For after such Intimation any secondary Rights purchased in by the Brigadier who was catholick Creditor must undoubtedly be deemed  to be acquired and made use of  in emulationem  of the Colonel  A Creditor ranked in the second Place did after the Ranking purchase in the preferable Debt and having these two Rights in his Person he became Purchaser of the Estate at a publick Sale and gave Bond for the Price payable to his Creditors as they were ranked The preferable Debt purchas'd in by him as said is did not only reach over the Lands purchas'd by him at the publick Roup but also over a separate Subject belonging to another The Fact was That the Price of the Lands sold publickly was but sufficient to answer the preferable Right and therefore the Purchaser willing to bring his secondary Claim within the Price craved Payment of his preferable Right intirely out of the separate Subject which the Lords refused and found That the said Debt being in the Person of the Purchaser of the Lands upon which it was ranked  primo loco  which Purchaser granted Bond for Payment of the Price to the Creditors as ranked the said Debt became  eo ipso  extinguished  confusione  and could not revive to be a Charge upon the separate Subject th  June  Competition betwixt Mr  Henry Ramsay  and the  Bank of  SCOTLAND In this Case  it is clearly laid down that after Intimation by Process of a secondary Right the proportional Relief will obtain tho' the preferable and any other secondary Right should come into the same Person When the Matter is brought here it will follow that any legal Intimation is sufficient For it would be ridiculous to impose the Necessity of raising a Process when there is nothing else in view but to intimate a Fact to the Defender Thus then we may hold it as an established Point in our Practice that the Catholickcreditor may renounce his Right upon the Tenement  A  lend a second Debt upon that Tenement or purchase in a Debt upon it at any Time without being oblig'd to search the Registers until actual Intimation be made to him of a secondary Right upon the Tenement  B  Robert Scot  serv'd Heir in general and confirm'd Executor  qua  nearest of Kin to Sir  William Scot  of  Harden  conveyed all Subjects heritable and moveable that he had Right to by these Titles to  Ker  of  Chatto  Some of Sir  William  's real Creditors infeft in his Land Estate having also affected by Diligence their Debitors other Effects conveyed as said is to  Ker  of  Chatto  were in a Competition preferred to the Disponee  Ker  thus excluded by the preferable Creditors demanded Assignation to their Debts and Diligence in order to affect the real Estate It was answered for the Creditors That no Person is intitled to demand Assignation unless against his own Debitors Effects The Lords found That in so far as Sir  William Scot  's Creditors are either paid out of his Estate or out of his other Effects they are not bound to assign their Debts and Diligences in Favours of  Chatto Forbes    June    Scot  contra  Ker  That this Decision is reconcileable  with the Principles above laid down I see not unless we take a separate Circumstance into Consideration tho' not at all laid hold upon by the Collector Sir  William Scot  had tailied his Land Estate with strict prohibitory and irritant clauses Now tho' this could not save the Estate from his own Debts yet it may infer a very natural Presumption That Sir  William  intended his separate Funds should go in the first Place for Payment of his Debts If this be well founded the Decision is extreamly justifiable for the separate Funds to which  Robert Scot  succeeded upon his Confirmation and general Service have been considered as the principal Debitor and the tailied Estate as Cautioner only and therefore in this View it had been wrong done by the Creditors to assign against the tailied Estate had they been ever so willing  In the Year  M'Guffoc  of  Rusco  Heritor of the Lands of  Borgue  granted an heritable Bond for the Sum of  lib  out of the said Lands in Favours of  Irving  of  Logan  whereupon the Creditor was infeft the same Year Thereafter the said  Rusco  granted a Disposition of the Lands of  Borgue  in Favours of his second Son  David Blair  reserving a Faculty to alter but which Faculty he afterwards renounced in his Son's Contract of Marriage  M'Guffoc  of  Rusco  being overcharged with Debt in the his Estate was brought to a Sale and the said  Irving  of  Logan  who had adjudged all his Debitor's Lands for the above mentioned Debt of  lib  was ranked as a preferable Creditor And upon his drawing Payment it was demanded by the  other Creditors that he should assign them to his Infeftment upon the Lands of  Borgue  according to the general Rule in these Cases that who has a preferable Infeftment in two different Subjects for the same Debt if he chuse to draw his whole Claim out of one is obliged to assign to the Creditors postponed to afford them a proportional Relief out of the other Subject This was opposed by the Relict and Children of  Borgue  upon this  medium  That by  Rusco  's Disposition to his second Son and Afterconsent in that Son's Contract of Marriage he became bound to warrant the said Lands the Consequence whereof is that had  Irving  of  Logan  drawn his whole Sum out of their Lands they must have been intitled to demand Assignation against  Rusco  bound to them in Warrandice just as much as a Creditor who takes Payment from a Cautioner is obliged to assign him against the principal Debitor Answer'd  Rusco  was never bound to warrand his Son  David  and his Heirs against  Logan  's Debt The Disposition was under a reserv'd Faculty to contract Debt alter and dispose of the Estate c and consequently the Debt already contracted could be no Contravention of the Warrandice and supposing the Son had paid the Debt he could never have distressed his Father for the same and consequently an Assignation would have been fruitless and ineffectual Nor does the Father's Afterconsent in his Son's Contract of Marriage which implied a Renunciation of his Faculty any way alter the Case For by no Interpretation can this be drawn to import an Obligation upon the Father to warrand or relieve his  Son of the foresaid Debt The Lords refused the Assignation  January  Competition betwixt the Creditors of  Rusco  and the Relict and Children of  Blair  of  Borgue  This Decision runs directly counter to the Principle of a proportional Allocation There may occur some Difficulty in adjusting the real Relief in this Case which will be solv'd by comparing this Case with that abovementioned of a Catholick Adjudger of two Tenements Another Adjudger within Year and Day upon the Tenement  A  a third without Year and Day upon the Tenement  B  Here the Lands of  Borgue  stand for the Tenement  B  and  David Blair  Proprietor thereof for the Adjudger without Year and Day  Mrs  Dalgleish  Creditor to Earl of  Roseberry  arrested the Rents of his Estate in the Tenants Hands as also a personal Bond of his in the Hands of Mr  John Alves  the Debitor Thereafter the same Rents were arrested by  Blair  another Creditor who by Decreet of Furthcoming was preferred  secundo loco  on that Subject Last of all the common Debitor granted Assignation of Mr  John Alves  's Bond for onerous Causes to  Archibald Robertson  Merchant in  Edinburgh  This Assignation obliged the Debitor in the Bond to raise a Multiplypoinding wherein the Arrester was preferred to the Assigney This gave Occasion to  Robertson  the Assigney whose Subject was thus carried away by the Arrester to demand an Assignation to the Arrester's Debt and Diligence in order to operate his Relief out of the other Subject affected thereby  sciz  the Rents of the Estate in the Tenants Hands Against that Demand  Blair  the second Arrester of that Subject appeared for his Interest It was pled for him That the common  Debitor could not put the Arrester in a worse Situation by granting Assignation to  Robertson  And therefore that he is intitled to a total Assignation as if the Assignation had not been granted It was answered That the common Debitor remained Fiar of the Bond just as much after  Blair  's Arrestment as before the Arrestment not affecting the Bond and therefore his Assignation to  Robertson  was valid and effectual in Law and did infer an Obligation upon the Catholickcreditor chusing to draw his Payment out of a Fund that now no longer belonged to his Debitor to assign for a total Relief which Obligation was infer'd from the Principles of Remuneration To this it was replied by the second Arrester That the Bond being affected by the preferable Arrestment was made litigious and therefore was still to be considered as remaining in the Person of the common Debitor The Lords found that Mistress  Dalgleish  was not obliged to assign to the Assigney  Robertson  in Prejudice of  Blair  's Arrestment th  June  Competition betwixt  Robertson  and  Blair  This is directly opposite to  Prop  II But it is to be observ'd that here  Robertson  was insisting for a total Assignation Possibly had he restricted his Claim to a proportional Assignation he would have had a more favourable Hearing  George Gordon  lent Merks upon Bond conjunctly and severally to  Kincaid  and  Suttie Kincaid  got the Money and gave  Suttie  a Bond of Relief Upon this Bond after the Term of Payment Diligence was done by Horning and Inhibition Thereafter  Kincaid Suttie  and  Johnston  conjunctly and severally granted Bond of Corroboration containing a Clause obliging the other two to relieve  Johnston  as their Cautioner  Johnston  after this and after Existence of the Inhibition lent  Kincaid  the common Debitor  lib Sterl  by an heritable Bond Last of all the said  Johnston  paid the Debt wherein he was Cautioner and took from  George Gordon  the Creditor Assignation to the Debt and Diligence and insisted against  Suttie  for Relief In this Process the Question occur'd Whether  Johnston  was bound to assign the Inhibition to  Suttie  upon Payment  Johnston  pled That the Inhibition strikeing against his heritable Bond the Law did not oblige him to assign against himself  Suttie  contended That this Rule holds not betwixt Cautioners who seeking Relief off one another are bound in strict Law from the Nature of the Contract to assign The Lords found no Necessity upon  Johnston  to assign the Inhibition th  November    Johnston  contra  Suttie  To examine this Case by the Laws above laid down we shall in the first Place take up the Question as if  George Gordon  the Creditor in the Bond with Inhibition had also been the Lender of the posterior heritable Bond and as  Johnston  were not in the Field In this Case according to the plainest Principles  Suttie  paying the Debt would be intitled to demand Assignation to the Inhibition tho' exclusive of the heritable Bond See  Page  'Tis another Question how far the Inhibition would in this Case be serviceable when assigned but this comes not in in a Case like the present where the heritable Bond was granted to another than the Inhibiter Continuing still the Supposition That  Gordon  was Creditor in both Bonds let us draw a little nearer to the present Case by taking in the Consideration of the Bond of Corroboration wherein  Johnston  acceded as Cautioner  Here  Johnston  paying the Debt would have Right to demand Assignation to the Inhibition And when he is seeking Relief off  Suttie  'tis as evident he must transfer the Debt and Diligence to him in order to operate his Relief against the principal Debitor For if he acts as Creditor the Thing is apparent if as Cautioner upon the Clause in the Bond of Corroboration it will come to the same For if a Creditor be bound to assign upon Payment  multo magis  a Cocautioner who has a Bond of Relief To come close to the Case in Hand if  Gordon  was bound to assign to  Suttie  even against himself tho' he had been Lender of the heritable Bond he cannot put him in a worse Situation by choosing to take his Debt from  Johnston  And  Johnston  who comes in  Gordon  's Place by the Assignation cannot be in a better Situation than  Gordon  himself would be had he been the Lender of the heritable Bond To take this Matter in the nearest View  Gordon  's Inhibition became an additional Security for the Debt for the Benefit of himself and all the Cautioners Therefore whichever Cautioner was burdened with the Debt had a Right to the Inhibition in order to operate his Relief against the principal Debitor and thereupon was intitled to reduce every Deed posterior to the Inhibition in whoseever Favours granted  Vinco Vincentem  _IN the Essay upon the  Beneficium cedendendarum actionum  we have endeavoured to lay down after what Manner Creditors catholick and secondary are to draw their Payment from the several Persons and out of the several Subjects burdened with their Debts The Design of this Essay is to lay down some Rules for extricating the Preferences of Creditors and Disponees competing upon the same Subject In the first Essay the Question is Having given the Order of Preference to determine the Method of drawing Payment out of the different Funds and from the different Persons liable in the Debts In this the Question is Having given the Fund to determine the absolute and partial Preferences and what each Competitor shall draw  For Method's Sake we shall first take under Consideration the Competition of Creditors among themselves These stand  limited  and  restricted  according to the Extent of their Claims After discussing which the Competition among Disponees c fall in whose Claims upon the Subject contraverted are from their Nature unlimited and totally exclusive of others  In the Preferences that arise simply from Priority of Time there can arise no Dubiety among competing Creditors  Potior tempore potior jure  is a Rule upon which Preferences may be as easily determin'd as it is to determine that this Year this Hour this Day is posterior to the last The Difficulties that arise proceed from partial Grounds of Preference that one Creditor obtains against another whereby it happens that he who is posterior in Time shall sometimes exclude and be preferred to one or another that is prior To give an Example Suppose three Annualrenters  A B C  all in Order of Time suppose at the same Time  A  consenting to  C  's Preference In this Case  A  is preferable to  B B  to  C  and  C  again to  A A  to  B  and  B  to  C  by Priority of Time and  C  to  A  by the Consent In Cases of this Nature if the Debts exceed the Fund it will be found no easy Matter to adjust what every Creditor should draw  Before we come to the Point it will be necessary to consider the Force and Effect of the Consent that the last Creditor has obtained from the first This Consent must be considered in one of two Views  mo  As giving the Right consented to all the Benefit of the Consenter's Diligence that is interpreting the Consent as a  virtual Assignation  Or  do  As giving it only a  Preference  so as to intitle the Creditor consented to to draw as if the Consenter were not in the Field This last is the true Meaning of the Consent and all the Force that the Law allows it and which indeed is the only View in which the Matter can be attended with any Difficulty For if the Consent be understood as a  virtual Assignation  there can be no Collision betwixt the first and last Creditor the Rule  prior tempore potior jure  will be sufficient to extricate the whole  Taking then the Consent as a  Preference  not a  virtual Assignation  the Method that naturally casts up to adjust these Preferences appears to be this Let the Creditors be ranked upon the Subject according to their  real  Preferences  A  in the first Place  B  in the second  C  in the last These are the Places that naturally belong to them in virtue of their Diligences This Step being taken it falls next to be considered what  partial  Grounds of Preference any Creditor has against another In this Case the only partial Ground is the Consent whereby  C  is intitled to draw as if  A  were not in the Field To adjust this Preference let us suppose the Fund and each of the Debts in adjusting the  real  Ranking  A  draws  B    C  nothing  B  keeps his this he is intitled to by the  real  Ranking not being concerned with the  partial  Preference that occurs only when the Question is betwixt the other two Creditors Let us next consider the Effect of this  partial  Preference which intitles  C  to draw as if  A  were not in the Field When this Calculation is made  C  will be found intitled to draw only so that upon the whole  B  draws  C  and  A    This appears to be the natural Method for adjusting Preferences among Creditors who have personal Challenges or partial Grounds of Preference against one another To clear the Matter still further it will be proper to obviate what Objections may arise According to this Method it is obvious that  A  the Consenter is in a better Situation than if  B  were not in the Field This may appear strange It may be thought when  C  is claiming the Benefit of  A  's Consent that he ought to draw the whole seeing it is  jus tertii  for  A  to plead upon the Right of  B  which he does when  C  is restricted to draw only As this indeed seems to have the Air of an Objection a solid Answer may tend strongly to inforce this Scheme To obtain perfect Satisfaction we need but look into the Circumstances of the Parties and Nature of the Transaction  C  about to lend his Money sees two real Creditors upon the Subject He is unwilling to lend upon that Security unless he obtain  A  's Consent to his Preference He sees at the same Time  B  preferable but that he takes his Hazard of he is willing to lend under that Disadvantage All therefore he can pretend to draw even after  A  's Consent is what remains of the Fund unpreoccupied by  B  This is all the real Security he has to depend upon and all he ought to draw in the Division of the Fund or Price thereof When therefore in the Question betwixt  C  and  A  upon the Consent  B  's Right is brought under Consideration it must not be taken in this Light as if  A  were founding any Preference upon it it is pled upon only to determine how far the Consent should operate The Law says That such a Consent is not a  virtual  Assignation it means no more but to allow the Creditor consented to to draw as if the Consenter were not in the Field To make this Calculation it is plain that  B  's Interest must be taken into Consideration And therefore according to the Example above laid down when  C  draws all the Fund that remains unpreoccupied by  B  he draws the whole that was intended him by the Consent This Argument is drawn from the Meaning of the Consent and it is solid However it will be necessary  to give another Answer sufficient to reach all the Cases of partial Preferences as well as that by Consent And this will arise from considering the Nature of the Objection  jus tertii  In the Essay upon that Subject it is laid down  Position  VI That one is ever allowed to found upon the Right of a third Party when the Conclusion tends to restrict or annul the Right of his Antagonist Thus substituting an Inhibition in Place of the Consent when the third Creditor Inhibiter comes to claim his Preference he draws just as the Right consented to did because all that the Inhibition or Consent can operate is to strike out  A  And when that is done all that remains to them unpreoccupied by  B  is And tho'  B  himself draws but in Competition with  A  yet  A  can found upon  B  's Right to restrict  C  to since it is not claiming a Preference upon  B  's Right but using it as an Argument to restrict  C  's Right And truly the Argument is conclusive Were  C  allowed to cut out  A  of his whole Claim without suffering any Restriction upon Account of  B  's Claim it would follow that an Inhibition which is only understood a Ground of  Preference  must really and substantially be a  virtual Assignation  so as to put the Inhibiter in the inhibited Person's Place and to intitle him to draw not only in his own Right but in Right of the Person inhibited which is directly contrary to the Nature of an Inhibition  It may possibly be urged further upon this Point Why should it not be reckoned  jus tertii  for  A  to found upon  B  's Right in order to restrict  C  as well as it is for  C  to found upon  A  's Right in order to restrict  B  Now it  C  could found upon  A  's Right in order to restrict  B  the Scheme would come out  thus By Means of the Restriction  B  drawing but two there would remain four unpreoccupied to be drawn by  C  In Answer to this let it be considered that the  jus tertii  cannot lie both Ways If it be  jus tertii  for  C  to build upon  A  's Right in order to restrict  B  it cannot be  jus tertii  for  A  to found upon  B  's Right in order to restrict  C  these being directly contradictory Positions the one terminating in a virtual Conveyance the other only in a Preference which is the true Conception of the Matter But more directly the Difference comes precisely here  A  as above laid down may found upon  B  's Interest to cut down  C  why Because the necessary Consequence is to prefer himself or which is the same to relieve himself of a Burden But to what Purpose is it that  C  would found upon  A  's Interest 'Tis true  A  is preferable to  B  but no Conclusion can be drawn from that to  C  's Advantage it neither tends to profit  C  or to relieve him of any Burden Thus in Competition with  A B  can only draw two but it will not follow that four remains for  C  because 'is perfectly consistent that  B  draw four in Competition with  C  though he draw only two in Competition with  A  I have chosen the partial Preference that arises from Consent as the plainest and simplest Case to illustrate and clear this Subject But what is laid down here will apply to all the other Grounds of partial Preference Inhibitions  pari passu  Adjudications c All of which operate a  Preference  not a  virtual Assignation  The Rule then comes out thus first to rank all the Creditors according to the Priority of their Diligences without respecting the partial Grounds of Preference any one may have against another By  this first Operation will be ascertained the Claims of these Creditors who stand free of Challenge In the next Place to adjust what will fall to any Creditor in Virtue of partial Grounds of Preference the Operation must go thus Strike out the Creditor against whom the partial Ground of Preference is directed what remains of the Fund unpreoccupied by the other Creditors not struck at belongs to the Creditor Obtainer of the partial Preference  It need hardly be qualified here that for what is drawn from the first Creditor  A  by Virtue of the Consent or Inhibition he cannot recur against  B  that would carry this Absurdity to make the Inhibition or Consent virtually operate against  B  tho' intended only against  A B  's Annualrent second in the Order of Time entitles him to take up the second Place this is his Situation let  A  and  C  adjust their Preferences in the best Shape they can If  C  thurst out  A  that entitles not  A  to thurst out  B  He must be satisfied to take up  C  's Place But it is proper to be observed That it will make no Difference as to this Scheme whether the partial Ground of Challenge be considered as operating a direct Preference or only a personal Claim or Ground of Reduction For taking the Matter in either Shape the Creditor who has the Ground of Challenge must still be entitled to draw as if the Debt against which the Challenge lies were not in the Field This Observation supersedes intirely the Necessity as to this Point of disputing whether an Inhibition give a direct Preference or be only a Ground of Reduction Which possibly may be a Question not easily determined from the Nature of that Diligence  Let us illustrate this Doctrine by another Example The first we shall give is out of the  Roman  Law The  species facti  is this a Person borrows Money and for Security gives a Hypotheck which the Creditor neglects to registrate Thereafter the Debitor becomes a Tutor whereby by the  Roman  Law his whole Goods become hypothecated to the Pupil Last of all he borrows another Sum and gives another conventional Hypotheck which the Creditor registrates What gives Occasion to the Difficulty here is a Constitution whereby conventional Hypothecks registred are preferred to these not registred Whence the unregistred Hypotheck is preferred to the Legal and the Legal to the Registred by Priorty of Time For a legal Hypotheck need not be registred the registred Hypotheck again is preferred to the unregistred Let us as before suppose each of the Debts = the Fund = To extricate this let us first adjust the real Ranking By this Ranking the legal Hypotheck draws not being concerned with the Ground of Challenge that the one conventional Hypotheck has against the other All that the registred Hypotheck can draw supposing the unregistred out of the Field is barely The other remaining is left to the unregistred Hypotheck This Scheme of Ranking falls in precisely with the one abovementioned And so it ought because the registring of  C  's Hypotheck has the same Effect with his Inhibition against  A  or  A  's Consent to his Preference  Thus the Matter comes out where the partial Grounds of Challenge operate a total Preference The Cases fall next to be considered where these partial Grounds operate only a  pari passu  Preference or such like which is the Case of Adjudications within Year and Day As for Example we shall suppose  A  to be an Adjudger infeft  B  an Annualrenter  C  a second Adjudger  pari passu  with the first In this Case it is plain all the second Adjudger has to depend upon is what remains of the Fund after satisfying the Annualrenter and that Remainder too he must lay his Account to share with all prior Adjudgers and posterior within Year and Day He can be in no better Situation than if  A  the first Adjudger were posterior to the Annualrenter or even were the last Adjudger but within Year and Day Whence it follows That  C  the second Adjudger in this Case can draw but half of the free Fund that remains unpreoccupied by  B  the Annualrenter This Case is also reducible to the former by taking it in this Light  A  the first Adjudger is preferable to  B  the Annualrenter and  B  the Annualrenter to  C  the second Adjudger by Priority of Diligence  C  the second Adjudger is preferable to  A  the first Adjudger by the Act not totally indeed but for the one Half And accordingly he draws that Half as if  A  the first Ajudger were not in the Field To illustrate this by an Example let us as formerly suppose the Fund = each of the Debts = then  A  draws in Competition with  B  To  B  there remains which he retains in all Events To  C  again there remains but unprooccupied by  B  which at the same Time he must communicate with  A  upon Account of the  pari passu  Preference So upon the whole  A  draws  B    C    In this View of the Matter it is taken for granted That the Act of Parliament bringing in Ajudgers  pari passu  does not give the second Adjudger all Advantages as if his Diligence were truly of the same Date with the first Adjudgers such Favour was surely not designed All intended by the  Act to cut off that Preference which first Adjudgers naturally have by Priority of Diligence so that it levels the first Adjudger's Preference in Competition with a second but gives no Privilege to a second Adjudger in Competition with third Parties  Having laid down the Rule and Method for determining the Preferences among compeating Creditors it will be proper in the next Place to add some other Examples to these above set forth  A  an Annualrenter consenting to  C  's Preference  B  an Adjudger inhibiting before the Contraction of  C  's Debt  C  an Adjudger  pari passu  subject to  B  's Inhibition and preferable to  A  by the Consent  Let us continue to suppose the Fund = each of the Debts =  In adjusting the  real  Preferences which fall first under Consideration  A  draws and the two Adjudgers  pari passu  each of them draws Next as to the  partial Grounds  of Preference  B  the Adjudger Inhibiter cutting out  C  by Virtue of his Inhibition must draw as he were not in the Field and so takes which is his ultimate Draught  C  again must draw as  A  were not in the Field which entitles him to no more but being cut out of the other by the inhibiting Adjudger These  C  draws from  A  and consequently upon the ultimate Division  A  draws  B  and  C    Let us again suppose each of the Debts = the Fund continuing = In this Case  A  will draw  B  and  C    Let now each of the Debts be = the Fund continuing = In this Case  A  will draw the whole  Another Example may be drawn from  l    Qui potior in Pign  A Debitor hypothecates his Fund first to  A  next to  B  in the last Place to  C  In a Competition betwixt  A  and  C C  is unjustly preferred but against this unjust Sentence there is no Appeal entred  C  is also preferred to  B  but upon an Appeal  B  obtains Redress In this Case it is demanded how the Preferences are to be adjusted  A  is preferable to  B  and  B  to  C  by Priority of Time  C  again to  A  by the Sentence not appealed against This Case comes to be the same with that of three Annualrenters abovementioned whereof the last has an Inhibition against the first  Another Example may be given which deserves well to be considered  mo  An Assignation intimate  do  An Arrestment interveening betwixt the Assignation and Intimation  tio  An Adjudication whereof the Citation was prior to the Arrestment but posterior to the Date of the Assignation The Subject is the Rent of Lands and the Parties all called together in a Multiplepoinding Here the Arrestment is preferable to the Assignation  Stair T Assignation  § The Assignation is preferable to the Adjudication by Priority of Diligence  Durie    d March    Smith  contra  Hepburn  And the Adjudication again to the Arrestment upon the same Account  Forbes    June    Steuart  contra  Steuart  How is this Matter to be extricated Here is a plain direct Circle of  absolute real  Preferences founded all upon the same Medium which appears to be a plain direct Inconsistence For it comes to the same as if  A  should be made preferable to  B  upon any one Medium and  B  again preferable to  A  upon the same Medium In all the Circles that have hitherto cast up different  Media  of  Preference are brought in to make the Circle Thus it may readily be that  A  is preferable to  B B  to  C  upon one Medium and  C  again to  A  upon another Medium or more shortly that  A  is preferable to  B  upon one Medium and  B  to  A  upon another As for Example In two Infeftments of Annualrent whereof the last has an Inhibition that strikes against the first  A  is preferable to  B  by Priority of Time and  B  again to  A  by his Inhibition But 'tis inconsistent that two Diligences can be mutually preferable upon the same Medium which would in  er this Absurdity That from the same Medium two opposite or inconsistent Conclusions might be drawn In this Case the same Medium of Preference regulates the whole Competition  sciz  the Priority of Attachment or  Nexus realis  upon the Subject Were this Medium carried steadily through in comparing these Diligences with one another it is impossible there could be any Difficulty The Matter becomes inextricable by this alone that in the Competition betwixt the Assigney and Arrester the Arrestment is supposed to make a  Nexus realis  upon the Subject whereas in Competition with the Adjudger the Arrestment is supposed only to be a  personal Prohibition  to the Debitor and consequently no  Nexus realis  No Wonder then that two inconsistent Suppositions in the same Competition should bring on an inextricable Circle To evade this if it be alledged That an Arrestment is preferable interveening betwixt the Assignation and Intimation upon a Presumption of Collusion betwixt the Debitor and Assigney antedating the Assignation in Order to disappoint the Arrester The Answer is ready  mo  There is no Ground in Law to infer such a Collusion with Respect to a formal Right solemnly  executed before Witnesses granted for an onerous Cause  do  Any such Presumption of Collusion must necessarily operate in Favours of the Adjudger as well as of the Arrester which yet was never pretended The Matter therefore must necessarily come out in this Shape either that Arrestment makes a  nexus realis  upon which Supposition it must be preferable in the present Case both to Assigney and Adjudger or that it makes only a  personal Prohibition  upon which Supposition both Assigney and Adjudger must be preferable to it That the last Supposition is the Truth of the Matter will appear  mo  From the Nature and Stile of the Diligence  do  From this indisputable Position That Arrestment stops not a posterior Poinding  tio  From what is above laid down that a posterior Adjudication is preferable to an Arrestment  SECT II Of the Competition among Disponees c  The Rules above laid down will apply equally to the Case of Disponees as to that of Creditors There is no other Variety in the Cases but that of  limited  and  unlimited  And even Creditors come frequently to have unlimited Claims which happen so oft as the Debt is equal to or exceeds the Value of the Subject In which Circumstances they come to be precisely upon the same Footing with Disponees In Competition among Disponees c real Preferences and personal Grounds of Challenge cast up the same Way as among Creditors And the Rule must equally obtain in both that the personal Ground of Challenge is frequently cut  down for Want of an Interest to plead it so that  jus tertii  does equally regulate both Cases  To shew this Connection by an Example let us suppose three Annualrenters of which the last has an Inhibition against the first Let the Fund be = and each of Debts = Upon this Supposition the Creditors will draw a Piece But again let each of the Debts be = and upon this Supposition the first Annualrenter will draw the Whole notwithstanding that the last Annualrenter is preferable to him by vertue of his Inhibition Which in this Case it is  jus tertii  for the last Annualrenter to insist upon the Fund as to him being intirely preocupied by the second Annualrenter so that tho' the third Annualrenter should prevail in his personal Challenge against the first it would avail him nothing  Instead of Annualrenters let us now substitute Disponees and it is obvious the Resolution must be the same The last Disposition tho' supported by an Inhibition that strikes against the first cannot prevail The  jus tertii  lies against him in respect he can have no Benefit by the Challenge the Fund being already preoccupied by the second Disposition  It is then the  jus tertii  that equally regulates both Cases which allows the personal Challenge to go no further than the Challenger can shew a Benefit thereby It will readily occur That among Disponees this Bar of  jus tertii  generally excludes the personal Challenge totally the Fund being supposed already preoccupied by some third Right against which the Challenge lies not Among Creditors it is generally otherwise For the third Right against which the Challenge lies not being limited  and for the most Part not absorbing the whole Fund this of consequence allows the personal Challenge a  partial  Effect as may be seen in all the Examples above given among Creditors unless where the Debt of the interjected Creditor has been equal to the Value of the Fund And this is the only Variety that does occur in Application of the above Rules to the Case of compeating Disponees  Let us now proceed to give other Examples upon this Head  EXAMPLE I  Let us suppose  mo  A Deathbed Deed compleated but reducible by the Heir  do  A second Deathbed Deed of the same Subject consented to by the Heir  The first Deed cuts out the second the second cuts out the Heir and the Heir again cuts out the first  To clear this Case it must be premised as a Thing taken for granted that the Heir's Consent here operates not a  Conveyance  of his Privilege but barely a Renunciation thereof with respect to the Right consented to If it did operate a Conveyance there could be no Difficulty in the Question because upon that Supposition the Reduction would be competent to the second Disponee as well as to the Heir himself Taking the Consent then as operating only a  Renunciation  the Decision must come out in Favours of the first Disponee He stands first in the Order of Time and as for the personal Challenge competent to the Heir against him the Challenge is barred by the  jus tertii  the interveening Disposition consented to rendring it fruitless to  the Heir to insist upon his Privilege And thus it happens that a Consent or other Deed designed in Favours of one may yet accrue solely to the Benefit of another  EXAMPLE II    mo  A base Infeftment of Ward Lands  do  A publick Infeftment of the same confirmed by the Superior which excludes Recognition  tio  The Superior upon his Privilege of Recognition  This Case is plainly of the same Nature with the former It is  jus tertii  for the Superior to plead upon his Recognition because he can have no Benefit thereby unless this Consideration be brought in to difference the Cases drawn from the Nature of Holdings  viz  that a Superior has an Interest to choose his own Vassal which may be alledged as sufficient to found him in his Challenge against the base Infeftment altho' he have no further Inrerest in the Question but that he be Vassal whom he has chosen and whose Right he has consented to This Dispute I shall leave  in medio  as a little foreign to the Subject in Hand  It must here be taken along That Recognition is understood only as a personal Privilege competent to the Superior Were it  in ipso jure  Nullity the Decision at any Rate would go otherwise Upon that Supposition the second Disponee publickly infeft might found upon it  per  Pos VI  jus tertii  EXAMPLE III    mo  A base Infeftment  do  A publick Infeftment  tio  The Superior in Right of Ward  In this Case the publick Infeftment is good against the Ward as holding of the Superior himself and therefore it is plainly  jus tertii  for the Superior to insist against the base Infeftment in so far as he is excluded from the Benefit of the Ward by the publick Infeftment And therefore the base Infeftment will come out preferable  EXAMPLE IV    mo  A base Infeftment  do  Terce or Courtesy  tio  The Superior by Ward or Recognition  In this Case also it is plain that in so far as the Superior is excluded by the Terce or Courtesy in so far will the base Infeftment have the Benefit thereof  EXAMPLE V    mo  An Adjudication with a Charge against the Superior  do  Voluntary Disposition with Infeftment reducible as being granted  in cursu diligentiae  of the first Adjudger  tio  Adjudger within Year and Day of the first  In this Case the Disposition excludes the second Adjudication and is excluded by the first in so far as the first would draw were the Disposition not in the Field And so it will come out that the first Adjudger will have the Half of the Fund providing his Debt amount so high and the Disponee will enjoy the Remainder  EXAMPLE VI    mo  A Charge of Horning  do  An Assignation of a Bond to a Creditor reducible by the Charger  on the Act  tio  Arrestment thereafter laid on by a third Creditor in Hands of the Debitor in the Bond  Here the Assignation will stand good against Reduction in respect that it is  jus tertii  for the Charger to found upon it being at any Rate excluded by the Arrestment  EXAMPLE VII    mo  An Adjudger with a Charge against the Superior  do  An Adjudger infeft without Year and Day  tio  An Infeftment upon a voluntary Disposition which Disposition is of a Date prior to the Citation in the Adjudications  In this Case the Adjudger infeft is preferable  EXAMPLE VIII    mo  A personal onerous Bond  do  An Infeftment upon a posterior gratuitous Disposition granted in the Circumstances of Bankruptcy  tio  An Infeftment upon an Adjudication for an onerous Debt contracted after the gratuitous Disposition with which Adjudication the first onerous Creditor adjudging does not come in  pari passu  Here the gratuitous Disposition comes out preferable  We shall conclude with some Decisions that have past upon this Subject  An Infeftment of Annualrent being after the first Apprising and before the second all three were brought in  pari passu  being within Year and Day the Statute being new and dubious  Stair    February    Brown  contra  Nichols  This Case is handled above  The next Decision I shall mention is the Competition amongst the Creditors of  Langtoun    January  This being a curious Case and pretty stifly debated I shall give it at full Length as observed by a very eminent Hand  Langtoun  's Affairs having gone into Disorder in the Beginning of the Year about the Time of his Retiring he grants many heritable Bonds of Corroboration whereupon Infeftments followed before any Adjudications could be expede and there were also many Inhibitions some older some later before the granting of several of these Bonds of Corroboration and the Creditors did all generally adjudge within Year and Day The Debts and Diligences did far exceed the Debitor's Estate Whereupon a Competition of Creditors arising several Questions did occur which had never formerly been determined especially in the Ranking of simple and inhibiting Adjudgers and Annualrenters which Questions were pled and determined without Names of Parties but upon the Nature of their several Rights and Diligences  For the Annualrenters it was alledged That their Infeftments of Annualrent being prior to all the Adjudgers they were preferable and their Annualrents payable in the first Place before an Adjudger could draw any Share of the Rents  And for the Inhibiters that the Sums in their Inhibitions must be fully satisfied before the posterior Annualrenters could draw any Share  And for the simple Adjudgers on Debts anterior to the Inhibitions that the said Inhibitions could not be any ways prejudicial to their Debts but  that they as Coadjudgers with the Inhibiters ought to draw the same Share as if no Inhibition had been used  These several Propositions were all severally founded upon known Principles of Law in case of Competition betwixt any two of the three contending Parties but not reconcileable to one another in the Competition of simple and adjudging Inhibiters and Annualrenters which was the Case that lay before the Lords to be decided  The Lords after many Hearings  in presentia  and very mature Deliberation and Reasoning amongst themselves did at last come to establish certain Rules for determining the present Question and the like that might occur in other Processes of Ranking which of late had fallen to be more frequent and the Decisions more accurate in Regard of the late Acts of Parliament anent the Sale of Bankrupts Estates  The Rules established by the Lords were these  First  That an Inhibiteradjudger did not simply reduce posterior Annualrenters but only in as far as these Annualrenters were prejudicial to the Inhibiter And found That Inhibiters would draw such a Share of the Rents or in case of Sale of the Property of the Estate as would have belonged to them if no posterior voluntary Rights had been granted And found That anterior Creditors adjudging within Year and Day of the Inhibiter could not be prejudged by the Inhibition but that anterior Creditors adjudging would draw the same Share of the common Debitor's Estate as if there had been no Inhibition used  By this Decision the Inhibiter did not obtain full Payment of the Sums in the Inhibition before  the Annualrenter could draw any Share nor did the Annualrenter lose all but a Part only nor was the Annualrenter allowed to recur upon Adjudgers for anterior Debts for making up that Share which the Inhibiter reduced and cut off As for Example suppose the Case That the Subject affected is worth Merks and that there are three Adjudgers  pari passu  for Merks each and one Annualrenter effeiring to Merks and that one of the Adjudgers is also an Inhibiter before contracting the Annualrenter's Debt the Division falls thus The three Adjudgers for equal Sums do first divide the Merks in equal Parts whereof each draws Merks and thereby lose each Merks the Annualrenter being a common Burden on the Subject affected and preferable to all the Adjudications claims Merks from each of the three Adjudgers as a Stock effeiring to his Annualrent but the inhibiting Adjudger strikes off his Claim by virtue of his Diligence of Inhibition but the posterior Adjudgers having no Defence the Annualrenter draws Merks from each of them whereby the inhibiting Adjudger gets his full third Share with the Coadjudgers but loses Merks of his whole Sum and the Annualrenter loses Merks and gets Merks and the Coadjudgers get each Merks of the remaining Merks  According to this Rule the Lords did uniformly determine in all subsequent Rankings and Sales for several Years And the Rules are found practicable in all the Variety of Cases that did occur in the several Processes of Sale which have been very frequent since that Time But thereafter in the Case of  arridden  there happened a special Circumstance  which had not been pled when the Rule was established and some Alteration had also happened on the Bench since that Decision whereupon the whole Foundation of that Rule and Decision was called in Question and often debated  in presentia  and several Bills And after a Review and full Consideration of the Case the Lords did proceed upon the same Foundation and strengthned the former Rule  Carridden  's Case occurred in the Competition of the Creditors of  Cockburnspath  a Part of  Nicolson  's Estate and he being an Inhibiter and also an Adjudger within Year and Day the Lords found his Adjudication null But he insisted as Inhibiter for reducing the Right of several Debts after his Inhibition whereon Adjudication had been led within Year and Day of other Adjudgers on Debts anterior alledging That he could not be wholly excluded while these Adjudgers on posterior Debts were admitted to a Share of the Price for he could still adjudge whereby his Adjudication would be drawn back to his Inhibition and always be preferable to such Adjudgers whose Debts were posterior to his Diligence  To which it was answered That his Adjudication could afford him no Share because setting aside all the posterior Creditors the Diligences on anterior Debts were far beyond the Value of the Subject of the Competition And seeing his Inhibition could not prejudge these anterior Debts nor Diligences it afforded no Prejudice to him that posterior Creditors by their Diligence came in  pari passu  to get a Share with anterior Creditors because tho' these posterior Debts had never been contracted  Carridden  was utterly excluded and his Inhibition  was only a prohibitory Diligence whereupon he could not reduce posterior Debts simply but in so far as they were prejudicial to his Debt and his Afteradjudication could not state him in the Case of these posterior Annualrenters so as to make the Benefit of their Annualrents accresce to him  Upon the several Debates in that Case the Lords at last by their Interlocutor th  February  found That an Inhibiter cannot be prejudged by posterior Debts nor anterior Creditors prejudged by an Inhibiter And found That the contracting of Debts after an Inhibition could not be profitable to an Inhibiter nor does their Diligence accresce to him and that therefore  Carriden  could draw no Share of the Price of  Cockburnspath  According to these Rules all the Rankings have ever proceeded uniformly without any Contradiction But of late in the Competition of the Creditors of  Langtoun  that Rule was again called in Question And upon a Petition several Times moved by the Inhibiters a Hearing allowed  in presentia  in which it was alledged That the Rule above set down could not consist with the true Effect of an Inhibition which was not only a prohibitory but a preparatory Diligence and that an Adjudication coming after whether within Year and Day of other Adjudgers or not was always to be drawn back to the Date of the Inhibition so as to remove all posterior Annualrents or other Diligences on posteriorDebts and these being removed the Inhibiter fell to come in to get the full Payment of the Debts in his Inhibition at least to the Extent of the voluntary Rights and then the Annualrenter being preferable by the Nature of his Right and Security  came in the next Place to get the full Payment preferable to posterior Coadjudgers As for Example In the Case formerly stated of a Subject to the Value of Merks and three Adjudgers for Merks each and an Annualrenter effeiring to Merks the Annualrenter as preferable draws first his Share  sciz  Merks which is set aside so the remaining Merks being divided in three each Adjudger gets Merks But the inhibiting Adjudger recurs upon the Annualrenter by virtue of his Diligence from whom he draws Merks more to make up his Merks then the Annualrenter by the Nature of his Right being preferable to the Coadjudgers recurs on them from whom he draws the said Merks so remains only to the Coadjudgers Merks  For inforcing this the Inhibiter insisted upon the Nature of the Diligence alledging That the Adjudger's Diligence reach'd nothing but the Reversion over and above the Annualrent which was preferable upon every Part of the Subject adjudged and therefore the Inhibiter getting his full Share by virtue of his Adjudication and Inhibition the Annualrent lay upon the Shares of the Coadjudgers and it often happens that an Inhibiter gets a better Share by Reason of posterior voluntary Rights than he would have had without them As for Example Suppose that in place of a Right of Annualrent a posterior Creditor had obtained either a proper Wadset or a redeemable Right of a Part of the Debitor's Estate and being thereupon infeft was preferable to the posterior Adjudgers in that Case the Inhibiter would have an equal Share with the Coadjudgers if within Year and Day  and what were wanting would be made up to him by affecting the Wadset or Right of Property made after his Inhibition wherein the Coadjudgers would have no Share nor Interest and by that Means the full Sum in the Inhibition would be made up and he in a much better Condition than he would have been if no posterior Right had been granted And suppose again That this Inhibiter had not adjudged within Year and Day he would indeed have had no Share in the Reversion or Superplus with prior Adjudgers but his Diligence would have been drawn back to procure to him full Payment of the Sums in his Inhibition at least so far as the Value of the posterior voluntary Right did extend to And there is no Reason that the Case of an Inhibiter should be worse where there is a posterior Annualrent than it would be if no proper Wadset or partial Right had been granted  To all which it was answered That the Rules above laid down are most just and equitable and nothing material objected  The fundamental Rules are  mo  That an Inhibiter cannot be prejudged by posterior Debts  do  That an anterior Creditor can no ways be prejudged by an Inhibition whereas by what's now pled an Inhibition would strike more effectually against the prior Creditor than the posterior Annualrenter For tho' the Inhibiter recurs upon the Annualenter as posterior the Annualrenter recurrs again upon the Adjudgers whose Debts were contracted prior to the Inhibition by which Means the Annualrenter loses nothing tho' the Inhibition ought only to strike against posterior voluntary Deeds and the Adjudger on prior Debts is at the whole Loss albeit it be a most certain Principle  that an Inhibition has no imaginable Effect against anterior Debts and Diligences following thereupon So that there must certainly be a Fallacy in that Reasoning and there is no Manner of Mystery or the least Difficulty in finding where the Fallacy lies  viz  an Inhibition is no Ground Reduction of posterior Debts simply to anull them but only in so far as they are prejudicial to the Debt in the Inhibition that is to say in so far as the Inhibiter falls to draw a less Share of the Estate or Rents thereof than he would have obtained if no posterior voluntary Deed had been done And an Inhibition is merely a prohibitory Diligence for removing the Prejudice of posterior Deeds but does not give any positive Right nor state the Inhibiter Adjudger in Place of the Annualrenter so as to draw a Share by Virtue of the Right of Annualrent as the Inhibiter must acknowledge by his own Argument for if the Inhibiter came in Place of the Annualrenter that is to say if the Right of Annualrent did accresce to the Inhibiter then the Inhibiter getting Payment in the Right of the Annualrent would extinguish the Annualrent and consequently the Annualrenter could never recur upon the Coadjudgers So that the Scheme offered by the Inhibiters is inconsistent with Law and Reason in every Circumstance For the Inhibiter can never have what was competent to the Annualrenter but by coming in his Place and causing the Annualrent to accresce which were a Notion absurd and inconsistent And what's urged that an Inhibition is not only a prohibitory but a preparatory Diligence is a new invented Notion never heard of in any former Case and without any Foundation in Law  And whereas it is alledged That in the Case of a proper Wadset or a partial Right of Property after Inhibition and before the Adjudications the Inhibiter strikes out the posterior Wadsetter or Purchaser and comes in his Place from which 'tis inferred  mo  That an Inhibiter may have Advantage by posterior voluntary Deeds  do  What must be acknowledged to be in the Case of a proper Wadset or an irredeemable Right of Property ought also to hold in the Case betwixt the competing Annualrenter and Inhibiter  It is answered That in the Case proposed an Inhibiter may have an accidental Advantage in the Competition with other Creditors by posterior voluntary Deeds For the Inhibiter would not only have a Share with the Coadjudgers in the Reversion of the Debitor's other Estate but further would affect the Lands irredeemably disponed or wadset after his Inhibition but cannot have the like Benefit in the Case of an Annualrenter and it often happens that by a Competition a greater Benefit arises to some Creditors than would do if some of the Parties competing were out of the Field because in a Competition of many Creditors there must be general Rules and Foundations in Law with Regard to the Rights and Interests of the several Creditors competing which alter if the Rights of some of these Creditors be drawn out of the Field As for Example In the Competition betwixt an Inhibition and a posterior voluntary Right without the Concourse of other Creditors the Inhibition is alalways preferable but in the Competition of many other Creditors the Inhibition may happen to be totally excluded and posterior Rights get a Share  To apply this to the Case proposed a proper Wadsetter or a Right of Property of a Part of the Debitor's Estate does wholly separate and set apart the Wadset Right or the Property from the Debitor's Estate in Competition with posterior Adjudgers whereby they are intirely excluded from that Wadset or Right of Property but  quoad  the Inhibiter the Wadset or Right of Property is null and therefore the inhibiting Adjudger removing the voluntary Right by his Inhibition comes to receive the Benefit of the voluntary Right so far as is wanting to him by his Diligence in Competition with Coadjudgers or other Creditors Whereof the Reason is plain because such voluntary Rights do in the first Place wholly exclude Adjudgers not Inhibiters and then the Competition falls singly betwixt Inhibiters and posterior Purchasers and in the Competition of these two the Inhibiter is ever preferred but that makes nothing to the Advantage of what is now urged to be a Rule in the Competition of simple and inhibiting Adjudgers and Annualrenters For    mo  The posterior Wadsetter or Purchaser so excluded does not recur upon the posterior Adjudgers but only suffers the Loss as having rested upon voluntary Rights without Diligence and so the Rule above set down That prior Creditors are not prejudged by the Inhibition stands still good whereas in the present Debate it is alledged That as the Inhibiter recurrs upon the Annualrenter so the Annualrenter also recurrs upon Adjudgers and anterior Debts    do  There is a manifest Disparity betwixt the Case of an Annualrenter and a proper Wadsetter or Purchaser of a Part of the Debitor's Estate by an  irredeemable Right for the last two do intirely divide and separate the Wadset or irredeemable Right from the Remainder of the Debitor's Estate and thereby does wholly withdraw his Purchase from the posterior Adjudgers whereas an Annualrent Right resembles a Servitude and is a Burden consisting with the Property and affecting every Part thereof and therefore the posterior Adjudgers carry the Property so affected And when these Adjudgers divide the Property or the Rents the Annualrent which lies as a Burden is equally proportioned amongst the Adjudgers according to their Dividend But that Proportion of the Annualrent which falls upon the Share of the inhibiting Adjudger is struck off whereby he gets the same Share that would have fallen to him if there had been no Annualrent and because the said Share of the Annualrent is cut off by the Diligence of an Inhibition the Annualrenter is at a Loss and cannot recur upon the Adjudgers who did not inhibit because the Inhibition can no more prejudge anterior Creditors than posterior Deeds can prejudge the Inhibiter As for Example In the Case above stated of a Competition for a Stock of Merks the three Adjudgers  pari passu  for Merks each get only Merks and the Annualrenter effeiring to Merks gets Merks from each of the two Adjudgers who did not inhibit but draws nothing from the Inhibiter as being after his Diligence And suppose again That the Inhibiter were not  pari passu  with the other two Adjudgers but Year and Day after them these two Adjudgers would first draw their full Merks out of the common Stock whereby there would remain Merks to the Annualrenter and then the Annualrenter would  draw his other Merks from the two first Adjudgers which would make up his whole Annualrent but the Inhibiter who was not within Year and Day would reduce the Annualrent in so far as extended to the Merks more than fell to the first two Adjudgers because tho' the first two Adjudgers were preferable as to their Merks and in so far as the Annualrenter draw from them the Inhibiter was not prejudged yet as to the Superplus of Merks the Competition falling betwixt the Inhibiter and a posterior Annualrenter the Inhibiter is intirely preferred But suppose again That there were three Adjudgers  pari passu  still for Merks and an Inhibiter Adjudger Year and Day after for the like Sum and an Annualrenter as formerly in that Case the three Adjudgers on anterior Debts would each draw Merks and the Annualrenter would draw Merks from each of them and so obtain full Payment and the Inhibiter Adjudger not within Year and Day would get nothing albeit the posterior Annualrenter gets all as was found in the forecited Case of  Carridden  because the Inhibiter is not prejudged by the Annualrenter who can never compete if the Question were betwixt them two but the whole Stock being affected and exhausted by preferable Adjudications for anterior Debts the Inhibiter is thereby effectually excluded by his own Negligence and the Diligence of the other Creditors and is noways prejudged by the Annualrenter who by his Preference to the Coadjudgers gets his full Annualrent which the Inhibiter ought not to envy and can not quarrel the Annualrenter's Advantage not being in Defraud and Prejudice of him And thus it happens that in the Competition of many  Creditors the Division being made according to Foundations and Principles of Law a voluntary Right obtains Preference and Payment when an anterior Inhibiter is wholly excluded not by the Annualenter but by other competing Creditors and it is a mistaken Notion of the Import of an Inhibition to imagine that an Inhibition gives any positive Right or that the Inhibiter is prejudged as long as he gets not his full Payment preferrable to posterior Annualrents for the Effect of his Diligence is only that he do not get less than if these Annualrents had not been granted or that in Competition with voluntary Rights alone and without the Intervention of other competing Creditors the Inhibiter is always preferred to the voluntary Right But where other Creditors come in  pari passu  or are preferable to the Inhibiter and postponed to the Annualrenter every Creditor draws his Share according to the Nature of his Right and Diligence  The Lords found That in the Competition of simple and inhibiting Adjudgers and Annualrenters the inhibiting Adjudger could only reduce the posterior Annualrent in so far as he was thereby prejudged and that he could not claim full Payment of the Sums in his Inhibition before the Annualrenter could draw any Share in the said Competition but could only draw such a Share of the Annualrents or Price as he would have drawn if there had been no posterior Annualrent or voluntary Right  The Estate of  Tofts  being sold at a publick Roup and the Decreet of Ranking remitted to an Accomptant to draw out a Scheme of the Division of the Price amongst the Creditors an Objection was  started against the Scheme to understand which the following Fact is necessary to be known  mo Susanna Belshes  had an inhibition in the and Adjudication upon the same Ground of Debt in  do Kippenross  had an Inhibition in the with an heritable Bond of Corroboration and Infeftment in the which Infeftment was struck at by  Susanna Belshes  her Inhibition  tio  A Set of Annualrenters some prior some posterior to  Kippenross  but all of them struck at by his Inhibition  to  A Sett of Adjudgers in the coming in  pari passu  with  Susanna Belshes  her Adjudication struck at by neither of the Inhibitions To reduce this Case to its simplest Terms and to throw off extraneous Circumstances  Kippenross  's Inhibition and the Effect thereof was first considered which striking only against the posterior Annualrenters the Case was taken up as if these Annualrenters were not in the Field And at the same Time the Inhibition itself was laid aside it having thus got its full Effect by throwing out of the Field every Right it struck against This being premis'd the Case reduc'd to its simplest Terms came out thus  mo  An Infeftment of Annualrent  soiz Kippenross  's  do  Posterior Adjudgers coming in  pari passu  of which Adjudgers one  soiz Susanna Belshes  has an Inhibition that strikes against the Infeftment of Annualrent  The Question is How are these Creditors to draw their Proportions The Annualrenter is ranked  primo loco  and the Inhibiter without doubt draws from him whatever she could draw were he not in the Field So far the Matter is clear But now the Dispute comes Can the Annualrenter recur against the other Adjudgers against whom the  Inhibition strikes not for any Share of what was drawn from him by the Inhibition The Scheme says No the Objector says Yes  To go to the Foundation of this Matter it must be carefully attended to that an Inhibition is in itself no  real  Right gives no Preference in the Subject not being directed against the Land but against the competing Creditors such of them as it strikes against In a Word being but a  personal  Prohibition directed against Creditors it affords only a  personal  Challenge which does not alter or disturb the  real  Preferences  For Example If there be three Annualrenters  A B C  following one another in the Order of Time and ranked accordingly Let us suppose that  C  the last Annualrenter has an Inhibition striking against  A  the first Annualrenter Let the Estate be and the Value of each of the Annualrent Rights In this Case the Method of drawing can be no other but this  A  the first Annualrenter is preferred  primo loco  and draws his whole Sum  viz  By which his AnnualrentRight falls to be extinguished by Payment  B  the second Annualrenter draws all that remains being other And thus so far as concerns the  real  and  direct  Preferences  C  the last Annalrenter is cut off and draws nothing But then when we go to consider the Pretences that one Right or Diligence may have against another which my Lord  Stair  terms  Page    The partial Reasons of Reduction  we find that  C  has an Inhibition against  A  and therefore must draw from him whatever he would have drawn by Vertue of his AnnualrentRight had  A  never existed which is no less than his And thus the ultimate Division comes out  B  gets  C  gets and  A  gets nothing Now in this Case the Objector must say that  A  recurs against  B  for what was drawn from him by the Inhibiter which lands in giving  C    A  and  B  nothing And he comes at this Conclusion by conceiving  C  by Virtue of his Inhibition preferable in the first Place  A  in the second Place and  B  in the last Place which is plainly fallacious  mo  Because an Inhibition as said is gives no  real  Preference  do  Because it is evident let  A  and  C  adjust their Preferences as they best can that  B  the second Annualrenter against whom the Inhibition strikes not must possess the second Place So that if we shall allow  C  by Vertue of his Inhibition to take up the first Place naturally due to  A  that cannot harm  B A  being thus beat out of his Place cannot dispossess  B  but must upon that Supposition fall back to the last Place And were this otherwise great Absurdities would follow According to the Objector's Scheme as was just now demonstrated the Estate being and each of the Annualrents  C  the Inhibiter draws his whole Claim  A  his whole Claim and  B  gets nothing at all What is this but to say that the Inhibition excludes  B  tho' it has no Cause of Reduction against it and preserves  A  tho' it is against  A  only that it strikes  There is another Case which tends much to illustrate this Doctrine Let us suppose a Liferentrix who having the preferable Right upon the Estate consents to the Preference of another Creditor which Wives are frequently led to do Let us suppose at the same Time a third Creditor who has an Infeftment of Annualrent interjected betwixt the LiferentRight and the Right consented to 'Tis plain that the  Consent  here alters nothing of the  real  Preferences The Liferentrix falls to be ranked  primo loco  the other Creditor  secundo loco  and the Right consented to  ultimo loco  And in that Order they must draw their respective Proportions and the Estate of Consequence be disburdened The Right indeed ranked in the last Place by Vertue of the Consent must draw from the Liferentrix whatever it would have drawn had the Liferentrix not been in the Field But sure this could never intitle the Liferentrix to recur against the Annualrent ranked in the second Place whose Right the Consent harms not As to him the  Consent  is  res inter alios  which can neither hurt him or do him Service The Foundation of Law is precisely the same in the Case of Inhibition The Effect of which is restricted against the Creditors which it strikes at and in no Case can either harm or benefit others  All this is to clear the Method of making out Schemes in Rankings which has been continually practised and followed ever since the Viscount of  Stair  's Time who was the first that fixed this Rule  viz  That the  real  Rights must first be ranked according to their Preference and having drawn their Sums accordingly the Estate falls to be disburdened of them and they extinguished by Payment In the next Place must be considered the partial  Pretensions  or Reasons of Reduction that any of the Creditors may have against others As to such the Rule is  "That whatever is drawn from a preferable Creditor upon any personal Consideration intitles him not to recur against any other preferable Creditor posterior to him against whom the personal Consideration militates not"  See  Stair Page  at the Foot  To apply all to the Case in dispute which is that of an Annualrenter and two posterior Adjudgers one of which has an Inhibition striking against the Annualrenter my Lord  Stair  in the above cited Place has well fixed that the AnnualrentRight must be ranked first and the Adjudications in the second Place  pari passu  Then he considers the Effect of the Inhibiter's  personal  Claim against the Annualrenter but allows not the Annualrenter at all to recur against the other Adjudger for what was drawn from him by the Inhibition which were landing in the above Absurdity no less than allowing the Annualrenter when he is beat out of his own Place to take up the second Place and dispossess thereby the Adjudger whose Place by Right it is whereby the Inhibition would come to strike against the Adjudger and not against the Annualrenter in express Contradiction to the Intendment of the Diligence which the Law says in this Case strikes only against the Annualrenter and not against the Adjudger Now here the Objector would have the inhibiting Adjudger to be ranked in the first Place and thereby to take up the Place of the Annualrenter because the Inhibition strikes against him He would have the Annualrenter struck out of his own Place to take up the second Place possessed by the Adjudger and he would send the second Adjudger thus unjustly dispossest to seek his Redress off the first Adjudger in the best Manner he can which is evidently contrary to the Nature of the Thing and the Conception of these Diligences  To sum up all when  Kippenross  pleads upon his Inhibition no doubt it must have its Effect and thereby must be struck out all the posterior Infeftments  of Annualrent In the next Place when he pleads upon his Infeftment he has a Title to be ranked for his whole Sum he is accordingly ranked and draws his whole Sum and thus his Infeftment has also its full Effect There is indeed a  personal  Claim upon him by Vertue of an Inhibition which takes from him some Share of his Draught But this  personal  Claim the other  real  Creditors have no Concern with as to them 'tis plainly  res inter alios  they cannot be lesed thereby The Inhibition militates against  Kippenross  's Annualrent not against the posterior Adjudgers They cannot be in a better or worse Situation than if that Inhibition were not in the Field and therefore whatever  Susanna Belshes  her Inhibition draws from  Kippenross  this cannot burden the Adjudgers or put them in any Situation by which they shall draw one Farthing less than if the Inhibition never had existed  The Lords found That  Kippenross  's Infeftment being once ranked so as to draw his Share in Competition with the other  real  Creditors that he could not recur against the posterior  real  Creditors for any Part of what was drawn from him by  Susanna Belshes  her Inhibition  Feb    Campbell  contra  Drummond  In a reclaiming Petition the Objector against the Scheme endeavoured to turn his Argument into another Shape he pled according to the Rule laid down by Lord  Stair Page  §  "That the Adjudgers are to be accounted as joint Proprietars and the Infeftments of Annualrenters as Servitudes on the Property"  Whence he drew this Consequence That as it is the Property of an Annualrentright to affect every Part of the Ground  in solidum  in which  unaquaequa gleba servit  therefore it was in  Kippenross  's Power to draw his whole Sum out of the simple Adjudger's Part and he behoved so to do because he was barred by the Inhibition from any Demand upon the inhibiting Adjudger But the Answer was obvious to the Lords  mo  That this Argument went upon a Fallacy supposing each Adjudger to be possessed of a different Tenement without any Connexion or Relation to one another and the Annualrent a Burden upon both Whereas the Subject was but one and the Adjudgers had each of them a Right over the whole  pro indiviso  Attending to this the Objectors Argument falls to the Ground because before there could be any Access to make a Partition of the Land itself or the Price coming in its Place betwixt the two Adjudgers all the Burdens upon the joint Property must have been considered and paid off so as to leave the Remainder clear to be divided equally betwixt the Adjudgers  do Esto  the Scheme should be framed in this Way which the Objectors seems to point at  sciz  first to divide the common Subject betwixt the two Adjudgers joint Proprietars To be sure the next Thing to be done was to divide the common Burdens also by which Means no more but the one Half of the Annualrent would fall to be a Burden upon the simple Adjudger 'Tis true this could not limit the Annualrenter's Right who might notwithstanding draw his whole Sum from the simple Adjudger But then the simple Adjudger who had not only paid his own Share of the Annualrentright but also that Share which by the Division was laid upon his Coadjudger would without Controversy be intitled to  Recourse  against the Coadjudger as  having paid a Debt which he the Coadjudger was ultimately liable in And this brings it back precisely where it was before by the other Method of Calculation And indeed it would be absurd that two Schemes both right occasioned only by taking up the Matter in different Lights should terminate in different Conclusions Upon which Considerations the Lords refused the Bill without Answers  Observations upon Prescription  _AS Man is not formed complete in himself but an indigent Being standing in Need of daily Supplies from without The Deity has bestowed the Earth upon Man and Men upon one another Towards this End he has wisely implanted in our Natures the remarkable Affections to PROPERTY and SOCIETY In this equally provident as in his other Dispensations to Mankind not only to furnish us sufficient  Means  but which is admirable to compel us in the most agreeable Manner to make Choice of and embrace these  Means  Possibly at first when the World was thinly peopled and great Plenty of common Necessaries of Life the Affection for  Property  was small and the natural Notions of  Appropriation  little cultivated But as Mankind grew numerous and the Necessaries of Life not so easily come at Labour and Industry became of Value and PROPERTY to be considered For without Property Labour and Industry was in vain The Foundation of Property  a posteriori  is apparent that it is also founded  a priori  in the Nature of  Man and consequently in the original Laws is also certain Evident from this that Nature which makes nothing in vain has provided every Person with an AFFECTION to Property wherein is founded that Connection betwixt Men and Things which we call commonly by the Name of PROPERTY and whereby Nature prompts a Man to be differently  affected  to one Thing from another and which Affection leads us to bestow Care in preserving Labour and Industry in improving what we thus consider as our own and frequently enhances the Value of it in our Imagination above Reality and above the Value we attribute to any other Thing that does not stand with us in that Relation This AFFECTION is as much founded in Nature as that we bear to our Children or any Affection whatever And the Design is admirable for 'tis this Affection that is the  primum mobile  of all that Industry and Diligence Men bestow upon their Affairs Providence foresaw Appropriation necessary and it fitted us with  Affections  and  Faculties  leading to that End And thus PROPERTY is founded  a priori  in the Nature of Man or which is the same in the abstract Laws of Nature The abstract Laws relating to whatever Species of Beings being nothing else but the Regulations their Natures and Constitution prompt and direct them to govern themselves by  PROPERTY being thus founded in the Law of Nature there are MEANS of acquiring and losing it founded also in the same Law OCCUPATION is the primary MEAN of acquiring Property and DERELI  TION of losing it When we relinquish our Property by any express positive Act of the Will no Body questions the Effect  But it has not been so clearly understood that the same Effect may be wrought negatively by  Neglect Desertion  or  Disuse  Most Writers agree that Prescription is a Creature only of positive Statute not at all founded in the Law of Nature thus  Grotius Jur Bell L    C  thus  Puffendorf L    C  But let us examine humane Nature Let us see what it says as to this Dispute for to it must ly the ultimate Appeal Let us suppose that by some Accident one loses a Jewel he's concerned and contrives all Means for Recovery The Affection of Property exerts itself and during that Time the Thing is as much his as ever His Attempts prove unsuccessful Hope loses Ground he despairs By Degrees his Loss wears out of his Mind His Affection cools and at last evanishes He loses intirely the Consciousness of Property Thus the Matter lies over for many Years My Position is That the Connection betwixt the Man and his Jewel is by those Means as throughly dissolved as if he had derelinquished it by the most positive Act or as if it had never been his The Affection and Consciousness ceases upon which his Property is founded and Property ceases of Consquence 'Tis upon this Foundation that Things lost by Shipwreck after such long Time as the Proprietor has given over all Hope of Recovery go to the first Finder  L    Ad R D  'Tis upon the same that a Hunter so soon as he gives over Hope of his Quarry loses that Title of Prevention which he had by the Pursuit after which the Law gives Access to the next Finder If this hold with Respect to the Person himself who once had the Affection of Property much more with Respect to his Heirs who never were in Possession and possibly  in Time may have intirely lost the Knowledge of their Predecessors Right Thus then Dereliction may be distinguished into two Kinds positive or active and negative or passive The positive Act is properly ABDICATION and hereafter when we intend to express the negative we shall indifferently use the Terms of DERELICTION or DESERTION  Let us now put the Case that the Jewel is found by a Person who after using all the proper Means of discovering an Owner takes it up upon the Footing of Dereliction To make the Case stronger instead of a Jewel let us suppose a Piece of Ground or something else that the Finder may possibly imagine never had been appropriated He continues to possess as Proprietor He lays out Money builds a House and makes great Embellishments The Estate descends from Father to Son The natural Affection increases by Time to this paternal Inheritance which has been now in the same Family if you will for several Centuries At last the former Proprietor comes and claims the Ground he shows after what Manner his Predecessors were led to forsake their Country and Possessions During all that Interval they had been abroad in another Land where they fixed their Heart and Residence without the least View or Prospect of ever revisiting their native Soil till by some Accident like the former Fortune led them back to the Country from whence they originally sprung Let any Man consider seriously this Case and consult his own Heart about it he will find this Claim to be against Nature and Reason The Demand has no other Foundation but a  quondam  Property long ago deserted and given over for lost 'Tis directed against a  Person whose Predecessors have been  bona fide  in Possession Time out of Mind and justly esteemed themselves truly Proprietors A Demand of this Kind is obviously against Nature The first Proprietor deserted his Possession lost his Affection to it whereby as to all real Effects the Case comes to be the same as it had never been his Another Person is suffered peaceably and honestly to take up the deserted Possession He has no Reason to be suspicious of this more than of any other vacant Spot of Ground His Affection grows to the Subject as his own Property it becomes as strong as he had bought it nay we may suppose he actually bought it or obtained it by some other the most indisputed Title If the Law thereafter take it from him it takes it from a Man who cannot help thinking it unjustly tore from him and who is thereby made a real Sufferer to be given to another whose Pretensions are quite wore out by Course of Time and who is thus made  locupletior aliena jactura  It can never be in the Law of Nature to indulge such Hardships It will be granted to be perfectly agreeable to humane Nature that a Man indulge his Affection in such Acquisition At first indeed 'tis reasonable to have some Doubts these must wear off necessarily by the Course of Time till at the long Run the Possessor acquires the most solid Affection to and Security in the Thing as his own After so good a Foundation built in humane Nature it never can be agreeable to the  Laws  of that Nature to overturn such a Foundation by wresting the Property from him which were in other Words to say That Nature dictates to be secure and insecure at the same Time  The Matter comes here in one Word the longer a Man possesses  bona fide  the greater is  his Security in the Thing and Affection to it till at length both become extreme The Laws of Nature ought to protect every Possessor in reasonable Security and Affection which are of Nature's Growth and not prefer him who has neither Security nor Affection And thus by the Law of Nature  "A long continued  bona fide  Possession is a good Title for acquiring Property"  It will conduce to the better illustrating of this Doctrine if we take a View of the Effects of  bona fide  Possession in its full Extent The  bona fide  Possessor from the very Beginning is allowed to consume the Fruits The true Proprietor let him put in his Claim when he will has no Demand upon that Score The Reason is That as Property is introduced for the Conveniency and Support of Mankind 'tis better any Man consume the Fruits than that they be lost to every Body And therefore are given to the Possessor who has a Title such as to convince the Judges that he was in  bona fide  to consider himself as Proprietor And as from the Nature of the Thing Titles to Property are extremely uncertain 'tis the Interest of Mankind that they be keeped secure against Afterreckonings of this Nature 'Tis but enlarging this Thought to give Security to the Possessor after great Length of Time in the Thing itself when the former Possessor has lost his Affection and all Thought of Recovery For is not all this answering the true Design of Property by making it subservient to the Uses and Necessities of Mankind Are not these very Laws anent Property  sciz  That it cannot be taken away without Consent of the Owner and such like introduced for the same I nd those very Laws that seen most opposite to this Doctrine  But what is the Result of all None other but this That the End is the true Touchstone to judge of the Preference of the Means Thus in common Cases the Rule ought to be sacred That no Man's Property be tore from him without his Consent because otherwise the great End proposed by Appropriation could not be brought about But then if in any Circumstance the rigid Observance of this Rule shall be so far from conducing to the End proposed that it will be flying directly in the Face of it in that Circumstance it must yield to some other Rule more adapted to bring about that End And he who in that Circumstance does notwithstanding adhere to the Rule is guilty of the plain Absurdity of preferring the  Mean  to the  End  Prescription necessarily presupposes two Persons one who loses and another who gains thereby This is evident for all the Ways known in Law to deprive a Man of any of his Rights and Privileges are in Favours of and with a View to the Interest of others Prescription is of two Kinds the POSITIVE whereby is gained a Power over the Property or Person of another the NEGATIVE whereby one loses his own Rights or Privileges To determine what Rights fall under the negative Prescription by the Law of Nature it is obvious in the first Place That it is a legal Extinction of Rights of Property which go thereafter to the first Occupier  do  All Burdens upon the Person or Effects of another fall under it which operating an Extinction only not a Transference stand in Need of no positive Act of the Acquirer of his Liberty to produce the full Effect because if the Creditor's Right fall the Debitor cannot remain bound But as to all Acts of native Liberty personal Privileges  and such like which in benefiting ourselves interfeir not with others and make no Restraint upon them such cannot be lost by Disuse because they involve but the Idea of one Person and concern not others whereby supposing them capable to be cut off by Prescription still it would come to nothing because no Mortal could be founded in an Interest to alledge upon it the personal Objection of  jus tertii  would ever lie against him Thus if a Person shall keep Silence a hundred Year confine himself to a Place or to a certain Method of Action there is nothing in Nature to oblige him to continue a Moment in the same longer than he wills unless another by Use Consent or otherwise has acquired a Power over him to restrain his native Liberty 'Tis for the same Reason that a Man cannot tie himself down even by the most express Consent unless declared in Favours of some third Party Thus then Rights prescribe only negatively which involve the Consideration of two Persons But there is here a remarkable Limitation which makes a considerable further Restriction upon Rights prescribable which is That  personal Powers  or  Faculties  such as  Faculties to burden to alter  or  innovate to revoke  c though inferring a  Burden  upon others are not lost  non utendo  The true and adequate Reason whereof is this that it being involved in the very Idea of a  Faculty  to be exerced  quandocunque  at the arbitrary Pleasure of the Possessor as well now as afterwards as well afterwards as now  Neglect  or  Desertion  the Causes operative of Prescription can never be inferred simply from Forbearance In  Rights  the very Design of which is to be made effectual  quam primum  such as Obligations for Money or other Prestation Forbearance  to act upon these implies  Neglect  and  Dereliction  But where it is the very Intention of the Thing that the Matter should lie over where it is intirely arbitrary whether the  Power  be exerced this Day or hereafter the forbearing to act at present cannot infer in the Nature of Things  Neglect  or  Dereliction  These Limitations upon the negative Prescription  sciz  Acts of personal Liberty that imply but one Person and Faculties of the Nature to be exerced  quandocunque  are both of them generally comprehended under the Expression of  res merae facultatis  though very different in their Natures and carefully to be distinguished As for the  positive Prescription  all Rights may be acquired thereby that are capable of Possession  'Tis obvious that  positive Prescription  can in no Case exist without the  Negative  for it is through  Neglect  and  Dereliction  that the positive Prescription gives any Man Power over the Effects or Person of another But the negative Prescription may well subsist alone and work its whole Effect without Intervention of the positive Prescription Thus Property is lost negatively  non utendo  and if the Possessor has the positive Prescription it is a strong Confirmation of his Title but not absolutely necessary The proper Subjects therefore of the positive Prescription are  Servitudes personal  or  real  whereby Restraint is imposed upon Persons or their Effects which can by no Means be done by the negative Prescription alone  It was necessary to lay down the Principles of the Law of Nature relating to this Matter which will serve to guide us in the Ambiguities of our own Law as well as where it is totally deficient  Having explained the Doctrine of Prescription as founded in the Law of Nature Before we come closs to our own Practice it may be proper to premise that besides the above Considerations there are many others sufficient to have influenced our Lawgivers to introduce a Statute of this Nature Nothing more conduces to the Wellbeing of a Society than that private Property be fix'd and ascertained It tends to quiet the Minds of Possessors and encourages Industry which of all Things ought to be most cherished Besides it cuts off in a great Measure a Sort of Pleas pernicious above every Thing to Society  sciz  such as are the Result of Forgery Fraud and underhand Dealing Such Claims being generally laid over upon the Prospect that by Length of Time the proper Means of Discovery shall be evanish'd or the real Exceptions competent against them be forgot Taking then Prescription in all these different Views it is so far from being odious that perhaps there never was a Constitution better founded whether it be considered in the View of Equity or Expediency The Expediency is apparent The Equity is clearly shown above since the indulging of old forgotten Claims comes truly to this Making the Claimant  locupletior aliena jactura  And 'tis extremely curious to observe in this Case as well as in many others how common Sense and the Dictates of Nature get insensibly the better of false Principles imbib'd by Reading or Education In all our Authors it is held and allowed that Prescription is odious yet our Court of Session has been in the constant Use of extending rather than limiting the Statutes thereanent And at this Day as we shall see afterwards 'tis established in Practice that many  Things fall under Prescription which have no Sort of Warrant from the Acts of Parliament  Tho' Prescription be founded in the Law of Nature it must be observed that no precise Time is fixed to it by that Law This is in some Measure arbitrary left to the Regulation of every different Society for it self Our Law with great Judgment has fix'd upon forty Years A shorter Time might possibly have been reckon'd too great a Limitation upon Proprietors A longer Time was unnecessary for exceeding the ordinary Memory of Man in that Respect it is equivalent to the longest Duration And the Man who during such an Extent of Time neglects or overlooks his Affairs would probably reap little Benefit from a longer Indulgence  It does not appear that our Statutes or Practicks have much receded from the Law of Nature except in one particular Prescription of Rights of Property By the Law of Nature the negative Prescription is as effectual to cut a  Proprietor  out of his Right as a  Creditor  Yet without a positive Prescription since the Effect would be to make the Subject  caduciary  to go to the Fisk or first Occupier our Law favouring the  quondam  Proprietor allows him to take it up  quandocunque  as long as not appropriated by the positive Prescription And thus with us  "There is no such Thing as a negative Prescription of Rights of Property abstracted from the positive Prescription"  'Tis commonly held that in our Law  bona fides  is not a Requisite of the positive Prescription The Lord  Stair  says  "That in  Act  there is no Provision concerning the Manner of the Entry whether it be  bona fide  peaceable or lawful"  §  h t  If this be absolutely fixed in our  Practice there's an End of the Question If not the following Considerations may not be quite impertinent  mo  If  bona fides  is essential to the Nature of Prescription as has been fully laid down above it must ever be understood included unless where expresly excluded  do  In this very Act 'tis virtually if not expresly included For to what other End is a Title by Charter and Sasine made essential if not to establish a  bona fides  Let a Man examine seriously all the Reasons for Prescription political and legal and he shall not be able to point out any other View the Legislator could have in making a Title necessary to Prescription This will be more plain when we take a View of the  Roman  Law There a  justus titulus  abstracting from  bona fides  was reckoned a Requisite of the positive Prescription as much as it is with us Yet when we come to examine that Matter to the Bottom it will appear that  justus titulus  was truly no distinct Requisite of Prescription That it was only so far considered as to make Evidence of a  bona fides  and that where there was otherwise Presumption or Evidence of  bona fides  Prescription was sustain'd without any Title at all All this is clear from the Authority of  Africanus  one of the best  Roman  Writers  l    pro emptore  His Words are  Quod vulgo traditum est  Eum qui existimat se quid emisse nec emerit non posse pro emptore usucapere  Hactenus verum esse ait si nullam justam causam ejus erroris emptor habeat Nam si forte servus vel procurator cui emendam rem mandasset persuaserit ei se emisse atque ita tradiderit magis esse ut usucapio sequatur  To the same Purpose are  l    pro empt l ult  §  pro suo  And upon the same Footing it is that  one erroneously conceiving himself Heir prescribes a Right to the Heritage by  Addition  In this Case  usucapio  proceeds upon  bona fides  without any Colour of a Title See  Voet T pro heredere  § If then it come out that in the  Roman  Law the  justus titulus  is truly no distinct Requisite of Prescription more than it is in the Law of Nature Why should we go about to establish it as the only Principle when our Law says no such Thing to degrade the  bona fides  in Subserviency to which the  justus titulus  ought alone to be considered  tio  The Cases just now mentioned from the  Roman  Law without Controversy would equally obtain in our Practice The  Usucapio pro herede  particularly is established by express Statute  P    C  and the Prescription limited to Years Here then by Authority of Parliament we have the  bona fides  made the Foundation of Prescription without the least Pretence of a Title What can be answered to these Examples by those who hold that a Title is necessary and not  bona fides    to Bona fides  is absolutely necessary  ad lucrandos fructus perceptos ex re aliena  Would it not be absurd to adjudge the Property to a  mala fide  Possessor who at the same Time is in so unfavourable a Situation in the Eye of Law as even to be made accountable for the Fruits long ago consumed 'Tis a common Case to indemnify a Possessor as to the Rents who at the same Time is made to restore the Property So much less favourable is the one Claim than the other But it would be strange indeed to sustain a Title as sufficient to retain the Property which is not even sufficient to retain the Fruits already consum'd This last Argument I acknowledge appears to me in a very strong Light However if it  appear not so to others I shall be the less surprised in that they have a Support from the  Roman  Law See  l  §  A R D  This Text and others to the same Purpose would stagger me extremely were it not in my Opinion an Argument of as great Weakness on the one Hand to give implicite Faith to any human Authority as on the other wantonly to neglect or contemn all human Authority Sure I am the cool and diligent Enquirer who in Search after Truth uses his own Reason and the Lights that Nature has afforded him is more to be commended and offers a more agreeable Incense to the Memory of the great Men who write upon the  Roman  Law tho' in his Judgment he may sometimes argue them of little Slips and Errors than the abject Mind does which blindly follows whereever they chuse to lead So much was necessary by Way of Apology for venturing to set up private Judgment against publick and indeed generally speaking so well founded Authority But to return to my Subject  Here we have a notable Difference in our Law betwixt the negative and positive Prescription  Bona fides  is necessary in the one not at all in the other Obligations are lost merely by Disuse and Dereliction without Necessity of alledging a  bona fides  in the Debitor or any Thing similar to a positive Prescription of Liberty For tho' the former Proprietor is restored against the Fisk the Creditor is not restored against his Debitor because  Liberation  is as much more favourable than  Obligation  as private Property is more favourable than Confiscation This explains the Decision  Fountainhall  th  December    Napier  contra  Campbell  where it was found That after the Years Prescription  the Defender was not obliged to give his Oath whether the Debt was yet resting owing and tho' he should confess it that he was not in  foro humano  liable Possibly it were to be wish'd we had deviated from the Law of Nature in the negative Prescription of  Obligations  as far as we have done in the negative Prescription of  Property Bona fides  is absolutely requisite in the Acquisition of Property by Prescription without which the former Proprietor is not cut out by whatever Disuse Might it not be thought as reasonable that the Debitor should not be restored to his Liberty unless by a  quasi  Possession of Exemption upon a  bona fide  colourable Title And were this made the Rule the negative Prescription would be as strongly founded in Equity as it is in strict Law 'Tis a great Hardship to oblige a Man to pay a Debt he never was conscious of having absolute Affection and Security upon the Side of Freedom 'Tis no Hardship to refuse Action to a Creditor who had perhaps never considered himself as such and never built Hope in the Claim And thus the Rule of Equity might apply here as well as in the positive Prescription  sciz Quod nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura  Hitherto I say we have thought proper to adhere strictly to the Law of Nature The Alteration here offered may possibly obtain Footing in our Practice  The positive Prescription may be defined  A legal Acquisition of Property or Servitude by Means of a forty Years  bona fide  Possession  qua  Proprietor or  qua  having a Right to the Servitude Join'd with a total Disuse or Neglect of the righteous Owner during that Time  The negative Prescription is  A legal Extinction of the Creditor's Interest by  Means of a total Disuse or Dereliction for forty Years  Every temporary Extinction of a Right is not Prescription That is only understood to be Prescription which extinguishes Rights design'd by the Law or Consent to endure a longer Time Thus the  annus deliberandi  the three Years Preference given the Creditors of the Defunct the Legal of Adjudications and such like fall not within the Compass of this Essay  The negative Prescription is not a  real  Extinction like Payment but only a  personal  Exclusion of the Pursuer being an  extrinsick  not  intrinsick  Exception This is plain from its Nature being directed against the Pursuer's Negligence and therefore can only amount to a  personal  Exception against him Thus in an Adjudication or other Right disponed to two different Persons one after another the negative Prescription may run against one of them tho' the Adjudication it self be saved from Prescription by the other Disponee  November    Fraser  contra  Mackenzie  Upon this Principle depends the Resolution of the following Questions An unintimate Assignation lies over Years Prescription has run against the Cedent but interrupted  quoad  the Assigny by Minority Has the Assigny thereafter intimating a good Title  R D  The Debt was  funditus  extinguished in the Person of the Cedent  Ans  Prescription is only an  extrinsick  Exception denying Action to the Cedent but leaving the Debt intire to be made effectual by the Assigny  The like as to a Disposition upon Deathbed of an heritable Debt which is lost as to the Disponee by the Lapse of Years The Heir with respect  to whom the Prescription was interrupted by Minority or otherwise has a good Action against the Debitor notwithstanding the Debt is prescribed  quoad  the Disponee  The same Principle determines the Question as to the Prescription of  accessory  or  cautionary  Obligements Here we must distinguish betwixt an additional Security strictly  accessory  or  subsidiary  and an  expromissory  Security  i e  the acceding of a new  principal  Obligant In the first Case because such strictly accessory Obligements can have no Selfsubsistence by whatever Means the  principal  Obligation is cut off its Shadow the  Accessory  falls of Course But when several Coobligants bind at different Times for the same Debt every several Coobligant will be free by a several Course of Prescription for Prescription is not like Payment an Extinction of the Debt it self operating only an  extrinsick  Exception  personal  against the Pursuer  From this Principle it also follows That Prescription is not of the Nature of a  Presumption  inferring that the Debt is extinguished by Payment or otherwise which some hold For in the above Example  Fraser  contra  Mackenzie  if the Adjudication were presum'd extinguished by Payment or Intromission in the first Disponer's Person this would necessarily affect the second Disponee because an Adjudication extinguished by Payment in one Assigny's Person cannot subsist in the Person of any other There is a second Argument to evince this Prescription has such an Effect against the Pursuer's Claim that it cannot thereafter be reared up by the Debitor's Oath of Knowledge that it is still resting owing Does not this evince That Prescription is not a Presumption at all whether  juris de  jure  or  juris  only For 'tis obvious That every legal Presumption however strong must yield to a demonstrative Proof by the Debitor's Oath There is some better Colour for putting the positive Prescription upon the Footing of a  Presumption  The Narrative of the Act seems to favour this But as Prescription is supported by the Law of Nature it has a more solid Fundation than a  Presumption  a Creature of the Law in this Case no better than a Fiction  It goes next in order to consider what Things fall under the negative Prescription  mo  It is plain from the two Statutes  P    C  and  C  joined with the Nature of Prescription above laid down that all Burdens established against  Persons  or  Things  prescribe  non utendo  such as Obligations mutual Contracts Infeftments of Annualrents Wadsets Servitudes Dispositions Adjudications c All of which include the  Idea  of two Persons one who loses his Right and another who is thereby freed from a Claim or Burden In a Question upon this Head it was found sufficient to exempt the Defender's Lands from the Jurisdiction of a Regality that he had been free for the Space of Years never being inrolled or cited by the Bailie but still by the Sheriff  Stair    November    Rolland  contra Laird of  Craigievar  It was also found That the Power of Repledging from one Court to another was lost  non utendo  by the negative Prescription  Fountainhall    January  Justices of the Peace of the Shire of  Air  contra Town of  Irvine    do  Rights of Property suffer not the negative Prescription  December  Presbytery of  Perth  contra  the Magistrates of  Perth    tio  Acts and Exertions of native Liberty which make no Burden or Restraint upon others including only one Person who has the Power but none other against whom it is directed none of these suffer the negative Prescription And if they did it would be  jus tertii  to found upon it Thus the Right of Blood never prescribes 'Tis true that if another than the righteous Heir serve the Law makes his Retour irreducible after Years But abstracting from the positive Prescription the righteous Heir may serve  quandocunque  no Mortal can be founded in an Interest to make Opposition  to  Powers and Faculties of the Nature to be exerced  quandocunque  Such as Faculties to dispone burden alter revoke c Thus Reversions suffer not the negative Prescription 'Tis involved in the very Nature of such to ly over The Man cannot be accused of Negligence who wadset his Lands Yesterday for not redeeming them to Day or to Morrow To oblige him to redeem them presently under the Hazard of Prescription would be going directly contrary to the Nature and Design of the Contract Yet this seems to be laid down Parliament  Cap  Unless it be referred to the positive Prescription which Interpretation is founded both in the Nature of the Thing and in the Act it self For if Reversions be registred or incorporated within the Body of the Infeftment the Act in this Case says they never can prescribe Now it appears obvious That this does only relate to the positive Prescription There is good Reason that Reversions incorporated or registred should be good against the positive Prescription and the same Reason will infer that latent Reversions ought not But no  good Reason can be given if latent Reversions prescribe negatively why they should not also tho' made ever so publick Neglect and Dereliction are the Foundations of the negative Prescription and they must hold equally in both Cases to infer the negative Preicription or they must hold in neither which is the more rational Scheme  For the same Reason a Donation betwixt Man and Wife may be revoked at any Time and the Power of Revocation suffers not the negative Prescription  Fountainhall    January    Turnbul  contra  Husband  Upon the same Footing it is That the Power to take Infeftment upon a Precept is not lost by Delay which while the Party is in Possession of the Lands or Superiority thereof may  ad libitum  be done  quandocunque    July    Johnston  of  Corhead  contra  Johnston  of  Newtoun  In mutual Contracts Prescription can have no such Effect as to liberate the one Party while the other remains bound If the one demand Performance he must fulfil also his Part Because Prescription does not change the Nature of Contracts by transforming them into other Species it cuts them off simply or allows them to stand simply Now as the Nature of a mutual Contract is  one  and  indivisible  to oblige the one Party to perform while the other is free would be intirely to change its Nature by transforming it into a  simple  Obligation which Prescription cannot do being made to  destroy  not to  establish  Obligations Thus in a Contract of Sale for Example which has lien over Years without Implement but keeped alive by the one Party thro' Minority or Interruption if the Party against whom Prescription has not run insist for Implement he must at the same Time perform the  mutual Cause because if he pursue upon the Contract he must take it as it stands But then the Prescription has this Effect that the other Party cannot pursue upon it because as to him it is lost  non utendo  And thus Prescription may run against one Party in a mutual Contract and not against the other but never so as to divide the Prestations the Contract must be fulfilled  in totum  or not at all  'Tis commonly held That a Right of Peerage does not suffer the negative Prescription But of this there may be a Doubt It cannot be put upon the Footing of a  personal Quality  such a one as no Person has an Interest to object Prescription against because the first Peer being removed the second in order attains the first Place 'Tis true Peerage is not a Burden upon any Person or Thing but neither is Property and yet by the Law of Nature it suffers the negative Prescription Our Law indeed  in favorem  restores the former Proprietor to his Right but that Favour cannot be pled in this Case more than in that of a Creditor There is no Reason for restoring one Peer against another more than for restoring a Creditor against his Debitor It cannot be put upon the Footing of a  Faculty  to be exerced  quandocunque  A Right of Peerage is of the Nature to be capable of Neglect and Dereliction as well as a Right of Property or of Credit  Lastly  Tho'  jus sanguinis  prescribes not which might be reckoned of the same Nature with this in Question that holds only where it is  jus tertii  for any Mortal to make the Objection no Person having an Interest to hinder an Heir to represent whomever of his Prdecessors If the Right taken up by the Heir be of the Nature of an Obligation the  quondam  Debitor suffers nothing because he is  already free by the negative Prescription if a Right of Property the present Possessor is safe by the positive Prescription and if that be not run the Heir has Access upon a separate  medium  to wit That Property prescribes not negatively if it be a personal Faculty that interfeirs not with others or if it be of that Nature to be exerced  quandocunque  there is nothing to hinder the Heir to take it up Now this applies not to a Right of Peerage the Prescription of which third Parties have Interest in equally as where the Prescription is of Obligations  Reduction upon the Head of Deathbed was found to suffer the negative Prescription  Forbes    March    Murray  contra  Irving  But in that Decision Mention is not made of what Nature was the Subject disponed upon Death bed If it was an heritable Bond there can be no Question about the Decision for this Reason that the Heir could have no Interest to pursue such a Reduction against the Disponee whose Right against the Debitor himself was cut off  non utendo  And if the Disponee took a Document upon the Right and saved it from Prescription that cannot benefit the Heir but if the Heir himself used Interruption there is a Difficulty which resolves into this Whether a Deathbed Deed be  ipso jure  null or good until it be challenged by Reduction If the last the Reduction prescribes  non utendo  If the other the Subject remained  in haereditate jacente  and there could be no Necessity of a Reduction If now the Disposition upon Deathbed was of Lands the same Distinction must be taken along for upon Supposition the Deathbed Deed was good until Reduction it follows That the Reduction is cut off by the negative Prescription if null as a Right of Property  prescribes not  non utendo  the Heir may take it up when he will  The negative Prescription of annual Prestations is a Subject abstruse in itself and not at all clear'd by Writers or Decisions To avoid the Labyrinth these naturally lead us into it will be the best Way to abstract from them for the present and endeavour to draw our Conclusions from well founded Principles To begin we ought nicely to distinguish amongst four Things  mo  The Contract or other legal Deed which is the  Cause  and whereby the Right is established  do  The Writing which is the  Evidence    tio  The  Right  it self established  to  The Consequences of the Right For Example in a Loan of Money the Fact of Delivery of the Sum lent to the Debitor with his Consent to repay is the  Cause  The BOnd is the  Evidence  There is a  Right of Credit  established the Consequences are  mo  A Power to oblige the Debitor to repay the Sum  quandocunque    do  A Power to oblige him to pay Annualrent in the mean Time Of these four 'tis the Right itself that is the proper Subject of Prescription 'Tis obvious that  Consent  or  Evidence  are not capable of Prescription And as for the  Consequences  of the Right if the  Right  itself remain firm and unshaken its Consequences are a Shadow that must ever attend the Substance If the Right itself fall 'tis bootless to talk whether the Consequences be prescribed since a Shadow cannot exist without the Substance Having gained this Point that the  Right  itself is the proper Subject of Prescription let us now put the Case of a Sum of Money lent repayable at two different Terms the Creditor in  sts for Payment forty Years after the first Term's  Payment fell due but within forty Years of the second Term  Quaeritur  Whether the remaining Half that fell due the second Term can yet be exacted The Answer is That it cannot because the  Right  itself the  jus crediti  is cut off by Prescription after which there can be no Pursuit upon the Bond The Creditor has been negligent for the Space of forty Years since the Time that Action was first competent thereupon the Law from this infers that he has derelinquished his Right which brings him to the same Situation as it never had been granted the Right itself falls with all its Consequences Upon the same Medium it is that a Bond bearing Annualrent having lien over forty Years not only the principal Sum but all the intermediate Annualrents fall to the Ground tho' none of them have been due forty Years and possibly some of them not a single Month Thus the Matter was determined in the  Roman  Law and upon the same Principles See  L    C de Usur  The Words are  Eos qui principali actione per exceptionem triginta vel quadraginta annorum sive personali sive hypothecaria ceciderunt jubemus non posse super usuris vel fructibus praeteriti temporis aliquam movere quaestionem dicendo ex iisdem temporibus eas velle sibi persolvi quae non ad triginta vel quadraginta praeteritos annos referuntur asserendo singulis annis earum actiones nasci  principali  enim actione non subsistente satis supervacuum est super usuris vel fructibus adbuc judicem cognoscere  From the same Principle it flows that if a Creditor take Document upon his Right the  Right  itself is safe from Prescription with all its  Consequences  which is insinuated in the first Act anent Prescription and cleared by Practice Thus negative  Prescription is saved as to the whole the Creditor doing Diligence against any one of the Principals or Cautioners  Stair Dirleton    th December    Nicolson  contra Laird of  Philorth Forbes    d February  Earl of  Marchmount  contra  Home  Thus in an Infeftment of Annualrent reaching two Tenements Diligence done against the one or Payment made by the Debitor saves Prescription as to both which was found though the Annualrent was constitute upon the two Tenements by two different Sasines  Stair Gosford    d June  Lord  Balmerino  contra  Hamilton  The like in a Thirlage of  omnia grana crescentia  established by Writ where it was found That the Defender having grinded a Part of his Corns at the Mill to which he was thi  ed this was sufficient to support the Astriction for the whole tho' there was a Desuetude as to some Particulars comprehended in the Writ above the Space of forty Years  Durie    June  Laird of  Waughton  contra  Home  All which tend to shew that there is no such Thing as a distinct Prescription of the  Consequences  different from that of the  Right  itself All tends to this Point  "The Right itself falling it falls with all its Consequences the Right itself being supported it is supported with all its Consequences"  It follows also as a plain Consequence of the same Principle That if a Creditor take Document upon his Bond by receiving Payment of any Year's Annualrent or any Part of the principal Sum this must be a good Interruption not only as to the principal Sum itself but as to all preceeding Annualrents because the Right is thereby supported which supports all its Consequences And so it was determined  Stair    July    Blair  contra  Blair  This Decision indeed was thereafter altered  th February    inter eosdem  and the quite contrary found Upon this reasoning that though Payment either of the Principal or Annualrent does interrupt Prescription of a Bond as to the principal Sum yet the Annualrent being  annua praestatio  every Year does infer a distinct Obligation and every distinct Year's Annualrent does prescribe by forty Years Silence So that the Payment of the subsequent Annualrent or a Part of the Principal does not interrupt the Prescription of any single bygone Year's Annualrent if there was no Pursuit upon that Year's Annualrent during the Course of Prescription I cannot persuade myself that this is just Reasoning The Error seems to lie here that every Year's Annualrent is considered as a distinct  principal  Obligation not  depending  upon or  consequential  to the Right whereby the principal Sum is established whereas it is as direct a  Consequence  of the Right of Credit as the Penalty is or any other  accessory  Stipulation To try this reasoning let us examine where it will carry us The Obligation for Annualrent is a distinct  principal  Obligation therefore it is not interrupted by Document taken upon the Right for the principal Sum Therefore  do  Of necessary Consequence it prescribes not with the principal Sum but has its own separate Prescription And so though a Bond be cut off by a forty Years Negligence all the Annualrents within the forty Years may yet be demanded expresly contrary to the above Text of the Civil Law founded in the most solid Principles To sum up this Dispute the whole comes here if Annualrent be a distinct  principal independent  Obligation it must have a separate Prescription from that of the principal Sum whereby the principal Sum may be prescribed while the bygone  Annualrents remain due and Prescription of the principal Sum may be interrupted without interrupting the other If Annualrent be an  Accessory  a  Consequence  depending upon and flowing from the  jus crediti  established by the Bond and Contract in the Pursuer's Person which it unquestionably is both the above Positions must be wrong Prescription of the one must cut off the other and Interruption of the one support the other equally as in the Case of Infeftment of Annualrent established over two Tenements or against two Debitors and yet Payment by one Debitor or out of one Tenement is just as distinct a Prestation from the Payment made by the other Debitor or out of the other Tenement as the Prestation of Annualrent is distinct from that of the principal Sum or Penalty  Having premised these Principles it is Time now to take a View of the Decisions relative to this Point And  mo  A Liferentrix having lived many Years after her Husband's Decease without demanding her Annuity in an Action at her Representative's Instance for the Annuities falling due within the Years of Prescription The Lords found That there being no Action intented for Payment of the Liferent for forty Years after the Husband's Decease the RIGHT of Liferent and the Pursuer's Claim thereupon was prescribed  Forbes    th July    Steuart  contra the Children of  Cuming  of  Pitoullie  But in a simular Case of a Bond of Pension granted to an Advocate the Bond had lien over forty Years without any Thing done upon it yet the bygone Pensions falling due within the Years of Prescription were decerned to be paid to the Creditors Representative upon this Footing that every Year's Pension was a separate Obligation  and run a different Course of Prescription  July    Lockhart  contra Duke of  Gordon  These two Decisions hang not well together The first seems to be well founded There is also a Text in the  Roman  Law which runs counter to our Doctrine it is  L  §  C de Praescript    vel    ann In his etiam promissionibus vel legatis vel aliis obligationibus quae dationem per singulos annos vel menses aut aliquod singulare tempus continent tempora memoratorum praescriptionum non ab exordio talis obligationis sed ab initio cujusque anni vel mensis vel alterius singularis temporis computari manifestum est  The Mistake with Submission seems still to lie here that every Term's Prestation is considered as a distinct  principal independent  Right equally as if granted by different Persons at different Times in different Deeds which is plainly a wrong Conception of the Matter All these different Prestations are the Effects of one CAUSE  sciz  the Right established in the Creditors Person by the Legacy Promise or other legal Deed The Right here is as much  unicum individuum  as any that contains but one single Prestation The Unity of the Right depends upon the Unity of the Contract Where the Deed is one which it always must be when done  unico contextu  by a single Act of the binding Faculty the Right established thereby must be simple and one though complex in its Performance For Example An Obligation to pay ten Pound is one simple Obligation though it may be implemented by distinct Performances of partial Payments 'Tis the same though the Performance be stipulated originally to be at different Times such as a Stipulation for Annualrent or other annual Prestation which Difference of Time in the Performance  does no more infer different or distinct Obligations than the Obligation to build a House which must necessarily take up Time in the Performance or any Right of Servitude such as common Pasturage all of which are performed successively in Time and yet are  funditus  cut off by the Disuse of bare forty Years Let us further illustrate this Matter by the Consideration of a Tack which though containing mutual and different Prestations both as to Kind and Time is yet one Contract one Right in the Contracters The Matter then comes here if the Right itself be cut off by Prescription  sciz  the Legacy or Contract the annual Prestations flowing therefrom and depending upon it must cease of Consequence  To sift this Matter to the Bottom being of Importance let us examine what further may be said in Favours of this Distinction betwixt the Prescription of Annualrents and other yearly Prestations inferred from comparing these two Laws of the  Codex  together If it be contended to ly here that the  principal  Sum falling the  accessory  Annualrent cannot stand whereas in other annual Prestations there is no  principal  Obligation to which they may be referred as  Accessories  but each Prestation is a separate  Principal  The Answer is It is true that after the  principal  Sum is extinguished no Annualrents can begin to exist But as to the Annualrents due before the Prescription run out there is no such Connection as to infer that they must fall because the  Principal  falls The solid Reason is that there is a  Right  in the Creditor antecedent in the Order of our Ideas to the respective Claims of both  Principal  and Annualrent from which  Right  these Claims flow are  Consequences of and depend upon To  claim  is to  act  and all legal Action presupposes a  Right  in the Actor which makes it legal 'Tis this  Right  which suffers the negative Prescription and it being done away there is nothing left to support a Claim either for Principal or Annualrent The very same Way in other annual Prestations a Bond of Pension for Example there is an antecedent  Right  that supports every respective Year's Claim which being extinguished these Claims must all fall at once If it be alledged That every Year's Claim arises from a separate independent Right which arises annually let it be considered that Time alone cannot make a  Right  to exist If it did not exist before it cannot begin now by the Force of Time alone The Pension is  one  arising from  one  Consent one Act of the binding Faculty Even as much as a Right to a Sum bearing Annualrent is  one  or a Right of Pasturage or to oblige a Person  ad factum prestandum  which requires a Course of Time to Performance Or even as a Right of Property which involves many Powers and Prestations differing in Kind as well as Time To show that a Bond of Pension is one Right tho' containing the Performance of many Years Let us consider the Difference betwixt that Case and a different Bond for every Year's Pension renewed annually In the last Case a Right arises and falls every Year and all the different Bonds are quite independent and unconnected whereas in the other Case a Right arose upon Subscription of the Bond which subsisted equally and uniformly through all the Years it was designed to last and fell not until running out of the last Year  do  If such a Pension be not allowed to be one Right it  will be difficult to show that one Year's Pension is one Right which is equally divisible as Years are into Months and Days and so on to  infinitum  To fortify this let us apply to the natural Notions of Mankind whether they are not apt to consider a Right obtained by one Consent in one Deed as  one  Whether of judging of one's own Neglect he does not take it from forbearing to pursue upon the  Deed  the  Contract  without dreaming to distinguish the particular Prestations therein  Thus as to the negative Prescription of annual Prestations these two Conclusions appear to be well founded  mo  That the  Right  itself falling by Prescription it must fall with all its  Accessories  and  Consequences    do  That any Document taken upon the Right according to Act  C  as it does preserve the  Right  itself so of Necessity it must preserve all the  Accessories  and  Consequences  Hitherto of annual Prestations where the Right itself is prescribable There remains still behind another Branch to be discussed  sciz  where the  Right  itself is not prescribable which is the noted Case of Teind Feuduty c In this Case tho' the Right itself fall not by Disuse or Dereliction yet it is our constant Practice to cut down the Bygones preceeding Years Thus I say stands our Law but if one shall go accurately to inquire into the Reason it will not be found so obvious The Footing I apprehend it is generally taken upon is That every Year's Prestation is a  different  Right which of Consequence must have a  different  Course of Prescription But this I acknowledge I never could conceive and that it is a wrong Conception  of the Matter is pretty fully explained above 'Tis obvious in all such Cases tho' the Prestations arise annually yet there must be a  Right  antecedent in the Order of our Ideas which supports each of these Prestations and upon which each Year's Claim is founded which  Right  is as much  unicum individuum  as any Right can be that supports but one single Performance To take a closer View of this in the Matter of Teinds in which indeed every Year's Prestation bids as fair for being a  distinct Right  as any one that can be exemplified 'Tis obvious in the first Place That VicarageTeind has never been taken upon that Footing otherwise it could never suffer a total negative Prescription which it unquestionably does And 'tis plain that ParsonageTeind is as much  jus unicum individuum  as Vicarage  do  ParsonageTeind is apparently considered as  jus unicum individuum  without which it could never be carried by the positive Prescription Were it otherwise Possession of ParsonageTeinds for Years might well exclude a Demand for Bygones upon the Footing that the  Fructus  are  bona fide percepti consumpti  but could give no Right for Time to come because no Right can be carried by Prescription but that individually upon which the Possession was founded The Conclusion of all is That if a Right to ParsonageTeinds be a  jus unicum individuum  Prescription must run against it totally or not at all If the Right fall it must fall with its Consequences if it stand it must stand with its Consequences  After the same Manner the Right to Feuduties is  jus unicum individuum  The Right itself can never prescribe being inherent in the Superiority which again being a Right to Lands can never suffer  the negative Prescription The like of Tackduties which are constituted in one Contract established by one Consent one Bargain  'Tis extremly true that in these Examples there has been Neglect Disuse and Dereliction all that is necessary in the common Cases to found the negative Prescription But  quid inde  To say that the negative Prescription in any particular Case runs not is in other Words to say That the Law restores him against his Neglect Disuse and Dereliction therefore the personal Objection of Prescription lies not against him Therefore he can insist upon his Right  quandocunque  And if he can insist upon his Right he can insist upon it as it stands and as it stood from the Beginning For Prescription alters not the Nature of Rights transforms them not into other Shapes it cuts them down simply or allows them to stand simply Thus in the Case of Feuduty since the Right of Superiority prescribes not neither can the Claim for the Feuduties whether against the Vassal or against the Ground which Claim is  inherent  in the Superiority essential to it and therefore not to be divided from it  If now the Matter be put upon this Footing  "That by the Law of Nature all Sorts of Rights fall by the negative Prescription and among the rest Right to Lands and Teinds and that our Law when it restores Proprietors against this Prescription does it not totally but only as to Bygones within Years and in Time to come"  The Difficulty is  mo  That this is but an arbitrary Scheme For taking the Thing in this View it appears more reasonable that the Prescription should be allowed to run with Respect to the whole Bygones  from the present Time For truly the Neglect and Dereliction would infer so much equally as in the Case of a Bond bearing Annualrent in which the Annualrents within Years fall by Prescription as well as the Bond itself And when we take a View of the Reason why Right to Lands falls not by Prescription the Objection will appear in a stronger Light A Man by our Law is restor'd to his Property where it is not acquir'd to another by positive Prescription because the former Proprietor is in a more favourable Case than the Fisk or first Occupier But there is no Reason he should be restor'd to Bygones seeing Liberation is more favourable than Obligation especially taking along that Neglect on the one Side without  bona fides  on the other is sufficient in the negative Prescription If then this Scheme come out to any Thing it must come out thus That Property in Lands is lost by the negative Prescription as well as other Rights whereby all its Consequences and Accessories fall of Course But that our Law  ob favorem  gives back the Property as by a  new  Right unless it has been acquir'd to another by Prescription  do  There is another strong Objection against the Scheme which cuts off the Bygones only preceeding Years Which is That as the Law is supposed to restore the Proprietor to the Bygones within Years because of his Neglect with Respect to these of an older Date It must follow that if he has purged his Neglect by uplifting any Year's Duty within the Years such a Document taken upon his Right must be an Interruption even as to Bygones for Years preceeding the Date thereof Now this will scarce be allowed the contrary is the received Scheme  sciz  That every Year's Prestation runs a distinct Course of Prescription and therefore that the uplifting of one Year's Duty will not save another  Considering this Matter in all its different Lights the most rational Footing it can be put upon seems to be that the refusing Action upon annual Prestations preceeding Years does not at all arise from Prescription but from a quite different Foundation The Law introduces a  Presumption  that every Man will demand what is due to him at least within Years and that if he delays longer it is because Payment has already been made I am the more satisfied with this from what I see in  Durie  th  December  Laird of  Gairntully  contra Commissary of St  Andrews  "Where a Feuduty being demanded after Years it was found That this being a Debt owing by the Defender's own Cha  er he could not propone  Prescription  against the  ame But the Lords thought it expedient that the Pursuer should restrict his Libel to the Feuduties arising within the last Years"  If this Scheme hold it will follow that the Pursuer has Access in this Case to refer to the Defender's Oath that the Duties even preceeding the Years are still resting owing Which as above set forth he has no Access to do in the proper Prescription And thus Prescription in Cases of this Kind is precisely of the same Nature with the quinquennial Prescription of Tackduties c and triennial Prescription of Merchant Accompts c none of which truly are of the Nature of the proper Prescription They found not a personal Objection against the Pursuer upon the  Medium  of Neglect or Dereliction They are nothing else but a  Presumption  introduc'd by Law that the Debt is satisfied  which has this Effect to throw the  onus probandi  upon the Pursuer that the Debt is still resting owing  Thus far upon the Question with Relation to Rights that fall not by Prescription whether at least they should not fall as to Bygones preceeding forty Years We proceed now to another Question with Relation to Teinds in particular Why they should not fall totally by the negative Prescription It is laid down by Lord  Stair  in his Institutions §  hujus tituli That a Right to Teinds may be prescribed as well as other Rights by forty Years Possession but that a Right to bygone Teinds being founded in publick Law prescribes not except as to Bygones before forty Years  Thus in our Law Teinds are subject to the  positive  but not  negative  Prescription Yet it must be acknowledged that the Reason given here for the Difference is not quite satis ying All Rights are founded in publick Law as well as Teinds besides that publick Law has no more Relation to the  negative  than  positive  Prescription To take this Matter from the Beginning 'tis obvious that before the Reformation while Teinds were the Patrimony of the Church and not alienable they were in no View prescriptable as being  extra commercium  just as much as the  res sacrae sanctae religiosae  among the  Romans  But the Case differed after the Abolition of  Popery  Teinds continuing no longer the Patrimony of the Church they were erected into temporal Lordships gifted away to particular Persons and now plainly  in commercio  'Tis true they continue still burdened with a competent Provision to Ministers So far as that  Burden goes they are still  extra commercium  and consequently not prescriptable But as for the Interest the Laity have in Teinds 'tis perhaps not easy to account why that Interest should not suffer the  negative  as well as  positive  Prescription Let us suppose the Case that a Person who is Titular of his own Teinds disposes upon the same by Way of Sale the Purchaser forbears during forty Years to insist upon his Contract it does not appear why the Contract should not fall by Prescription and of Consequence the Right to the Teindduties Nor is it any Way repugnant that the same Teinds should yet continue to be a subsisting Subject liable to the Burden of the Ministers Stipend because as above laid down Prescription gives only an  exstrinsick  Exception against the Pursuer claiming but operates not an Extinction of the Right claimed I have formerly thought that Teind is a Landright and therefore suffers not the negative Prescription But this is not just Teinds are a  Burden  upon Land just as an Infeftment of Annualrent is And if the negative Prescription should take Place the Consequence would be a  Liberation  only not a  Transference  of Property Were a Right to Teinds to be considered not as a  jus unicum individuum  but a separate  principal independent  Right as to every distinct Years Teindduty the Matter would be expedite But this is not so as is endeavoured to be made out above And truly after all since a Right to Teinds is acquirable by Prescription which supposes it a  jus unicum individuum  it appears a fair Consequence that it should be lost the same Way  As to the negative Prescription of Viccarageteinds there is a remarkable Decision observed by  Fountainhall    July  Laird of  Grant  contra  M'Intosh  where it is held  "That Viccarage of Lint Hemp Milk c does totally prescribe  non utendo  for forty Years which holds true in general with Respect to all Species except Calves Lambs and Wool And the Reason given for the Exception is because these commonly pay Viccarage in all Places and therefore as to these Cessation of Payment liberates only from all Years above forty"  The Author adds  "That the same had been found before Earl of  Panmuir  and the Heritors of  Inverness  as also the Parson of  Prestonhaugh  and his Parishioners And as to Roots it was then lately decided between  Gib  in  SuttiesMyre  in  Aberdeen  and  Burnet  where Roots and Herbs were found not liable in Viccarage unless they had been in Use of paying the Teind within these forty Years And on the  June  Minister of  Elgin  contra his Parishioners The Lords found That Yards in  Elgin  belonging to the Canons of old should not pay Viccarige because free forty Years back and past all Memory unless he would prove Payment either out of thir or any other the Canons Portions within that Time to the Church"  This Decision seems to introduce a Distinction amongst the different Species that pay Viccarage Teind  sciz ordinary  such as Calves Lambs and Wool which prescribe not  extraordinary  containing all the other Species which do prescribe If this hold it must be taken in a limited Sense what is laid down by Lord  Stair Tit Teinds  §  sciz That Viccarageteinds are local according to the Custom of the Benefice or Parish  And thus Subjects that  ordinarily  pay Viccarage are upon the same Footing  with Parsonageteinds neither of them subject to the negative Prescription  Discharges and Liberations are not capable of the negative Prescription they relate not to the Constitution of a Right but to the ultimate Conclusion and Performance thereof they cannot therefore be lost  non utendo  because not design'd to have any further Operation Thus Decreets of Valuation and Sale of Teinds prescribe not  Fountainhall Forbes  th  June  Lady  Cardross  contra  Graham  because such Decreets are not an  Establishment  of a Right of Teinds but a  Liberation  therefrom And in mutual Declarators of Thirlage and Immunity the one founding on an old Charter the other on a posterior Contract giving Power to the Party whose Lands had been thirled by the Charter to build a Mill on his own Ground it was found That tho' he had not built any for upwards of a Years yet this  Liberty  was not lost by Prescription  Fountainhall Forbes  th  March  Laird  Newmains  contra Laird of  Bimerside  As to Exceptions which are reckon'd perpetual according to the Brocard  Temporaneae ad agendum sunt perpetua ad excipiendum  the following Distinction will clear the Matter If the Exception be founded upon some Right in the Defender's Person it can last no longer than the Right subsists but if founded upon  Discharges Liberations  or such like it must be perpetual thus the Exception of Payment can never prescribe because it is a  Liberation  But Compensation does prescribe with the Defender's Claim upon which it is founded for there can be no Compensation after the Debt is extinguished by Payment or Prescription In this View I cannot  tell if the Decision  Forbes  th  June    Sinclair  contra  Murray  be well founded The Case was in an Action of Count and Reckoning the Defender proponed Compensation upon two Receipts in which the Pursuer acknowledged the Receipt of Money from the Defender and obliged himself to allow the same at Counting Replied for the Pursuer The Receipts are prescribed It was answered That Discharges or Receipts affording Ground of Defence only and which the Receiver cannot found upon till he be pursued are  perpetua ad excipiendum  and cannot prescribe which was found relevant  Prescription tho' not an intrinsick or real Exception is of that Sort of personal Exceptions which are drawn from the Circumstances of the Pursuer denying him the  jus agendi  For this Reason it may not only be pled upon by the Debitor himself who is liberate thereby but by all others having Interest in the Question And thus in a Competition betwixt two Assignies to an Adjudication the second Assigny was allowed to propone Prescription against the first Assigny whereby his came to be the preferable Right  November  Mr  Alexander Fraser  contra  Hector Mackenzie  Of the positive Prescription  A habile Title ever presumes  bona fides  without examining into the Right of the Disponer providing only there be any Room for the Supposition that the Subject possibly might have been his Thus forty Years Possession with a Title from a Subject was found sufficient to establish a Fair tho'  the King alone can constitute Fairs it being a possible Supposition that the Right was originally derived from the King to the Disponer  Stair  d  December    Farquharson  contra Earl of  Aboyn  And a Bishop's Charter disposing of a Salmonfishing with forty Years Possession was sustain'd as a good Right notwithstanding that Salmonfishing is  inter regalia  because the Bishop might have got a Grant from the King  Stair    th January    Brown  contra Town of  Kirkcudbright  By the  Roman  Law the Author's Possession acceded to that of the singular Successor to compleat  usucapion  providing the Author was in  bona fide  See  Voet H T  § But in my Opinion tho' to the positive Prescription a continued  bona fides  is necessary yet there ought to be an Exception in the Case of a  bona fide  Purchaser who should be allowed to reckon upon his Author's Possession tho' it be found afterward that he has been  in mala fide  and could not acquire to himself by Prescription The Reason is that Dereliction is sufficient to cut off the former Proprietor and the present Possessor who has bought  bona fide  is in as favourable Situation as if his Author had been also a  bona fide  Possessor and consequently ought reasonably to be prefer'd to the former Proprietor and much more to the King or first Occupier  As to the Title necessary in the positive Prescription found That Sasines upon Hasp and Staple having no other Warrant but the Clerk of the Burgh his Assertion are not a sufficient Title for Prescription as not contained in the Act of Parliament which mentions Sasines upon Retours Charters and Precepts of  Clareconstat  but no  Word of Hasp and Staple so that Acts of Parliament being  strictissimi juris  are not to be extended and these being omitted it must be presumed to be  casus de industria omissus  and not  per incuriam Fountainhall  th  June  Administrators of  Heriot  's Hospital contra  Hepburn  Were this Law there could be no such Thing as Prescription in Burgage Holdings To be sure this could never be the Intention of the Act 'Tis true correctory Laws are  strictissimi juris  and not to be extended But the Subject of this Act is of another Nature It has its Foundation in the original Laws as well as in the Laws of other Countries and therefore reasonably may be extended to all similar Cases upon which Considerations the contrary was found  Forbes    th November  and  th December    Ker  contra  Abernethy  In other Cases a Sasine without a Warrant not bearing to proceed upon a Retour or Precept of  Clare constat  is no Title of Prescription  Stair  st  January    Fraser  contra  Hog  But a Procuratory of Resignation with a Sasine relative thereto was found a sufficient Title for Prescription tho' the Precept was wanting  Fountainhall    th June  Administrators of  Heriot  's Hospital contra  Hepburn  In the positive Prescription founded upon the Possession of Heirs it is sufficient to produce the naked Sasine without either the Precepts of  Clareconstat  or Retours upon which they are founded  Stair Gosford    th February  Earl of  Argyle  contra Laird  M'Naughton  But at the same Time it was found That the Sasine of an Heir who did not himself possess the whole Space of forty Years never being renewed in his Successors who all of them continued to possess as apparent Heirs was no sufficient Title  for Prescription  Stair  ibid  Fountainhall    th June  Earl of  Queensberry  contra Earl of  Anandale  But it appears to be without Controversy where the original Right itself is produced that the bare Possession of the Heir without Sasine is sufficient because here the Right has been possessed upon Years which is sufficient for Prescription  Whether  Usucapion  can proceed upon the Title  pro haerede  is a celebrated Question in the  Roman  Law which the  Roman  Lawiers themselves seem to have differed about and is not at all cleared up by their Commentators This Question because of its very great Import in our Practice must be considered at large To begin  Pomponius l    pro haerede  seems to lay down in general That  Usucapion  in this Case may proceed His Words are  Plerique putaverunt si haeres sim putem rem aliquam ex haereditate esse quae non sit Posse me usucapere  Upon his Side are ranged  l    eod  And  Julian l  §  de usurp usucap  On the other Hand the famous  Papinian  declares himself expresly That there can be no such Thing as an  Usucapion pro haerede l    divers temporal prescript Cum haeres in jus omne defuncti succedit ignoratione sua defuncti vitia non excludit Veluti cum sciens alienum illum illo vel precario possedit Quamvis enim precarium haeredem ignorantem non teneat nec interdicto recte conveniatur tamen usucapere non

Antoninus l    C Usucap pro haered Cum pro haerede usucapio  locum non habeat intelligis neque matrem tuam cui haeres extitisti neque te usu mancipia ex ea causa capere posse Dioclesian  and  Maximian

Commentators to reconcile these Texts in Appearance so opposite take a Method but too frequent amongst them They recur to Distinctions and if they can be so happy to make these Distinctions square with the Words of the Text they are very little solicitous about the  Spirit  and Meaning and thus they cut the  Gordian  Knot instead of loosing it They rarely proceed to the Examination whether their Distinctions are founded in Principles or in Reason and yet this is the only Point worthy the canvassing I am for from saying this is always the Case it must be acknowledged we owe a great Deal to the Commentators for the Lights they have afforded in clearing up the  Roman  Law yet it cannot have escaped any intelligent Reader that this Observation does not altogether want a Foundation and the Example to be here given is a notable Instance of it  To reconcile these Texts the Doctors make this Distinction  sciz  Whether the Defunct's Possession  was  vitious  or  bona fide  by any lawful Title such as  commodatum depositum precario  or such like They hold that if the Defunct's Possession was vitious there can be no  usucapio pro haerede  But if  bona fide  that is if the Defunct possessed as  Colonus Commodotarius  c the Subject so possessed by the Defunct may be acquired absolutely by the Heir upon this Title  usucapio pro haerede  See  Vinnius ad dict  §  Institut de Usucap Voet ad pandect T pro haered  § That this Distinction does by no Means agree with the Spirit and Meaning of the abovecited Texts will appear almost upon the first Reflection And that it is not founded in Principles we shall endeavour to show hereafter Besides the Misfortune is in this Case that it does not even agree with the Words  Papinian  says expresly in  dict l    Tamen usucapere non poterit quod defunctus non potuit  Compare also  dict l ult C Usucap pro Haerede  In the midst of so much Obscurity what Light shall we find Among all the Authorities abovecited  Papinian  is the single Writer who gives a Reason for his Opinion Says he There can be no  Usucapio pro Haerede quia haeres in jus omne defuncti succedit ignoratione sua defuncti vitia non excludit  Which is in other Words That the Heir is the same Person with the Defunct and therefore cannot be in a better Situation than him This I confess I could never throughly comprehend An Heir indeed is thus far the same Person with the Defunct that he is liable for all his Debts and succeeds in all his Rights But it was never imagined that an Heir is the same Person with the Defunct with respect to any purely personal Quality or Property good or bad If the Defunct has committed a Crime the Heir is not the  same Person in any Sense to be liable as the Criminal If the Defunct was a Tutor the Heir represents him  qua Debitor  not  qua Tutor  The same Way if the Defunct was  in mala fide  that is a personal Property wherein the Heir represents him not the Heir may well be supposed  in bona fide  tho' the  mala fides  of his Predecessor be ever so certain And this  Papinian  himself does allow in the Text giving an Instance of it in the Case of  Precarium  Let us examine what Light we can have from Principles It must be obvious from the Nature of Prescription that the Title real or putative to which the Possessor ascribes his Possession must be in its Nature  absolute  and  exclusive  Thus the Title  pro emptore  is an absolute exclusive Title for this good Reason that the same Subject cannot totally belong to two at once There cannot be Prescription against a Right which is compatible and consistent with the Right upon which the Prescriber founds Therefore a Right of a Wadset or of a Feu acquired by Prescription does no more  exclude  the Reverser or Superior than the Purchase of them does from the true Proprietor To apply this let us consider if at all or in what Cases the Title  pro haerede  is an absolute exclusive Title At first View it is plainly an absolute and exclusive Title as to all competing Heirs If one Person be  sole  Heir to the Defunct which is always implied in a Service where but one is mentioned no other Person can be Heir Thus far then there may be an  usucapio pro herede  His  bona fides  with the putative Title of being sole Heir will support him in the Right after having possessed during that Course of Time the Law requires Let us next consider how  this Title stands with Respect to the Debts and Deeds of the Defunct As to these it must be allowed that it is far from being an  absolute exclusive  Title An Heir  qua  such is liable to and burdened with all the Debts and Deeds of the Person whom he represents And therefore the Title  pro herede  is so far from being  exclusive  in this Case that in Reality it implies this Burden just as much as a Wadset implies a Reversion or a Feu the Right of Superiority This brings it to the same as if the Debts and Deeds of the Predecessor were every one of them specified in the Heir's Right In this Case therefore the Heir can have no  bona fides  no Security The Debts and Deeds of his Predecessor he must ever lay his Account to answer  If this hold and upon a Review I cannot find but it is solid the Distinction above laid down by the Commentators must fall to the Ground as without any Foundation If the Defunct's Possession was as  Colonus  or  Commoditarius  the Action  locati conducti  or  Commodati  competent against him must be good against his Heir for ever until they fall by the negative Prescription 'Tis true the Heir may believe that the Subject belonged to the Defunct in Property but then it is not every vague Opinion any how taken up that will found the  bona fides  necessary for Prescription It must be a solid Belief founded upon good Reason An Heir can never have a solid  bona fides  as to any Subject descending to him from the Defunct For ought he knows it may belong to another no Body has told him otherwise it may be given or promised away it may be burdened with Debt The very Title of Heir obliges him to submit to all these Chances which as above laid down effectually  excludes that  Security  that  bona fides  which is absolutely necessary in every Acquisition by Prescription It must be obvious then that this Distinction betwixt a  bona fide  and vitious Possession can signify nothing at all as to the Question in Hand  It being thus laid down that  usucapio pro haerede  is well founded where the Competition is among Heirs but that it cannot obtain against the Debts and Deeds of the Predecessor let us in the next Place examine what the Texts abovecited say as to this Distinction The  L    divers temporal Prescript L    ult C Usucap pro haered  §  Institut Usucap  relate all of them solely to the second Branch of the Distinction And the Authors have nothing in View but the Debts and Deeds of the Predecessor in these Texts where they declare against the  usucapio pro haerede  The  L  § cited upon the other Side of the Question plainly relates to the first Branch of the Distinction The Words are  Hoc amplius si justam causam habuerit existimandi se haeredem vel bonorum possessorem Domino extitisse fundum pro haerede possidebit  The  L ult pro haered  may well be understood of the same Case So there remains none that requires an Answer save  L    pro haered Plerique putaverunt si haeres sim putem rem aliquam ex haereditate esse quae non sit posse me usucapere  This Text 'tis obvious can have little Weight either Way It carries little more than an Insinuation that the Lawiers differed upon this Head But if it be Matter of Conscience with any one to have implicite Faith in every one of the  Roman  Lawiers for a further Answer let him consult  Heineccius ad Pandectas T pro haered  who understands  this Text of Cases like the following where for Example a foreign Sheep has fallen in with a Flock that is  in hereditate jacente  which therefore may be acquired by the Heir possessing  pro haerede bona fide  However though it should be allowed that in this Case  Usucapio  proceeds the Explanation does not much satisry me  Pomponius  is there speaking in general and 'tis hard therefore to suppose that he meant only of a particular Case  According to the Doctrine here laid down there must be a great Difference with respect to the two Sorts of positive Prescription established in our Law  sciz  that of Heirs and that of original Purchasers the last gives Security against all Mortals the other gives no Security against the Debts and Deeds of the Predecessor  It remains only to be mentioned that the  Usucapio pro haerede  so far as it relates to the Competition among Heirs is established in our Law by Act  Cap  and a Time fixed much shorter than the ordinary Course of Prescription For it statutes That no Retour shall be reduceable after twenty Years Sir  George Mackenzie  in his Observations upon this Act gives his Opinion That  this Prescription of twenty Years militates only in Cases of Competition betwixt the several Kinds of Heirs among themselves as Whether the Heir of Line should be preferred to the Heir of Taillie But it does not exclude the clear Interest of Blood for  jura sanguinis nullo jure civili dirimi possunt  L    de Reg Jur And therefore an elder Brothor was found to have good Interest to reduce a second Brother's Retour    th  January Lamb  contra  Anderson This Observation does not appear to have any Foundation in the Act which  talks in general of the righteous Heir and nearest of Kin And thus it was found th  July  Lady  Edinglassie  contra Laird of  Powrie  observed by  Fountainhall  That  "this Act does relate mainly to erroneous Services where a remoter Heir is retoured in Prejudice of a nearer but that it does not found Heirs served to quarrel their own Retours upon Minority and Lesion or such like seeing Minority and Lesion was a Ground of Reduction before that Act and needed no new Law"  As for the Decision  Lamb  contra  Anderson  when it is looked into it holds forth no such Distinction The Case there was That a younger Brother had served Heir while the elder was out of the Country And the Dispute turned solely upon this the elder Brother having returned with in the twenty Years and dying soon after the Lapse thereof without intenting an actual Reduction of his Brother's Retour whether the eldest Brother's Creditor who had charged him to enter Heir within the twenty Years and adjudged could have Access to the Lands Here it was not called into Controversy but that if the Heir had died abroad without making any Motion against his Brother's Retour the Retour would have stood good It was only contended That the Heir's Return with the Charge against him to enter was equivalent to a Reduction of the Brother's Retour which the Lords found Sir  George  has a second Observation upon this Act His Words are  By this Act though such Retours may be reduced in Prejudice of Persons so served yet if the Persons so served have disponed their Right to singular Successors having  bona fide  acquired Rights as said is they cannot be prejudged And in our Law  this is still introduced for the Good of Commerce in Favours of singular Successors for how should they know that the Retour was reducible  Were this Observation founded in the Act it would give a Security to Purchasers and in my Opinion a reasonable one that our Law as yet is not acquainted with It is no where held forth in general That onerous Purchasers are safe against all latent Claims all of these they stand exposed to that from their Nature are good against singular Successors and this among others Our Legislature has indeed rectified this in some Measure by several salutary Laws among these the Act of Prescription makes the greatest Figure It has further introduced Registers and appointed several Kinds of Rights to be registred under this Certification that otherwise they shall not be good against singular Successors But there are many Rights still behind not appointed to be registred and many more that from their Nature cannot admit of it of which this in Hand is an Example all of these are good against Purchasers Let us examine what the Act says as to this The Words are  It is always declared That these Presents shall nowise be prejudicial to whatsoever Persons who have acquired Rights of Lands and Heritages before the Date hereof  bona fide  from Persons already retoured thereto in any Time bygone But the said Persons who have  bona fide  acquired shall bruik their Rights  ACCORDING TO THE LAW THEN STANDING The Meaning of this is extremely obvious The Law referred to is  Parl    C  by which it was introduced That Retours should be unquarrellable after three Years both with Respect to the Inquest and the Person served This was altered by the present Act so far as relates  to the Person served who must now run a Course of twenty Years Prescription This Alteration being made it remained to be considered what should become of those who had purchased  bona fide  after three Years from Persons standing infeft upon Retours enjoying the Privileges of the former Law The Resolution upon this was obvious that they must be secure seeing the Persons from whom they purchased were secure by the said triennial Prescription Sir  George  in the above Citation understands this Clause as a Privilege introduced in general in Favours of singular Successors both who had acquired and who should acquire thereafter There needs little other Argument against this but the Clause itself upon which he founds his Observation which in express Terms restricts this Declaration to singular Successors who had purchased before the Date of this present Act That Purchasers from the Nature of the Thing are not secure against this Reduction will be clear  mo  Because this Reduction is not  personal  against the Defender but  real  in the Subject The righteous Heir coming up claims the Subject as his own and the Person retoured cannot stand in his Way having no Right established in the Subject till after the Course of the twenty Years Prescription In short it is not properly a Right  reducible  but  null  till it be  established  by Prescription which is the common Nature of Rights to which the positive Prescription is necessary And therefore a Purchaser from a Person erroneously retoured can be no more safe within the Years of Prescription than any one who purchases a  non Domino    do  This is plainly the Opinion of the Legislature in the abovecited Clause protecting the Purchasers only from those  whose Retours become irreduceable by Prescription  tio  Were Purchasers from Heirs absolutely secure  a principio  against this Reduction no good Reason could be given why this Reduction should be limited to twenty Years rather than the common Period of forty Whereas upon the Supposition that Purchasers are not secure till after the Lapse of twenty Years there is an exceeding good Reason for it One buys from an Heir seeing a sufficient good Progress for forty or fifty Years bygone This gives him tolerable good Security unless with Respect to this Reduction at the Instance of a nearer Heir It would be hard in this Case to leave him open and insecure for the Course of a second forty Years In a Word a shorter Prescription than twenty Years would be hard upon the righteous Heir a longer would be hard upon Purchasers  Whether the King's annexed Property be  extra commercium  so as not to be carried by Prescription is a Dispute our Lawiers seem not perfectly agreed in Sir  James Steuart  in Answer to  Dirleton  's Doubts  voce Prescription  thinks it cannot Sir  George Mackenzie  in his Institutions is of the same Mind Yet this Author in his Observations upon the Act anent Prescription Observation seems to be of a different Opinion As also  Dirleton voce Prescription against the King  who gives this remarkable Reason for it That the positive Prescription is introduced not so much  odio negligentia non petentis  as  favore possidentis  which says he is the same with Relation to the King as to another Lord  Stair  seems also to favour this Side of the Question holding That this Act  runs against the King as well as the Subject without making any Distinction §  hujus tituli  When we consider the Act itself there seems to be little Room for doubting that the King's annexed Property may be carried by the positive Prescription statuting  That whoso shall possess upon heritable Titles peaceably during the Space of forty Years shall not be troubled pursued or inquieted by his Majesty or others upon any Ground Reason or Argument competent of Law excepting Falsehood  And as a strong Fortification of this it must be noticed that in Act  Parl  the Prescriptability of annexed Property is directly taken for granted yet after all there is a Decision observed by  Fountainhall    February  King's Advocate  contra  Laird of  Livingstoun  that looks as if our Lords were of Opinion that the annexed Property is not prescribable It is to this Purpose that a Right of Servitude even upon the King's Property may be acquired by Prescription it not being annexed Property There is another Decision observed by Lord  Stair  that looks the same Way  February    Fergusson  contra Parishioners of  Kingarth  In our Practice the positive Prescription is extended to other Rights besides Lands which have Charter and Sasine for their Title And so a Tack null as being set without Consent of the Patron was found validated and unquarrellable by forty Years Possession  Stair Gosford    July  Parson of  Prestounhaugh  contra his Parishoners The like  Stair    February    Robertson  contra  Arbuthnot Stair    July  College of  Aberdeen  contra Earl of  Northesk Fountainhal    June  Earl  Leven  contra Parishoners of  Kennoway  and  Markinsh  But as to this Matter there is no small Difficulty Every Man is presumed to know the Law and therefore to know that a Tack of Teinds set without Consent of the Patron is not good So that here there can be no Title no  bona fides  for Prescription But possibly these Decisions may be defended upon the Footing of the negative Prescription the Action of Reduction of the Tack being lost  non utendo  If it be not said That the Tacks were simply null and needed no Reduction  A Possessor cannot prescribe contrary to the Terms of his own Right For this would not only be a Prescription without a Title or  bona fides  but even directly contrary to both Thus nothing can be acquired by Prescription without the Limits of a bounding Charter Hence the Decision must be wrong recorded by  Hope Tit Fishing    December    Forbes  contra Lady  Monimusk  Where a forty Years Possession of Salmond Fishing upon both Sides of the Water was sustained tho' the Possessor was only infeft in a Salmond Fishing upon one Side of the Water  Where the Title is general whereby it is dubious whether the Subject be disponed or not the forty Years Possession has two Effects  mo  It ascertains the dubious Clause and infers the Presumption that the Subject in Question was intended to be disponed and to be comprehended under the general Clause  do  It bestows the Property in Consequence of that Title where the Subject flowed  a non Domino  Thus a Charter with a general Clause  cum piscationibus  with forty Years Possession was  sustained as to a Salmond Fishing  Stair    January  Heritors of  Don  contra Town of  Aberdeen Stair    December    Brown  contra Town of  Kirkcudbright  Here a general Clause  cum piscationibus  is not commonly understood to carry Salmond Fishing as being  inter regalia  and therefore unless the Posssssion had explained the Clause so as to comprehend Salmond Fishing there could have been no Title for Prescription But a Charter of a Barony  cum piscationibus  needs no Possession to explain the Clause because a Charter of a Barony is interpreted in the most extensive Sense and therefore carries Salmond Fishing So that if the Disponer be  Dominus  the Disponee's Right is good  a principio  And in such a Case Prescription can only be necessary where the Right flowed  a non habente  See  Stair Gosford    February    Fullarton  contra Earl of  Eglingtoun  Compared with  Stair    January    Brown  contra Town of  Kirkcudbright  Upon the same Footing it was that in a Reduction at the King's Instance against the Heritors adjacent to a Muir of his Majesty's Patrimony the Lords found That not only the Heritors whose Charters bore the said Muir expresly but also even those who only carried the common Clause  cum communi pastura  had a Right of Servitude on it if they could prove Prescription by forty Years Possession  Fountainhall    February  King's Advocate  contra  Heritors about  Drumshorling  Muir  'Tis upon this same Footing that a forty Years Possession upon the dubious Title of  Part and Pertinent  infers Prescription Thus a Parcel of Ground was found to be acquired by Prescription in the Person of a singular Successor who had no other  Title thereto save that of  Part and Pertinent  and that tho' the Subject had formerly been a separate Tenement  Stair    November    Young  contra  Carmichael    February  Countess of  Murray  contra  Weems  And this was even found in Competition with one specially infeft in the Subject  Forbes    February  Earl of  Leven  contra  Finlay  And forty Years Possession of a Pasturage upon the Title of  Part and Pertinent  was found sufficient tho' a prior Tack of the Pasturage was produced set by the Pursuer's predecessors to the Defender's Predecessors in vertue of which it was alledged the Possession of the Pasturage began which was not found sufficient to take off the positive Prescription  Stair    November    Grant  contra  Grant  This Decision gives Rise to the following Considerations If the Possession be of a Servitude or such as can come under the Clause of  Part and Pertinent  the Presumption is that the Possession has followed in vertue of that Title but it must be noticed that it goes no further than a  Presumption  there being no Proof that the Servitude possessed is truly  Part and Pertinent  of the Lands If there were the Defence of Prescription would not be necessary To overturn such a  Presumption  then the Pursuer must have Access to prove that the Servitude was not possessed as  Part and Pertinent  but by Right derived from him a Tack for Example Of this there can be no Doubt if the Tack was set within the forty Years But now let us suppose That the Tack was set and run out before the Beginning of the Prescription will not the Presumption lie that the Tacksman continued to possess  per tacitam relocationem  Certainly since he began to possess the Servitude as a  distinct Subject and not as  Part and Pertinent  It is impossible thereafter that by a bare Act of his Mind he can forbear to possess as Tacksman and resolve for the future to possess upon the Footing of Part and Pertinent Nothing less would be necessary than a new Grant from some third Party Besides it was never heard That a  Resolution  did ever found a Right in order to Prescription Before he began to possess the Servitude as Part and Pertinent it is obvious he could not have the least Shadow of a Title to found him in a Prescription and of consequence that private Act of the Mind could not give him one 'Tis a different Case where the Tacksman sells his Property Lands and also the Subject set to him in Tack as Part and Pertinent of the Lands for in that Case the Purchaser has a good Title to found him in a Prescription  Stair    February  Countess of  Murray  contra  Weems  A Person grants a Wadset who has no Title himself The Wadsetter possesses forty Years The Wadsetter's Right is secure by Prescription Is the Reverser's Right also secure I answer No Because tho' the Wadsetter's Possession be the Reverser's Possession yet the Reverser has no  bona fides  no  titulus praescribendi  A habile Title may be founded on by the Receiver in order to Prescription never by the Granter Otherwise setting a Tack  qua  Proprietor might be founded upon by the Setter as  titulus praescribendi  Yet in this Case Prescription was found to run in Favours of the Reverser as well as Wadsetter  Forbes    June    Murray  contra  Maclellan  Servitudes are acquired by Prescription without any express Title in Writing Some of them by presuming from long Possession an antecedent Title which not being necessary to be in Writing at least in any formal Way the Writ if any has been may be readily supposed to have fallen by in that Time and if there has been only verbal Consent it is plain that after the Distance of forty Years the Possession must be the only Evidence thereof Other Servitudes such as paying dry Multures are upon a different Footing There every Act of Exercise of the Servitude infers a present Consent if there has not been one antecedent for it is rational enough to suppose that a Man will pay dry Multures in Subserviency to another Man's Right already constituted or in order to give a new Right But the Supposition is quite absurd that a Man looking to his own Interest and having no other View but to act in his Right of Liberty would go about to pay dry Multure  To compleat Prescription it is sufficient that the Party possess naturally himself or civilly by those deriving Right from him Thus the Liferenter's Possession was found to be the Fiar's Possession  Newbyth    November    Thomson  contra  Young  and  Porteous  For the Liferenter's Possession was her Defunct Husband's Possession from whom it was derived and the Defunct's Possession was the Heir's Possession The same will obtain where a Right is disponed to one in Liferent and another in Fie which is plain from this Consideration that the Possession of the Author and singular Successor are conjoined to make up Prescription when both possess upon the same Right  Moveables differ from Lands in the positive Prescription in this That forty Years Possession presumes a Title But still it must be competent to the former Proprietor to prove there was no Title which he does when he proves that the Defender or his Predecessors stole the Thing or that it was lent to them In which View the Decision  December  Minister and Session of  Aberscherder  contra Parishoners of  Gemrie  observed by  Durie  is not easie to be accounted for where in a Pursuit for a Church Bell lent by one Parish to another the Defence upon the positive Prescription was sustained by forty Years Possession without allowing the Pursuer to prove the Loan  The several Cases of non valens agere  Prescription as has been laid down being the Result of Neglect and Desertion it operates not where the Party can assign any just Cause of Forbearance And therefore    mo  Prescription runs only from the Term of Payment not from the Date of the Bond And therefore a Bond being payable to a Husband and Wife and longest Liver c Prescription was not found to run against the Wife's Liferentright of this Sum till after her Husband's Death because before that Time she had no Action nor Interest  Stair Dirleton Gosford    June    Gaw  contra Earl of  Weems  The like with respect to a Bond payable after the Granter's Decease  Stair    June    Bruce  contra  Bruce  And in general Prescription runs against no Right till Action be once competent upon it because from that Period  only can Neglect or Dereliction be dated And yet by an express Clause in the Act anent the septennial Prescription of cautionry Obligements Prescription runs from the Date not from the Term of Payment  maxime invita jurisprudentia Fountainhall    December    Gordon  contra  Cuming    do  The most proper Case of  non valens agere  is where the Person is barred by an injust Forfeiture from following out his Right For there can be no Neglect where there is no Liberty  Stair    January  Duke of  Lauderdale  contra Earl of  Tweedale  This was sustained to a Party who was Abroad in his Majesty's Service during the Usurpation and durst not appear under Hazard of his Life Tho' it was pled That in this Case there being no Forfeiture the Party might have appeared by a Procurator Sir  Patrick Home January    Whiteford  contra Earl of  Kilmarnock    tio  In some Cases it is laudable to forbear Action as for Example where a Woman in Decency forbears to pursue her Husband and therefore during the Time she is clad with a Husband Prescription runs not against her forbearing to pursue for Implement of her Contract of Marriage  Stair Gilmour    th July    Macky  contra  Stuart    to  Where the Circumstances are such that he can have no Benefit by acting As for Example Where a Man having in his Person two Adjudications upon an Estate continues to possess upon one of them for upwards of Years which is afterwards found redeemable The other Adjudication in the mean Time will not suffer the negative Prescription because he was not negligent in not persuing upon it having possessed the whole Estate by  Vertue of the other Adjudication And thus a Man is never put under a Necessity to act when he can have no other View but to stop Prescription For Prescription being a Consequence of Neglect if he was not negligent which he is not when he could have no Benefit by acting the Prescription cannot run It was objected against a Defender pleading upon the positive Prescription that for some time during the forty Years there was a Liferent of the Subject in Question in the Person of one of the Defender's Authors to which Liferent the Pursuer was Consenter and therefore during that Time he was  non valens agere  in Respect by no Action could he obtain Possession And the Lords never put Parties to the Necessity of intenting Processes where they can serve to no Purpose but to stop Prescription which was sustained  Stair    th February  Earl of  Lauderdale  contra Viscount of  Oxenfoord    th January  Duke  Lauderdale  contra Earl of  Tweedale    th January    Young  contra  Thomson    th February    Brown  contra  Hepburn  An apparent Heir in Possession of an Estate by singular Titles having thereafter purchased in an Apprising it was found That the apparent Heirs Possession did preserve the said Apprising from the negative Prescription It being pled in the general That where a Possessor has many Rights in his Person all distinct Titles of Possession Prescription cannot run against one of them so long as he keeps Possession For what can he demand upon any of these Titles but to have the Possession which if he already has there can be no Occasion for an Action But afterwards upon a reclaiming Bill the Lords found no Necessity of determining this Point having taken it up upon a separate Footing    th November  Mr  Alexander Frazer  contra  Hector M Kenzie  The septennial Prescription being alledged against a cautionry Obligement the Charger answered That for a Part of the Time he had a Ground of Compensation and so was  non valens agere  tho' that Ground was never propounded and now was removed This Answer was repelled  Fountainhall Forbes    th February    Bourbon  contra  Montgomery    to  No Man can prescrive against himself Of this take the following Example The Estate of  Paisley  c stood vested in the Person of Lord  Cochran  tailied to himself and Heirs Male after his Decease his Grandfather the Earl of  Dundonald  who had no Right in his own Person granted a Difposition of the same Estate to the Lord  Cochran  's Son and his Heirs Male One of whom above Years thereafter altered the Destination and conveyed the Subject to his Daughter The Disposition granted by the Earl of  Dundonald  being null as  a non habente potestatem  the Estate in Consequence was found to be all the while  in hereditate jacente  of the Lord  Cochran  upon which the Heir Male who had Access to make up his Titles to the Lord  Cochran  after the Decease of him who conveyed the Subject as said is to his Daughter quarrelled the Conveyance as being a gratuitous Deed by an apparent Heir And the forty Years positive Prescription in Consequence of the Earl of  Dundonald  's Disposition being pled in support thereof the Prescription was not found to run in Respect that no Man can prescrive against himself  Home    th January  Marquis of  Clydsdale  contra Earl of  Dundonald  In this Case there were no  termini habiles  for Prescription Prescription necessarily implies two  Persons two opposite Interests the one in a Course of acquiring either Property or Liberation the other in a Course of Neglect forbearing to follow out his Interest Here there was but one Person  sciz  the Heir Male And no Man can be accused of Negligence for not following out an Action against himself Besides no Ground of Action arose until the Disposition was granted to the Daughter and the Destination to Heirs Male thereby broke in upon We have then three Foundations each of which separately is sufficient to support this Decision  mo  A Man cannot prescribe against himself  do  No Benefit in pursuing  tio  No Action until the Time the Disposition was granted to the Daughter  As to Interruption of Prescription no Document taken upon the Debt will be sufficient to interrupt the negative Prescription unless it be such as is sufficient to interpel the Debitor Thus Registration of a Bond is no sufficient Interruption But when this is examined it will not be found to square exactly with the Principles laid down anent the negative Prescription 'Tis obvious that Registration alone is sufficient to purge the Creditors Neglect And when further Interpellation of the Debitor is found necessary it can be with no other View than to put an End to the  bona fide  Possession of his Liberty Now this indeed is reasonable as was hinted above but as our Practice requires no  bona fides  in a Debitor this Interpellation in order to an Interruption of the negative Prescription seems not to be well founded in Principles possibly it may be held that the Registration of a Bond without going on to interpel the Debitor for the Space of forty Years infers  a Presumption of some original Vitiosity in the Bond which barred the Creditor from bringing it sooner to Light And it may be said that Interpellation of the Debitor within the forty Years is a necessary Step to take off this Presumption Whatever be in this 'tis plain it cannot be universal For to put the Case where the Debitor acknowledges upon Oath that the Debt is just there simple Registration ought to be deemed sufficient to interrupt the negative Prescription  FINIS
