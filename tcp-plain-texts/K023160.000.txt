 OF THE CHARACTERS of WOMEN AN  EPISTLE  to a  LADY  By Mr  POPE  Price One Shilling  OF THE CHARACTERS of WOMEN AN EPISTLE TO A LADY  By Mr  POPE  LONDON  Printed by  J Wright  for LAWTON GILLIVER at  Homer  's  Head  against St  Dunstan  's Church in  Fleetstreet  MDCCXXXV Price One Shilling  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Author being very sensible how particular a Tenderness is due to the FEMALE SEX and at the same time how little they generally show to each other declares upon his Honour that no one  Character  is drawn from the Life in this Epistle It would otherwise be most improperly inscribed to a  Lady  who of all the Women he knows is the last that would be entertain'd at the Expence of Another  OF THE CHARACTERS of WOMEN AN EPISTLE  To a LADY  _NOTHING so true as what you once let fall  Most Women have no Characters at all  Matter too soft a lasting mark to bear  And best distinguish'd by black brown or fair  How many Pictures of one Nymph we view  All how unlike each other all how true  Arcadia  's Countess here in ermin'd pride  There  Pastorella  by a Fountain side  Here  Fannia  leering on her own good man  And there a naked  Leda  with a Swan  Let then the Fairone beautifully cry  In  Magdalen  's loose hair and lifted eye  Or drest in smiles of sweet  Cecilia  shine  With simp'ring Angels Palms and Harps divine  Whether the Charmer sinner it or saint it  When Folly grows romantic we must paint it  Come then the Colours and the ground prepare  Dip in the Rainbow trick her off in Air  Chuse a firm Cloud before it falls and in it  Catch e're she change the  Cynthia  of this minute  Rufa  whose eye quickglancing o'er the  Park  Attracts each light gay Meteor of a Spark  Agrees as ill with  Rufa  studying  Locke  As  Flavia  's diamonds with her dirty smock  Or  Flavia  's self in glue her rising task  And issuing flagrant to an evening Mask  So morning Insects that in Muck begun  Shine buzz and flyblow in the settingsun  How soft is  Silia  fearful to offend  The frail one's Advocate and weak one's Friend  To her  Calista  prov'd her Conduct nice  And good  Simplicius  asks of her Advice  Sudden she storms she raves You tip the wink  But spare your censure  Silia  does not drink  All eyes may see from what the change arose  All eyes may seea Pimple on her nose  Papillia  wedded to her am'rous Spark  Sighs for the Shades"How charming is a  Park  A  Park  is purchas'd but the Fair he sees  All bath'd in tears"Oh odious odious  Trees  Ladies like variegated Tulips show  'Tis to their Changes half their Charms we owe  Such happy Spots the nice Admirer take  Fine by defect and delicately weak  'Twas thus  Calypso  once our hearts alarm'd  Aw'd without Virtue without Beauty charm'd  Her Tongue bewitch'd as odly as her Eyes  Less Wit than Mimic more a Wit than wise  Strange Graces still and stranger Flights she had  Was just not ugly and was just not mad  Yet ne'er so sure our passion to create  As when she touch'd the brink of all we hate  Narcissa  's nature tolerably mild  To make a Wash would hardly stew a Child  Has ev'n been prov'd to grant a Lover's pray'r  And paid a Tradesman once to make him stare  Gave alms at  Easter  in a christian trim  And made a Widow happy for a whim  Why then declare Goodnature is her scorn  When 'tis by that alone she can be born  Why pique all mortals yet affect a name  A Fool to Pleasure yet a Slave to Fame  Now deep in  Taylor  and the Book of  Martyrs  Now drinking Citron with his Grace and  Ch  **  Now Conscience chills her and now Passion burns  And Atheism and Religion take their turns  A very Heathen in the carnal part  Yet still a sad good Christian at her heart  Flavia  's a Wit has too much sense to  pray  To  toast  our wants and wishes is her way  Nor asks of  God  but of her  Stars  to give  The mighty blessing "while we live to live"  Then all for Death that Opiate of the Soul  Lucretia  's Dagger  Rosamonda  's Bowl  Say what can cause such impotence of mind  A Spark too fickle or a Spouse too kind  Wise Wretch of Pleasures too refin'd to please  With too much Spirit to be e'er at Ease  With too much Quickness ever to be taught  With too much Thinking to have common Thought  You purchase Pain with all that Joy can give  And die of nothing but a Rage to live  Turn then from Wits and look on  Simo  's Mate  No Ass so meek no Ass so obstinate  Or her that owns her Faults but never mends  Because she's honest and the best of Friends  Or her whose Life the Church and Scandal share  For ever in a Passion or a Pray'r  Or who in sweet Vicissitude appears  Of Mirth and Opium Ratafie and Tears  The daily Anodyne and nightly Draught  To kill those Foes to Fair ones Time and Thought  Woman and Fool are  two  hard Things to hit  For true Nomeaning puzzles more than Wit  Pictures like these dear Madam to design  Asks no firm hand and no unerring line  Some wandring Touches some reflected Light  Some flying Stroke alone can hit them right  For how should equal Colours do the knack  Camelions  who can paint in White and Black  IN publick Stations Men sometimes are shown  A Woman's seen in Private life alone  Our bolder Talents in full view display'd  Your Virtues open fairest in the Shade  Bred to disguise in Publick 'tis you hide  Where none distinguish 'twixt your  Shame  and  Pride  Weakness  or  Delicacy  all so nice  Each is a sort of  Virtue  and of  Vice  In sev'ral Men we sev'ral Passions find  In Women two almost divide the Kind  Those only fix'd they first or last obey  The Love of Pleasures and the Love of Sway  That Nature gives and where the Lesson taught  Is but to please can Pleasure seem a fault  Experience This by Man's Oppression curst  They seek the second not to lose the first  Men some to Business some to Pleasure take  But every Woman is at heart a Rake  Men some to Quiet some to publick Strife  But every Lady would be Queen for life  Yet mark the fate of a whole Sex of Queens  Pow'r all their end but Beauty all the means  In Youth they conquer with so wild a rage  As leaves them scarce a Subject in their Age  For foreign Glory foreign Joy they roam  No thought of Peace or Happiness at home  But Wisdom's Triumph is welltim'd Retreat  As hard a Science to the Fair as Great  Beauties like Tyrants old and friendless grown  Yet hate Repose and dread to be Alone  Worn out in publick weary ev'ry eye  Nor leave one sigh behind them when they di    Pleasures the Sex as Children birds pursue  Still out of reach yet never out of view  Sure if they catch to spoil the Toy at most  To covet flying and regret when lost  At last to Follies Youth could scarce defend  It grows their Age's prudence to pretend  Asham'd to own they gave delight before  Reduc'd to feign it when they give no more  As Hags hold  Sabbaths  less for joy than spight  So these their merry miserable Night  Still round and round the Ghosts of Beauty glide  And haunt the Places where their Honour dy'd  See how the World its Veterans rewards  A Youth of Frolicks an old Age of Cards  Fair to no purpose artful to no end  Young without Lovers old without a Friend  A Fop their Passion but their Prize a Sot  Alive ridiculous and dead forgot  Ah Friend to dazzle let the Vain design  To raise the Thought and touch the Heart be thine  That Charm shall grow while what fatigues the Ring  Flaunts and goes down an unregarded thing  So when the Sun's broad beam has tir'd the sight  All mild ascends the Moon's more sober light  Serene in Virgin Modesty she shines  And unobserv'd the glaring Orb declines  Oh blest with  Temper  whose unclouded ray  Can make to morrow chearful as to day  That pleas'd can see a younger charm or hear  Sighs for a Sister with unwounded ear  That ne'er shall answer till a Husband cool  Or if you rule him never show you rule  Please by receiving by submitting sway  Yet have your humour most when you obey  Let Fops or Fortune fly which way they will  Despise all loss of Tickets or Codille  Spleen Vapors or Smallpox above them all  And Mistress of youtself tho' China fall  And yet believe me good as well as ill  Woman's at best a Contradiction still  Heav'n when it strives to polish all it can  Its last best work but forms a  softer Man  Picks from each Sex to make the Fav'rite blest  Your love of Pleasure our desire of Rest  Blends in exception to all gen'ral rules  Your Taste of Follies with our Scorn of Fools  Reserve with Frankness Art with Truth ally'd  Courage with Softness Modesty with Pride  Fix'd Principles with Fancy ever new  Shakes all together and produces  You  Ev'n such is Woman's Fame With this unblest  Toasts live a scorn and Queens may die a jest  This  Phoebus  promis'd I forget the Year  When those blue eyes first open'd on the Sphere  Ascendant  Phoebus  watch'd that hour with care  Averted half your Parents simple Pray'r  And gave you  Beauty  but deny'd the  Pelf  That buys your Sex a Tyrant o'er itself  That gen'rous God who Wit and Gold refines  And ripens Spirits as he ripens Mines  Kept Dross for Duchesses the world shall know it  To you gave Sense Goodhumour and a Poet  Speedily will be Published  Beautifully printed in  QUARTO
