 A COLLECTION OF LETTERS Never before printed WRITTEN By ALEXANDER POPE  Esq  AND Other ingenious GENTLEMEN To the Late AARON HILL  Esq  LONDON  Printed for W OWEN at  Homer  's  Head  near  TempleBar    FleetStreet  Price  s  MDCCLI  LETTERS FROM Several ingenious GENTLEMEN To the Late AARON HILL  Esq  LETTER I From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Dear Sir  THE little Thing which you take so kindly is but a very small Part of what I owe you and whatever my Studies or to use a properer Word Idleness are capable of producing ought to be returned you in mere Gratitude for the Pleasure I have received from your own Writings In which give me Leave to say your good Will to me in particular is as distinguishable as the Obligation you lay on the Publick in general I am very happy in the Envy and silly Attacks of such People as have awakened the Generosity of so powerful a Defender Nor am I ashamed of those Weaknesses of mine which they have exposed in Print the greatest of which was my thinking too candidly of them to whom I wrote my  Letters with so much unguarded Friendliness and Freedom since you have found a Way to turn those Weaknesses into Virtue by your partial Regard of them The Eye of Candour like the Sun makes all the Beauties which it sees it gives Colour and Brightness to the meanest Objects purely by looking on them I agree with you that there is a Pleasure in seeing the Nature and Temper of Men in the plainest Undress but few Men are of Consequence enough to deserve or reward that Curiosity I shall indeed and so will all Mankind be highly pleased to see the Great Czar of  Muscovy  in this Light drawn by himself like an antient Master in rough Strokes without heightening or shadowing What a Satisfaction to behold that perfect Likeness without Art Affectation or even the Gloss of Colouring with a noble Neglect of all that Finishing and Smoothing which any other Hand would have been obliged to bestow on so principal a Figure I write this to a Man whose Judgment I am certain of and therefore am as certain you will give the World this great Depositum just as you have received it There will be no Danger of your dressing this  Mars  too finely whose Armour is not Gold but Adamant and whose Stile in all Probability is much more strong than it is polish'd I congratulate you that this great Treasure is fallen into your Hands and I congratulate all  Europe  that it is to be delivered to them through the Hands of one who will think it Sacrilege to touch upon much less to alter any great Lines of such an Original  I can make you no better Return for your great Compliment upon me which it would be Arrogance in me to shew to any other and dangerous even to remember myself but by telling you that it is Honour enough to reward all my Studies to find my Character and Reputation is Part of the Care of that Person to whom the Fame and Glory of  Peter Alexiowitz  was committed  SIR  I am forced to make use of another Hand than my own in this Letter having received a Wound cross all the Veins of my right Hand by which the Tendons of two Fingers are separated however it was a Fine paid for my Life which has been very narrowly saved and which may now continue me some Years longer  Dear Sir  Your most faithful affectionate and obliged Servant A POPE  LETTER II From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Jan  SIR  I WAS unwilling to answer your too obliging Letter which puts much too great a Stress upon my Opinion till I had read your Play with the Attention it deserves I mean not once but several times over In a Word to comply with my Judgment will cost you no Trouble except to your Modesty which is  to act it as soon as possible  Nothing but Trifles have I to object and which were such as did not once stop me at the first Reading the Spirit Design and Characters carrying me on without Stop Check or even Intermission You certainly are Master of the Art of the Stage in the manner of forming and conducting the Design which I think impossible to be mended of that Great Part and of the other the raising the Passions I will say nothing to you who know them so much better than myself I would only point out a few Particularities in Thought or Expression as material as excepting to a Button on your Coat or a loose Hair Two or three Lines I have with great Timorousness written on one of your blank Leaves in Black Lead half afraid to  be legible and not without some Hope that before you see them they may be vanished So may perhaps my Objections every one of them Shall I see you soon to tell you these Nothings Whenever I shall see you I hope to find we can employ the Time better than I in telling or you in hearing them Or must I return you the Play now Your Orders will be obey'd as soon as you give themI really rejoice at your Lady's Recovery I would have her and you think the Air of  Richmond  is particularly good to reestablish her Pray let Miss  Hill  know I am ready to believe all the good Things her own Father can see in her I can safely trust both his  Judgments  and his  Affections  I am truly  SIR  Your obliged and sincerely affectionate Servant A POPE  LETTER III From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Feb  Dear Sir  I MADE a strong Essay to have told you in Person how very kindly I took your two last Letters The only Hours I had in my Power from a necessary Care that brought me back immediately I would have imposed on you It will please you to know the poor Woman is rather better tho' it may be but like the Improvement of a Light on the End of a dying Taper which brightens a little before it expiresYour Hint about my Title  Of false Taste  you'll see is made use of in the Second Edition Your Opinion also of my giving some publick Dissent or Protest against the silly malicious Misconstruction of the Town I agree to but I think no one Step should be taken in it but  in Concert  with the Duke whom they injure It will be a Pleasure  felt by you to tell you his Grace has written to me the strongest Assurance imaginable of the Rectitude of his Opinion and of his Resentment of that Report which to  Him  is an  Impertinence  to  me  a  Villainy  I am afraid of tiring you and what is your best Security I have not Time to do it I'll only just tell you that many Circumstances you have heard as Resemblances to the Picture of  Timon  are utterly Inventions of Lyars the Number of Servants never was an Hundred the Paintings not of  Venio  or  La Guerre  but  Bellucci  and  Zaman  no such Buffet Manner of Reception at the Study Terras  c  all which and many more they have not scrupled to forge to gain some Credit to the Application And which is worse belyed Testimonies of Noblemen and of my particular Friends to condemn me In a word the Malice is as great as the Dulness of my Calumniators The one I forgive the other I pity and I despise both Adieu the first Day I am near you I will find you out and shew you something you will like My best good Wishes are yours and Miss  Urania  's  Your affectionate Servant A POPE  LETTER IV From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  SIR  Parsons Green  Feb    SINCE I am fully satisfy'd we are each of us sincerely and affectionately Servants to the other I desire we may be no further misled by the Warmth of writing on this Subject If you think I have shewn too much  Weakness  or if I think you have shewn too much  Warmth  let us forgive one another's Temper I told you I thought my Letter a filly one but the more I thought so the more in sending it I  shew'd my Trust in your good Disposition toward me I am sorry you took it to have an Air of  Neglect  or  Superiority  Because I know in my Heart I had not the least Thought of being any way superior to Mr  Hill  and far from the least Design to shew Neglect to a Gentleman who was shewing me Civility I meant in Return to shew him a better Thing Sincerity which I'm sorry should be so ill express'd as to seem Rudeness I meant but to complain as frankly as you that all Complaints on both Sides might be out and at a Period for ever I meant by this to have laid a surer Foundation for your Opinion of me for the future that it might no more be shaken by Mistakes or Whispers  I am sure Sir you have a higher Opinion of my Poetry than I myself But I am so desirous you should have a just one of me every way that I wish you understood both my Temper in general and my Justice to you in particular better than I find my Letter represented them I wish it the more since you tell me how ill a Picture my Enemies take upon 'em to give of the Mind of a Man they are utter Strangers to However you will observe that much  Spleen  and  Emotion  are a little inconsistent with  Neglect  and an Opinion of  Superiority  Towards Them God knows I never felt any Emotions but what bad Writers raise in all Men those gentle ones of Laughter or Pity That I was so open concern'd and serious with respect to you only is sure a Proof of Regard not Neglect For in Truth nothing ever vex'd me till I saw your Epigram against Dr S and me come out in their Papers And this indeed did vex me to see  One Swan among the Geese  That the Letters  A H  were apply'd to you in the Papers I did not know for I seldom read them I heard it only from Mr  Savage  as from yourself and seat my Assurances to the contrary But I don't see how the Annotator on the  D  could have rectify'd  that Mistake  publickly  without particularizing  your Name  in a Book where I thought it too good to be inserted No doubt he has apply'd that Passage in the  D  to you by the Story he tells but his Mention of  Bombast    only  in some of your  Juvenile Pieces  I think was meant to shew that Passage hinted only at that  allegorical Muddiness  and not at any  worse sort of Dirt  with which some other Writers were charged I hate to say what will not be believ'd Yet when I told you  "Many ask'd me to  whom  that Oblique Praise was meant"  I did not tell you I answer'd it was  you  Has it escap'd your Observation that the Name is a Syllable too long Or if you will have it a Christian Name is there any other in the whole Book Is there no Author of two Syllables whom it will better fit not only as getting out of the allegorical Muddiness but as having been  dipt in the Dirt of Partywriting  and recovering from it betimes I know such a Man who would take it for a Compliment and so would his Patrons tooBut I ask you not to believe this except you are vastly inclin'd to it I will come closer to the Point Would you have the Note  left out  It shall Would you have it expresly said  you were not meant  It shall if I have any Influence on the Editors  I believe the Note was meant only as a gentle Rebuke and friendlily I understood very well the  Caveat  on your Part to be the same and complain'd you see of nothing but two or three Lines reflecting on my  Behaviour  and  Temper to other Writers  because I knew they were not true and you could not know they were  You cannot in your cool Judgment think it fair to fix a Man's Character on a Point of which you do not give one Instance Name but the Man or Men to whom I have unjustly omitted Approbation or Encouragement and I'll be ready to do them Justice I  think I have  publickly  prais'd all the best Writers of my Time except yourself and such as I have had no fair Opportunity to praise As to the  Great  and  Popular  I've prais'd but few and those at the Times when they were  least popular  Many of those Writers have done nothing else but flatter'd the Great and Popular or been worse employ'd by 'em in Partystuff I do indeed think it  no great Pride  in me to speak about  them  with some Air of Superiority and this Sir must be the Cause and no other that made me address  that Declaration  of my Temper towards  them  to  you  who had accus'd me of the contrary not I assure you from the least Imagination of any Resemblance between you and them either in Merit or Circumstances  I nam'd Mr  Dennis  because you distinguish him from the rest So do I But moreover he was uppermost in my Thoughts from having endeavour'd  before  your Admonition to promote his Affair with Lord  Wilmington  Lord  Lansdown  Lord  Blandford  and Mr  Pulteney  c who promis'd me to favour it But it would be unjust to measure my Goodwill by the Effects of it on the Great many of whom are the last Men in the World who will pay Tributes of this sort from their own ungiving Nature and many of whom laugh at me when I seriously petition for Mr  Dennis  After this I must not name the many whom I have fruitlesly sollicited I hope yet to be more successful But Sir you seem too iniquitous in your Conceptions of me when you fansy I call'd such Things  Services  I call'd 'em but  humane Offices  Services I said I  would  render him  if I could  I  would  ask a Place for Life for him and I  have  but that is not in my Power If it was it would be a  Service  and I wish it  I mention'd the  Possibility  of Mr  D  's abusing me for forgiving him because he actually did in  Print lately represent my poor undesigning Subscriptions to him to be the Effect of Fear and Desire to stop his Critiques upon me I wish Mr  Hill  would for once think so candidly of me as to believe me sincere in one Declaration that  "I desire no Man to belye his own Judgment in my Favour"  Therefore tho' I acknowledge your generous Offer to give  Examples  of  Imperfections  rather out of your own Works than mine in your intended Book I consent with all my Heart to your confining them to  mine  for two Reasons The one that I fear your Sensibility that way is greater than my own by observing you seem too concern'd at that Hint given by the Notes on the  D  of a little Fault in the Works of your  Youth  only The other is a better namely that I intend to amend by your Remarks and correct the Faults you find if they are such as I expect from Mr  Hill  's cool Judgment  I am very sensible that my  Poetical  Talent is all that may I say not will make me  remember'd  But it is my  Morality  only that must make me  Beloved  or  Happy  And if it be any Deviation from  Greatness of Mind  to prefer Friendships to Fame or the honest Enjoyments of Life to noisy Praises I fairly confess that Meanness Therefore it is Sir that I much more resent any Attempt against my moral Character which I know to be unjust than any to lessen my poetical one which for all I know may be very just  Pray then Sir excuse my weak Letter as I do your warm one I end as I begun You guess'd right that I was sick when I wrote it Yours are very well written but I have neither Health nor Time to make mine so I have writ a whole Book of Retractations of my Writings which would greatly improve your Criticisms on my Errors but of my Life and Manners I do not yet repent one Jott especially when I find in my Heart I continue to be without the least Acrimony  even as little as I desire you should bear to myself sincerely Sir  Yours affectionately A POPE  If I did not acknowledge as I ought both the Father's agreeable Present and the Daughter's pretty one which you sent me I very ill express'd myself If Miss  Urania Hill  has not my  to  Edition of the  Odyssey  I beg your Leave to send it her You had sooner heard from me but I saw yours here but three Days ago I return Home Tomorrow  LETTER V From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Feb  SIR  EVER since I return'd Home I have been in almost roaring Pain with a violent Rheumatism in my Shoulder so that all I am able to do is to return you Thanks for yours The Satisfaction it gave me is proportion'd to the Regard I have for you I will not praise your Poem further than to say the Generosity of its Sentiments must charm every Man Its other Merit you know well You'll pardon the few Doubts I start in the Interlinings they are such as you can efface as easily as they may deserve I wish to tell my Lord  Peterborough  who has so long honour'd me with so particular and familiar an Acquaintance the Honour done him  I am very desirous to leave out that  Note  if you like so The two Lords and one Gentleman who really took and printed that Edition I can I doubt not bring easily to it  The chief Objection I have to what you say of myself in this Poem is that the Praise is too strong I may well compound for the rest  Suffer me to send the young Lady the  Odyssey  full of Faults as I know it to be before she grows old enough to know how mean a Present it is I am with great Truth  SIR  Your most humble obedient Servant A POPE  LETTER VI From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  March  SIR  I AM extremely pleas'd with the Favour you have done me in sending me your Poem and the more as it gives me the Opportunity of assuring you I never did or meant you the least Injury in which I should have fully satisfy'd you long since had you ask'd me the Question I remember Mr  Lintot  shew'd me a Piece of yours of which he said you desir'd my Opinion I was just then in a great Hurry going a Journey out of Town upon Business for a few Days and therefore told him I would call for it in a Day or two to read carefully However I cast my Eye on some Parts of it which I lik'd and told him so This was all to the best of my Memory that pass'd between us and you may imagine it was some Surprize to me when I saw your Preface a very short time after I think it incumbent on any wellmeaning Man to acquit himself of an illgrounded Suspicion in another who perhaps means equally well and is only too credulous I am sincerely so far from resenting this Mistake that I am more displeas'd at your thinking it necessary to treat me so much in a Style of Compliment as you do in your Letter I will say nothing of the Poem you favour me with for fear of being in the wrong but I am sure the Person  who is capable of writing it can need no Man to judge it I am with all Respect  SIR  Your most obedient humble Servant A POPE  I receiv'd yours but four Days since it being directed to  Chiswick  where I have not liv'd this Twelvemonth  LETTER VII From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Twickenham  March  Dear Sir  I AM not more happy nor feel a greater Ease in comparison of my former Pain in the Recovery from my Rheumatism than in that from your Displeasure Be assur'd no little Offenders ever shall be distinguish'd more by me Your Dedication pleases me almost equally with the Poem our Hearts beat just together in regard to Men of Power and Quality But a Series of Infirmities for my whole Life has been but one long Disease has hinder'd me from following your Advices I this Day have writ to Lord  Peterborough  a Letter with your Poem The Familiarity in which we have liv'd some Years makes it not unusual in either him or me to tell each other any thing that pleases us Otherwise you might think it arrogant in me to pretend to put so good a Thing into his Hands in which I have no Merit Your Mention of our Friend Mr  Mallet  I thank you for and should be glad he would give me an Opportunity of thanking you in Person who am with Sincerity  SIR  Your obliged and faithful Servant A POPE  LETTER VIII From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Twickenham  April  Dear Sir  IT is a serious Pleasure to me to find you concern'd that I should do your good Sense and Discernment the Justice it deserves It is impossible for me not to think just what you would have me on this Head the whole  Spirit  and  Meaning  of your Poem shews all little Thoughts to be Strangers to your Soul I happen to know many Particulars relating to the Earl of  Peterborough  's Conduct and just Glory in that Scene you draw so well But no Man ought I think to attempt what you hint at or can pretend to do him more Honour than what you yourself here have done except himself I have long press'd him to put together many Papers lying by him to that End On this late Occasion he told me you had formerly endeavour'd the same and it comes into my Mind that on many of those Papers I've seen an Endorsement  A H  which I fansy might be those you overlook'd My Lord spoke of you with great Regard and told me how narrowly you both miss'd of going together on an adventurous Expedition  On an Expedition to the  West Indies  The real Reason I carry'd him your Poem was that I imagin'd you would never send it him of all Mankind and that I was truly pleas'd with it  I am troubled to reflect how unequal a Correspondent I am to you partly thro' want of Health for I have since had a Fever partly thro' want of Spirits and want of Solitude for the last Thing we Poets care to own is the other Want that of Abilities  But I am sensibly pleas'd with your Letter not only with that which seem'd to prompt it but with the Things said in it And I thank you for bothBelieve me desirous to see you When and where  you shall determine tho' I wish it were here You'll see a Place seeming more fit for me than it is looking Poetical yet too much in the World Romantic and not Retir'd However I can lock up all Avenues to it sometimes and I know no better Reason for doing so or for shutting out the World than to enjoy such an one as yourself  I am Sir with Esteem and Sincerity  Your most obedient faithful Servant A POPE  LETTER IX From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  August  Dear Sir  THE very Moment I receive yours I dispatch this to tell you with Sincerity both my Guest's and my own Concern to have no Hopes of seeing you as well as what is unfeignedly a yet greater Concern our Sorrow at what you express to be the Occasion of it He wishes now for Power for no other Reason than to be able to elevate Merit above that Fortune it commonly finds from Power And I can truly add for my own Part who never tasted Power that I never felt any Uneasiness in a low Fortune but that which it causes when I find it cannot prove the Regard and Love I bear to true Worth in any afflictive Circumstance  Excuse my pretending to say a Word on that Subject all I meant to say but the Overflowings of my Heart vented thus much was to beg you to think too favourably of us both to imagine we should not be unhappy as much as dissatisfy'd if we did not read once or twice more your Tragedy after what you tell us of your having alter'd it on our Suggestions We have a conscientious Fear that you may have comply'd too implicitly with those  Marks  rather of  our scrupulous Sincerity than of any certain Judgment and have quench'd sometimes a Flame we admire tho' we may fear or sometimes heighten'd what may be natural tho' we might think it low Pray ease us by favouring us with a second View of it  And whenever you send me that Essay you may be assur'd of my sincere Answer tho' upon that Head I could rather wish it were given you personally I hope a little Time will bring us together Know me most affectionately dear Sir  Yours A POPE  LETTER X From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Sept  I COULD not persuade myself to write to you since your great Loss till I hop'd you had receiv'd some Alleviation to it from the only Hand which can give any that of Time Not to have mention'd it however fashionable it may be I think unnatural and in some Sense inhuman and I fear the contrary Custom is too much an Excuse in reality for that Indifference we too usually have for the Concern of another In truth that was not my Case I know the Reason of one Man is of little Effect toward the Resignation of another and when I compar'd the Forces of yours and mine I doubted not which had the Advantage even tho' in your own Concern 'Tis hard that in these tender Afflictions the Greatness of the Mind and the Goodness are opposite to each other and that while Reason and the Consideration upon what Conditions we receive all the Goods of this Life operate towards our Quiet even the best of our Passions which are the same Things with the softest of our Virtues refuse us that  Comfort But I'll say no more on this melancholy Subject The whole Intent of this Letter is to tell you how much I wish you capable of Consolation and how much I wish to know when you find yourself so I would hope you begin to seek it to amuse your Mind with those Studies of which  Tully  says  Adversis perfugium solatium praebent  and to transcribe if I may so express it your own Softnesses and generous Passions into the Hearts of others who more want them I do not flatter you in saying I think your Tragedy will do this effectually to which I had Occasion the other Day to do Justice to Mr  Wilks  or whatever else you chuse to divert your own Passion with and to raise that of your ReadersI wish the Change of Place or the Views of Nature in the Country made a Part of your SchemeYou once thought of  Richmond  I wish you were there or nearer I have thrice miss'd of you in Town the only Times I have been there My last Month was pass'd at my Lord  Cobham  's and in a Journey thro'  Oxfordshire  I wish you as susceptible at this Time of these Pleasures as I am I have been truly concern'd for you and for your Daughter who I believe is a  true Part  of you I will trouble you no farther but with the Assurance that I am not unmindfully  SIR  Your most sincere humble Servant A POPE  LETTER XI From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Sept  Dear Sir  I HAVE been and yet am totally confin'd by my Mother's Relapse if that can be call'd so which is rather a constant and regular Decay She is now on her last Bed in all Probability from whence  she has not risen in some Weeks yet in no direct Pain but a perpetual Languor I suffer for her for myself and for you in the Reflection of what you have felt at the Side of a sick Bed which I now feel and of what I probably soon shall suffer which you now suffer in the Loss of one's best Friend I have wish'd ever since I saw your Letter to ask you since you find your own House a Scene of Sorrows to pass some Days in mine which I begin to think I shall soon have the same melancholy Reason to shun In the mean time I make a sort of Amusement of this melancholy Situation itself and try to derive a Comfort in imagining I give some to her I am seldom prompted to Poetry in these Circumstances yet I'll send you a few Lines I sent t' other Day from her Bedside to a particular Friend Indeed I want Spirits and Matter to send you any thing else or on any other Subject These too are spiritless and incorrect  While ev'ry Joy successful Youth is thine  Be no unpleasing Melancholy mine  Me long ah long may these soft Cares engage  To rock the Cradle of reposing Age  With lenient Arts prolong a Parent's Breath  Make Languor smile and smooth the Bed of Death  Me when the Cares my better Years have shown  Another's Age shall hasten on my own  Shall some kind Hand like  B***  's or thine  Lead gently down and favour the Decline  In Wants in Sickness shall a  Friend  be nigh  Explore my  Thought  and watch my asking  Eye    Whether that Blessing be deny'd or giv'n  Thus far is right the rest belongs to Heav'n  Excuse this in a Man who is weak and wounded but not by his Enemies but for his Friends I wish you the Continuance of all that is yet dear to you in Life and am truly  Yours A POPE  LETTER XII From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Twickenham  Sept  SIR  THE Hurry I was in to send to you made it a Message instead of a Letter which I ask your Excuse for by this If now you have Thoughts of the Country pray think no further than my own House I am wholly at your Service The Weather is yet inviting I could wish if Miss  Hill  under a Father's Authority might venture she saw me before I am quite decay'd I mean all of me that is yet half flourishing my Garden You'll very much oblige me and give Countenance to my Judgment in letting your Tragedy pass thro' my Hands to any Persons to whom you care I should shew it Believe me with great Truth and a real Concern for what must so much afflict a good Mind  SIR  Your affectionate obedient Servant A POPE  LETTER XIII From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Sept  Dear Sir  I Return you the Inclos'd the Day after I receiv'd it lest it should retard your finishing the Copy now the Year draws toward Winter And tho' I am in a great Hurry which allows me to say little only to tell you in my Lord's Name and my own that we think you shew even more Friendship and Confidence in us than we have hitherto been justly intitled to from any Use our Opinion could be of to a Judgment so good as your own We are fully satisfy'd and 'tis but at a Word or two that I  can  carp  with the utmost and most extended Severity of a Friend It will be with infinitely greater Promptitude and Pleasure that I shall speak everywhere my real Approbation and Esteem of the Performance in which I shall do no more than discharge my Conscience I wish sincerely I could as well serve you in promoting its Success as I can testify it deserves all Success You will I am sure be so candid and so reasonable as to conclude I would not decline writing your Epilogue on any but a just Reason and indeed to me an invariable Maxim which I have held these Twenty Years Every poetical Friend I have has had my Word I never would and my Leave to take the same Refusals I made him ill if ever I wrote one for another And this very Winter Mr  Thomson  and Mr  Mallet  excuse me whose Tragedies either are to appear this Season or the next I fansy the latter as I have seen or heard of no more but a  first  Act yet of each  I have lately had an Address of  another Kind  from a Man of Letters which gives me more Embarrass and in the Conduct whereof I could wish I had your Advice tho' I hardly know how to ask it I hope soon to see the Critical Work you promis'd me in which I hope to have some further Occasion of proving to you the real Deference I have to your Sentiments and Esteem for your Person I am dear Sir  Your faithful and affectionate obliged Servant A POPE  LETTER XIV From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Oct  Dear Sir  IT was my Hope you had Thoughts of passing a few Days hereabouts that made me impertinent enough to wish you would make use of this Place  which is as much at your Service as its Master It is otherwise too great a Trouble to you no less than too great a Distinction shewn to me to have you come purposely much less to give the young Lady the Fatigue of an Afternoon's Visit to what so little merits it My Wish was that you could have taken a Bed here as long as you could allow yourself to be in the Country and have done me the Pleasure to see the Person you now love best in the World with you either as giving you to me or receiving you from me on the Day that you came or that you went Be assur'd I always am with Truth  Dear Sir  Your most oblig'd affectionate faithful Servant A POPE  If Miss  Hill  does not dine with us I shall think all the Rites of Hospitality violated  LETTER XV From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Monday Night Oct  Dear Sir  I SEE the Season will not allow me the Pleasure of seeing you nor of shewing my faded Garden this Year to Miss  Urania  I assure you I would willingly make a Trip to  London  on purpose to see you and her but my Constitution of late has been faster in Decline than the Year I have been as ill as when I writ you that peevish Image of my Soul a Letter some Time since which had the good Effect of making us know one another  This is the first Day I have been able to see Lady  S  who shew'd me a very polite Letter of yours that put her out of Countenance The Truth is she makes no Pretension to judge of Poetry But the Tragedy will be shewn as I told you to One or rather  I think to Both will be better I wish you was not so soon to bring it on by what Mr  Savage  tells me of Mr  Booth  and Mrs  Porter  I think it will be a Loss both to the Play and to them if they do not make one another shine I hope in a Week to wait on you in  London  and tell you with what plain Truth I am dear Sir  Yours A POPE  My Book I have no manner of Thought of publishing It is of so various a Nature that I know not under what Denomination yet to rank the many Parts of it and shall write just as I live without knowing the  End  of my Works or Days The Whole will proceed as my Life proceeds and probably die as I die  LETTER XVI From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Thursday Oct  Dear Sir  THERE is an ill Fate hangs upon me in relation to the Pleasure I've often from the very first Time I saw you at Dr  Young  's propos'd in our Acquaintance I really stay'd that Night in Town upon  Bowry  's Notice which he left in Writing that you should  be at Home all  Wednesday and had dedicated three Hours to you or more properly to myself with you I ask'd particularly for Miss  Urania  but thought myself tho' old enough not familiar enough to ask to see her I desire your first Notice if you come this Way or rather I wish you would take up your Lodging with me In the mean time pray send the Tragedy of  Athelwold  for so I would call it under Cover to the Countess of  Suffolk  before  Monday  at her Lodgings in  St James  's I promis'd it her again and if you think it of any Consequence  that the K should see it in Manuscript I think nothing more easy In Truth all this is doing it no Credit 'tis only doing some to those who may commend it I could not imagine in what Parts it needed Addition sure every Incident is well prepar'd But no Man can see so far into his own Work as the Author if a good one so little if a bad or indifferent oneI am with Truth  SIR  Your very obliged and faithful Servant A POPE  LETTER XVII From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Chiswick  Nov  SIR  I Troubled you with a hasty Scrawl at Lord  Tyrconnel  's in which I mention'd  Gilliver  's Desire to be the Publisher of your Tragedy Since he requests my Letter to recommend him I find Mr  Savage  has rais'd his Hope by saying you had kept  yourself unengag'd    in Expectation that I would  plead for him and that  you wonder'd I did not sooner  If this be not one of those Things in which Mr  S  speaks upon Imagination I am more oblig'd to you than ever I intended For I assure you I had no Thought of  imposing  nay not even of  proposing  a Bookseller for fear your great Complacency toward me should lead you more than your own Inclination to another Bookseller But if you have no such Byafs this Man I really think honest and capable in his Business I hope in a few Days to meet you in Town and am sincerely yours and the young Lady's  A POPE  I just now receive your very kind Letter but can answer it no otherwise than by going about what you propose I'll write first and then see every body I can in Town on  Tuesday  c  LETTER XVIII From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Nov  Dear Sir  I SHALL have the Pleasure sick or well to be at the first Representation of your Play Tomorrow with Lord  Burlington  and Lord  Bathurst  and one or two more Another noble Lord who understands you best must be contented to read the two last Acts in his Study But Sir  Will Wyndham  with Mr  Gay  and some others will be there also in another Place in his steadI write this that I may not take up a Minute of your Time in calling on me Tomorrow but if you will send to the Office Tonight for Places for four People we will order a Man or two to go to keep 'em for us Lord  Burlington  comes on purpose to Town I am with great Truth  Yours A POPE  I've yet heard no Account from Court  LETTER XIX From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Sat Morn Nov  Dear Sir  I Cannot leave  London  without thanking you for the Pleasure you gave me last Night by which I see you can as well make Actors as Plays Yet I own I receive more Pleasure from reading than seeing your  Athelwold  I thought the best Part of the Audience very attentive and was told several Ladies were mov'd to Tears It is Pity Mrs  Cibber  's Voice and Person were not a little higher she speaks extremely justly and seems to be Mistress of her Part I could not come soon enough for the Prologue but the Epilogue is a very humorous one I am asham'd to trouble you but being gone out of Town and fearing the Mistakes of Servants I beg a Box may be had for  Monday  the third Night if there be any empty for Mrs  Blount  a particular Friend of mine I yesterday saw Lady  Suffolk  and found tho' their Majesties had not had Time to read yet they were possess'd with a good Opinion of the Play and she would not part with the Copy expecting it would be call'd for every Day I must once more acknowledge the very obliging Manner in which you favour'd the Bookseller as well as the particular Generosity to him I can add no more but an Assurance of the Sincerity with which I am  Dear Sir  Your most oblig'd and affectionate Servant A POPE  I am hasten'd away on hearing my Mother is not well As soon as I return I hope we may pass more Time together  LETTER XX From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Twickenham  Dec  Dear Sir  I Thank you for your Tragedy which I have now read over a sixth Time and of which I not only preserve but increase my Esteem You have been kind to this Age in not telling the next in your Preface the ill Taste of the Town of which the Reception  you describe it to have given of your Play worse indeed than I had heard or could have imagin'd is a more flagrant Instance than any of those Trifles mention'd in my Epistle which yet I hear the sore Vanity of our Pretenders to Taste flinches at extremelyThe Title you mention had been a properer to that EpistleI have heard no Criticisms about it nor do I listen after 'em  Nos haec novimus esse nihil  I mean I think the Verses to be so But as you are a Man of tender Sentiments of Honour I know it will grieve you to hear another undeservedly charg'd with a Crime his Heart is free from For if there be Truth in the World I declare to you I never imagin'd the least Application of what I said of  Timon  could be made to the D of  Ch  s  than whom there is scarce a more blameless worthy and generous beneficent Character among all our Nobility And if I have not lost my Senses the Town has lost 'em by what I heard so late as but two Days ago of the Uproar on this Head I am certain if you calmly read every Particular of that Description you'll find almost all of 'em pointblank the Reverse of that Person's  Villa  It's an aukward Thing for a Man to print in Defence of his own Work against a Chimaera You know not who or what you fight against The Objections start up in a new Shape like the Armies and Phantoms of Magicians and no Weapon can cut a Mist or a Shadow Yet it would have been a Pleasure to me to have found some Friend saying a Word in my Justification against a most malicious Falshood I speak of such as have known by their own Experience these twenty Years that I always took up their Defence when any Stream of Calumny ran upon 'em If it gives the Duke one Moment's Uneasiness I should think myself ill paid if the whole Earth admir'd the Poetry and believe me would rather never have written a Verse in my Life than that any one of 'em should  trouble a truly good Man It was once my Case before but happily reconcil'd and among generous Minds nothing so endears Friends as the having offended one another  I lament the Malice of the Age that studies to see its own Likeness in every thing I lament the Dulness of it that cannot see an Excellence The first is my Unhappiness the second yours I look upon the Fate of your Piece like that of a great Treasure which is bury'd as soon as brought to Light but it is sure to be dug up the next Age and enrich Posterity  I have been very sensible on these two Occasions to feel them as I have done at a Time when I daily fear'd the Loss of what is and ought to be dearer to me than any Reputation  but that of a Friend  or than any thing of my own  except my Morals  the Loss of a most tender ParentShe is alive and that is all I have perceiv'd my Heart in this and you may believe me sincerely  Dear Sir  Your faithful and really affectionate Servant A POPE  LETTER XXI From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Twickenham  Nov  Dear Sir  I Writ to you a very hasty Letter being warm'd in the Cause of an old Acquaintance in which I was sure you would concur I mean  John Dennis  whose Circumstances were describ'd to me in the most moving Manner I went next Day with the Lord to whom you directed your Letter and Play which at my Return home I receiv'd but Yesterday I thank you for your agreeable Present to my Grotto for your more agreeable Letter and your most excellent Translation of  Voltaire  to whom you have preserv'd  all the Beauty he had and added the Nerves he wanted This short Acknowledgment is all I can make just now I am just taken up by Mr  Thomson  in the Perusal of a new Poem he has brought me I wish you were with us The first Day I see  London  I will wait on you on many Accounts but on none more than my being affectionately and with true Esteem dear Sir  Yours A POPE  I desire Miss  Urania  will know me for her Servant  LETTER XXII From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Twickenham  May  SIR  YOUR very kind Letter came hither in my Absence which occasion'd my Delay till now in acknowledging it Your Partiality to me both as a Poet and as a Man is great the former I deserve not but the latter I will never forfeit It would be wronging your Modesty to say much of the Verses you inclose but it would be wronging Sense and Poetry not to say they are fine ones and such as I could not forget having once seen them  I have almost forgot what I told you of the Patent but at the Time I told it I could not well be mistaken having just then had the Account from Mr  Davenant  the Envoy Indeed I fansy it was only of his Ancestors Patent that he spoke unless Sir  William Davenant  bought up  Killigrew  's I know no Way of coming to the Knowledge of this Affair Mr  Davenant  being now abroad and I know not where But if you would have me write about it I will learn his Direction  I am at all Times glad to hear of you on any Occasion I would willingly wait on you in the  Park if I knew your Times I have call'd twice or thrice there in vain without being heard I guess'd you were in the Country My sincere good Wishes attend you and your agreeable Family as far as I have seen of it I cannot but wish well to I am  Dear Sir  Your most affectionate and faithful Servant A POPE  LETTER XXIII From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  June  SIR  I SENT you as honest an Answer as I could to the Letter you favour'd me with and am sorry you imagine any  civil Reproach  or  latent Meaning  where I meant to express myself with the utmost Openness I would assure you if you please by my Oath as well as my Word that I am in no Degree displeas'd at any Freedom you can take with me in a private Letter or with my Writings in publick I again insist that you alter or soften no one Criticism of yours in my Favour nor deprive yourself of the Liberty nor the World of the Profit of your freest Remarks on my Errors  In what I said I gave you a true Picture of my own Heart as far as I know it myself It is true I have shewn a  Scorn  of some  Writers  but it proceeded from an Experience that they were bad Men or bad Friends or vile Hirelings in which Case their being Authors did not make them to me either more respectable or more formidable As for any other Pique my Mind is not so susceptible of it as you have seem'd on each Occasion too much inclin'd I think to believe What may have sometimes seem'd a  Neglect  of others was rather a  Laziness  to cultivate or contract new Friends when I was satisfied  with those I had or when I apprehended their Demands were too high for me to answer  I thank you for the Confidence you shew you have in me in telling me what you judge amiss in my  Nature  If it be as you too partially say my only Fault I might soon be a perfect Character For I would endeavour to correct this Fault in myself and intreat you to correct all those in my Writings I see by the Specimen you generously gave me in your late Letter you are able to do it and I would rather owe and  own  I owe that Correction to your Friendship than to my own Industry  For the last Paragraph of yours I shall be extremely ready to convey what you promise to send me to my Lord  B  I am in Hopes very speedily to see him myself and will in that Case be the Bearer if not I shall send it by the first safe Hand to him I am truly glad of any Occasion of proving myself with all the Respect that is consistent with Sincerity  SIR  Your most obliged and affectionate Servant A POPE  LETTER XXIV From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  June  SIR  THE Favour of yours of  May  the th had not been unacknowledged so long but it reached me not till my Return from a Journey which had carried me from Scene to Scene  where Gods might wander with Delight  I am sorry yours was attended with any Thoughts less pleasing either from the Conduct towards you of the World in general or of any one else in particular As to the Subjectmatter of the Letter I found what I have often done in receiving Letters from those I most esteemed and  most wished to be esteemed by a great Pleasure in reading it and a great Inability to answer it I can only say you oblige me in seeming so well to know me again as one extremely willing that the free Exercise of Criticism should extend over my own Writings as well as those of others whenever the Public may receive the least Benefit from it as I question not they will a great deal when exerted by you I am sensible of the Honour you do me in proposing to send me your Work before it appears If you do I must insist that no Use in my Favour be made of that Distinction by the Alteration or softening of any Censure of yours on any Line of mine  What you have observed in your Letter I think just only I would acquit myself in one Point I could not have the least  Pique  to Mr  Th  in what is cited in the Treatise of the  Bathos  from the Play which I never supposed to be his He gave it as  Shakespear  's and I take it to be of that Age And indeed the Collection of those and many more of the Thoughts censured there was not made by me but Dr  Arbuthnot  I have had two or three Occasions to lament that you seem to know me much better as a  Poet  than as a  Man  You can hardly conceive how little either Pique or Contempt I bear to any Creature unless for immoral or dirty Actions Any Mortal is at full Liberty unanswer'd to write and print of me as a Poet to praise me one Year and blame me another only I desire him to spare my Character as an honest Man over which he can have no private much less any public Right without some personal Knowledge of my Heart or the Motives of my Conduct Nor is it a sufficient Excuse to alledge he was  so  or  so informed  which was the Case with those Men  I am sincere in all I say to you and have no Vanity in saying it You really overvalue me greatly  in my Poetical Capacity and I am sure your Work would do me infinitely too much Honour even if it blamed me oftener than it commended For the first you will do with Lenity the last with Excess But I could be glad to part with some Share of any good Man's Admiration for some of his Affection and his Belief that I am not wholly undeserving to be thought what I am to you  SIR  A most faithful affectionate Servant A POPE  LETTER XXV From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  July  SIR  I NEED not assure you in many Words that I join my Suffrage intirely with Lord  B  's in general after a fourth reading your Tragedy of  Caesar  I think no Characters were ever more nobly sustained than those of  Caesar  and  Brutus  in particular You excel throughout in the Greatness of Sentiment and I add that I never met with more striking Sentences or lively short Reprizes There is almost everywhere such a Dignity in the Scenes that instead of pointing out any one Scene I can scarce point out any that wants it in any Degree except you would a little raise that of the  Plebeians  in the last Act That Dignity is admirably reconciled with Softness in the Scenes between  Caesar  and  Calpurnia  And all those between  Caesar  and  Brutus  are a noble Strife between Greatness and Humanity The Management of the Whole is as artful as it is noble Whatever particular Remarks we have made further will be rather the Subject of Conversation than a Letter of which we shall both be glad of an Opportunity either here at  Twickenham  or in Town as shall best suit your Conveniency Pray Sir let  this confirm you in the Opinion you kindly and indeed justly entertain of the Wish I feel and ever felt notwithstanding Mistakes to be and to be thought  Sincerely your obliged affectionate and faithful Servant A POPE  LETTER XXVI From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Twickenham  Aug  SIR  I AM forced to say but little to you tho' my Spirit has been warm'd by the kind and let me add the just Manner in which you took our last Letter My Lord who has not only resolved to make himself my Guest but an Inhabitant of this Place during all his Stay in this Kingdom is at this Time fixed to this Place too closely by a Fever which has confined him to his Bed and Chamber some Days I am but just now satisfied that he is out of Danger and I am as sure as that he  lives  that he will be glad to see you  here  And I think it certain if you can get those Affairs over which you mention as soon as I wish you at Ease that you may find him here this Fortnight That I shall take a warm Part in bringing you together my own Heart knows And let me tell you when you know that Heart as well as I hope Fortune will not long hinder you from doing tho' many unlucky Strokes of her Influence have been too strong upon us both who  must  else have naturally united as we mutually love and hate the same Things I believe trust and pray we shall perfectly understand one another Believe me till then upon my bare Assurance very faithfully without superfluous Words in one Word  Dear Sir  Yours A POPE  LETTER XXVII From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Sept  SIR  I HAVE now little to say of your Tragedy which I return with my Thanks for your Indulgence to my Opinion which I see so absolutely defer'd to that I wish I had cross'd less frequently I cannot find another Thing I think a Fault in you  But my Lord thinks three Things may yet be reconsider'd  Brutus  on Sight of the Warrant sign'd for his Death takes at once the Resolution of murdering  Caesar  as none of his Father Quere Whether in the Scene that follows between him and  Caesar  all Tenderness on the Side of  Brutus  and all beyond the Point of Honour that Friendship exacted should not rather be avoided than heightened  Another Quere is Whether it would not beget more Indignation in the Audience against  Cassius  and more Compassion for  Caesar  to shew that  Cassius  suspected  Brutus  to be  Caesar  's Son and therefore exacted from  Brutus  the Oath of sparing neither  Father  Relation  c  The third Thing is Whether the Efforts made by  Caesar  to prevent the Civil War not only by the equal Offer he made while the Matter was under Debate in the Senate and which the Consuls  Lentulus  and  Marcellus  refused to report to the Senate but by the Message he sent to  Pompey  when he was at  Brundusium  to desire a Meeting to settle the Matter and avoid the Civil War  Vid Caes Comm de bell    Civili    lib  The Mention of these somewhere in the Play might help to remove the Prepossession against  Caesar  After our little Cavils for so we will rather call minute and verbal Points of Criticism we owe you the Justice to extol highly what we highly approve  and you need not desire us to speak as we think 'Tis what we have in different Ways done all our Lives where it was to our Prejudice and cannot but do here where it is to our Honour I only wish you a Stage Actors and an Audience worthy of you and ItI have often wished to live to see the Day when Prologues and Epilogues should be no more I wish a great Genius would break thro' the silly useless Formality But at least I would have one try to leave the Audience  full  of the  Effects  of a good Tragedy without an Epilogue Let me add another Hint concerning the Apparatus and Circumstantials of your Play since I have nothing left more to wish in the Play itself that you would intitle it barely  The Tragedy of Caesar  and give no Intimation of his being a  Patriot  for I fear instead of preparing the Audience it might revolt them and put all the little Criticks upon carping previously at the very Design and Character which would appear by Degrees and with the proper Preparations in the Piece on the Stage Another thing was a Thought of my Lord's that it should be printed before acting a Day or two for the Sentiments are so thicksown and the Sense so deep sometimes that they require more Attention and Thought than the Hearer may be apt to give on the first Representation I am not positive either as to his or my Thought but submit them to your Consideration  I have nothing to add but to lament our Unhappiness that we cannot see you personally to confirm what these Letters tell you of our real Opinion of your Work Esteem of its Author and Wishes for your Success in this and every thing I am  SIR  Your most faithful and obliged Servant A POPE  LETTER XXVIII From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Nov  Dear Sir  THIS is quite a Letter of Business and therefore excuse it I will not mix in it a Word of Affection which I have not a Moment's time to express and will not prejudice the sacred Idea of Friendship  It is near a Month ago that I try'd to see Mr  Thomson  to know the Time of his Tragedy He was not within my Reach and therefore at last I wrote to him and also to Mr  M  to let them both know the Deference you paid them and the heroic I will not call it less Disinterestedness you express'd in regard to them I have not yet been able to hear where they are or any way to have an Answer further than I have learn'd it will be impossible for either of them to bring on their Plays early a Friend of theirs telling me they are in no Forwardness till the Middle or End of the Winter therefore you may have room I wish from my Soul you may get yours first as well acted as it deserves A better that may eclipse it or even worthily follow it I hardly expect to seeBut upon this Notice I believe you may safely advance it the sooner the better  My Lord  B  is yet with me more properly I yet belong to him Body as well as Mind for my Mind is everywhere his I would to God you had any Opportunity of seeing us before we part my House should be yours as much of it as is not his I believe I shall soon go with him on a little Journey before he quits  England  You'll forgive the abrupt Conclusion of this yet it may tell you all the longest  and bestwritten Letter could tell you that I am very sincerely  SIR  Your much obliged and really affectionate Servant A POPE  LETTER XXIX From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Dec  Dear Sir  I HAVE been confirmed by Mr  Thomson  as to the Retardment of his Play of which he has written but two Acts I have since seen Mr  M  who has finished his but is very willing yours should be first brought on in  January  as you propose or after his in  February  whichsoever may be most agreeable to you He farther offers any Assistance he can give you in case of your own Absence as to treating with Mr  F  with whom he thinks you cannot be too careful or explicit or attending the Rehearsals for you which he promises to undertake with all Diligence if you are not provided with another Friend in that Case He has heard of some Impertinence which may be apprehended from one Person's Refusal or Unwillingness to act and believes he can employ some proper Influence to bring him to a right Behaviour These with any other Services in which you may please to employ him he bids me assure you it will be a high Satisfaction to him to engage in  I must express on my own Part a real Regret to be so little useful to you I can do no more than join with Lord  B  in paying due Praises to so meritorious a Work our Suffrage is an airy Tribute from whence no solid Good redounds to you and I find myself still more inclined to the  Man  than the  Author  if I could be any way instrumental to the Happiness  or Ease of so generous an one I could almost wish myself a Minister to patronize such a Genius and I could almost wish my Lord one again for no other Reason even tho' his Country wants such an one as well as his Friends  I have never once been able to see Mr  Thomson  in Person when I do and it shall be soon he shall know how much he is obliged to you for that Plan of an Alteration of his Tragedy which is too good for me with any Honesty to put upon him as my own Believe me Sir with great Truth and the warmest Disposition to do you Justice before Men and Angels  Yours faithfully A POPE  LETTER XXX From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  London  Feb  Dear Sir  I HAVE felt an Uneasiness of Mind occasioned by a conscious Sense how unequally I have express'd my Anger and Contempt at the Treatment of your  Caesar  by the Man of the Stage ever since I last wrote to you and a hundred Interruptions from Day to Day for I have lived in the World and a busy and idle World both it is have ever since hindered me from enjoying one Hour of collected Thought Yet I am the less concerned since by my Delay I can now tell you I have last Night seen Mr  Mallet  's Play the fifth Act of which I had not before read thro' those Interruptions I have mention'd It succeeded hitherto at least for Yesterday was the first Day as well as I could expect But so vilely acted in the Womens Parts and the Mens except two that I wonder it could succeed Mr  Thomson  after many shameful Tricks from the Manager is determined to act his Play at the other Theatre where the Advantage  lies as to the Women and the Success of  his  will depend upon them I heartily wish you would follow his Example that we might not be deprived of  Caesar  I have yet seen but three Acts of Mr  Thomson  's but I am told and believe by what I have seen that it excels in the Pathetic The Dignity of Sentiment and Grandeur of Character will still be  Caesar  's as in his History so in your Poetry superior to any  The Person to whom you intended so great a Compliment as to address that Piece to his Name is very sensible of your delicate Manner of Thinking He bids me assure you his own Knowledge of your Intention is sufficient Pleasure to him and desires you would not think of doing him either Favour or Justice till the World knows better how to do itself the former in doing you the latter He is still detained here by the Perverseness of his Affairs and wishes as I most heartily do also that Fortune did not treat you so much alike The Stage is as ungrateful to you as his Country to him You are both sure of Posterity and may say in the mean time with  Scipio    Ingrata Patria    ne ossa quidem habeas  Believe me most truly  SIR  Your affectionate angry Servant A POPE  LETTER XXXI From Mr POPE To AARON HILL  Esq  Jan  SIR  I AM oblig'd to you for your Compliment and can truly say I never gave you just Cause of Complaint You once mistook on a Bookseller's idle Report and publickly express'd your Mistake yet you mistook a second time that two initial Letters only were meant of you tho' every Letter in  the Alphabet was put in the same manner And in Truth except some few those Letters were set at Random to occasion what they did occasion the Suspicion of bad and jealous Writers of which Number I could never reckon Mr  Hill  and most of whose Names I did not know  Upon this Mistake you were too ready to attack me in a Paper of very pretty Verses in some publick JournalI should imagine the  Dunciad  meant you a real Compliment and so it has been thought by many who have ask'd to whom that Passage made that oblique  Panegyrick  As to the Notes I am weary of telling a great Truth which is that I am not Author of 'em tho' I love Truth so well as fairly to tell you Sir I think even that Note a Commendation and should think myself not ill us'd  to have the same Words said of me  Therefore believe me I never was other than friendly to you in my own Mind  Have I not much more Reason to complain of  The Caveat  Where give me Leave Sir to tell you with the same Love of Truth and with the Frankness it inspir'd which I hope you will see thro' this whole Letter I am falsly abus'd in being represented  "  sneakingly to approve and want the Worth to cherish or befriend Men of Merit  "  It is indeed Sir a very great Error I am sorry the Author of that Reflection knew me no better and happen'd to be unknown to those who could have better inform'd him For I have the Charity to think he was misled only by his Ignorance of me and the Benevolence to forgive the worst Thing that ever in my Opinion was said of me on that Supposition  I do faithfully assure you I never was angry at any Criticism made on my Poetry by whomsoever If I could do Mr  Dennis  any humane Office I would tho' I were sure he would abuse me personally Tomorrow therefore it is no great Merit in me to  find at my Heart I am your Servant I am very sorry you ever was of another OpinionI see by many Marks you distinguish'd me from my cotemporary Writers Had we known one another you had distinguish'd me from others as a  Man  and no ill or illnatur'd one I only wish you knew as well as I do how much I prefer Qualities of the Heart to those of the Head I vow to God I never thought any great Matters of my poetical Capacity I only thought it a little better comparatively than that of some very mean Writers who are too proudBut I do know  certainly  my moral Life is  superior  to that of most of the  Wits  of these Days This is a silly Letter but it will shew you my Mind honestly and I hope convince you I can be and am  SIR  Your very affectionate and humble Servant A POPE  As there had formerly been some little Misunderstanding between Mr  Pope  and Mr  Hill  it is thought necessary to insert in this Place two or three of Mr  Hill  's Letters that the Reader might be fully apprised of the Reason each thought he had to take it ill of the other And in Mr  Hill  's Works which are going to be printed by Subscription 'tis humbly conceived there will be many Letters not only writ to Mr  Pope  but also to Persons of the  highest Rank  that will be both instructive and entertaining to the curious Reader  LETTER XXXII From Mr HILL To Mr POPE  Jan  SIR  YOUR Answer regarding no Part of mine but the Conclusion you must pardon my Compliment to the Close of yours in return if I agree with you that your Letter is  weaker  than one would have expected  You assure me that I did not know you so well as I might had I happened to be known to others who could have instructed my Ignorance and I begin to find indeed that I was less acquainted with you than I imagined But your last Letter has enlighten'd me and I can never be in Danger of mistaking you for the future  Your Enemies have often told me that your  Spleen  was at least as distinguishable as your  Genius  And it will be kinder I think to believe them than impute to Rudeness or ill Manners the Return you were pleased to make for the Civility with which I addressed you  I will therefore suppose you to have been  peevish  or in  Pain  while you were writing me this Letter And upon that Supposition shall endeavour to undeceive youIf I did not love you as a good  Man  while I esteem you as a good  Writer  I should read you without Reflection And it were doing too much Honour to  your  Friends and too little to my  own Discernment  to go to  them  for a Character of your Mind which I was able enough to extract from your Writings  But to imitate your Love of Truth with the Frankness you have taught me I wish the  Great  Qualities of your Heart were as strong in you as the  Good  ones You would then have been above that Emotion and Bitterness wherewith you remember  Things which want Weight to deserve your Anguish  Since you were not the Writer of the Notes to the  Dunciad  it would be impertinent to trouble you with the Complaint I intendedI will only observe that the Author was in the  Right  to believe me capable of a second  Repentance  but I hope I was incapable of that second  Sin  which should have been previous to his SuppositionIf the initial Letters  A H  were not  meant  to stand for my Name yet they were everywhere read so as you might have seen in  Mist  's  Journal  and other publick Papers and I had shewn Mr  Pope  an Example how reasonable I thought it to clear a Mistake publickly which had been publickly propagatedOne Note among so many would have done me this Justice And the Generosity of such a Proceeding could have left no Room for that offensive  Sneakingly  which though perhaps too harsh a Word was the properest a Man could chuse who was satirizing an Approbation that he had never observed warm enough to declare itself to the World but in Defence of the  Great  or the  Popular  Again if the Author of the Notes knew that  A H  related not to me what Reason had he to allude to that Character as mine by observing that I had published Pieces bordering upon  Bombast  A Circumstance so independent on any other Purpose of the Note that I should forget to  whom  I am writing if I thought it wanted Explanation  As to your oblique Panegyrick I am not under so blind an Attachment to the  Goddess  I was devoted to in the  Dunciad  but that I knew it was a  Commendation  tho' a dirtier one than I wished for who am neither fond of some of the Company in which I was listedthe noble Reward for which I was to become a Diverthe allegoric Muddiness in which I was to try my Skillnor the Institutor  of the Games you were so kind to allow me a Share in  Since however you could see so clearly that I ought to be satisfied with the Praise and forgive the Dirt it was mixed with I am sorry it seemed not as reasonable that you should pardon me for returning your Compliment with more and opener Praise mixed with less of that Dirtiness which we have both the good Taste to complain of  The  Caveat  Sir was mineIt would have been ridiculous to suppose you ignorant of it I cannot think you need be told that it meant you no Harmand it had scorn'd to appear under the borrow'd Name it carries but that the whimsical Turn of the Preface would have made my own a ContradictionI promise you however that for the future I will publish nothing without my Name that concerns you or your Writings I have now almost finished  An Essay on Propriety and Impropriety in Design Thought and Expression illustrated by Examples in both Kinds from the Writings of Mr Pope  and to convince you how much more Pleasure it gives me to distinguish your  Lights  than your  Shades  and that I am as willing as I ought to be to see and acknowledge my Faults I am ready with all my Heart to let it run thus if it would otherwise create the least Pain in you  An Essay on Propriety and Impropriety  c  illustrated by Examples of the first from the Writings of Mr  Pope  and of the last from those of the Author  I am sorry to hear you say you never thought any great Matters of your  Poetry  It is in my Opinion the Characteristic you are to hope your  Distinction  from To be  Honest  is the Duty of every  plain Man  Nor since the  Soul  of Poetry is Sentiment can a  Great Poet  want  Morality  But your  Honesty  you possess in common with a  Million  who will never be  remembered  whereas your  Poetry  is a Peculiar that will make it impossible you should be forgotten  If you had not been in the  Spleen  when you wrote me this Letter I persuade myself you would not immediately after censuring the  Pride  of Writers have asserted that you  certainly    know  your moral Life above that of most of the Wits of these Days At any other Time you would have remembered that  Humility  is a moral Virtue It was a bold Declaration and the  Certainty  with which you know it stands in need of a better  Acquaintance  than you seem to have had with the  Tribe  since you tell me in the same Letter that many of their  Names  were  unknown  to you  Neither would it appear to your own Reason at a cooler Juncture overconsistent with the Morality you are so sure of to scatter the Letters of the whole Alphabet annexed at Random to Characters of a light and ridiculous Cast confusedly with Intent to provoke jealous Writers into Resentment that you might take Occasion from that Resentment to expose and depreciate their Characters  The Services you tell me you would do Mr  Dennis  even tho' he should abuse you in Return will I hope give him some Title to expect an Exertion of your recommendatory Influence in his Behalf A Man so  popular  as you might secure him a great Subscription This would merit to be called a  Service  and the more the World should find you abused in the Works you had recommended so much the more glorious Proof would they see that your Morals were in Truth as superior as you represent them to those of your Cotemporaries Tho' you will pardon me the  Pride  of wondering a little how this Declaration came to be made to  me  whose Condition not standing in need of such Services it was not I think so necessary  you should have taken the Trouble to talk of them  Upon the Whole Sir I find I am so sincerely your  Friend  that it is not in your own Power to make me your  Enemy  Else that unnecessary Air of Neglect and Superiority which is so remarkable in the Turn of your Letter would have nettled me to the Quick and I must triumph in my Turn at the Strength of my own Heart who can after it still find and profess myself most affectionately and sincerely  Your humble Servant A HILL  LETTER XXXIII From Mr HILL To Mr POPE  Feb  SIR  I AM oblig'd to you for your Letter from  Parsons Green  and come heartily into the Proposal it begins with A mutual Resolution to forget in each other the Appearance of every Thing that has been distasteful to either agrees I am sure with the Affection I feel for you at my Heart where it is founded on a natural Strength both of  Reason  and  Inclination  The  Caveat  began originally with the Vision I added not till after it was finish'd those Lines among which are the unlucky Ones that displeas'd you I was scarful lest without something of that kind by way of Introduction the Reader might think himself push'd too abruptly into the Allegory But I confess it was unreasonable in me to cover your  Praise  which I delighted in under the Veil of an Allegory and explain my  Censure  too openly in which I could take no Pleasure  The Truth is I lov'd you so well and thought of you so often that it was not easy for me in any  Humour to write Verse and not dwell upon youHave you never been  jealous  of a favourite  Mistress  Have you never under a  Pique  at her suppos'd  Neglect  said what she could no more deserve than you could think she did upon cooler ReflectionAnd have you not found after all that you was never the less her  Lover  Your Offer is very kind to prevail on the Editor of the  Dunciad  to leave out the Note or declare that I was not meant in it But I am satisfiedIt is overand deserves no more of your Application  I agree with you It is  Morality  makes us belov'd I know it from the Effect of your Writings where I  but admire  the Harmony and the Elegance while I  love  the Generosity and the Candor of the Sentiments I prefer too as you do  Friendships  and the honest Enjoyments of Life to  Fame  and noisy  Praises  but I am glad you are happier than you wish to be who enjoy both Benefits together  Yet if there was nothing desirable in  Fame  there could be nothing detestable in  Slander  and your honest Uneasiness at being  thought  worse than you  are  would in that Case be in Danger of passing for a  Weakness  I know however that you consider  Praise  in a nobler Light than  Vanity  There is in Fame the Promulgation of a good Man's Example which his natural Life being too short to extend so far as he wishes  That  Defect is supplied by the second Life he receives from his  Memory  I have seen and been asham'd of that low Turn which Mr  Dennis  gave to your GoodnatureWhere a Man's  Passions  are too strong for his  Virtues  his  Suspicion  will be too hard for his  Prudence  He has often been weak enough to treat you in a Manner that moves too much Indignation against Himself not to leave it unnecessary for you also to  punish himNeither of us would chuse him for a  Friend  but none of the  Frailties  of his  Temper  any more than the heavy  Formalities  of his  Style  can prevent your acknowledging there is often  Weight  in his  Arguments  and  Matter  that deserves Encouragement to be met with in his  Writings  I will soon Sir convince you that my Sensibility is not so tender as you suppose it to be I am so far from an Inclination to defend some  Pieces  which I was too much a Boy when I publish'd that I embrace all Occasions of exposing 'em myself to the Contempt they have merited  I am already too much oblig'd not to blush at your Mention of the  Odyssey  with a View of sending it to my Daughter and  She  is too inquifitive a Lover of what gives her  Instruction  with  Delight  to have been satisfied without finding in her Closet whatever she had heard  you  had publish'd  As a Proof how determin'd I am to throw nothing upon the World that may give you Cause of Complaint I will send you in Manuscript the  Essay on Propriety  as soon as it is finish'd I do the same now by a smaller Piece I am about to publish because you will find yourself concern'd in some Part of itI am Sir with great Truth  Your most humble and most obedient Servant A HILL  LETTER XXXIV From Mr HILL To Mr POPE  June  SIR  THE Pleasure I was sure to receive with your Letter brought an unexpected Chagrin in its Company from a Vein of civil Reproach that runs thro' it which I can better discern than account for since I must not suspect without wronging my  Ideas of your Equity that you could be displeas'd at the Freedom I took in my Sentiments If I believ'd they had given you the smallest Offence I would rather commit my Essay in its present rough State to the Flames than transcribe it either for yourself or the Publick  Indeed it was with a kind of foreboding Reluctance that I censur'd any Passage of  yours  and to confess the Truth frankly I had only one Reason for doing it After I had convinc'd myself thoroughly that  Propriety  in some of the Lights I was considering it under had been universally neglected in Poetry I foresaw it would be impossible to establish the Belief of a Fact so unlikely without citing the strongest  Examples  To do this from the Works of our  dead  Authors only carry'd the Face of a  Meanness  I could not tell how to submit toTo draw formal Citations from any Pieces that had appear'd of my own tho' full enough God knows of Absurdities to have furnish'd more Proofs than I wanted would have look'd too assuming and sillyTo borrow such Instances out of other less faulty Cotemporaries not however reputed among the sparkling great Luminaries of Wit would have induc'd a mistaken Conclusion that in the Works of more masterly Writers there were no such  Examples  to be met withAnd nowIs there a good Judge in  England  except one who will not see and acknowledge the Necessity that threw me unavoidably upon  your  Writings  However I am glad at my Heart it was Dr  A  t  who made that Collection you mention for I am almost unwilling to be found in the  Right  when I disapprove what  your  Name has been stamp'd on yet your own honest Argument that it is not enough to excuse a Reporter of Falshoods that he was told and believ'd what he publish'd must defend me against its Advancer For neither is it a sufficient Excuse that a  Writer  whose Name in the Front of  a Book has given Weight to the Censures it propagates was not  Author  of some of those Censures since whatever a Man sets his  Hand  to he ought first to examine the  Truth  of  I am charm'd while I hear you disclaim that Propensity to  Pique  and  Contempt  which to speak with the Soul of a Friend seems to me the only  Spot  on your CharacterWe are All of us in some Lights or other the  Dupes  of our natural Frailties And when Mr  Pope  with the Warmth that becomes a great Mind tells me how far he is from despising Defects in Men's  Genius  never feeling any Contempt but for the Dirt of their  Actions  I am sure he says nothing but what he firmly believes to be true And yet there are Pieces well known to be  his  many Passages whereof no Man less appris'd than himself of his Heart's secret Views and Intentions can read without being strongly convinc'd of a Scorn that regards  Genius  only Tho' if he loves you but half so sincerely as I do you have no sooner disavow'd the Design than he concludes the Imputation was groundless  In the mean Time 'tis Pity that a Thinker so humane and benevolent should indulge an Ambiguity in the Turn of his Expression that scatters Gall which his Heart never licens'd since I believe it a general Truth that Men of the openest and honestest Natures sooner catch Fire at  Contempt  than  Oppression  And as to any  Dirtiness  in Actions which take Birth from Effect of such Influence we may conclude from those irresistible little Sallies of  Fury  whereby even among undesigning and innocent Infants we see  Brother  precipitated into Outrage against  Brother  immediately upon any cold Provocation of  Scorn  that there is nothing  immoral  in what may be done or declar'd too offensively under Impressions so violent so involuntary and natural  After all this grave Face of Apology I am an absolute Stranger to the  Grounds  upon which those Men you refer to proceededNay I am so for the most part even to the  Measures  by which they provok'd you All the Reason indeed that I have for giving you any of  my  Thoughts on the Subject is deriv'd from your own starting into it a little digressively immediately after hinting some Occasions you had to lament that I knew you less justly as a  Man  than a  Poet  I will appeal to impartial Posterity whether I do not know you much better in both Lights than ten thousand of those pretending  Esteemers  of whose Affection you think yourself surer It will never be in my  Will  nor my  Power  to transmit such a  Picture  as yours without its best and most beautiful  Likeness  I shall leave to duller  Dutch  Painters in Criticism their unenvied Delight to draw  Monsters  And know very well for my own Part that I should but  disgrace  the desir'd Reputation of my  Pencil  if I miss'd the  Resemblance  too widely in a Piece which must expect to be compar'd with Originals of the same by many different  Masters  Tho' I acquit you of any further Allusion to  me  than by that retrospect Glance  en passant  I have  affectionately  caught the Occasion of pointing out to one of the least intentionally guilty among Men a seeming  Tartness  of Spirit in himself which he will easily  find  when he looks for and which whenever he does find and guard against by submitting his  Wit  to his  Philosophy  he will become the most  unnatural  good Man in the World for he will leave himself not a  Fault  to be blam'd for  As to myself who was born to mix Sin with Repentance I plead guilty to all such Indictments as you in that Place  present  to my MemoryI was always too perceptibly quick in my Apprehension of  Contempts  or  Indignities  A Temper which would have been as  unpardonable  as I confess it to be  weak    and  selfmortifying  but that the Fault tho' of too swelling a Nature leaves no Voids for Admission of  Malice  It is an offensive indeed but reconcileable Imbecillity of Mind  Shakespear  felt and understood it very finely  " It carries  Anger  as the Flint does  Fire  " Which being struck throws out a hasty  Spark    " And then grows cold again"  Yet I will endeavour to redress this wrong Bent in my Temper and make Way for the Rectification you are so good as to shew me my WANT OFAnd thus in the Commerce of  Friendship  as in Traffick less generous there is offer'd a mutual Exchange of AdvantagesSomething always to  give  and to  gain  And this makes  both Sides  more rich and more satisfy'dWhat a Loss then have unsocial and vain Dispositions which by a sullen Seclusion from these Rights of Reproof and Plaindealing cut off all the kind Use of Correction  Human Nature  let it be as susceptible of  Grace  as it can never yet wanted  Pride  enough to make Mortifications of this Kind a  Requisite  Far from hating our  Friends  for a little faithful tho' unwelcome  Asperity  let us think  him  of all Men  unhappiest  who has never been bless'd with an  Enemy  And now let me ask you with a Transition very fashionably abrupt and uncriticalHow is your good and great Friend Lord  B  to be reach'dYou will scarce think I meanto be  emulated  Ours is an Age that exposes such an oldfashion'd Politician as HE is to any  Fear  sooner than that of a  Rival  I have a Packet to send him a little too large for the  Post  It is a manuscript Piece which I purpose to  dedicate  to him when publish'd But it would be Prudence and Decency as Affairs stand at present to wait his Permission after reading it Not that there is any thing nice or exceptionable in the  Subject and I am sure I have no need to add tho' I speak of a  Dedication  that mine has no  Views  like a  modern  one If you will be so kind as to think how it may reach my Lord's Hands I shall in a few Days send it open to yours begging you first to peruse and then give it a Seal and a Forwarding If you will have the Goodness to authorize such a Trouble please to do it under a Direction like your last to  SIR  Your most humble and affectionate Servant A HILL  LETTER XXXV From Mr HILL To Mr POPE  June  SIR  IT is Time to relieve you from Subjects and Lengths like my last yet you will hardly suspect such a Blindness in my bad Understanding as to think I distinguish not the true  Cast  of some Colours which you need not have held quite so near meNotwithstanding all which if I had not more Cause to distrust it on  your  Side than my  own  I should flatter myself we were born to be  Lovers  we are so often and so unaccountably mistaking one another into  Reserves  and  Resentments  Yet I am sorry whenever this happens because the most  lost  Time in Mens Lives is  that  which they waste in  Expostulation  They who are  Friends  find it  selfish  and  diffident  and between  Enemies 'tis inflaming  and  fruitless  Indeed there would be no End of suchwhat must I call 'em  Eclaircissements  is an affected  French  Word and I am heartily sorry I  want  itIn plain  Truth  and  English  I always did and I still do most affectionately  esteem  you both as  Man  and as  Poet  And if nowandthen for a Start I have been put  out of Humour with  either  I would fain have you think it was no less your  own  Fault than  mine  At least I am sure I believ'd so And if whenever you suppos'd me to have acted inconsistently with myself on that Principle you had only been so kind as to have declar'd  why  you thought so I would openly and immediately either have demonstrated the  Mistake  to be  yours  or confess'd and abhorr'd my  own Error  I will always stand  bound  to give if not a  rational  yet a  moral  Account of my  Actions  Not alone as they regard Mr  Pope  but  Men  in the remotest Situation below him And whoever let him be accus'd either by Misapprehension or Calumny would  decline  such a  Test  of his  Conduct  in Life is so far from being worthy your  Friendship  that he is a  Stranger  to both  Spirit  and  Honesty  Here then let us  rest  this Debate and either resolve to let  fall  an unconfiding and cold Correspondence or much rather agree if you please to understand one another  better  for the futureAs to my own Part I never  will  I never  did  disoblige you  unprovok'd  And if how unkindly soever impell'd I write or do any thing unbecoming the OccasionThink of me as I would of your Enemies  In the mean time let even the little Trouble you have so kindly allow'd me to give you in the Inclos'd be receiv'd as some Proof that I know and respect at my Heart your double Claim both in  Morals  and  Genius  For you know  me  I am sure much less justly if you can imagine me capable of corresponding with an Air of  Goodwill  where I wanted a  personal Attachment  or of begging as I now very earnestly do upon  any  Inducement but the high Sense I have of your  Skill  your frank and friendly  Inspection of the Tragedy  It would charm me to have the Benefit of your Hand or your Hints before it appears on the  Theatre  As to my  Essay on Propriety  you have obligingly convinc'd me I may lay it before you without Pain Indeed if I had made it unfit for  your  Eye the  World  would have been still less likely to see it I shall punctually obey your Command neither to  omit  nor to  soften  in the Transcript It is an Injunction I may safely comply with since if I have any thing to value myself upon in this Tract it is from the Proofs you will find it abound in that some of your most retir'd and most delicate Touches have been chiefly the  Search  and the  Subject  of  SIR  Your truly affectionate and most humble Servant A HILL  LETTER XXXVI From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  April  SIR  HAVING seen a Letter you wrote to my Friend Mr  Mallet  on  Saturday  last tho' I cannot boast the Honour and Happiness of your Acquaintance and ought with the utmost Deference and Veneration to approach so supreme a Genius yet my full Heart is not to be repress'd by Formalities and you must allow me the Pleasure of pouring forth my best Acknowledgments  I will not affect a moderate Joy at your Approbation your Praise It pleases it delights it ravishes me Forgive me for the Lowness of the Truth when I vow I'd rather have it than the Acclamations of Thousands 'Tis so sincere so delicate so distinguishing so glowing and what peculiarly marks and endears it so beautifully generous  That great Mind and transcendent Humanity that appear in the Testimony you have been pleas'd to give my first Attempt would have utterly confounded me if I had not been prepar'd for such an Entertainment by your wellknown Character which the Voice of Fame and your own masterly Writings loudly proclaim  It would both be disingenuous and rudely unjust in me after what you have observ'd to dissemble my Satisfaction at several Passages in the Poem This let me say that your Reflections have enter'd into the very Soul of my Purpose and even to myself cast a Light over the Whole  How rare how happy is it to find a Judge whose discerning Goodness overlooks the Faults of what is  well meant at the same Time that his fine enthusiastic Taste improves the Beauties  To you alone it belongs to write so inimitably and to read so indulgently  If I wrote all that my Admiration of your Perfections and my Gratitude dictate I should never have done but left I tire you I'll for the present rather put a Violence on myself Only let me cherish one Hope furtherof being some time or other admitted into the most instructive and entertaining Company in the World I am with the greatest Devotion  SIR  Your most oblig'd and most faithful humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  LETTER XXXVII From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  April  SIR  I Receiv'd yours with a Soul awaken'd all to Joy Gratitude and Ambition There is such a noble Excellence of Mind so much uncommon Goodness and Generosity of Heart in every thing you say as at once charms and astonishes me  As you think imagine and write with a diviner Warmth superior to the rest of Mankind so the very Praises you bestow bear the Stamp of Eminence and reflect stronger on yourself  While I meditate your encouraging Lines for a while I forget the Selfishness Degeneracy and Cruelty of Men and seem to be associated with better and more exalted Beings  The  Social Love  of which you are so bright an Example tho' it be the distinguishing Ornament of Humanity yet there are some illnatur'd enough to  degrade it into a Modification of Selflove according to them its Original  Those Gentlemen I am afraid mingle their Tempers too much with their Speculations  Selflove is indeed indispensably necessary for the Wellbeing of every Individual but carries not along with it an Idea of moral Beauty and Perfection whereas Social Love is of quite another Nature the just and free Exercise of which in a particular manner renders one amiable and divine The accomplish'd Man I admire the honest Man I trust but 'tis only the trulygenerous Man I intirely love Humanity is the very Smile and Consummation of Virtue 'tis the Image of that fair Perfection in the Supreme Being which while he was infinitely happy in himself mov'd him to create a World of Beings to make them so  The Excellent ones of the Earth in the Exercise of Social Love feel it as much to be an original Impulse as the low World that blind Affection they bear themselves nor are they in the least conscious of that forc'd cold Reasoning by which it is deduc'd from so mean an Original  How many deathless Heroes Patriots and Martyrs have been so gloriously concern'd for the Good of Mankind and so strongly actuated by Social Love as frequently to act in direct Contradiction to that of Self  A great many more Arguments might be adduced to prove that Social Love is a nobler independent Principle by itself were not the secret Sense that every good Man has of the Matter instead of a thousand  Your Writings while they glow with innumerable Instances of strong Thinking and sublime Imagination are peculiarly mark'd with this beautiful Benevolence of Mind and 'tis that which at this time has awaken'd in me these Reflections  I am ravish'd with the Hope you give me of your nearer Acquaintance and that it should ever prove unprofitable is as impossible as that it should not be in the highest Degree delightful to  SIR  Your most obliged and most faithful humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  LETTER XXXVIII From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  April  SIR  WHEN I reflect how truly happy I was Yesterday in your Company it is impossible for me to restrain my Sense of it from breaking out into this Acknowledgment  There is in your Conversation such a Beauty Truth Force and Elegance of Thought and Expression such animated fine Sense and chastis'd Fancy so much Dignity and Condescension Sublimity and Sweetness in a Word such a Variety of Entertainment and Instruction as is beyond all Admiration  Your Smiles have all the encouraging Power of Humanity in them What one says is receiv'd with great Taste and Indulgence and to listen to you gives one a secret and more ravishing Pleasure than to be Author of the best Things in other Company  There is downright Inspiration in your Society It enlarges and exalts all the Powers of the Soul chases every low Thought throws the Passions into the most agreeable Agitations and gives the Heart the most affecting Sentiments'Tis moral Harmony  It gives me an additional Pleasure to reflect how justly pleas'd too Mr  Savage  was  Nothing is to me a stronger Instance of the unimprovable Nature of that unhappy Creature of whom you speak so compassionately notwithstanding of the barbarous Provocation he has given you than his remaining bleak and wither'd under the Influences of your Conversationa certain Sign of a Field that the Lord has curs'd  There is none that renders human Nature more amiable than you and at the same time none that renders the greatest Part of it more contemptible And to descend from your Company and mingle with the Herd of Mankind is like  Nebuchadnezzar  's descending from a Throne to graze with the Beasts of the Field  Now I feast on Reflectionand am like a poor Man that has brought as much from a rich Entertainment with him as must sustain him for many Days afterwards  What charms and amuses me in a particular Manner is the Account you gave us of that little Seraph the young  Urania  Her elegant Turn of Mind her Innocence and Goodness in the Choice of her Subjects her Fancy Judgment and Ambition above her Years and the beautiful Struggle of the last 'tis unfair to call it Vanity occasion'd by the rude Stupidity of the  SchoolBoy  are most agreeably surprising  What you obligingly observ'd of good Company's being  Ariosto  's Fountain of Thirst is remarkably true of yoursI shall long impatiently for the farther Refreshment of it and am with the most intire Regard  Dear Sir  Your most oblig'd and most faithful humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  LETTER XXXIX From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  Oldman's Coffeehouse  May  Dear Sir  I HOPE that your uncommon Goodness will forgive me what I scarcely can forgive myself my not having hitherto answer'd the last encouraging Letter and Copy of Verses you honour'd me with  The Approbation which out of the Fulness of a beneficent Heart you are pleas'd to give me I am fond and ambitious of next to that of  Heaven  'Tis my best Reward for what I have done and a noble Incitement to go on When  you  approve my whole Soul is awak'd and charm'd  Pleasing is your Praise but severe is your Satire 'Tis particularly mark'd with exalted Sentiment and generous Contempt There is a Force in it that strikes thro' the Heart and a Majesty not to be express'd In a Word it is the unaffected Resentment of a great Mind  It is impossible for me in the Compass of this Letter to say how much I admire every particular Line yet 'tis as impossible for me to restrain myself from dwelling on some  " Smile at your vanish'd Hopeconvinc'd too late  " That Greatness dwells not always with the Great"  I feel the first Line too sensibly and the last finely insinuates the Absurdity of vulgar and hereditary Greatness  Your sinking of the Lord's unlasting Name in the Depth of Time is pleasingly and nobly just Sir  John Falstaff  sunk not with greater Alacrity in a literal Sense than they and all their Fopperies do in a metaphorical  I never read any thing more glorious than the four following Lines  " Patrons are  Nature  's Nobles not the  State  's  " And Wit's a Title no  Broad Seal  creates  " Kings from whose Bounty Wealth's chief Currents flow  " Are  poor  in Pow'r when they would  Souls  bestow"  They are the most divine Triumph of Merit and Virtue that was ever writ The best way of displaying all their Beauties is to read them a thousand and a thousand Times over  Your Description of the Courthaunting Winkobserving Bard is so natural that if I am not mistaken it may be found a Picture of some living Originals  The last Paragraph is very strongly and delicately wrought off but so favourable to me as obliges me to suppress all Sentiments save such as flow from Gratitude with which my Heart is as full as yours is with Goodness and Perfection  You have given me  Fame  and what have I to return you but the Acknowledgment of a grateful Soul  How powerfully was I charm'd with the four Acts of  Elfrid  you were so condescendingly good as to read us There is in them such a rich Assemblage of all the Excellencies of the best Poetry as is not anywhere to be found I never met before with such a Force and Dignity of Passion My Heart trembles yet when I reflect But I will not cramp my Admiration into the small Space this Letter allows  Mr  Mallet  is now gone into the Country where he justly expects to be vastly entertain'd and instructed by your Correspondence I have been somewhat melancholy since his Departure touch'd with  these pensive Emotions parting with such a Friend gives  Bounteous Creator of the tender Heart  Is there no World where Friends shall never part  Be that our future Lot and of such Bliss  Grant us an Earnest ere we die in this  I go on  Saturday  next to reside at Mr  Watts  's Academy in  Little Towerstreet  in Quality of Tutor to a young Gentleman there  Since you have been pleas'd to raise me in some measure to the new Life of your Favour let me never fall from it but frequently be allow'd the Honour of subscribing myself dear Sir  Your most obliged and most devoted humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  LETTER XL From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  June  SIR  MR  Bowman  and I are at  Long  's  Coffee house  in  Queen's Square    Westminster  and if it be consistent with your Conveniency would be glad to attend the Honour and Happiness of your Company as you shall be pleas'd to direct Mr  Mallet  left with me what they call a  Spanish  Cheese which he begs you to accept of At last I have been with the Speaker this Morning but would rather give you an Account of my Reception by Word of Mouth We beg Pardon for this Freedom which the delightful Prospect of your Company irresistibly tempts us to I am Sir with the deepest Respect  Your most obliged and most devoted humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  LETTER XLI From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  June  Dear Sir  ENcourag'd by that most divine of all Virtues your charming Goodness I frequently you see take the Liberty to address you  On  Saturday  last I wrote to you from a Coffeehouse in  Westminster  but had the Misfortune to hear you were gone out only Half an Hour before the Letter was sent  Flattering myself then with some Hopes of your Company I did not mention a Copy of Verses I receiv'd on  Friday  last from Mr  Mallet  to be prefix'd to the Second Edition of  Winter  and which I send you inclos'd That you should read them was his particular Desire in the following Terms  "Offer my Verses to Mr  Hill  's Perusal and tell him that I will not determine their Fate till I first learn his Opinion of them For I know him too nobly sincere to indulge  my  Vanity at the Expence of  your  Credit Say likewise that I will shortly venture to make use of that Permission he so generously granted me of writing to him as often as my Fear of becoming troublesome will let me"  All that I shall observe concerning them to such a finish'd Judge as you are is that their only glorious Fault if they have any is an Excess of that beautiful Benevolence of Mind which among a thousand other Things make you and him so greatly amiable  I hinted to you in my last that on  Saturday  Morning I was with Sir  Spencer Compton  A certain Gentleman without my Desire spoke to him concerning me his Answer was that I had never come near him Then the Gentleman put the Question if he desir'd that I should wait on him he return'd he  did On this the Gentleman gave me an introductory Letter to him He receiv'd me in what they commonly call a civil Manner ask'd me some Commonplace Questions and made me a Present of Twenty Guineas I am very ready to own that the Present was larger than my Performance deserv'd and shall ascribe it to his Generosity or any other Cause rather than the Merit of the Address  As the Case now is one of your infinite Delicacy will be the best Judge whether it will be proper to print these two inimitable Copies of Verses I have from you and Mr  Mallet  without such little Alterations as shall clear Sir  Spencer  of that best Satire I ever read I shall say no more on that Head for if there be any Reasons for such Alterations you will of Necessity at one Glance see them in the strongest and finest Light Only this let me add should you find that the Case requir'd some small Alterations and yet not indulge me with them I shall reckon what my Patron gave me a fatal Present'Tis a Thought too shocking to be bornto lose the Applause of the great Genius of the Age my Charter of Fame forI will not name itBut you are too good to plague me so severelyI expect this Favour from Mr  Mallet  next Post  When you honour me with an Answer for which I shall be anxious please to direct for me at Mr  Watts  's Academy in  Little Towerstreet  I am dear Sir with the most hearty Respect  Your most devoted and most humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  LETTER XLII From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  London  June  Dear Sir  I HAVE been for some Days last past in the Country else the inclos'd Sheets to which you yourself have given the greatest Sanction and Value should have waited on you ere now  It was your Approbation that gave me formerly an equally just and noble Satisfaction and the Continuance of it is my inviolable Ambition  Since I put you to the Trouble of altering your Verses I ought to give you an Account why Mr  Mallet  's were not alter'd likewiseThe Truth is he promis'd me to alter them as I wrote to you but in a following Letter told me that after several Attempts he found it absolutely out of his Power and rather than lose them I resolv'd to print them as they at first were To this Resolution your last favourable Letter in a great measure rais'd me And who that has a Soul in him could forbear to follow the Advice you give me in those generous Lines  Heedless of Fortune then look down on State  Balanc'd within by Reason's conscious Weight  Divinely proud of independent Will  Prince of your Passions live their Sov'reign still  I wish that the Declaration from my Heart with regard to you in the Preface may not be disagreeable These Sentiments I could not suppress and they are but a faint Expression of the full Esteem and Admiration I shall ever bear you  May I hope that one of the inclos'd Copies of my Poem can be acceptable to a Lady of Mrs  Hill  's fine Taste and the young Darling of the Muses  Urania    who in such a tender Age has encounter'd with all the Horrors of so rough a Description  Shall I languish out a whole Summer in the same City with you and not once be reinspir'd with your Company Such a Happiness would much brighten my Description of that Season from which to fill out this Letter I venture to transcribe the following Lines  Oft in this Season too the  Horse  provok'd  While his big Sinews full of Spirits swell  Trembling with Vigour in the Heat of Blood  Springs the high Fence and o'er the Field effus'd  Darts on the gloomy Flood with steady Eye  And Heart estrang'd to Fear his nervous Chest  The Seat of Strength bears down th'opposing Stream  Luxuriant and arrect Quenchless his Thirst  He takes the River at redoubled Draughts  And with wide Nostrils snorting skims the Wave  In your last you were pleas'd to threaten me as you term it with a long Letter I beg you would be as exact in the Execution of your Threatenings as you always are in the Performance of your Promises which shall be submitted to with the most chearful Resignation by him who is dear Sir with the utmost Devotion  Your most obliged and most obedient humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  LETTER XLIII From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  London  June  SIR  I HAD the inclos'd for you from Mr  Mallet  this Day which emboldens me to give you the present Trouble  He is so good as to promise me another Copy of Verses next Post which gives me a very great Pleasure But my Satisfaction is far from being complete so long as I am uncertain of the like Favour from you Perhaps my Forwardness if not Vanity presumes too much on your Goodness but your already wondrous Generosity in this Regard has rais'd in me an Expectation and Ambition you ought in all poetical Justice to satisfy If you knew the Gladness it would inspire into my Heart you would certainly steal a kind Hour from your more important Affairs to smile upon my I will not scruple to say reasonable FondnessBut by being importunate I shall offer an Injury to your everready Humanity  All that I shall further add is that on  Monday  next the Poem will be printed off I am Sir with the utmost Gratitude and Regard  Your most devoted humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  P S  The Press if you please shall wait your Leisure  LETTER XLIV From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  London  Oct  Dear Sir  MR  Savage  was so kind as to shew me a Letter you lately favour'd him with by which I had the true Pleasure of learning your safe Arrival at  Berwick  intended Tour and Halt at  Inverness  It is with a Mixture of Joy Pride and Confusion I read the favourable Mention you were pleas'd to make of me What unusual good Fortune has thus intitled me to your kind Regard 'Tis nothing sure but your own generous Goodness which with your other many matchless Perfections shall ever be my  Love and Wonder while Truth and Harmony are the Objects of these Passions  Every Muse every Virtue here languishes for your Return To me your Absence would be much severer if my partial Sympathy in the Happiness of my native Country did not alleviate the Misfortune I congratulate her on the Presence of such a kind Inspirer and candid Observer  There  you may chance to find in that neglected Corner of the World depress'd Merit uninform'd Beauty and good Sense cloath'd in the Rags of Language  Nothing has appear'd in Print here since your Departure unless it be some mushroomish Pamphlets Beings of a Summer's Night whose only Merit is the violent Propension with which they tend into Oblivion Memory abhors them and their Essence is to die I beg Mr  Pope  's Pardon some of whose Letters to Mr  Cromwell  were surreptitiously printed by  Curll  and yet tho' writ careless and uncorrected full of Wit and Gaiety  We have got O rare a  Rostrum  and an Orator since you left us an Orator whose pretended great Design is to restore primitive Christianity and his hopeful Candidates are all the Beaus and pretty powder'd Fellows about Town  You were a Week or two ago traduc'd by the Praises of one of our Journalists who can no more understand the Beauties of your Writings than you write to his Understanding  A new Torrent of  Italian  Farces is lately pour'd in upon us The Advertisement which just now lies before me and begins thus  "By his Majesty's Command at the King's Theatre in the  Haymarket  Tomorrow being  Friday  the st of  October  will be acted by the Company of  Italian  Comedians newly arriv'd a Comedy call'd  The Inchanted Island of Arcadia  or  Arlequin King of the Forests  c"  is such a Maze of incredible Impertinence  and promises so much Folly that it is to be presum'd the House will be very full and that too with Persons of the first Quality  May you soon return to Town resume the  Plaindealer  and if we are not devoted to Destruction restore the great dramatic Taste by that Tragedy Part of which I had the Honour and sublime Pleasure of hearing read by the finest Reader as well as the finest Author in  England  If your Business will allow me one Line please to direct for me at the Academy in  Little Towerstreet  I am  Dear Sir  Your most obliged faithful humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  LETTER XLV From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  Oldman's Coffeehouse  Monday Morn Mar  Dear Sir  THE News of your safe Arrival in Town gave me a Joy I have not felt since the Receipt of your most agreeable Letter from the North of  Scotland  But while I have not the Honour of seeing you  Westminster  is at a more gloomy Distance than  Skorurran  's snowy Top  Mr  Mallet  and I wish with the fondest Impatience the Happiness of your Company which if we may hope this Afternoon we'll wait upon you as you shall please to appoint by a short Line with the Bearer I will not make any Apology for this Freedom to one of your unbounded Goodness I am with the most inviolable Regard  Dear Sir  Your devoted humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  LETTER XLVI From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  Tuesday Dec  Dear Sir  I HAVE been almost intirely in the Country since I had the Honour of yours and of the inclos'd Papers you were so good as to send me The two or three Days since my Return to Town have been rather hurry'd than employ'd in solliciting for the Benefit of old  Dennis  Your wellknown and formerlyexperienc'd Goodness will I hope forgive me for having been so selfish as to keep your Papers so long Tho' I would have had some Objections to your undertaking the Translation of  Zaire  now that it is so affectingly done I should be very ungrateful for the great Pleasure it has given me to think of them any more In reading of  Zara  I forget what it was that I objected to  Zaire  You have heighten'd it with mere Imagination but such a chastis'd one as accords perfectly well with the nobler Fervency of the Heart The Sentiments and Reflections too rise in the Translation and glow stronger as well as the Touches of the poetical Pencil Allow me to say that in these Respects I deeply feel the Difference betwixt Mr  Voltaire  and Mr  Hill  The more generous Warmth of your Heart more animates the Scene raises the dear Tumult in the Breast and moves me much more I observ'd nothing that I wish'd alter'd but a Word here and there which are mere Trifles and not worth Regard One however I will take the Liberty to mention It is in a Speech of the first Scene which marks the Civility and Gallantry of  France    "Where Men adore  their Wives  "  The two last Words I would change into  the Fair  I imagine you smiling at my important Criticism and ready to replythat tho' the present  French  are not famous  for adoring their Wives yet those in the good old unrefin'd Days of St  Lewis  might If they do not now adore their Wives they perhaps do better they make them easy  I shall long to renew the Pleasure your Play has given me at its Representation What Attention I can contribute to the promoting of that will greatly be its own Reward Mr  Dodington  is expected in a few Days from  Ireland  He I dare say will warmly favour it from a double Causeboth the Love of the fine Arts and his own Pleasure Had you but Players equal to those  Voltaire  had I would not doubt in this Instance the Taste of our CountrymenAlmighty Nature is everywhere the same  Soon I propose to fix in Town for the Winter during which time I hope to pass several happy Evenings in your Company Mr  Pope  earnestly wishes the same Believe me to be most affectionately and sincerely  Dear Sir  Yours  c  J THOMSON  LETTER XLVII From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  Aug  Dear Sir  UPON my Return to Town from Mr  Dodington  's Seat in  Dorsetshire  where I had for some time been I found your Letter about a Month after its Date Had it been sent me in the Country I could not have neglected till now acknowledging the Pleasure it and the Packet of Prompters you sent along with it gave me Tho' very happy in the Company where I then was yet cannot I help sincerely regretting the Loss of that Entertainment to which you was so good as to give me an Invitation With the greatest Pleasure would I have beheld and  with the greatest Zeal would I have countenanc'd to the utmost of my little Power the Revival of  Action  which seems on all our Theatres to be now both dead and rotten A Friend of mine who was there did not by what he told me soften my Loss  I was very much enlighten'd and warm'd by the Prompters upon  Action  They present no less a strong and beautiful Idea of what  Actors  ought to be than a mortifying one of what they are As the Stage is a powerful School of humane polite Morality so nothing can contribute more to barbarize the Age than the present Condition of ours There human Nature is represented in as aukward false and monstrous a Manner as the human Form was in antient  Gothic  Sculpture and Painting If that were all it might be laugh'd at and contemn'd But since it tends at the same time to confound the Head and corrupt the Heart since Crouds grow stupid or barbarous as they gaze who can consider it in that View without feeling an honest Indignation And what crowns the Misfortune is that there is no Hope of its ever being otherwise The Root of the Evil lies too deep to be pluck'd up Was there ever an equal Absurdity heard of among a civiliz'd People That such an important public Diversion the School which forms the Manners of the Age should be made the Property of private Persons who did they happen in the first Instance by an infinite Chance to be Judges of the Matter yet may transfer that Property to the most profligate tasteless and ignorant of Mankind But this alas is only one of the Pillars of that vast Temple of  Corruption  under which this Generation more than any other that ever boasted Freedom worships the dirty lowminded insatiable Idol of Selfinterest Even to this Idol is every public Work which we have the Soul to attempt made an immediate SacrificeYou see how much your  Prompters  have inflam'd me and the  melancholy Conclusion I draw from all is that I never hope to see Gentlemen of equal Genius Taste Judgment and Generosity of Heart to the Author of these Prompters at the Head of our Theatres I may however very well live to see all Poetry reduced to MagazineMiscellanies all Plays to Mummery Entertainments and in short all Learning absorb'd into the Sink of hireling scurrilous NewsPapers Pardon this Supposition in a Letter to one who while he I ves will never suffer it wholly to take Place In the mean time go on to stem the Torrent of Barbarism I wish you could find an Assistant tho' never so weak a one in  Dear Sir  Your most affectionate humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  LETTER XLVIII From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  May  Dear Sir  IT is far from being the want of a due Sense of the Honour your two last Letters did me that has prevented my thanking you for them before now The Truth is they plung'd me so deep into your Debt that I was dispirited thro' mere Despair of clearing it But now I am rather willing to declare myself an irrecoverable Bankrupt than any longer neglect to acknowledge the refin'd Pleasure which your generous Approbation of my late Performance gives meI call it generous that Epithet having a peculiar Relation to whatever you do besides I cannot help being afraid that it must in a great measure proceed from so humane a Cause In the mean time however that be I will avow that I am justly proud of charm'd with and most agreeably rewarded by your good Opinion of my Poem Allow me here  by the bye to remark that tho' Poets have been long us'd to this trulyspiritual and almost only Emolument arising from their Works yet I doubt much if Booksellers have any manner of Relish for it I think therefore notwithstanding that the Ghosts of many Authors walk unreveng'd of annulling the Bargain I made with mine who would else be a considerable Loser by the Paper Printing and Publication of  Liberty  As I shall in this Case be possess'd of the intire Property of it again I propose in a Year or two hence to give a new Edition of it and beg that you would ere then enrich me with some Criticisms which I hope I shall have the Grace to relish as well as Praises  Your Observation with regard to political Corruption like natural when come to a Crisis producing more exalted Scenes of Animation is fine and pleases by the future Prospect it opens but it awakens at the same time a Sentiment no less mortifying should we find our Lot cast in the Times of Putrefaction should we find ourselves devoted in an antiheroic Manner for the Good of Posterity I wish heartily that I could refute what you likewise observe with regard to the Cause of this Corruption Certainly the kind Exchanger of the Superabundance for the Sweets and Elegancies of Life is itself corrupted and its Gifts abus'd from the want of Taste For whence is it save the Want of Taste that the continual Tides of Riches pour'd in upon this Nation by Commerce have been lost again in a Gulph of ungraceful inelegant inglorious Luxury But whence you will say this want of Taste Whence this sordid Turn to cautious Timeserving Moneymaking sneaking Prudence instead of regardless unfetter'd Virtue To private Jobs instead of public Works To profitable instead of fine Arts To Gain instead of Glory In a Word to the whole venal System of modern Administration And to  those gross perishing Luxuries that reconcile at once Avarice and Profusion centering all in Self and even in the meanest the material Part of Self This Disquisition I am afraid would very near lead me back again to your Observation It must be own'd however that the better Genius of this Nation has often nobly exerted itself and will struggle hard before it expire With regard to Arts and Learning one may venture to say that they might yet stand their Ground were they but merely protected In lieu of all Patrons that have been are or will be in  England  I wish we had one good Act of Parliament for securing to Authors the Property of their own Works and that the Stage were put upon the Footing of common Sense and Humanity And can it be that those who impress Paper with what constitutes the best and everlasting Riches of all civiliz'd Nations and of all Ages should have less Property in the Paper so enrich'd than those who deal in the Rags which make that Paper Can it be that the great the delightful School of Manners should be abandon'd to common Sale and become the Property of any one who can purchase it to be perhaps the School of Folly and CorruptionA Simony this in  Virtue  which if not so wicked yet is as pernicious as that in  Religion  What would  Athenians  have said to this what Laughter what Contempt what Indignation would it have rais'd among them  Now that I mention the Stage I must still insist upon my Copy of that only humane new Entertainment I have seen upon it of late I know not what  Gothic  Devil possess'd the Maid at my Lodgings but my few Books must not be so robb'd of the Honour of boasting  Zara  among them from its Author Having been tantaliz'd lately by seeing you at a Distance I wish you would be so good as to make me Amends some Evening and let me know of it a few  Days before Mr  Pope  was the other Day inquiting kindly after you I should be glad we could at the same time engage him Poor Mr  Savage  would be happy to pass an Evening with you his Heart burns towards you with the eternal Fire of Gratitude But how to find him requires more Intelligence than is allotted to Mortals Life is too short to lose Years without the Conversation of those one most loves and esteems one of which Number you must ever be to dear Sir  Your most affectionate humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  P S  Please to direct to me in  KewLane    Richmond    Surrey  and order your Letter to be put into the General Post  LETTER XLIX From Mr THOMSON To AARON HILL  Esq  Friday Morning  Dear Sir  I AM sorry that my present Hurry cannot allow me Time to answer your kind and excellent Letter in the Manner it deserves The Freedom of your Criticism I love and am more proud of your Approbation than it becomes me to say In one the Taste of Fame is not more delicious than that of Friendship in the other  You in the last Paragraph of your Letter prescribe me a glorious Task to perform which would demand the same elegant and powerful Pen that prescrib'd it Only to attempt it is my Ambition  Please to accept of the Second Part of my Poem and believe me to be with the most affectionate Esteem dear Sir  Your most obedient humble Servant JAMES THOMSON  LETTER L From Mr BOOTH To AARON HILL  Esq  Charlesstreet  Mar  SIR  'TIS plain that Affairs of much greater Consequence have prevented your Inquiry about  York  Stock I find now how much better you have employ'd your spare HoursYou have been attempting to make Mankind what they ought to be The Advice you have lately given to such who deserve the Names of Poet and Patron is a sufficient Proof of that public Spirit which ever  did  and ever  will  appear in all your ActionsGive me Leave to thank you for the vast Delight I receiv'd in the Perusal of that daring Flight from the warm Indignation of your MindWhat an everlasting Reproach have  you  justly thrown upon those  Great ones  whom Fortune has plac'd high above their Fellowcreatures and in some Sense even above their SuperiorsA Panegyric would be a vain Attempt the Poem itself can best speak its PraiseI confess I could not possibly resist the natural Impulse of expressing my Transport upon this great OccasionYou  force  me to write to you tho' Writing by no means agrees with my DistemperYour Time is preciousThink no Man living has a warmer Regard for the uncommon Qualities that are peculiar to Mr  Hill  than  SIR  Your most obliged and most humble Servant B BOOTH  LETTER LI From Mr BOOTH To AARON HILL  Esq  Monday Nov  SIR  I HAVE with infinite Pleasure finish'd the reading of your Tragedy I don't wonder Mr  Pope  should say upon the Perusal of it that no Play had ever  more warm'd  him I wish we had a Set of Actors capable of doing it the Justice it deserves  You were pleas'd to tell me that you had Thoughts of my Wife for  Elfrid  I was apprehensive not having read it that the Part might require great Force and be too powerful for her Voice But I find 'tis neither long nor violent and as our Company stands I think she might undertake it  When I told her you had been pleas'd to name her for it she blam'd me for not letting her know it that she might have thank'd you for your good Opinion of her She now desires me to tell you she is highly oblig'd to you and if you still continue in that Opinion she will do you all the Justice that lies in her Power  Next time your Affairs bring you into CoventGarden I should be proud to kiss your Hands I am  SIR  Your most faithful and most obedient Servant B BOOTH  LETTER LII From Mr BOOTH To AARON HILL  Esq  Sunday Morning  SIR  I HAD answer'd yours last Night but it came to my Hands as I was dressing about Half an Hour before the Play began  I confess I am under some Difficulty how to account for the Failure of so good a Play But notwithstanding its present Reception I am positively and absolutely of Opinion that after it has slept some time it will appear again upon the Stage with a much better Grace and continue in the Stock in the first Form of Tragedy for ever My Reasons for this are as follow  If you please to remember I hinted to you that as the Town has been lately led and manag'd there was a kind of Necessity to form and prepare a strong Body to support even its real Merit in the first Run of it and I have often thought the best Tragedy not supported by this necessary scandalous Artifice would naturally sink in five or six Days at most The Fate of  K H  has sufficiently confirm'd that Opinion  However tho' there is a good deal in what is abovemention'd I take the main Cause of its Failure to proceed from what follows  I find by some few Persons who are highly pleas'd with that noble Simplicity and Decency that runs quite through the Play that the Multitude in general look on it not as a  new  Play but as a Play  alter'd  from  Shakespear  The many Beauties you have improv'd from him and some noted Speeches you have made use of with no very material Alterations which was certainly well judg'd have possess'd the gross Imaginations of the Audience that most of the fine Passages of your own are his too the two Speeches of  Justice  and  Mercy  at the CouncilTable and  Harry  's Reflection when he first hears of the Treason are universally mistaken for  Shakespear  This I have found from some whose Education Understanding and Acquaintance with  Shakespear  I imagin'd might have taught 'em better And yet their knowing his Manner of Writing so well perhaps might the sooner lead 'em into the Mistake  Add to this that some Understrappers of  Parnassus  and the Partizans of t'other House have improv'd this Notion of its being a Play of  Shakespear  's not  very much  alter'd Now Sir allowing what I have observ'd above to be certainly the Game play'd upon K  H  I can no longer wonder that his Success is little more than what a good reviv'd Play commonly meets with  Far be it from me to profane K  H  with odious Comparisons but give me Leave to observe to you that  C  r  once brought the  Double Gallant  upon the Stage which was made up of Hints stolen from a Play of  Burnaby  's and another of  Centlivre  's both heartily damn'd the first Night many Years before as soon as the goodnatur'd Town found him out they resented his calling it a new Play and hounded it in the most outrageous Manner Two Years after we reviv'd it it met with most extravagant Success and it has continu'd in the Stock ever since and never fails of a great Audience  The  Kind Impostor  tho' taken I mean the Hints only from a Translation of a  Spanish  Play acted about Thirty Years ago was damn'd at its first Appearance only because it was call'd a new Play but was reviv'd some time after and met with universal Approbation like the former and is generally acted twice every Year  King Lear  and  Timon of Athens  met with the same Fate from the same Reasons at their first Appearance but have both prov'd excellent StockPlays upon their being reviv'd  Thus if it can be artfully insinuated to the Town that the Managers or an Author would pass an  alter'd  Play upon 'em for a  new  one  That  alone would make 'em outrageous after three or four Days and give the Multitude an Opportunity which they never let slip of exerting their proper Qualities Audiences  are never guided by Reason but always by Prepossession  I believe when you fairly consider what I have said to you the present Disappointment will give you less Surprize I assure you the Play was more applauded the second Night than the first because it was infinitely better acted As to my own Part the Concern I was under for the Success of it the first Night threw me into the utmost Confusion I should be extremely pleas'd if you would give yourself the Trouble of seeing it acted Tomorrow Night Come but behind the Scenes and we will place you in some Corner where you shall be invisible to the Audience Dear Sir let me prevail upon you to come I like your Preface there is a very decent Scorn and a mettled Contempt of the Town in it You have hinder'd me from going to Church this Morning and I have tir'd your Patience to be reveng'd of you I am Sir with the utmost Regard and Sincerity  Your most faithful and most obedient Servant B BOOTH  Richard the Third  had the same Fate with the other alter'd Plays  LETTER LIII From Mr BOOTH To AARON HILL  Esq  Charlesstr  June  SIR  WERE I not well assur'd that Mr  Hill  is the bestnatur'd Gentleman living I should not expect a favourable Answer to the Request I now make to him in behalf of Mr  V  r  I know you have sufficient Reason not to be pleas'd with the Taste of the Town which is as it always was and as it ever will beMr  Betterton  observ'd to me many Years ago that  Don Carlos  succeeded much better than either  Venice Preserv'd  or the  Orphan  and was infinitely more applauded and follow'd for many YearsWe know what Reception  Paradise Lost  met with in the Author's LifetimeIn short  Rome  and  Athens  were full as partial or rather heedless in observing the Merit of living Authors as  London  In the former City  Fannius  had more Hearers than  Horace  In the latter City  Euripides  so justly admir'd by all Posterity could not stand the Ridicule of  Aristophanes  but chose to die in voluntary Banishment to avoid the Flouts of the People and we may conclude that  Sophocles  himself escap'd the Burlesque of that Buffoon Comic for such he was notwithstanding his Merit in other Respects only because he was a Man of Quality and FortuneSo that upon the Whole I may venture to affirm that Posterity only will do Justice to Mr  Hill  who was ever above the low Artifice of forming Cabals to support his ReputationMr  Addison  was so sensible of this Truth that he took  whole Years  to bespeak and court Friends in order to secure the Success of  Cato  And is it not thus with Preferments in general both civil and ecclesiastical Do not the Meritorious fail while the industrious LevéeHaunter runs away with the Prize  I take the Liberty of saying thus much to you upon this Subject because I have been told you are determin'd to write no more for the Stage I confess I would a little soften that Resolution if I could in regard to Mr  V  r  and hope to prevail upon you to touch up his Tragedy and make it fit for the Stage And when I assure you that your Assistance in this Affair may be a Means to make him easy and happy in his Circumstances I flatter myself that your generous Disposition will need no other Motive to engage you in so good an OfficeI am dear Sir with much Respect and Sincerity  Your most obedient humble Servant B BOOTH  LETTER LIV From Mr BOOTH To AARON HILL  Esq  Charlesstr  Dec  SIR  I AM every way oblig'd to you and shall ever acknowledge your Favours  As to the Affairs of the Playhouse Half a Dozen such Farces as  The Devil in the WineCellar  and one Pantomime would restore  DruryLane  But where shall we find them I long to talk with you on this Subject and upon another of much greater Consequence to me I mean my Health I have not forgot the Drops you brought me but I durst not take them at that Time because I dreaded the Colic which has now left meYou are sensible Sir to what little Purpose it is to talk of Jaundices overheated Blood Obstructions  c  unless it be with the Unhappy who have felt those DistempersTill I was sick myself I had as confus'd a Notion of the Disorders occasion'd by a Fever as the  Deaf  have of  Sounds  or the  Blind  of  Colours  I know Mr  V  r fancies  I could  act  I pleas'd but he is mistakenat least he thinks I could  speak  a  Prologue  but he is mistaken in  that  tooI have often told him I am not ableand that I am so unhappy at this Time is a double Affliction to me because Mr  Hill  seems to  wish  I would do it in so engaging a Manner that all Excuses but that of Incapacity would be unpardonable  I had answer'd yours sooner had I not been prevented from writing by this open warm Weather which is too apt to discompose me A hard Frost agrees best with me  I have a thousand Things to say to you You will pardon me if I flatter myself with the Hopes of seeing you shortly I am Sir with utmost Respect and Sincerity  Your most obliged and most humble Servant B BOOTH  P S  I could be lavish in the Praises of your TragedyIf it meet not with deserv'd Success we must hereafter regale our Audiences as the Ghost in the  Libertine  does  Don John  and his Companions with the Liquor they most delight in  LETTER LV From Mr WILKS To AARON HILL  Esq  Feb  SIR  FROM the Observations you have been pleas'd to make of the Conduct Sentiments and Diction of  Eurydice  permit me to say that without Exception I think you the best Judge of Dramatic Performance in all its Branches I have ever known It were to be wish'd that every Spectator had your Penetration and could so justly distinguish the different Passions and the Manner of working 'emNo Actor then could hope for a favourable Reception but from his Endeavours upon all Occasions to copy Nature But alas the Taste in general is so deprav'd that there is little or no Applause to be gain'd in Tragedy but at the Expence of  Lungs  I am therefore the less concern'd that by the Course of Years I have Reason to think myself so near my  Exit  I should be proud however of an Opportunity to tell you how much I am  SIR  Your Admirer and obliged humble Servant R WILKS  LETTER LVI From Mr WILKS To AARON HILL  Esq  Bowstr  Sept  SIR  I HAVE read your Play with vast Pleasure and Mr  Cibber  highly approves of it but if  Athelwold  be the Part you design for me I have too much Reason to fear that 'tis next to impossible at my Time of Day to do it common Justice and if I decline it from a thorough Conviction of my own  Insufficiency which is truly the Case I am sure I may depend upon your Justice and Goodnature to excuse me  I should be very sorry after some little Success in my Business to run the Hazard of falling under your Censure by a very weak Performance of so capital a Part which requires not only more Youth and Vigour than I am Master of but all the Requisites that are necessary to form a complete Actor  If you will be pleas'd to let me know in what Manner you design to cast it I will order the Parts to be writ out immediately that it may be ready for acting about the Time you mention I am  SIR  Your most obliged and most obedient humble Servant R WILKS  LETTER LVII From Mr WILKS To AARON HILL  Esq  Bowstr  Oct  SIR  IF I said any thing about the Part of  Athelwold  that amounted to a Promise it was from the strong Desire which I had to appear in a Play so highly and so deservedly recommended but to  my greater Mortification  I find that the Affair of Tragedy at least for any Continuance is over with me I may perhaps rub thro' my Parts in Comedy but daily Experience teaches me that it is absolutely out of my Power to support the Weight of such a Character as  Athelwold  during the Run of a new Play that I am persuaded must make its Way in spite of Prejudice  If anybody should make me the Compliment of asking why I did not appear in the Part of  Athelwold  I shall deal frankly with him as I have done with  you and tell him the true Reason and my Sentiments of the Play will be better justify'd by the Manner in which I speak of it every where  You are so obliging to ask me in case the Play were to come on without me Who else will be capable of supporting the Character of  Athelwold  Mr  Mills  with your Instructions I am sure will do it well and he must be a wretched Actor indeed who is not qualify'd to enter into the Beauties of the most difficult Part by the Assistance which you are able to give him And whoever has the Pleasure of conversing with Mr  Hill  will be fully convinc'd of this Truth I am  SIR  Your most obliged and obedient humble Servant R WILKS  P S  I am far from having chang'd my Opinion as to the Merits of the Play and I heartily wish it were as much in my Power as it is in my Inclination to act conformably to your Sentiments in every thing  LETTER LVIII From Dr BLINMAN To AARON HILL  Esq  May  SIR  I Should be glad of the Honour of renewing our Acquaintance having a very great Esteem for you I brought you once a Gold  The Medal abovemention'd was a Compliment from the  Czarina  Confort of the great  Peter Alexiowitz  by his own Order to  Aaron Hill    Esq  for a Poem call'd  The Northern Star  which he wrote in Justice to that truly Great Monarch about the Year and which had reach'd his Eye and Regard by means of some foreign Translation  Medal from the late great Empress of  Russia  So if you please to appoint any Place and direct to Doctor  Blinman  at Mr  Williams  's overagainst  White  's Chocolatehouse  St James  's I shall be ready to meet you who am with all Respect  Your most obedient humble Servant J BLINMAN  FINIS
