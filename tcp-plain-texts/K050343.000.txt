 THE Secret History OF THE Secret HISTORY OF THE  White STAFF Purse  and  Mitre    Written by a Person of HONOUR  LONDON  Printed and Sold by S KEIMER at the  PrintingPress  in  PaterNosterRow  Price Six Pence  THE HISTORY OF THE Secret HISTORY OF THE  White STAFF  c  _AS nothing is more irksom to a Sensible Man than to have his Judgment impos'd upon so nothing can be a greater Obligation to him than to be undeceiv'd The Case now before us is National it is not a single Person that is deceiv'd here but the whole Body of the People are Banter'd and made Fools of And what better Work can a Man set his Hand to for the Publick Service than to  detect these Frauds and undeceive the World  There have not been Two little Pamphlets publish'd for a long Time past which have made more Foolish Noise in the World than the First and Second Part of the  Secret History  of the  White Staff  and it is the more wonderful because as shall soon be made appear there has been no Substance or Foundation in the Matters of Fact for them or for any of the several Pamphlets which have follow'd them but that the World has been very much amus'd and impos'd upon both in the one and the other and the whole has been a meer Delusion an  Ignis Fatuus  prepar'd either on Purpose to get a Penny by the Books or to Deceive the People or both This being premis'd it seems Necessary the World should know something of the HISTORY of these Two  Secret Histories  because by having this Matter search'd a little into there will be brought to Light some Things very profitable to us in their being known tho' most absurd in themselves Things equally wonderful in the Effect which they have had among the People and equally strange in the Knavery of the Contrivers  That we may arrive to a clear Notion of what is needful to be understood concerning those Books the Matter must be  first laid down in General  Briefly  That the Book call'd the  Secret History  of the  White Staff  seems to be publish'd in Order to justifie the Conduct and clear up the Reputation of a late Great Minister of State known throughout the Book by the Title of the  Staff  or as some of the Answerers say  To raise a Dust that he may be lost in the Cloud    In doing this they run thro' many of the most Considerable Transactions of State during the Ministry of that Great Man from his first appearing in a Publick Employment or Office in Her Majesty's Houshold to the Death of the Queen and as some pretend to say artfully labours to make the  Staff  appear really a  White Staff  washing him clear from the Dirt cast upon him by the Parties who have oppos'd him and who it may be likely have as artfully endeavour'd to Blacken and Deface him clearing up sundry Actions from the suppos'd Guilt with which they are charg'd and laying the Blame on such as are really Blameworthy upon other Heads  How well they have perform'd is not the present Enquiry it is easie for Writers this Way or that Way to form a specious Tale to clear up the Characters which they would render Bright or to blacken those who they would Misrepresent But what Weight is to be put upon  such Assurances we shall see when the  Secret History  of these Books is a little farther laid down  In the mean Time it is provoking to the last Degree to see what Success these Men have had in the Trick they have put upon the Town and how universally all sorts of Men have run into the Cheat and been bubbled to accept these Romances for a true Narration and have taken the Fable for a History without enquiring into the Things whether they were impos'd upon  Yea  or  No    The few Friends of the  Staff  on one Hand albeit they were not the first who were deceiv'd yet were very soon drawn into the Snare taking the Book to be done by a Friend or perhaps by himself in order to Vindicate him to the World by setting his Actions in a true Light and casting the Blame of sundry Things which common Fame laid at his Door upon the Conduct of divers other Persons perhaps the nearness of some Passages which they found in these Books to what they knew something of in the Conduct of the  Staff  or their willingness to have it be as it was there represented and their Passion to have others think as favourably of the  Staff  as they did themselves might concur to Deceive them forasmuch as divers Things taken Notice of in those Books  might have some Connexion with other Passages which were really true so that it would be easie for Men to be led aside at their first View of Things Also the Part these Men took with the  Staff  in his Resentment of the Conduct of those who had dispossess'd and supplanted him at Court bore no small Share in their Credulity being very willing that all imaginable Indignities should be offer'd to those who had been so successful in their Opposition to the  Staff  as to cast him out of his Seat and to dispossess him of the Favour of his Prince and to see them expos'd to all the World who had expos'd him in such a Manner which as they said was not to be forgiven  The Enemies of the  Staff on the other Hand  seem'd to be mov'd so much at the Attempt made to clear up his Character in Things which they seem to have unanswerably laid to his Charge as that they could not let slip so fair an Opportunity which seem'd to them to offer itself in this Book to load him with farther Infamy and tho' at the first View they found themselves capable to detect the  Falsity  and  Sophistry  of the Books themselves as it is express'd in some of their Answers yet they could not avoid the Snare of taking the Books for Genuine and for a Design of  the  Staff  to start something into the World in his own Vindication  The Writers of the Books sitting still all this while had their leisure to Laugh at Mankind and to please themselves with thinking how either Side fell into their Snare and bought up many Thousands of the Books which as shall presently be shewn was the  Summa Totalis  of the Design and to see with what eagerness the Party Writers on every Side carried on the Paper War which they had rais'd and which confirms the Truth of what is here asserted beyond all Contradiction It shall appear that the same People employing other Hands have been the Editors not only of the Books themselves but also of several of the Answers to these Books causing the deceiv'd People to Dance in the Circles of their drawing while these have enjoy'd the Sport of their own Witchcraft and like the Hangerson of the Camp have taken the Spoil of the Field of Battle as well of the Victors as of the Vanquish'd  It was but a few Days past when coming casually into a Publick CoffeeHouse and finding the whole Discourse  as for some Time it was  carried on by opposite Parties upon the Subject of these Books I joyn'd my self to the Company where it was warmly enquir'd into who should be  the Author or Authors of these Books I found One Man who appear'd as a Quaker and spoke as a Quaker altho' as I afterwards understood he was not a thorough Quaker maintaining a Point which differ'd from all that had spoken about it and which put me upon further enquiring into the Matter than I had done before  '  Verily  says the Quaker I  think  that ye err much about this Matter and I plainly perceive that ye do not Judge rightly of the Persons concerning whom ye are Discoursing'  Why  said his Neighbour who was his Opposer Do'st not thou think that the Earl of  Oxford  has written this Book  Quaker  Nay I do not believe it  Neigh  You Quakers are so full of double Meanings no Man can talk with you do you not believe that he has done it or caus'd it to be done that he has employ'd others to do it for him  Quak  If thou canst not talk with me then should'st thou hold thy Peace I am a Friend to the Truth and a Lover of those that speak uprightly neither have I any double Meaning in my Speech  Neigh  Answer me directly Don't you believe that he has done it I say or caused it to be done for him  Quak  I do not  Neigh  Don't you believe that he has furnish'd Materials for this Book to  Daniel De Foe  or some such other Scribler as for Money he might get to do such a Piece o  Drudgery for him  Quak  I know not Lord  Oxford  neither do I know  Daniel De Foe  but this may serve thee for an Answer to thy Question▪ that I do not believe either Lord  Oxford  or any one for him had any Concern in Writing or Composing those Books  Neigh  Pray let us hear your Reason for it  Quak  Nay now thou ask'st of me a Question which I am not under any Obligation to comply with thee in  Neigh  That is true but saying you do not believe a Thing without telling any Reason for it is the strongest Argument  you could bring to make us believe the contrary  Quak  I will give thee some of my Reasons but I will assure thee also they are not the chief Reasons which I might give which perchance it may not be convenient to mention at this Time  Neigh  Let us then have such Reasons as you please to give  Quak  One Reason is That if it had been done by Lord  Oxford  as thou say'st it was and that it was for his own Vindication he would not have Written that which is so unfit to perform what it is suppos'd to do and that he would have vindicated himself in a better Manner or not have meddled with it in Publick  Neigh  That is no Reason his Cause is so bad it admits no Vindication  Quak  Nay then my Reason is good in that I said he would therefore have let it alone but seeing thou dost not approve of my Reasons I have no need to trouble thee with more of them And here the Quaker seem'd to make some Motion to rise and go away  Neigh  That is just what I said before that you have no Reason at all  Quak  Thou thinkest to move me by thy Words to enter into Disputations with thee of these Things but I shall not comply with thy Desire let it therefore suffice thee that I know what I have said to be Truth the which is more than saying I believe it and herewith the Quaker rose up and departed  The Quaker's last Words stir'd up my Curiosity and I immediately follow'd him and ask'd him if he would give me an Opportunity to have a little Friendly Discourse with him that I had seen how rudely they had treated him in the CoffeeHouse but that I should let him see I had more Respect  He yielded and we went to a Publick House where being sat down I told him that had I read over the Books call'd  The Secret History of the Staff  c And that I had frequent Thoughts about them That I observ'd a great many Things which in my Opinion look like Romances that I often thought the whole was a continu'd Fiction that some Things were put in which if they  were true no Body could know but those whose Interest it was not to make them Publick That other Things were mention'd which were not probable sundry Speeches fram'd which I believ'd were never spoken and that I had long wish'd that I might one Time or other come to some Discovery of the Truth of the Case and that hearing him tho' a Stranger to me jump so exactly with my Opinion and that he seem'd to have more Knowledge of particular Circumstances than I had I was very earnest to Discourse with him about it and that I might not hinder his being as free with me as he would be with any Friend of his Acquaintance I told him my Name Place of Abode  c  and nam'd some Eminent Quakers to him whom I suppos'd he might know and who I knew would answer for my Sincerity  He heeded me very attentively and when I had ended he answer'd thus or to this Purpose  'Friend Thou seem'st to me to be a grave Person and one who art soberly searching after the Knowledge of the Truth and I think it is meet that I should inform thee of what I know concerning this Matter For albeit I was not free to answer to a forward Man whom I perceiv'd to speak  perversly to me without Cause yet I shall not refrain from thee in any Thing wherein I may assist thy Understanding of the Truth'  'I have been Curious in making enquiry concerning the Books whereof thou speakest and I may assure thee that they are no other than Fables being compos'd by Evil Persons for Lucre and Gain and that the Persons whereof those Men made mention have had no Knowledge thereof nor were concern'd in employing or directing the Writers thereof and this thou may'st be confirm'd in the Knowledge of if thou wilt as I have done make diligent Enquiry among those who are more especially employ'd in Business of this Nature'  I was surpriz'd with this Account as I might well be altho' it was nothing but what I always believ'd yet it made me still more Curious to enquire of him in what Manner he came to the Knowledge of this Thing so as to be Satisfactory and that while we believ'd the World was impos'd upon by the Books we might not suffer our selves to be impos'd upon in our Enquiry after them For said I in a Thing of this Nature I  would not take up with slight Evidence he told me  'He had been very Particular in his Enquiry and  First  That he had obtain'd of a Friend to speak of it to the Lord  Oxford  himself and that the said Lord expressing himself with the utmost Indignation at the Books themselves assur'd the Person who mention'd it to him that he had no Knowledge of them till he saw them in Print that he always was of Opinion that printed Vindications were useless Things and injurious to the Persons they would pretend to serve that he knew nothing he had done that needed any Vindication but if it were otherwise he desir'd he might be left to Vindicate himself as he found Occasion that many if not most of the Facts in these Books were False and that those which had Truth in them were mingled with such abundance of Romance as that they did not so much as appear to be dress'd up like the Truth that he dislik'd every Thing in those Books and also the Manner in which it was there plac'd and that no one could oblige him more than by letting the World know that he disown'd what was there reflecting upon others and despis'd what pretended to be in behalf of himself'  Besides this Account which was very satisfying he told me that he had been Curious to get Information among the Writers of Pamphlets to find out if he could either who had a Hand in it or who they suppos'd to have so that he had found one Friend who was acquainted with that Person who common Fame had tax'd with it in Publick and that he had obtain'd from his said Friend to go to that Person It seems he found the poor Man in a very Dangerous Condition having had a Fit of an Apoplexy and being very Weak insomuch that his Life was despair'd of but mentioning the said Books to him and that the Town charg'd him with being the Author of them and that he had Written them by Direction of the said Lord  Oxford  the said Person answer'd That they did him a great deal of Wrong neither did he believe that the Lord  Oxford  was any Way concern'd directly or indirectly in the said Books and that he believ'd his Lordship had never heard of them till they were publish'd It was true he said that he happen'd to see some of the Copy while it was at the Press and that being desir'd to look upon it he did Revise Two or Three Sheets of it and mark'd some Things in them  which he dislik'd but for the rest he could safely Swear he never saw them or knew what was in them till after they were printed nor did he know whether the Things which he had mark'd as above said were alter'd in the Print  Yea  or  No    The Person who went to him then ask'd him if he did not believe that they were written at the Desire and by the Directions of People who traded in such Books and who did it meerly to get Money by them without any other Design this Way or that Way respecting the Parties or Divisions of the People And he answer'd  He did verily believe it was so    My Friend told me he could not question the Truth of what a Man as it were stepping into the Grave had so freely declar'd and that he thought Men could not answer charging Things Publickly upon others without any Proof of them saving what was suggested to them by the Surmises of their own Evil Thoughts or of other Evil Persons and he did not know how Men could answer wronging others in such a Manner  But that which farther than all this confirm'd this Quaker  as he said  in his beleiving that it was not either of the Persons abovemention'd who had written these Books was a farther Information which he told me he had met with from Two several Persons  who as he said  were of the Tribe of Writers who are by the World call'd  Hackneys  as before who gave him some Account how these Books were manag'd and by whom  There are it seems  said he  several Clubs or Setts of these Men who are kept in constant Employment by the Booksellers or Publishers of Pamphlets to Write on such and such Subjects as the said Booksellers shall direct and these said Booksellers or Publishers joyn together their Stocks when such Books are written to pay as well the Charge of Writing as of Printing the same and then unite their Interest in their way of Trade for the more effectual vending the said Books And I am assured  said he farther  That these Persons do not Consult the Side or Party on which or in whose behalf the said Books may be suppos'd to plead but the great Thing which they regard is that the said Books  may Sell  and if they  find it sells so as to answer their Design they go on perhaps to employ the same Persons to write an Answer or Answers thereto and that he was satisfy'd by his Friend that these Books of the  White Staff  were written by some of these Men call'd  Hackneys  as aforesaid and by the Order of and for the Wages given by some of the said Booksellers Publishers  c  And that no other Persons or Designs were to be found concern'd therein  I told him this was a very Infamous Practice if it was true but desir'd to know if he had good Grounds to believe the same He told me he thought he had sufficient Ground to believe that there were such People and that there were such Setts of Men who employ'd these Writers and of this he had such Evidence that as he said he was able to name several Men who were so employ'd and also those who did employ them he likewise told me he was assur'd of their doing this upon the single View of gaining by the vending or selling their Books without any other Design not being concern'd what Cause or what Principle these Men writ for or upon seeing as he was inform'd it was their frequent Practice to employ one Man or Sett  of Men to write a Book upon this or that Subject and if that Book succeeded that is to say if it Sold well then to employ others or perhaps the same Hands to write Answers to the same Book And to confirm this he told me he could assure me that the Book entitled the  Purse  and the  Mitre  which was written in Opposition to the former Book the  Staff  were written by the Order and at the Expence of the very same Men who had before caus'd the said  Secret History of the White Staff  to be written that the Writer or Hackney who was thus employ'd was one  Pittis  of whom more shall be spoken afterwards  And that albeit they were publish'd by a different Hand the Principals were the very same and they were Publish'd and Sold on the Account of the same Sett of Booksellers and this he said he was able to give sufficient Testimony to the Truth of if there were any Occasion  I was more surpriz'd with this last Part of his Account than I was with the other and could not conceal the Astonishment I was in thereat which made him take the Liberty to tell me that he admir'd to see those Things seem strange to me for that  he said this had been the constant Practice of these People for some Years and that most of the Libels which had been publish'd for some Years past had been written in this Manner and that the great Mistake which he observ'd to be in it was not that such Men were suffer'd to Write for that he did not see how any Laws could be made to restrain them but that which was to be wonder'd at was the Folly of the People who suffer'd themselves to be amus'd with every  Jack with a Lanthorn  and who by laying such stress upon what they read in every Pamphlet gave a Weight to them when they had not any in themselves and fancying that this or that Great Person had set his Head or Hand to work to write these Things they made them thereby effectual to do that Evil which they were Originally not design'd to do and which if they were let alone they would not be able to do  I joyn'd with him in his Opinion of all these Things and farther it caus'd divers Reflections in my Thoughts upon the Folly and Absurdity of those who have pretended to write weighty and solid Answers to these Books entitled  The History  of the Staff  c how some call it the Work of the late Lord Treasurer and take the Liberty from thence to answer that Book as his Lordship Performance casting the Follies and Ignorance the Malice and ill Manners of a few three halfpenny Scriblers in the Face of his Lordship as his own▪ if there are false Grammars they are call'd his Ignorance and want of Learning false Facts they are call'd his Lies shuffling and quibling with the Arguments which were necessary because they knew little of what they were speaking is call'd his  Sophistry  not only abusing the Person on whom these Things are cast but likewise abusing very notoriously the Readers by making them believe that these Things are of Moment which are the Conceptions of silly Mercenaries drawn from what they pick'd up in Fragments here and there▪ from the CoffeeHouse Chat and learned AleBench Discourse of this City and then fram'd together in a Book to deceive the credulous Heads and inquisitive Tempers of the People and pick their Purses of a little Money  But that no Man may question the Truth of what is here affirm'd the Write  of these Sheets avers and is able on Occa+sion to make Oath That the said Mr  Pittis  own'd and acknowledg'd to him the said Writer of these Sheets that he was the Author of the said Book call'd the  Mitre  and  Purse  and shew'd me Part of the Copy in Manuscript before the same was printed neither is this all but the Writer of these Sheets avers That he can prove who employ'd the said Mr  Pittis  and what Hire or Price he receiv'd for the Work  This is mention'd with the more Plainness because of a like Case which has just now happen'd and is made Publick by  Pittis  himself and is as followeth Mr  Pittis  has been taken up for writing a Pamphlet call'd  Reasons for a War with France  which Book he has own'd he was hir'd to Write by that Conscientious Bookseller so celebrated for his Honesty Mr  Edmund Curl  in  Fleetstreet  who was one of his Bail upon which he gives out an Advertisement in several of the Newspapers that a Book was preparing for the Press entitled  Reasons against a War with France  by the Author of the  Mitre  and  Purse  which as is said above appears to be the same Author  viz  Mr  Pittis  This so evidently proves the Practice above of Mr  Curl  and his Associates Writing for and  against that no Men can be so wilfully Obstinate as not to be convinc'd  Now to return from this Digression the Quaker told me many more Things which I have not room to take Notice of here but he was particularly warm when he discours'd of the Use which we made of these Books  'The People of this City says he are all  true Believers  for they can believe every Thing which pleases them and call every Thing which they do not approve of false If  thou  continu'd he shouldst go among them and tell them that the History of the  White Staff  was not written by Lord  Oxford  or by some of his Emissaries they would laugh thee to scorn on the other Hand shouldst thou say unto them that the History of the  Purse  and  Mitre  was not written by the Instigation of the Priest of  Rr  or of the late high Man thou call'st  Chancellor  but that this last was written by the Hire and by the Directions of the same Persons who were in that respect the Authors of the other they would be displeasd with thee in a grievous Manner and these Things would seem unto them as idle Tales yet in Truth thou may'st be assur'd  said he  it is no otherwise and Time will farther satisfie thee of these Things nay I am credibly inform'd  saith he That some of thy People have been so wicked as to affirm that these Books were written by other Persons and to Name those Persons whereas it is certain that they could not be able to prove one Tittle thereof which  said he  is a worse Offence than any of those which they take Liberty to reprehend for this  said he  is the greatest Affront offer'd to Truth that Men are capable to offer And they ought in the first Place to enter upon the Demonstration of the Fact which they assert  to wit  That Lord  Oxford  or some one for him or by his Direction hath written and publish'd the said Tracts before they enter'd upon the Subject of the said Book forasmuch  said he  as if it be not a Verity which they have first laid down  to wit  That the said Books were written by him or by his Knowledge and Direction or if it be a Verity as I am perswaded thereof that he had no Knowledge of the said Books before they were written and publish'd then it is Folly and Shame unto them who have engag'd themselves to answer the same as if written by him wherefore also all which they have said upon those Subjects afterwards falleth to the Ground by Reason that the same is built upon a wrong Foundation  Likewise  saith he  if it appeareth that they have been thus easily deceiv'd it seemeth to me that they are also become wilful Deceivers of others in that they adventure to affirm what they know not and desire others to build upon the like sandy Foundations raising slanderous Accusations upon Persons upon Suspition of their having done what they have not in Truth been guilty of For  said he  they are false Teachers of others who are not well assur'd of the Truth of what they teach and albeit  said he  this Lord  Oxford  were an evil Man for Friend  said he  I like not his Ways neither do I approve of his Doings any more than thou may'st do howbeit I must not charge him or any other unjustly with Things whereof they are not guilty And if these Persons have affirmed that this Man hath us'd such  Sophistry  and such Dishonesty for his own Vindication as is found in the said Books and he hath not done so neither is any Way directly or indirectly concern'd therein as I have just Cause to believe he is not then have they done wickedly and deserve Reproof therefore neither can I give Credit to any of the Inferences which they draw therefrom forasmuch as right Consequences are very seldom form'd from  wrong Premises And this  my Friend said he  is my Opinion of this Matter'  Reflecting after this upon the Quaker's Discourse for we went not much farther at that time it produc'd some wonder in me at the strange Usage which Men give one another in this Age and above all it came very strongly in my Mind  Good Lord  said I What a Temper of Slander and Reproach is gone forth in the World Were we to hear some Men talk of the Books call'd the  White Staff  one cou'd hardly think but they knew for certain and were able to prove it in a Court of Justice that the Earl of  Oxford  was the Author of them or that they had seen him give the Instructions for the writing them to the Persons who he had employ'd When the Books are read over which are call'd the Answers and Considerations upon these  Histories of the White Staff  where the Persons are call'd the most scandalous Names for writing them which by this Quaker's Account have had no knowledge of them till they were publish'd What Opinion must we entertain of the Writers of these Books And how will they take off all the Weight which might otherwise be thought due to the Arguments us'd in these Books Where I see the Person who is suppos'd  to be the Original treated with such Harshness the other who is charg'd with being his Tool call'd so many Rascals and such like Names and yet in the bottom of the Case for ought I see neither of these are in the least concern'd in the original Part of the Books What shall be in Justice said to such a Practice And what Principle must these Authors have who dare thus impose upon the World in that whereof they know nothing and dare thus charge Men positively and publickly in that of which they have no Evidence but their own partial Conjectures  These Sheets have not the least Affinity to a Vindication of the Earl of  Oxford  The Undertaker hereof knows nothing of  Daniel de For  Mr  Pittis  or any other of the mercenary scribling Tribe The Question now in debate with me is Whether it be true which the Quakerabove mention'd has laid down yea or nay and in enquiring after this I have sincerely employ'd some Hours Let the  White Staff  be as black as the Devil let his Actions merit all the Reproach that good Men think their Due or that bad Men can cast upon them in fine let him be all that can be either justly or unjustly said of him yet it is certain nothing ought to be said either of  him or of any other Person which is  not true  nay nor which cannot be prov'd to be true  But neither is this the true Design of this Book for howbeit Men will take the Liberty to say of those against whom they write Things not true or perhaps Things which they have not sufficient Evidence of yet who shall go about in such a Day as this is to reprehend the Vice of our angry PartyMen shall be sure to get nothing but some of the Dirt which they were before throwing at one another to be thrown at him by both Sides and be like the Guides who brought the  Dutch  Troops into  Reading  at the Time of the Revolution who running too busie about to show the  Dutchmen  their Enemy and to mark out the Villains who were to cut their Throats were shot in the Fray by their own Friends for not standing out of the Way  But the Use that I would make of this is to admonish those who write that however they treat those Men they write against they would have some regard for those whom they write  unto  that is to say That albeit they may not regard loading those they write against with Accusations  and blackning them with Crimes whether they may be guilty or no yet that they would take care of their Friends  to whom  they write that they do not impose upon them to believe Lies and Things which have no Foundation but in the crazy prepossess'd Imaginations of a Party putting Suspicions and Conjectures upon them for Matters of Fact and prepossessing their Minds to believe a Lie  I could not but reflect with particular Astonishment upon the Book call'd the  Mitre  and the  Purse  how I found a Raging something like a Frenzy in the very Frontispiece the Man seeming to be in a poetick Fury at the Person call'd the  White Staff  he talks in his Title of the  Hypocrisy and Villany  of the  White Staff  he draws a Bill upon  Virgil  for that eminent Line which as he takes it will be very acceptable to all the Enemies of the  White Staff  viz  Quo teneam vultus mutantem protea nodo  Having also some Credit with the  English  Poets he draws another Bill upon  Dryden  in his  Absalom  and  Achitophel  which he shoots like an envenom'd Arrow directly at the  White Staff    He left not Faction but of that was left  When he enters upon his Subject he remembers what would gratifie the Town and falls upon the common Topick thus  The Mercenary that has been hir'd to raise a Dust in order to blind People's Eyes from seeing clearly into the White Staff's true Character having  c Hist of  Mitre  and  Purse  Page  A plain Man unacquainted with such Roguery would believe that Mr  Pittis  knew and could prove beyond Contradiction that the Writer of the  White Staff  was a Mercenary hir'd by the Person call'd or understood by the  White Staff  On the other Hand how would he have imagin'd that the same Persons who hir'd some other Mercenary to write the  White Staff  had hir'd him to write the  Purse  and  Mitre  and that the Stile of his first Lines which are quoted above ought if they had been written with Sincerity to have run thus  The Mercenary who we hir'd to raise a Dust in order to blind People's Eyes and make them believe the White Staff as Genuine and not a Romance having  c  The Reader may not expect I should enter into a Detail of this Writer's Language This is not an Answer to Books but a detecting the Knavery of Books and making the injur'd People of  Britain  sensible how they have been impos'd upon by several of those People call'd Booksellers On the one hand they hire a Man or Men to write a Secret History pretending to Vindicate and Defend the Character of the Person of him whom they call the  White Staff  and they bring him in making Eloquent Speeches detracting from and loading the Characters and Conduct of other Ministers of State of whom perhaps not one Word of what he is said to have spoken may be true and which is yet more not one Word of it was ever spoken by him On the other hand the same Men hire another Man perhaps the same Man to mimmick the opposite Party to fall upon the  White Staff  with all the Opprobrious Terms and all that Railery which a Person suppos'd to be injur'd by the said  White Staff  could be inspir'd with and as if he was employ'd by the  Mitre  and  Purse  to fight their Battle taking on him the Defence of their Character falls on with such unmerciful Fury as if the  White Staff  was a  Victim given up to be Sacrific'd by his Tongue to the Ghost of the HighChurch Cause lately dead and buried and when all this is said and done and when the World has been amus'd with this  Ambodexter  Scuffle thus long it appears that neither the  WhiteStaff  abusing or the  Mitre  and  Purse  abused have the least Knowledge of the Matter the Person who is charged with writing for them is Sick in his Bed and knows little or nothing of it and the  Secret History  of these  Secret Histories  is that they were Coin'd in one Mint all form'd by one and the same Sett of Men and with the same truly mercenary Design  viz  To get a Penny Not valuing who on the one hand they slander'd whom they set together by the Ears what Characters they reproach'd unjustly or whom they expos'd and on the other Hand not regarding whom they incens'd against the Persons concern'd whom they impos'd upon deceiv'd and abus'd making the poor innocent People of  Britain  to believe Lies and Things of other Men which perhaps never enter'd into their Heads or Hearts to do or say  I need now go no further into the Book it matters not what the Subject is neither what the Person is who writes it This is no Charge upon Mr  Pittis  who as the Quaker assur'd me wrote the Book call'd the  Mitre  and  Purse  the more he falls upon the  White Staff  the better is it for those who employ'd him as the more the Writer of the  White Staff  falls upon the  Mitre  and  Purse  the better for those who employ'd him the Original of these Things being the same Persons This is the  Secret History  of the  Secret History  neither is  this Tract bent against the Persons who employ'd these Writers on one side or on the other It seems it is their Trade and I have been inform'd that one Mr  Edmund Curl  has been furnish'd with Topicks out of  Lex Mercatoria  to justify and defend the Lawfulness of such an Employment which he has practis'd some Years before he intermeddled with the Books in Question These Things therefore I say are not the Aim and Design of this Book but rather to open the Eyes of the People to the main Thing  viz  That they may be made more sensible than they have yet been how grosly they are impos'd on by the Writers of Pamphlets at this time and how the great Affairs of State are canvass'd and settled or rather indeed unsettled and expos'd by such little Animals as  Curl  and his  Hacks  who write and Print whatsoever they find the People foolish enough to buy and who watch the Inclinations of the People to see what will take with and please their Humour not valuing whom they deceive or whom they expose so that they can make their Books sell off which they print and bring them to a second or third Edition  Passing then from this Part to those which follow  viz  he other Answerers of this Book perhaps there may be some who have not the same Original  viz  in the Booksellers CabinetCouncil but who take this Occasion to exert their other Vice  viz  of Prejudice against the Persons concern'd Of these we may observe how justly to be ridiculed is all their serious Railing their singling out Particulars in the History of the  Staff  their Violence and enforcing their Arguments with so much  Heat of Zeal I say how justly to be ridicul'd and expos'd are all their serious Efforts When the Truth of the Thing is that this whole Affair hath been only the Work of a few Booksellers who wanted to get a Penny That the Persons suppos'd to be concern'd therein knew nothing of the Books or had even any Hand in their Composition and that they have made Fools of themselves and of the World by fighting with a Man of Straw of other People's dressing up  It must move some Laughter surely at themselves when if they shall enquire further into the Thing  as I have done  they should arrive to an  Eclaircisment  in this Matter and to be satisfy'd that this  Jackalent  was a meer Bookseller's Romance a meer Composition of  Grubstreet  set on Work by those who neither knew the Persons they writ of nor ow'd them either ill Will or good but would have wrote the same Things for or against their own Father for the same Price  It is also very observable that in all the Books which have been publish'd either in Answer to the said Histories of the  Staff  or reflecting upon them there is not one of these which I have yet met with whose Author takes the least Care to prove that the  Staff  or the  Purse  or the  Mitre  or any one else for them or by their Order or Direction wrote or caus'd to be written any of those Books They have gotten a new Way to get over all these Things at once  viz  by charging it positively upon whomsoever they please to call the Authors expecting that their Readers should take it upon the Faith of the Answerers that such Men have written the Books they  Answer whether they offer any Evidence of it or not This is a Token either of great Impudence in the said Writers who dare impose upon the World in such a Manner upon their own Authority or of great Levity and Credulity in the  Age  who take their Intelligence of Things upon Trust and sit down with the Scandals and Slanders of Writers on any Side without Proof  But to let alone the Writers who are in themselves all of a Rank too mean and too Scandalous to have any of these Lines spent about them or that any one should be concern'd at what is or is not publish'd by them Turn we to the People abus'd by them and impos'd upon in their false Accounts of these Things it must be a particular Satisfaction to those who are affronted in these Writings whether  Staff Purse Mitre  or who else may be design'd under the pretended Characters of those Authors to be able  as I hear they do already  to assure their Friends that they are not at all concern'd in these Books which are so positively laid to their Charge Since the first Discourse which I had with the Quaker aforesaid I have met with several Persons of undoubted Reputation who have assur'd me that all those Persons who have been nam'd by those Authors  to wit  the E of  Od  late Ld  Cha  the Ld B of  R  the Ld  B  and others also do affirm upon all the sacred Things which bind Men of Honour and Christianity to speak Truth that they have been no ways concern'd in these Books either the History of the  Staff  or of the  Purse  and  Mitre    But to put this Matter out of all Question and to put to Silence the Writers who have taken upon them to publish to the World that this that and the other Person have written or caus'd to be written these said Books Entituled  The Secret History of the Staff The Secret History of the Mitre and Purse  c The Writer of these Sheets makes this brief but positive Proposal to them which if they do not accept they must be Selfcondemn'd and all Men must take their Silence for a Confession of their Guilt the Proposal is as follows  viz  Let any of the Writers who have fix'd the Writing or causing these said Books to be written upon the Person or Direction of the said  White Staff Mitre  and  Purse  bring any Evidence to prove that it was so in Fact and that the said Persons known to be meant by the said Names of the  Staff Mitre  or  Purse  did write or direct to be written or know of or consent to the Writing of the said Books or any Part or Parcel thereof or that even the said  Staff Purse  or  Mitre  or any of them did ever see the said Books or hear of them or any Part of them before they were printed and publish'd I say let them bring any Evidence other than bare Report or their own Conjectures and then the Writer of these Sheets will be confronted with and against them and will ingage himself to prove who were the Writers of the said Books or at least who were the Designers of and Employers of those who did write them and will prove by irrefragable Testimony that it was impossible any of the said Persons so represented by the Names of the  Staff  the  Mitre  and  Purse  could be concern'd in writing the same or have any Knowledge directly or indirectly thereof  These Proposals are so equitable and must be acknowledg'd so by every just Person that we might even Appeal to the Authors themselves to be the Censurers of their own Writings and if any of them are incumber'd with those Things call'd Reflections as it is fear'd much that they are not they must be brought acknowlege that they have been too credulous too forward to charge Men with Crimes which they could not prove them to be Guilty of and that they have been too willing to impose upon the Credulity of the Age insinuating to them that such and such Persons have been concern'd in such and such Things when they themselves cannot give any Evidence that it is so in Truth or Reason why the other should believe so  What Satisfaction these Men would make for slandering other Persons in such a Manner That indeed is a Thing which it is to be doubted such Men lay little to Heart the Men who can satisfy themselves to slander their Enemies and impose upon their Friends can ill be suppos'd to concern themselves in making Reparation for the Injury done to the Persons slander'd as was remark'd at the Beginning I am not concern'd to defend them let them Answer for themselves howbeit for the innocent common People who are made  to believe  a Lie by those Men for their Sakes I say it is but just that such Practices as these should be expos'd as they deserve that they may be better inform'd and may be made to  see who they are that delude and deceive them These Men when they read the several Answers to the Books call'd the  White Staff  the  Mitre  and  Purse  and therein find such and such Persons of Quality charg'd directly with writing or hiring others to write  thus  and  thus  have nothing to do but to Enquire First  How do we know that these Men did write these Things  Secondly  How doth it appear where doth the Answerer or Considerer prove the Charge  And if they find that this Charge is not prov'd or the Proof not attempted in their Writings why then all the rest is nothing but the most impudent begging the Question that has ever been known  The Writer of these Sheets is too well acquainted with the Spirit of the Men who will be offended at this Thing and that they will defend the Crime of which they are Guilty by joining thereunto another Crime that is to say they will defend one false Thing with saying another They have said already that these Books were written by such and such Persons and being able to bring no other or further Testimony thereof they will add still that they affirm it that it is and must be so But this is Popery in the most Jesuitical Branch of it covering a Fraud with a greater Fraud Protestants are come to a Point in such Things  viz  to believe nothing without some Proof If it shall be alledg'd that direct Proof cannot be obtain'd in such Cases it is reply'd to this that where positive Proof cannot be obtain'd no Fact shou'd be positively charg'd What cannot be prov'd should not be affirm'd For  Affirmanti incumbat probatio  They should with  Modesty and Caution have Argu'd if these Things are written by such and such Persons or by such and such mercenary Hirelings by their Direction then so and so  prout  in their Answers But not a Man of these Answerers and Considerers that I have met with have given themselves the Trouble to use any Measures for a Salvo to their own Reputations but have shot their Bolts like the Fool affirm'd without Probation Charg'd the Guilt without searching for the Evidence and when the World cometh to be convinc'd of this Part of what Force can all they have said after it be with any considering Person  I shall leave it upon this Issue Nothing can be more convincing to the Understanding of any Man than this These Books have been written and publish'd by Men unconcern'd in the Fact who in the Way of their Trade as Booksellers  c  have put Romances upon the World a Sett of Writers  as bad as they  have taken hold of the Subject represented therein and pretending to Answer the Books have begun with a Falshood without taking the least Pains to clear it up As they went on have charg'd the Writing upon Persons no way concern'd therein without taking one Step to prove that what they had so charg'd was true This Stumble being made at the Threshold all that they have said therein is most egregiously wicked and either false in Fact or in Consequence The Persons are injur'd and their Country abus'd and impos'd upon in a criminal and abominable Manner  FINIS
