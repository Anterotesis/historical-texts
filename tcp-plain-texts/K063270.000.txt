 VILLAGE POLITICS  ADDRESSED TO ALL THE MECHANICS JOURNEYMEN AND DAY LABOURERS  IN GREAT BRITAIN  By WILL CHIP A COUNTRY CARPENTER  MANCHESTER J HARROP PRINTER MDCCXCIII  VILLAGE POLITICS  A  DIALOUGE  between  JACK ANVIL  the Blacksmith and  TOM HOD  the Mason  Jack  WHAT's the matter Tom Why dost look so dismal  Tom  Dismal indeed Well enough I may  Jack  What's the old mare dead or work scarce  Tom  No no work's plenty enough if a man had but the heart to go to it  Jack  What book art reading Why dost look so like a hang dog  Tom  looking on his book  Cause enough Why I find here that I'm very unhappy and very miserable which I should never have known if I had not had the good luck to meet with this book O 'tis a precious book  Jack  A good sign tho' that you can't find out you're unhappy without looking into a book for it What is the matter  Tom  Matter Why I want liberty  Jack  Liberty What has any one fetched a warrant for thee Come man cheer up I'll be bound for theeThou art an honest fellow in the main tho' thou dost tipple and prate a little too much at the Rose and Crown  Tom  No no I want a new Constitution  Jack  Indeed Why I thought thou hadst been a desperate healthy fellow Send for the doctor then  Tom  I'm not sick I want Liberty and Equality and the Rights of Man  Jack  O now I understand thee What thou art a leveller and a republican I warrant  Tom  I'm a friend to the people I want a reform  Jack  Then the shortest way is to mend thyself  Tom  But I want a  general reform  Jack  Then let every one mend one  Tom  Pooh I want freedom and happiness the same as they have got in France  Jack  What Tom we imitate them We follow the French Why they only begun all this mischief at first in order to be just what  we  are already Why I'd sooner go to the Negers to get learning or to the Turks to get religion than to the French for freedom and happiness  Tom  What do you mean by that ar'n't the French free  Jack  Free Tom aye free with a witness They are all so free that there's nobody safe They make free to rob whom they will and kill whom they will If they don't like a man's looks they make free to hang him without judge or jury and the next lamppost does for the gallows so then they call themselves free because you see they have no king to take them up and hang them for it  Tom  Ah but Jack didn't their KING formerly hang people for nothing too and besides wer'n't they all papists before the Revolution  Jack  Why true enough they had but a poor sort of religion but bad is better than none Tom And so was the government bad enough too for they could clap an innocent man into prison and keep him there too as long as they would and never say with your leave or by your leave Gentlemen of the Jury But what's all that to us  Tom  To us Why don't our governors put many of our poor folks in prison against their will What are all the jails for Down with the jails I say all men should be free  Jack  Harkee Tom a few rogues in prison keep the rest in order and then honest men go about their business afraid of nobody that's the way to be free And let me tell thee Tom thou and I are tried by our peers as much as a lord is Why the  king  can't send me to prison if I do no harm and if I do there's reason good why I should go there I may go to law with Sir John at the great castle yonder and he no more dares lift his little finger against me than if I were his equal A lord is hanged for hanging matter as thou or I should be and if it will be any comfort to thee I myself remember a Peer of the Realm being hanged for killing his man just the same as the man wou'd have been for killing  him  Lord Ferrers was hanged in for killing his Steward  Tom  Well that is some comfortBut have you read the Rights of Man  Jack  No not I I had rather by half read the  Whole Duty of Man  I have but little time for reading and such as I should therefore only read a bit of the best  Tom  Don't tell me of those old fashioned notions Why should not we have the same fine things they have got in France I'm for a  Constitution  and  Organization  and  Equalization  Jack  Do be quiet Now Tom only suppose this nonsensical equality was to take place why it wou'd not last while one cou'd say Jack Robinson or suppose it cou'dsuppose in the general division our new rulers were to give us half an acre of ground apiece we cou'd to  be sure raise potatoes on it for the use of our families but as every other man would be equally busy in raising potatoes for  his  family why then you see if thou wast to break thy spade I should not be able to mend it Neighbour Snip wou'd have no time to make us a suit of cloaths nor the clothier to weave the cloth for all the world would be gone a digging And as to boots and shoes the want of some one to make them for us wou'd be a greater grievance than the tax on leather If we shou'd be sick there wou'd be no doctor's stuff for us for doctors woud be digging too We cou'd not get a chimney swept or a load of coal from pit for love or money  Tom  But still I shou'd have no one over my head  Jack  That's a mistake I'm stronger than thou and Standish the exciseman is a better scholar so we should not remain equal a minute I shou'd out  fight  thee and he'd out  wit  thee And if such a sturdy fellow as I am was to come and break down thy hedge for a little firing or to take away the crop from thy ground I'm not so sure that these newfangled laws wou'd see thee righted I tell thee Tom we have a fine constitution already and our forefathers thought so  Tom  They were a pack of fools and had never read the Rights of Man  Jack  I'll tell thee a story When sir John married my Lady who is a little fantastical and likes to do every thing like the French begged him to pull down yonder sine old castle and build it up in her frippery way No says Sir John what shall I pull down this noble building raised by the wisdom of my brave ancestors which outstood the civil wars and only underwent a little needful repair at the Revolution  and which all my neighbours come to take a pattern byshall I pull it all down I say only because there may be a dark closet or an inconvenient room or two in it My lady mumpt and grumbled but the castle was let stand and a glorious building it is though there may be a trifling fault or two and tho' a few decays may want stopping so now and then they mend a little thing and they'll go on mending I dare say as they have leisure to the end of the chapter if they are let alone But no pullmedown works What is it you are crying out for Tom  Tom  Why for a perfect government  Jack  You might as well cry for the moon There's nothing perfect in this world take my word for it  Tom  I don't see why we are to work like slaves while others roll about in their coaches feed on the fat of the land and do nothing  Jack  My little maid brought home a storybook from the CharitySchool t'other day in which was a bit of a fable about the Belly and the Limbs The hands said I won't work any longer to feed this lazy belly who sits in state like a lord and does nothing Said the feet I won't walk and tire myself to carry him about let him shift for himself so said all the members just as your levellers and republicans do now And what was the consequence Why the belly was pinched to be sure but the hands and the feet and the rest of the members suffered so much for want of their old nourishment that they fell sick pined away and would have died if they had not come to their senses just in time to save their lives as I hope all you will do  Tom  But the timesbut the taxes Jack  Jack  Things are dear to be sure but riot and  murder is not the way to make them cheap And taxes are high but I'm told there's a deal of old scores paying off and by them who did not contract the debt neither Tom Besides things are mending I hope and what little is done is for us poor people our candles are somewhat cheaper and I dare say if the honest gentleman is not disturbed by you levellers things will mend every day But bear one thing in mind the more we riot the more we shall have to pay Mind another thing too that in France the poor paid all the taxes as I have heard 'em say and the quality paid nothing  Tom  Well I know what's what as well as another and I'm as fit to govern  Jack  No Tom no You are indeed as good as another man seeing you have hands to work and a soul to be saved But are all men fit for all kinds of things Solomon says "How can he be wise whose talk is of oxen" Every one in his way I am a better judge of a horseshoe than Sir John but he has a deal better notion of state affairs than I and I can no more do without him than he can do without me And few are so poor but they may get a vote for a parliamentman and so you see the poor have as much share in the government as they well know how to manage  Tom  But I say all men are equal Why should one be above another  Jack  If that's thy talk Tom thou dost quarrel with Providence and not with government For the woman is below her husband and the children are below their mother and the servant is below his master  Tom  But the subject is not below the king all kings are "crowned ruffians" and all governments are wicked For my part I'm resolved I'll pay no more taxes to any of them  Jack  Tom Tom this is thy nonsense if thou didst go oftner to church thou wouldst know where it is said "Render unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's" and also "Fear God honour the king" Your book tells you that we need obey no government but that of the people and that we may fashion and alter the government according to our whimsies but mine tells me "Let every one be subject to the higher powers for all power is of God the powers that be are ordained of God whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God" Thou sayest thou will pay no taxes to any of them Dost thou know who it was that work'd a miracle that he might have money to pay tribute with rather than set you and me an example of disobedience to government  Tom  I say we shall never be happy till we do as the French have done  Jack  The French and we contending for liberty Tom is just as if thou and I were to pretend to run a race thou to set out from the starting post when I am in already why we've got it man we've no race to run We're there already Our constitution is no more like what the French one was than a mug of our Taunton beer is like a platter of their soupmaigre  Tom  I know we shall be undone if we don't get a new  constitution  that's all  Jack  And I know we shall be undone if we do I don't know much about politics but I can see by a little what a great deal means Now only to shew thee the state of public credit as I think Tim Standish calls it There's Farmer Furrow a few years ago he had an odd l by him so to keep it out of harm's way he put it out to use on government security I think he calls it Well  t'other day he married one of his daughters so he thought he'd give her that l for a bit of a portion Tom as I'm a living man when he went to take it out if his fifty pounds was not grown almost to an hundred and would have been a full hundred they say by this time if the gentleman had been let alone  Tom  Well still as the old saying isI should like to do as they do in France  Jack  What should'st like to be murdered with as little ceremony as Hackabout the butcher knocks down a calf Then for every little bit of tiff a man gets rid of his wife And as to liberty of  conscience  which they brag so much about why they have driven away their parsons aye and murdered many of 'em because they would not swear as they would have them And then they talk of liberty of the press why Tom only t'other day they hanged a man for printing a book against this pretty government of theirs  Tom  But you said yourself it was sad times in France before they pull'd down the old government  Jack  Well and suppose the French were as much in the right as I know them to be in the wrong what does that argue for  us  Because neighbour Furrow t'other day pulled down a crazy old barn is that a reason why I must set fire to my tight cottage  Tom  I don't see why one man is to ride in his coach and six while another mends the highway for him  Jack  I don't see why the man in the coach is to  drive over  the man on foot or hurt a hair of his head And as to our great folks that you levellers have such a spite against I don't pretend to say they are a bit better than they should be but  that's no affair of mine let them look to that they'll answer for that in another place To be sure I wish they'd set us a better example about going to church and those things but still  hoarding's  not the sin of the age they don't lock up their  money  away it goes and every body's the better for it They do spend too much to be sure in feastings and fandangoes and if I was a parson I'd go to work with 'em in another kind of a way but as I am only a poor tradesman why 'tis but bringing more grist to my mill It all comes among the peopleTheir coaches and their furniture and their buildings and their planting employ a power of tradespeople and labourersNow in this village what should we do without the castle Though my Lady is too rantipolish and flies about all summer to hot water and cold water and fresh water and salt water when she ought to stay at home with Sir John yet when she does come down she brings such a deal of gentry that I have more horses than I can shoe and my wife more linen than she can wash Then all our grown children are servants in the family and rare wages they have got Our little boys get something every day by weeding their gardens and the girls learn to sew and knit at Sir John's expence who sends them all to school on a Sunday  Tom  Aye but there's not Sir John's in every village  Jack  The more's the pity But there's other help 'Twas but last year you broke your leg and was nine weeks in the Bristol Infirmary where you was taken as much care of as a lord and your family was maintained all the while by the parish No poorrates in France Tom and here there's a matter of two million and a halt  paid for them if t'was but a little better managed  Tom  Two million and a half  Jack  Aye indeed Not translated into tenpences as your French millions are but twenty good shillings to the pound But when this levelling comes about there will be no Infirmaries no hospitals no charityschools no sundayschools where so many hundred thousand poor souls learn to read the word of God for nothing For who is to pay for them  equality  can't afford it and those that may be willing won't be able  Tom  But we shall be one as good as another for all that  Jack  Aye and bad will be the best But we must work as we do now and with this difference that no one will be able to pay us Tom I have got the use of my limbs of my liberty of the laws and of my bible The two first I take to be my  natural  rights the two last my  civil  and  religious  these I take it are the  true Rights of Man  and all the rest is nothing but nonsense and madness and wickedness My cottage is my castle I sit down in it at night in peace and thankfulness and  no man maketh me afraid  Instead of indulging discontent because another is richer than I in this world for envy is at the bottom of your equality works I read my bible go to church and think of a treasure in heaven  Tom  Aye but the French have got it in this world  Jack  'Tis all a lie Tom Sir John's butler says his master gets letters which say 'tis all a lie 'Tis all murder and nakedness and hunger many of the poor soldiers fight without victuals and march without clothes These are your  Democrats  Tom  Tom  What then dost think all the men on our sidewicked  Jack  Nonot so neitherthey've made fools of the most of you as I believe I judge no man Tom I hate no man Even republicans and levellers I hope will always enjoy the protection of our laws though I hope they will never be our lawmakers There's many true dissenters and there's hollow churchmen and a good man is a good man whether his church has got a steeple to it or not The new fashioned way of proving one's religion is to hate somebody Now though some folks pretend that a man's hating a Papist or a Presbyterian proves him to be a good  Churchman  it don't prove him to be a good  Christian  Tom As much as I hate republican works I'd scorn to  live  in a country where there's not liberty of conscience and where every man might not worship God his own way Now that they had not in France the Bible was shut up in an unknown heathenish tongue While here thou and I can make as free use of our's as a bishop can no more be sent to prison unjustly than a judge and are as much taken care of by the laws as the parliament man who makes them And this levelling makes people so dismal These poor French fellows used to be the merriest dogs in the world but since equality came in I don't believe a Frenchman has ever laughed  Tom  What then dost thou take French  liberty  to be  Jack  To murder more men in one night than ever there poor king did in his whole life  Tom  And what dost thou take a  Democrat  to be  Jack  One who likes to be governed by a thousand tyrants and yet can't bear a king  Tom  What is  Equality  Jack  For every man to pull down every one that is above him till they're all as low as the lowest  Tom  What is  the new Rights of Man  Jack  Battle murder and sudden death  Tom  What is it to be an  enlightened people  Jack  To put out the light of the gospel confound right and wrong and grope about in pitch darkness  Tom  What is  Philosophy  that Tim Standish talks so much about  Jack  To believe that there's neither God nor devil nor heaven nor hellTo dig up a wicked old fellow's  Voltaire  rotton bones whose books Sir John says have been the ruin of thousands and to set his figure up in a church and worship him  Tom  And what mean the other hard words that Tim talks about  organization  and  function  and  civism  and  incivism  and  equalization  and  inviolability  and  imperscriptible  Jack  Nonsense gibberish downright hocuspocus I know 'tis not English Sir John says 'tis not Latin and his valet de sham says 'tis not French neither  Tom  And yet Tim says he shall never be happy till all these fine things are brought over to England  Jack  What into this Christian country Tom Why dost know they have no  sabbath  Their mob parliament meets of a Sunday to do their wicked work as naturally as we do go to church They have renounced God's word and God's day and they don't even date in the year of our Lord Why dost turn pale man And the rogues are always making such a noise Tom in the midst of their parliamenthouse that their speaker rings a bell like our pennypostman because he can't keep them in order  Tom  And dost thou think our Rights of Man will lead to all this wickedness  Jack  As sure as eggs are eggs  Tom  I begin to think we're better off as we are  Jack  I'm sure on't This is only a scheme to make us go back in every thing 'Tis making ourselves poor when we are getting rich  Tom  I begin to think I'm not so very unhappy as I had got to fancy  Jack  Tom I don't care for drink myself but thou dost and I'll argue with thee in thy own way when there's all equality there will be no  superfluity  when there's no wages there'll be no drink and levelling will rob thee of thy ale more than the malttax does  Tom  But Standish says if we had a good government there'd be no want of any thing  Jack  He is like many others who take the king's money and betray him Tho' I'm no scholar I know that a good government is a good thing But don't go to make me believe that  any  government can make a bad man good or a discontented man happyWhat art musing upon man  Tom  Let me sum up the evidence as they say at 'sizesHem To cut every man's throat who does not think as I do or hang him up at a lamppostPretend liberty of conscience and then banish the parsons only for being conscientiousCry out liberty of the press and hang up the first man who writes his mindLose our poor lawsLose one's wife perhaps upon every little tiffMarch without clothes and fight without victualsNo tradeNo bibleNo sabbath nor day of restNo safety no comfort no peace in this worldand no world to comeJack I never knew thee tell a lie in my life  Jack  Nor wou'd I now not even against the French  Tom  And thou art very sure we are not ruined  Jack  I'll tell thee how we are ruined We have a king so loving that he woud'd not hurt the people if he cou'd and so kept in that he cou'd not hurt the people if he wou'd We have as much liberty as can make us happy and more trade and riches than allows us to be good We have the best laws in the world if they were more strictly enforced and the best religion in the world if it was but better followed While Old England is safe I'll glory in her and pray for her and when she is in danger I'll fight for her and die for her  Tom  And so will I too Jack that's what I will  sings  "O the roast beef of old England"  Jack  Thou art an honest fellow Tom  Tom  This is Rose and Crown night and Tim Standish is now at his mischief but we'll go and put an end to that fellow's work  Jack  Come along  Tom  No first I'll stay to burn my book and then I'll go and make a bonfirè and  Jack  Hold Tom There is but one thing worse than a bitter enemy and that is an imprudent friend If thou woud'st shew thy love to thy King and country let's have no drinking no riot no bonfires but put in practice this text which our parson preached on last Sunday "Study to be quiet work with your own hands and mind your own business"  Tom  And so I will JackCome on  THE END
