 Algernon Sidney  Manus haec Inimica Tyrannis Ense petit placidam sub Libertate Quietem  DISCOURSES CONCERNING GOVERNMENT BY Algernon Sidney Son to  Robert  Earl of  Leicester  and Ambassador from the Commonwealth of  England  to  Charles Gustavus  King of  Sweden  Publish'd from an Original Manuscript The Second Edition carefully corrected To which is Added The Paper He deliver'd to the Sheriffs immediately before his Death And an ALPHABETICAL TABLE  Dulce decorum est pro Patria mori  Hor  LONDON  Printed by  J Darby  in  BartholomewClose  MDCCIV  THE PREFACE  HOW highly the Writings of wise and good Men concerning Government have bin esteem'd in all Ages the testimony of History and the preservation of so many Books compos'd by the Antients on that Subject do sufficiently manifest And it may be truly said that unless men have utterly abandon'd themselves to all that is detestable they have seldom attempted to detract from the worth of the Assertors of Liberty tho Ambition and other passions have influenc'd them to act in opposition to it When  Augustus  had surpriz'd a young  Roman  who was related to him reading a political Discourse of  Cicero  he commended his judgment in that choice The History of  France  written by the President  de Thou  with a spirit of Freedom that might have bin worthy of those who liv'd before the violation of their Liberty has bin so generally valu'd by men of all ranks in that Nation that 'tis hard to find a Book on any important Subject which has had so many Editions And the just esteem that the Emperor  Charles  the Fifth made of the Memoirs of  Philip de Commines  tho that Author has given so many instances of his detestation of Tyranny may be enough to put this matter out of dispute But if all other proof were wanting the implacable hatred and unweary'd industry of the worst of men to suppress such Writings would abundantly testify their excellency  That Nations should be well inform'd of their Rights is of the most absolute necessity because the happiness or infelicity of any People intirely depends upon the enjoyment or deprivation of Liberty which is so invincibly prov'd in the following Discourses that to endeavour to make i  more clear would be an unpardonable presumption  If any man think the publication of this Work to be unseasonable a  this time he is desir'd to consider that as men expect good Laws only from a good Government so the Reign of a Prince whose Title is founded upon the principle of Liberty which is here defended cannot but be the most proper if not the only time to inform the People of the  just  that from a due sense of their inestimable value they may  encourag'd to assert them against the attempts of ill men in time to  ome  'Tis not necessary here to say anything concerning the Person of the Author He was so well known in the world so universally esteem'd by those who knew how to set a just value upon true Merit and will appear so admirable in the following Discourses as not to stand in need of a flattering Panegyrick But it may not be amiss to say something of the Discourses now publish'd  The Paper deliver'd to the Sheriffs immediately before his death informs us that he had left a Large and a Lesser Treatise written against the Principles contain'd in  Filmer  's Book and that a small part of the lesser Treatise had bin produc'd for evidence against him at his Trial 'Tis there also said that the lesser Treatise neither was nor probably ever should have bin finish'd This therefore is the Large Work mention'd in that Paper and not the Lesser upon part of which the wicked Sentence pronounc'd and executed against him was grounded  It remains only to add a few words for satisfaction of the Publick that these Discourses are genuine And here I shall not need to say that they were put into the hands of a Person of eminent Quality and Integrity by the Author himself and that the Original is in the judgment of those who knew him best all written by his own hand His inimitable manner of treating this noble Subject is instead of a thousand demonstrations that the Work can belong to no other than the Great Man whose Name it bears

Israelites  the glory of a free Monarchy but the evils the People should suffer that he might divert them from desiring a King  p  Sect  No People can be oblig'd to suffer from their Kings what they have not a right to do  p  Sect  The mischiefs suffer'd from wicked Kings are such as render it both reasonable and just for all Nations that have Vertue and Power to exert both in repelling them  p

from the change of manners and corruption of the times  p  Sect  The power of calling and dissolving Parliaments is not simply in the King The variety of Customs in chusing Parliamentmen and the

Publick  p  Sect  Good Laws prescribe easy and safe Remedys against the Evils proceeding from the Vices or Infirmitys of the Magistrate and when they fail they must be supply'd  p  Sect  The People

HAVING lately seen a Book intitul'd  Patriarcha  written by Sir  Robert Filmer  concerning the Universal and undistinguish'd Right of all Kings I thought a time of leisure might be well employ'd in examining his Doctrin and the Questions arising from it which seem so far to concern all Mankind that besides the Influence upon our future Life they may be said to comprehend all that in this World deserves to be car'd for If he say true there is but one Government in the World that can have any thing of Justice in it and those who have hitherto bin esteem'd the best and wisest of Men for having constituted Commonwealths or Kingdoms and taken much pains so to proportion the Powers of several Magistracys that they might all concur in procuring the Publick Good or so to divide the Powers between the Magistrats and People that a wellregulated Harmony might be preserv'd in the whole were the most unjust and foolish of all Men They were not builders but overthrowers of Governments their business was to set up Aristocratical Democratical or mix'd Governments in opposition to that Monarchy which by the immutable Laws of God and Nature is impos'd upon Mankind or presumptuously to put Shackles upon the Monarch who by the same Laws is to be absolute and uncontrol'd They were rebellious and disobedient Sons who rose up against their Father and not only refus'd to hearken to his Voice but made him bend to their Will In their Opinion such only deserv'd to be call'd Good Men who endeavour'd to be good to Mankind or to that Country to which they were more particularly related and in as much as that Good consists in a Felicity of Estate and Perfection of Person they highly valued such as had endeavour'd to make Men better wiser and happier This they understood to be the end for which Men enter'd into Societys And tho  Cicero  says that Commonwealths were instituted for the obtaining of Justice he contradicts them not but comprehends all in that  word because 'tis just that whosoever receives a Power should employ it wholly for the accomplishment of the Ends for which it was given This Work could be perform'd only by such as excell'd in Virtue but lest they should deflect from it no Government was thought to be well constituted  Potentiora Legum quam hominum Imperia  Tacit  unless the Laws prevail'd above the Commands of Men and they were accounted as the worst of Beasts who did not prefer such a Condition before a Subjection to the fluctuating and irregular Will of a Man  If we believe Sir  Robert  all this is mistaken Nothing of this kind was ever left to the Choice of Men They are not to inquire what conduces to their own good God and Nature have put us into a way from which we are not to swerve We are not to live to him nor to our selves but to the Master that he hath set over us One Government is establish'd over all and no Limits can be set to the Power of the Person that manages it This is the Prerogative or as another Author of the same Stamp calls it the  Royal Charter  granted to Kings by God They all have an equal right to it Women and Children are Patriarchs and the next in Blood without any regard to Age Sex or other Qualitys of the Mind or Body are Fathers of as many Nations as fall under their Power We are not to examin whether he or she be young or old virtuous or vicious sober minded or stark mad the Right and Power is the same in all Whether Virtue be exalted or supprest whether he that bears the Sword be a Praise to those that do well and a Terror to those that do evil or a Praise to those that do evil and a Terror to such as do well it concerns us not for the King must not lose his Right nor have his Power diminish'd on any account I have bin sometimes apt to wonder how things of this nature could enter into the head of any Man Or if no Wickedness or Folly be so great but some may fall into it I could not well conceive why they should publish it to the World But these thoughts ceas'd when I consider'd that a People from all Ages in love with Liberty and desirous to maintain their own Privileges could never be brought to resign 'em unless they were made to believe that in Conscience they ought to do it which could not be unless they were also persuaded to believe that there was a Law set to all Mankind which none might transgress and which put the Examination of all those Matters out of their power This is our Author's Work By this it will appear whose Throne he seeks to advance and whose Servant he is whilst he pretends to serve the King And that it may be evident he has made use of Means sutable to the Ends propos'd for the Service of his great Master I hope to shew that he has not us'd one Argument that is not false nor cited one Author whom he has not perverted and abus'd Whilst my work is so to lay open these Snares that the most simple may not be taken in them I shall not examin how Sir  Robert  came to think himself a Man fit to undertake so great a Work as to destroy the Principles which from the beginning seem to have bin common to all Mankind but only weighing the Positions and Arguments that he alledges will if there be either truth or strength in them confess the Discovery comes from him that gave us least reason to expect it and that in  p  e of the Antients there is not in the World a Piece of Wood out of which a  Mercury  may not be made  SECT II The common Notions of Liberty are not from SchoolDivines but from Nature  IN the first Lines of his Book he seems to denounce War against Mankind endeavouring to overthrow the Principle of Liberty in which God created us and which includes the chief Advantages of the Life we enjoy as well as the greatest helps towards the Felicity that is the end of our hopes in the other To this end he absurdly imputes to the SchoolDivines that which was taken up by 'em as a common Notion written in the Hearts of all Men denied by none but such as are degenerated into Beasts from whence they might prove such Points as of themselves were less evident Thus did  Euclid  lay down certain Axioms which none could deny that did not renounce common Sense from whence he drew the Proofs of such Propositions as were less obvious to the Understanding and they may with as much reason be accus'd of Paganism who say that the Whole is greater than a Part that two Halfs make the Whole or that a streight Line is the shortest way from Point to Point as to say that they who in Politicks lay such Foundations as have bin taken up by Schoolmen and others as undeniable Truths do therefore follow them or have any regard to their Authority Tho the Schoolmen were corrupt they were neither stupid nor unlearned They could not but see that which all Men saw nor lay more approv'd Foundations than That Man is naturally free That he cannot justly be depriv'd of that Liberty without cause and that he dos not resign it or any part of it unless it be in consideration of a greater good which he proposes to himself But if he unjustly imputes the Invention of this to SchoolDivines he in some measure repairs his Fault in saying  This has bin foster'd by all succeeding Papists for good Divinity The Divines of the reformed Churches have entertain'd it and the Common People every where tenderly embrace it  That is to say all Christian Divines whether reform'd or unreform'd do approve it and the People every where magnify it as the height of human Felicity But  Filmer  and such as are like to him being neither reform'd nor unreform'd Christians nor of the People can have no Title to Christianity and in as much as they set themselves against that which is the height of human Felicity they declare themselves Enemys to all that are concern'd in it that is to all Mankind  But says he  They do not remember that the desire of Liberty was the first cause of the Fall of Man  and I desire it may not be forgotten that the Liberty asserted is not a Licentiousness of doing what is pleasing to every one against the Command of God but an Exemption from all human Laws to which they have not given their assent If he would make us believe there was any thing of this in  Adam  's Sin he ought to have prov'd that the Law which he transgrest was impos'd upon him by Man and consequently that there was a Man to impose it for it will easily appear that neither the reform'd or unreform'd Divines nor the People following them do place the Felicity of Man in an exemption from the Laws of God but in a most perfect conformity to them Our Saviour taught us  not to fear such as could kill the Body but him that could kill and cast into  Hell  And the Apostle tells us that  we should obey God rather than Man  It has bin ever hereupon observ'd that they who most precisely adhere to the Laws of God are least sollicitous concerning the Commands of Men unless they are well grounded and those who most delight in the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God do not only subject themselves to him but are most regular Observers of the just Ordinances of Man made by the consent of such as are concern'd according to the Will of God  The Error of not observing this may perhaps deserve to be pardon'd in a Man that had read no Books as proceeding from Ignorance if such as are grosly ignorant can be excus'd when they take upon them to write of such Matters as require the highest knowledg But in Sir  Robert  'tis prevarication and fraud to impute to Schoolmen and Puritans that which in his first Page he acknowledg'd to be the Doctrin of all Reform'd and Unreform'd Christian Churches and that he knows to have bin the Principle in which the  Grecians Italians Spaniards Gauls Germans  and  Britans  and all other generous Nations ever liv'd before the Name of Christ was known in the World insomuch that the base effeminate  Asiaticks  and  Africans  for being careless of their Liberty or unable to govern themselves were by  Aristotle  and other wise Men call'd  Slaves by Nature  and look'd upon as little different from Beasts  This which hath its Root in common Sense not being to be overthrown by Reason he spares his pains of seeking any but thinks it enough to render his Doctrin plausible to his own Party by joining the Jesuits to  Geneva  and coupling  Buchanan  to  Doleman  as both maintaining the same Doctrin tho he might as well have join'd the  Puritans  with the  Turks  because they all think that one and one makes two But whoever marks the Proceedings of  Filmer  and his Masters as well as his Disciples will rather believe that they have learn'd from  Rome  and the Jesuits to hate  Geneva  than that  Geneva  and  Rome  can agree in any thing farther than as they are oblig'd to submit to the Evidence of Truth or that  Geneva  and  Rome  can concur in any Design or Interest that is not common to Mankind  These Men allow'd to the People a liberty of deposing their Princes This is a desperate Opinion  Bellarmin  and  Calvin  look asquint at it  But why is this a desperate Opinion If Disagreements happen between King and People why is it a more desperate Opinion to think the King should be subject to the Censures of the People than the People subject to the Will of the King Did the People make the King or the King make the People Is the King for the People or the People for the King Did God create the  Hebrews  that  Saul  might reign over them or did they from an opinion of procuring their own Good ask a King that might judg them and fight their Battels If God's interposition which shall be hereafter explain'd dos alter the Case did the  Romans  make  Romulus Numa Tullus Hostilius  and  Tarquinius Priscus  Kings or did they make or beget the  Romans  If they were made Kings by the  Romans  'tis certain they that made them sought their own good in so doing and if they were made by and for the City and People I desire to know if it was not better that when their Successors departed from the End of their Institution by endeavouring to destroy it or all that was good in it they should be censur'd and ejected than be permitted to ruin that People for whose good they were created Was it more just that  Caligula  or  Nero  should be suffer'd to destroy the poor Remains of the  Roman  Nobility and People with the Nations subject to that Empire than that the Race of such Monsters  should be extinguish'd and a great part of Mankind especially the best against whom they were most fierce preserv'd by their Death  I presume our Author thought these Questions might be easily decided and that no more was requir'd to shew the foremention'd Assertions were not at all desperate than to examin the Grounds of them but he seeks to divert us from this enquiry by proposing the dreadful Consequences of subjecting Kings to the Censures of their People whereas no Consequence can destroy any Truth and the worst of this is That if it were receiv'd some Princes might be restrain'd from doing Evil or punish'd if they will not be restrain'd We are therefore only to consider whether the People Senat or any Magistracy made by and for the People have or can have such a Right for if they have whatsoever the Consequences may be it must stand And as the one tends to the Good of Mankind in restraining the Lusts of wicked Kings the other exposes'em without Remedy to the Fury of the most savage of all Beasts I am not asham'd in this to concur with  Buchanan Calvin  or  Bellarmin  and without Envy leave to  Filmer  and his Associats the Glory of maintaining the contrary  But notwithstanding our Author's aversion to Truth he confesses  That  Hayward Blackwood Barclay  and others who have bravely vindicated the Right of Kings in this Point do with one consent admit as an unquestionable Truth and assent unto the natural Liberty and Equality of Mankind not so much as once questioning or opposing it  And indeed I believe that tho since the Sin of our first Parents the Earth has brought forth Briars and Brambles and the Nature of Man has bin fruitful only in Vice and Wickedness neither the Authors he mentions nor any others have had impudence enough to deny such evident Truth as seems to be planted in the Hearts of all Men or to publish Doctrins so contrary to common Sense Virtue and Humanity till these Times The production of  Laud Manwaring Sibthorp Hobbs Filmer  and  Heylin  seems to have bin reserv'd as an additional Curse to compleat the Shame and Misery of our Age and Country Those who had Wit and Learning with something of Ingenuity and Modesty tho they believ'd that Nations might possibly make an ill use of their Power and were very desirous to maintain the Cause of Kings as far as they could put any good colour upon it yet never denied that some had suffer'd justly which could not be is there were no Power of judging them nor ever asserted any thing that might arm them with an irresistible Power of doing mischief animate them to persist in the most flagitious Courses with assurance of perpetual Impunity or engage Nations in an inevitable necessity of suffering all manner of Outrages They knew that the Actions of those Princes who were not altogether detestable might be defended by particular Reasons drawn from them or the Laws of their Country and would neither undertake the defence of such as were abominable nor bring Princes to whom they wish'd well into the odious extremity of justifying themselves by Arguments that favour'd  Caligula  and  Nero  as well as themselves and that must be taken for a Confession that they were as bad as could be imagin'd since nothing could be said for them that might not as well be applied to the worst that had bin or could be But  Filmer Heylin  and their Associats scorning to be restrain'd by such considerations boldly lay the Ax to the Root of the Tree and rightly enough affirm  That the whole Fabrick of that which they call Popular Sedition would fall to the ground if the Principle of natural Liberty were remov'd  And on the other hand it must be acknowledg'd that the whole Fabrick of Tyranny will  be much weaken'd if we prove That Nations have a right to make their own Laws constitute their own Magistrats and that such as are so constituted owe an account of their Actions to those by whom and for whom they are appointed  SECT III Implicit Faith belongs to Fools and Truth is comprehended by examining Principles  WHILST  Filmer  's business is to overthrow Liberty and Truth he in his Passage modestly professes  not to meddle with Mysterys of State  or  Arcana Imperii  He renounces those Inquirys thro an  implicit Faith  which never enter'd into the head of any but Fools and such as thro a carelesness of the Point in question acted as if they were so This is the Foundation of the Papal Power and it can stand no longer than those that compose the  Roman  Church can be persuaded to submit their Consciences to the Word of the Priests and esteem themselves discharg'd from the necessity of searching the Scriptures in order to know whether the things that are told them are true of false This may shew whether our Author or those of  Geneva  do best agree with the  Roman  Doctrin But his Instance is yet more sottish than his Profession  An Implicit Faith  says he  is given to the meanest Artificer  I wonder by whom Who will wear a Shoo that hurts him because the Shoomaker tells him 'tis well made or who will live in a House that yields no defence against the extremitys of Weather because the Mason or Carpenter assures him 'tis a very good House Such as have Reason Understanding or common Sense will and ought to make use of it in those things that concern themselves and their Posterity and suspect the Words of such as are interested in deceiving or persuading them not to see with their own Eyes that they may be more easily deceiv'd This Rule obliges us so far to search into Matters of State as to examin the Original Principles of Government in general and of our own in particular We cannot distinguish Truth from Falshood Right from Wrong or know what Obedience we owe to the Magistrat or what we may justly expect from him unless we know what he is why he is and by whom he is made to be what he is These perhaps may be call'd  Mysterys of State  and some would persuade us they are to be esteem'd  Arcana  but whosoever confesses himself to be ignorant of 'em must acknowledg he is uncapable of giving any judgment upon things relating to the Superstructure and in so doing evidently shews to others that they ought not at all to hearken to what he says  His Argument to prove this is more admirable  If an Implicit Faith  says he  is given to the meanest Artificer in his Craft much more to a Prince in the profound Secrets of Government  But where is the Consequence If I trust to the judgment of an Artificer or one of a more ingenuous Profession 'tis not because he is of it but because I am persuaded he dos well understand it and that he will be saithful to me in things relating to his Art I do not send for  Lower  or  Micklethwait  when I am sick nor ask the Advice of  Maynard  or  Jones  in a Suit of Law because the first are Physicians and the other Lawyers but because I think them wise learned  diligent and faithful there being a multitude of others who go under the same name whose Opinion I would never ask Therefore if any Conclusion can be drawn from thence in favour of Princes it must be of such as have all the Qualitys of Ability and Integrity that should create this confidence in me or it must be prov'd that all Princes in as much as they are Princes have such Qualitys No general Conclusion can be drawn from the first Case because it must depend upon the Circumstances which ought to be particularly prov'd And if the other be asserted I desire to know whether  Caligula Claudius Nero Vitellius Domitian Commodus Heliogabalus  and others not unlike to them had those admirable Endowments upon which an Implicit Faith ought to have bin grounded how they came by them and whether we have any Promise from God that all Princes should for ever excel in those Vertues or whether by experience we find that they do so If they are or have bin wanting in any the whole falls to the ground for no Man enjoys as a Prince that which is not common to all Princes And if every Prince has not Wisdom to understand these profound Secrets Integrity to direct him according to what he knows to be good and a sufficient measure of Industry and Valour to protect me he is not the Artificer to whom the Implicit Faith is due His Eyes are as subject to dazle as my own But 'tis a shame to insist on such a Point as this We see Princes of all sorts they are born as other Men The vilest Flatterer dares not deny that they are wise or foolish good or bad valiant or cowardly like other Men and the Crown dos neither bestow extraordinary Qualitys ripen such as are found in Princes sooner than in the meanest nor preserve them from the decays of Age Sickness or other Accidents to which all Men are subject And if the greatest King in the World falls into them he is as uncapable of that mysterious Knowledg and his Judgment is as little to be relied on as that of the poorest Peasant  This Matter is not mended by sending us to seek those Vertues in the Ministers which are wanting in the Prince The ill effects of  Rehoboam  's Folly could not be corrected by the Wisdom of  Solomon  's Counsellors He rejected them and such as are like to him will always do the same thing  Nero  advis'd with none but Musicians Players Chariotdrivers or the abominable Ministers of his Pleasures and Crueltys  Arcadius  his Senat was chiefly compos'd of Buffoons and Cooks influenc'd by an old rascally Eunuch And 'tis an eternal Truth that a weak or wicked Prince can never chuse a wise Council nor receive any benefit by one that is impos'd upon him unless they have a Power of acting without him which would render the Government in effect Aristocratical and would probably displease our Author as much as if it were so in name also Good and wise Counsellors do not grow up like Mushrooms great Judgment is requir'd in chusing and preparing them If a weak or vicious Prince should be so happy to find them chosen to his hand they would avail him nothing There will ever be variety of Opinions amongst 'em and he that is of a perverted Judgment will always chuse the worse of those that are propos'd and favour the worst Men as most like to himself Therefore if this Implicit Faith be grounded upon a supposition of profound Wisdom in the Prince the Foundation is overthrown and cannot stand for to repose confidence in the Judgment and Integrity of one that has none is the most brutish of all Follys So that if a Prince may have or want the Qualitys upon which my Faith in him can be rationally grounded I cannot yield the Obedience he requires unless  I search into the Secrets relating to his Person and Commands which he forbids I cannot know how to obey unless I know in what and to whom Nor in what unless I know what ought to be commanded Nor what ought to be commanded unless I understand the Original Right of the Commander which is the great  Arcanum  Our Author finding himself involv'd in many Difficultys proposes an Expedient as ridiculous as any thing that had gone before being nothing more than an absurd begging the main question and determining it without any shadow of proof He enjoins an active or passive Obedience before he shews what should oblige or persuade us to it This indeed were a compendious way of obviating that which he calls  Popular Sedition  and of exposing all Nations that fall under the Power of Tyrants to be destroy'd utterly by them  Nero  or  Domitian  would have desir'd no more than that those who would not execute their wicked Commands should patiently have suffer'd their Throats to be cut by such as were less scrupulous And the World that had suffer'd those Monsters for some years must have continu'd under their Fury till all that was good and virtuous had bin abolish'd But in those Ages and Parts of the World where there has bin any thing of Vertue and Goodness we may observe a third sort of Men who would neither do Villanys nor suffer more than the Laws did permit or the consideration of the publick Peace did require Whilst Tyrants with their Slaves and the Instruments of their Crueltys were accounted the Dregs of Mankind and made the objects of detestation and scorn these Men who deliver'd their Countrys from such Plagues were thought to have something of Divine in them and have bin famous above all the rest of Mankind to this day Of this sort were  Pelopidas Epaminondas Thrasibulus Harmodius Aristogiton Philopemen Lucius Brutus Publius Valerius Marcus Brutus C Cassius M Cato  with a multitude of others amongst the antient Heathens Such as were Instruments of the like Deliverances amongst the  Hebrews  as  Moses Othniel Ehud Barac Gideon Sampson Jephtha Samuel David Jehu  the  Maccabees  and others have from the Scriptures a certain Testimony of the Righteousness of their Proceedings when they neither would act what was evil nor suffer more than was reasonable But lest we should learn by their Examples and the Praises given to them our Author confines the Subject's choice to acting or suffering that is doing what is commanded or lying down to have his Throat cut or to see his Family and Country made desolate This he calls giving to  Cesar  that which is  Cesar  's whereas he ought to have consider'd that the Question is not whether that which is  Cesar  's should be render'd to him for that is to be done to all Men but who is  Cesar  and what doth of right belong to him which he no way indicates to us so that the Question remains intire as if he had never mention'd it unless we do in a compendious way take his word for the whole  SECT IV The Rights of particular Nations cannot subsist if General Principles contrary to them are receiv'd as true  NOtwithstanding this our Anthor if we will believe him  dos not question or quarrel at the Rights or Libertys of this or any other Nation  He only denies they can have any such in subjecting them necessarily and  universally to the will of one Man and says not a word that is not applicable to every Nation in the World as well as to our own But as the bitterness of his malice seems to be most especially directed against  England  I am inclin'd to believe he hurts other Countrys only by accident as the famous  The Marchioness of  Brinvilliers  French  Lady intended only to poison her Father Husband Brother and some more of her nearest Relations but rather than they should escape destroy'd many other Persons of Quality who at several times din'd with them and if that ought to excuse her I am content he also should pass uncensur'd tho his Crimes are incomparably greater than those for which she was condemn'd or than any can be which are not of a publick extent  SECT V To depend upon the Will of a Man is Slavery  THis as he thinks is farther sweeten'd by asserting that he dos not inquire what the Rights of a People are but from whence not considering that whilst he denies they can proceed from the Laws of natural Liberty or any other Root than the Grace and Bounty of the Prince he declares they can have none at all For as Liberty solely consists in an independency upon the Will of another and by the name of Slave we understand a Man who can neither dispose of his Person nor Goods but enjoys all at the will of his Master there is no such thing in nature as a Slave if those Men or Nations are not Slaves who have no other title to what they enjoy than the grace of the Prince which he may revoke whensoever he pleases But there is more than ordinary Extravagance in his Assertion That  the greatest Liberty in the World is for a People to live under a Monarch  when his whole Book is to prove That this Monarch has his Right from God and Nature is endow'd with an unlimited Power of doing what he pleases and can be restrain'd by no Law If it be Liberty to live under such a Government I desire to know what is Slavery It has bin hitherto believ'd in the World that the  Assyrians Medes Arabs Egyptians Turks  and others like them liv'd in Slavery because their Princes were Masters of their Lives and Goods Whereas the  Grecians Italians Gauls Germans Spaniards  and  Carthaginians  as long as they had any Strength Vertue or Courage amongst 'em were esteem'd free Nations because they abhor'd such a Subjection They were and would be govern'd only by Laws of their own making  Potentiora erant Legum quam hominum Imperia  Even their  Princes had the  C Tacit▪ Ibid  Authority or Credit of Persuading rather than the Power of Commanding  But all this was mistaken These Men were Slaves and the  Asiaticks  were Freemen By the same rule the  Venetians Switzers Grisons  and  Hollanders  are not free Nations but Liberty in its perfection is enjoy'd in  France  and  Turky  The Intention of our Ancestors was without doubt to establish this amongst us by  Magna Charta  and other preceding or subsequent Laws but they ought to have added one clause That the Contents of 'em should be in sorce only so long as it pleas'd the King King  Alfred  upon whose Laws  Magna Charta  was grounded when he said the  English  Nation was as free as the internal thoughts of a Man did only mean that it should be so as long as it pleas'd their Master This it seems  was the end of our Law and we who are born under it and are descended from such as have so valiantly defended their Rights against the Encroachments of Kings have follow'd after vain shadows and without the expence of Sweat Treasure or Blood might have secur'd our beloved Liberty by casting all into the King's hands  We owe the discovery of these Secrets to our Author who after having gravely declar'd 'em thinks no offence ought to be taken at the freedom he assumes of examining things relating to the Liberty of Mankind because he has the Right which is common to all But he ought to have consider'd that in asserting that Right to himself he allows it to all Mankind And as the temporal good of all Men consists in the preservation of it he declares himself to be their mortal Enemy who endeavours to destroy it If he were alive this would deserve to be answer'd with Stones rather than Words He that oppugns the publick Liberty overthrows his own and is guilty of the most brutish of all Follys whilst he arrogates to himself that which he denies to all Men  I cannot but commend his Modesty and Care  not to detract from the Worth of Learned Men  but it seems they were all subject to error except himself who is render'd infallible thro Pride Ignorance and Impudence But if  Hooker  and  Aristotle  were wrong in their Fundamentals concerning natural Liberty how could they be in the right when they built upon it Or if they did mistake how can they deserve to be cited or rather why is such care taken to pervert their Sense It seems our Author is by their Errors brought to the knowledg of the Truth  Men have heard of a Dwarf standing on the Shoulders of a Giant who saw farther than the Giant but now that the Dwarf standing on the Ground sees that which the Giant did overlook  we must learn from him If there be Sense in this the Giant must be blind or have such eyes only as are of no use to him He minded only the things that were far from him These Great and Learned Men mistook the very Principle and Foundation of all their Doctrin If we believe our Author this misfortune befel them because they too much trusted to the Schoolmen He names  Aristotle  and I presume intends to comprehend  Plato Plutarch Thucydides Xenophon Polybius  and all the antient  Grecians Italians  and others who asserted the natural Freedom of Mankind only in imitation of the Schoolmen to advance the Power of the Pope and would have compast their design if  Filmer  and his Associats had not oppos'd 'em These Men had taught us to make the  unnatural Distinction between Royalist and Patriot  and kept us from seeing  That the relation between King and People is so great that their wellbeing is reciprocal  If this be true how came  Tarquin  to think it good for him to continue King at  Rome  when the People would turn him out or the People to think it good for them to turn him out when he desir'd to continue in Why did the  Syracusians  destroy the Tyranny of  Dionysius  which he was not willing to leave till he was pull'd out by the heels How could  Nero  think of burning  Rome  Or why did  Caligula  wish the People had but one Neck that he might strike it off at one blow if their Welsare was thus reciprocal 'Tis not enough to say These were wicked or mad Men for other Princes may be so also and there may be the same reason of differing from them For if the Proposition be not universally true 'tis not to be receiv'd as true in relation to any till it be particularly prov'd and then 'tis not to be imputed to the Quality of Prince but to the personal Vertue of the Man  I do not find any great matters in the passages taken out of  Bellarmin  which our Author says comprehend the strength of all that ever he had heard read or seen produc'd for the natural Liberty of the Subject but he not mentioning where they are to be found I do not think my self oblig'd to examin all his Works to see whether they are rightly cited or not however there is certainly nothing new in them We see the same as to the substance in those who wrote many Ages before him as well as in many that have liv'd since his time who neither minded him nor what he had written I dare not take upon me to give an account of his Works having read few of them but as he seems to have laid the Foundation of his Discourses in such common Notions as were assented to by all Mankind those who follow the same method have no more regard to Jesuitism and Popery tho he was a Jesuit and a Cardinal than they who agree with  Faber  and other Jesuits in the Principles of Geometry which no sober Man did ever deny  SECT VI God leaves to Man the choice of Forms in Government and those who constitute one Form may abrogate it  BUT Sir  Robert desires to make Observations on  Bellarmin  's words before he examins or refutes them  and indeed it were not possible to make such stuff of his Doctrin as he dos if he had examin'd or did understand it First he very wittily concludes  That if by the Law of God the Power be immediatly in the People God is the Author of a Democracy  And why not as well as of a Tyranny Is there any thing in it repugnant to the Being of God Is there more reason to impute to God  Caligula  's Monarchy than the Democracy of  Athens  Or is it more for the Glory of God to assert his Presence with the  Ottoman  or  French  Monarchs than with the popular Governments of the  Switsers  and  Grisons  Is Pride Malice Luxury and Violence so sutable to his Being that they who exercise them are to be reputed his Ministers And is Modesty Humility Equality and Justice so contrary to his Nature that they who live in them should be thought his Enemys Is there any absurdity in saying that since God in Goodness and Mercy to Mankind has with an equal hand given to all the Benefit of Liberty with some measure of understanding how to employ it 'tis lawful for any Nation as occasion shall require to give the Exercise of that Power to one or more Men under certain Limitations or Conditions or to retain it in themselves if they think it good for them If this may be done we are at the end of all Controversys concerning one Form of Government establish'd by God to which all Mankind must submit and we may safely conclude that having given to all Men in some degree a Capacity of judging what is good for themselves he has granted to all likewise a Liberty of inventing such Forms as please them best without favouring one more than another  His second Observation is grounded upon a Falsity in matter of Fact  Bellarmin  dos not say that Democracy is an Ordinance of God more than any other Government nor that the People have no Power to make use of their Right but that they do that is to say ordinarily transmit the Exercise of it to one or more And 'tis certain they do sometimes  especially in small Citys retain it in themselves But whether that were observ'd or not by  Bellarmin  makes nothing to our Cause which we defend and not him  The next Point is subtile and he thinks thereby to have brought  Belarrmin  and such as agree with his Principle to a Nonplus He doubts who shall judg of the lawful cause of changing the Government and says It is  a pestilent Conclusion to place that Power in the Multitude  But why should this be esteem'd pestilent or to whom If the allowance of such a Power to the Senat was pestilent to  Nero  it was beneficial to Mankind and the denial of it which would have given to  Nero  an opportunity of continuing in his Villanys would have bin pestilent to the best of Men whom he endeavour'd to destroy and to all others that receiv'd benefit from them But this Question depends upon another for if Governments are constituted for the Pleasure Greatness or Profit of one Man he must not be interrupted for the opposing of his Will is to overthrow the Institution On the other side if the Good of the Governed be sought care must be taken that the End be accomplish'd tho it be with the prejudice of the Governor If the Power be originally in the Multitude and one or more Men to whom the exercise of it or a part of it was committed had no more than their Brethren till it was confer'd on him or them it cannot be believ'd that rational Creatures would advance one or a few of their Equals above themselves unless in consideration of their own Good and then I find no inconvenience in leaving to them a right of judging  Cujus est instituere ejus est abrogate  whether this be duly perform'd or not We say in general  He that institutes may also abrogate  most especially when the Institution is not only by but for himself If the Multitude therefore do institute the Multitude may abrogate and they themselves or those who succeed in the same Right can only be fit Judges of the performance of the Ends of the Institution Our Author may perhaps say The publick Peace may be hereby disturb'd but he ought to know There can be no Peace where there is no Justice nor any Justice if the Government instituted for the good of a Nation be turn'd to its ruin But in plain English the Inconvenience with which such as he endeavour to afright us is no more than that He or They to whom the Power is given may be restrain'd or chastis'd if they betray their Trust which I presume will displease none but such as would rather subject  Rome  with the best part of the World depending on it to the Will of  Caligula  or  Nero  than  Caligula  or  Nero  to the Judgment of the Senat and People that is rather to expose many great and brave Nations to be destroy'd by the rage of a savage Beast than subject that Beast to the Judgment of all or the choicest Men of them who can have no interest to pervert them or other reason to be severe to him than to prevent the Mischiefs he would commit and to save the People from ruin  In the next place he recites an Argument of  Bellarmin  That  'tis evident in Scripture God has ordain'd Powers but God has given them to no particular Person because by Nature all Men are equal therefore he has given Power to the People or Multitude  I leave him to untie that Knot if he can but as 'tis usual with Impostors he goes about by Surmises to elude the Force of this Argument pretending that in some other place he had contradicted himself and acknowledg'd that every Man was Prince of his Posterity  because that if many Men had bin created together they ought all to have bin Princes of their Posterity  But 'tis not necessary to argue upon Passages  cited from Authors when he that cites 'em may be justly suspected of Fraud and neither indicates the Place nor Treatise lest it should be detected most especially when we are no way concern'd in the Author's Credit I take  Bellarmin  's Argument to be strong and if he in some place did contradict it the hurt is only to himself but in this particular I should not think he did it tho I were sure our Author had faithfully repeated his words for in allowing every Man to be Prince of his Posterity he only says every Man should be chief in his own Family and have a Power over his Children which no man denies But he dos not understand Latin who thinks the word  Princeps  doth in any degree signify an absolute Power or a right of transmitting it to his Heirs and Successors upon which the Doctrin of our Author wholly depends On the contrary The same Law that gave to my Father a Power over me gives me the like over my Children and if I had a thousand Brothers each of them would have the same over their Children  Bellarmin  's Argument therefore being no way enervated by the alledg'd Passage I may justly insist upon it and add That God has not only declar'd in Scripture but written on the Heart of every Man that as it is better to be cloth'd than to go naked to live in a House than to lie in the Fields to be defended by the united Force of a Multitude than to place the hopes of his Security solely in his own strength and to prefer the Benefits of Society before a savage and barbarous Solitude he has also taught them to frame such Societys and to establish such Laws as were necessary to preserve them And we may as reasonably affirm that Mankind is for ever oblig'd to use no other Clothes than leather Breeches like  Adam  to live in hollow Trees and eat Acorns or to seek after the Model of his House for a Habitation and to use no Arms except such as were known to the Patriarchs as to think all Nations for ever oblig'd to be govern'd as they govern'd their Familys This I take to be the genuin sense of the Scripture and the most respectful way of interpreting the Places relating to our purpose 'Tis hard to imagin that God who has left all things to our choice that are not evil in themselves should tie us up in this and utterly incredible that he should impose upon us a necessity of following his Will without declaring it to us Instead of constituting a Government over his People consisting of many Parts which we take to be a Model fit to be imitated by others he might have declar'd in a word That the eldest Man of the eldest Line should be King and that his Will ought to be their Law This had bin more sutable to the Goodness and Mercy of God than to leave us in a dark Labyrinth full of Precipices or rather to make the Government given to his own People a false Light to lead us to destruction This could not be avoided if there were such a thing as our Author calls a  Lord Paramount over his Childrens Children to all Generations  We see nothing in Scripture of Precept or Example that is not utterly abhorrent to this Chimera The only sort of Kings mention'd there with approbation is such a one  as may not raise his Heart above his Brethren  Deut  If God had constituted a Lord Paramount with an absolute Power and multitudes of Nations were to labour and fight for his Greatness and Pleasure this were to raise his Heart to a height that would make him forget he was a Man Such as are vers'd in Scripture not only know that it neither agrees with the Letter or Spirit of that Book but that it is unreasonable in it self unless he were of a Species different from the rest of Mankind His exaltation would not agree with God's Indulgence to his Creatures tho he were the better for it much less when probably he  would be made more unhappy and worse by the Pride Luxury and other Vices that always attend the highest Fortunes 'Tis no less incredible that God who disposes all things in Wisdom and Goodness and appoints a due Place for all should without distinction ordain such a Power to every one succeeding in such a Line as cannot be executed the Wise would refuse and Fools cannot take upon 'em the burden of it without ruin to themselves and such as are under them or expose Mankind to a multitude of other Absurditys and Mischiefs subjecting the Aged to be govern'd by Children the Wise to depend on the Will of Fools the Strong and Valiant to expect defence from the Weak or Cowardly and all in general to receive Justice from him who neither knows nor cares for it  SECT VII  Abraham  and the Patriarchs were not Kings  IF any Man say that we are not to seek into the depth of God's Counsels I answer That if he had for Reasons known only to himself affix'd such a Right to any one Line he would have set a Mark upon those who come of it that Nations might know to whom they owe Subjection or given some testimony of his Presence with  Filmer  and  Heylin  if he had sent them to reveal so great a Mystery Till that be done we may safely look upon them as the worst of Men and teachers only of Lies and Follys This persuades me little to examin what would have bin if God had it once created many Men or the Conclusions that can be drawn from  Adam  's having bin alone For nothing can be more evident than that if many had bin created they had bin all equal unless God had given a Preference to one All their Sons had inherited the same Right after their death and no Dream was ever more empty than his Whimsy of  Adam  's Kingdom or that of the ensuing Patriarchs To say the truth 'tis hard to speak seriously of  Abraham  's Kingdom or to think any Man to be in earnest who mentions it He was a Stranger and a Pilgrim in the Land where he liv'd and pretended to no Authority beyond his own Family which consisted only of a Wife and Slaves He liv'd with  Lot  as with his Equal and would have no Contest with him because they were Brethren His Wife and Servants could neither make up nor be any part of a Kingdom in as much as the despotical Government both in Practice and Principle differs from the Regal If his Kingdom was to be grounded on the Paternal Right it vanish'd away of it self he had no Child  Eliezer  of  Damascus  for want of a better was to be his Heir  Lot  tho his Nephew was excluded He durst not own his own Wife He had not one foot of Land till he bought a Field for a buryingplace His three hundred and eighteen Men were Servants bought according to the custom of those days or their Children and the War he made with them was like to  Gideon  's Enterprize which shews only that God can save by a few as well as by many but makes nothing to our Author's purpose For if they had bin as many in number as the Army of  Semiramis  they could have no relation to the Regal much less to the Paternal Power for a Father dos not buy but beget Children  Notwithstanding this our Author bestows the proud Title of Lord Paramount upon him and transmits it to  Isaac  who was indeed a King like his Father great admirable and glorious in Wisdom and Holiness but utterly void of all worldly splendor or power This spiritual Kingdom was inherited by  Jacob  whose Title to it was not founded on Prerogative of Birth but Election and peculiar Grace but he never enjoy'd any other worldly Inheritance than the Field and Cave which  Abraham  had bought for a buryingplace and the Goods he had gain'd in  Laban  's Service  The Example of  Judah  his Sentence upon  Thamar  is yet farther from the purpose if it be possible for he was then a Member of a privat Family the fourth Son of a Father then living neither in possession nor under the promise of the Privileges of Primogeniture tho  Ruben Simeon  and  Levi  fell from it by their Sins Whatsoever therefore the Right was which belong'd to the Head of the Family it must have bin in  Jacob  but as he profest himself a keeper of Sheep as his Fathers had bin the exercise of that Employment was so far from Regal that it deserves no explication If that Act of  Judah  is to be imputed to a Royal Power I have as much as I ask He tho living with his Father and elder Brothers when he came to be of Age to have Children had the same Power over such as were of or came into his Family as his Father had over him for none can go beyond the Power of Life and Death The same in the utmost extent cannot at the same time equally belong to many If it be divided equally it is no more than that Universal Liberty which God has given to Mankind and every Man is a King till he devests himself of his Right in consideration of something that he thinks better for him  SECT VIII  Nimrod  was the first King during the Life of  Chush Cham Shem  and  Noah  THE Creation is exactly describ'd in the Scripture but we know so little of what past between the finishing of it and the Flood that our Author may say what he pleases and I may leave him to seek his Proofs where he can find them In the mean time I utterly deny that any Power did remain in the Heads of Familys after the Flood that dos in the least degree resemble the Regal in Principle or Practice If in this I am mistaken such Power must have bin in  Noah  and transmitted to one of his Sons The Scripture says only that he built an Altar sacrific'd to the Lord was a Husbandman planted a Vineyard and perform'd such Offices as bear nothing of the Image of a King for the space of three hundred and fifty Years We have reason to believe that his Sons after his Death continu'd in the same manner of Life and the Equality properly belonging to Brethren 'Tis not easy to determin whether  Shem  or  Japhet  were the Elder but  Ham  is declar'd to be the younger  Gen  and  Noah  's Blessing to  Shem  seems to be purely Prophetical and Spiritual of what should be accomplish'd in his Posterity with which  Japhet  should be persuaded to join If it had bin worldly the whole Earth must have bin brought under him and have for ever continu'd in his Race which never was accomplish'd otherwise than in the Spiritual Kingdom of  Christ which relates not to our Author's Lord Paramount  As to earthly Kings the first of 'em was  Nimrod  the sixth Son of  Chush  the Son of  Ham Noah  's younger and accursed Son This Kingdom was set up about a hundred and thirty Years after the Flood whilst  Chush Ham Shem  and  Noah  were yet living whereas if there were any thing of Truth in our Author's Proposition all Mankind must have continu'd under the Government of  Noah  whilst he liv'd and that Power must have bin transmitted to  Shem  who liv'd about three hundred and seventy Years after the erection of  Nimrod  's Kingdom and must have come to  Japhet  if he was the Elder but could never come to  Cham  who is declar'd to have bin certainly the Younger and condemn'd to be a Servant to them both much less to the younger Son of his Son whilst he and those to whom he and his Posterity were to be Subjects were still living  This Rule therefore which the Partizans of Absolute Monarchy fancy to be universal and perpetual falling out in its first beginning directly contrary to what they assert and being never known to have bin recover'd were enough to silence them if they had any thing of modesty or regard to Truth But the matter may be carried farther For the Scripture not only testifys that this Kingdom of  Nimrod  was an Usurpation void of all Right proceeding from the most violent and mischievous Vices but exercis'd with the utmost fury that the most wicked Man of the accursed Race who set himself up against God and all that is good could be capable of The progress of this Kingdom was sutable to its Institution that which was begun in wickedness was carried on with madness and produc'd Confusion The mighty Hunter whom the best Interpreters call a  cruel Tyrant  receding from the simplicity and innocence of the Patriarchs who were Husbandmen or Shepherds arrogating to himself a Dominion over  Shem  to whom he and his Fathers were to be Servants did thereby so peculiarly become the Heir of God's Curse that whatsoever has bin said to this day of the Power that did most directly set it self against God and his People has related literally to the  Babel  that he built or figuratively to that which resembles it in Pride Cruelty Injustice and Madness  But the shameless rage of some of these Writers is such that they rather chuse to ascribe the beginning of their Idol to this odious Violence than to own it from the consent of a willing People as if they thought that as all Action must be sutable to its Principle so that which is unjust in its practice ought to scorn to be deriv'd from that which is not detestable in its principle 'Tis hardly worth our pains to examin whether the Nations that went from  Babel  after the confusion of Languages were more or less than seventy two for they seem not to have gone according to Familys but every one to have associated himself to those that understood his Speech and the chief of the Fathers as  Noah  and his Sons were not there or were subject to  Nimrod  each of which Points doth destroy even in the Root all pretence to Paternal Government Besides 'tis evident in Scripture that  Noah  liv'd three hundred and fifty Years after the Flood  Shem  five hundred  Abraham  was born about two hundred and ninety Years after the Flood and liv'd one hundred seventy five Years He was therefore born under the Government of  Noah  and died under that of  Shem  He could not therefore exercise a regal Power whilst he liv'd for that was in  Shem  So that in leaving his Country and setting up a Family for himself that never acknowledg'd any Superior and never pretending to reign over any other he fully shew'd he  thought himself free and to owe subjection to none And being as far from arrogating to himself any Power upon the Title of Paternity as from acknowledging it in any other left every one to the same liberty  The punctual enumeration of the Years that the Fathers of the holy Seed lived gives us ground of making a more than probable conjecture that they of the collateral Lines were in number of days not unequal to them and if that be true  Ham  and  Chush  were alive when  Nimrod  set himself up to be King He must therefore have usurp'd this Power over his Father Grandfather and great Grandfather or which is more probable he turn'd into Violence and Oppression the Power given him by a Multitude which like a Flock without a Shepherd not knowing whom to obey set him up to be their Chief I leave to our Author the liberty of chusing which of these two dos best sute with his Paternal Monarchy but as far as I can understand the first is directly against it as well as against the Laws of God and Man the other being from the consent of the Multitude cannot be extended farther than they would have it nor turn'd to their prejudice without the most abominable ingratitude and treachery from whence no Right can be deriv'd nor any justifiable Example taken  Nevertheless if our Author resolve that  Abraham  was also a King he must presume that  Shem  did emancipate him before he went to seek his Fortune This was not a Kingly posture but I will not contradict him if I may know over whom he reign'd Paternal Monarchy is exercis'd by the Father of the Family over his Descendents or such as had bin under the Dominion of him whose Heir he is But  Abraham  had neither of these Those of his nearest Kindred continu'd in  Mesopotamia  as appears by what is said of  Bethuel  and  Laban  He had only  Lot  with him over whom he pretended no right He had no Children till he was a hundred Years old that is to say he was a King without a Subject and then he had but one I have heard that  Omnisque potestas impatiens consortis erit  Lucan  Sovereigns do impatiently bear Competitors  but now I find Subjection also doth admit of none  Abraham  's Kingdom was too great when he had two Children and to disburden it  Ishmael  must be expel'd soon aster the birth of  Isaac  He observ'd the same method after the death of  Sarah  He had Children by  Keturah  but he gave them Gifts and sent 'em away leaving  Isaac  like a Stoical King reigning in and over himself without any other Subject till the birth of  Jacob  and  Esau  But his Kingdom was not to be of a larger extent than that of his Father The two Twins could not agree  Jacob  was sent away by his Mother he reign'd over  Esau  only and 'tis not easy to determin who was the Heir of his worldly Kingdom for tho  Jacob  had the birthright we do not find he had any other Goods than what he had gotten in  Laban  's service If our Author say true the right of Primogeniture with the Dominion perpetually annex'd by the Laws of God and Nature must go to the eldest  Isaac  therefore tho he had not bin deceiv'd could not have conser'd it upon the younger for Man cannot overthrow what God and Nature have instituted  Jacob  in the CourtLanguage had bin a double Rebel in beguiling his Father and supplanting his Brother The blessing of being Lord over his Brethren could not have taken place Or if  Isaac  had Power and his Act was good the Prerogative of the Elder is not rooted in the Law of God or Nature but is a matter of conveniency only which may be chang'd at the Will of the Father whether he know what he dos or not But if this Paternal Right to Dominion were of any value or Dominion over Men  were a thing to be desir'd why did  Abraham Isaac  and  Jacob  content themselves with such a narrow Territory when after the death of their Ancestors they ought according to that rule to have bin Lords of the World All Authors conclude that  Shem  was the eldest by birth or prefer'd by the appointment of God so as the Right must have bin in him and from him transmitted to  Abraham  and  Isaac  but if they were so possest with the contemplation of a Heavenly Kingdom as not to care for the greatest on Earth 'tis strange that  Esau  whose modesty is not much commended should so far forget his Interest as neither to lay claim to the Empire of the World nor dispute with his Brother the possession of the Field and Cave bought by  Abraham  but rather to fight for a dwelling on Mount  Seir  that was neither possest by nor promis'd to his Fathers If he was fallen from his Right  Jacob  might have claim'd it but God was his Inheritance and being assur'd of his Blessing he contented himself with what he could gain by his Industry in a way that was not at all sutable to the Pomp and Majesty of a King Which way soever therefore the business be turn'd whether according to  Isaac  's Blessing  Esau  should serve  Jacob  or to our Author's opinion  Jacob  must serve  Esau  neither of the two was effected in their Persons And the Kingdom of two being divided into two each of them remain'd Lord of himself  SECT IX The Power of a Father belongs only to a Father  THIS leads us to an easy determination of the Question which our Author thinks insoluble  If  Adam  was Lord of his Children he dos not see how any can be free from the subjection of his Parents  For as no good Man will ever desire to be free from the respect that is due to his Father who did beget and educate him no wise Man will ever think the like to be due to his Brother or Nephew that did neither If  Esau  and  Jacob  were equally free if  Noah  as our Author affirms divided  Europe Asia  and  Africa  amongst his three Sons tho he can't prove it and if seventy two Nations under so many Heads or Kings went from  Babylon  to people the Earth about a hundred and thirty years after the Flood I know not why according to the same rule and proportion it may not be safely concluded that in four thousand years Kings are so multiplied as to be in number equal to the Men that are in the World that is to say they are according to the Laws of God and Nature all free and independent upon each other as  Shem Ham  and  Japhet  were And therefore tho  Adam  and  Noah  had reign'd alone when there were no Men in the World except such as issu'd from them that is no reason why any other should reign over those that he has not begotten As the Right of  Noah  was divided amongst the Children he lest and when he was dead no one of them depended on the other because no one of them was Father of the other and the Right of a Father can only belong to him that is so the like must for ever attend every other Father in the World This paternal Power must necessarily accrue to every Father He is a King by the same Right as the Sons of  Noah  and how numerous soever Familys may be upon the increase of Mankind they are all free till they agree  to recede from their own Right and join together in or under one Government according to such Laws as best please themselves  SECT X Such as enter into Society must in some degree diminish their Liberty  REASON leads them to this No one Man or Family is able to provide that which is requisite for their convenience or security whilst every one has an equal Right to every thing and none acknowledges a Superior to determin the Controversys that upon such occasions must continually arise and will probably be so many and great that Mankind cannot bear them Therefore tho I do not believe that  Bellarmin  said a Commonwealth could not exercise its Power for he could not be ignorant that  Rome  and  Athens  did exercise theirs and that all the Regular Kingdoms in the World are Commonwealths yet there is nothing of absurdity in saying That Man cannot continue in the perpetual and intire fruition of the Liberty that God has given him The Liberty of one is thwarted by that of another and whilst they are all equal none will yield to any otherwise than by a general consent This is the ground of all just Governments for Violence or Fraud can create no Right and the same consent gives the Form to them all how much soever they differ from each other Some small numbers of Men living within the Precincts of one City have as it were cast into a common Stock the Right which they had of governing themselves and Children and by common Consent joining in one body exercis'd such Power over every single Person as seem'd beneficial to the whole and this Men call perfect  Democracy  Others chose rather to be govern'd by a select number of such as most excell'd in Wisdom and Vertue and this according to the signification of the word was call'd  Aristocracy  Or when one Man excell'd all others the Government was put into his hands under the name of  Monarchy  But the wisest best and far the greatest part of Mankind rejecting these simple Species did form Governments mix'd or compos'd of the three as shall be prov'd hereafter which commonly receiv'd their respective Denomination from the Part that prevail'd and did deserve praise or blame as they were well or ill proportion'd  It were a solly hereupon to say that the Liberty for which we contend is of no use to us since we cannot endure the Solitude Barbarity Weakness Want Misery and Dangers that accompany it whilst we live alone nor can enter into a Society without resigning it for the choice of that Society and the liberty of framing it according to our own Wills for our own good is all we seek This remains to us whilst we sorm Governments that we our selves are Judges how far 'tis good for us to recede srom our natural Liberty which is of so great importance that from thence only we can know whether we are Freemen or Slaves and the difference between the best Government and the worst dos wholly depend upon a right or wrong exercise of that Power If Men are naturally free such as have Wisdom and Understanding will always frame good Governments But if they are born under the necessity of a perpetual Slavery no Wisdom can be of use to them but all must for ever depend on the Will of their Lords how cruel mad proud or wicked soever they be  SECT XI No Man comes to command many unless by Consent or by Force  BUT because I cannot believe God has created Man in such a state of Misery and Slavery as I just now mention'd by discovering the vanity of our Author's whimsical Patriarchical Kingdom I am led to a certain conclusion That every Father of a Family is free and exempt from the domination of any other as the seventy two that went from  Babel  were 'Tis hard to comprehend how one Man can come to be master of many equal to himself in Right unless it be by Consent or by Force If by Consent we are at an end of our Controversys Governments and the Magistrats that execute them are created by Man They who give a being to them cannot but have a right of regulating limiting and directing them as best pleases themselves and all our Author's Assertions concerning the absolute Power of one Man fall to the ground If by Force we are to examin how it can be possible or justifiable This subduing by Force we call Conquest but as he that forces must be stronger than those that are forc'd to talk of one Man who in strength exceeds many millions of Men is to go beyond the extravagance of Fables and Romances This Wound is not cur'd by saying that he first conquers one and then more and with their help others for as to matter of fact the first news we hear of  Nimrod  is that he reign'd over a great multitude and built vast Citys and we know of no Kingdom in the World that did not begin with a greater number than any one Man could possibly subdue If they who chuse one to be their Head did under his conduct subdue others they were Fellowconquerors with him and nothing can be more brutish than to think that by their Vertue and Valour they had purchas'd perpetual Slavery to themselves and their Posterity But if it were possible it could not be justifiable and whilst our Dispute is concerning Right that which ought not to be is no more to be receiv'd than if it could not be No Right can come by conquest unless there were a Right of making that Conquest which by reason of the Equality that our Author confesses to have bin amongst the Heads of Familys and as I have prov'd goes into Infinity can never be on the Aggressor's side No Man can justly impose any thing upon those who owe him nothing Our Author therefore who  ascribes the enlargement of  Nimrod  's Kingdom to Ʋsurpation and Tyranny  might as well have acknowledg'd the same in the beginning as he says all other Authors have done However he ought not to have imputed to Sir  Walter Raleigh  an Approbation of his Right as Lord or King over his Family sor he could never think him to be a Lord by the right of a Father who by that rule must have liv'd and died a Slave to his Fathers that overliv'd him Whosoever therefore like  Nimrod  grounds his pretensions of Right upon Usurpation and Tyranny declares himself to be like  Nimrod  a Usurper and a Tyrant that is an Enemy to God and Man and to have no Right at all That which was unjust in its beginning can of it self never change its nature  Tempus in  e  saith  Grotius nullam habet vim effectricem  He that persists in doing Injustice aggravates it and takes upon himself all the guilt of his Predecessors But if there be a King in the World that claims a Right by Conquest  and would justify it he might do well to tell whom he conquer'd when with what assistance and upon what reason he undertook the War for he can ground no title upon the obscurity of an unsearchable antiquity and if he dos it not he ought to be look'd upon as a usurping  Nimrod  SECT XII The pretended Paternal Right is divisible or indivisible if divisible 'tis extinguish'd if indivisible universal  THis paternal right to Regality if there be any thing in it is divisible or indivisible if indivisible as  Adam  has but one Heir one Man is rightly Lord of the whole World and neither  Nimrod  nor any of his Successors could ever have bin Kings nor the seventy two that went from  Babylon Noah  surviv'd him near two hundred years  Shem  continu'd one hundred and fifty years longer The Dominion must have bin in him and by him transmitted to his Posterity for ever Those that call themselves Kings in all other Nations set themselves up against the Law of God and Nature This is the Man we are to seek out that we may yield obedience to him I know not where to find him but he must be of the race of  Abraham Shem  was prefer'd before his Brethren The Inheritance that could not be divided must come to him and from him to  Isaac  who was the first of his Descendents that outliv'd him 'Tis pity that  Jacob  did not know this and that the Lord of all the Earth thro ignorance of his Title should be forc'd to keep one of his Subjects Sheep for wages and strange that he who had wit enough to supplant his Brother did so little understand his own bargain as not to know that he had bought the perpetual Empire of the World If in conscience he could not take such a price for a dish of Pottage it must remain in  Esau  However our Lord Paramount must come from  Isaac  If the Deed of Sale made by  Esau  be good we must seek him amongst the  Jews  if he could not so easily devest himself of his Right it must remain amongst his Descendents who are  Turks  We need not scruple the reception of either since the late  Scots  Act tells us  That Kings derive their Royal Power from God alone and no difference of Religion c can divert the right of Succession  But I know not what we shall do if we cannot find this Man for  de non apparentibus non existentibus eadem est ratio  The Right must fall if there be none to inherit If we do not know who he is that has the Right we do not know who is near to him All Mankind must inherit the Right to which every one has an equal title and that which is Dominion if in one when 'tis equally divided among all Men is that universal Liberty which I assert Wherefore I leave it to the choice of such as have inherited our Author's opinions to produce this  Jew  or  Turk  that ought to be Lord of the whole Earth or to prove a better title in some other Person and to persuade all the Princes and Nations of the World to submit If this be not done it must be confest this Paternal Right is a mere whimsical Fiction and that no Man by birth has a Right above another or can have any unless by the concession of those who are concern'd  If this Right to an universal Empire be divisible and  Noah  did actually divide it among his three Sons if seventy and two absolute Monarchs  did at once arise out of the Multitude that had assembl'd at  Babel Noah  nor his Sons nor any of the holy Seed nor probably any elder than  Nimrod  having bin there many other Monarchs must necessarily have arisen from them also  Abraham  as our Author says was a King  Lot  must have bin so also for they were equals his Sons  Ammon  and  Moab  had no dependence upon the Descendents of  Abraham Ismael  and  Esau  set up for themselves and great Nations came of them  Abraham  's Sons by  Keturah  did so also that is to say every one as soon as he came to be of age to provide for himself did so without retaining any dependence upon the Stock from whence he came Those of that Stock or the Head of it pretended to no Right over those who went from them Nay nearness in Blood was so little regarded that tho  Lot  was  Abraham  's Brother's Son  Eliezer  his Servant had bin his Heir if he had died childless The like continu'd among  Jacob  's Sons no Jurisdiction was given to one above the rest an equal division of Land was made amongst 'em Their Judges and Magistrats were of several Tribes and Familys without any other preference of one before another than what did arise from the advantages God had given to any particular Person This I take to be a proof of the utmost extent and certainty that the Equality amongst Mankind was then perfect He therefore that will deny it to be so now ought to prove that neither the Prophets Patriarchs or any other Men did ever understand or regard the Law deliver'd by God and Nature to Mankind or that having bin common and free at the first and so continu'd for many hundreds of years after the Flood it was afterwards abolish'd and a new one introduc'd He that asserts this must prove it but till it dos appear to us when where how and by whom this was done we may safely believe there is no such thing and that no Man is or can be a Lord amongst us till we make him so and that by nature we are all Brethren  Our Author by endeavouring farther to illustrate the Patriarchical Power destroys it and cannot deny to any Man the Right which he acknowledges to have bin in  Ismael  and  Esau  But if every Man has a Right of setting up for himself with his Family or before he has any he cannot but have a right of joining with others if he pleases as his joining or not joining with others and the choice of those others depends upon his own will he cannot but have a right of judging upon what conditions 'tis good for him to enter into such a Society as must necessarily hinder him from exercising the Right which he has originally in himself But as it cannot be imagin'd that Men should generally put such Fetters upon themselves unless it were in expectation of a greater good thereby to accrue to them no more can be requir'd to prove that they do voluntarily enter into these Societys institute them for their own good and prescribe such Rules and Forms to them as best please themselves without giving account to any But if every Man be free till he enter into such a Society as he chuses for his own good and those Societys may regulate themselves as they think sit no more can be requir'd to prove the natural Equality in which all Men are born and continue till they resign it as into a common stock in such measure as they think fit for the constituting of Societys for their own good which I assert and our Author denies  SECT XIII There was no shadow of a Paternal Kingdom amongst the Hebrews nor precept for it  OUR Author is so modest to confess that  Jacob  's Kingdom consisting of seventy two Persons was swallow'd up by the power of the greater Monarch  Pharaoh  But if this was an Act of Tyranny 'tis strange that the sacred and eternal Right grounded upon the immutable Laws of God and Nature should not be restor'd to God's chosen People when he deliver'd them from that Tyranny Why was not  Jacob  's Monarchy confer'd upon his right Heir How came the People to neglect a Point of such importance Or if they did forget it why did not  Moses  put 'em in mind of it Why did not  Jacob  declare to whom it did belong Or if he is understood to have declar'd it in saying the Scepter should not depart srom  Judah  why was it not deliver'd into his hands or into his Heirs If he was hard to be found in a People of one kindred but four degrees remov'd from  Jacob  their Head who were exact in observing Genealogys how can we hope to find him after so many thousand years when we do not so much as know from whom we are deriv'd Or rather how comes that Right which is eternal and universal to have bin nip'd in the bud and so abolish'd before it could take any effect in the World as never to have bin heard of amongst the  Gentiles  nor the People of God either before or after the Captivity from the death of  Jacob  to this day This I assert and I give up the Cause if I do not prove it To this end I begin with  Moses  and  Aaron  the first Rulers of the People who were neither of the eldest Tribe according to birth nor the disposition of  Jacob  if he did or could give it to any nor were they of the eldest Line of their own Tribe and even between them the Superiority was given to  Moses  who was the younger as 'tis said  I have made thee a God to  Pharaoh  and  Aaron  thy Brother shall be thy Prophet  If  Moses  was a King as our Author says but I deny and shall hereafter prove the matter is worse He must have bin an Usurper of a most unjust Dominion over his Brethren and this Patriarchical power which by the Law of God was to be perpetually fix'd in his Descendents perish'd with him and his Sons continu'd in an obscure rank amongst the Levites  Joshua  of the Tribe of  Ephraim  succeeded him  Othniel  was of  Judah Ehud  of  Benjamin Barak  of  Napthalim  and  Gideon  of  Manasseh  The other Judges were of several Tribes and they being dead their Children lay hid among the common People and we hear no more of 'em The first King was taken out of the least Family of the least and youngest Tribe The second whilst the Children of the first King were yet alive was the youngest of eight Sons of an obscure Man in the Tribe of  Judah Solomon  one of his youngest Sons succeeded him Ten Tribes deserted  Rehoboam  and by the command of God set up  Joroboam  to be their King The Kingdom of  Israel  by the destruction of one Family pass'd into another That of  Judah  by God's peculiar promise continu'd in  David  's race till the Captivity but we know not that the eldest Son was always prefer'd and have no reason to presume it  David  their most reverenced King left no precept sor it and gave an example to the contrary he did not set up the Eldest  but the Wisest After the Captivity they who had most wisdom or valour to defend the People were thought most fit to command and the Kingdom at the last came to the  Asmonean  Race whilst the Posterity of  David  was buried in the mass of the common People and utterly depriv'd of all worldly Rule or Glory If the Judges had not a Regal Power or the Regal were only just as instituted by God and eternally annex'd to Paternity all that they did was evil There could be nothing of Justice in the Powers exercis'd by  Moses Joshua Gideon Samuel  and the rest of the Judges If the Power was regal and just it must have continu'd in the Descendents of the first  Saul David  and  Solomon  could never have bin Kings The Right failing in them their Descendents could inherit none from them and the others after the Captivity were guilty of the like injustice  Now as the Rule is not general to which there is any one just exception there is not one of these Examples that would not overthrow our Author's Doctrin If one deviation from it were lawful another might be and so to infinity But the utmost degree of impudent madness to which perhaps any Man in the world has ever arriv'd is to assert that to be universal and perpetual which cannot be verify'd by any one Example to have bin in any place of the World nor justify'd by any Precept  If it be objected That all these things were done by God's immediat disposition I answer that it were an impious madness to believe that God did perpetually send his Prophets to overthrow what he had ordain'd from the beginning and as it were in spite to bring the minds of Men into inextricable confusion and darkness and by particular Commands to overthrow his universal and eternal Law But to render this point more clear I desire it may be consider'd That we have but three ways of distinguishing between good and evil  When God by his Word reveals it to us  When by his Deeds he declares it because that which he dos is good as that which he says is true  By the Light of Reason which is good in as much as it is from God  And first It cannot be said we have an explicit word for that continuance of the Power in the eldest for it appears not and having none we might conclude it to be lest to our liberty For it agrees not with the goodness of God to leave us in a perpetual ignorance of his Will in a matter of so great importance nor to have suffer'd his own People or any other to persist without the least reproof or admonition in a perpetual opposition to it if it had displeas'd him  To the  d  The Dispensations of his Providence which are the emanations of his Will have gone contrary to this pretended Law There can therefore be no such thing for God is constant to himself his Works do not contradict his Word and both of them do equally declare to us that which is good  Thirdly If there be any Precept that by the light of Nature we can in matters of this kind look upon as certain 'tis that the Government of a People should be given to him that can best perform the Dutys of it No Man has it sor himself or from himsels but for and from those who before he had it were his Equals that he may do good to them If there were a Man who in Wisdom Valour Justice and Purity surpass'd all others he might be call'd a King by Nature because he is best able to bear the weight of so great a charge and like a good Shepherd to lead the People to good  Detur digniori  is the voice of Reason and that we may  be sure  Detur seniori  is not so  Solomon  tells us  That a wise Child is better than an old and foolish King  But if this pretended Right do not belong to him that is truly the eldest nothing can be more absurd than a fantastical pretence to a Right deduc'd from him that is not so Now lest I should be thought to follow my own Inventions and call them Reason or the Light of God in us I desire it may be observ'd that God himself has ever taken this method When he rais'd up  Moses  to be the leader of his People he endow'd him with the most admirable gifts of his Spirit that ever he bestow'd upon a Man When he chose seventy Men to assist him he endow'd them with the same spirit  Joshua  had no other title to succeed him than the like evidence of God's Presence with him When the People thro sin fell into misery he did not seek out their Descendents nor such as boasted in a prerogative of Birth but shew'd whom he design'd for their Deliverer by bestowing such gifts upon him as were requir'd for the performance of his work and never fail'd of doing this till that miserable sinful People rejecting God and his Government desir'd that which was in use among their accursed Neighbours that they might be as like to them in the most shameful Slavery to Man as in the Worship of Idols set up against God  But if this pretended Right be grounded upon no word or work of God not the reason of Man 'tis to be accounted a mere figment that has nothing of truth in it  SECT XIV If the paternal Right had included Dominion and was to be transfer'd to a single Heir it must perish if he were not known and could be applied to no other Person  HAving shew'd that the first Kings were not Fathers nor the first Fathers Kings that all the Kings of the  Jews  and  Gentiles  mention'd in Scripture came in upon Titles different from and inconsistent with that of Paternity and that we are not led by the Word nor the Works of God nor the Reason of Man or Light of Nature to believe there is any such thing we may safely conclude there never was any such thing or that it never had any effect which to us is the same 'Tis as ridiculous to think of retrieving that which from the beginning of the World was lost as to create that which never was But I may go farther and affirm that tho there had bin such a Right in the first Fathers of Mankind exercis'd by them and for some ages individually transmitted to their eldest Sons it must necessarily perish since the Generations of Men are so confus'd that no Man knows his own original and consequently this Heir is no where to be found for 'tis a folly for a Man to pretend to an Inheritance who cannot prove himself to be the right Heir If this be not true I desire to know from which of  Noah  's Sons the Kings of  England France  or  Spain  do deduce their original or what reason they can give why the title to Dominion which is fancied to be in  Noah  did rather belong to the first of their respective Races that attain'd to the Crowns they now enjoy than to the meanest Peasant of their Kingdoms or how that can be transmitted to them which was not in the first We know that no Man can give what he has not that if there be no giver  there is no gift if there be no root there can be no branch and that the first point failing all that should be deriv'd from it must necessarily fail  Our Author who is good at resolving difficultys shews us an easy way out of this strait  'Tis true  says he  all Kings are not natural Parents of their Subjects yet they either are or are to be reputed the next Heirs to those first Progenitors who were at first the natural Parents of the whole People and in their right succeed to the exercise of the supreme Jurisdiction and such Heirs are not only Lords of their own Children but also of their Brethren and all those that were subject to their Father c By this means it comes to pass that many a Child succeeding a King hath the right of a Father over many a greyheaded multitude and hath the title of  Pater Patriae  An Assertion comprehending so many Points upon which the most important Rights of all Mankind do depend might deserve some proof But he being of opinion we ought to take it upon his credit dos not vouchsafe to give us so much as the shadow of any Nevertheless being unwilling either crudely to receive or rashly to reject it I shall take the liberty of examining the Proposition and hope I may be pardon'd if I dwell a little more than ordinarily upon that which is the foundation of his Work  We are beholden to him for confessing modestly that all Kings are not the natural Fathers of their People and sparing us the pains of proving that the Kings of  Persia  who reign'd from the  Indies  to the  Hellespont  did not beget all the Men that liv'd in those Countrys or that the Kings of  France  and  Spain  who began to reign before they were five years old were not the natural Fathers of the Nations under them But if all Kings are not Fathers none are as they are Kings If any one is or ever was the Rights of Paternity belong to him and to no other who is not so also This must be made evident for matters of such importance require proof and ought not to be taken upon supposition If  Filmer  therefore will pretend that the right of Father belongs to any one King he must prove that he is the Father of his People for otherwise it dos not appertain to him he is not the Man we seek  'Tis no less absurd to say he is to be reputed Heir to the first Progenitor for it must be first prov'd that the Nation did descend from one single Progenitor without mixture of other races That this Progenitor was the Man to whom  Noah  according to  Filmer  's whimsical division of  Asia Europe  and  Africa  among his Sons did give the Land now inhabited by that People That this Division so made was not capable of Subdivisions and that this Man is by a true and uninterrupted Succession descended from the first and eldest Line of that Progenitor and all fails if every one of these points be not made good If there never was any such Man who had that Right it cannot be inherited from him If by the same rule that a parcel of the World was allotted to him that parcel might be subdivided amongst his Children as they increas'd the subdivisions may be infinite and the right of Dominion thereby destroy'd If several Nations inhabit the same Land they owe obedience to several Fathers that which is due to their true Father cannot be render'd to him that is not so for he would by that means be depriv'd of the Right which is inseparably annex'd to his Person And lastly whatsoever the Right of an Heir may be it can belong only to him that is Heir  Lest any should be seduc'd from these plain Truths by frivolous suggestions 'tis good to consider that the title of  Pater Patriae  with which our Author would cheat us has no relation to the matters of Right upon  which we dispute 'Tis a figurative speech that may have bin rightly enough applied to some excellent Princes on account of their care and love to their People resembling that of a Father to his Children and can relate to none but those who had it No man that had common sense or valu'd truth did ever call  Phalaris Dionysius Nabis Nero  or  Caligula  Fathers of their Countrys but Monsters that to the utmost of their power endeavour'd their destruction which is enough to prove that sacred Name cannot be given to all and in consequence to none but such as by their Virtue Piety and good Government do deserve it  These matters will yet appear more evident if it be consider'd that tho  Noah  had reign'd as a King that  Zoroaster  as some suppose was  Ham  who reign'd over his Children and that thereby some Right might perhaps be deriv'd to such as succeeded them yet this can have no influence upon such as have not the like Original and no man is to be presum'd to have it till it be prov'd since we have prov'd that many had it not If  Nimrod  set himself up against his Grandfather and if  Ninus  who was descended from him in the fifth Generation slew him they ill deserv'd the name and rights of Fathers and none but those who have renounc'd all Humanity Virtue and common Sense can give it to them or their Successors If therefore  Noah  and  Shem  had not so much as the shadow of Regal Power and the actions of  Nimrod Ninus  and others who were Kings in their times shew they did not reign in the right of Fathers but were set up in a direct opposition to it the titles of the first Kings were not from Paternity nor consistent with it  Our Author therefore who should have prov'd every point dos neither prove any one nor assert that which is agreeable to divine or human Story as to matter of fact and as little conformable to common sense It dos not only appear contrary to his general Proposition That all Governments have not begun with the Paternal Power but we do not find that any ever did They who according to his rules should have bin Lords of the whole Earth liv'd and died private men whilst the most wicked and boisterous of their Children commanded the greatest part of the then inhabited World not excepting even those Countrys where they spent and ended their days and instead of entring upon the Government by the right of Fathers or managing it as Fathers they did by the most outrageous injustice usurp a violent Domination over their Brethren and Fathers  It may easily be imagin'd what the Right is that could be thus acquir'd and transmitted to their Successors Nevertheless our Author says  All Kings either are or ought to be reputed next Heirs  c But why reputed if they are not How could any of the accursed race of  Ham  be reputed Father of  Noah  or  Shem  to whom he was to be a Servant How could  Nimrod  and  Ninus  be reputed Fathers of  Ham  and of those whom they ought to have obey'd Can Reason oblige me to believe that which I know to be false Can a Lie that is hateful to God and good Men not only be excus'd but enjoin'd when as he will perhaps say it is for the King's Service Can I serve two Masters or without the most unpardonable injustice repute him to be my Father who is not my Father and pay the obedience due to him who did beget and educate me to one from whom I never receiv'd any good If this be so absurd that no man dares affirm it in the person of any 'tis as preposterous in relation to his Heirs For  Nimrod  the first King could be Heir to no man as King and could transmit to no man a Right which he had not If it was ridiculous  and abominable to say that he was Father of  Chush Ham Shem  and  Noah  'tis as ridiculous to say he had the Right of Father if he was not their Father or that his Successors inherited it from him if he never had it If there be any way thro this it must have accru'd to him by the extirpation of all his Elders and their Races so as he who will assert this pretended Right to have bin in the  Babylonian  Kings must assert that  Noah Shem Japhet Ham Chush  and all  Nimrod  's elder Brothers with all their Descendents were utterly extirpated before he began to reign and all Mankind to be descended from him  This must be if  Nimrod  as the Scripture says was the first that became mighty in the Earth unless men might be Kings without having more Power than others for  Chush Ham  and  Noah  were his Elders and Progenitors in the direct Line and all the Sons of  Shem  and  Japhet  and their Descendents in the Collaterals were to be prefer'd before him and he could have no Right at all that was not directly contrary to those Principles which our Author says are grounded upon the eternal and indispensable Laws of God and Nature The like may be said of the seventy two Heads of Colonys which following as I suppose Sir  Walter Raleigh  he says went out to people the Earth and whom he calls Kings for according to the same Rule  Noah Shem  and  Japhet  with their Descendents could not be of the number so that neither  Nimrod  nor the others that establish'd the Kingdoms of the World and from whence he thinks all the rest to be deriv'd could have any thing of Justice in them unless it were from a Root altogether inconsistent with his Principles They are therefore false or the Establishments beforemention'd could have no Right If they had none they cannot be reputed to have any for no man can think that to be true which he knows to be false having none they could transmit none to their Heirs and Successors And if we are to believe that all the Kingdoms of the Earth are establish'd upon this Paternal Right it must be prov'd that all those who in birth ought to have bin prefer'd before  Nimrod  and the seventy two were extirpated or that the first and true Heir of  Noah  did afterwards abolish all these unjust Usurpations and making himself Master of the whole left it to his Heirs in whom it continues to this day When this is done I will acknowledg the Foundation to be well laid and admit of all that can be rightly built upon it but if this fails all fails The poison of the Root continues in the Branches If the right Heir be not in possession he is not the right who is in possession If the true Heir be known he ought to be restor'd to his Right If he be not known the Right must perish For nothing can be said to belong to any man if no man knows to whom it belongs and can have no more effect than if it were not This conclusion will continue unmovable tho the division into seventy two Kingdoms were allow'd which cannot be without destroying the Paternal Power or subjecting it to be subdivided into as many parcels as there are men which destroys Regality for the same thing may be requir'd in every one of the distinct Kingdoms and others deriv'd from them Or we must know who was that true Heir of  Noah  that recover'd all How when and to whom he gave the several Portions and that every one of them do continue in the possession of those who by this prerogative of Birth are rais'd above the rest of mankind and if they are not 'tis an impious folly to repute them so to the prejudice of those that are and if they do not appear to the prejudice of all mankind who being equal are thereby made subject to them For as Truth is the Rule of Justice  there can be none when he is reputed superior to all who is certainly inferior to  In this place two Pages are wanting in the Original Manuscript  degenerated from that Reason which distinguishes men from beasts Tho it may be fit to use some Ceremonys before a man be admitted to practise Physick or set up a Trade 'tis his own Skill that makes him a Doctor or an Artificer and others do but declare it An Ass will not leave his stupidity tho he be cover'd with Scarlet and he that is by nature a Slave will be so still tho a Crown be put upon his Head and 'tis hard to imagin a more violent inversion of the Laws of God and Nature than to raise him to the Throne whom Nature intended for the Chain or to make them Slaves to Slaves whom God has endow'd with the Virtues requir'd in Kings Nothing can be more preposterous than to impute to God the frantick Domination which is often exercis'd by wicked foolish and vile Persons over the wise valiant just and good or to subject the best to the rage of the worst If there be any Family therefore in the world that can by the Law of God and Nature distinct from the Ordinance of Man pretend to an hereditary Right of Dominion over any People it must be one that never did and never can produce any Person that is not free from all the Infirmitys and Vices that render him unable to exercise the Sovereign Power and is endow'd with all the Virtues requir'd to that end or at least a Promise from God verify'd by Experience that the next in Blood shall ever be able and fit for that work But since we do not know that any such has yet appear'd in the World we have no reason to believe that there is or ever was any such and consequently none upon whom God has confer'd the Rights that cannot be exercis'd without them  If there was no shadow of a Paternal Right in the Institution of the Kingdoms of  Saul  and  David  there could be none in those that succeeded  Rehoboam  could have no other than from  Solomon  When he reign'd over two Tribes and  Jeroboam  over ten 'tis not possible that both of 'em could be the next Heir of their last common Father  Jacob  and 'tis absurd to say that ought to be reputed which is impossible for our thoughts are ever to be guided by Truth or such an appearance of it as dos persuade or convince us  The same Title of Father is yet more ridiculously or odiously apply'd to the succeeding Kings  Baasha  had no other Title to the Crown than by killing  Nadab  the Son of  Jeroboam  and destroying his Family  Zimri  purchas'd the same honour by the slaughter of  Elah  when he was drunk and dealing with the House of  Baasha  as he had done with that of  Jeroboam Zimri  burning himself transfer'd the same to  Omri  as a reward for bringing him to that extremity As  Jehu  was more fierce than these he seems to have gain'd a more excellent recompence than any since  Jeroboam  even a conditional Promise of a perpetual Kingdom but falling from these glorious Privileges purchas'd by his Zeal in killing two wicked Kings and above one hundred of their Brethren  Shallum  must have inherited them by destroying  Zachary  and all that remain'd of his Race This in plain English is no less than to say that whosoever kills a King and invades a Crown tho the act and means of accomplishing it be never so detestable dos thereby become Father of his Country and Heir of all the Divine Privileges annex'd to that glorious Inheritance And tho  I cannot tell whether such a Doctrin be more sottish monstrous or impious I dare affirm that if it were receiv'd no King in the World could think himself safe in his Throne for one day They are already encompast with many dangers but lest Pride Avarice Ambition Lust Rage and all the Vices that usually reign in the hearts of worldly men should not be sufficient to invite 'em perpetually to disturb Mankind thro the desire of gaining the Power Riches and Splendor that accompany a Crown our Author proposes to 'em the most sacred Privileges as a reward of the most execrable Crimes He that was stir'd up only by the violence of his own Nature thought that a Kingdom could never be bought at too dear a rate  Pro Regno velim  Patriam Penates conjugem flammis dare  Imperia precio quolibet constant bene  Senec Theb  But if the sacred Character of God's Anointed or Vicegerent and Father of a Country were added to the other Advantages that follow the highest Fortunes the most modest and just men would be fill'd with fury that they might attain to them Nay it may be even the best would be the most forward in conspiring against such as reign they who could not be tempted with external Pleasures would be most in love with divine Privileges and since they should become the sacred Ministers of God if they succeeded and Traitors or Rogues only if they miscarried their only care would be so to lay their Designs that they might be surely executed This is a Doctrin worthy of  Filmer  's Invention and  Heylin  's Approbation which being well weigh'd will shew to all good and just Kings how far they are oblig'd to those who under pretence of advancing their Authority fill the minds of men with such Notions as are so desperatly pernicious to them  SECT XVI The Antients chose those to be Kings who excell'd in the Virtues that are most beneficial to Civil Societys  IF the  Israelites  whose Lawgiver was God had no King in the first Institution of their Government 'tis no wonder that other Nations should not think themselves oblig'd to set up any if they who came all of one stock and knew their Genealogys when they did institute Kings had no regard to our Author's Chimerical right of Inheritance nor were taught by God or his Prophets to have any 'tis not strange that Nations who did not know their own Original and who probably if not certainly came of several Stocks never put themselves to the trouble of seeking one who by his birth deserv'd to be prefer'd before others and various Changes happening in all Kingdoms whereby in process of time the Crowns were transported into divers Familys to which the Right of Inheritance could not without the utmost impiety and madness be imputed such a fancy certainly could only enter into the heads of Fools and we know of none so foolish to have harbour'd it  The  Grecians  amongst others who follow'd the Light of Reason knew no other original Title to the Government of a Nation than that Wisdom  Valour and Justice which was beneficial to the People These Qualitys gave beginning to those Governments which we call  Heroum Regna  and the Veneration paid to such as enjoy'd them proceeded from a grateful sense of the Good receiv'd from them They were thought to be descended from the Gods who in Vertue and Beneficence surpass'd other men The same attended their Descendents till they came to abuse their Power and by their Vices shew'd themselves like to or worse than others Those Nations did not seek the most antient but the most worthy and thought such only worthy to be prefer'd before others who could best perform their Duty The  Spartans  knew that  Hercules  and  Achilles  were not their Fathers for they were a Nation before either of them were born but thinking their Children might be like to them in Valour they brought them from  Thebes  and  Epirus  to be their Kings If our Author is of another opinion I desire to know whether the  Heraclidae  or the  Aeacidae  were or ought to be reputed Fathers of the  Lacedemonians  for if the one was the other was not  The same method was follow'd in  Italy  and they who esteem'd themselves  Qui rupto robore nati  Compositi  Luto millos habuere parentes  Juven Sat  Aborigines  could not set up one to govern them under the Title of  Parent  They could pay no veneration to any Man under the name of a common Father who thought they had none and they who esteem'd themselves equal could have no reason to prefer any one unless he were distinguish'd from others by the Vertues that were beneficial to all This may be illustrated by matters of fact  Romulus  and  Remus  the Sons of a Nun constuprated as is probable by a lusty Soldier who was said to be  Mars  for their Vigour and Valour were made heads of a gather'd People We know not that ever they had any Children but we are sure they could not be Fathers of the People that flock'd to them from several places nor in any manner be reputed Heirs of him or them that were so for they never knew who was their own Father and when their Mother came to be discover'd they ought to have bin Subjects to  Amulius  or  Numitor  They could not be his Heirs whilst he liv'd and were not when he died The Government of the  Latins  continu'd at  Alba  and  Romulus  reign'd over those who join'd with him in building  Rome  The Power not coming to him by Inheritance must have bin gain'd by Force or confer'd upon him by Consent It could not be acquir'd by Force for one Man could not force a multitude of fierce and valiant men as they appear to have bin It must therefore have bin by Consent And when he aim'd at more Authority than they were willing to allow they slew him He being dead they fetch'd  Numa  from among the  Sabines  He was not their Father nor Heir to their Father but a Stranger not a Conqueror but an unarm'd Philosopher  Tullus Hostilius  had no other Title  Ancus Martius  was no way related to such as had reign'd The first  Tarquin  was the Son of a banish'd  Corinthian Servius Tullus  came to  Rome  in the belly of his captive Mother and could inherit nothing but Chains from his vanquish'd Father  Tarquin  the Proud murder'd him and first took upon himself the Title of King  sine jussu Populi  If this  T Liv  Murder and Usurpation be call'd a Conquest and thought to create a Right the effect will be but small The Conqueror was soon conquer'd banish'd and his Sons slain after which we hear no more of him or his Descendents Whatsoever he gain'd from  Servius  or the People was  soon lost and did accrue to those that conquer'd and ejected him and they might retain what was their own or confer it upon one or more in such manner and measure as best pleas'd themselves If the Regal Power which our Author says was in the Consuls could be divided into two parts limited to a Year and suffer such restrictions as the People pleas'd to lay upon it they might have divided it into as many parcels and put it into such form as best suted with their Inclinations and the several Magistracys which they did create for the exercise of the Kingly and all other Powers shews they were to give account to none but themselves  The  Israelites Spartans Romans  and others who thus fram'd their Governments according to their own Will did it not by any peculiar Priviledg but by a universal Right confer'd upon them by God and Nature They were made of no better Clay than others They had no Right that dos not as well belong to other Nations that is to say The Constition of every Government is refer'd to those who are concern'd in it and no other has any thing to do with it  Yet if it be asserted that the Goverment of  Rome  was Paternal or they had none at all I desire to know how they came to have six Fathers of several Familys whilst they liv'd under Kings and two or more new ones every Year afterwards Or how they came to be so excellent in Vertue and Fortune as to conquer the best part of the World if they had no Government  Hobbs  indeed dos scurrilously deride  Cicero Plato  and  Aristotle Caeteros{que} Romanae Graecae Anarchiae fautores  But 'tis strange that this Anarchy which he resembles to a Chaos full of darkness and confusion that can have no Strength or regular Action should overthrow all the Monarchys that came within their reach  If  as our Authors says  the best order greatest strength and most stability be in them  It must therefore be confest that these Governments are in their various Forms rightly instituted by several Nations without any regard to Inheritance or that these Nations have had no Governments and were more strong vertuous and happy without Government than under it which is most absurd  But if Governments arise from the Consent of Men and are instituted by Men according to their own Inclinations they do therein seek their own Good for the Will is ever drawn by some real Good or the appearance of it This is that which man seeks by all the regular or irregular motions of his mind Reason and Passion Vertue and Vice do herein concur tho they differ vastly in the Objects in which each of 'em thinks this Good to consist A People therefore that sets up Kings Dictators Consuls Pretors or Emperors dos it not that they may be great glorious rich or happy but that it may be well with themselves and their Posterity This is not accomplish'd simply by setting one a few or more men in the administration of Powers but by placing the Authority in those who may rightly perform their Office This is not every man's Work Valour Integrity Wisdom Industry Experience and Skill are requir'd for the management of those Military and Civil Affairs that necessarily fall under the care of the chief Magistrats He or they therefore may reasonably be advanc'd above their Equals who are most fit to perform the Dutys belonging to their Stations in order to the publick Good for which they were instituted  Marius Sylla Catiline Julius  or  Octavius Caesar  and all those who by force or fraud usurp'd a Dominion over their Brethren could have no Title to this Right much less could they become Fathers of the People  by using all the most wicked means that could well be imagin'd to destroy them and not being regularly chosen for their Vertues or the opinion of them nor prefer'd on account of any Prerogative that had bin from the beginning annex'd to their Familys they could have no other Right than Occupation could confer upon them If this can confer a Right there is an end of all Disputes concerning the Laws of God or Man If  Julius  and  Octavius Caesar  did successively become Lords and Fathers of their Country by slaughtering almost all the Senat and such Persons as were eminent for Nobility or Vertue together with the greater part of the People it cannot be denied that a Thief who breaks into his Neighbour's House and kills him is justly Master of his Estate and may exact the same obedience from his Children that they render'd to their Father If this Right could be transfer'd to  Tiberius  either thro the malice of  Octavius  or the fraud of his Wife a wet Blanket laid over his face and a few corrupted Soldiers could invest  Caligula  with the same A vile Rascal pulling  Claudius  out by the heels from behind the Hangings where he had hid himself could give it to him A dish of Mushrooms well season'd by the infamous Strumpet his Wife and a Potion prepar'd for  Britannicus  by  Locusta  could transfer it to her Son who was a stranger to his Blood  Galba  became Heir to it by driving  Nero  to despair and death Two common Soldiers by exciting his Guards to kill him could give a just Tittle to the Empire of the World to  Otho  who was thought to be the worst man in it If a Company of Villains in the  German  Army thinking it as fit for them as others to create a Father of Mankind could conser the Dignity upon  Vitellius  and if  Vespasian  causing him to be kill'd and thrown into a Jakes less impure than his Life did inherit all the glorious and sacred Privileges belonging to that Title 'tis in vain to inquire after any man's right to any thing  But if there be such a thing as Right or Wrong to be examin'd by men and any Rules set whereby the one may be distinguish'd from the other these Extravagancys can have no effect of Right Such as commit 'em are not to be look'd upon as Fathers but as the most mortal Enemys of their respective Countrys No Right is to be acknowledg'd in any but such as is confer'd upon them by those who have the right of conferring and are concern'd in the exercise of the Power upon such conditions as best please themselves No Obedience can be due to him or them who have not a right of commanding which cannot reasonably be confer'd upon any that are not esteem'd willing and able rightly to execute it This ability to perform the highest Works that come within the reach of Men and integrity of Will not to be diverted from it by any temptation or consideration of privat Advantages comprehending all that is most commendable in Man we may easily see that whensoever men act according to the Law of their own Nature which is Reason they can have no other rule to direct them in advancing one above another than the opinion of a man's Vertue and Ability best to perform the Duty incumbent upon him that is by all means to procure the good of the People committed to his charge He is only fit to conduct a Ship who understands the Art of a Pilot When we are sick we seek the assistance of such as are best skill'd in Physick The Command of an Army is prudently confer'd upon him that has most Industry Skill Experience and Valour In like manner He only can according to the rules of Nature be advanc'd to the Dignitys of the World who excels in the Vertues requir'd for the performance of the Dutys annex'd to them  for he only can answer the end of his Institution The Law of every i  stituted Power is to accomplish the end of its Institution as Creature are to do the Will of their Creator and in deflecting from it overthro  their own being Magistrats are distinguish'd from other men by th Power with which the Law invests them for the publick Good He tha cannot or will not procure that Good destroys his own being and becomes like to other men In matters of the greatest importance  Detu+digniori  is the Voice of Nature all her most sacred Laws are perverted if this be not observ'd in the disposition of Governments and all ar  neglected and violated if they are not put into the hands of such as exce in all manner of Vertues for they only are worthy of them and they only can have a right who are worthy because they only can perform th  end for which they are instituted This may seem strange to those wh  have their heads infected with  Filmer  's whimsys but to others so certainly grounded upon Truth that  La razon es porque siempre se ha de tener respeto al fin y causa final por el qual el tal supremo y universal Sennor se les pone que es su bien y utilitad y a que no se le conv  erte el tal supremo Sennorio in danno pernicie y destruycion Porque si assi fuesse no ay que dudar que non desde entonces inclusivamente ser  a injusto Tyrannico y iniquo tal Sennorio come mas se enderezasse al proprio interesse y provecho del Sennor que al bien y utilitad comun de los Subditos lo qual de la razon natural y de todas las Leyes humanas y divinas es abhorrecido y abhorrescible  Bar de las Casas destr de las Indias pag  Bartolomeo de las Casas  Bishop o  Chiapa  in a Treatise written by him and dedicated to the Empero  Charles  V concerning the  Indies  makes it the foundation of all his Discourse That notwithstanding his grant of all those Countrys from the Pope and his pretensions to Conquest he could have no right over any of those Nations unless he did in the first place as the principal end regard their Good  The reason  says he  is that regard is to be had to the principal End and Cause for which a supreme or universal Lord is set over them which is their good and profit and not that it should turn to their destruction and ruin for if that should be there is no doubt but from thence forward that Power would be tyrannical and unjust as tending more to the interest and profit of that Lord than to the publick good and profit of the Subjects which according to natural Reason and the Laws of God and Man is abhor'd and deserves to be abhor'd  And in another place speaking of the Governors who abusing their Power brought many troubles and vexations upon the Indians he says  El yugo y governacion de Vuestra Magestad importable Tirannico y degno de todo abhorrecimiento Pag  They had rendred his Majesty's Government intolerable and his Yoke insupportable tyrannical and most justly abhor'd  I do not alledg this thro an opinion that a  Spanish  Bishop is of more Authority than another man but to shew that these are common Notions agreed by all Mankind and that the greatest Monarchs do neither refuse to hear them or to regulate themselves according to them till they renounce common sense and degenerate into Beasts  But if that Government be unreasonable and abhor'd by the Laws of God and Man which is not instituted for the good of those who live under it and an Empire grounded upon the Donation of the Pope which amongst those of the  Roman  Religion is of great importance and an intire conquest of the People with whom there had bin no former Compact do degenerate into a most unjust and detestable Tyranny so soon as the Supreme Lord begins to prefer his own interest or profit before the good of his Subjects What shall we say of those who pretend to a right  of Dominion over free Nations as inseparably united to their Persons without distinction of Age or Sex or the least consideration of their Infirmitys and Vices as if they were not plac'd in the Throne for the good of their People but to enjoy the Honours and Pleasures that attend the highest Fortune What name can be fit for those who have no other Title to the Places they possess than the most unjust and violent Usurpation or being descended from those who for their Vertues were by the Peoples consent duly advanc'd to the exercise of a legitimate Power and having sworn to administer it according to the Conditions upon which it was given for the good of those who gave it turn all to their own Pleasure and Profit without any care of the Publick These may be liable to hard Censures but those who use them most gently must confess that such an extreme deviation from the end of their Institution annuls it and the Wound thereby given to the natural and original Rights of those Nations cannot be cur'd unless they resume the Libertys of which they have bin depriv'd and return to the antient Custom of chusing those to be Magistrats who for their Vertues best deserve to be prefer'd before their Brethren and are endow'd with those Qualitys that best enable men to perform the great end of providing for the publick Safety  SECT XVII God having given the Government of the World to no one Man nor declar'd how it should be divided left it to the VVill of Man  OUR Author's next Inquiry is  What becomes of the Right of Fatherhood in case the Crown should escheat for want of an Heir Whether it doth not escheat to the People  His answer is  'Tis but the negligence or ignorance of the People to lose the knowledg of the true Heir c  And a little below  The Power is not devolv'd to the Multitude No the Kingly Power escheats on independent Heads of Familys All such prime Heads have Power to consent in the uniting or conferring their Fatherly Right of Sovereign Authority on whom they please and he that is so elected claims not his Power as a Donative from the People but as being substituted by God from whom he receives his Royal Charter of Universal Father c  In my opinion before he had ask'd What should be done in case the Crown should escheat for want of an Heir he ought to have prov'd there had bin a Man in the world who had the Right in himself and telling who he was have shew'd how it had bin transmitted for some Generations that we might know where to seek his Heir and before he accus'd the Multitude of ignorance or negligence in not knowing this Heir he ought to have inform'd us how it may be possible to know him or what it would avail us if we did know him for 'tis in vain to know to whom a Right belongs that never was and never can be executed But we may go farther and affirm that as the Universal Right must have bin in  Noah  and  Shem  if in any who never exercis'd it we have reason to believe there never was any such thing And having prov'd from Scripture and Human History That the first Kingdoms were set up in a direct opposition to this Right by  Nimrod  and others he that should seek and find their Heirs would only find those who by a most accursed Wickedness had usurp'd and continu'd a Dominion over their Fathers  contrary to the Laws of God and Nature and we should neither be more wise nor more happy than we are tho our Author should furnish us with certain and authentick Genealogys by which we might know the true Heirs of  Nimrod  and the seventy two Kings that went from  Babylon  who as he supposes gave beginning to all the Kingdoms of the Earth  Moreover if the Right be Universal it must be in one for the World being butone the whole Right of commanding it cannot at the same time be in many and proceed from the Ordinance of God or of Man It cannot proceed from the Ordinance of God for he dos nothing in vain He never gave a Right that could not be executed No man can govern that which he dos not so much as know No man did ever know all the World no man therefore did or could govern it and none could be appointed by God to do that which is absolutely impossible to be done for it could not consist with his Wisdom We find this in our selves It were a shame for one of us poor weak shortsighted Creatures in the disposal of our Affairs to appoint such a method as were utterly ineffectual for the Preservation of our Familys or destructive to them and the blasphemy of imputing to God such an Ordinance as would be a reproach to one of us can sute only with the wicked and impudent Fury of such as our Author who delights in Monsters This also shews us that it cannot be from Men One or a few may commit Follys but Mankind dos not universally commit and perpetually persist in any They cannot therefore by a general and permanent Authority enact that which is utterly absurd and impossible or if they do they destroy their own Nature and can no longer deserve the Name of reasonable Creatures There can be therefore no such man and the Folly of seeking him or his Heir that never was may be left to the Disciples of  Filmer  The Difficultys are as great if it be said The World might be divided into parcels and we are to seek the Heirs of the first Possessors for besides that no man can be oblig'd to seek that which cannot be found all men knowing that  Caliginosa nocte haec premit Deus  and that the Genealogys of Mankind are so confus'd that unless possibly among the  Jews  we have reason to believe there is not a man in the world who knows his own Original it could be of no advantage to us tho we knew that of every one for the Division would be of no value unless it were at the first rightly made by him who had all the Authority in himself which dos no where appear and rightly deduc'd to him who according to that division claims a right to the Parcel he enjoys And I fear our Author would terribly shake the Crowns in which the Nations of  Europe  are concern'd if they should be persuaded to search into the Genealogys of their Princes and to judg of their Rights according to the proofs they should give of Titles rightly deduc'd by succession of Blood from the seventy two first Kings from whom our Author fancys all the Kingdoms of the World to be deriv'd  Besides tho this were done it would be to no purpose for the seventy two were not sent out by  Noah  nor was he or his Sons of that number but they went or were sent from  Babylon  where  Nimrod  reign'd who as has bin already prov'd neither had nor could have any right at all but was a mighty Hunter even a proud and cruel Tyrant usurping a Power to which he had no right and which was perpetually exercis'd by him and his Successors against God and his People From whence I may safely conclude That no right can ever be deriv'd and may justly presume  it will be denied by none who are of better Morals and of more sound Principles in matters of Law and Religion than  Filmer  and  Heylin  since 'tis no less absurd to deduce a right from him that had none than to expect pure and wholesom Waters from a filthy polluted and poisonous Fountain  If it be pretended that some other man since  Noah  had this universal Right it must either remain in one single person as his right Heir or be divided If in one I desire to know who he is and where we may find him that the Empire of the World may be deliver'd to him But if he cannot be found the business is at an end for every man in the World may pretend himself to be the person and the infinite controversys arising thereupon can never be decided unless either the Genealogys of every one from  Noah  were extant and prov'd or we had a Word from Heaven with a sufficient testimony of his mission who announces it When this is done 'twill be time to consider what kind of obedience is due to this wonderfully happy and glorious Person But whilst the first appears to be absolutely impossible and we have no promise or reason to expect the other the Proposition is to be esteem'd one of our Author's empty whimsys which cannot be receiv'd by mankind unless they come all to be possest with an Epidemical madness which would cast them into that which  Hobbs  calls  Bellum omnium contra omnes  when every man's Sword would be drawn against every man if God should so abandon the World to suffer them to fall into such misery  If this pretended Right be divided it concerns us to know by whom when how and to whom for the division cannot be of any value unless the Right was originally in one that he did exercise this Right in making the division that the parcels into which the World is divided are according to the allotment made and that the Persons claiming them by virtue of it are the true Heirs of those to whom they were first granted Many other difficultys may be alledg'd no less inextricable than these but this seeming sufficient for the present I shall not trouble my self with more promising that when they shall be remov'd I will propose others or confessing my errors yield up the cause  But if the Dominion of the whole World cannot belong to any one man and every one has an equal title to that which should give it or if it did belong to one none did ever exercise it in governing the whole or dividing it or if he did divide it no man knows how when and to whom so that they who lay claim to any parcels can give no testimony of that division nor shew any better title than other men deriv'd from his first Progenitor to whom 'tis said to have bin granted and that we have neither a Word nor the promise of a Word from God to decide the controversys arising thereupon nor any Prophet giving testimony of his mission that takes upon him to do it the whole Fabrick of our Author's Patriarchical Dominion falls to the ground and they who propose these Doctrins which if they were receiv'd would be a root of perpetual and reconcilable hatred in every man against every man can be accounted no less than Ministers of the Devil tho they want the abilitys he has sometimes infus'd into those who have bin imploy'd upon the like occasions And we may justly conclude that God having never given the whole World to be govern'd by one man nor prescrib'd any rule for the division of it nor declar'd where the right of dividing or subdividing that which every man has should terminate we may safely affirm that the whole is for ever left to the will and discretion of Man We may enter into form  and continue in greater or lesser Societys as best pleases our selves The right of Paternity as to Dominion is at an end and no more remains but the love veneration and obedience which proceeding from a due sense of the benefits of Birth and Education have their root in Gratitude and are esteem'd sacred and inviolable by all that are sober and vertuous And as 'tis impossible to transfer these Benefits by inheritance so 'tis impossible to transfer the Rights arising from them No man can be my Father but he that did beget me and 'tis as absurd to say I owe that Duty to one who is not my Father which I owe to my Father as to say he did beget me who did not beget me for the obligation that arises from benefits can only be to him that confer'd them 'Tis in vain to say the same is due to his Heir for that can take place only when he has but one which in this case signifies nothing For if I being the only Son of my Father inherit his Right and have the same power over my Children as he had over me if I had one hundred Brothers they must all inherit the same and the Law of  England  which acknowledges one only Heir is not general but municipal and is so far from being general as the precept of God and Nature that I doubt whether it was ever known or us'd in any Nation of the World beyond our Island The words of the Apostle  If we are Children we are therefore Heirs and Coheirs with Christ  are the voice of God and Nature and as the universal Law of God and Nature is always the same every one of us who have Children have the same Right over them as  Abraham Isaac  and  Jacob  had over theirs and that Right which was not devolv'd to any one of them but inherited by them all I mean the right of Father as Father not the peculiar promises which were not according to the Law of Nature but the election of Grace is also inherited by every one of us and ours that is by all Mankind But if that which could be inherited was inherited by all and it be impossible that a right of Dominion over all can be due to every one then all that is or can be inherited by every one is that exemption from the Dominion of another which we call Liberty and is the gift of God and Nature  SECT XVIII If a right of Dominion were esteem'd Hereditary according to the Law of Nature a multitude of destructive and inextricable Controversys would thereupon arise  THere being no such thing therefore according to the Law of Nature as an Hereditary Right to the Dominion of the World or any part of it nor any one man that can derive to himself a title from the first Fathers of Mankind by which he can rightly pretend to be prefer'd before others to that command or a part of it and none can be deriv'd from  Nimrod  or other Usurpers who had none in themselves we may justly spare our pains of seeking farther into this matter But as things of the highest importance can never be too fully explain'd it may not be amiss to observe That if Mankind could be brought to believe that such a right of Dominion were by the Law of God and Nature hereditary a great number of the most destructive and inextricable Controversys must thereupon arise which the wisdom and goodness of God can  never enjoin and Nature which is Reason can never intend but at present I shall only mention two from whence others must perpetually spring First if there be such a Law no Human Constitution can alter it no length of time can be a defence against it All Governments that are not conformable to it are vicious and void even in their root and must be so for ever That which is originally unjust may be justly overthrown We do not know of any at least in that part of the World in which we are most concern'd that is establish'd or exercis'd with an absolute Power as by the Authors of those opinions is esteem'd inseparable from it Many as the Empire and other States are directly contrary and on that account can have no Justice in them It being certain therefore that he or they who exercise those Governments have no right that there is a Man to whom it dos belong and no man knowing who he is there is no one man who has not as good a title to it as any other There is not therefore one who has not a right as well as any to overthrow that which has none at all He that has no part in the Government may destroy it as well as he that has the greatest for he neither has that which God ordain'd he should have nor can shew a title to that which he enjoys from that original Prerogative of Birth from whence it can only be deriv'd  If it be said that some Governments are arbitrary as they ought to be and  France Turkey  and the like be alledg'd as instances the matter is not mended for we do not only know when those who deserve to be regarded by us were not absolute and how they came to be so but also that those very Familys which are now in possession are not of very long continuance had no more title to the original right we speak of than any other men and consequently can have none to this day And tho we cannot perhaps say that the Governments of the barbarous Eastern Nations were ever other than they are yet the known Original of them deprives them of all pretence to the Patriarchical Inheritance and they may be as justly as any other depriv'd of the Power to which they have no title  In the second place tho all mens Genealogys were extant and fully verifi'd and it were allow'd that the Dominion of the World or every part of it did belong to the right Heir of the first Progenitor or any other to whom the first did rightly assign the Parcel which is under question yet it were impossible for us to know who should be esteem'd the true Heir or according to what rule he should be judg'd so to be for God has not by a precise word determin'd it and Men cannot agree about it as appears by the various Laws and Customs of several Nations disposing severally of Hereditary Dominions  'Tis a folly to say they ought to go to the next in blood for 'tis not known who is that next Some give the preference to him who amongst many Competitors is the fewest degrees remov'd from their common Progenitor who first obtain'd the Crown Others look only upon the last that possest it Some admit of Representation by which means the Grandchild of a King by his eldest Son is prefer'd before his second Son he being said to represent his dead Father who was the eldest Others exclude these and advance the younger Son who is nearer by one degree to the common Progenitor that last enjoy'd the Crown than the Grandchild According to the first rule  Richard  II was advanc'd to the Crown of  England  as Son of the eldest Son of  Edward  III before his Uncles who by one degree were nearer to the last Possessor And in pursuance of the second  Sancho  sirnam'd the Brave second Son of  Alphonso  the Wise  King of  Castile  was prefer'd before  Alphonso  Son of  Ferdinand  his eldest Brother according to the Law of  Thanestry  which was in force in  Spain  ever since we have had any knowledg of that Country as appears by the contest between  Corbis  and  Orsua  decided by Combat before  Scipio Africanus  continu'd in full force as long as the Kingdom of the  Goths  lasted and was ever highly valu'd till the House of  Austria  got possession of that Country and introduc'd Laws and Customs formerly unknown to the Inhabitants  The Historys of all Nations furnish us with innumerable Examples of both sorts and whosoever takes upon him to determin which side is in the right ought to shew by what authority he undertakes to be the Judg of Mankind and how the infinite breaches thereby made upon the rights of the governing Familys shall be cur'd without the overthrow of those that he shall condemn and of the Nations where such Laws have bin in force as he dislikes and till that be done in my opinion no place will afford a better lodging for him that shall impudently assume such a Power than the new buildings in  MoorFields  'Tis no less hard to decide whether this next Heir is to be sought in the Male Line only or whether Females also may be admitted If we follow the first as the Law of God and Nature the title of our  English  Kings is wholly abolish'd for not one of them since  Henry  the  st  has had the least pretence to an inheritance by the Masculine Line and if it were necessary we have enough to say of those that were before him  If it be said that the same Right belongs to Females it ought to be prov'd that Women are as fit as Men to perform the Office of a King that is as the  Israelites  said to  Samuel  to go in and out before us to judg us and to fight our Battels for it were an impious folly to say that God had ordain'd those for the Offices on which the good of Mankind so much depends who by nature are unable to perform the dutys of them If on the other side the sweetness gentleness delicacy and tenderness of the Sex render them so unfit for manly exercises that they are accounted utterly repugnant to and inconsistent with that modesty which dos so eminently shine in all those that are good amongst them that Law of Nature which should advance them to the Government of Men would overthrow its own Work and make those to be the Heads of Nations which cannot be the Heads of privat Familys for as the Apostle says  The Woman is not the head of the Man but the Man is the head of the Women  This were no less than to oblige Mankind to lay aside the name of reasonable Creature for if Reason be his Nature it cannot enjoin that which is contrary to it self if it be not the definition  Homo est animal rationale  is false and ought no longer to be assum'd  If any man think these Arguments to be mistaken or misappli'd I desire him to enquire of the  French  Nation on what account they have always excluded Females and such as descended from them How comes the House of  Bourbon  to be advanc'd to the Throne before a great Number of Familys that come from the Daughters of the House of  Valois  Or what title those could have before the Daughters of the other Lines descended from  Hugh Capet Pepin Meroveus  or  Pharamond  I know not how such questions would be receiv'd but I am inclin'd to think that the wickedness and folly of those who should thereby endeavour to overthrow the most antient and most venerated Constitutions of the greatest Nations and by that means to involve them in the most inextricable difficultys would be requited only with Stones  It cannot be denied that the most valiant wise learned and best po+lish'd Nations have always follow'd the same Rule tho the  Reginarum{que} sub armis  Barbaries pars magna jacet  Lucan P  ar    weak and bar  arous acted otherwise and no man ever heard of a Queen or a man deriving his title from a Female among the antient civiliz'd Nations But if this be not enough the Law of God that wholly omits Females is sufficient to shew that Nature which is his Handmaid cannot advance them When God describes who should be the King of his People if they would have one and how he should govern no mention is made  Deut  of Daughters The  Israelites  offer'd the Kingdom to  Gideon  and to his Sons God promis'd and gave it to  Saul David Jeroboam Jehu  and their Sons When all of them save  David  by their Crimes fell from the Kingdom the Males only were extirpated and the Females who had no part in the Promises did not fall under the Penaltys or the Vengeance that was executed upon those Familys and we do not in the Word of God or in the History of the  Jews  hear of any Feminin Reign except that which was usurp'd by  Athaliah  nor that any consideration was had of their Descendents in relation to the Kingdom which is enough to shew that it is not according to the Law of God nor to the Law of Nature which cannot differ from it So that Females or such as derive their right by inheritance from Females must have it from some other Law or they can have none at all  But tho this question were authentically decided and concluded that Females might or might not succeed we should not be at the end of our contests for if they were excluded it would not from thence follow as in  France  that their Descendents should be so also for the Privilege which is denied to them because they cannot without receding from the modesty and gentleness of the Sex take upon them to execute all the Dutys requir'd may be transfer'd to their Children as  Henry  the second and  Henry  the seventh were admitted tho their Mothers were rejected  If it be said that every Nation ought in this to follow their own Constitutions we are at an end of our Controversys for they ought not to be follow'd unless they are rightly made They cannot be rightly made if they are contrary to the universal Law of God and Nature If there be a general Rule 'tis impossible but some of them being directly contrary to each other must be contrary to it If therefore all of them are to be follow'd there can be no general Law given to all but every People is by God and Nature left to the liberty of regulating these matters relating to themselves according to their own prudence or convenience and this seems to be so certainly true that whosoever dos as our Author propose Doctrins to the contrary must either be thought rashly to utter that which he dos not understand or maliciously to cast balls of Division among all Nations whereby every man's Sword would be drawn against every man to the total subversion of all Order and Government  SECT XIX Kings cannot confer the right of Father upon Princes nor Princes upon Kings  LEST what has bin said before by our Author should not be sufficient to accomplish his design of bringing confusion upon Mankind and some may yet lie still for want of knowing at whose command he should cut his Brother's throat if he has not power or courage to set up a title for himself he has a new project that would certainly do his work if it were receiv'd Not content with the absurditys and untruths already utter'd in giving the incommunicable right of Fathers not only to those who as is manifestly testify'd by sacred and profane Historys did usurp a power over their Fathers or such as ow'd no manner of obedience to them and justifying those Usurpations which are most odious to God and all good men he now fancys a Kingdom so gotten may escheat for want of an Heir whereas there is no need of seeking any if Usurpation can confer a Right and that he who gets the Power into his hands ought to be reputed the right Heir of the first Progenitor for such a one will seldom be wanting if violence and fraud be justified by the command of God and Nations stand oblig'd to render obedience till a stronger or more successful Villain throws him from the Throne he had invaded But if it should come to pass that no man would step into the vacant place he has a new way of depriving the People of their Right to provide for the Government of themselves  Because  says he  the dependency of antient Familys is oft obscure and worn out of knowledg therefore the Wisdom of all or most Princes has thought fit many times to adopt those for Heads of Familys and Princes of Provinces whose merits abilitys or fortunes have ennobled them and made them fit and capable of such Royal Favours All such prime Heads and Fathers have power to consent to the uniting and conferring of their fatherly Right and Sovereignty on whom they please  c  I may justly ask how any one or more Familys come to be esteem'd more antient than others if all are descended from one common Father as the Scriptures testify or to what purpose it were to inquire what Familys were the most antient if there were any such when the youngest and most mean by usurpation gets an absolute right of Dominion over the eldest tho his own Progenitors as  Nimrod  did but I may certainly conclude That whatever the Right be that belongs to those antient Familys it is inherent in them and cannot be confer'd on any other by any human Power for it proceeds from Nature only The Duty I owe to my Father dos not arise from an usurp'd or delegated Power but from my birth deriv'd from him and 'tis as impossible for any man to usurp or receive by the grant of another the right of a Father over me as for him to become or pretend to be made my Father by another who did not beget me But if he say true this right of Father dos not arise from Nature nor the obedience that I owe to him that begot me from the benefits which I receiv'd but is merely an artificial thing depending upon the Will of another and that we may be sure there can be no error in this our Author attributes it to the wisdom of Princes But before this  comes to be authentick we must at the least be sure that all Princes have this great and profound Wisdom which our Author acknowledges to be in them and which is certainly necessary for the doing of such great things if they were refer'd to them They seem to us to be born like other men and to be generally no wiser than other men We are not oblig'd to believe that  Nebuchadnezzar  was wise till God had given him the heart of a man or that his Grandson  Belshazzar  who being laid in the balance was found too light had any such profound Wisdom  Ahasuerus  shew'd it not in appointing all the People of God to be slain upon a Lie told to him by a Rascal and the matter was not very much mended when being inform'd of the truth he gave 'em leave to kill as many of their Enemys as they pleas'd The hardness of  Pharaoh  's heart and the overthrow thereby brought upon himself and People dos not argue so profound a Judgment as our Author presumes every Prince must have And 'tis not probable that  Samuel  would have told  Saul He had done foolishly  if Kings had always bin so exceeding wise Nay if Wisdom had bin annex'd to the Character  Solomon  might have spar'd the pains of asking it from God and  Rehoboam  must have had it Not to multiply examples out of Scripture 'tis believ'd that  Xerxes  had not inflicted Stripes upon the Sea for breaking his Navy in pieces if he had bin so very wise  Caligula  for the same reason might have sav'd the labour of making love to the Moon or have chosen a fitter Subject to advance to the Consulat than his Horse  Incitatus Nero  had not endeavour'd to make a Woman of  Sueton  a Man nor married a Man as a Woman Many other Examples might be alledg'd to shew that Kings are not always wise and not only the  Roman  Satyrist who says  Quicquid delirant Reges  c shews that he did  Horat  not believe them to be generally wiser than other men but  Solomon  himself judges them to be as liable to infirmitys when he prefers a wise Child before an old and foolish King If therefore the strength of our Author's Argument lies in the certainty of the Wisdom of Kings it can be of no value till he proves it to be more universal in them than History or Experience will permit us to believe Nay if there be Truth or Wisdom in the Scripture which frequently represents the wicked Man as a Fool we cannot think that all Kings are wise unless it be prov'd that none of them have bin wicked and when this is perform'd by  Filmer  's Disciples I shall confess my error  Men give testimony of their Wisdom when they undertake that which they ought to do and rightly perform that which they undertake both which points do utterly fail in the subject of our Discourse We have often heard of such as have adopted those to be their Sons who were not so and some Civil Laws approve it This signifies no more than that such a Man either thro affection to one who is not his Son or to his Parents▪ or for some other reason takes him into his Family and shews kindness to him as to his Son but the adoption of Fathers is a whimsical piece of nonsense If this be capable of an aggravation I think none can be greater than not to leave it to my own discretion who having no Father may resolve to pay the Duty I ow'd to my Father to one who may have shew'd Kindness to me but for another to impose a Father upon a Man or a People compos'd of Fathers or such as have Fathers whereby they should be depriv'd of that natural Honour and Right which he makes the foundation of his Discourse is the utmost of all absurditys If any Prince therefore has ever undertaken to appoint Fathers of his People he cannot be accounted a man of profound Wisdom but a Fool or a  Madman and his Acts can be of no value But if the thing were consonant to Nature and refer'd to the Will of Princes which I absolutely deny the frequent Extravagancys committed by them in the elevation of their Favorites shews that they intend not to make them Fathers of the People or know not what they do when they do it  To chuse or institute a Father is nonsense in the very term but if any were to be chosen to perform the Office of Fathers to such as have none and are not of age to provide for themselves as men do Tutors or Guardians for Orphans none could be capable of being elected but such as in kindness to the person they were to take under their care did most resemble his true Father and had the virtues and abilitys requir'd rightly to provide for his good If this fails all Right ceases and such a corruption is introduc'd as we saw in our Court of Wards which the Nation could not bear when the Institution was perverted and the King who ought to have taken a tender care of the Wards and their Estates deliver'd 'em as a prey to those whom he favour'd  Our Author ridiculously attributes the Title and Authority of Father to the word  Prince  for it has none in it and signifies no more than a Man who in some kind is more eminent than the Vulgar In this sense  Trecenti Romanae juventutis Principes  T Liv  Mutius Scaevola  told  Porsenna  that  Three hundred Princes of the  Roman  Youth had conspir'd against him  By which he could not mean that three hundred Fathers of the  Roman  Youth but three hundred  Roman  young men had conspir'd and they could not be Fathers of the City unless they had bin Fathers of their own Fathers  Princeps Senatus  was understood in the same sense and  T Sempronius  the Censor chusing  Q Fabius  T Liv  l  Maximus  to that Honour gave for a reason  Se lecturum Q Fabium Maximum quem tum Principem Romanae Civitatis esse vel Annibale judice dicturus esset  which could not be understood that  Hannibal  thought him to be the Father or Lord of the City for he knew he was not but the Man who for Wisdom and Valour was the most eminent in it  The like are and ought to be the Princes of every Nation and tho something of Honour may justly be attributed to the Descendents of such as have done great Services to their Country yet they who degenerate from them cannot be esteem'd Princes much less can such Honours or Rights be confer'd upon Courtcreatures or Favorites  Tiberius Caligula Claudius Nero Galba  and others could advance  Macro Pallas Narcissus Tigellinus Vinnius Laco  and the like to the highest degrees of Riches and Power but they still continu'd to be Villains and so they died  No wise or good Man ever thought otherwise of those who thro the folly of Princes have bin advanc'd to the highest places in several Countrys The madness of attributing to them a paternal power seems to have bin peculiarly reserv'd to compleat the insamy of our Author for he only could acknowledg a cooptitious Father or give to another man the power of chusing him I confess that a man in his infancy may have bin expos'd like  Moses Cyrus Oedipus Romulus  He may have bin taken in War or by the charity of some good person sav'd from the teeth of wild Beasts or from the Sword by which his Parents fell and may have bin educated with that care which Fathers usually have of their Children 'tis reasonable that such a one in the whole course of his life should pay that veneration and obedience to him who gave him as it were a second birth which was due to his natural Father and this tho improperly  may be call'd an Adoption But to think that any man can assume it to himself or confer it upon another and thereby arrogate to himself the service and obedience which by the most tender and sacred Laws of Nature we owe to those from whom we receive Birth and Education is the most preposterous folly that hitherto has ever enter'd into the heart of man  Our Author nevertheless is not asham'd of it and gives Reasons no way unsutable to the Proposition  Men are  says he  adopted Fathers of Provinces for their Abilitys Merits or Fortunes  But these Abilitys can simply deserve nothing for it they are ill employ'd they are the worst of Vices and the most powerful Instruments of Mischief Merits in regard of another are nothing unless they be to him and he alone can merit from me the respect due to a Father who has confer'd Benefits upon me in some measure proportionable to those which we usually receive from our Fathers and the world may judg whether all the CourtMinisters and Favorites that we have known do upon this account deserve to be esteem'd Fathers of Nations But to allow this on account of their Fortunes is if possible more extravagant than any thing that has bin yet utter'd By this account  Mazarin  must have bin Father of the  French  Nation The same Right was inherited by his chast Niece and remain'd in her till she and her silly Husband dissipated the Treasures which her Uncle had torn from the Bowels of that People The Partizans may generally claim the same Right over the Provinces they have pillag'd  Old Audley Dog Smith  Bp  Duppa Brownloe Child Dashwood Fox  c are to be esteem'd Fathers of the People of  England  This Doctrin is perfectly Canonical if  Filmer  and  Heylin  were good Divines and Legal if they judg'd more rightly touching matters of Law But if it be absurd and detestable they are to be reputed Men who by attributing the highest Honours to the vilest Wretches of the world for what they had gain'd by the most abominable means endeavour to encrease those Vices which are already come to such a height that they can by no other way be brought to a greater Daily experience too plainly shews with what rage Avarice usually fills the hearts of men There are not many destructive Villanys committed in the World that do not proceed from it In this respect 'tis call'd  Idolatry  and  the root of all evil Solomon  warns us to beware of such as make hast to grow rich and says they shall not be innocent But 'tis no matter what the Prophets the Apostles or the wisest of men say of Riches and the ways of gaining them for our Author tells us that men of the greatest Fortunes without examining how they came to them or what use they make of them deserve to be made Fathers of Provinces  But this is not his only quarrel with all that is just and good His whole Book goes directly against the letter and spirit of the Scripture The work of all those whom God in several Ages has rais'd up to announce his Word was to abate the Lusts and Passions that arise in the hearts of men to shew the vanity of worldly Enjoyments with the dangers that accompany Riches and Honors and to raise our hearts to the love of those Treasures that perish not Honest and wise men following the Light of Nature have in some measure imitated this Such as liv'd private lives as  Plato Socrates Epictetus  and others made it their business to abate mens Lusts by shewing the folly of seeking vain Honors useless Riches or unsatissying Pleasures and those who were like to them if they were rais'd to supreme Magistracys have endeavour'd by the severest Punishments  to restrain men from commiting the Crimes by which Riches are most commonly gain'd but  Filmer  and  Heylin  lead us into a new way If they deserve credit whosoever would become supreme Lord and Father of his Country absolute sacred and inviolable is only to kill him that is in the head of the Government Usurpation confers an equal Right with Election or Inheritance We are to look upon the Power not the Ways by which it is obtain'd Possession only is to be regarded and men must venerate the present Power as set up by God tho gain'd by Violence Treachery or Poison Children must not impose Laws upon nor examin the Actions of their Father Those who are a little more modest and would content themselves with the Honour of being Fathers and Lords only of Provinces if they get Riches by the savour of the King or the favour of the King by Riches may receive that honour from him The Lord Paramount may make them peculiar Lords of each Province as sacred as himself and by that means every man shall have an immediat and a subaltern Father This would be a Spur to excite even the most sleeping Lusts and a Poison that would fill the gentlest Spirits with the most violent Furys If men should believe this there would hardly be found one of whom it might not be said  Hac spe minanti fulmen occurret Jovi  Senec Theb  No more is requir'd to fill the World with Fire and Blood than the reception of these Precepts No man can look upon that as a Wickedness which shall render him Sacred nor fear to attempt that which shall make him God's Vicegerent And I doubt whether the wickedness of filling mens heads with such Notions was ever equal'd unless by him who said  Ye shall not die but be as Gods  But since our Author is pleas'd to teach us these strange things I wish he would also have told us how many men in every Nation ought to be look'd upon as adopted Fathers What proportion of Riches Ability or Merit is naturally or divinely requir'd to make them capable of this sublime Character Whether the Right of this Chimerical Father dos not destroy that of the Natural or whether both continue in force and men thereby stand oblig'd in despite of what Christ said to serve two Masters For if the Right of my Artificial Father arise from any Act of the King in favour of his Riches Abilitys or Merit I ought to know whether he is to excel in all or any one of these Points How far and which of 'em gives the preference since 'tis impossible for me to determin whether my Father who may be wise tho not rich is thereby devested of his Right and it comes to be transfer'd to another who may be rich tho not wise nor of any personal merit at all till that Point be decided or so much as to guess when I am emancipated from the Duty I owe to him by whom I was begotten and educated unless I know whether he be fallen from his Right thro want of Merit Wisdom or Estate and that can never be till it be determin'd that he has forfeited his Right by being defective in all or any of the three and what proportion of Merit Wisdom or Estate is requir'd in him sor the enjoyment of his Right or in another that would acquire it for no man can succeed to the Right of another unless the first Possessor be rightly depriv'd of it and it cannot belong to them both because common sense universally teaches that two distinct Persons cannot at the same time and in the same degree have an equal Right to the same individual thing  The Right of Father cannot therefore be confer'd upon Princes by Kings but must for ever follow the Rule of Nature The Character of a Father is indelible and incommunicable The Duty of Children arising from Benefits receiv'd is perpetual because they can never not have receiv'd them and can be due only to him from whom they are receiv'd For these Reasons we see that such as our Author calls Princes cannot confer it upon a King for they cannot give what they have not in themselves They who have nothing can give nothing They who are only supposititious cannot make another to be real and the Whimsy of Kings making Princes to be Fathers and Princes conferring that Right on Kings comes to nothing  SECT XX All just Magistratical Power is from the People  HAVING prov'd that the Right of a Father proceeds from the Generation and Education of his Children That no man can have that Right over those whom he has not begotten and educated That every man has it over those who owe their Birth and Education to him That all the Sons of  Noah Abraham Isaac Jacob  and others did equally inherit it That by the same Reasons it dos for ever belong to every man that begets Children it plainly appears that no Father can have a Right over others unless it be by them granted to him and that he receive his Right from those who granted it But our Author with an admirable sagacity peculiar to himself discovers and with equal confidence tells us that that which is from the People or the chief Heads of them is not from the People  He that is so elected  says he  claims not his Right from the People as a Donative but from God  That is if I mistake not  Romulus  was not made King of the  Romans  by that People but by God Those men being newly gather'd together had two Fathers tho neither of them had any Children and no man knew who was their Father nor which of 'em was the elder But  Romulus  by the slaughter of his Brother decided all Questions and purchas'd to himself a Royal Charter from God and the Act of the People which confer'd the Power on him was the Act of God We had formerly learnt that whatsoever was done by Monarchs was to be imputed to God and that whosoever murder'd the Father of a People acquir'd the same Right to himself but now it seems that Nations also have the same privilege and that God dos what they do Now I understand why it was said of old  Vox Populi est Vox Dei  But if it was so in regard of  Romulus  the same must be confest of  Tullus Hostilius Ancus Martius Tarquinius Priscus  and  Servius Tullus  who being all strangers to each other and most of them Aliens also were successively advanc'd by the same People without any respect to the Children Relations or Heirs of their Predecessors And I cannot comprehend why the Act of the same People should not have the same Virtue and be equally attributed to God when they gave the same or more power to Consuls Military Tribunes  Decemviri  or Dictators or why the same Divine Character should not be in the same manner confer'd upon any Magistracys that by any People have bin are or shall be at any time erected for the same ends  Upon the same grounds we may conclude that no Privilege is peculiarly annex'd to any Form of Government but that all Magistrats are equally the Ministers of God who perform the Work for which they were instituted and that the People which institutes them may proportion regulate and terminate their Power as to time measure and number of Persons as seems most convenient to themselves which can be no other than their own good For it cannot be imagin'd that a multitude of People should send for  Numa  or any other Person to whom they ow'd nothing to reign over 'em that he might live in Glory and Pleasure or for any other reason than that it might be good for them and their Posterity This shews the Work of all Magistrats to be always and every where the same even the doing of Justice and procuring the Welfare of those that create them This we learn from common sense  Plato Aristotle Cicero  and the best human Authors lay it as an unmovable Foundation upon which they build their Arguments relating to matters of that nature And the Apostle from better Authority declares  Rom  That Rulers are not a terror to good Works but to Evil Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same for he is the Minister of God unto thee for good But if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he bears not the Sword in vain for he is the Minister of God a revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil  Tim  And the reason he gives  for praying for Kings and all that are in Authority  is  that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty  But if this be the Work of the Magistrate and the glorious Name of God's Minister be given to him for the performance of it we may easily see to whom that Title belongs  His Children and Servants ye are whose Works ye do  He therefore and he only is the Servant of God who dos the Work of God who is a terror to those that do evil and a praise to those that do well who bears the Sword for the punishment of Wickedness and Vice and so governs that the People may live quietly in all godliness and honesty The order of his Institution is inverted and the Institution vacated if the Power be turn'd to the praise of those that do evil and becomes a terror to such as do well and that none who live honestly and justly can be quiet under it If God be the Fountain of Justice Mercy and Truth and those his Servants who walk in them no exercise of Violence Fraud Cruelty Pride or Avarice is patroniz'd by him and they who are the Authors of those Villanys cannot but be the Ministers of him who sets himself up against God because 'tis impossible that Truth and Falshood Mercy and Cruelty Justice and the most violent Oppression can proceed from the same Root It was a folly and a lie in those  Jews  to call themselves the Children of  Abraham  who did not the Works of  Abraham  and Christ declar'd them to be the Children  John  of the Devil whose Works they did which words proceeding from the Eternal Truth do as well indicate to us whose Child and Servant every man is to be accounted as to those who first heard them  If our Author's former Assertions were void of Judgment and Truth his next Clause shews a great defect in his Memory and contradicts the former  The Judgments of God  says he  who has Power to give and take away Kingdoms are most just yet the ministry of Men who execute God's Judgments without Commission is sinful and damnable  If it be true as he says that we are to look at the Power not the Ways by which it is gain'd and that he who has it whether it be by Usurpation Conquest or any other means is to be accounted as Father or right Heir to the  Father of the People to which Title the most sublime and divine Privileges are annex'd a man who by the most wicked and unjust Actions advances himself to the Power becomes immediatly the Father of the People and the Minister of God which I take to be a piece of Divinity worthy our Author and his Disciples  It may be doubted what he means by a Commission from God for we know of none but what is outwardly by his Word or inwardly by his Spirit and I am apt to think that neither he nor his Abettors allowing of either as to the Point in question he dos foully prevaricate in alledging that which he thinks cannot be of any effect If any man should say that the Word of God to  Moses Joshua Ehud Gideon Samuel Jeroboam  and  Jehu  or any others are in the like cases Rules to be observ'd by all because that which was from God was good that which was good is good and he that dos good is justified by it He would probably tell us that what was good in them is not good in others and that the Word of God dos justify those only to whom it is spoken That is to say No man can execute the just Judgments of God to the benefit of mankind according to the Example of those Servants of God without damnable sin unless he have a precise Word particularly directed to him for it as  Moses  had But if any man should pretend that such a Word was come to him he would be accounted an Enthusiast and obtain no credit So that which way soever the Clause be taken it appears to be full of Fraud confessing only in the Theory that which he thinks can never be brought into practice that his beloved Villanys may be thereby secur'd and that the glorious Examples of the most heroick Actions perform'd by the best and wisest men that ever were in the World for the benefit of mankind may never be imitated  The next Clause shews that I did our Author no wrong in saying that he gave a right to Usurpation for he plainly says  That whether the Prince be the supreme Father of his People or the true Heir of such a Father or whether he come to the Crown by Ʋsurpation or Election of the Nobles or People or by any other way whatsoever c it is the only Right and Authority of the natural Father  In the  d Chap  Sect  It skills not which way the King comes by his Power whether by Election Donation Succession or by any other means  And in another place  That we are to regard the Power not the Means by which it is gain'd  To which I need say no more than that I cannot sufficiently admire the ingeniously invented Title of Father by Usurpation and confess that since there is such a thing in the World to which not only privat men but whole Nations owe obedience whatsoever has bin said antiently as was thought to express the highest excess of Fury and Injustice as  Jus datum sceleri Jus omne in ferro est situm  Lucan c  Jus licet in jugulos nostros sibi fecerit ense Sylla potens Marius{que} ferox Cinna cruentus Caesareaeque domus series  were solid Truths good Law and Divinity which did not only signify the actual exercise of the Power but induc'd a conscientious Obligation of obeying it The Powers so gain'd did carry in themselves the most sacred and inviolable Rights and the actors of the most detestable Villanys thereby became the Ministers of God and the Fathers of their subdu'd People Or if this be not true it cannot be denied that  Filmer  and his followers in the most impudent and outragious Blasphemy have surpast all that have gone before 'em  To confirm his Assertion he gives us a wonderful explanation of the fisth Commandment which he says enjoins Obedience to Princes under  the terms of  Honour thy Father and thy Mother  drawing this Inference  That as all Power is in the Father the Prince who hath it cannot be restrain'd by any Law which being grounded upon the perfect likeness between Kings and Fathers no man can deny it to be true  But if  Claudius  was the Father of the  Roman  People I suppose the chast  Messalina  was the Mother and to be honour'd by virtue of the same Commandment But then I fear that such as met her in the most obscene places were not only guilty of Adultery but of Incest The same Honour must needs belong to  Nero  and his vertuous  Poppaea  unless it were transfer'd to his newmade Woman  Sporus  or perhaps he himself was the Mother and the glorious Title of  Pater Patriae  belong'd to the Rascal who married him as a Woman The like may be said of  Agathocles Dionysius Phalaris Busiris Machanidas Peter  the Cruel of  Castile Christiern  of  Denmark  the last Princes of the House of  Valois  in  France  and  Philip  the Second of  Spain  Those Actions of theirs which men have ever esteem'd most detestable and the whole course of their abominable Government did not proceed from Pride Avarice Cruelty Madness and Lust but from the tender care of most pious Fathers  Tacitus  sadly describes the state of his Country  Ʋrbs incendiis vastata consumptis antiquissimis delubris ipso Capitolio Civium manibus incenso pollutae Ceremoniae magna Adulteria plenum Exiliis mare infecti caedibus scopuli atrocius in Ʋrbe saevitum Nobilitas opes omissi vel gesti honores pro crimine ob virtutes certissimum exitium  But he was to blame all this proceeded from the ardency of a paternal Affection When  Nero  by the death of  Helvidius Priscus  and  Thraseas  endeavour'd to cut up Vertue by the roots  ipsam exscindere virtutem  he did it because he knew it was good for the World that there should be no vertuous man in it When he fir'd the City and when  Caligula  wish'd the People had but one Neck that he might strike it off at one blow they did it thro a prudent care of their Childrens good knowing it would be for their advantage to be destroy'd and that the empty desolated World would be no more troubled with popular Seditions By the same rule  Pharaoh Eglon Nebuchodonosor Antiochus Herod  and the like were Fathers of the  Hebrews  And without looking far backward or depending upon the Faith of History we may enumerate many Princes who in a perpetual care of their People have not yielded to  Nero  or  Caligula  If our Author say true all those Actions of theirs which we have ever attributed to the utmost excess of Pride Cruelty Avarice and Perfidiousness proceeded from their princely Wisdom and fatherly Kindness to the Nations under 'em and we are beholden to him for the discovery of so great a Mystery which has bin hid from mankind from the beginning of the World to this day if not we may still look upon them as Children of the Devil and continue to believe that Princes as well as other Magistrats were set up by the People for the publick Good that the Praises given to such as are Wise Just and Good are purely personal and can belong only to those who by a due exercise of their Power do deserve it and to no others  CHAP II  SECT I That 'tis natural for Nations to govern or to chuse Governors and that Vertue only gives a natural preference of one man above another or reason why one should be chosen rather than another  IN this Chapter our Author fights valiantly against  Bellarmin  and  Suarez  seeming to think himself victorious if he can shew that either of them has contradicted the other or himself but being no way concern'd in them I shall leave their followers to defend their Quarrel My work is to seek after Truth and tho they may have said some things in matters not concerning their beloved Cause of Popery that are agreeable to Reason Law or Scripture I have little hope of finding it among those who apply themselves chiefly to School Sophistry as the best means to support Idolatry That which I maintain is the Cause of Mankind which ought not to suffer tho Champions of corrupt Principles have weakly defended or maliciously betray'd it and therefore not at all relying on their Authority I intend to reject whatsoever they say that agrees not with Reason Scripture or the approv'd Examples of the best polish'd Nations He also attacks  Plato  and  Aristotle  upon whose Opinions I set a far greater value in as much as they seem to have penetrated more deeply into the secrets of human Nature and not only to have judg'd more rightly of the Interests of Mankind but also to have comprehended in their Writings the Wisdom of the  Grecians  with all that they had learn'd from the  Phaenicians Egyptians  and  Hebrews  which may lead us to the discovery of the Truth we seek If this be our work the question is not whether it be a  Paradox  or  a receiv'd Opinion That People naturally govern or chuse Governors  but whether it be true or not for many Paradoxes are true and the most gross Errors have often bin most common Tho I hope to prove that what he calls a Paradox is not only true but a Truth planted in the hearts of men and acknowledg'd so to be by all that have hearkned to the voice of Nature and disapprov'd by none but such as thro wickedness stupidity or baseness of Spirit seem to have degenerated into the worst of beasts and to have retain'd nothing of men but the outward shape or the ability of doing those mischiefs which they have learn'd from their Master the Devil  We have already seen that the Patriarchical Power resembles not the Regal in principle or practice that the beginning and continuance of Regal Power was contrary to and inconsistent with the Patriarchical that the first Fathers of mankind left all their Children independent on each other and in an equal liberty of providing for themselves that every man continu'd in this liberty till the number so increas'd that they became troublesom  and dangerous to each other and finding no other remedy to the disorders growing or like to grow among them join'd many Familys into one civil Body that they might the better provide for the conveniency safety and defence of themselves and their Children This was a collation of every man's privat Right into a publick Stock and no one having any other right than what was common to all except it were that of Fathers over their Children they were all equally free when their Fathers were dead and nothing could induce 'em to join and lessen that natural liberty by joining in Societys but the hopes of a publick Advantage Such as were wise and valiant procur'd it by setting up regular Governments and placing the best Men in the Administration whilst the weakest and basest fell under the power of the most boisterous and violent of their Neighbours Those of the first sort had their root in Wisdom and Justice and are call'd lawful Kingdoms or Commonwealths and the Rules by which they are govern'd are known by the name of Laws These Governments have ever bin the Nurses of Vertue The Nations living under them have flourish'd in Peace and Happiness or made Wars with Glory and Advantage whereas the other sort springing from Violence and Wrong have ever gone under the odious title of Tyrannys and by fomenting Vices like to those from whence they grew have brought shame and misery upon those who were subject to them This appears so plainly in Scripture that the assertors of Liberty want no other Patron than God himself and his Word so fully justifies what we contend for that it were not necessary to make use of human Authority if our Adversarys did not oblige us to examin such as are cited by them This in our present case would be an easy work if our Author had rightly mark'd the passages he would make use of or had bin faithful in his Interpretation or Explication of such as he truly cites but failing grosly in both 'tis hard to trace him  He cites the  th  Chapter of the third Book of  Aristotle  's Politicks and I do not find there is more than twelve or tho that Wound might be cur'd by saying the Words are in the twelfth his Fraud in perverting the Sense were unpardonable tho the other mistake be past over 'Tis true that  Aristotle  dos there seem to doubt whether there be any such thing as one man naturally a Lord over many Citizens since a City consists of Equals but in the whole scope of that Chapter Book and his other Writings he fully shews his doubt did not arise from an imagination that one man could naturally inherit a Right of Dominion over many not descended from him or that they were born under a necessity of being Slaves to him for such fancys can proceed only from distemper'd Brains but that Civil Societys aiming at the publick good those who by nature were endow'd with such Vertues or Talents as were most beneficial to them ought to be prefer'd And nothing can be more contrary to the frantick whimsy of our Author who fancys an hereditary Prerogative of Dominion inherent to a person as Father of a People or Heir or to be reputed Heir of the first Father when 'tis certain he is not but that either he or his Predecessor came in by Election or Usurpation than to shew that 'tis only Wisdom Justice Valour and other commendable Vertues which are not hereditary that can give the preserence and that the only reason why it should be given is that Men so qualify'd can better than others accomplish the end for which Societys are constituted  Ar  st Pol  For  tho  says he  all are equally free all are not equally endow'd with those Vertues that render Liberty safe prosperous and happy  That equality  which is just among Equals is just only among Equals but such as are base ignorant vicious slothful or cowardly are not equal in natural or acquir'd Vertues to the generous wise valiant and industrious nor equally useful to the Societys in which they live they cannot therefore have an equal part in the Government of 'em they cannot equally provide for the common good and 'tis not a personal but a publick Benefit that is sought in their constitution and continuance There may be a hundred thousand men in an Army who are all equally free but they only are naturally most fit to be Commanders or Leaders who most excel in the Vertues requir'd for the right performance of those Offices and that not because 'tis good for them to be rais'd above their Brethren but because 'tis good for their Brethren to be guided by them as 'tis ever good to be govern'd by the wisest and the best If the nature of man be Reason  Detur digniori  in matters of this kind is the voice of Nature and it were not only a deviation from Reason but a most desperate and mischievous madness for a Company going to the  Indies  to give the guidance of their Ship to the Son of the best Pilot in the world if he want the skill requir'd to that employment or to one who was maliciously set to destroy them and he only can have a Right grounded upon the dictates of Nature to be advanc'd to the Helm who best knows how to govern it and has given the best testimonys of his Integrity and Intentions to imploy his skill for the good of those that are imbark'd But as the work of a Magistrat especially if he be the supreme is the highest noblest and most difficult that can be committed to the charge of a man a more excellent Vertue is requir'd in the Person to be advanc'd to it than for any other and he that is most excellent in that Vertue is reasonably and naturally to be prefer'd before any other  Aristotle  having this in his view seems to think that those who believ'd it not to be natural for one man to be Lord of all the Citizens since a City consists of Equals had not observ'd that inequality of Endowments Vertues and Abilitys in men which render some more fit than others for the performance of their Dutys and the Work intended but it will not be found as I suppose that he did ever dream of a natural Superiority that any man could ever have in a civil Society unless it be such a superiority in Vertue as most conduces to the publick good  He confirms this in proceeding to examin the different sorts of Governments according to the different dispositions of Nations and is so bold to say That a  popular Government is the best for a People who are naturally generous and warlike that the Government of a few sutes best with those among whom a few men are found to excel others in those Vertues that are profitable to Societys and that the Government of one is good when that one dos so far surpass all others in those Vertues that he has more of them than all the rest of the people together  And for the same reason that induc'd him to believe that equality is just amongst Equals he concludes inequality of Power to be most unjust unless there be inequality of Merit and equality of Power to be so also when there is inequality of Vertue that being the only rule by which every man's part ought to be regulated  But if it be neither reasonable nor just that those who are not equal in Vertue should be made equal in Power or that such as are equal in Vertue should be unequal in Power the most brutal and abominable of all extravagancys is to make one or a few who in Vertue and Abilitys to perform Civil Functions are inferior to others superior to all in power and the Miserys suffer'd by those Nations who inverting the Laws of Nature  and Reason have plac'd Children or Men of no Vertue in the Government when men that excel'd in all Vertues were not wanting do so far manifest this Truth that the pains of proving it may be spar'd  'Tis not necessary for me to inquire whether it be possible to find such a Man as  Aristotle  calls  Naturâ Regem  or whether he intended to recommend  Alexander  to the world for the Man design'd by God and Nature to be King over all because no man was equal to him in the Vertues that were beneficial to all For pursuing my Position that Vertue only can give a just and natural preference I ingenuously confess that when such a Man or race of Men as he describes shall appear in the world they carry the true marks of Sovereignty upon them We ought to believe that God has rais'd 'em above all whom he has made to excel all It were an impious folly to think of reducing him to the ordinary level of Mankind whom God has placed above it 'Twere better for us to be guided by him than to follow our own judgment nay I could almost say 'twere better to serve such a Master than to be free But this will be nothing to the purpose till such a Man or succession of men do appear and if our Author would persuade us that all Mankind or every particular is oblig'd to a perpetual subjection to one Man or Family upon any other condition he must do it by the credit of those who favour his Design more than  Aristotle  I know not who that will be but am confident he will find no help from  Plato  for if his Principles be examin'd by which a grave Author's sense is best comprehended it will appear that all his Books of Laws  Plato de Leg c  de Republ  and of a Commonwealth are chiefly grounded upon this  "That Magistrats are chosen by Societys seeking their own good and that the best men ought to be chosen for the attaining of it"  whereas his whole design of seeking which is the best form of Government or what Laws do most conduce to its perfection and permanency if one Rule were by nature appointed for all and none could justly transgress it if God had design'd an universal Lord over the whole World or a particular one over every Nation who could be bound by no Law were utterly absurd and they who write Books concerning Political matters and take upon 'em to instruct Nations how to govern themselves would be found either foolishly to mispend their time or impiously to incite People to rebel against the Ordinance of God If this can justly be imputed to  Plato  he is not the wise Man he is suppos'd to have bin and can less deserve the title of Divine which our Author gives him but if he remain justly free from such Censures it must be confest that whilst he seeks what is good for a people and to convince 'em by reason that it is so he takes it for granted that they have a liberty of chusing that which appears to  Plato de Leg  be the best to them He first says  "That this Good consists in the obtaining of Justice but farther explaining himself he shews that under the name of Justice he comprehends all that tends to their perfection and felicity in as much as every People by joining in a civil Society and creating Magistrats doth seek its own good and 'tis just that he or they who are created should to the utmost of their power accomplish the end of their Creation and lead the People to Justice without which there is neither perfection nor happiness That the proper act of Justice is to give to every one his due to Man that which belongs to Man and to God that which is God's But as no man can be just or desire to be so unless he know that Justice is good nor know that it is good unless he know that original Justice and Goodness  thro which all that is just is just and all that is good is good 'tis impossible for any man to perform the part of a good Magistrat unless he have the knowledg of God or to bring a People to Justice unless he bring them to the knowledg of God who is the Root of all Justice and Goodness"  If  Plato  therefore deserve credit he only can duly perform the part of a good Magistrate whose moral Vertues are ripen'd and heightned by a superinduction of Divine Knowledg  "The misery of Man proceeds from his being separated from God This Separation is wrought by corruption his restitution therefore to Felicity and Integrity can only be brought about by his reunion to the Good from which he is fallen"  Plato  looks upon this as the only worthy Object of Man's desire and in his Laws and Politicks he intends not to teach us how to erect Manufactures and to increase Trade or Riches but how Magistrats may be helpful to Nations in the manner before mention'd and consequently what men are fit to be Magistrats If our Author therefore would make use of  Plato  's Doctrin to his end he ought to have prov'd that there is a Family in every Nation to the chief of which and successively to the next in Blood God dos ever reveal and infuse such a knowledg of himself as may render him a Light to others and failing in this all that he says is to no purpose  The weakness in which we are born renders us unable to attain this Good of our selves we want help in all things especially in the greatest The fierce Barbarity of a loose Multitude bound by no Law and regulated by no Disciplin is wholly repugnant to it Whilst every man fears his Neighbour and has no other defence than his own strength he must live in that perpetual anxiety which is equally contrary to that happiness and that sedate temper of mind which is requir'd for the search of it The first step towards the cure of this pestilent Evil is for many to join in one body that every one may be protected by the united force of all and the various Talents that men possess may by good disciplin be render'd useful to the whole as the meanest piece of wood or stone being plac'd by a wise Architect conduces to the beauty of the most glorious Building But every man bearing in his own breast Affections Passions and Vices repugnant to this end and no man owing any submission to his Neighbour none will subject the correction or restriction of themselves to another unless he also submit to the same Rule They are rough pieces of timber or stone which 'tis necessary to cleave saw or cut This is the work of a skilful Builder and he only is capable of erecting a great Fabrick who is so Magistrats are Political Architects and they only can perform the Work incumbent on them who excel in Political Vertues Nature in variously framing the minds of men according to the variety of Uses in which they may be employ'd in order to the institution and preservation of Civil Societys must be our Guide in allotting to every one his proper work And  Plato  observing this Variety affirms  "That the Laws of Nature cannot be more absurdly violated than by giving the Government of a People to such as do not excel others in those Arts and Vertues that tend to the ultimate Ends for which Governments are instituted"  By this means those who are Slaves by Nature or render'd so by their Vices are often set above those that God and Nature had fitted for the highest Commands and Societys which subsist only by order fall into corruption when all Order is so preposterously inverted and the most extreme Confusion introduc'd This is an Evil that  Solomon  detested  Folly is set in great dignity and the  Eccl ▪  Rich sit in low places I have seen Servants upon Horses and Princes walking as Servants upon the Earth  They who understand  Solomon  's Language will easily see that the Rich and the Princes he means are such only who are rich in Vertue and Wisdom and who ought to be prefer'd for those Qualitys And when he says a Servant that reigneth is one of the  three things the Earth cannot bear  he can only mean such as deserve to be Servants for when they reign they do not serve but are serv'd by others Which perfectly agrees with what we learn from  Plato  and plainly shews that true Philosophy is perfectly conformable with what is taught us by those who were divinely inspir'd Therefore tho I should allow to our Author that  Aristotle  in those words  It seems to some not to be natural for one Man to be Lord of all the Citizens since the City consists of Equals  did speak the opinion of others rather than his own and should confess that he and his Master  Plato  did acknowledg a natural inequality among men it would be nothing to his purpose for the Inequality and the rational Superiority due to some or to one by reason of that Inequality did not proceed from Blood or Extraction and had nothing Patriarchical in it but consisted solely in the Vertues of the Persons by which they were render'd more able than others to perform their Duty for the good of the Society Therefore if these Authors are to be trusted whatsoever place a Man is advanc'd to in a City 'tis not for his own sake but for that of the City and we are not to ask who was his Father but what are his Vertues in relation to it This induces a necessity of distinguishing between a simple and a relative Inequality for if it were possible for a man to have great Vertues and yet no way beneficial to the Society of which he is or to have some one Vice that renders 'em useless he could have no pretence to a Magistratical Power more than any other They who are equally free may equally enjoy their freedom but the Powers that can only be executed by such as are endow'd with great Wisdom Justice and Valor can belong to none nor be rightly confer'd upon any except such as excel in those Vertues And if no such can be found all are equally by turns to participate of the Honors annex'd to Magistracy and Law which is said to be written Reason cannot justly exalt those whom Nature which is Reason has deprest nor depress those whom Nature has exalted It cannot make Kings Slaves nor Slaves Kings without introducing that Evil which if we believe  Solomon  and the Spirit by which he spoke  the Earth cannot bear  This may discover what Lawgivers deserve to be reputed wise or just and what Decrees or Sanctions ought to be reputed Laws  Aristotle  proceeding by this Rule rather tells us who is naturally a King than where we should find him and after having given the highest Praises to this true natural King and his Government he sticks not to declare that of one Man in Vertue equal or inferior to others to be a mere Tyranny even the worst of all as it is the corruption of the best or as our Author calls it the most Divine and such as can be fit only for those barbarous and stupid Nations which tho bearing the shape of Men are little different from Beasts Whoever therefore will from  Aristotle  's words inser that Nature has design'd one Man or succession of Men to be Lords of every Country must shew that Man to be endow'd with all the Vertues that render him fit for so great an Office which he dos not bear for his own Pleasure Glory or Profit but for the good of those that are under him and if that be not done he must look after other Patrons than  Aristotle  for his opinion  Plato  dos more explicitly say that the Civil or Politick Man the Shepherd Father or King of the People is the same design'd for the same Work enabled to perform it by the excellency of the same Vertues and made perfect by the infusion of the divine Wisdom This is  Plato  's Monarch and I confess that wheresoever he dos appear in the World he ought to be accounted as sent from God for the good of that People His Government is the best that can be set up among Men and if assurance can be given that his Children Heirs or Successors shall for ever be equal to him in the abovemention'd Vertues it were a folly and a sin to bring him under the government of any other or to an equality with them since God had made him to excel them all and 'tis better for them to be rul'd by him than to follow their own judgment This is that which gives him the preference  He is wise thro the knowledg of the Truth  Plato in Al  ib l    and thereby becomes good happy pure beautiful and perfect The divine Light shining forth in him is a guide to others and he is a fit Leader of a People to the good that he enjoys  If this can be exprest by words in fashion this is his  Prerogative  this is the  Royal Charter  given to him by God and to him only who is so adapted for the performance of his Office He that should pretend to the same Privileges without the same Abilitys to perform the Works for which they are granted would exceed the folly of a Child that takes upon him a burden which can only be born by a Giant or the madness of one who presumes to give Physick and understands not the Art of a Physician thereby drawing guilt upon himself and death upon his Patient It were as vain to expect that a Child should carry the Giant's burden and that an ignorant man should give wholsom Physick as that one who lives void of all knowledg of Good should conduct men to it Whensoever therefore such a Man as is abovedescrib'd dos not appear Nature and Reason instruct us to seek him or them who are most like to him and to lay such burdens upon 'em as are proportionable to their strength which is as much as to say to prefer every man according to his merit and assign to every one such Works as he seems able to accomplish  But that  Plato  and  Aristotle  may neither be thought unreasonably addicted to Monarchy nor wholly rejecting it to have talk'd in vain of a Monarch that is not to be found 'tis good to consider that this is not a siction  Moses Joshua Samuel  and others were such as they define and were made to be such by that communion with God which  Plato  requires And he in all his Writings intending the institution of such a Disciplin as should render men happy wise and good could take no better way to bring his Countrymen to it than by shewing 'em that Wisdom Vertue and Purity only could make a natural difference among men  'Tis not my work to justify these Opinions of  Plato  and his Scholar  Aristotle  They were men and tho wise and learned subject to error If they err'd in these Points it hurts not me nor the Cause I maintain since I make no other use of their Books than to shew the impudence and prevarication of those who gather small scraps out of good Books to justify their Assertions concerning such Kings as are known amongst us which being examin'd are found to be wholly against 'em and if they were follow'd would destroy their Persons and Power  But our Author's intention being only to cavil or to cheat such as are not vers'd in the Writings of the Antients or at least to cause those who do not make Truth their Guide to waver and fluctuate in their Discourses  he dos in one page say  That without doubt  Moses  his History of the Creation guided these Philosophers in finding out this lineal Subjection  And in the next affirms  That the Ignorance of the Creation occasion'd several among the Heathen Philosophers to think that men met together as herds of Cattel  Whereas they could not have bin ignorant of the Creation if they had read the Books that  Moses  writ and having that knowledg they could not think that men met together as herds of Cattel However I deny that any of 'em did ever dream of that lineal Subjection deriv'd from the first Parents of mankind or that any such thing was to be learn'd from  Moses  Tho they did not perhaps justly know the beginning of Mankind they did know the beginnings and progress of the Governments under which they liv'd and being assur'd that the first Kingdoms had bin those which they call'd  Heroum Regna  that is of those who had bin most beneficial to Mankind that their Descendents in many places degenerating from their Vertues had given Nations occasion to set up  Aristocracys  and they also falling into corruption to institute  Democracys  or mix'd Governments did rightly conclude That every Nation might justly order their own Affairs according to their own pleasure and could have neither obligation nor reason to set up one man or a few above others unless it did appear to them that they had more of those Vertues which conduce to the good of Civil Societys than the rest of their Brethren  Our Author's cavil upon  Aristotle  's Opinion  That those who are wise in mind are by nature fitted to be Lords and those who are strong of body ordain'd to obey  deserves no answer for he plainly falsifies the Text  Aristotle  speaks only of those Qualitys which are requir'd for every purpose and means no more than that such as are eminent in the Virtues of the mind deserve to govern tho they do not excel in bodily strength and that they who are strong of body tho of little understanding and uncapable of commanding may be useful in executing the commands of others But is so far from denying that one man may excel in all the perfections of mind and body that he acknowledges him only to be a King by nature who dos so both being requir'd for the full performance of his Duty And if this be not true I suppose that one who is like  Agrippa Posthumus Corporis viribus stolide ferox  may be fit to govern many Nations and  Moses  or  Samuel  if they naturally wanted bodily strength or that it decay'd by age might justly be made Slaves which it a discovery worthy our Author's invention  SECT II Every Man that has Children has the right of a Father and is capable of preferment in a Society compos'd of many  I Am not concern'd in making good what  Suarez  says A Jesuit may speak that which is true but it ought to be receiv'd as from the Devil cautiously lest mischief be hid under it and Sir  Robert  's frequent prevarications upon the Scripture and many good Authors give reason to suspect he may have falsify'd one that few Protestants read if it serv'd to his purpose and not mentioning the place his fraud cannot easily be discover'd unless it be by one who has leisure to examin all his vastly voluminous Writings But as to the point in question that pains  may be sav'd there is nothing that can be imputed to the invention of  Suarez  for  that  Adam  had only an Oeconomical not a Political Power  is not the voice of a Jesuit but of Nature and common Sense for Politick signifying no more in Greek than Civil in Latin 'tis evident there could be no Civil Power where there was no Civil Society and there could be none between him and his Children because a Civil Society is compos'd of Equals and fortify'd by mutual compacts which could not be between him and his Children at least if there be any thing of truth in our Author's Doctrin  That all Children do perpetually and absolutely depend upon the Will of their Father Suarez  seems to have bin of another opinion and observing the benefits we receive from Parents and the Veneration we owe to 'em to be reciprocal he could not think any Duty could extend farther than the knowledg of the Relation upon which it was grounded and makes a difference between the Power of a Father before and after his Children are made free that is in truth before and after they are able to provide for themselves and to deliver their Parents from the burden of taking care of them Which will appear rational to any who are able to distinguish between what a Man of years old subsisting by himself and having a Family of his own or a Child of eight dos owe to his Father The same reason that obliges a Child to submit intirely to the Will of his Parents when he is utterly ignorant of all things dos permit and often enjoin men of ripe age to examin the Commands they receive before they obey them and 'tis not more plain that I owe all manner of duty affection and respect to him that did beget and educate me than that I can owe nothing on any such account to one that did neither  This may have bin the opinion of  Suarez  but I can hardly believe such a notion as  that  Adam  in process of time might have Servants  could proceed from any other brain than our Author's for if he had liv'd to this day he could have had none under him but his own Children and if a Family be not compleat without Servants his must always have bin defective and his Kingdom must have bin so too if that has such a resemblance to a Family as our Author fancies This is evident that a hard Father may use his Children as Servants or a rebellious stubborn Son may deserve to be so us'd and a gentle and good Master may shew that kindness to faithful and welldeserving Servants which resembles the sweetness of a fatherly rule but neither of 'em can change their nature a Son can never grow to be a Servant nor a Servant to be a Son If a Family therefore be not compleat unless it consist of Children and Servants it cannot be like to a Kingdom or City which is compos'd of Freemen and Equals Servants may be in it but are not Members of it As Truth can never be repugnant to Justice 'tis impossible this should be a prejudice to the paternal Rule which is most just especially when a grateful remembrance of the benefits receiv'd dos still remain with a necessary and perpetual obligation of repaying them in all affection and duty whereas the care of ever providing for their Familys as they did probably increase in the time of our first longliving Fathers would have bin an insupportable burden to Parents if it had bin incumbent on 'em We do not find that  Adam  exercis'd any such power over  Cain  when he had slain  Abel  as our Author fancies to be Regal The Murderer went out and built a City for himself and call'd it by the name of his firstborn And we have not the least reson to believe that after  Adam  's death  Cain  had any Dominion over his Brethren or their Posterity or any one of them over him and his He fear'd that whosoever  saw him would kill him which language dos not agree with the Rights belonging to the haughty Title of Heir apparent to the Dominion of the whole Earth The like was practis'd by  Noah  and his Sons who set up Colonys for themselves but liv'd as privat men in obscure places whilst their Children of the fourth or fifth Generation especially of the youngest and accursed Son were great and powerful Kings as is fully prov'd in the first Chapter  Tho this had bin otherwise it would have no effect upon us for no argument drawn from the examples of  Shem Ham  and  Japhet  if they and their Children had continu'd under the Dominion of  Noah  as long as he liv'd can oblige me to resign my self and all my concernments absolutely into the hands of one who is not my Father But when the contrary is evidently true in them and their next ensuing Generations 'tis an admirable boldness in our Author to think of imposing upon us for an eternal and universal Law when the knowledg of our first Progenitors is utterly extinguish'd that which was not at all regarded by those who could not be ignorant of their own Original or the Duty thereby incumbent upon them or their immediate Fathers then living to whom the Rights must have belong'd if there had bin any such thing in nature or that they had bin of any advantage to them whereas in truth if there had bin such a Law in the beginning it must have vanish'd of it self for want of being exercis'd in the beginning and could not possibly be reviv'd after four thousand years when no man in the world can possibly know to whom the universal right of Dominion over the whole World or particular Nations dos belong for 'tis in vain to speak of a Right when no one man can have a better Title to it than any other But there being no precept in the Scripture for it and the examples directed or approv'd by God himself and his most faithful Servants being inconsistent with and contrary to it we may be sure there never was any such thing and that men being left to the free use of their own understanding may order and dispose of their own Affairs as they think fit No man can have a better title than another unless for his personal Vertues every man that in the judgment of those concern'd excels in them may be advanc'd and those Nations that thro mistake set up such as are unworthy or do not take right measures in providing for a succession of men worthy and other things necessary to their welfare may be guilty of great folly to their own shame and misery but can do no injustice to any in relation to an hereditary Right which can be naturally in none  SECT III Government is not instituted for the good of the Governor but of the Governed and Power is not an Advantage but a Burden  THE Follys with which our Author endeavours to corrupt and trouble the World seem to proceed from his fundamental mistakes of the Ends for which Governments are constituted and from an Opinion that an excessive Power is good for the Governor or the diminution of it a prejudice whereas common sense teaches and all good men acknowledg that Governments are not set up for the Advantage Profit Pleasure or Glory of one or a few men but for tho good of the Society For  this reason  Plato  and  Aristotle  find no more certain way of distinguishing  "between a lawful King and a Tyrant than that the first seeks to procure the common Good and the other his own Pleasure or Profit and doubt not to declare That he who according to his Institution was the first destroys his own being and degenerates into the latter if he deflect from that rule He that was the best of Men becomes the worst and the Father or Shepherd of the People makes himself their Enemy"  And we may from hence collect that in all Controversys concerning the Power of Magistrats we are not to examin what conduces to their Profit or Glory but what is good for the Publick  His second Error is no less gross and mischievous than the first and that absolute Power to which he would exalt the chief Magistrate would be burdensom and desperately dangerous if he had it The highest Places are always slippery Mens eyes dazle when they are carried up to them and all falls from them are mortal Few Kings or Tyrants says  Sine caede sanguine pauci  Descendunt reges sicca morte Tyranni  Juven Sat  Juvenal  go down to the Grave in peace and he did not imprudently couple them together because in his time few or no Kings were known who were not Tyrants  Dionysius  thought no man left a Tyranny till he was drawn out by the heels But  Tacitus  says  Nescit quam grave intolerandum sit cuncta regendi onus Moses  could not bear it  Gideon  would not accept of any Resemblance of it The moral sense of  Jotham  's wise Parable is eternal The Bramble coveted the Power which the Vine Olive and Figtree refus'd The worst and basest of men are ambitious of the highest places which the best and wisest reject or if some who may be otherwise well qualify'd  In this place two pages are wanting in the Original Manuscript  as the fittest to be follow'd by Mankind If these Philosophers and Divines deserve credit  Nimrod Ninus Pharaoh  and the rest of that accursed Crew did not commit such excesses as were condemn'd by God and abhor'd by good Men but gaining to themselves the glorious Character of his Vicegerents left their practices as a perpetual Law to all succeeding Generations whereby the world and every part of it would be for ever expos'd to the violence cruelty and madness of the most wicked men that it should produce But if these Opinions comprehend an extravagancy of wickedness and madness that was not known among men till some of these Wretches presum'd to attempt the increase of that corruption under which Mankind groans by adding fuel to the worst of all Vices we may safely return to our Propositions That God having establish'd no such Authority as our Author fancies Nations are left to the use of their own Judgment in making provision for their own Welfare That there is no lawful Magistrate over any of them but such as they have set up that in creating them they do not seek the advantage of their Magistrate but their own And having found that an absolute Power over a People is a burden which no man can bear and that no wise or good Man ever desir'd it from thence conclude that it is not good for any to have it nor just for any to affect it tho it were personally good for himself because he is not exalted to seek his own good but that of the Publick  SECT IV The Paternal Right devolves to and is inherited by all the Children  THO the perversity of our Author's Judgment and Nature may have driven him into the most gross Errors 'tis not amiss to observe that many of those deliver'd by him proceed from his ignorance of the most important Differences between Father and Lord King and Tyrant which are so evident and irreconcilable that one would have thought no man could be so stupid as not to see it impossible for one and the same man at the same time to be Father and Master King and Tyrant over the same Persons But lest he should think me too scrupulous or too strict in inquiring after Truth I intend for the present to wave that inquiry and to seek what was good for  Adam  or  Noah  What we have reason to believe they desir'd to transmit to their Posterity and to take it for a perpetual Law in its utmost extent which I think will be of no advantage to our Author for this Authority which was universal during their lives must necessarily after their decease be divided as an Inheritance into as many parcels as they had Children The Apostle  Rom  says  If Children then Heirs Heirs of God and joint Heirs with Christ  which alluding to the Laws and Customs of Nations could have bin of no force unless it had bin true and known to be so But if Children are Heirs or joint Heirs whatsoever Authority  Adam  or  Noah  had is inherited by every man in the world and that title of Heir which our Author so much magnifys as if annex'd to one single person vanishes into nothing or else the words of the Apostle could have neither strength nor truth in them but would be built upon a false Foundation which may perhaps agree with our Author's Divinity  Yet if the Apostle had not declar'd himself so fully in this Point we might easily have seen that  Adam  and  Noah  did leave their Children in that equality for Fathers are ever understood to embrace all their Children with equal Affection till the discovery of personal Vertues or Vices makes a difference But the personal Vertues that give a reasonable preference of one before another or make him more fit to govern than the others cannot appear before he is nor can be annex'd to any one Line Therefore the Father cannot be thought to have given to one Man or his Descendents the Government of his Brethren and their Descendents  Besides tho the Law of  England  may make one man to be sole Heir of his Father yet the Laws of God and Nature do not so All the Children of  Noah  were his Heirs The Land promis'd to  Abraham Isaac  and  Jacob  was equally divided among their Children If the Children of  Joseph  made two Tribes it was not as the firstborn but by the Will of  Jacob  who adopted  Ephraim  and  Manasseh  and they thereby became his Sons and obtain'd an Inheritance equal to that of the other Tribes The Law allow'd a double Portion to the first begotten but this made a difference between Brothers only in  proportion  whereas that between Lord and Servant is in  specie  not in degree And if our Author's Opinion might take place instead of such a division of the common  Inheritance between Brothers as was made between the Children of  Jacob  all must continue for ever Slaves to one Lord which would establish a difference in  specie  between Brethren which Nature abhors  If Nature dos not make one man Lord over his Brethren he can never come to be their Lord unless they make him so or he subdue them If he subdue them it is an act of Violence contrary to Right which may consequently be recover'd If they make him Lord 'tis for their own sakes not for his and he must seek their good not his own lest as  Aristotle  says he degenerat from a King into a Tyrant He therefore who would persuade us that the Dominion over every Nation dos naturally belong to one Man Woman or Child at a venture or to the Heir whatsoever he or she be as to Age Sex or other Qualifications must prove it good for all Nations to be under them But as Reason is our Nature that can never be natural to us that is not rational Reason gives  Paria paribus  equal Power to those who have equal Abilitys and Merit It allots to every one the part he is most fit to perform and this fitness must be equally lasting with the Law that allots it But as it can never be good for great Nations having men amongst 'em of Vertue Experience Wisdom and Goodness to be govern'd by Children Fools or vicious and wicked Persons and we neither find that the Vertues requir'd in such as deserve to govern them did ever continue in any race of men nor have reason to believe they ever will it can never be reasonable to annex the Dominion of a Nation to any one Line We may take this upon  Solomon  's word  Wo to thee O Land when thy King  Eccl  is a Child and thy Princes eat in the morning  And I wish the experience of all Ages did not make this Truth too evident to us This therefore can never be the Work much less the Law of Nature and if there be any such thing in the world as the Dominion over a Nation inseparably united to a Man and his Family it can have no other Root than a civil or municipal Law which is not the subject of our Discourse  Moreover every Father's Right must cease when he ceases to be or be transmitted to those who being also Fathers have the same Title to it And tho the contrary method of annexing the whole Inheritance to one Person or exposing all his Brethren to be destroy'd by his rage if they will not submit may conduce to the enlargement of a proud and violent Empire as in  Turky  where he that gains the Power usually begins his Reign with the slaughter of his Brothers and Nephews yet it can never agree with the piety gentleness and wisdom of the Patriarchs or the Laws of God and Nature  These thing being agreed we need not trouble our selves with the Limits or Definition of a Family and as little with the Titles given to the Head of it 'Tis all one to us whether it be confin'd to one Roof and Fire or extended farther and none but such as are strangers to the practice of mankind can think that titles of Civility have a power to create a right of Dominion Every man in Latin is call'd  Dominus  unless such as are of the vilest condition or in a great subjection to those who speak to them and yet the word strictly taken relates only to  Servus  for a Man is Lord only of his Servant or Slave The  Italians  are not less liberal of the Titles of  Signore  and  Padrone  and the  Spaniards  of  Sennor  but he would be ridiculous in those Countrys who thereupon should arrogate to himself a right of Dominion over those who are so civil The vanity of our Age seems to carry this Point a little higher especially among the  French  who put a great weight upon the word  Prince  but  they cannot change the true signification of it and even in their sense  Prince du Sang  signifys no more than a chief Man of the Royal Blood to whom they pay much respect because he may come to the Crown as they at  Rome  do to Cardinals who have the Power of chusing Popes and out of whose number for some Ages they have bin chosen In this sense did  Scevola  when he was apprehended by  Porsenna  T Liv l  say  Trecenti conjuravimus Romanae juventutis Principes  which was never otherwise understood than of such young Citizens as were remarkable amongst their Companions And nothing can be more absurd than to think if the name of Prince had carried an absolute and despotical Power with it that it could belong to three hundred in a City that possest no more than a ten miles territory or that it could have bin given to them whilst they were young and the most part of their Fathers as is most probable still living  I should like our Author run round in a Circle if I should refute what he says of a Regal Power in our first Parents or shew that the Regal where it is is not absolute as often as he dos assert it But having already prov'd that  Adam Noah Abraham Isaac Jacob  c enjoy'd no such Power transmitted to every one of their Sons that which they had and they became Fathers of many great Nations who always continu'd independent on each other I leave to our Author to prove when and by what Law the Right of subdividing the Paternal Power was stop'd and how any one or more of their Descendents came to have that Power over their Brethren which none of their immediate Children had over theirs  His question to  Suarez  how and when Sons become free favours more of Jesuitical Sophistry than any thing said by the Jesuit but the Solution is easy for if he mean the respect veneration and kindness proceeding from gratitude it ceases only with the Life of the Father to whom it is due and the memory of it must last as long as that of the Son and if they had bin possest of such an absolute Power as he fancys it must have ceas'd with the reasons upon which it was grounded  First Because the Power of which a Father would probably have made a wise and gentle use could not be rightly trusted in the hands of one who is not a Father and that which tended only to the preservation of all the Children could not be turn'd to the increase of the Pride Luxury and Violence of one to the oppression of others who are equally Heirs  In the second place Societys cannot be instituted unless the Heads of the Familys that are to compose them resign so much of their Right as seems convenient into the publick Stock to which every one becomes subject But that the same Power should at the same time continue in the true Father and the figurative Father the Magistrate and that the Children should owe intire Obedience to the Commands of both which may often cross each other is absurd  Thirdly It ceases when it cannot be executed as when men live to see four or five Generations as many do at this day because the Son cannot tell whether he should obey his Father Grandfather or GreatGrandfather and cannot be equally subject to them all most especially when they live in divers places and set up Familys of their own as the Sons of the Patriarchs did which being observ'd I know no place where this Paternal Power could have any effect unless in the fabulous Island of  Pines  and even there it must have ceas'd when he died who  by the Inventor of the story is said to have seen above ten thousand Persons issued of his body  And if it be said that  Noah Shem Abraham  c consented that their Children should go where they thought fit and provide for themselves I answer that the like has bin done in all Ages and must be done for ever 'Tis the Voice of Nature obey'd not only by Mankind but by all living Creatures and there is none so stupid as not to understand it A Hen leaves her Chickens when they can seek their own nourishment A Cow looks after her Calf no longer than till it is able to feed A Lion gives over hunting for his Whelps when they are able to seek their own Prey and have strength enough to provide what is sufficient for themselves And the contrary would be an insupportable burden to all living Creatures but especially to Men for the good order that the rational Nature delights in would be overthrown and Civil Societys by which it is best preserv'd would never be establish'd  We are not concern'd to examin Whether the Political and Oeconomical Powers be intirely the same or in what they differ for that absolute Power which he contends for is purely despotical different from both or rather inconsistent with either as to the same Subject and that which the Patriarchs exercis'd having bin equally inherited by their Children and consequently by every one of their Posterity 'tis as much as is requir'd for my purpose of proving the natural universal Liberty of Mankind and I am no way concern'd in the Question Whether the first Parents of Mankind had a Power of Life and Death over their Children or not  SECT V Freemen join together and frame greater or lesser Societys and give such Forms to them as best please themselves  THis being establish'd I shall leave  Filmer  to fight against  Suarez  and  Bellarmin  or to turn one of them against the other without any concernment in the Combat or the success of it But since he thereupon raises a Question  Whether the supreme Power be so in the People that there is but one and the same Power in all the People of the World so that no Power can be granted unless all Men upon the Earth meet and agree to chuse a Governor  I think it deserves to be answer'd and might do it by proposing a Question to him Whether in his opinion the Empire of the whole World dos by the Laws of God and Nature belong to one Man and who that Man is Or how it came so to be divided as we have ever known it to have bin without such an injury to the Universal Monarch as can never be repair'd But intending to proceed more candidly and not to trouble my self with  Bellarmin  or  Suarez  I say that they who place the Power in a Multitude understand a Multitude compos'd of Freemen who think it for their convenience to join together and to establish such Laws and Rules as they oblige themselves to observe which Multitude whether it be great or small has the same Right because ten Men are as free as ten Millions of Men and tho it may be more prudent in some cases to join with the greater than the smaller number because there is more strength it is not so always But however every Man must therein  be his own judg since if he mistake the hurt is only to himself and the ten may as justly resolve to live together frame a Civil Society and oblige themselves to Laws as the greatest number of Men that ever met together in the World  Thus we find that a few Men assembling together upon the Banks of the  Tiber  resolv'd to build a City and set up a Government among themselves And the Multitude that met at  Babylon  when their design of building a Tower that should reach up to Heaven fail'd and their Language was confounded divided themselves as our Author says into seventy two parcels and by the same Right might have divided into more as their Descendents did into almost an infinite number before the death of their common Father  Noah  But we cannot find a more perfect Picture of Freemen living according to their own Will than in  Abraham  and  Lot  they went together into  Canaan  continu'd together as long as was convenient for them and parted when their Substance did so increase that they became troublesom to each other In the like manner  Ismael Isaac  and  Abraham  's six Sons by  Keturah  might have continu'd together and made one Nation  Isaac  and  Esau Moab  and  Ammon  might have done so too or all of them that came of the same Stock might have united together but they did not And their Descendents by the same rule might have subdivided perpetually if they had thought it expedient for themselves and if the Sons of  Jacob  did not do the like 'tis probable they were kept together by the hope of an Inheritance promis'd to 'em by God in which we find no shadow of a despotical Dominion affected by one as Father or Heir to the first Father or reputed to be the Heir but all continu'd  Gen  in that fraternal equality which according to  Abraham  's words to  Lot  they ought to do There was no Lord Slave or Vassal no strife was to be among them They were Brethren they might live together or separate as they found it convenient for themselves By the same Law that  Abraham  and  Lot Moab  and  Ammon Ismael Isaac  and the Sons of  Keturah Jacob Esau  and their Descendents did divide and set up several Governments every one of their Children might have done the like and the same Right remain'd to their Issue till they had by agreement engag'd themselves to each other But if they had no dependence upon each other and might live together in that fraternal equality which was between  Abraham  and  Lot  or separate and continue in that separation or reunite they could not but have a right of framing such conditions of their union as best pleas'd themselves By this means every number of Men agreeing together and framing a Society became a compleat Body having all Power in themselves over themselves subject to no other human Law than their own All those that compose the Society being equally free to enter into it or not no Man could have any Prerogative above others unless it were granted by the consent of the whole and nothing obliging them to enter into this Society but the consideration of their own Good that Good or the opinion of it must have bin the Rule Motive and End of all that they did ordain 'Tis lawful therefore for any such Bodys to set up one or a few Men to govern them or to retain the Power in themselves and he or they who are set up having no other Power but what is so confer'd upon them by that Multitude whether great or small are truly by them made what they are and by the Law of their own Creation are to exercise those Powers according to the proportion and to the ends for which they were given  These Rights in several Nations and Ages have bin variously executed in the establishment of  Monarchys Aristocracys Democracys  or  mix'd Governments  according to the variety of Circumstances and the Governments have bin good or evil according to the rectitude or pravity of their Institution and the vertue and wisdom or the folly and vices of those to whom the Power was committed but the end which was ever propos'd being the good of the Publick they only perform'd their duty who procur'd it according to the Laws of the Society which were equally valid as to their own Magistrats whether they were few or many  This might suffice to answer our Author's Question but he endeavours further to perplex it by a fiction of his own brain  That God gave this Power to the whole Multitude met and not to every particular Assembly of Men  And expects a proof  That the whole Multitude met and divided this Power which God gave them in gross by breaking it into parcels and by appointing a distinct Power to each Commonwealth  He also fathers it upon the Assertors of Liberty  and dos not see  as he says  how there can be an Election of a Magistrate by any Commonwealth that is not an Ʋsurpation upon the Privilege of the whole World unless all Mankind had met together and divided the Power into parcels which God had given them in gross  But before I put my self to the trouble of answering that which is but an Appendix to a whimsy of his own I may justly ask What hurt he finds in Usurpation who asserts that the same Obedience is due to all Monarchs whether they come in by Inheritance Election or Usurpation If Usurpation can give a Right to a Monarch why dos it not confer the same upon a People Or rather if God did in gross confer such a Right upon all Mankind and they neither did nor can meet together by consent to dispose of it for the good of the whole why should not those who can and do consent to meet together agree upon that which seems most expedient to them for the Government of themselves Did God create Man under the necessity of wanting Government and all the good that proceeds from it because at the first all did not and afterwards all could not meet to agree upon Rules Or did he ever declare that unless they should use the first opportunity of dividing themselves into such parcels as were to remain unalterable the right of reigning over every one shall fall to the first Villain that should dare to attempt it Is it not more consonant to the Wisdom and Goodness of God to leave to every Nation a liberty of repairing the Mischiefs fallen upon them thro the omission of their first Parents by setting up Governments among themselves than to lay 'em under a necessity of submitting to any that should insolently aspire to a Domination over them Is it not more just and reasonable to believe that the universal Right not being executed devolves upon particular Nations as Members of the great Body than that it should become the reward of Violence or Fraud Or is it possible that any one Man can make himself Lord of a People or parcel of that Body to whom God had given the liberty of governing themselves by any other means than Violence or Fraud unless they did willingly submit to him If this Right be not devolv'd upon any one Man is not the invasion of it the most outrageous Injury that can be done to all Mankind and most particularly to the Nation that is enslav'd by it Or if the Justice of every Government depends necessarily upon an original Grant and a Succession certainly deduc'd from our first Fathers dos not he by his own Principles condemn all the Monarchys of the World as the most detestable Usurpations since not one of 'em that we know do any way pretend to it Or tho I who deny  any Power to be just that is not founded upon Consent may boldly blame Usurpation is it not an absurd and unpardonable impudence in  Filmer  to condemn Usurpation in a People when he has declar'd that the Right and Power of a Father may be gain'd by Usurpation and that Nations in their Obedience are to regard the Power not the Means by which it was gain'd But not to lose more time upon a most frivolous fiction I affirm that the Liberty which we contend for is granted by God to every Man in his own Person in such a manner as may be useful to him and his Posterity and as it was exercis'd by  Noah Shem Abraham Isaac Jacob  c and their Children as has bin prov'd and not to the vast Body of all Mankind which never did meet together since the first Age after the Flood and never could meet to receive any benefit by it  His next Question deserves scorn and hatred with all the effects of either if it proceed from malice tho perhaps he may deserve compassion if his Crime proceed from ignorance  Was a general Meeting of a whole Kingdom  says he  ever known for the Election of a Prince  But if there never were any general Meetings of whole Nations or of such as they did delegate and entrust with the Power of the whole how did any Man that was elected come to have a Power over the whole Why may not a People meet to chuse a Prince as well as any other Magistrate Why might not the  Athenians Romans  or  Carthaginians  have chosen Princes as well as Archons Consuls Dictators or Suffetes if it had pleas'd them Who chose all the  Roman  Kings except  Tarquin  the proud if the People did not since their Historys testify that he was the first who took upon  T Liv l  him to reign  sine jussu populi  Who ever heard of a King of the  Goths  in  Spain  that was not chosen by the Nobility and People Or how could they chuse him if they did not meet in their Persons or by their Deputys which is the same thing when a People has agreed it should be so How did the Kings of  Sweden  come by their Power unless by the like Election till the Crown was made hereditary in the time of  Gustavus  the First as a Reward of his Vertue and Service in delivering that Country from the Tyranny of the  Danes  How did  Charles Gustavus  come to be King unless it was by the Election of the Nobility He acknowledg'd by the Act of his Election and upon all occasions that he had no other right to the Crown than what they had confer'd on him Did not the like Custom prevail in  Hungary  and  Bohemia  till those Countrys fell under the Power of the House of  Austria  and in  Denmark  till the Year Do not the Kings of  Poland  derive their Authority from this popular Election which he derides Dos not the stile of the Oath of Allegiance us'd in the Kingdom of  Arragon  as it is related by  Antonio Perez  Secretary of State to  Philip    d  shew that their Kings were of their own making Could they say  Nos que val  mos tanto come vos os hazemos neustro Rey con tal que no  guardeys nuestros suero  libertades  no no  Relacion de Ant Perez  We who are as good as you make you our King on condition that you keep and observe our Privileges and Libertys and if not not  if he did not come in by their Election Were not the  Roman  Emperors in disorderly times chosen by the Soldiers and in such as were more regular by the Senate with the consent of the People  Our Author may say the whole Body of these Nations did not meet at their Elections tho that is not always true for in the Infancy of  Rome  when the whole People dwelt within the Walls of a small City they did meet for the choice of their Kings as afterwards for the choice of other  Magistrats Whilst the  Goths Franks Vandals  and  Saxons  liv'd within the Precincts of a Camp they frequently met for the Election of a King and rais'd upon a Target the Person they had chosen but finding that to be inconvenient or rather impossible when they were vastly increas'd in number and dispers'd over all the Countrys they had conquer'd no better way was found than to institute  Gemotes Parliaments Diets Cortez Assemblys of Estates  or the like to do that which formerly had bin perform'd by themselves and when a People is by mutual compact join'd together in a civil Society there is no difference as to Right between that which is done by them all in their own Persons or by some deputed by all and acting according to the Powers receiv'd from all  If our Author was ignorant of these things which are the most common in all Historys he might have spar'd the pains of writing upon more abstruse Points but 'tis a stupendous folly in him to presume to raise Doctrins depending upon the universal Law of God and Nature without examining the only Law that ever God did in a publick manner give to Man If he had look'd into it he might have learnt That all  Israel  Sam  was by the command of God assembl'd at  Mispeth  to chuse a King and did chuse  Saul  He being slain all  Judah  came to  Hebron  and made  Sam  David  their King After the death of  Ishbosheth  all the Tribes went to  Sam  Hebron  and anointed him King over them and he made a Covenant with them before the Lord When  Solomon  was dead all  Israel  met together in  Shechem  and ten Tribes disliking the proceedings of  Rehoboam  King  rejected him and made  Jeroboam  their King The same People in the time of the Judges had general Assemblys as often as occasion did require to set up a Judg make War or the like And the several Tribes had their Assemblys to treat of Businesses relating to themselves The Historys of all Nations especially of those that have peopled the best parts of  Europe  are so full of Examples in this kind that no man can question them unless he be brutally ignorant or maliciously contentious The great matters among the  Germans  were transacted  omnium consensu De  C Tacit de mor Germ  minoribus consultant Principes de majoribus omnes  The  Michelgemote  among the  Saxons  was an Assembly of the whole People The  Baronagium  is truly said to be the same in as much as it comprehended all the Freemen that is all the People for the difference between  Civis  and  Servus  is irreconcilable and no man whilst he is a Servant can be a Member of a Commonwealth for he that is not in his own power cannot have a part in the Government of others All the foremention'd Northern Nations had the like customs among 'em The Governments they had were so instituted The utmost that any now remaining pretends to is to derive their right from them If according to  Filmer  these first Assemblys could not confer it upon the first they had none Such as claim under 'em can inherit none from those that had none and there can be no right in all the Governments we so much venerate and nothing can tend more to their overthrow than the reception of our Author's Doctrin  Tho any one Instance would be sufficient to overthrow his general negative Proposition for a Rule is not generally true if there be any just Exception against it I have alledg'd many and find it so easy to increase the number that there is no Nation whose Original we know out of whose Historys I will not undertake to produce the like But I have not bin solicitous precisely to distinguish which Nations have acted  in their own Persons and which have made use of Delegats nor in what times they have chang'd from one way to the other for if any have acted by themselves the thing is possible and whatsoever is done by delegated Powers must be refer'd to their Principals for none can give to any a Power which they have not in themselves  He is graciously pleas'd to confess That  when Men are assembled by a human Power that Power that dos assemble them may also limit the manner of the execution of that Power c But in Assemblys that take their Authority from the Law of Nature it is not so for what liberty or freedom is due to any man by the Law of Nature no inferior Power can alter limit or diminish No one man or multitude of men can give away the natural Right of another  c These are strong Lines and such as if there be any sense in them utterly overthrow all our Author's Doctrin for if any Assembly of men did ever take their Authority from the Law of Nature it must be of such as remaining in the intire fruition of their natural Liberty and restrain'd by no Contract meet together to deliberate of such matters as concern themselves and if they can be restrnin'd by no one man or number of men they may dispose of their own Affairs as they think fit But because no one of them is oblig'd to enter into the Society that the rest may constitute he cannot enjoy the benefit of that Society unless he enter into it He may be gone and set up for himself or set up another with such as will agree with him But if he enter into the Society he is oblig'd by the Laws of it and if one of those Laws be that all things should be determin'd by the plurality of Voices his Assent is afterwards comprehended in all the Resolutions of that Plurality  Reuben  or  Simeon  might according to the Laws of Nature have divided themselves from their Brethren as well as  Lot  from  Abraham  or  Ismael  and the Sons of  Keturah  from  Isaac  but when they in hopes of having a part in the Inheritance promis'd to their Fathers had join'd with their Brethren a few of their Descendents could not have a right by their dissent to hinder the Resolutions of the whole Body or such a part of it as by the first Agreement was to pass for an Act of the whole And the  Sam  Scripture teaches us that when the Lot was fallen upon  Saul  they who despis'd him were stil'd  Men of Belial  and the rest after his Victory over the  Ammonites  would have slain 'em if he had permitted In the like manner when a number of Men met together to build  Rome  any man who had dislik'd the design might justly have refus'd to join in it but when he had enter'd into the Society he could not by his Vote invalidate the Acts of the whole nor destroy the Rights of  Romulus Numa  and the others who by the Senat and People were made Kings nor those of the other Magistrats who after their expulsion were legally created  This is as much as is requir'd to establish the natural Liberty of Mankind in its utmost extent and cannot be shaken by our Author's surmise  That a Gap is thereby open'd for every seditious multitude to raise a new Commonwealth  For till the Commonwealth be establish'd no multitude can be seditious because they are not subject to any human Law and Sedition implies an unjust and disorderly opposition of that Power which is legally establish'd which cannot be when there is none nor by him who is not a Member of the Society that makes it and when it is made such as enter'd into it are oblig'd to the Laws of it  This shewing the root and foundation of Civil Powers we may judg of the use and extent of them according to the letter of the Law or the true intentional meaning of it both which declare them to be purely  Human Ordinances proceeding from the will of those who seek their own good and may certainly infer that since all Multitudes are compos'd of such as are under some Contract or free from all no Man is oblig'd to enter into those contracts against his own will nor oblig'd by any to which he dos not assent Those multitudes that enter into such Contracts and thereupon form Civil Societys act according to their own will Those that are engag'd in none take their Authority from the Law of Nature their Rights cannot be limited or diminish'd by any one Man or number of Men and consequently whoever dos it or attempts the doing of it violates the most sacred Laws of God and Nature  His cavils concerning Proxys and the way of using them deserve no answer as relating only to one sort of Men amongst us and can have no influence upon the Laws of Nature or the proceedings of Assemblys acting according to such Rules as they set to themselves In some places they have voted all together in their own persons as in  Athens  In others by Tribes as in  Rome  Sometimes by Delegats when the number of the whole People is so great that no one place can contain them as in the Parliaments Diets General Assemblys of Estates long us'd in the great Kingdoms of  Europe  In other Parts many Citys are join'd together in Leagues as antiently the  Achaians Etolians Samnites Tuscans  and in these times the States of  Holland  and Cantons of  Switzerland  but our Author not regarding such matters in pursuance of his folly with an ignorance as admirable as his stupidity repeats his Challenge  I ask  says he  but one Example out of the History of the whole World let the Commonwealth be nam'd wherever the Multitude or so much as the major part of it consented either by Voice or Procuration to the Election of a Prince  not observing that if an Answer could not be given he did overthrow the Rights of all the Princes that are or ever have bin in the World for if the Liberty of one Man cannot be limited or diminish'd by one or any number of Men and none can give away the Right of another 'tis plain that the Ambition of one Man or of many a faction of Citizens or the mutiny of an Army cannot give a Right to any over the Libertys of a whole Nation Those who are so set up have their root in Violence or Fraud and are rather to be accounted Robbers and Pirats than Magistrats  Leo Africanus  observing in his History that since the extinction  Leonis Afr Hist Africae  of  Mahomet  's Race to whom his Countrymen thought God had given the Empire of the World their Princes did not come in by the consent of those Nations which they govern'd says that they are esteem'd Thieves and that on this account the most honourable Men among the  Arabians  and  Moors  scorn to eat drink or make Alliances with them and if the case were as general as that Author makes it no better Rule could be any where follow'd by honourable and worthy Men But a good Cause must not be lost by the fault of an ill Advocate the Rights of Kings must not perish because  Filmer  knows not how to defend or dos maliciously betray them I have already prov'd that  David  and divers of the Judges were chosen by all  Israel Jeroboam  by ten Tribes all the Kings of  Rome  except  Tarquin  the Proud by the whole City I may add many Examples of the  Saxons  in our own Country  Ina  and  Offa  were made Kings  omnium consensu  These  All  are exprest plainly  Mat Paris  by the words  Archiepiscopis Episcopis Abbatibus Senatoribus Ducibus Populo terrae Egbert  and  Ethelward  came to the Crown by the same Authority  Omnium consensu Rex creatur Ethelwolf  the Monk  Necessitate  Guil Ma  s Polyd  cogente sac  us est Rex consensus publicus in regem dari petiit Ethelstan  tho a Bastard  electus est magno consensu Optimatum a Populo

Regem annuente Populo  And in another place  Edgarus ab omni Anglorum Populo electus est Ironside  being dead  Canutus  Florent  was receiv'd by the general consent of all  Juraverunt illi quod eum

Hardicanutus gaudenter ab omnibus suscipitur electus est  The same Author says that  Edward  the Confessor  electus est  Ingulf  in regem ab omni populo  And another  Omnium Electione in Edwardum concordatur  Tho the name of Conqueror be odiously given to  William  the  Norman  he had the same Title to the Crown with his Predecessors  In magna exultatione a Clero Populo susceptus ab omnibus Rex acclamatus  I cannot recite all the Examples of this kind that the History of almost all Nations furnishes unless I should make a Volume in bulk not inferior to the Book of  Martyrs  But those which I have mention'd out of the Sacred  Roman  and  English  History being more than sufficient to answer our Author's Challenge I take liberty to add that tho there could not be one Example produc'd of a Prince or any other Magistrate chosen by the general consent of the People or by the major part of them it could be of no advantage to the Cause he has undertaken to maintain For when a People has either indefinitely or under certain Conditions and Limitations resign'd their Power into the hands of a certain number of Men or agreed upon Rules according to which Persons should from time to time be deputed for the management of their Affairs the Acts of those Persons if their Power be without restrictions are of the same value as the Acts of the whole Nation and the assent of every individual Man is comprehended in them If the Power be limited whatsoever is done according to that limitation has the same Authority If it dos therefore appear as is testify'd by the Laws and Historys of all our Northern Nations that the power of every People is either wholly or to such a degree as is necessary for creating Kings granted to their several Gemotes Diets Cortez Assemblys of Estates Parliaments and the like all the Kings that they have any where or at any time chosen do reign by the same authority and have the same right as if every individual Man of those Nations had assented to their Election But that these Gemotes Diets and other Assemblys of State have every where had such Powers and executed them by rejecting or setting up Kings and that the Kings now in being among us have receiv'd their beginning from such Acts has bin fully prov'd and is so plain in it self that none but those who are grosly stupid or impudent can deny it which is enough to shew that all Kings are not set up by violence deceit faction of a few powerful Men or the mutinys of Armys but from the consent of such multitudes as joining together frame Civil Societys and either in their own Persons at general Assemblys or by their Delegats confer a just and legal Power upon them which our Author rejecting he dos as far as in him lies prove them all to be Usurpers and Tyrants  SECT VI They who have a right of chusing a King have the right of making a King  THO the Right of Magistrats dos essentially depend upon the consent of those they govern it is hardly worth our pains to examin  Whether the silent acceptation of a Governor by part of the People be an argument of their concurring in the election of him or by the same reason the tacit consent of the whole Commonwealth may be maintain'd  for when the question is concerning Right fraudulent surmises are of no value much less will it from thence follow  that a Prince commanding by Succession Conquest or Ʋsurpation may be said to be elected by the People  for evident marks of dissent are often given Some declare their hatred others murmur more privatly many oppose the Governour or Government and succeed according to the measure of their Strength Virtue or Fortune Many would resist but cannot and it were ridiculous to say that the Inhabitants of  Greece  the Kingdom of  Naples  or Dutchy of  Tuscany  do tacitly assent to the Government of the Great  Turk  King of  Spain  or Duke of  Florence  when nothing is more certain than that those miserable Nations abhor the Tyrannys they are under and if they were not master'd by a Power much too great for them they would soon free themselves And they who are under such Governments do no more assent to them tho they may be silent than a Man approves of being robb'd when without saying a word he delivers his Purse to a Thief that he knows to be too strong for him  'Tis not therefore the bare sufferance of a Government when a disgust is declar'd nor a silent submission when the power of opposing is wanting that can imply an Assent or Election and create a Right but an explicit act of Approbation when Men have ability and courage to resist or deny Which being agreed 'tis evident that our Author's distinction between  eligere  and  instituere  signifys nothing tho if the power of instituting were only left to Nations it would be sufficient for he is in vain elected who is not instituted and he that is instituted is certainly elected for his Institution is an Election As the  Romans  who chose  Romulus Numa  and  Hostilius  to be Kings and  Brutus Valerius  or  Lucretius  to be Consuls did make them so and their Right was solely grounded upon their Election The Text brought by our Author against this dos fully prove it  Him shalt thou set King over thee whom the Lord shall chuse  Deut  for God did not only make the institution of a King to be purely an act of the People but left it to them to institute one or not as should best please themselves and the words  whom the Lord shall chuse  can have no other signification than that the People resolving to have a King and following the Rules prescrib'd by his Servant  Moses  he would direct 'em in their choice which relates only to that particular People in covenant with God and immediately under his Government which no other was But this pains might have bin sav'd if God by a universal Law had given a rule to all The  Israelites  could not have bin three hundred years without a King and then left to the liberty of making one or not if he by a perpetual Law had ordain'd that every Nation should have one and it  had bin as well impertinent as unjust to deliberate who should be King if the Dominion had by right of Inheritance belong'd to one They must have submitted to him whether they would or not No care was to be taken in the election or institution of him who by his birth had a Right annex'd to his Person that could not be alter'd He could not have bin forbidden  to multiply Silver or Gold  who by the Law of his Creation might do what he pleas'd It had bin ridiculous to say  he should not raise his Heart above his Brethren  who had no Brethren that is no Equals but was rais'd above all by God who had impos'd upon all others a necessity of obeying him But God who dos nothing in vain did neither constitute or elect any till they desir'd it nor command 'em to do it themselves unless it so pleas'd themselves nor appoint 'em to take him out of any one Line Every  Israelite  might be chosen None but Strangers were excluded and the People were left to the liberty of chusing and instituting any one of their Brethren  Our Author endeavouring by  Hooker  's authority to establish his distinction between  eligere  and  instituere  destroys it and the paternal Right which he makes the foundation of his Doctrine  Heaps of Scripture are alledg'd  says he  concerning the solemn Coronation and Inauguration of  Saul David Solomon  and others by Nobles Antients and People of the Commonwealth of  Israel which is enough to prove that the whole work was theirs that no other had any title more than what they bestow'd upon him that the Kings were set up by the Nobles Antients and People Even God did no otherwise intervene than by such a secret disposition of the Lots by his Providence as is exercis'd in the Government of all the things in the World and we cannot have a more certain evidence that a paternal right to Dominion is a mere Whimsy than that God did not cause the Lot to fall upon the eldest of the eldest Line of the eldest Tribe but upon  Saul  a young Man of the youngest Tribe and afterwards tho he had design'd  David Solomon Jerobvam  and others who had no pretence to the paternal Right to be Kings he left both the election and institution of them to the Elders and People  But  Hooker  being well examin'd it will appear that his opinions are as contrary to the Doctrin of our Author as those we have mention'd out  Hooker  Eccl Pol l c  of  Plato  and  Aristotle  He plainly says  It is impossible that any should have a compleat lawful power over a multitude consisting of so many Familys as every politick Society dos but by consent of Men or immediate appointment from God Because not having the natural Superiority of Fathers their Power must needs be usurp'd and then unlawful or if lawful then either granted or consented to by them over whom they exercise the same or else given extraordinarily by God  And tho he thinks Kings to have bin the first Governors so constituted he adds  That this is not the only Regiment that has bin receiv'd in the World The inconveniences of one kind have caus'd sundry others to be devis'd So that in a word all publick Regiment of what kind soever seems evidently to have risen from deliberate advice consultation and composition between Men judging it convenient and behoofeful  And a little below  Man's Nature standing therefore as it doth some kind of regiment the Law of Nature dos require yet the kinds thereof being many Nature ties not to any one but leaves the choice as a thing arbitrary  And again  To live by one Man's will became all Mens misery This constrain'd them to come unto Laws c But as those Laws do not only teach that which is good but enjoin it they have in them a constraining force To constrain Men to any thing inconvenient seems unreasonable Most requisite therefore it is that to devise Laws  which all Men should be forc'd to obey none but wise Men should be admitted Moreover that which we say concerning the power of Government must here be apply'd to the power of making Laws whereby to govern which Power God has over all and by the natural Law whereunto he has made all subject the lawful power of making Laws to command whole politick Societys of men belongs so properly to the same intire Societys that for any Prince or Potentate of what kind soever upon Earth to exercise the same of himself and not either by express commission immediately from God or else by authority deriv'd at the first from their consent upon whose persons they impose Laws it is no better than mere Tyranny Laws therefore they are not which publick consent has not made so  The humour of our Age consider'd I should not have ventur'd to say so much But if  Hooker  be a Man of such great Authority I cannot offend in transcribing his words and shewing how vilely he is abus'd by  Filmer  concluding that if he be in the right the choice and constitution of Government the making of Laws Coronation Inauguration and all that belongs to the chusing and making of Kings or other Magistrats is merely from the People and that all Power exercis'd over them which is not so is Usurpation and Tyranny unless it be by an immediate Commission from God which if any man has let him give testimony of it and I will confess he comes not within the reach of our reasonings but ought to be obey'd by those to whom he is sent or over whom he is plac'd  Nevertheless our Author is of another opinion but scorning to give us a reason he adds to  Hooker  's words  As if these Solemnitys were a kind of deed whereby the right of Dominion is given which strange untrue and unnatural Conceits are set abroad by Seedsmen of Rebellion  And a little farther  Ʋnless we will openly proclaim defiance to all Law Equity and Reason we must say for there is no remedy that in Kingdoms hereditary Birthright giveth a Right to Sovereign Dominion c Those Solemnitys do either serve for an open testification of the Inheritor's Right or belong to the form of inducing him into the possession  These are bold Censures and do not only reach Mr  Hooker  whose modesty and peaceableness of spirit is no less esteem'd than his Learning but the Scriptures also and the best of human Authors upon which he founded his Opinions But why should it be thought a strange untrue or unnatural Conceit to believe that when the Scriptures say  Nimrod  was the first that grew powerful in the Earth long before the death of his Fathers and could consequently neither have a right of Dominion over the Multitude met together at  Babylon  nor subdue them by his own strength he was set up by their Consent or that they who made him their Governor might prescribe Rules by which he should govern Nothing seems to me less strange than that a multitude of reasonable Creatures in the performance of Acts of the greatest importance should consider why they do them And the infinite variety which is observ'd in the constitution mixture and regulation of Governments dos not only shew that the several Nations of the World have consider'd them but clearly prove that all Nations have perpetually continu'd in the exercise of that Right Nothing is more natural than to follow the voice of Mankind The wisest and best have ever employ'd their studys in forming Kingdoms and Commonwealths or in adding to the perfections of such as were already constituted which had bin contrary to the Laws of God and Nature if a general Rule had bin set that had oblig'd all to be for ever subject to the Will of one and they had not bin the best but the worst of men who had departed  from it Nay I may say that the Law given by God to his peculiar People and the Commands deliver'd by his Servants in order to it or the prosecution of it had bin contrary to his own eternal and universal Law which is impossible A Law therefore having bin given by God which had no relation to or consistency with the absolute paternal power Judges and Kings created who had no pretence to any preference before their Brethren till they were created and commanded not to raise their Hearts above them when they should be created the Wisdom and Vertue of the best men in all ages shewn in the constitution or reformation of Governments and Nations in variously framing them preserving the possession of their natural Right to be govern'd by none and in no other way than they should appoint The opinions of  Hooker That all publick Regiment of what kind soever arises from the deliberate advice of men seeking their own good and that all other is mere Tyranny  are not  untrue and unnatural conceits set abroad  by the  Seedsmen of Rebellion  but real Truths grounded upon the Laws of God and Nature acknowledg'd and practis'd by Mankind And no Nation being justly subject to any but such as they set up nor in any other manner than according to such Laws as they ordain the right of chusing and making those that are to govern them must wholly depend upon their Will  SECT VII The Laws of every Nation are the measure of Magistratical Power  OUR Author lays much weight upon the word  Hereditary  but the question is What is inherited in an Hereditary Kingdom and how it comes to be hereditary 'Tis in vain to say  the Kingdom  for we do not know what he means by the Kingdom 'tis one thing in one place and very different in others and I think it not easy to find two in the World that in power are exactly the same If he understands all that is comprehended within the precincts over which it reaches I deny that any such is to be found in the World If he refers to what preceding Kings enjoy'd no determination can be made till the first original of that Kingdom be examin'd that it may be known what that first King had and from whence he had it  If this variety be denied I desire to know whether the Kings of  Sparta  and  Persia  had the same power over their Subjects if the same whether both were absolute or both limited if limited how came the Decrees of the  Persian  Kings to pass for Laws If absolute how could the  Spartan  Kings be subject to Fines Imprisonment or the sentence of Death and not to have power to send for their own Supper out of the Common Hall Why did  Xenophon  call  Agesilaus  a good and faithful King obedient to the Laws of his Country when upon the command of the  Ephori  he left the War that he had with so much glory begun in  Asia  if he was subject to none How came the  Ephori  to be establish'd to restrain the Power of Kings if it could no way be restrain'd if all ow'd obedience to them and they to none Why did  Theopompus  his Wife reprove him for suffering his power to be diminish'd by their creation if it could not be diminish'd Or why did he say he had made the  Power more permanent in making it lefs odious if it was perpetual and unalterable We may go farther and taking  Xenophon  and  Plutarch  for our guides assert that the Kings of  Sparta  never had the powers of War or Peace Life and Death which our Author esteems inseparable from Regality and conclude either that no King has them or that all Kings are not alike in power If they are not in all places the same Kings do not reign by an universal Law but by the particular Laws of each Country which give to every one so much power as in the opinion of the givers conduces to the end of their Institution which is the publick good  It may be also worth our inquiry how this inherited Power came to be hereditary We know that the Sons of  Vespasian  and  Constantine  inherited the  Roman  Empire tho their Fathers had no such title But having gain'd the Empire by violence which  Hooker  says is mere Tyranny that can create no right they could devolve none to their Children The Kings of  France  of the three Races have inherited the Crown but  Meroveus Pepin  and  Hugh Capet  could neither pretend title nor conquest or any other Right than what was confer'd upon them by the Clergy Nobility and People and consequently whatsoever is inherited from them can have no other Original for that is the gift of the People which is bestow'd upon the first under whom the Successors claim as if it had bin by a peculiar Act given to every one of them It will be more hard to shew how the Crown of  England  is become hereditary unless it be by the Will of the People for tho it were granted that some of the  Saxon  Kings came in by inheritance which I do not having as I think prov'd them to have bin absolutely elective yet  William  the  Norman  did not for he was a Bastard and could inherit nothing  William Rufus  and  Henry  did not for their Elder Brother  Robert  by right of Inheritance ought to have bin prefer'd before 'em  Stephen  and  Henry  the second did not for  Maud  the only Heiress of  Henry  the first was living when both were crown'd  Richard  and  John  did not for they were Bastards born in adultery They must therefore have receiv'd their Right from the People or they could have none at all and their Successors fall under the same condition  Moreover I find great variety in the deduction of this hereditary Right In  Sparta  there were two Kings of different Familys endow'd with an equal power If the  Heraclidae  did reign as Fathers of the People the  Aeacidae  did not if the right was in the  Aeacidae  the  Heraclidae  could have none for 'tis equally impossible to have two Fathers as two thousand 'Tis in vain to say that two Familys join'd and agreed to reign jointly for 'tis evident the  Spartans  had Kings before the time of  Hercules  or  Achilles  who were the Fathers of the two Races If it be said that the Regal power with which they were invested did entitle 'em to the right of Fathers it must in like manner have belong'd to the  Roman  Consuls Military Tribunes Dictators and Pretors for they had more Power than the  Spartan  Kings and that glorious Nation might change their Fathers every year and multiply or diminish the number of 'em as they pleas'd If this be most ridiculous and absurd 'tis certain that the Name and Office of King Consul Dictator or the like dos not confer any determin'd Right upon the Person that has it Every one has a right to that which is allotted to him by the Laws of the Country by which be is created  As the  Persians Spartans Romans  or  Germans  might make such Magistrats and under such names as best pleas'd themselves and accordingly enlarge or diminish their Power the same Right belongs to all Nations and the Rights due unto as well as the Dutys incumbent upon every one are to be known only by the Laws of that place This may seem strange to those who know neither Books nor Things Historys nor Laws but is well explain'd by  Grotius  who denying the Sovereign Power to be annex'd to any Name speaks of divers Magistrats under several names that had and others that under the same names had it not and distinguishes  Grot de Jur bel pac l c  those who have the  Summum Imperium summo modo  from those who have it  modo non summo  and tho probably he look'd on the first sort as a thing merely speculative if by that  summo modo  a right of doing what one pleases be understood yet he gives many Examples of the other Among those who had  liberrimum imperium  if any had it he names the Kings of the  Sabeans  who nevertheless were under such a condition that tho they were as  Agatharchidas  reports obey'd in all things whilst they continu'd within the Walls of their Palace might be ston'd by any that met 'em without it He finds also another Obstacle to the Absolute power  Cum Rex partem habeat summi Imperii partem Senatus sive Populus  which parts are proportion'd according to the Laws of each Kingdom whether Hereditary or Elective both being equally regulated by them  The Law that gives and measures the Power prescribes Rules how it should be transmitted In some places the supreme Magistrats are annually elected in others their Power is for life in some they are merely elective in others hereditary under certain Rules or Limitations The antient Kingdoms and Lordships of  Spain  were hereditary but the Succession went ordinarily to the eldest of the reigning Family not to the nearest in Blood This was the ground of the Quarrel between  Corbis  T Liv l  the Brother and  Orsua  the Son of the last Prince decided by combat before  Scipio  I know not whether the  Goths  brought that custom with 'em when they conquer'd  Spain  or whether they learnt it from the Inhabitants but certain it is that keeping themselves to the Familys of  Saavedra corona Gothica  the  Balthei  and  Amalthei  they had more regard to Age than Proximity and almost ever prefer'd the Brother or eldest Kinsman of the last King  Marian Hist Hispan  before his Son The like custom was in use among the  Moors  in  Spain  and  Africa  who according to the several Changes that happen'd among the Familys of  Almohades Almoranides  and  Benemerini  did always take one of the reigning Blood but in the choice of him had most respect to Age and Capacity This is usually call'd the Law of  Thanestry  and as in many other places prevail'd also in  Ireland  till that Country fell under the  English  Government  In  France  and  Turky  the Male that is nearest in Blood succeeds and I do not know of any deviation from that Rule in  France  since  Henry  the First was prefer'd before  Robert  his elder Brother Grandchild to  Hugh Capet  But notwithstanding the great veneration they have for the Royal Blood they utterly exclude Females lest the Crown should fall to a Stranger or a Woman that is seldom able to govern her self should come to govern so great a People Some Nations admit Females either simply as well as Males or under a condition of not marrying out of their Country or without the consent of the Estates with an absolute exclusion of them and their Children if they do according to which Law now in force among the  Swedes Charles Gustavus  was chosen King  upon the resignation of Queen  Christina  as having no Title and the Crown setled upon the Heirs of his Body to the utter exclusion of his Brother  Adolphus  their Mother having married a  German  Tho divers Nations have differently dispos'd their Affairs all those that are not naturally Slaves and like to Beasts have prefer'd their own Good before the personal Interests of him that expects the Crown so as upon no pretence whatever to admit of one who is evidently guilty of such Vices as are prejudicial to the State For this reason the  French  tho much addicted to their Kings rejected the vile remainders of  Meroveus  his Race and made  Pepin  the Son of  Charles Martel  King And when his Descendents fell into the like Vices they were often depos'd till at last they were wholly rejected and the Crown given to  Capet  and to his Heirs Male as formerly Yet for all this  Henry  his Grandchild being esteem'd more fit to govern than his elder Brother  Robert  was as is said before made King and that Crown still remains in his Descendents no consideration being had of the Children of  Robert  who continu'd Dukes of  Burgundy  during the reigns of ten Kings And in the memory of our Fathers  Henry  of  Navarr  was rejected by two Assemblys of the Estates because he differ'd in Religion from the Body of the Nation and could never be receiv'd as King till he had renounc'd his own tho he was certainly the next in Blood and that in all other respects he excel'd in those Vertues which they most esteem  We have already prov'd that our own History is full of the like Examples and might enumerate a multitude of others if it were not too tedious and as the various Rules according to which all the hereditary Crowns of the World are inherited shew that none is set by Nature but that every People proceeds according to their own Will the frequent deviations from those Rules do evidently testify that  Salus Populi est Lex suprema  and that no Crown is granted otherwise than in submission to it  But tho there were a Rule which in no case ought to be transgrest there must be a Power of judging to whom it ought to be applied 'Tis perhaps hard to conceive one more precise than that of  France  where the eldest Legitimate Male in the direct Line is prefer'd and yet that alone is not sufficient There may be Bastardy in the case Bastards may be thought legitimate and legitimate Sons Bastards The Children born of  Isabel  of  Portugal  during her Marriage with  John  the Third of  Castile  were declar'd Bastards and the Title of the House of  Austria  to that Crown depends upon that Declaration We often see that Marriages which have bin contracted and for a long time taken to be good have bin declar'd null and the legitimation of the present King of  France  is founded solely upon the abolition of the Marriage of  Henry  the Fourth with  Marguerite  of  Valois  which for the space of twenty seven Years was thought to have bin good Whilst  Spain  was divided into five or six Kingdoms and the several Kings link'd to each other by mutual Alliances incestuous Marriages were often contracted and upon better consideration annul'd many have bin utterly void thro the preingagement of one of the Partys These are not feign'd Cases but such as happen frequently and the diversity of Accidents as well as the humours of Men may produce many others which would involve Nations in the most fatal Disorders if every one should think himself oblig'd to follow such a one who pretended a Title that to him might seem plausible when another should set up one as pleasing to others and there were no Power  to terminate those Disputes to which both must submit but the decision must be left to the Sword  This is that which I call the Application of the Rule when it is as plain and certain as human Wisdom can make it but if it be left more at large as where Females inherit the difficultys are inextricable and he that says the next Heir is really King when one is dead before he be so declar'd by a Power that may judg of his Title dos as far as in him lies expose Nations to be split into the most desperate Factions and every man to fight for the Title which he fancies to be good till he destroy those of the contrary Party or be destroy'd by them This is the blessed way propos'd by our Author to prevent Sedition But God be thank'd our Ancestors found a better They did not look upon  Robert  the  Norman  as King of  England  after the death of his Father and when he did proudly endeavour on pretence of Inheritance to impose himself upon the Nation that thought fit to prefer his younger Brothers before him he paid the penalty of his folly by the loss of his Eyes and Liberty The  French  did not think the Grandchild of  Pharamond  to be King after the death of his Father nor seek who was the next Heir of the  Merovingian  Line when  Chilperic  the Third was dead nor regard the Title of  Charles  of  Lorrain  after the death of his Brother  Lothair  or of  Robert  of  Burgundy  eldest Son of King  Robert  but advanc'd  Meroveus Pepin Capet  and  Henry  the First who had no other Right than what the Nobility and People bestow'd upon them And if such Acts do not destroy the Pretences of all who lay claim to Crowns by Inheritance and do not create a Right I think it will be hard to find a lawful King in the world or that there ever has bin any since the first did plainly come in like  Nimrod  and those who have bin every where since Historys are known to us ow'd their exaltation to the Consent of Nations arm'd or unarm'd by the deposition or exclusion of the Heirs of such as had reign'd before them  Our Author not troubling himself with these things or any other relating to the matter in question is pleas'd to slight  Hooker  's Opinions concerning Coronation and Inauguration with  the heaps of Scripture  upon which he grounds them whereas those Solemnitys would not only have bin foolish and impertinent but profane and impious if they were not Deeds by which the Right of Dominion is really confer'd What could be more wickedly superstitious than to call all  Israel  together before the Lord and to cast Lots upon every Tribe Family and Person for the election of a King if it had bin known to whom the Crown did belong by a natural and unalterable Right Or if there had bin such a thing in Nature how could God have caus'd that Lot to fall upon one of the youngest Tribe for ever to discountenance his own Law and divert Nations from taking any notice of it It had bin absurd for the Tribe of  Judah  to chuse and anoint  David  and for the other Tribes to follow their example after the death of  Ishbosheth  if he had bin King by a Right not depending on their Will  David  did worse in slaying the Sons of  Rimmon  saying they had kill'd a righteous Man lying upon his bed if  Ishbosheth  whose Head they presented had most unrighteously detain'd from him as long as he liv'd the Dominion of the ten Tribes The King Elders and People had most scornfully abus'd the most sacred things by using such Ceremonys in making him King and compleating their Work in a Covenant made between him and them before the Lord if he had bin already King and if those Acts  had bin empty Ceremonys conferring no Right at all  I dare not say that a League dos imply an absolute equality between both Partys for there is a  Foedus inequale  wherein the weaker as  Grotius  says dos usually obtain protection and the stronger honour but there can be none at all unless both Partys are equally free to make it or not to make it  David  therefore was not King till he was elected and those Covenants made and he was made King by that Election and Covenants  This is not shaken by our Author's Supposition  That the People would not have taken  Joas Manasseh  or  Josiah  if they had had a right of chusing a King since  Solomon  says Wo unto the Kingdom whose King is a Child  For first they who at the first had a right of chusing whom they pleas'd to be King by the Covenant made with him whom they did chuse may have depriv'd themselves of the farther execution of it and render'd the Crown hereditary even to Children unless the Conditions come to be violated upon which it was granted In the second place if the Infancy of a King brings Wo upon a People the Government of such a one cannot be according to the Laws of God and Nature for Governments are not instituted by either for the pleasure of a Man but for the good of Nations and their Weal not their Wo is sought by both And if Children are any where admitted to rule 'tis by the particular Law of the place grounded perhaps upon an opinion that it is the best way to prevent dangerous Contests or that other ways may be found to prevent the Inconveniences that may proceed from their weakness Thirdly It cannot be concluded that they might not reject Children because they did not Such matters require positive Proofs Suppositions are of no value in relation to them and the whole matter may be alter'd by particular Circumstances The  Jews  might reasonably have a great veneration for the House of  David  they knew what was promis'd to that Family and whatever respect was paid or privilege granted on that account can be of no advantage to any other in the world They might be farther induc'd to set up  Joas  in hope the defects of his Age might be supplied by the Vertue Experience and Wisdom of  Jehoiada  We do not know what good opinion may have bin conceiv'd of  Manasseh  when he was twelve years old but much might be hop'd from one that had bin virtuously educated and was probably under the care of such as had bin chosen by  Hezekiah  and tho the contrary did fall out the mischiefs brought upon the People by his wicked Reign proceeded not from the weakness of his Childhood but from the malice of his riper Years And both the Examples of  Joas  and  Josiah  prove that neither of 'em came in by their own right but by the choice of the People Jehoiada  gather'd the  Levites  out of all the Citys of  Judah  and the chief of the Fathers  Chron  of  Israel  and they came to  Jerusalem  And all the Congregation made a Covenant with the King in the House of God and brought out the King's Son and put upon him the Crown and gave him the Testimony and made him King  whereupon they slew  Athaliah And when  Ammon  was slain  Chron  the people of the Land slew them that had conspir'd against King  Ammon  and the people of the Land made  Josiah  his Son King in his stead  which had bin most impertinent if he was of himself King before they made him so Besides tho Infancy may be a just cause of excepting against and rejecting the next Heir to a Crown 'tis not the greatest or strongest 'Tis far more easy to find a Remedy against the folly of a Child if the State be well regulated than the more rooted Vices of grown men  The  English  who willingly receiv'd  Henry  the Sixth  Edward  the Fifth and Sixth tho Children resolutely oppos'd  Robert  the  Norman  And the  French  who willingly submitted to  Charles  the Ninth  Lewis  the Thirteenth and Fourteenth in their Infancy rejected the rude remainders of  Meroveus  his Race  Charles  of  Lorrain  with his Kindred descended from  Pepin Robert  Duke of  Burgundy  with his Descendents and  Henry  of  Navarr  till he had satisfy'd the Nobility and People in the point of Religion And tho I do not know that the Letter upon the words  Vae regno  Lamb Leg Saxon  cujus Rex p  er est  recited by  Lambard  was written by  Eleutherius  Bishop of  Rome  yet the Authority given to it by the  Saxons  who made it a Law is much more to be valu'd than what it could receive from the Writer And whoever he was he seems rightly to have understood  Solomon  's meaning who did not look upon him as a Child that wanted years or was superannuated but him only who was guilty of Insolence Luxury Folly and Madness and he that said  A wise Child was better than an old and foolish King  could have no other meaning unless he should say it was worse to be govern'd by a wise Person than a Fool which may agree with the judgment of our Author but could never enter into the heart of  Solomon  Lastly Tho the practice of one or more Nations may indicate what Laws Covenants or Customs were in force among them yet they cannot bind others The diversity of them proceeds from the variety of mens Judgments and declares that the direction of all such Affairs depends upon their own Will according to which every People for themselves do form and measure the Magistracy and magistratical Power which as it is directed solely for the good has its exercises and extent proportionable to the Command of those that institute it and such Ordinances being good for men God makes them his own  SECT VIII There is no natural propensity in Man or Beast to Monarchy  I SEE no reason to believe that God did approve the Government of one over many because he created but one but to the contrary in as much he did endow him and those that came from him as well the youngest as the eldest Line with understanding to provide for themselves and by the invention of Arts and Sciences to be beneficial to each other he shew'd that they ought to make use of that understanding in forming Governments according to their own convenience and such occasions as should arise as well as in other matters And it might as well be infer'd that it is unlawful for us to build clothe arm defend or nourish our selves otherwise than our first Parents did before or soon after the Flood as to take from us the liberty of instituting Governments that were not known to them If they did not find out all that conduces to the use of man but a Faculty as well as a Liberty was left to every one and will be to the end of the World to make use of his Wit Industry and Experience according to present Exigences to invent and practise such things as seem convenient to himself and others in matters of the least importance it were absurd to imagin that the political Science which of all  others is the most abstruse and variable according to Accidents and Circumstances should have bin perfectly known to them who had no use of it and that their Descendents are oblig'd to add nothing to what they practis'd But the reason given by our Author to prove this extravagant fancy is yet more ridiculous than the thing it self  God  says he  shew'd his opinion  viz that all should be govern'd by one  when he endow'd not only Men but Beasts with a natural propensity to Monarchy Neither can it be doubted but a natural propensity is refer'd to God who is the Author of Nature  Which I suppose may appear if it be consider'd  Nevertheless I cannot but commend him in the first place for introducing God speaking so modestly not declaring his Will but his Opinion He puts haughty and majestick Language into the mouth of Kings They command and decide as if they were subject to no Error and their Will ought to be taken for perpetual Laws but to God he ascribes an humble delivery of his Opinion only as if he fear'd to be mistaken In the second place I deny that there is any such general propensity in Man or Beast or that Monarchy would thereby be justify'd tho it were found in them It cannot be in Beasts for they know not what Government is and being uncapable of it cannot distinguish the several sorts nor consequently incline to one more than another  Salmasius  his story of Bees is only fit for old Women to prate of in Chimnycorners and they who represent Lions and Eagles as Kings of Birds and Beasts do it only to show that their Power is nothing but brutish Violence exercis'd in the destruction of all that are not able to oppose it and that has nothing of goodness or justice in it which Similitude tho it should prove to be in all respects adequate to the matter in question could only shew that those who have no sense of Right Reason or Religion have a natural propensity to make use of their strength to the destruction of such as are weake  than they and not that any are willing to submit or not to resist it if they can which I think will be of no great advantage to Monarchy But whatever propensity may be in Beasts it cannot be attributed generally to Men for if it were they never could have deviated from it unless they were violently put out of their natural course which in this case cannot be for there is no Power to force them But that they have most frequently deviated appears by the various Forms of Government establish'd by them There is therefore no natural propensity to any one but they chuse that which in their judgment seems best for them Or if he would have that inconsiderate impulse by which brutish and ignorant men may be sway'd when they know no better to pass for a Propensity others are no more oblig'd to follow it than to live upon Acorns or inhabit hollow Trees because their Fathers did it when they had no better dwellings and found no better nourishment in the uncultivated World And he that exhibits such Examples as far as in him lies endeavours to take from us the use of Reason and extinguishing the light of it to make us live like the worst of Beasts that we may be fit Subjects to absolute Monarchy This may perhaps be our Author's intention having learn'd from  Aristotle  that such a Government is only sutable to the nature of the most bestial men who being uncapable of governing themselves fall under the Power of such as will take the conduct of 'em But he ought withal to have remember'd that according to  Aristotle  's opinion this Conductor must be in nature different from those he takes the charge of and if he be not there can be no Government nor Order by which it subsists Beasts follow Beasts and the blind lead the blind to destruction  But tho I should grant this Propensity to be general it could not be imputed to God since man by Sin is fallen from the Law of his Creation  The wickedness of man  even in the first Ages  was great in the World All the imaginations of his heart are evil and that continually All men are liars There is none that doth good no not one Out of the heart proceed evil Thoughts Murders Adulterys Fornications Thefts false Testimonys  c These are the Fruits of our corrupted nature which the Apostle observing dos not only make a difference between the natural and the spiritual Man whose proceeding only can be refer'd to God and that only so far as he is guided by his Spirit but shews that the natural man is in a perpetual enmity against God without any possibility of being reconcil'd to him unless by the destruction of the old Man and the regenerating or renewing him thro the Spirit of Grace There being no footsteps of this in our Author's Book he and his Master  Heylin  may have differ'd from the Apostle referring that Propensity of Nature to God which he declares to be utter enmity against him and we may conclude that this Propensity however general it may be cannot be attributed to God as the Author of Nature since it cannot be more general than the Corruptions into which we are fallen  SECT IX The Government instituted by God over the  Israelites  was Aristocratical  NOtwithstanding all this our Author is resolv'd that Monarchy must be from God  What form of Government  says he  God ordain'd by his Authority may be gather'd by that Commonwealth which he instituted amongst the  Hebrews  which was not Aristocratical as  Calvin  says but plainly Monarchical  I may in as few words deny the Government set up by God to have bin Monarchical as he asserts it but finding such Language ordinarily to proceed from a mixture of folly impudence and pride I chuse rather to shew upon what I ground my Opinions than nakedly to deliver them most especially when by insisting upon the Government instituted by God over his People he refers us to the Scripture And I do this the more boldly since I follow  Calvin  's Exposition and believe that he having bin highly esteem'd for his Wit Judgment and Learning by such as were endow'd with the like and reverenc'd as a glorious Servant of God might if he were now alive comfort himself tho he had the misfortune to fall under the censures of  Filmer  and his followers 'Tis probable he gave some Reasons for his Opinions but our Author having maliciously conceal'd 'em and I not having leasure at present to examin all his Writings to find 'em must content my self with such as my small understanding may suggest and such as I have found in approved Authors  In the first place I may safely say he was not alone of that opinion  Josephus Philo  and  Moses Maimonides  with all the best of the Jewish and Christian Authors had long before deliver'd the same  Josephus  o  Ant Jud  says that  Saul  's first Sin by which he fell was  that he took away the Aristocracy  which he could not do if it had never bin establish'd  Philo  imputes the institution of Kingly Government as it was in  Israel  neither  to God nor his Word but to the fury of the sinful People  Abarbenel  says it proceeded from their delight in the Idolatry to which their  Abar in Sam  Neighbours were addicted and which could be upheld only by a Government in practice and principle contrary to that which God had instituted  Maimonides  frequently says the same thing grounded upon the  Maim MoreNevochim  words of  Hosea I gave them Kings in my Wrath  and whosoever will call that a divine Institution may give the same name to Plagues or Famines and induce a necessity incumbent upon all men to go and search the one where they may find it and to leave their Lands for ever uncultivated that they may be sure of the other which being too bestial to be asserted by a man I may safely say the  Hebrew  Kings were not instituted by God but given as a punishment of their Sin who despis'd the Government he had instituted and the abovemention'd Authors agree in the same thing calling the Peoples desire to have a King furious mad wicked and proceeding from their love to the Idolatry of their Neighbours which was suted to their Government both which were inconsistent with what God had establish'd over his own People  But waving the opinions of men 'tis good to see what we can learn from the Scripture and inquire if there be any Precept there expresly commanding them to make a King or any Example that they did so whilst they continu'd obedient to the Word of God or any thing from whence we may reasonably infer they ought to have done it all which if I mistake not will be found directly contrary  The only Precept that we find in the Law concerning Kings is that of  Deut  already mention'd and that is not a Command to the People to make but Instructions what manner of King they should make if they desir'd to have one There was therefore none at all  Examples do as little favour our Author's Assertions  Moses Joshua  and the other Judges had not the name or power of Kings They were not of the Tribe to which the Scepter was promis'd They did not transmit the Power they had to their Children which in our Adversary's opinion is a Right inseparable from Kings and their Power was not continu'd by any kind of Succession but created occasionally as need requir'd according to the Vertues discover'd in those who were rais'd by God to deliver the Nation in the time of their distress which being done their Children lay hid among the rest of the People Thus were  Ehud Gideon Jephtha  and others set up  Whosoever will give battel  say the Princes  Judg    and People of  Gilead to the Children of  Ammon  shall be head over the Inheritance of  Gilead and finding  Jephtha  to be such a man as they sought they made him their Chief and all  Israel  follow'd them When  Othniel  had shew'd his Valour in taking  Kiriath Sepher  and delivering his Brethren from  CushanRishathaim  he was made Judg When  Ehud  had kill'd  Eglon  when  Shamgar  and  Samson  had destroy'd great numbers of the  Philistins  and when  Gideon  had defeated the  Midianites  they were sit to be advanc'd above their Brethren These Dignitys were not inherent in their Persons or Familys but confer'd upon them nor confer'd that they might be exalted in Riches and Glory but that they might be Ministers of Good to the People This may justify  Plato  's opinion that if one man be found incomparably to excel all others in the Vertues that are beneficial to Civil Societys he ought to be advanc'd above all but I think it will be hard from thence to deduce an Argument in favour of such a Monarchy as is necessarily to descend to the next in Blood whether Man Woman or Child without any consideration of  Vertue Age Sex or Ability and that failing it can be of no use to our Author But whatever the dignity of a  Hebrew  Judg was and howsoever he was rais'd to that Office it certainly differ'd from that of a King  Gideon  could not have refus'd to be a King when the People would have made him so if he had bin a King already or that God from the beginning had appointed they should have one The Elders and People  Sam  could not have ask'd a King of  Samuel  if he had bin King and he could not without impiety have bin displeas'd with them for asking such a one as God had appointed neither would God have said to him  They have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them  if he had ordain'd what they desir'd  They did not indeed reject God with their Mouths They pretended to use the liberty he had given them to make a King but would have such a one as he had forbidden They drew near to him with their Lips but their Hearts were far from him and he seeing their Hypocrisy severely chastis'd 'em in granting their ill conceiv'd request and foretold the Miserys that should thereupon befal 'em from which he would not deliver 'em tho they should cry to him by reason of what they suffer'd from their King▪ He was their Creature and the mischiefs thereby brought upon them were the fruits of their own labour  This is that which our Author calls God's institution of Kings but the  Hos  Prophet explains the matter much better  I gave them Kings in my anger and took them away in my wrath  in destroying them God brought desolation upon the people that had sinn'd in asking for them and following their example in all kind of Wickedness This is all that our Author has to boast of but God who acknowledges those works only to be his own which proceed from his goodness and mercy to his People disowns this  Hos  Israel hath cast off the thing that is good  even the Government that he had establish'd  the Enemy shall pursue him They have set up Kings but not by me and Princes but I know them not  As if he sought to justify the severity of his Judgments brought upon them by the wickedness of their Kings that they not he had ordain'd  Having seen what Government God did not ordain it may be seasonable to examin the Nature of the Government which he did ordain and we shall easily find that it consisted of three parts besides the Magistrats of the several Tribes and Citys They had a chief Magistrat who was  Numb  call'd Judg or Captain as  Joshua Gideon  and others a Council of seventy chosen men and the General Assemblys of the People  The first was merely occasional like to the Dictators of  Rome  and as the  Romans  in times of danger frequently chose such a Man as was much esteem'd for Valour and Wisdom God's peculiar People had a peculiar regard to that Wisdom and Valour which was accompanied with his Presence hoping for deliverance only from him  The second is known by the name of the Great  Sanhedrin  which being instituted by  Moses  according to the command of God continu'd till they were all save one slain by  Herod  And the third part which is the Assembly of the People was so common that none can be ignorant of it but such as never look'd into the Scripture When the Tribes of  Reuben Gad  and half that of  Manasseh  had built an Altar on the side of  Jordan  Josh  The whole Congregation of the Children of  Israel  gather'd together at  Shiloh  to go up to war against them and sent  Phineas  the Son of  Eleazer  and with him ten Princes  c This was the highest and most important action that could concern a People even War or Peace and that not  with Strangers but their own Brethren  Joshua  was then alive The Elders never fail'd yet this was not transacted by him or them but by the collected body of the People  for They sent Phineas  This Democratical Embassy was Democratically receiv'd It was not directed to one Man but to all the Children of  Reuben Gad  and  Manasseh  and the Answer was sent by them all which being pleasing to  Phineas  and the ten that were with him they made their report to the Congregation and all was quiet  The last eminent Act perform'd by  Joshua  was the calling of a like Assembly to  Shechem  compos'd of Elders Heads of Familys Judges Officers  Jos  and all the People to whom he propos'd and they agreeing made a Covenant before the Lord  Joshua  being dead the Proceedings of every Tribe were grounded upon Counsels taken at such Assemblys among themselves for their own concerns as appears by the Actions of  Judah Simeon  c against the  Canaanites  and when the  Levite  complain'd that his Wife had bin forc'd  Judg  by those of  Gibeah  the whole Congregation of  Israel  met together at  Mispeth  from all parts  even from  Dan  to  Beersheba as one man and there resolv'd upon that terrible War which they made against the Tribe of  Benjamin  The like Assembly was gather'd together for the election of  Saul  every man was there and tho the Elders only are said to have ask'd a King of  Samuel  they seem to have bin deputed from the whole Congregation for God said  Hearken to the Voice of the People  In the  Sam  same manner the Tribe of  Judah  and after that the rest chose and anointed  David  to be their King After the death of  Solomon  all  Israel  met together to treat with  Rehoboam  and not receiving satisfaction from him ten of the Tribes abrogated his Kingdom  If these Actions were consider'd singly by themselves  Calvin  might have given the name of a Democracy to the Hebrew Government as well as to that of  Athens  for without doubt they evidently manifest the supreme Power to have bin in the supreme manner in these General Assemblys but the Government as to its outward order consisting of those three parts which comprehend the three simple  species  and no times having bin appointed nor occasions specify'd upon which Judges should be chosen or these Assemblys call'd whereas the  Sanhedrim  which was the Aristocratical part was permanent the whole might rightly be call'd an Aristocracy that part prevailing above the others and tho  Josephus  calls it a Theocracy by reason of God's presence with his People yet in relation to man he calls it an Aristocracy and says that  Saul  's first Sin by which he fell from the Kingdom was that  Gubernationem optimatum sustulit  which could not be if they were govern'd by a Monarch before he was chosen  Our Author taking no notice of these matters first endeavours to prove the excellency of Monarchy from natural instinct and then begging the question says that God did always govern his People by Monarchy whereas he ought in the first place to have observ'd that this instinct if there be any such thing is only an irrational appetite attributed to Beasts that know not why they do any thing and is to be follow'd only by those men who being equally irrational live in the same ignorance and the second being prov'd to be absolutely false by the express words of the Scripture  There was then no King in  Israel several  Judg  times repeated and the whole series of the History he has no other evasion than to say  That even then the  Israelites  were under the  Kingly Government of the Fathers of particular Familys  It appears by the foremention'd Text cited also by our Author that in the Assembly of the People gather'd together to take counsel concerning the War against  Benjamin  were four hundred thousand Footmen that drew Sword They all arose together saying Not a man of us shall go to his Tent  So all the men of  Israel  were gather'd together against the City  This is repeated several times in the relation The  Benjamites  proceeded in the like manner in preparing for their defence and if all these who did so meet to consult and determin were Monarchs there were then in  Israel  and  Benjamin  four hundred twenty six thousand seven hundred Monarchs or Kings tho the Scripture says there was not one  If yet our Author insists upon his notion of Kingly Government I desire to know who were the Subjects if all these were Kings for the Text says that the  whole Congregation was gather'd together as one man from  Dan  to  Beersheba If there can be so many Kings without one Subject what becomes of the Right of  Abraham Isaac  and  Jacob  that was to have bin devolv'd upon one Man as Heir to them and thereby Lord of all If every man had an equal part in that inheritance and by virtue of it became a King why is not the same eternally subdivided to as many men as are in the World who are also Kings If this be their natural condition how comes it to be alter'd till they dethrone themselves by consent to set up one or more to have a power over them all Why should they devest themselves of their natural Right to set up one above themselves unless in consideration of their own good If the Kings might retain the power in themselves or give it to one why might they not give it to any such number of men as should best please themselves or retain it in their own hands as they did till the days of  Saul  or frame limit and direct it according to their own pleasure If this be true God is the Author of Democracy and no assertor of human Liberty did ever claim more than the People of God did enjoy and exercise at the time when our Author says they were under the Kingly Government which Liberty being not granted by any peculiar concession or institution the same must belong to all Mankind  'Tis in vain to say the men were heads of Familys for the Scripture only says  They were Footmen that drew the Sword  or rather all the men of  Israel  from  Dan  to  Beersheba  who were able to make War When six hundred  Benjamites  did only remain of the 'tis plain that no more were left of that Tribe their Women and Children having bin destroy'd in the Citys after their defeat The next Chapter makes the matter yet more plain for when all that were at the Congregation in  Mispeth  were found to have sworn they would not give their Daughters to any of the Tribe of  Benjamin  no  Israelite  was free from the Oath but  J  dg    the men of  Jabesh Gilead  who had not bin at the Assembly All the rest of  Israel  was therefore comprehended and they continuing to govern in a popular way with absolute power sent twelve thousand of their most valiant men to destroy all the Males of  Jabesh Gilead  and the Women that had lain by Man reserving the Virgins for the  Benjamites  This is enough for my purpose for the question is not concerning the power that every Housholder in  London  has over his Wife Children and Servants but whether they are all perpetually subject to one man and Family and I intend not to set up their Wives Prentices and Children against them or to diminish their Rights but to assert them as the gift of God and Nature no otherwise to be restrain'd than by Laws made with their own consent  Reason failing our Author pleases himself with terms of his own Invention  When the People beg'd a King of  Samuel  they were govern'd by a Kingly power God out of a special love and care to the House of  Israel  did chuse to be their King himself and did govern them at that time by his Viceroy  Samuel  and his Sons  The behaviour of the  Israelites  towards  Samuel  has bin thought proud perverse and obstinate but the fine Courtword  begging  was never before apply'd to them and their insolent fury was not only seen against  Samuel  but against God  They have not rejected thee  Sam  but they have rejected me  And I think  Filmer  is the first who ever found that Beggars in begging did reject him of whom they beg'd Or if they were Beggars they were such as would not be denied for after all that  Samuel  had said to dissuade them from their wicked design they said  Nay but we will have a King  Ver  But lest I should be thought too much inclin'd to contradict our Author I confess that once he has happen'd to be in the right  God out of a special love to the House of  Israel  chose to be their King He gave them Laws prescrib'd a Form of Government rais'd up Men in a wonderful manner to execute it fill'd them with his Spirit was ever present when they call'd upon him He gave them counsel in their doubts and assistance in all their extremitys He made a Covenant with them and would be exalted by them  But what is this to an earthly Monarch Who can from hence derive a Right to any one man to play the Lord over his Brethren or a reason why any Nation should set him up God is our Lord by right of creation and our only Lord because he only has created us If any other were equal to him in Wisdom Power Goodness and Beneficence to us he might challenge the same duty from us If growing out of our selves receiving being from none depending on no providence we were offer'd the protection of a Wisdom subject to no error a Goodness that could never fail and a Power that nothing could resist it were reasonable for us to enter into a Covenant submit our selves to him and with all the facultys of our minds to addict our selves to his Service But what Right can from hence accrue to a mortal Creature like to one of us from whom we have receiv'd nothing and who stands in need of help as much as we Who can from hence deduce an argument to persuade us to depend upon his Wisdom who has as little as other men To submit to his Will who is subject to the same Frailtys Passions and Vices with the rest of Mankind Or to expect protection and defence from him whose life depends upon as slender threds as our own and who can have no power but that which we confer upon him If this cannot be done but is of all things the most contrary to common sense no man can in himself have any right over us we are all as free as the four hundred twenty six thousand seven hundred Hebrew Kings We can naturally owe allegiance to none and I doubt whether all the lusts that have reign'd amongst Men since the beginning of the World have brought more guilt and misery upon them than that preposterous and impudent pretence of imitating what God had instituted When  Saul  set himself most violently to oppose the command of God he pretended to fulfil it When the  Jews  grew weary of God's Government and resolv'd to reject him that he should not reign over them they us'd some of  Moses  his words and ask'd that King of God whom they intended to set up against him But this King had not bin set up against God the People had not rejected God and sin'd in asking for him if every Nation by a general Law ought to have one or by a particular Law one had bin  appointed by him over them There was therefore no King amongst them nor any Law of God or Nature particular or general according to which they ought to have one  SECT X  Aristotle  was not simply for Monarchy or against Popular Government but approv'd or disapprov'd of either according to circumstances  OUR Author well observes that  Aristotle  is hardly brought to give a general opinion in favour of Monarchy as if it were the best form of Government or to say true never dos it He uses much caution proposes conditions and limitations and makes no decision but according to circumstances Men of Wisdom and Learning are subject to such doubts but none ought to wonder if stupidity and ignorance defend  Filmer  and his Followers from them or that their hatred to the antient Vertue should give 'em an aversion to the Learning that was the Nurse of it Those who neither understand the several Species of Government nor the various Tempers of Nations may without fear or shame give their opinions in favour of that which best pleases them but wise men will always proportion their praises to the merit of the Subject and never commend that simply which is good only according to circumstances  Aristotle  highly applauds Monarchy when the Monarch has more of those Vertues that tend to the good of a Commonwealth than all they who compose it This is the King mention'd in his  Ethicks  and extol'd in his  Politicks  He is above all by Nature and ought not by a municipal Law to be made equal to others in Power He ought to govern because 'tis better for a People to be govern'd by him than to enjoy their Liberty or rather they do enjoy their Liberty which is never more safe than when defended by one who is a living Law to himself and others Wheresoever such a man appears he ought to reign He bears in his Person the Divine Character of a Sovereign God has rais'd him above all and such as will not submit to him ought to be accounted Sons of  Belial  brought forth and slain But he dos withal confess that if no such man be found there is no natural King All the Prerogatives belonging to him vanish for want of one who is capable of enjoying them He lays severe Censures upon those who not being thus qualified take upon them to govern men equal to or better than themselves and judges the assumption of such Powers by persons not naturally adapted to the administration of them as barbarous Usurpations which no Law or Reason can justify and is not so much transported with the excellency of this true King as not to  A  t  o  t  confess he ought to be limited by Law  Qui legem praeesse jubet videtur jubere praeesse Deum Leges qui autem hominem praeesse jubet adjungit bestiam libido quippe talis est atque obliquos agit etiam viros optimos qui sunt in pot  state ex quo mens atque appetitus Lex est  This agrees with the words of the best King that is known to have bin in the world proceeding as is most probable from a sense of the Passions that reign'd in his own breast  Man being in honour has no understanding but is like to the beast that perishes  This shews that such as deny that Kings do reign  by Law or that Laws may be put upon Kings do equally set themselves against the opinions of wise Men and the Word of God and our Author having found that Learning made the  Grecians  seditious may reasonably doubt that Religion may make others worse so as none will be fit Subjects of his applauded Government but those who have neither Religion nor Learning and that it cannot be introduc'd till both be extinguish'd  Aristotle  having declar'd his mind concerning Government in the Books expresly written on that Subject whatsoever is said by the by in his Moral Discourses must be refer'd to and interpreted by the other And if he said which I do not find that Monarchy is the best Form of Government and a Popular State the worst he cannot be thought to have meant otherwise than that those Nations were the most happy who had such a Man as he thinks fit to be made a Monarch and those the most unhappy who neither had such a one nor a few that any way excel'd the rest but all being equally brutish must take upon 'em the Government they were unable to manage for he dos no where admit any other end of Just and Civil Government than the good of the Governed nor any advantage due to one or a few persons unless for such Vertues as conduce to the common good of the Society And as our Author thinks Learning makes men seditious  Aristotle  also acknowledges that those who have Understanding and Courage which may be taken for Learning or the effect of it will never endure the Government of one or a few that do not excel them in Vertue but no where dispraises a Popular Government unless the Multitude be compos'd of such as are barbarous stupid leud vicious and uncapable of the Happiness for which Governments are instituted who cannot live to themselves but like a herd of Beasts must be brought under the dominion of another or who having among themselves such an excellent Person as is above describ'd will not submit to him but either kill banish or bring him to be equal with others whom God had made to excel all I do not trouble my self or the Reader with citing here and there a Line out of his Books but refer my self to those who have perus'd his Moral and Political Writings submitting to the severest Censures if this be not the true Sense of 'em and that Vertue alone in his opinion ought to give the preheminence And as  Aristotle  following the wise Men of those times shews us how far Reason improv'd by Meditation can advance in the knowledge and love of that which is truly good so we may in  Filmer  guided by  Heylin  see an Example of corrupted Christians who extinguishing the Light of Religion by their Vices and degenerating into Beasts whilst they endeavour to support the personal Interest of some men who are rais'd to Dignitys by the consent of Nations or by unwarrantable ways and means would cast all the Power into the hands of such as happen to be born in certain Familys as if Governments had not bin instituted for the common good of Nations but only to increase their Pride and foment their Vices or that the care and direction of a great People were so easy a work that every Man Woman or Child how young weak foolish or wicked soever may be worthy of it and able to manage it  SECT XI Liberty produces Vertue Order and Stability Slavery is accompanied with Vice Weakness and Misery  OUR Author's judgment as well as inclinations to Vertue are manifested in the preference he gives to the manners of the  Assyrians  and other Eastern Nations before the  Grecians  and  Romans  Whereas the first were never remarkable for any thing but Pride Leudness Treachery Cruelty Cowardice Madness and hatred to all that is good whilst the others excel'd in Wisdom Valour and all the Vertues that deserve imitation This was so well observ'd by St  Augustin  that  De Civ Dei  he brings no stronger Argument to prove that God leaves nothing that is good in man unrewarded than that he gave the dominion of the best part of the World to the  Romans  who in moral Vertues excel'd all other Nations And I think no Example can be alledg'd of a Free People that has ever bin conquer'd by an Absolute Monarch unless he did incomparably surpass them in Riches and Strength whereas many great Kings have bin overthrown by small Republicks and the success being constantly the same it cannot be attributed to Fortune but must necessarily be the production of Vertue and good Order  Machiavel  discoursing of these matters finds Vertue to be so essentially necessary to the establishment and preservation of Liberty that he thinks it impossible for a corrupted People to set up a good Government or for a Tyranny to be introduc'd if they be vertuous and makes this  Si puo far questa conclusione che dove la materia non e corrotta i tumulti ed altri scandali non nuocono là dove la e corrotta le buone Leggi non giovano  Machiav  Disc sopra  T Livio  lib  Conclusion  That where the Matter  that is the body of the People  is not corrupted Tumults and Disorders do no hurt and where it is corrupted good Laws do no good  Which being confirm'd by Reason and Experience I think no wise man has ever contradicted him  But I do not more wonder that  Filmer  should look upon Absolute Monarchy to be the Nurse of Vertue tho we see they did never subsist together than that he should attribute Order and Stability to it whereas Order principally consists in appointing to every one his right Place Office or Work and he lays the whole weight of the Government upon one Person who very often dos neither deserve nor is able to bear the least part of it  Plato Aristotle Hooker  and I may say in short all wise men have held that Order requir'd that the wisest best and most valiant should be plac'd in the Offices where Wisdom Vertue and Valour are requisit If common sense did not teach us this we might learn it from the Scripture When God gave the conduct of his People to  Moses Joshua Samuel  and others he endow'd them with all the Vertues and Graces requir'd for the right performance of their Duty When the  Israelites  were opprest by the  Midianites Philistins  and  Ammonites  they expected help from the most vise and valiant When  Hannibal  was at the Gates of  Rome  and had fill'd  Italy  with Fire and Blood or when the  Gauls  overwhelm'd that Country with their multitudes and fury the Senat and People of  Rome  put themselves under the conduct of  Camillus  Manlius Fabius Scipio  and the like and when they fail'd to chuse such as were fit for the work to be done they receiv'd such defeats as convinc'd 'em of their Error But if our Author say true Order requir'd that the Power of defending the Country should have bin annex'd as an Inheritance to one Family or left to him that could get it and the exercise of all Authority committed to the next in Blood tho the weakest of Women or the basest of Men  The like may be said of judging or doing of Justice and 'tis absurd to pretend that either is expected from the Power not the Person of the Monarch for experience dos too well shew how much all things halt in relation to Justice or Defence when there is a defect in him that ought to judg us and to fight our Battels But of all things this ought least to be alledg'd by the Advocats for absolute Monarchy who deny that the Authority can be separated from the Person and lay it as a fundamental Principle that whosoever has it may do what he pleases and be accountable to no man  Our Author's next work is to shew that Stability is the effect of this good Order but he ought to have known that Stability is then only worthy of praise when it is in that which is good No man delights in sickness or pain because it is long or incurable nor in slavery and misery because it is perpetual much less will any man in his senses commend a permanency in vice and wickedness He must therefore prove that the Stability he boasts of is in things that are good or all that he says of it signifies nothing  I might leave him here with as little fear that any man who shall espouse his Quarrel will ever be able to remove this Obstacle as that he himself should rise out of his Grave and do it But I hope to prove that of all things under the Sun there is none more mutable or unstable than absolute Monarchy which is all that I dispute against professing much veneration for that which is mix'd regulated by Law and directed to the Publick Good  This might be prov'd by many Arguments but I shall confine my self to two the one drawn from Reason the other from matters of Fact  Nothing can be call'd stable that is not so in Principle and Practice in which respect human Nature is not well capable of Stability but the utmost deviation from it that can be imagin'd is when such an Error is laid for a Foundation as can never be corrected All will confess that if there be any stability in man it must be in Wisdom and Vertue and in those Actions that are thereby directed for in weakness folly and madness there can be none The Stability therefore that we seek in relation to the exercise of Civil and Military Powers can never be found unless care be taken that such as exercise those Powers be endow'd with the Qualitys that should make them stable This is utterly repugnant to our Author's Doctrin He lays for a Foundation That the Succession goes to the next in Blood without distinction of Age Sex or personal Qualitys whereas even he himself could not have the impudence to say that Children and Women where they are admitted or Fools Madmen and such as are full of all wickedness do not come to be the Heirs of reigning Familys as well as of the meanest The Stability therefore that can be expected from such a Government either depends upon those who have none in themselves or is refer'd wholly to Chance which is directly opposite to Stability  This would be the case tho it were as we say an even Wager whether the Person would be fit or unfit and that there were as many men in the world able as unable to perform the Duty of a King but Experience shewing that among many millions of men there is hardly one that possesses the Qualitys requir'd in a King 'tis so many to one that he upon whom the Lot shall fall will not be the man we seek in whose Person and Government there can be such a stability as is asserted And that failing all must necessarily fail for there can be no stability in his Will Laws or Actions who has none in his Person  That we may see whether this be verify'd by Experience we need not search into the dark relations of the  Babylonian  and  Assyrian  Monarchys Those rude Ages afford us little instruction and tho the fragments of History remaining do sufficiently show that all things there were in perpetual fluctuation by reason of the madness of their Kings and the violence of those who transported the Empire from one Place or Family to another I will not much rely upon them but slightly touching some of their Storys pass to those that are better known to us  The Kings of those Ages seem to have liv'd rather like Beasts in a Forest than Men join'd in Civil Society they follow'd the Example of  Nimrod  the mighty Hunter Force was the only Law that prevail'd the stronger devour'd the weaker and continu'd in Power till ejected by one of more strength or better fortune By this means the race of  Ninus  was destroy'd by  Belochus Arbaces  rent the Kingdom asunder and took  Media  to himself  Morodach  extinguish'd the Race of  Belochus  and was made King  Nabuchodonosor  like a Flood overwhelm'd all for a time destroy'd the Kingdoms of  Jerusalem  and  Egypt  with many others and found no obstacle till his rage and pride turn'd to a most bestial madness And the  Assyrian  Empire was wholly abolish'd at the death of his Grandchild  Belshazzar  and no Stability can be found in the reigns of those great Kings unless that name be given to the Pride Idolatry Cruelty and Wickedness in which they remain'd constant If we examin matters more distinctly we shall find that all things vari'd according to the humour of the Prince Whilst  Pharaoh  liv'd who had receiv'd many signal Services from  Joseph  the  Israelites  were well us'd but when another rose up who knew him not they were persecuted with all the extremitys of Injustice and Cruelty till the furious King persisting in his design of exterminating them brought destruction upon himself and the Nation Where the like Power has prevail'd it has ever produc'd the like effects When some great men of  Persia  had persuaded  Darius  that it was a fine thing to command that no man for the space of thirty days should make any Petition to God or Man but to the King only  Daniel  the most wise and holy Man then in the world must be thrown to the Lions When God    had miraculously sav'd him the same Sentence was pass'd against the Princes of the Nation When  Haman  had fill'd  Ahasuerus  his ears with Lies all the  Jews  were appointed to be slain and when the fraud of that Villain was detected leave was given them with the like precipitancy to kill whom they pleas'd When the  Israelites  came to have Kings they were subject to the same Storms and always with their Blood suffer'd the Penalty of their Princes madness When one kind of Fury possest  Saul  he slew the Priests persecuted  David  and would have kill'd his brave Son  Jonathan  When he fell under another he took upon him to do the Priest's Office pretended to understand the Word of God better than  Samuel  and spar'd those that God had commanded him to destroy  Upon another whimsy he kill'd the  Gibeonites  and never rested from finding new Inventions to vex the People till he had brought many thousands of them to perish with himself and his Sons on Mount  Gilboa  We do not find any King in Wisdom Valour and Holiness equal to  David  and yet he falling under the temptations that attend the greatest Fortunes brought Civil Wars and a Plague upon the Nation When  Solomon  's heart was drawn away by strange Women he fill'd the Land with Idols and opprest the People with intolerable Tributes  Rehoboam  's Folly made that Rent in the Kingdom which could never be made up Under his Successors the people serv'd God  Baal  or  Ashtaroth  as best pleas'd him who had the Power and no other marks of Stability can be alledg'd to have bin in that Kingdom than the constancy of their Kings in the practice of Idolatry their cruelty to the Prophets hatred to the  Jews  and civil Wars producing such Slaughters as are reported in few other Storys The Kingdom was in the space of about two hundred years possest by nine several Familys not one of 'em getting possession otherwise than by the slaughter of his Predecessor and the extinction of his Race and ended in the Bondage of the ten Tribes which continues to this day  He that desires farther proofs of this Point may seek 'em in the Historys of  Alexander  of  Macedon  and his Successors He seems to have bin endow'd with all the Vertues that Nature improv'd by Disciplin did ever attain so that he is believ'd to be the man meant by  Aristotle  who on account of the excellency of his Vertues was by Nature fram'd for a King and  Plutarch  ascribes his Conquests rather to those than to his Fortune  Plut in Vic Alex  But even that Vertue was overthrown by the Successes that accompanied it He burnt the most magnificent Palace of the world in a frolick to please a mad drunken Whore Upon the most frivolous suggestions of Eunuchs and Rascals he kill'd the best and bravest of his Friends and his Valour which had no equal not subsisting without his other Vertues perish'd when he became leud proud cruel and superstitious so as it may be truly said he died a Coward His Successors did not differ from him When they had kill'd his Mother Wife and Children they exercis'd their fury against one another and tearing the Kingdom to pieces the Survivors left the Sword as an Inheritance to their Familys who perish'd by it or under the weight of the  Roman  Chains  When the  Romans  had lost that Liberty which had bin the Nurse of their Vertue and gain'd the Empire in lieu of it they attain'd to our Author's applauded Stability  Julius  being slain in the Senat the first Question was whether it could be restor'd or not And that being decided by the Battel of  Philippi  the Conquerors set themselves to destroy all the eminent men in the City as the best means to establish the Monarchy  Augustus  gain'd it by the death of  Antonius  and the corruption of the Soldiers and he dying naturally or by the fraud of his Wife the Empire was transfer'd to her Son  Tiberius  under whom the miserable People suffer'd the worst effects of the most impure Lust and inhuman Cruelty He being stifled the Government went on with much uniformity and stability  Caligula Claudius Nero Galba Otho Vitellius  regularly and constantly did all the mischief they could and were not more like to each other in the Villanys they committed than in the Deaths they suffer'd  Vespasian  's more gentle Reign did no way compensate the Blood he spilt to attain the Empire And the Benefits receiv'd from  Titus  his short liv'd Vertue were infinitly overbalanc'd by the detestable  Vices of his Brother  Domitian  who turn'd all things into the old Channel of Cruelty Lust Rapine and Perfidiousness His slaughter gave a little breath to the gasping perishing World and men might be vertuous under the Government of  Nerva Trajan Antoninus Aurelius  and a few more tho even in their time Religion was always dangerous But when the Power fell into the hands of  Commodus Heliogabalus Caracalla  and others of that sort nothing was safe but obscurity or the utmost excesses of leudness and baseness However whilst the Will of the Governor pass'd for a Law and the Power did usually fall into the hands of such as were most bold and violent the utmost security that any man could have for his Person or Estate depended upon his temper and Princes themselves whether good or bad had no longer Leases of their lives than the furious and corrupted Soldiers would give them and the Empire of the World was changeable according to the Success of a Battel  Matters were not much mended when the Emperors became Christians Some favour'd those who were call'd  Orthodox  and gave great Revenues to corrupt the Clergy Others supported  Arianism  and persecuted the Orthodox with as much asperity as the Pagans had done Some revolted and shew'd themselves more fierce against the professors of Christianity than they that had never had any knowledg of it The World was torn in pieces amongst them and often suffer'd as great miserys by their sloth ignorance and co wardice as by their fury and madness till the Empire was totally dissolv'd and lost That which under the weakness and irregularity of a popular Government had conquer'd all from the  Euphrates  to  Britain  and destroy'd the Kingdoms of  Asia Egypt Macedon Numidia  and a multitude of others was made a Prey to unknown barbarous Nations and rent into as many pieces as it had bin compos'd of when it enjoy'd the Stability that accompanys Divine and Absolute Monarchy  The like may be said of all the Kingdoms in the World they may have their ebbings and flowings according to the Vertues or Vices of Princes or their Favorites but can never have any Stability because there is and can be none in them Or if any Exception may be brought against this Rule it must be of those Monarchys only which are mix'd and regulated by Laws where Diets Parliaments Assemblys of Estates or Senats may supply the defects of a Prince restrain him if he prove extravagant and reject such as are found to be unworthy of their Office which are as odious to our Author and his Followers as the most popular Governments and can be of no advantage to his Cause  There is another ground of perpetual Fluctuation in Absolute Monarchys or such as are grown so strong that they cannot be restrain'd by Law tho according to their Institution they ought to be distinct from but in some measure relating to the Inclinations of the Monarch that is the impulse of Ministers Favorites Wives or Whores who frequently govern all things according to their own Passions or Interests And tho we cannot say who were the Favorites of every one of the  Assyrian  or  Egyptian  Kings yet the Examples beforemention'd of the different method follow'd in  Egypt  before and after the death of  Joseph  and in  Persis  whilst the idolatrous Princes and  Haman  or  Daniel Esther  and  Mordecai  were in credit the violent Changes happening thereupon give us reason to believe the like were in the times of other Kings and if we examin the Historys of latter Ages and the Lives of Princes that are more  exactly known we shall find that Kingdoms are more frequently sway'd by those who have Power with the Prince than by his own Judgment So that whosoever has to deal with Princes concerning Foreign or Domestick Affairs is oblig'd more to regard the humour of those Persons than the most important Interests of a Prince or People  I might draw too much envy upon my self if I should take upon me to cite all the Examples of this kind that are found in modern Historys or the Memoirs that do more precisely shew the Temper of Princes and the secret Springs by which they were mov'd But as those who have well observ'd the management of Affairs in  France  during the Reigns of  Francis  the First  Henry  the Second  Francis  the Second  Charles  the Ninth  Henry  the Third  Henry  the Fourth and  Lewis  the Thirteenth will confess that the Interests of the Dukes of  Montmorency  and  Guise  Queen  Katherine de Medicis  the Duke of  Epernon La  osseuse Madame de Guiche de Gabriele d' Entragues  the  Marechal d' Ancre  the Constable  de Luines  and the Cardinal  de Richelieu  were more to be consider'd by those who had any publick or private Business to treat at Court than the Opinions of those Princes or the most weighty Concernments of the State so it cannot be denied that other Kingdoms where Princes legally have or wrongfully usurp the like Power are govern'd in the like manner or if it be there is hardly any Prince's Reign that will not furnish abundant proof of what I have asserted  I agree with our Author that  good Order and Stability produce Strength  If Monarchy therefore excel in them Absolute Monarchys should be of more strength than those that are limited according to the proportion of their Riches extent of Territory and number of People that they govern and those limited Monarchys in the like proportion more strong than popular Governments or Commonwealths If this be so I wonder how a few of  those giddy Greeks who  according to our Author  had learning enough only to make them seditious  came to overthrow the vast Armys of the  Persians  as often as they met with 'em and seldom found any other difficulty than what arose from their own Countrymen who sometimes sided with the Barbarians Seditions are often rais'd by a little prating but when one Man was to fight against fifty or a hundred as at the Battels of  Salamis Platea Marathon  and others then Industry Wisdom Skill and Valour were requir'd and if their Learning had not made 'em to excel in those Vertues they must have bin overwhelm'd by the prodigious multitudes of their Enemys This was so well known to the  Persians  that when  Cyrus  the younger prepar'd to invade his Brother  Artaxerxes  Plut vit Artax  he brought together indeed a vast Army of  Asiaticks  but chiefly relied upon the Counsel and Valour of ten thousand  Grecians  whom he had engag'd to serve him These giddy heads accompanied with good hands in the great Battel near  Babylon  found no resistance from  Artaxerxes  his Army and when  Cyrus  was kill'd by accident in the pursuit of the Victory they had gain'd and their own Officers treacherously murder'd they made good their retreat into  Greece  under the conduct of  Xenophon  in despite of above four hundred thousand Horse and Foot who endeavour'd to oppose them They were destitute of Horse Mony Provisions Friends and all other help except what their Wisdom and Valour furnish'd them and thereupon relying they pass'd over the Bellys of all the Enemys that ventur'd to appear against them in a march of a thousand miles These things were perform'd in the weakness of popular confusion but  Agesilaus  not being sensible of so great defects accompanied only  with six and thirty  Spartans  and such other Forces as he could raise upon his personal credit adventur'd without Authority or Mony to undertake a War against that great King  Artaxerxes  and having often beaten  Pharnabazus  and  Tissaphernes  his Lieutenants was preparing to assault him in the heart of his Kingdom when he was commanded by the  Ephori  to return for the defence of his own Country  It may in like manner appear strange that  Alexander  with the Forces of  Greece  much diminish'd by the  Phocean Peloponnesian Theban  and other intestin Wars could overthrow all the Powers of the East and conquer more Provinces than any other Army ever saw if so much order and stability were to be found in absolute Monarchys and if the Liberty in which the  Grecians  were educated did only fit them for Seditions And it would seem no less astonishing that  Rome  and  Greece  whilst they were free should furnish such numbers of men excelling in all moral Vertues to the admiration of all succeeding Ages and thereby become so powerful that no Monarchs were able to resist them and that the same Countrys since the loss of their Liberty have always bin weak base cowardly and vicious if the same Liberty had not bin the Mother and Nurse of their Vertue as well as the root of their Power  It cannot be said that  Alexander  was a Monarch in our Author's sense for the power of the  Macedonian  Kings was small  Philip  confest the People were Freemen and his Son found them to be so when his Fortune had overthrown his Vertue and he fell to hate and fear that generosity of Spirit which it creates He made his Conquests by it and lov'd it as long as he deserv'd to be lov'd His Successors had the same fortune When their Hearts came to be fill'd with Barbarick Pride and to delight only in rendring men Slaves they became weak and base and were easily overthrown by the  Romans  whose Vertue and Fortune did also perish with their Liberty All the Nations they had to deal with had the same fate They never conquer'd a Free People without extreme difficulty They receiv'd many great defeats and were often necessitated to fight for their Lives against the  Latins Sabins Tuscans Samnites Carthaginians Spaniards  and in the height of their Power found it a hard work to subdue a few poor  Etolians  But the greatest Kings were easily overcome When  Antiochus  had insolently boasted that he would  Plut in vit Q Flamin  cover  Greece  and  Italy  with the multitude of his Troops  Quintius Flaminius  ingeniously compar'd his Army of  Persians Chaldeans Syrians Mesopotamians Cappadocians Arabians  and other base  Astatic  Slaves to a Supper set before him by a Grecian Freind which seeming to be of several sorts of Venison was all cut out of one Hog variously dress'd and not long after that vast multitude was as easily slaughter'd as the Hog had bin The greatest danger of the War with  Mithridates  was to avoid his Poisons and Treacherys and to follow him thro the Deserts where he fled When  Lucullus  with less than twenty thousand men had put  Tigranes  Plut in vit Lucul  with two hundred thousand to flight the  Roman  Soldiers who for a while had pursu'd the chace stood still on a sudden and fell into a loud laughter at themselves for using their Arms against such wretched cowardly Slaves If this be not enough to prove the Falshood of our Author's Proposition I desire it may be consider'd whether good Order or Stability be wanting in  Venice  Whether  Tuscany  be in a better condition to defend it self since it fell under the power of the  Medices  or when it was full of free Citys Whether it were an easy work to conquer  Switzerland  Whether the  Hollanders  are of greater strength since the recovery  of their Liberty or when they groan'd under the Yoke of  Spain  And lastly whether the intire conquest of  Scotland  and  Ireland  the Victorys obtain'd against the  Hollanders  when in the height of their Power and the reputation to which  England  did rise in less than five years after be good marks of the instability disorder and weakness of free Nations And if the contrary be true nothing can be more absurdly false than our Author's assertion  SECT XII The Glory Vertue and Power of the  Romans  began and ended with their Liberty  AMong many fine things propos'd by our Author I see none more to be admir'd or that better declares the soundness of his Judgment than that he is only pleas'd with the beginning and end of the  Roman  Empire and says  that their time of Liberty  between those two extremes  had nothing of good in it but that it was of short continuance  Whereas I dare affirm that all that was ever desirable or worthy of praise and imitation in  Rome  proceeded from its Liberty and grew up and perish'd with it which I think will not be contradicted by any but those who prefer the most sordid Vices before the most eminent Vertues who believe the People to have bin more worthily employ'd by the  Tarquins  in cleansing Jakes and common Shores than in acquiring the Dominion of the best part of Mankind and account it better for a People to be opprest with hard labour under a proud Master in a steril unhealthy tenmile Territory than to command all the Countrys that lie between the  Fuphrates  and  Britain  Such Opinions will hardly find any better Patrons than  Filmer  and his Disciples nor the matters of fact as they are represented be denied by any that know the Historys of those times Many  Romans  may have had seeds of vertue in them whilst in the insancy of that City they liv'd under Kings but they brought forth little fruit  Tarquin  sirnam'd the Proud being a  Grecian  by extraction had perhaps observ'd that the Vertue of that Nation had render'd them averse to the Divine Government he desir'd to set up and having by his wellnatur'd  Tullia  poison'd his own Brother her Husband and his own Wife her Sister married her kill'd her Father and spar'd none that he thought able to oppose his designs to finish the work he butcher'd the Senat with such as seem'd most eminent among the People and like a most pious Father endeavour'd to render the City desolate during that time they who would not be made instruments of those Villanys were oblig'd for their own safety to conceal their Vertues but he being remov'd they shin'd in their Glory Whilst he reign'd  Brutus Valerius Horatius Herminius Larcius  and  Coriolanus  lay hid and unregarded but when they came to fight for themselves and to imploy their Valour for the good of their Country they gave such testimonys of Bravery as have bin admir'd by all succeeding ages and settled such a Disciplin as produc'd others like to them or more excellent than they as long as their Liberty lasted In two hundred and sixty years that they remain'd under the Government of Kings tho all of 'em the last only excepted were chosen by the Senat and People and did as much to advance  the publick Service as could reasonably be expected from them their Dominion hardly extended so far as from  London  to  Hownslow  But in little more than three hundred years after they recover'd their Liberty they had subdu'd all the warlike Nations of  Italy  destroy'd vast Armys of the  Gauls Cimbri  and  Germans  overthrown the formidable power of  Carthage  conquer'd the Cisalpine and Transalpine  Gauls  with all the Nations of  Spain  notwithstanding the ferocity of the one and the more constant valour of the other with the prodigious multitudes of both They had brought all  Greece  into subjection and by the conquest of  Macedon  the Spoils of the World to adorn their City and found so little difficulty in all the Wars that happen'd between them and the greatest Kings after the Death of  Alexander  of  Epirus  and  Pirrhus  that the defeats of  Siphax Perses Antiochus Prusias Tigranes Ptolomy  and many others did hardly deserve to be number'd amongst their Victorys  It were ridiculous to impute this to chance or to think that Fortune which of all things is the most variable could for so many Ages continue the same course unless supported by Vertue or to suppose that all these Monarchys which are so much extol'd could have bin destroy'd by that Commonwealth if it had wanted Strength Stability Vertue or good Order The secret Counsels of God are impenetrable but the ways by which he accomplishes his designs are often evident When he intends to exalt a People he fills both them and their Leaders with the Vertues sutable to the accomplishment of his end and takes away all Wisdom and Vertue from those he resolves to destroy The Pride of the  Babylonians  and  Assyrians  fell thro the baseness of  Sardanapalus  and the great City was taken while  Belshazzar  lay drunk amongst his Whores The Empire was transported to the  Persians  and  Grecians  by the valour of  Cyrus Alexander  and the brave Armys that follow'd them Historys furnish us with innumerable examples of this kind But I think none can be found of a cowardly weak effeminate foolish illdisciplin'd People that have ever subdu'd such as were eminent in Strength Wisdom Valor and good Disciplin or that these qualitys have bin found or subsisted any where unless cultivated and nourish'd by a wellorder'd Government If this therefore was found among the  Romans  and not in the Kingdoms they overthrew they had the order and stability which the Monarchys had not and the Strength and Vertue by which they obtain'd such success was the product of them But if this Vertue and the glorious effects of it did begin with Liberty it also expir'd with the same The best men that had not fallen in Battel were glean'd up by the Proscriptions or circumvented for the most part by false and frivolous Accusations Mankind is inclin'd to Vice and the way to Vertue is so hard that it wants encouragement but when all Honours Advantages and Preferments are given to Vice and despis'd Vertue finds no other reward than Hatred Persecution and Death there are few who will follow it  Tacitus  well describes the State of the Empire when the  Tacit  Power was absolutely fallen into the hands of one  Italia novis cladibus vel post longam seculorum seriem repetitis afflicta Vrbs incendiis vastata consumptis antiquissimis delubris ipso Capitolio Civium manibus incenso pollutae ceremoniae magna adulteria plenum exiliis mare infecti caedibus scopuli atrocius in urbe saevitum Nobilitas opes omissi vel gesti honores pro crimine ob virtutes certissimum exitium  His following words shew that the rewards of these abominations were not less odious than the things themselves The highest Dignitys were bestow'd upon the  Delatores  who were a kind of Rogues like to our  Irish  Witnesses or those that by a new coin'd word we call  Trepanners  This is not a Picture drawn by a vulgar hand but by one of the best Painters in the world and being a Model that so much pleases our Author 'tis good to see what it produc'd The first fruit was such an intire degeneracy from all good that  Rome  may be justly said never to have produc'd a brave Man since the first age of her Slavery  Germanicus  and  Corbulo  were born  expirante Libertate  and the recompence they receiv'd did so little encourage others to follow their example that none have bin found in any degree like to them and those of the most noble Familys applied themselves to sleep laziness and luxury that they might not be suspected to be better than their Masters  Thraseas Soranus  and  Helvidius  were worthy men who resolv'd to persist in their Integrity tho they should die for it but that was the only thing that made them eminent for they were of unknown Familys not  Romans  by birth nor ever employ'd in War And those Emperors who did arrive to any degree of Vertue were  Spaniards Gauls Africans Thracians  and of all Nations except  Romans  The Patrician and Plebeian Familys which for many ages had fill'd the World with great Commanders and such as excel'd in all Vertues being thus extinguish'd or corrupted the common People fell into the lowest degree of baseness  Plebs sordida Circo Theatris sueta  That People which in  C Tacit  magnanimity surpast all that have bin known in the World who never found any Enterprize above their Spirit to undertake and Power to accomplish with their Liberty lost all their Vigor and Vertue They who by their Votes had dispos'd of Kingdoms and Provinces fell to desire nothing but to live and see  Duas tantum res anxius opta    P  nem Circenses  Juven Sat  Plays Whether their Emperors were good or bad they usually rejoic'd at their Death in hopes of getting a little Mony or Victuals from the Successor Tho the Empire was by this means grown weak and bloodless yet it could not fall on a sudden So vast a Body could not die in a moment All the neighbouring Nations had bin so much broken by their Power that none was able to take advantage of their Weakness and life was preserv'd by the strength of hungry Barbarians allur'd by the greatness of the Pay they receiv'd to defend those who had no power left to defend themselves This precarious and accidental help could not be durable They who for a while had bin contented with their Wages soon began to think it fit for them rather to fight for themselves than for their weak Masters and thereupon fell to set up Emperors depending on themselves or to seize upon the naked Provinces where they found no other difficulty than to contend with other Strangers who might have the like design upon the same Thus did the Armys of the East and West set up Emperors at their pleasure and tho the  Goths Vandals Huns Sueves Alans  and others had cruel Wars among themselves yet they fear'd and suffer'd little or nothing from the  Romans  This state of things was so soon observ'd that in the beginning of  Tiberius  his reign they who endeavour'd to excite the  Gauls  to take Arms us'd no other arguments than such as were drawn from the extreme weakness of the  Quam inop  Italia Plebs urbana imbellis nihil in exercitibus validum praeter externum▪  C Tacit An l  Romans  It was evident that after the Battels of  Philippi  and  Actium  the strength of the  Roman  Armys consisted of Strangers and even the Victorys that went under their name were gain'd by those Nations which in the time of their Liberty they had subdu'd They had nothing left but Riches gather'd out of their vast Dominions and they learn'd by their ruin that an Empire acquir'd by Vertue could not long be supported by Mony They who by their Valour had arriv'd at such a height of Glory Power Greatness and Happiness that was never equal'd and who in all appearance had nothing to fear from any foreign Power could never have fallen unless their Vertue and Disciplin had decay'd and the corruption of their Manners excited 'em to turn their victorious Swords into their own bowels Whilst they were in that flourishing condition they thought they had nothing more to desire than continuance but if our Author's judgment is to be follow'd there was  nothing of good in it except the shortness of its continuance  they were beholden to those who wrought the Change they were the better for the Battels of  Pharsalia Philippi Munda  and  Actium  the destruction of two thirds of the People with the slaughter of all the most eminent men among them was for their advantage The Proscriptions were wholsom Remedys  Tacitus  did not understand the state of his own Country when he seems to be  Ann  l l  asham'd to write the History of it  Nobis in arcto inglorius labor  when instead of such glorious things as had bin atchiev'd by the  Romans  whilst either the Senat or the Common Poople prevail'd he had nothing left to relate but  saeva jussa continuas accusationes fallaces amicitias perniciem innocentium  They enjoy'd nothing that was good from the expulsion of the  Tarquins  to the reestablishment of Divine absolute Monarchy in the Persons of those pious Fathers of the People  Tiberius Caligula Claudius Nero Galba Otho Vitellius  c There was no Vertue in the  Junii Horatii Cornelii Quintii Decii Manlii  but the generous and tenderhearted Princes beforemention'd were perfect examples of it Whilst annual Magistrats govern'd there was no stability  Sejanus Macro  and  Tigellinus  introduc'd good order Vertue was not esteem'd by the antient Senat and People  Messalina Agrippina Poppaea Narcissus Pallas Vinnius  and  Laco  knew how to put a just value upon it The irregularitys of popular Assemblys and want of Prudence in the Senat was repair'd by the temperate proceedings of the  German Pannonian  and Eastern Armys▪ or the modest discretion of the Pretorian Bands The City was deliver'd by them from the burden of governing the World and for its own good frequently plunder'd fir'd and at last with the rest of desolated  Italy  and the noblest Provinces of  Europe Asia  and  Africa  brought under the yoke of the most barbarous and cruel Nations By the same light we may see that those who endeavour'd to perpetuate the misery of Liberty to  Rome  or lost their lives in the defence of it were the worst or the most foolish of men and that they were the best who did overthrow it This rectifys all our Errors and if the highest Praises are due to him that did the work the next are well deserv'd by those who perish'd in attempting it and if the Sons of  Brutus  with their Companions the  Vitellii  and  Aquillii Claudius Appius  the  Decemvir  those that would have betray'd the City to  Porsenna Spurius Melius Spur Cassius Manlius Capitolinus Saturninus Catiline Cethegus Lentulus  had bin as fortunate as  Julius Caesar  they might as well have deserv'd an  Apotheosis  But if all this be false absurd bestial and abominable the principles that necessarily lead us to such conclusions are so also which is enough to shew that the Strength Vertue Glory Wealth  Power and Happiness of  Rome  proceeding from Liberty did rise grow and perish with it  SECT XIII There is disorder or prejudice in changing the name or number of Magistrats whilst the root and principle of their Power continues intire  IN the next place our Author would persuade us that the  Romans  were inconstant because of their changes from annual Consuls to Military Tribunes  Decemviri  and Dictators and gives the name of Sedition to the complaints made against Usury or the contests concerning Marriages or Magistracy But I affirm  That no change of Magistracy as to the name number or form dos testify irregularity or bring any manner of prejudice as long as it is done by those who have a right of doing it and he or they who are created continue within the power of the Law to accomplish the end of their institution many forms being in themselves equally good and may be us'd as well one as another according to times and other circumstances  In the second place 'tis a rare thing for a City at the first to be rightly constituted Men can hardly at once foresee all that may happen in many Ages and the changes that accompany them ought to be provided for  Rome  in its foundation was subject to these defects and the inconveniences arising from them were by degrees discover'd and remedi'd They did not think of regulating Usury till they saw the mischiefs proceeding from the cruelty of Usurers or of setting limits to the proportion of Land that one man might enjoy till the avarice of a few had so far succeeded that their Riches were grown formidable and many by the poverty to which they were reduc'd became useless to the City It was not time to make a Law that the Plebeians might marry with the Patricians till the distinction had rais'd the Patricians to such Pride as to look upon themselves to have something of divine and the others to be  Inauspicati  or profane and brought the City into danger by that division nor to make the Plebeians capable of being elected to the chief Magistracys till they had men able to perform the dutys of them But these things being observ'd remedys were seasonably apply'd without any bloodshed or mischief tho not without noise and wrangling  All human Constitutions are subject to corruption and must perish unless timely renew'd and reduc'd to their first principles This was chiefly done by means of those Tumults which our Author ignorantly blames The whole People by whom the Magistracy had bin at first created executed their power in those things which comprehend Sovereignty in the highest degree and brought every one to acknowledg it There was nothing that they could not do who first confer'd the supreme Honours upon the Patricians and then made the Plebeians equal to them Yet their Modesty was not less than their Power or Courage and therefore when by the Law they might have made a Plebeian Consul they did not chuse one in forty years and when they did make use of their Right in advancing men of their own Order they were so prudent that they cannot  be said to have bin mistaken in their Elections three times whilst their Votes were free whereas of all the Emperors that came in by Usurpation pretence of Blood from those who had usurp'd or that were set up by the Soldiers or a few Electors hardly three can be nam'd who deserv'd that Honour and most of them were such as seem'd to be born for Plagues to Mankind  He manifests his fraud or ignorance in attributing the Legislative power sometimes to the Senat and sometimes to the People for the Senat never had it The stile of  Senatus censuit Populus jussit  was never alter'd but the right of Advising continuing in the Senat that of Enacting ever continu'd in the People  An occasion of commending absolute Power in order to the establishment of Hereditary Monarchy is absurdly drawn from their Custom of creating a Dictator in time of danger for no man was ever created but such as seem'd able to bear so great a burden which in hereditary Governments is wholly left to chance Tho his Power was great it did arise from the Law and being confin'd to six months 'twas almost impossible for any man to abuse it or to corrupt so many of those who had enjoy'd the same honour or might aspire to it as to bring them for his pleasure to betray their Country and as no man was ever chosen who had not given great testimonys of his Vertues so no one did ever forseit the good opinion conceiv'd of him Vertue was then honour'd and thought so necessarily to comprehend a sincere love and fidelity to the Commonwealth that without it the most eminent qualitys were reputed vile and odious and the memory of former Services could no way expiate the guilt of conspiring against it This seeming Severity was in truth the greatest Clemency for tho our Author has the impudence to say that during the  Roman Liberty the best men thriv'd worst and the worst best  he cannot alledg one example of any eminent  Roman  put to death except  Manlius Capitolinus  from the expulsion of the  Tarquins  to the time of the  Gracchi  and the Civil Wars not long after ensuing and of very few who were banish'd By these means Crimes were prevented and the temptations to evil being remov'd Treachery was destroy'd in the root and such as might be naturally ambitious were made to see there was no other way to Honour and Power than by acting vertuously  But lest this should not be sufficient to restrain aspiring men what Power soever was granted to any Magistrate the Sovereignty still remain'd in the People and all without exception were subject to them This may seem strange to those who think the Dictators were absolute because they are said to have bin  sine provocatione  but that is to be only understood in relation to other Magistrats and not to the People as is clearly prov'd in the case of  Q Fabius  whom  Papirius  the Dictator    av    would have put to death  Tribunos Plebis appello  says  Fabius Maximus  his Father  provoco ad Populum eum{que} tibi fugienti exercitus tui fugienti Senatus Judicium judicem sero qui certe unus plusquam tua dicta  ura potest polletque videro cessurusne sis provocationi cui Tullus Hostilius cessit  And tho the People did rather intercede for  Fabius  than command his deliverance that modesty did evidently proceed from an opinion that  Papirius  was in the right and tho they desir'd to save  Fabius  who seems to have bin one of the greatest and best men that ever the City produc'd they would not enervate that military Disciplin to which they ow'd not only their greatness but their subsistence most especially  when their Sovereign Authority was acknowledg'd by all and the Dictator himself had submitted This right of Appeals to the People was the foundation of the  Roman  Commonwealth laid in the days of  Romulus  T Liv l  submitted to by  Hostilius  in the case of  Horatius  and never violated till the Laws and the Liberty which they supported were overthrown by the power of the Sword This is confirm'd by the speech of  Metellus  the Tribune who in the time of the second  Carthaginian  War causelesly disliking the Proceedings of  Q Fabius Maximus  then Dictator in a publick Assembly of the People said  Quod si antiquus animus Plebi  T Liv l  Romanae esset se audacter laturum de abrogando Q Fabii Imperio nunc modicam rogationem promulgaturum de aequando Magistri Equitum Dictatoris jure  which was done and that Action which had no precedent shews that the People needed none and that their Power being eminently above that of all Magistrats was oblig'd to no other rule than that of their own Will Tho I do therefore grant that a Power like to the Dictatorian limited in time circumscrib'd by Law and kept perpetually under the supreme Authority of the People may by vertuous and welldisciplin'd Nations upon some occasions be prudently granted to a vertuous man it can have no relation to our Author's Monarch whose Power is in himself subject to no Law perpetually exercis'd by himself and for his own sake whether he has any of the abilitys requir'd for the due performance of so great a work or be intirely destitute of them nothing being more unreasonable than to deduce consequences from cases which in substance and circumstances are altogether unlike but to the contrary these examples shewing that the  Romans  even in the time of such Magistrats as seem'd to be most absolute did retain and exercise the Sovereign Power do most evidently prove that the Government was ever the same remaining in the People who without prejudice might give the Administration to one or more men as best pleas'd themselves and the success shews that they did it prudently  SECT XIV No Sedition was hurtful to  Rome  till thro their Prosperity some men gain'd a Power above the Laws  LIttle pains is requir'd to confute our Author who imputes much bloodshed to the popular Government of  Rome  for he cannot prove that one man was unjustly put to death or slain in any Sedition before  Publius Gracchus  The Foundations of the Commonwealth were then so shaken that the Laws could not be executed and whatsoever did then fall out ought to be attributed to the Monarchy for which the great Men began to contend Whilst they had no other Wars than with neighboring Nations they had a strict eye upon their Commanders and could preserve Disciplin among the Soldiers but when by the excellence of their Valour and Conduct the greatest Powers of the World were subdu'd and for the better carrying on of foreign Wars Armys were suffer'd to continue in the same hands longer than the Law did direct Soldiery came to be accounted a Trade and those who had the worst designs against the Commonwealth began to savour all manner of Licentiousness and Rapine that they might gain the savour of the Legions who by that means became  unruly and seditious 'twas hard if not impossible to preserve a Civil equality when the Spoils of the greatest Kingdoms were brought to adorn the Houses of private men and they who had the greatest Citys and Nations to be their Dependents and Clients were apt to scorn the power of the Law This was a most dangerous Disease like those to which human Bodys are subject when arriv'd to that which Physicians call the Athletick habit proceeding from the highest perfection of Health Activity and Strength that the best Constitution by Diet and Exercise can attain Whosoever falls into them shews that he had attain'd that perfection and he who blames that which brings a State into the like condition condemns that which is most perfect among men Whilst the  Romans  were in the way to this no Sedition did them any hurt they were compos'd without Blood and those that seem'd to be the most dangerous produc'd the best Laws But when they were arriv'd to that condition no Order could do them good the fatal period set to human things was come they could go no higher  Lucan l  Summisque negatum  Stare diu  and all that our Author blames is not to be imputed to their Constitution but their departing from it All men were ever subject to error and it may be said that the mistaken People in the space of about three hundred years did unjustly fine or banish five or six men but those mistakes were so frankly acknowledg'd and carefully repair'd by Honours bestow'd upon the injur'd Persons as appears by the Examples of  Camillus Livius Salinator Paulus Emylius  and others that they deserve more praise than if they had not fail'd  If for the abovemention'd time Seditions were harmless or profitable they were also absolutely exempted from Civil Wars Those of  Apulia  and  Greece  were Revolts of conquer'd Nations and can no way fall under that name But 'tis most absurdly apply'd to the servile and gladiatorian Wars for the Gladiators were Slaves also and Civil Wars can be made only by those who are Members of the Civil Society which Slaves are not Those that made the  bellum Sociale  were Freemen but not Citizens and the War they made could not be call'd Civil The  Romans  had three ways of dealing with conquer'd Nations  Some were receiv'd into the body of the City  Civitate donati  as the  Latins  by  Romulus  the  Albans  by  Hostilius  the  Privernates  when their Ambassador declar'd that no Peace could be durable unless it were just and easy and the Senat said  Se viri liberi vocem audivisse tales{que} dignos esse ut Romani siant  and the like Favour was shown to many others  By making Leagues with them as  Livy  says  Populum Romanum devictos bello populos malle societate amicitia habere conjunctos quam tristi subjectos servitio  Of which sort were the  Samnites  who not liking their condition join'd with  Hannibal  and afterwards under the conduct of the brave  Telesinus  with other Nations that liv'd under the condition of  Socii  made an unprosperous attempt to deliver themselves  Those who after many Rebellions were  in Provinciam redacti  as the  Capuans  when their City was taken by  Appius Claudius  and  Q F  lvius Flaccus  We osten hear of Wars made by those of the two latter sorts but of none that can be call'd Civil till the times of  Marius Sylla  and  Catiline  and as they are to be esteem'd the last Struglings of expiring Liberty  when the Laws by which it had subsisted were enervated so those that happen'd between  Cesar  and  Pompey Octavius  and  Antonius  with the Proscriptions Triumvirate and all the Mischiefs that accompany'd them are to be imputed wholly to the Monarchy for which they contended as well as those between  Nero Galba Otho Vitellius  and  Vespasian  that hardly ever ceas'd till the Empire was abolish'd for the name of a Commonwealth continu'd to the end and I know not why  Tiberius  or  Nero  might not use it as well as  Sylla  or  Marius  Yet if our Author be resolv'd to impute to Popular Government all that pass'd before  Cesar  made himself perpetual Dictator he will find no more than is seen in all places We have known few small States and no great one free from Revolts of Subjects or Allies and the greatest Empire of the East was overthrown by the rebellion of the  Mammalukes  their Slaves If there is any difference to be observ'd between what happen'd at  Rome  'tis chiefly that whilst there was any shadow of Liberty the Slaves Gladiators Subjects or Allies were always beaten and suppress'd whereas in the time of the Emperors the Revolt of a Province was sufficient to give a new Master to the best part of Mankind and he having no more power than was requir'd for a present Mischief was for the most part in a short time destroy'd by another But to please our Author I will acknowledg a second defect even that Wantonness to which he ascribes all their Disorders tho I must withal desire him to consider from whence Wantonness dos proceed If the People of  Turky  or  France  did rebel I should think they were driven to it by Misery Beggery or Despair and could lay Wantonness only to the charge of those who enjoy much Prosperity Nations that are opprest and made miserable may fall into Rage but can never grow wanton In the time of the  Roman  Emperors the Pretorian Cohorts or the Armys that had the liberty of ravaging the richest Provinces might be proud of their Strength or grow wanton thro the abundance of their Enjoyments The Janizarys in later Ages may for the same reasons have fallen into the like excesses but such as have lost their Liberty are in no danger of them When all the Nobility of  Rome  was destroy'd and those who excel'd in Reputation or Vertue were fallen in the Wars or by the Proscriptions when two thirds of the People were slain the best Citys and Colonys burnt the Provinces exhausted and the small remains left in them opprest with a most miserable slavery they may have revolted and sometimes did as the  Britans Batavians  and others mention'd in the  Roman  History But they were driven to those Revolts by Fury and Necessity arising from the Miserys and Indignitys they suffer'd under an insupportable Tyranny and Wantonness had no part in them The People of  Rome  when they were a little freed from the Terror of the Soldiers did sometimes for the same reasons conspire against the Emperors and when they could do no more exprest their hatred by breaking their Statues But after the Battels of  Pharsalia Philippi  and the Proscriptions they never committed any folly thro Wantonness In the like manner  Naples  and  Sicily  have revolted within these few years and some who are well acquainted with the State of those Kingdoms think them ready again to do the like but if it should so happen no man of understanding would impute it to Wantonness The Pressures under which they groan have cur'd 'em of all such Diseases and the  Romans  after the loss of their Liberty could never fall into them They may have grown wanton when their Authority was reverenc'd their Vertue admir'd  their Power irresistible and the Riches of the World were flowing in upon them as it were to corrupt their Manners by inticing them to pleasure But when all that was lost and they found their Persons expos'd to all manner of Violence from the basest of men their Riches exhausted by Tributes and Rapine whilst the Treasures of the Empire were not sufficient to supply the Luxury of their Masters the misery they suffer'd and the shame of suffering it with the contemptible weakness to which they were reduc'd did too strongly admonish them that the Vices of Wantonness belong'd only to those who enjoy'd a Condition far different from theirs and the memory of what they had lost sharpned the sense of what they felt This is the state of things which pleases our Author and by praising that Government which depriv'd those who were under it of all that is most desirable in the world and introduc'd all that ought to be detested he sufficiently shews that he delights only in that which is most abominable and would introduce his admir'd Absolute Monarchy only as an Instrument of bringing Vice Misery Devastation and Infamy upon Mankind  SECT XV The Empire of  Rome  perpetually decay'd when it fell into the hands of one Man  IN pursuance of his Design our Author with as much Judgment as Truth denies that  Rome  became Mistress of the World under the Popular Government  It is not so  says he  for  Rome  began her Empire under Kings and did perfect it under Emperors It did only increase under that Popularity Her greatest exaltation was under  Trajan  and longest Peace under  Augustus For the illustration of which I desire these few things may be consider'd  That the first Monarchy of  Rome  was not absolute The Kings were made by the People without regard to any Man's Title or other reason than the common Good chusing him that seem'd most likely to procure it setting up at the same time a Senat consisting of a hundred of the most eminent Men among them and after the reception of the  Sabins  into the City adding as many more to them and committing the principal part of the Government to their care retaining the power of making those Laws to which the Kings who reign'd by their Command were subject and reserving to themselves the Judgment of all great Matters upon Appeal If any of their Kings deserv'd to be call'd a Monarch according to  Filmer  's Definition it was the last  Tarquin  for he alone of all their  L  v l  Kings reign'd not  jussu Populi  but came in by Treachery and Murder If he had continu'd he had cur'd the People of all Vices proceeding from Wantonness but his farthest Conquest was of the small Town of  Gabii  ten miles distant from  Rome  which he effected by the fraud of his detestable Son and that being then the utmost limit of the  Roman  Empire must deserve to be call'd the World or the Empire of it was not gain'd by their Kings  The Extent of Conquests is not the only nor the chief thing that ought to be consider'd in them regard is to be had to the Means whereby they are made and the Valour or Force that was employ'd by the Enemy  In these respects not only the overthrow of  Carthage  and the Conquests of  Spain  but the Victorys gain'd against the  Sabins Latins Tuscans Samnites  and other valiant Nations of  Italy  who most obstinately defended their Liberty when the  Romans  had no Forces but their own shew more Vertue and deserve incomparably more Praise than the Defeats of any Nations whatsoever when they were increas'd in Number Riches Reputation and Power and had many other warlike People iustructed in their Disciplin and fighting under their Ensigns But I deny that the  Romans  did ever make any considerable acquisition after the loss of their Liberty They had already subdu'd all  Italy Greece Macedon  the Islands of the  Mediterranean  Sea  Thracia Illyrium Asia  the Less  Pontus Armenia Syria Egypt Africa Gaul  and  Spain  The Forces of  Germany  were broken a Bridg laid over the  Rhine  and all the Countrys on this side subdu'd This was all that was ever gain'd by the Valour of their own Forces and that could bring either Honour or Profit But I know of no Conquest made after that time unless the name of Conquest be given to  Caligula  's Expedition when he said he had subdu'd the Sea in making an useless Bridg from  Puteoli  to  Baiae  or that of the other Fool who enter'd  Rome  in triumph for having gather'd shells on the Seashore  Trajan  's Expedition into the East was rather a Journy than a War He rambled over the Provinces that  Augustus  had abandon'd as not worth keeping and others that had nothing to defend them but illarm'd and unwarlike Barbarians Upon the whole matter he seems to have bin led only by Curiosity and the vanity of looking upon them as Conquests appears in their being relinquish'd as soon as gain'd  Britain  was easily taken from a naked and unskilful tho a brave People hardly kept and shamefully lost But tho the Emperors had made greater Wars than the Commonwealth vanquish'd Nations of more valour and skill than their  Italian  Neighbours the  Grecians  or  Carthaginians  subdu'd and slaughter'd those that in Numbers and Ferocity had exceeded the  Cimbri Gauls  and  Teutons  encounter'd Captains more formidable than  Pirrhus  and  Hannibal  it might indeed increase the Glory of him that should have done it but could add nothing of Honour or Advantage to the  Roman  Name The Nobility was extirpated long before the People corrupted and enslav'd  Italy  lay desolate so as a  Roman  was hardly to be found in a  Roman  Army which was generally compos'd of such as fighting for themselves or their Commander never thought of any thing less than the Interest of  Rome  And as it is impossible that what is so neglected and betray'd should be durable that Empire which was acquir'd by the Valour and Conduct of the bravest and best disciplin'd People of the World decay'd and perish'd in the hands of those Absolute Monarchs who ought to have preserv'd it  Peace is desirable by a State that is constituted for it who contenting themselves with their own Territorys have no desires of enlarging them Or perhaps it might simply deserve praise if Mankind were so fram'd that a People intending hurt to none could preserve themselves but the World being so far of another temper that no Nation can be safe without Valour and Strength those Governments only deserve to be commended which by Disciplin and Exercise increase both and the  Roman  above all that excel'd in both Peace therefore may be good in its season and was so in  Numa  's Reign yet two or three such Kings would have encourag'd some active Neighbours to put an end to that aspiring City before its Territory had extended beyond  Fidenae  But the Disciplin that  best agreed with the Temper and Designs of a Warlike People being renew'd by his brave Successors the Dangers were put on their Enemys and all of them the last only excepted persisting in the same way did reasonably well perform their Duty When they were remov'd and the Affairs of the City depended no longer upon the Temper or Capacity of one Man the ends for which the City was constituted were vigorously pursu'd and such Magistrats annually chosen as would not long continue in a universal Peace till they had gotten the Empire to which they aspir'd or were by ill Fortune brought to such weakness as to be no longer able to make War Both of these happen'd in the so much magnify'd Reign of  Augustus  He found the Empire so great that all Additions might rationally be rejected as useless or prejudicial and  Italy  so exhausted that Wars could only be carry'd on by the strength of Strangers It was time to lie still when they had no power to act and they might do it safely whilst the Reputation gain'd by former Victorys preserv'd them from Foreign Invasions When  Crassus Pompey  and  Cesar  who had torn the Commonwealth into three Monarchys were kill'd and the Flower of the  Roman  Nobility and People destroy'd with them or by them When  Cato  's Vertue had prov'd too weak to support a falling State and  Brutus  with  Cassius  had perish'd in their noble Attempt to restore their Liberty When the best part of the Senat had bin expos'd for a Prey to the Vulturs and Wolves of  Thessaly  and one hundred and thirty of those who deserv'd the hatred of Tyrants and had escap'd the fury of War had bin destroy'd by the Proscriptions When neither Captains nor Soldiers remain'd in the desolate City when the Tyrant abhor'd and fear'd all those who had either Reputation or Vertue and by the most subtil Arts endeavour'd so to corrupt or break the Spirits of the remaining People that they might not think of their former Greatness or the ways of recovering it we ought not to wonder that they ceas'd from War But such a Peace is no more to be commended than that which Men have in the Grave as in the Epitaph of the Marquess  Trivultio  seen at  Milan Qui nunquam quievit quiescit tace  This Peace is in every Wilderness The Turks have establish'd it in the empty Provinces of  Asia  and  Greece  Where there are no men or if those men have no Courage there can be no War Our Ancestors the  Britans  observ'd that the Peace which in that Age the  Romans  establish'd in the Provinces consisted in the most  C Tacit  wretched slavery and solitude  Miserrimam servitutem pacem appellant  And in another place  Solitudinem faciunt pacem vocant  This is the Peace the  Spaniards  settled in their Dominions of the  WestIndies  by the destruction of above  Barth de las Casas destruy  de las Indias  forty millions of Souls The Countrys were very quiet when wild Beasts only were left to fight in them or a few miserable Wretches who had neither strength nor courage to resist their violence This was the Peace the  Romans  enjoy'd under  Augustus  A few of those who made themselves subservient to his Pleasure and Ministers of the publick Calamitys were put into a flourishing condition but the rest pin'd wither'd and never recover'd If yet our Author will have us to think the Liberty and People of  Rome  oblig'd to  Augustus  who procur'd such a Peace for them he ought to remember that besides what they suffer'd in settling it they paid dear for it even in the future for  Italy  was thereby so weaken'd as never to recover any strength or vertue to desend it self but depending absolutely upon barbarous Nations or Armys compos'd of them was ravag'd and torn in pieces by every Invader  That Peace is only to be valu'd which is accompany'd with Justice and those Governments only deserve praise who put the Power into the hands of the best Men This was wholly wanting during the Reigns of  Augustus  and his Successors The worst of men gain'd the Sovereignty by Alliance Fraud or Violence and advanc'd such as most resembled themselves  Augustus  was worse in the beginning than in the latter end of his Reign but his bloody and impure Successor grew every day more wicked as long as he liv'd Whilst he sat upon the Rocks at  Capreae  with his  Chaldeans  he meditated nothing but Lust or Mischief and had  Sejanus  and  Macro  always ready to execute his detestable Designs  Caligula  could find none equal to himself in all manner of Villanys but savour'd those most who were likest to him  Claudius  his stupidity drunkenness and subjection to the fury of two impudent Strumpets and manumis'd Slaves prov'd as hurtful to the Empire as the savage fury of his Predecessor Tho  Nero  was a Monster that the World could not bear yet the raging Soldiers kill'd  Galba  and gave the Empire to  Otho  for no other reason than that he had bin the Companion of his Debauches and of all men was thought most to resemble him With them all Evils came in like a Flood and their Successors finding none so bad as themselves but the Favorites Whores and Slaves that govern'd them would suffer no Vertue to grow up and fill'd the City with a base leud and miserable Rabble that car'd for nothing beyond Stageplays and Bread Such a People could not be seditious but  Rome  had bin desolate if they had not thus fill'd it And tho this temper and condition of a People may please our Author yet it was an incurable Wound to the State and in consequence to the best part of the World  When the City had bin burnt by the  Gauls  it was soon restor'd The Defeats of  Ticinum Trebia Thrasimene  and  Cannae  were repair'd with equal or greater Victorys The War of the Allies ended in their overthrow The Fury of the Gladiators was extinguish'd with their Blood The Commonwealth lost Battels but was never conquer'd in any War and in the end triumph'd over all that had contended with them Whilst Liberty continu'd it was the Nurse of Vertue and all the Losses suffer'd in Foreign or Civil Wars were easily recover'd but when Liberty was lost Valour and Vertue was torn up by the roots and the  Roman  Power proceeding from it perish'd  I have not dwelt so long upon this point to expose the folly of our Author but to show that the abovemention'd Evils did proceed from a permanent cause which will always produce the like effects and Historys testify that it has done the same in all places  Carthage  was rebuilt after i  had bin destroy'd by  Scipio  and continu'd to be a rich City for almost a thousand years but produc'd no such Men as  Amilcar Asdrubal  and  Hannibal Cleomenes  and  Euclidas  were the last that deserv'd to be call'd  Spartans Athens  never had an eminent Man after it felt the weight of the  Macedonian  Yoke and  Philopemen  was the last of the  Achaians  Tho the Commonwealths of  Italy  in later Ages having too much apply'd themselves to the acquisition of Mony wanted that greatness of Spirit which had reign'd in their Ancestors yet they have not bin without Valour and Vertue That of  Pisa  was famous for Power at Sea till the  Genoeses  overthrew them  Florence  had a brave Nobility and a stout People  Arezzo Pistoia Cortona Sienna  and other small Towns of  Tuscany  were not without strength tho for the most part unhappily exercis'd in the Factions of  Ghibelins  and  Guelphs Neri  and  Bianchi  that  divided all  Italy  but since the introduction of  Filmer  's divine Absolute Monarchy all Power Vertue Reputation and Strength are utterly perish'd from among them and no man dares to oppose the publick Mischiefs They usually decide private Quarrels by Assassination or Poison and in other respects they enjoy the happiness of that Peace which is always found within empty Walls and desolated Countrys And if this be according to the Laws of God and Nature it cannot be deny'd that Weakness Baseness Cowardice Destruction and Desolation are so likewise These are the Blessings our wellnatur'd Author would confer upon us but if they were to be esteem'd so I cannot tell why those that felt them complain'd so much of 'em  Tacitus  reciting what past in his time and somewhat before for want of a Christian Spirit in the bitterness of  Tacit l  his Soul says  Nec unquam atrocioribus Populi Romani cladibus magisque justis indiciis probatum est non esse curae Deis securitatem nostram esse ultionem  Some thought that no Punishments could be justly deserv'd by a People that had so much favour'd Vertue others that even the Gods they ador'd envied their Felicity and Glory but all confess'd they were fallen from the highest pitch of human Happiness into the lowest degree of Infamy and Misery And our Author being the first that ever found they had gain'd by the change we are to attribute the discovery of so great a Spirit to the excellency of his Wisdom If suspending my Judgment in this point till it be prov'd by better Authority than his word I in the mean time follow the opinion of those who think Slavery dos naturally produce meanness of Spirit with its worst effect flattery which  Tacitus  calls  foedum servitutis crimen  I must believe that the Impudence of carrying it to such a height as to commend nothing in the most glorious Liberty that made the most vertuous People in the world but the shortness of its continuance and to prefer the Tyranny of the basest of Men or worst of Monsters is peculiar to  Filmer  and that their wickedness which had never bin equal'd is surpast by him who recommends as the Ordinance of God the Principles that certainly produce them  But  says our Author  tho  Rome  was for a while miraculously upheld in Glory by a greater Prudence than its own yet in a short time after manifold Alterations she was ruin'd by her own hand  But 'tis absurd to say that the overthrow of a Government which had nothing of good in it can be a ruin or that the Glory in which it continu'd had nothing of good in it and most of all that it could be ruin'd by no hands but its own if that Glory had not bin gain'd and immediately or instrumentally supported by such vertue and strength as is worthily to be prefer'd before all other temporal Happiness and dos ever produce it This shews that Liars ought to have good memorys But passing over such foolish Contradictions I desire to know how that  Prudence greater than its own  which till I am better inform'd I must think to be inseparably united to Justice and Goodness came miraculously to support a Government which was not only evil in it self as contrary to the Laws of God and Nature but so perpetually bent against that Monarchy which he says is according to them as to hate all Monarchs despise all that would live under them destroy as many of them as came within their reach and make a Law by which any man was authoris'd to kill him who should endeavour to set up this Divine Power among them Moreover no human Prudence preserv'd the Roman Glory but their own the others directly set themselves to oppose it and the most eminent fell under it We know of no Prudence  surpassing the human unless it be the Divine But the Divine Prudence did never miraculously exert it self except to bear witness to the Truth and to give authority to those that announc'd it If therefore the Glory of this Popular Government was miraculously supported by a more than human Prudence it was good in it self the Miracles done in favour of it did testify it and all that our Author says against it is false and abominable  If I lay aside the word  Miraculous  as put in by chance 'twill be hard to know how God who in the usual course of his Providence guides all things by such a gentle and undiscern'd Power that they seem to go on of themselves should give such vertue to this popular Government and the Magistrats bred up under it that the greatest Monarchs of the Earth were as dust before them unless there had bin an excellency in their Disciplin far surpassing that of their Enemys or how that can be call'd ill in its Principle and said to comprehend no good which God did so gloriously support and no man was ever able to resist This cannot be better answer'd than by our Author's Citation  Suis ipsa Roma viribus ruit  That City which had overthrown the greatest Powers of the World must in all appearance have lasted for ever if their Vertue and Disciplin had not decay'd or their Forces bin turn'd against themselves If our Author therefore say true the greatest good that ever befel the  Romans  was the decay of their Vertue and Disciplin and the turning of their own Arms against themselves was not their Ruin but their Preservation  When they had brought the warlike Nations of  Italy  into subjection or association often represt the fury of the  Gauls Cimbri  and  Teutons  overthrown the Wealth Power and Wit of  Carthage  supported by the Skill Industry and Valour of  Hannibal  and his brave Relations almost extirpated the valiant  Spaniards  who would no other way be subdu'd defeated  Philip Perses Antiochus Gentius Syphax  and  Jugurtha  struck an aw into  Ptolomy  avoided the snares and poisons of  Mithridates  follow'd him in his Flights reveng'd his Treacherys and carry'd their victorious Arms beyond his conquer'd Kingdoms to the Banks of  Tygris  When neither the Revolt of their  Italian  Associats nor the Rebellion of their Slaves led by  Spartacus  who in skill seems to have bin equal to  Hannibal  and above him in Courage could put a stop to their Victorys When  Greece  had bin reduc'd to yield to a Vertue rather than a Power greater than their own we may well say that Government was supported by a more than human prudence which led them thro Vertue to a height of Glory Power and Happiness that till that day had bin unknown to the World and could never have bin ruin'd if by the decay of that Vertue they had not turn'd their victorious Arms against themselves That City was a Giant that could die by no other hand than his own like  Hercules  poison'd and driven into madness after he had destroy'd Thieves Monsters and Tyrants and found nothing on the Earth able to resist him The wisest of men in antient times looking upon this as a point of more than human Perfection thought or feign'd to think that he was descended from the Gods and at his death receiv'd into their number tho perhaps  Filmer  would prefer a weak base and effeminate Slave before him The matter will not be much different if we adhere to the foremention'd similitude of the  Athletick Habit  for the danger proceeds only from the perfection of it and he who dislikes it must commend that Weakness and Vice which may perish but can never  be chang'd into any thing worse than it self as those that lie upon the ground can never fall However this Fall of the  Romans  which our Author speaking truth against his will calls their Ruin was into that which he recommends as the Ordinance of God Which is as much as to say that they were ruin'd when they fell from their own unnatural Inventions to follow the Law of God and of Nature that Luxury also thro which they fell was the product of their Felicity and that the Nations that had bin subdu'd by them had no other way of avenging their Defeats than by alluring their Masters to their own Vices This was the Root of their Civil Wars When that proud City found no more resistance it grew  Saevior armis  Luxuria incubuit victum{que} ulciscitur orbem  Lucan  wanton Honest Poverty became uneasy when Honours were given to illgotten Riches This was so Monarchical that a People infected with such a Custom must needs fall by it They who by Vice had exhausted their Fortunes could repair them only by bringing their Country under a Government that would give impunity to Rapine and such as had not Vertues to deserve Advancement from the Senat and People would always endeavour to set up a Man that would bestow the Honours due to Vertue upon those who would be most abjectly subservient to his Will and Interests When mens minds are fill'd with this Fury they sacrifice the common Good to the advancement of their private Concernments This was the temper of  Catiline  exprest by  Sallust  Sallust Bell Catilin  Luxuria principi gravis paupertas vix à privato toleranda  and this put him upon that desperate extremity to say  Incendium meum ruinâ extinguam  Others in the same manner being fill'd with the same rage he could not want Companions in his most villanous Designs 'Tis not long since a Person of the highest Quality and no less famous for Learning and Wit having observ'd the State of  England  as it stood not many years ago and that to which it has bin reduc'd since the year sixty as is thought very much by the Advice and Example of  France  said That they were now taking a most cruel Vengeance upon us for all the Overthrows receiv'd from our Ancestors by introducing their most damnable Maxims and teaching us the worst of their Vices 'Tis not for me to determin whether this Judgment was rightly made or not for I intend not to speak of our Affairs but all Historians agreeing that the change of the  Roman  Government was wrought by such means as I have mention'd and our Author acknowledging that change to have bin their ruin as in truth it was I may justly conclude that the overthrow of that Government could not have bin a ruin to them but good for them unless it had bin good and that the Power which did ruin it and was set up in the room of it cannot have bin according to the Laws of God or Nature for they confer only that which is good and destroy nothing that is so but must have bin most contrary to that good which was overthrown by it  SECT XVI The best Governments of the World have bin compos'd of Monarchy Aristocracy and Democracy  OUR Author's cavils concerning I know not what vulgar Opinions that Democracys were introduc'd to curb Tyranny deserve no answer for our question is Whether one form of Government be prescrib'd to us by God and Nature or we are left according to our own understanding to constitute such as seem best to our selves As for Democracy he may say what pleases him of it and I believe it can sute only with the convenience of a small Town accompany'd with such Circumstances as are seldom sound But this no way obliges men to run into the other extreme in as much as the variety of Forms between mere Democracy and Absolute Monarchy is almost infinite And if I should undertake to say there never was a good Government in the world that did not consist of the three simple Species of Monarchy Aristocracy and Democracy I think I might make it good This at the least is certain that the Government of the  Hebrews  instituted by God had a Judg the great  Sanhedrin  and General Assemblys of the People  Sparta  had two Kings a Senat of twenty eight chosen Men and the like Assemblys All the  Dorian  Citys had a chief Magistrat a Senat and occasional Assemblys The  Ionian Athens  and others had an  Archon  the  Areopagi  and all Judgments concerning matters of the greatest importance as well as the Election of Magistrats were refer'd to the People  Rome  in the beginning had a King and a Senat whilst the Election of Kings and Judgments upon Appeals remain'd in the People afterwards Consuls representing Kings and vested with equal Power a more numerous Senat and more frequent meetings of the People  Venice  has at this day a Duke the Senat of the  Pregadi  and the Great Assembly of the Nobility which is the whole City the rest of the Inhabitants being only  Incolae  not  Cives  and those of the other Citys or Countrys are their Subjects and do not participate of the Government  Genoa  is govern'd in like manner  Luca  not unlike to them  Germany  is at this day govern'd by an Emperor the Princes or great Lords in their several Precincts the Citys by their own Magistrats and by general Diets in which the whole Power of the Nation resides and where the Emperor Princes Nobility and Citys have their places in person or by their Deputys All the Northern Nations which upon the dissolution of the  Roman  Empire possest the best Provinces that had compos'd it were under that form which is usually call'd the  Gothick  Polity They had King Lords Commons Diets Assemblys of Estates Cortez and Parliaments in which the Sovereign Powers of those Nations did reside and by which they were exercis'd The like was practis'd in  Hungary Bohemia Sweden Denmark Poland  and if things are chang'd in some of these places within a few years they must give better proofs of having gain'd by the change than are yet seen in the World before I think my self oblig'd to change my opinion  Some Nations not liking the name of King have given such a power as Kings enjoy'd in other places to one or more Magistrats either limited  to a certain time or left to be perpetual as best pleas'd themselves Others approving the Name made the Dignity purely elective Some have in their Elections principally regarded one Family as long as it lasted Others consider'd nothing but the fitness of the Person and reserv'd to themselves a Liberty of taking where they pleas'd Some have permitted the Crown to be hereditary as to its ordinary course but restrain'd the Power and instituted Officers to inspect the Proceedings of Kings and to take care that the Laws were not violated Of this sort were the  Ephori  of  Sparta  the  Maires du Palais  and afterwards the Constable of  France  the  Justicia  in  Arragon  the  Rijcshofmeister  in  Denmark  the High Steward in  England  and in all places such Assemblys as are before mention'd under several names who had the Power of the whole Nation Some have continu'd long and it may be always in the same form others have chang'd it Some being incens'd against their Kings as the  Romans  exasperated by the Villanys of  Tarquin  and the  Tuscans  by the Crueltys of  Mezentius  abolish'd the name of King Others as  Athens Sicion Argos Corinth Thebes  and the  Latins  did not stay for such extremitys but set up other Governments when they thought it best for themselves and by this conduct prevented the evils that usually fall upon Nations when their Kings degenerate into Tyrants and a Nation is brought to enter into a War by which all may be lost and nothing can be gain'd which was not their own before The  Romans  took not this salutary Course the mischief was grown up before they perceiv'd or set themselves against it and when the effects of Pride Avarice Cruelty and Lust were grown to such a height that they could no longer be endur'd they could not free themselves without a War and whereas upon other occasions their Victorys had brought them increase of Strength Territory and Glory the only reward of their Vertue in this was to be deliver'd from a Plague they had unadvisedly suffer'd to grow up among them I confess this was most of all to be esteem'd for if they had bin overthrown their condition under  Tarquin  would have bin more intolerable than if they had fallen under the power of  Pirrhus  or  Hannibal  and all their following Prosperity was the fruit of their recover'd Liberty But it had bin much better to have reform'd the State after the death of one of their good Kings than to be brought to fight for their Lives against that abominable Tyrant Our Author in pursuance of his aversion to all that is good disapproves this and wanting reasons to justify his dislike according to the custom of Impostors and Cheats has recourse to the ugly terms of a  Backdoor Sedition  and  Faction  as if it were not as just for a People to lay aside their Kings when they receive nothing but evil and can rationally hope for no benefit by them as for others to set them up in expectation of good from them But if the truth be examin'd nothing will be found more orderly than the changes of Government or of the Persons and Races of those that govern'd which have bin made by many Nations When  Pharamond  's Grandson seem'd not to deserve the Crown he had worn the  French  gave it to  Meroveus  who more resembled him in Vertue In process of time when this Race also degenerated they were rejected and  Pepin  advanc'd to the Throne and the most remote in blood of his Descendents having often bin prefer'd before the nearest and Bastards before the legitimate Issue they were at last all laid aside and the Crown remains to this day in the Family of  Hugh Capet  upon whom it was bestow'd on the rejection of  Charles  of  Lorrain  In like manner the  Castilians  took  Don Sancho  sirnam'd the Brave second Son to  Alphonso  the  Wise before  Alphonso el Desheredado  Son of the elder Brother  Ferdinand  The States of  Arragon  prefer'd  Martin  Brother to  John  the first before  Mary  his Daughter marry'd to the Count  de Foix  tho Females were not excluded from the Succession and the House of  Austria  now enjoys that Crown from  Joan  Daughter to  Ferdinand  In that and many other Kingdoms Bastards have bin advanc'd before their legitimate Brothers  Henry  Count of  Trastamara  Bastard to  Alphonso  XI King of  Castile  receiv'd the Crown as a reward of the good Service he had done to his Country against his Brother  Peter  the Cruel without any regard had to the House of  La Cerda  descended from  Alphonso el Desheredado  which to this day never enjoy'd any greater honour than that of Duke  de Medina Celi  Not long after the  Portuguese  conceiving a dislike of their King  Ferdinand  and his Daughter marry'd to  John  King of  Castile  rejected her and her Uncle by the Father's side and gave the Crown to  John  a Knight of  Calatrava  and Bastard to an Uncle of  Ferdinand  their King About the beginning of this age the  Swedes  depos'd their King  Sigismund  for being a Papist and made  Charles  his Uncle King Divers Examples of the like nature in  England  have bin already mention'd All these transportations of Crowns were Acts perform'd by Assemblys of the three Estates in the several Kingdoms and these Crowns are to this day enjoy'd under Titles deriv'd from such as were thus brought in by the deposition or rejection of those who according to descent of blood had better Titles than the present Possessors The Acts therefore were lawful and good or they can have no Title at all and they who made 'em had a just power so to do  If our Author can draw any advantage from the resemblance of Regality that he finds in the  Roman  Consuls and  Athenian  Archons I shall without envy leave him the enjoyment of it but I am much mistaken if that dos not prove my assertion that those Governments  were compos'd of the three simple species  for if the Monarchical part was in them it cannot be deny'd that the Aristocratical was in the Senat or  Areopagi  and the Democratical in the People But he ought to have remember'd that if there was something of Monarchical in those Governments when they are said to have bin Popular there was something of Aristocratical and Democratical in those that were call'd Regal which justifys my proposition on both sides and shews that the denomination was taken from the part that prevail'd and if this were not so the Governments of  France Spain  and  Germany  might be call'd Democracys and those of  Rome  and  Athens  Monarchys because the People have a part in the one and an image of Monarchy was preserv'd in the other  If our Author will not allow the cases to be altogether equal I think he will find no other difference than that the Consuls and Archons were regularly made by the Votes of the consenting People and orderly resign'd their Power when the time was expir'd for which it was given whereas  Tarquin Dionysius Agathocles Nabis Phalaris Cesar  and almost all his Successors whom he takes for compleat Monarchs came in by violence fraud and corruption by the help of the worst men by the slaughter of the best and most commonly when the method was once establish'd by that of his Predecessor who if our Author says true was the Father of his Country and his also This was the root and foundation of the only Government that deserves praise this is that which stampt the divine character upon  Agathocles Dionysius  and  Cesar  and that had bestow'd the same upon  Manlius Marius  or  Catiline  if they had gain'd the Monarchys they affected But I suppose that such as  God has blest with better judgment and a due regard to Justice and Truth will say that all those who have attain'd to such greatness as destroys all manner of good in the places where they have set up themselves by the most detestable Villanys came in by a  backdoor  and that such Magistrats as were orderly chosen by a willing People were the true Shepherds who came in by the gate of the Sheepfold and might justly be call'd the Ministers of God so long as they perform'd their duty in providing for the good of the Nations committed to their charge  SECT XVII Good Governments admit of Changes in the Superstructures whilst the Foundations remain unchangeable  IF I go a step farther and confess the  Romans  made some changes in the outward Form of their Government I may safely say they did well in it and prosper'd by it After the Expulsion of the Kings the Power was chiefly in the Nobility who had bin Leaders of the People but it was necessary to humble them when they began to presume too much upon the advantages of their Birth and the City could never have bin great unless the Plebeians who were the Body of it and the main strength of their Armys had bin admitted to a participation of Honours This could not be done at the first They who had bin so vilely opprest by  Tarquin  and harass'd with making or cleansing Sinks were not then fit for Magistracys or the Command of Armys but they could not justly be excluded from them when they had men who in courage and conduct were equal to the best of the Patricians and it had bin absurd for any man to think it a disparagement to him to marry the Daughter of one whom he had obey'd as Dictator or Consul and perhaps follow'd in his Triumph  Rome  that was constituted for War and sought its Grandeur by that means could never have arriv'd to any considerable height if the People had not bin exercis'd in Arms and their Spirits rais'd to delight in Conquests and willing to expose themselves to the greatest fatigues and dangers to accomplish them Such men as these were not to be us'd like Slaves or opprest by the unmerciful hand of Usurers They who by their sweat and blood were to defend and enlarge the Territorys of the State were to be convinc'd they fought for themselves and they had reason to demand a Magistracy of their own vested with a Power that none might offend to maintain their Rights and to protect their Familys whilst they were abroad in the Armys These were the Tribuns of the People made as they call'd it  Sacrosancti  or inviolable and the creation of them was the most considerable Change that happen'd till the time of  Marius  who brought all into disorder The creation or abolition of Military Tribuns with Consular Power ought to be accounted as nothing for it imported little whether that Authority were exercis'd by two or by five That of the  Decemviri  was as little to be regarded they were intended only for a Year and tho new ones were created for another on pretence the Laws they were to frame could not be brought to perfection in so short a time yet they were soon thrown down from the Power they usurp'd and endeavour'd to retain contrary to Law The creation of Dictators was no novelty they  were made occasionally from the beginning and never otherwise than occasionally till  Julius Cesar  subverted all order and invading that supreme Magistracy by force  Jura omnium in se    usurp'd the Right which belong'd to all This indeed was a mortal Change even in root and principle All other Magistrats had bin created by the People for the publick good and always were within the power of those that had created them But  Cesar  coming in by force sought only the satisfaction of his own raging Ambition or that of the Soldiers whom he had corrupted to destroy their Country and his Successors governing for themselves by the help of the like Villains perpetually expos'd the Empire to be ravag'd by them But whatever opinion any man may have of the other Changes I dare affirm there are few or no Monarchys whose Historys are so well known to us as that of  Rome  which have not suffer'd Changes incomparably greater and more mischievous than those of  Rome  whilst it was free The  Macedonian  Monarchy fell into pieces immediately after the death of  Alexander  'Tis thought he perish'd by Poison His Wives Children and Mother were destroy'd by his own Captains The best of those who had escap'd his fury fell by the Sword of each other When the famous  Argyraspides  might have expected some Reward of their labours and a little rest in old age they were maliciously sent into the East by  Antigonus  to perish by hunger and misery after he had corrupted them to betray  Eumenes  No better fate attended the rest all was in confusion every one follow'd whom he pleas'd and all of them seem'd to be fill'd with such a rage that they never ceas'd from mutual slaughters till they were consum'd and their Kingdoms continu'd in perpetual Wars against each other till they all fell under the  Roman  Power The fortune of  Rome  was the same after it became a Monarchy Treachery Murder and Fury reign'd in every part there was no Law but Force he that could corrupt an Army thought he had a sufficient Title to the Empire by this means there were frequently three or four and at one time thirty several Pretenders who call'd themselves Emperors of which number he only reign'd that had the happiness to destroy all his Competitors and he himself continu'd no longer than till another durst attempt the destruction of him and his Posterity In this state they remain'd till the wasted and bloodless Provinces were possest by a multitude of barbarous Nations The Kingdoms establish'd by them enjoy'd as little Peace or Justice that of  France  was frequently divided into as many parts as the Kings of  Meroveus  or  Pepin  's Race had Children under the names of the Kingdoms of  Paris Orleans Soissons Arles Burgundy Austrasia  and others These were perpetually vex'd by the unnatural fury of Brothers or nearest Relations whilst the miserable Nobility and People were oblig'd to fight upon their foolish Quarrels till all fell under the power of the strongest This mischief was in some measure cur'd by a Law made in the time of  Hugh Capet  that the Kingdom should no more be divided But the  Appanages  as they call them granted to the King's Brothers with the several Dukedoms and Earldoms erected to please them and other great Lords produc'd frequently almost as bad effects This is testify'd by the desperate and mortal Factions that went under the names of  Burgundy  and  Orleans Armagnac  and  Orleans Montmorency  and  Guise  These were follow'd by those of the League and the Wars of the  Hugonots  They  were no sooner finish'd by the taking of  Rochel  but new ones began by the Intrigues of the Duke of  Orleans  Brother to  Lewis  the  th  and his Mother and pursu'd with that animosity by them that they put themselves under the protection of  Spain  To which may be added that the Houses of  Conde Soissons Montmorency Guise Vendosme Angouleme Bouillon Rohan Longueville Rochefocault Epernon  and I think I may say every one that is of great eminency in that Kingdom with the Citys of  Paris Bourdeaux  and many others in the space of these last fifty years have sided with the perpetual Enemys of their own Country  Again other great Alterations have happen'd within the same Kingdom The Races of Kings four times wholly chang'd Five Kings depos'd in less than Years after the death of  Charles  the Great The Offices of  Maire du Palais  and Constable erected and laid aside The great Dukedoms and Earldoms little inferior to Sovereign Principalitys establish'd and supprest The decision of all Causes and the execution of the Laws plac'd absolutely in the hands of the Nobility their Deputys Seneschals or ViceSeneschals and taken from them again Parliaments set up to receive Appeals from the other Courts and to judg sovereignly in all cases expresly to curb them The Power of these Parliaments after they had crush'd the Nobility brought so low that within the last twenty years they are made to register and give the Power of Laws to Edicts of which the Titles only are read to them and the General Assemblys of Estates that from the time of  Pepin  had the Power of the Nation in their hands are now brought to nothing and almost forgotten  Tho I mention these things 'tis not with a design of blaming them for some of them deserve it not and it ought to be consider'd that the Wisdom of man is imperfect and unable to foresee the Effects that may proceed from an infinite variety of Accidents which according to Emergences necessarily require new Constitutions to prevent or cure the mischiefs arising from them or to advance a good that at the first was not thought on And as the noblest work in which the Wit of man can be exercis'd were if it could be done to constitute a Government that should last for ever the next to that is to sute Laws to present Exigences and so much as is in the power of man to foresee And he that should resolve to persist obstinately in the way he first enter'd upon or to blame those who go out of that in which their Fathers had walk'd when they find it necessary dos as far as in him lies render the worst of Errors perpetual Changes therefore are unavoidable and the Wit of man can go no farther than to institute such as in relation to the Forces Manners Nature Religion or Interests of a People and their Neighbours are sutable and adequate to what is seen or apprehended to be seen And he who would oblige all Nations at all times to take the same course would prove as foolish as a Physician who should apply the same Medicin to all Distempers or an Architect that would build the same kind of House for all Persons without considering their Estates Dignitys the number of their Children or Servants the Time or Climate in which they live and many other Circumstances or which is if possible more sottish a General who should obstinately resolve always to make War in the same way and to draw up his Army in the same form without examining the nature number and strength of his own and his Enemys Forces or the advantages and disadvantages of the Ground But as there may be some universal Rules in Physick Architecture and Military Disciplin from which men ought never to depart so there are some in Politicks also  which ought always to be observ'd and wise Legislators adhering to them only will be ready to change all others as occasion may require in order to the publick Good This we may learn from  Moses  who laying the Foundation of the Law given to the  Israelites  in that Justice Charity and Truth which having its root in God is subject to no change left them the liberty of having Judges or no Judges Kings or no Kings or to give the Sovereign Power to High Priests or Captains as best pleas'd themselves and the Mischiefs they afterwards suffer'd proceeded not simply from changing but changing for the worse The like judgment may be made of the Alterations that have happen'd in other places They who aim at the publick Good and wisely institute means proportionable and adequate to the attainment of it deserve praise and those only are to be dislik'd who either foolishly or maliciously set up a corrupt private Interest in one or a few men Whosoever therefore would judg of the  Roman  Changes may see that expelling the  Tarquins  creating Consuls abating the violence of Usurers admitting  Plebeians  to marry with the  Patricians  rendring them capable of Magistracys deducing Colonys dividing Lands gain'd from their Enemys erecting Tribuns to defend the Rights of the Commons appointing the  Decemviri  to regulate the Law and abrogating their Power when they abus'd it creating Dictators and Military Tribuns with a Consular Power as occasions requir'd they acted in the face of the Sun for the good of the Publick and such Acts having always produc'd Effects sutable to the rectitude of their Intentions they consequently deserve praise But when another Principle began to govern all things were chang'd in a very different manner Evil Designs tending only to the advancement of private Interests were carry'd on in the dark by means as wicked as the end If  Tarquin  when he had a mind to be King poison'd his first Wife and his Brother contracted an incestuous Marriage with his second by the death of her first Husband murder'd her Father and the best men in  Rome  yet  Cesar  did worse He favour'd  Catiline  and his villanous Associats brib'd and corrupted Magistrats conspir'd with  Crassus  and  Pompey  continu'd in the Command of an Army beyond the time prescrib'd by Law and turn'd the Arms with which he had bin intrusted for the service of the Commonwealth to the destruction of it which was rightly represented by his Dream that he had constuprated his Mother In the like manner when  Octavius Antonius  and  Lepidus  divided the Empire and then quarrel'd among themselves and when  Galba Otho Vitellius  and  Vespasian  set up Partys in several Provinces all was manag'd with Treachery Fraud and Cruelty nothing was intended but the advancement of one Man and the Recompence of the Villains that serv'd him And when the Empire had suffer'd infinite Calamitys by pulling down or rejecting one and setting up another it was for the most part difficult to determin who was the worst of the two or whether the prevailing side had gain'd or lost by their Victory The question therefore upon which a Judgment may be made to the praise or dispraise of the  Roman  Government before or after the loss of their Liberty ought not to be Whether either were subject to changes for neither they nor any thing under the Sun was ever exempted from them but whether the Changes that happen'd after the establishment of Absolute Power in the Emperors did not solely proceed from Ambition and tend to the publick Ruin whereas those Alterations related by our Author concerning Consuls Dictators  Decemviri  Tribunes and Laws were far more rare less violent tending to and procuring the publick Good and therefore  deserving praise The like having bin prov'd by the Examples of other Kingdoms and might be farther confirm'd by many more which on account of brevity I omit is in my opinion sufficient to manifest that whilst the Foundation and Principle of a Government remains good the Superstructures may be chang'd according to occasions without any prejudice to it  SECT XVIII  Xenophon  in blaming the Disorders of Democracys favours Aristocracys not Monarchys  IN the next place our Author introduces  Xenophon disallowing Popular Governments  Cites  Rome  and  Athens  as Places  where the best Men thriv'd worst and the worst best  and condemns the  Romans  for making it capital to pass Sentence  of Death Banishment loss of Liberty or Stripes upon any Citizen of  Rome But lest his Fraud in this should be detected he cites no precise Passage of any Author alledges few Examples and those mistaken never tells us what that Law was when made or where to be found whereas I hope to prove that he has upon the whole matter abominably prevaricated and advanc'd things that he knows to be either impertinent or false  To this end we are in the first place to consider whether  Xenophon  speaks of Popular Governments simply or comparatively if simply 'tis confest that a pure Democracy can never be good unless for a small Town if comparatively we must examin to what he compares it We are sure it was not to Absolute Monarchy there was no such thing amongst the  Greeks  establish'd by Law The little Tyrants who had enslav'd their own Countrys as  Jason Phaereus Phalaris  and the like had no pretence to it and were accounted as the worst of Beasts None but such as in all bestiality were like to 'em did ever speak or think well of them  Xenophon  's Opinion in this point may be easily found out by what pass'd between his Master  Plato  and the  Sicilian  Tyrant and the matter will not be mended by referring to his own experience He had seen the vast Monarchy of  Persia  torn in pieces by the fury of two Brothers and more than a million of men brought to fight upon their private quarrel Instead of that Order Stability and Strength which our Author ascribes to Absolute Monarchy as the effect of Wisdom and Justice he knew that by filling one man with pride and cruelty it brought unspeakable miserys upon all others and infected 'em with all the Vices that accompany Slavery Men liv'd like Fishes the great ones devour'd the small and as appear'd by  Tissaphernes Pharnabazus  and others with whom he had to deal the worst and basest were made to be the greatest The  Satrapes  insulted over those of meaner rank with an insolence and cruelty that equal'd the depth of their servil submission to their proud Master Luxury and Avarice reign'd in all many great Nations were made to live for the service of one man and to foment his Vices This produc'd weakness and cowardice no number of those Slaves were able to stand against a few free  Grecians  No man knew this better than  Xenophon  who after the death of  Cyrus  the younger and the treacherous murder of  Clearchus  and other Officers that commanded the  Greeks  who  had serv'd him made his retreat from  Babylon  to the  Hellespont  with ten thousand foot and passed over the bellys of all that dar'd to oppose him He would never have spent his life in exciting his Countrymen to attempt the Conquest of  Asia  nor persuaded  Agesilaus  to put himself at the head of the Enterprize if he had thought there was such admirable Order Stability and Strength in that Monarchy and in the  Greeks  nothing but  giddiness of Spirit and so much Learning as made them seditious  Nor could he being a wise man and an excellent Captain have conceiv'd such a design if he had not by experience found that Liberty inspir'd his Countrymen with such solid Vertue and produc'd such Stability good Order and Strength that with small numbers of them he might hope to overthrow the vain Pomp of the  Barbarians  and to possess himself of their Riches tho they could bring more than a hundred men to fight against one which Design being interrupted in his time by domestick Wars was soon after his death accomplish'd by  Alexander  But that  Xenophon  's meaning may be better understood 'tis good to consider that he spoke of such Governments as were then in use among the  Greeks  which tho mix'd yet took their denomination from the prevailing part so that the  Dorians  who plac'd the Power chiefly in the hands of a few chosen men were said to be govern'd Aristocratically and the  Ionians  giving more Power to the common People Democratically And he tho an  Ionian  either thro friendship to  Agesilaus  conversation with the  Spartans  or for other reasons best known to himself prefer'd the Government of  Sparta  or some other which he thought he could frame and desir'd to introduce before that of  Athens  as  Cimon Thucydides  and many other excellent men of that City are said to have done And if I acknowledg they were in the right and that  Athens  was more subject to disorder and had less Stability than  Sparta  I think it will be of little advantage to Absolute Monarchy  The  Athenians  did banish some worthy men and put others to death but our Author like the Devil never speaking truth unless to turn it into a lie prevaricates in his report of them The temporary banishment which they call'd  Ostracism  was without hurt or dishonour never accounted as a Punishment nor intended for any other end than to put a stop to the too eminent greatness of a man that might prove dangerous to the City and some excellent Persons who fell under it were soon recall'd and brought home with glory But I am not solicitous whether that reason be sufficient to justify it or not We are upon a general  Thesis  relating to the Laws of God and Nature and if the  Athenians  by a fancy of their own did make an imprudent use of their Liberty it cannot prejudice the publick Cause They who make the worst of it can only say that by such means they for a time depriv'd themselves of the benefits they might have receiv'd from the Vertues of some excellent men to the hurt of none but themselves and the application of it as an injustice done to  Themistocles  is absolutely false He was a man of great Wit Industry and Valour but of uncertain Faith too much addicted to his  Plut in vit Themist  own Interest and held a most dangerous Correspondence with the  Persians  who then threaten'd the destruction of  Greece  Thro envy and spite to  Aristides  and to increase his own Power he rais'd dangerous Factions in the City and being summon'd to render an account of his Proceedings he declin'd the Judgment of his Country fled to their Enemys and justly deserv'd the Sentence pronounc'd against him Some among them were unjustly put to death and above all  Socrates  but the People  who deceiv'd by false Witnesses against whom neither the Laws of God or Man have ever prescrib'd a sufficient defence had condemn'd him did so much lament their Crime when the truth was discover'd to them that I doubt whether a more righteous Judgment had given better testimony of their righteous Intentions But our Author's impudence appears in the highest excess in imputing the death of  Phocion  to the popular State of  Athens  Their Forces had bin broken in the  Sicilian  War the City taken and the principal Men slain by  Lysander  the remains of the most Worthy destroy'd by the thirty Tyrants set up by him their illrecover'd Liberty overthrown by the  Macedonians  and the death of  Phocion  compast by  Polyperchon  who with Foreign Soldiers Slaves Vagabonds and Outlaws overpower'd the People  The proceedings of  Rome  may be more compleatly justify'd  Coriolanus  was duly condemn'd he set too great a price upon his own Valour and arrogated to himself a Power in  Rome  which would hardly have bin indur'd in  Corioli  His violence and pride overbalanc'd his Services and he that would submit to no Law was justly driven out from the Society which could subsist only by Law  Quintius  was not unlike him and  Manlius Capitolinus  far worse than either Their Vertues were not to be consider'd when they departed from them Consideration ought to be had of human frailty and some indulgence may be extended to those who commit Errors after having done important Services but a State cannot subsist which compensating evil Actions with good gives impunity to the most dangerous Crimes in remembrance of any Services whatever He that dos well performs his Duty and ought always to do so Justice and Prudence concur in this and 'tis no less just than profitable that every Action be consider'd by it self and such a reward or punishment allotted to it as in nature and proportion it best deserves  This as I suppose is enough for their Cases but relates not to those of  Mamercus Camillus Livius Salinator  and  Emylius Paulus  their Vertue was compleat they were wrongfully sentenc'd But the best Princes Senat or People that ever was in the world by the deceit of evil men may and have bin drawn out of the way of Justice Yet of all the States that are known to us none was ever so free from Crimes of malice and wilful injustice none was ever guilty of so few Errors as that of  Rome  and none did ever give better testimonys of Repentance when they were discover'd than the  Romans  did by the Veneration they shew'd to those worthy Persons and the Honors they confer'd upon them afterwards  Liv  Mamercus  was made Dictator to repair the unjust mark of Infamy laid upon him by the Censors  Camillus  being recall'd from his banishment often enjoy'd the same honour and died the most reverenc'd Man that had ever bin in that City  Livius Salinator  was not only made Consul after he had bin fin'd but the People as it were to expiate the guilt of having condemn'd him suffer'd that asperity of speech and manners which might have persuaded such as had bin less confident of his Vertue and their own that he desir'd to be reveng'd tho it were with the ruin of the City They dealt in the like manner with  Paulus Emylius  repairing the injury of a Fine unduly impos'd Their generosity in leaving the Tribuns in the  Forum  with their Accusation against  Scipio Africanus  and following him to celebrate an annual Sacrifice in the Capitol in commemoration of his victory against  Hannibal  was no less admirable than the greatness of his mind who thought his Vertue should be so well known  that no account ought to be expected from him which was an Error proceeding from a noble Root but not to be born in a wellgovern'd Commonwealth The Laws that aim at the publick Good make no distinction of Persons and none can be exempted from the Penaltys of them otherwise than by approv'd Innocence which cannot appear without a Trial He that will not bend his mind to them shakes off the equality of a Citizen and usurps a Power above the Law to which no man submits upon any other condition than that none should be exempted from the power of it And  Scipio  being the first  Roman  that thus disdain'd the Power of the Law I do not know whether the prejudice brought upon the City by so dangerous an Example did not outweigh all the Services he had done Nevertheless the people contented with his retirement to his own house and afterwards convinc'd of his Innocence would probably if he had not dy'd in a few months have brought him back with the Honours that Fate reserv'd for his ashes  I do not at present remember any other eminent men who can be said in any respect to have  thriv'd ill  whilst the People and Senat of  Rome  acted freely and if this be not sufficient to clear the point I desire to know the names of those  worst men that thriv'd best  If they may have bin judg'd to thrive who were frequently advanc'd to the supreme Magistracys and enjoy'd the chief Honors I find no men so eminent as  Brutus Publicola Quintius Cincinnatus  and  Capitolinus  the two  Fabii  sirnam'd  Maximi Corvinus Torquatus Camillus  and the like and if these were the worst Men that  Rome  produc'd in those Ages Valor Wisdom Industry in the Service of their Country and a most intire Love to it must have bin the worst of qualitys and I presume our Author may have thought them so since they were invincible obstacles to the introduction of that Divine Monarchy which  Appius Claudius  the Decemvir  Manlius Capitolinus Spurius Cassius Sp Melius  and some others may be thought to have affected  However these instances are not to be understood as they are simply in themselves but comparatively with what has happen'd in other places under absolute Monarchys for our inquiry is not after that which is perfect well knowing that no such thing is found among men but we seek that human Constitution which is attended with the least or the most pardonable inconveniences And if we find that in the space of three hundred years while the Senat People and legally created Magistrats govern'd  Rome  not one worthy Man was put to death not above five or six condemn'd to Fines by the beguil'd People and those injurys repair'd by the most honourable satisfaction that could be given so that Vertue continu'd ever flourishing the best men that could be found were put into the chief Commands and the City was fill'd with more excellent men than were ever known to be in any other place And on the other side if the Emperors so soon as the Government was chang'd made it their business to destroy the best and so far succeeded in their design that they left none and never fail'd to advance the worst unless it fell out as to Queen  Katherine de Medicis  who is said never to have done any good but by mistake and some few may have prov'd better than was intended it will appear that our Author's Assertions are in the utmost degree false Of this we need no better witness than  Tacitus  The Civil Wars and the Proscriptions upon which he touches are justly to be attributed to that Monarchy which was then setting up the only question being who should be the Monarch when the Liberty was already overthrown  And if any eminent Men escap'd it was much against the will of those who had usurp'd the Power He acknowledges his Historys to be a continu'd relation of the slaughter of the most illustrious Persons and that in the times of which he writes Vertue was attended with certain destruction After the death of  Germanicus  and his eldest Children  Valerius Asiaticus Seneca Corbulo  and an infinite number more who were thought most to resemble them found this to be true at the expence of their lives  Nero  in pursuance of the same tyrannical design murder'd  Helvidius  and  Thraseas  that he might  Ipsam exscindere virtutem  Tacit  tear up Vertue by the roots Domitian  spar'd none willingly that had either Vertue or Reputation and tho  Trajan  with perhaps some other might grow up under him in the remote Provinces yet no good Man could escape who came under his eye and was so eminent as to be observ'd by him Whilst these who were thought to be the best Men that appear'd in the  Roman  Empire did  thrive  in this manner  Sejanus Macro Narcissus Pallas Tigellinus Icetus Vinnius Laco  and others like to 'em had the power of the Empire in their hands Therefore unless Mankind has bin mistaken to this day and that these who have hitherto bin accounted the worst of Villains were indeed the best Men in the world and that those destroy'd by them who are thought to have bin the best were truly the worst it cannot be deny'd that the best Men during the Liberty of  Rome thriv'd  best that good Men suffer'd no indignity unless by some fraud impos'd upon the wellmeaning People and that so soon as the Liberty was subverted the worst men  thriv'd  best The best Men were expos'd to so many Calamitys and Snares that it was thought a matter of great wonder to see a vertuous man die in his bed and if the account were well made I think it might appear that every one of the Emperors before  Titus  shed more noble and innocent Blood than  Rome  and all the Commonwealths in the world have done whilst they had the free enjoyment of their own Liberty But if any man in favour of our Author seeks to diminish the vast disproportion between the two differing sorts of Government and imputes the disorders that happen'd in the time of the  Gracchi  and others whilst  Rome  was strugling for her Liberty to the Government of a Commonwealth he will find them no more to be compar'd with those that fell out afterwards than the railings of a turbulent Tribune against the Senat to the Villanys and Crueltys that corrupted and dispeopl'd the Provinces from  Babylon  to  Scotland  And whereas the State never fail'd to recover from any disorders as long as the Root of Liberty remain'd untouch'd and became more powerful and glorious than ever even after the Wars of  Marius  and  Sylla  when that was destroy'd the City fell into a languishing condition and grew weaker and weaker till that and the whole Empire was ruin'd by the Barbarians  Our Author to shew that his memory is as good as his judgment having represented  Rome  in the times of Liberty as a publick Slaughterhouse soon after blames the clemency of their Laws whereas 'tis impossible that the same City could at the same time be guilty of those contrary extremitys and no less certain that it was perfectly free from them both  Sallust Bell Catilin  His assertion seems to be grounded upon  Cesar  's Speech related by  Sallust  in favour of  Lentulus  and  Cethegus  Companions of  Catiline  but tho he there endeavour'd to put the best colour he could upon their cause it signify'd only thus much that a  Roman  Citizen could not be put to death  without being heard in publick which Law will displease none that in understanding and integrity may not be compar'd to  Filmer  and his Followers 'Tis a folly to extend it farther for 'tis easily prov'd that there was always a power of putting Citizens to death and that it was exercis'd when occasion requir'd The Laws were the same in the time of the Kings when that Office was executed by Consuls excepting such changes as are already mention'd The  Lex perduellionis  cited by  Livy  in the case of  Horatius  who had kill'd his Sister continu'd in force from the foundation to the end of that Government the condemnation was to death the words of the Sentence these  Caput obnubito infelici arbore reste suspendito verberato intra Pomaerium vel extra Pomaerium  He was try'd by this Law upon an appeal made to the People by his Father and absolv'd  admiratione magis virtutis quam jure causae  which could not have bin if by the Law no Citizen might be put to death The Sons of  Brutus  were condemn'd to death in publick and executed with the  Aquilii  and  Vitellii  their Companions in the same Conspiracy  Manlius Capitolinus  was put to death by the vote of the People  Titus Manlius  by the command of his Father  Torquatus  for fighting without order Two Legions were decimated by  Appius Claudius Spurius Melius  refusing to appear before the Dictator was kill'd by  Servilius Ahala  General of the Horse and pronounc'd  jure caesum Quintus Fabius  was by  Papirius  the Dictator condemn'd to die and could not have bin sav'd but by the intercession and authority of the People If this be not so I desire to be inform'd what the Senat meant by condemning  Nero  to be put to death  more majorum  if  more majorum  no Citizen might be put to death Why the Consuls Dictators Military Tribuns  Decemviri  caus'd Rods and Axes to be carry'd before them as well within as without the City if no use was to be made of 'em Were they only vain Badges of a Power never to be executed or upon whom was the Supreme Power signify'd by them to be exercis'd within and without the City if the Citizens were not subject to it 'Tis strange that a man who had ever read a Book of matters relating to the Affairs of  Rome  should fancy these things or hope to impose them upon the World if he knew them to be foolish false and absurd But of all the marks of a most supine stupidity that can be given by a man I know none equal to this of our Author who in the same Clause wherein he says no Citizen could be put to death or banish'd adds that the Magistrats were upon pain of death forbidden to do it for if a Magistrate might be put to death for banishing a Citizen or causing him to be executed a Citizen might be put to death for the Magistrats were not Strangers but Citizens If this was not so he must think that no Crime was capital but the punishment of capital Crimes or that no man was subject to the Supreme Power but he that was created for the execution of it Yet even this will not stop the gap for the Law that condemn'd the Magistrate to die could be of no effect if there were no man to execute it and there could be none if the Law prohibited it or that he who did it was to die for it And this goes on to infinity For if a Magistrate could not put a Citizen to death I suppose a Citizen could not put to death a Magistrate for he also is a Citizen So that upon the whole matter we may conclude that Malice is blind and that Wickedness is Madness 'Tis hard to say more in praise of Popular Governments than will result from what he says against them his reproaches are Praises and his Praises reproaches As Government is instituted for the preservation of the Governed the  Romans  were sparing  of Blood and are wisely commended by  Livy  for it  Nulli unquam Populo mitiores placuere poenae  which gentleness will never be blam'd unless by those who are pleas'd with nothing so much as the fury of those Monsters who with the ruin of the best part of Mankind usurp'd the dominion of that glorious City But if the  Romans  were gentle in punishing Offences they were also diligent in preventing them the excellence of their Disciplin led the Youth to Vertue and the Honors they receiv'd for recompence confirm'd them in it By this means many of 'em became Laws to themselves and they who were not the most excellent were yet taught so much of good that they had a veneration for those they could not equal which not only ferv'd to incite them to do well according to their Talents but kept them in such a w as to fear incurring their ill opinion by any bad action as much as by the penalty of the Law This integrity of manners made the Laws as it were useless and whilst they seem'd to sleep ignorant persons thought there were none But their Disciplin being corrupted by Prosperity those Vices came in which made way for the Monarchy and Wickedness being plac'd in the Throne there was no safety for any but such as would be of the same spirit and the Empire was ruin'd by it  SECT XIX That Corruption and Venality which is natural to Courts is seldom found in Popular Governments  OUR Author's next work is with that modesty and truth which is natural to him to impute Corruption and Venality to Commonwealths He knows that Monarchys are exempted from those evils and has discover'd this truth from the integrity observ'd in the modern Courts of  England France  and  Spain  or the more antient of  Rome  and  Persia  But after many falshoods in matter of fact and misrepresentations of that which is true he shews that the Corruption Venality and Violence he blames were neither the effects of Liberty nor consistent with it  Cneius Manlius  who with his  Asiatic  Army brought in the Luxury that gave birth to those mischiefs did probably follow the looseness of his own disposition yet the best and wisest men of that time knew from the beginning that it would ruin the City unless a stop might be put to the course of that evil But they who had seen Kings under their feet and could no longer content themselves with that equality which is necessary among Citizens fomented it as the chief means to advance their ambitious designs Tho  Marius  was rigid in his nature and car'd neither for Mony nor sensual Pleasures yet he favour'd those Vices in others and is said to be the first that made use of 'em to his advantage  Catiline  was one of the leudest men in the world and had no other way of compassing his designs than by rendring others as bad as himself and  Cesar  set up his Tyranny by spreading that corruption farther than the others had bin able to do and tho he  Caligula  and some others were slain yet the best men found it as impossible to restore Liberty to the City when it was corrupted as the worst had done to set up a Tyranny whilst the integrity of their manners did continue Men have a strange propensity to run into all manner of excesses when plenty of means invite and there  is no power to deter of which the succeeding Emperors took advantage and knowing that even their subsistence depended upon it they thought themselves oblig'd by interest as well as inclination to make Honors and Preferments the rewards of Vice and tho it be not always true in the utmost extent that all men follow the example of the King yet it is of great efficacy Tho some are so good that they will not be perverted and others so bad that they will not be corrected yet a great number dos always follow the course that is favour'd and rewarded by those that govern There were Idolaters doubtless among the  Jews  in the days of  David  and  Hezekiah  but they prosper'd better under  Jeroboam  and  Ahab England  was not without Papists in the time of Queen  Elizabeth  but they thriv'd much better during the Reign of her furious Sister False Witnesses and Accusers had a better trade under  Tiberias  who call'd them  Custodes Legum  than under  Trajan  who abhor'd them and Whores Players and Fidlers with other such Vermin abounded certainly more when encourag'd by  Nero  than when despis'd by  Antoninus  and  Marcus Aurelius  But as every one of these manifested what he was by those he favor'd or punish'd and that a man can only be judg'd by his principles or practices he that would know whether absolute Monarchys or mix'd Governments do most foment or punish Venality and Corruption ought to examin the principle and practice of both and compare them one with the other  As to the Principle the abovemention'd Vices may be profitable to ptivate men but they can never be so to the Government if it be popular or mix'd No People was ever the better for that which renders them weak or base and a duly created Magistracy governing a Nation with their consent can have no interest distinct from that of the Publick or desire to diminish the strength of the People which is their own and by which they subsist On the other side the absolute Monarch who governs for himself and chiefly seeks his own preservation looks upon the strength and bravery of his Subjects as the root of his greatest danger and frequently desires to render them weak base corrupt and unfaithful to each other that they may neither dare to attempt the breaking of the Yoke he lays upon them nor trust one another in any generous design for the recovery of their Liberty So that the same corruption which preserves such a Prince if it were introduc'd by a People would weaken if not utterly destroy them  Again all things have their continuance from a principle in Nature sutable to their Original all Tyrannys have had their beginnings from corruption The Historys of  Greece Sicily  and  Italy  shew that all those who made themselves Tyrants in several places did it by the help of the worst and the slaughter of the best Men could not be made subservient to their Lusts whilst they continu'd in their integrity so as their business was to destroy those who would not be corrupted They must therefore endeavour to maintain or increase the corruption by which they attain their greatness If they fail in this point they must fall as  Tarquin Pisistratus  and others have done but if they succeed so far that the vicious part do much prevail the Government is secure tho the Prince may be in danger And the same thing dos in a great measure accidentally conduce to the safety of his Person For they who for the most part are the Authors of great Revolutions not being so much led by a particular hatred to the Man as by a desire to do good to the Publick seldom set themselves to conspire against the Tyrant unless he be altogether detestable  and intolerable if they do not hope to overthrow the Tyranny  The contrary is seen in all popular and wellmix'd Governments they are ever establish'd by wise and good men and can never be upheld otherwise than by Vertue The worst men always conspiring against them they must fall if the best have not power to preserve them Wheresoever therefore a People is so govern'd the Magistrats will obviate afar off the introduction of Vices which tend as much to the ruin of their Persons and Government as to the preservation of the Prince and his This is evidenc'd by experience 'Tis not easy to name a Monarch that had so many good qualitys as  Julius Cesar  till they were extinguish'd by his Ambition which was inconsistent with them He knew that his strength lay in the corruption of the People and that he could not accomplish his designs without increasing it He did not seek good men but such as would be for him and thought none sufficiently addicted to his Interests but such as stuck at the performance of no wickedness that he commanded he was a Soldier according to  Cesar  's heart who said  Pectore si fratris gladium jugulo{que} parentis  Condere me jubeas gravidaeve in viscera partu  Conjugis invita peragam tamen omnia dextra  Lucan  And lest such as were devoted to him should grow faint in Villany he industriously inflam'd their fury  Vult omnia Caesar  A se saeva peti vult praemia Martis amari  Ib  Having spread this Poison amongst the Soldiers his next work was by corrupting the Tribuns to turn that Power to the destruction of the People which had bin erected for their preservation and pouring the Treasures he had gain'd by rapine in  Gaul  into the Bosom of  Curio  made him an instrument of mischief who had bin a most eminent Supporter of the Laws Tho he was thought to have affected the glory of sparing  Cato  and with trouble to have found that he despis'd life when it was to be accounted his gift yet in suspecting  Brutus  and  Cassius  he shew'd he could not believe that vertuous men who lov'd their Country could be his Friends Such as carry on the like designs with less Valor Wit and Generosity of Spirit will always be more bitterly bent to destroy all that are good knowing that the deformity of their own Vices is render'd most manifest when they are compar'd with the good qualitys of those who are most unlike them and that they can never defend themselves against the scorn and hatred they incur by their Vices unless such a number can be infected with the same and made to delight in the recompences of iniquity that foment them as may be able to keep the rest of the People in subjection  The same thing happens even when the Usurpation is not so violent as that of  Agathocles Dionysius  or the last King of  Denmark  who in one day by the strength of a mercenary Soldiery overthrew all the Laws of his Country and a lawfully created Magistrate is forc'd to follow the same ways as soon as he begins to affect a Power which the Laws do not confer upon him I wish I could say there were few of these but experience shews that such a proportion of Wisdom moderation of Spirit and Justice is requir'd in a supreme Magistrate to render him content with a  limited Power as is seldom found Man is of an aspiring nature and apt to put too high a value upon himself they who are rais'd above their Brethren tho but a little desire to go farther and if they gain the name of King they think themselves wrong'd and degraded when they are not suffer'd to do what they  Sanctitas pietas sides  Privata bona sunt Qua juvat reges eant  Senec Thyest  please In these things they never want Masters and the nearer they come to a Power that is not easily restrain'd by Law the more passionately they desire to abolish all that opposes it and when their Hearts are fill'd with this fury they never fail to chuse such Ministers as will be subservient to their Will and this is so well known that those only approach them who resolve to be so Their interests as well as their inclinations incite them to diffuse their own manners as far as they can which is no less than to bring those who are under their power to all that wickedness of which the nature of man is capable and no greater testimony can be given of the efficacy of these means towards the utter corruption of Nations than the accursed effects we see of 'em in our own and the neighboring Countrys  It may be said that some Princes are so full of Vertue and Goodness as not to desire more power than the Laws allow and are not oblig'd to chuse ill men because they desire nothing but what the best are willing to do This may be and sometimes is the Nation is happy that has such a King but he is hard to find and more than a human Power is requir'd to keep him in so good a way The strength of his own affections will ever be against him Wives Children and Servants will always join with those Enemys that arise in his own breast to pervert him if he has any weak side any Lust unsubdu'd they will gain the victory He has not search'd into the nature of Man who thinks that any one can resist when he is thus on all sides assaulted Nothing but the wonderful and immediate power of God's Spirit can preserve him and to alledg it will be nothing to the purpose unless it can be prov'd that all Princes are blest with such an assistance or that God has promis'd it to them and their Successors for ever by what means soever they came to the Crowns they enjoy  Nothing is farther from my intention than to speak irreverently of Kings and I presume no wise man will think I do so if I profess that having observ'd as well as I can what History and daily Experience teach us concerning the Vertues and Religions that are or have bin from the beginning of the World encourag'd and supported by Monarchs the methods they have follow'd since they have gone under the name of Christians their moral as well as theological Graces together with what the Scriptures tell us of those who in the last days will principally support the Throne of Antichrist I cannot be confident that they are generally in an extraordinary manner preserv'd by the hand of God from the Vices and Frailtys to which the rest of mankind is subject If no man can shew that I am in this mistaken I may conclude that as they are more than any other men in the world expos'd to temptations and snares they are more than any in danger of being corrupted and made Instruments of corrupting others if they are no otherwise defended than the rest of men  This being the state of the matter on both sides we may easily collect that all Governments are subject to corruption and decay but with this difference that Absolute Monarchy is by principle led unto or rooted  in it whereas mix'd or popular Governments are only in a possibility of falling into it As the first cannot subsist unless the prevailing part of the people be corrupted the other must certainly perish unless preserv'd in a great measure free from Vices And I doubt whether any better reason can be given why there have bin and are more Monarchys than popular Governments in the world than that Nations are more easily drawn into corruption than defended from it and I think that Monarchy can be said to be natural in no other sense than that our deprav'd Nature is most inclin'd to that which is worst  To avoid unnecessary Disputes I give the name of Popular Governments to those of  Rome Athens Sparta  and the like tho improperly unless the same may also be given to many that are usually called Monarchys since there is nothing of violence in either the Power is confer'd upon the chief Magistrats of both by the free consent of a willing People and such a part as they think fit is still retain'd and executed in their own Assemblys and in this sense it is that our Author seems to speak against them As to Popular Government in the strictest sense that is pure Democracy where the People in themselves and by themselves perform all that belong to Government I know of no such thing and if it be in the World have nothing to say for it In asserting the Liberty generally as I suppose granted by God to all mankind I neither deny that so many as think fit to enter into a Society may give so much of their Power as they please to one or more men for a time or perpetually to them and their Heirs according to such Rules as they prescribe nor approve the Disorders that must arise if they keep it intirely in their own hands And looking upon the several Governments which under different forms and names have bin regularly constituted by Nations as so many undeniable Testimonys that they thought it good for themselves and their Posterity so to do I infer that as there is no man who would not rather chuse to be govern'd by such as are just industrious valiant and wise than by those that are wicked slothful cowardly and foolish and to live in society with such as are qualify'd like those of the first sort rather than with those who will be ever ready to commit all manner of Villanys or want experience strength or courage to join in repelling the Injurys offer'd by others So there are none who do not according to the measure of their understanding endeavour to set up those who seem to be best qualify'd and to prevent the introduction of those Vices which render the Faith of the Magistrate suspected or make him unable to perform his duty in providing for the execution of Justice and the publick defence of the State against Foreign or Domestick Enemys For as no man who is not absolutely mad will commit the care of a Flock to a Villain that has neither skill diligence nor courage to defend them or perhaps is maliciously set to destroy them rather than to a stout faithful and wise Shepherd 'tis less to be imagin'd that any would commit the same error in relation to that Society which comprehends himself with his Children Friends and all that is dear to him  The same Considerations are of equal force in relation to the Body of every Nation For since the Magistrate tho the most perfect in his kind cannot perform his duty if the people be so base vicious effeminate and cowardly as not to second his good Intentions those who expect good from him cannot desire so to corrupt their Companions that are to help him as to render it impossible for him to accomplish it Tho I believe there have bin in all Ages bad men in every Nation yet I doubt whether there was  one in  Rome  except a  Catiline  or a  Cesar  who design'd to make themselves Tyrants that would not rather have wish'd the whole People as brave and vertuous as in the time of the  Carthaginian  Wars than vile and base as in the days of  Nero  and  Domitian  But 'tis madness to think that the whole Body would not rather wish to be as it was when Vertue flourish'd and nothing upon Earth was able to resist their power than weak miserable base slavish and trampled under foot by any that would invade them and forc'd as a Chattel to become a prey to those that were strongest Which is sufficient to shew that a People acting according to the liberty of their own Will never advance unworthy men unless it be by mistake nor willingly suffer the introduction of Vices Whereas the Absolute Monarch always prefers the worst of those who are addicted to him and cannot subsist unless the prevailing part of the People be base and vicious  If it be said that those Governments in which the Democratical part governs most do more frequently err in the choice of men or the means of preserving that purity of Manners which is requir'd for the wellbeing of a People than those wherein Aristocracy prevails I confess it and that in  Rome  and  Athens  the best and wisest men did for the most part incline to Aristocracy  Xenophon Plato Aristotle Thucydides Livy Tacitus Cicero  and others were of this sort But if our Author there seek Patrons for his Absolute Monarchy he will find none but  Phalaris Agathocles Dionysius Catiline Cethegus Lentulus  with the corrupted Crew of mercenary Rascals who did or endeavor'd to set 'em up These are they  quibus ex honesto nulla est spes  they abhor the Dominion of the Law because it curbs their Vices and make themselves subservient to the Lusts of a man who may nourish them Similitude of Interests Manners and Designs is a link of Union between them Both are Enemys to popular and mix'd Government and those Governments are Enemys to them and by preserving Vertue and Integrity oppose both knowing that if they do not they and their Governments must certainly perish  SECT XX Man's natural love to Liberty is temper'd by Reason which originally is his Nature  THAT our Author's Book may appear to be a heap of Incongruitys and Contradictions 'tis not amiss to add to what has already bin observ'd that having asserted Absolute Monarchy to be  the only natural Government  he now says  that the nature of all People is to desire Liberty without restraint  But if Monarchy be that Power which above all restrains Liberty and subjects all to the Will of one this is as much as to say that all People naturally desire that which is against Nature and by a wonderful excess of extravagance and folly to assert contrary Propositions that on both sides are equally absurd and false For as we have already prov'd that no Government is impos'd upon men by God or Nature 'tis no less evident that Man being a rational Creature nothing can be universally natural to him that is not rational But this Liberty without restraint being inconsistent with any Government and the  Good which man naturally desires for himself Children and Friends we find no place in the world where the Inhabitants do not enter into some kind of Society or Government to restrain it and to say that all men desire Liberty without restraint and yet that all do restrain it is ridiculous The truth is man is hereunto led by Reason which is his Nature Every one sees they cannot well live asunder nor many together without some Rule to which all must submit This submission is a restraint of Liberty but could be of no effect as to the Good intended unless it were general nor general unless it were natural When all are born to the same freedom some will not resign that which is their own unless others do the like This general consent of all to resign such a part of their Liberty as seems to be for the good of all is the voice of Nature and the act of Men according to natural Reason seeking their own Good And if all go not in the same way according to the same form 'tis an evident testimony that no one is directed by Nature but as a few or many may join together and frame smaller or greater Societys so those Societys may institute such an order or form of Government as best pleases themselves and if the ends of Government are obtain'd they all equally follow the voice of Nature in constituting them  Again if man were by nature so tenacious of his Liberty without restraint he must be rationally so The creation of Absolute Monarchys which intirely extinguishes it must necessarily be most contrary to it tho the people were willing for they thereby abjure their own Nature The usurpation of them can be no less than the most abominable and outrageous violation of the Laws of Nature that can be imagin'd The Laws of God must be in the like measure broken and of all Governments Democracy in which every man's Liberty is least restrain'd because every man has an equal part would certainly prove to be the most just rational and natural whereas our Author represents it as a perpetual spring of disorder confusion and vice This consequence would be unavoidable if he said true but it being my fate often to differ from him I hope to be excus'd if I do so in this also and affirm that nothing but the plain and certain dictates of Reason can be generally applicable to all men as the Law of their Nature and they who according to the best of their understanding provide for the good of themselves and their Posterity do all equally observe it He that inquires more exactly into the matter may find that Reason enjoins every man not to arrogate to himself more than he allows to others nor to retain that Liberty which will prove hurtful to him or to expect that others will suffer themselves to be restrain'd whilst he to their prejudice remains in the exercise of that freedom which Nature allows He who would be exempted from this common Rule must shew for what reason he should be rais'd above his Brethren and if he dos it not he is an enemy to them This is not Popularity but Tyranny and Tyrants are said  exuisse hominem  to throw off the Nature of men because they do unjustly and unreasonably assume to themselves that which agrees not with the frailty of human Nature and set up an Interest in themselves contrary to that of their Equals which they ought to defend as their own Such as favour them are like to them and we know of no Tyranny that was not set up by the worst nor of any that have bin destroy'd unless by the best of men The several Tyrannys of  Syracuse  were introduc'd by  Agathocles Dionysius Hieronymus Hippocrates Epicides  and others by the help of lend dissolute mercenary Villains and overthrown by  Timoleon Dion Theodorus  and others whose Vertues will be remember'd in all ages These and others like to them never sought liberty without restraint but such as was restrain'd by Laws tending to the publick Good that all might concur in promoting it and the unruly desires of those who affected Power and Honours which they did not deserve might be represt  The like was seen in  Rome  When  Brutus Valerius  and other vertuous Citizens had thrown out the leud  Tarquins  they trusted to their own innocence and reputation and thinking them safe under the protection of the Law contented themselves with such Honors as their Countrymen thought they deserv'd This would not satisfy the dissolute crew that us'd to be  Sodales adolescentium Tarquiniorum assueti more Regio vivere eam tum aequato jure omnium licentiam quaerentes libertatem aliorum in suam vertisse servitutem conquerebantur Regem hominem esse a quo impetres ubi jus ubi injuria opus sit Esse gratiae locum esse bene  i  io ira  i ignoscere posse Leges rem surdam esse inexorabilem salubriorem inopi quam potenti nihil laxamenti nec veniae habere si modum excesseris periculosum esse in tot humanis erroribus sola innocentia vivere  T Liv l    companions to the  Tarquins  I cannot say that either of these sought a Liberty without restraint for the vertuous were willing to be restrain'd by the Law and the vicious to submit to the Will of a man to gain impunity in offending But if our Author says true the licentious fury of these leud young men who endeavour'd to subvert the Constitution of their Country to procure the impunity of their own Crimes would have bin more natural that is more reasonable than the ordinary proceedings of the most vertuous who desir'd that the Law might be the rule of their Actions which is most absurd  The like vicious Wretches have in all times endeavour'd to put the Power into the hands of one man who might protect 'em in their Villanys and advance 'em to exorbitant Riches or undeserv'd Honors whilst the best men trusting in their Innocence and desiring no other Riches or Preferments than what by their Equals they were thought to deserve were contented with a due Liberty under the protection of a just Law and I must transcribe the Historys of the World or at least so much of them as concerns the Tyrannys that have bin set up or cast down if I should here insert all the proofs that might be given of it But I shall come nearer to the point which is not to compare Democracy with Monarchy but a regular mix'd Government with such an Absolute Monarchy as leaves all to the will of that Man Woman or Child who happens to be born in the reigning Family how ill soever they may be qualify'd I desire those who are lovers of Truth to consider whether the wisest best and bravest of Men are not naturally led to be pleas'd with a Goverment that protects them from receiving wrong when they have not the least inclination to do any Whether they who desire no unjust advantage above their Brethren will not always desire that a People or Senat constituted as that of  Rome  from the expulsion of  Tarquin  to the setting up of  Cesar  should rather judg of their Merit than  Tarquin Cesar  or his Successors Or whether the leud or corrupted Pretorian Bands with  Macro Sejanus Tigellinus  and the like commanding them will not ever like  Brutus  his Sons abhor the inexorable Power of the Laws with the necessity of living only by their innocence and favour the Interest of Princes like to those that advanc'd them If this be not sufficient they may be pleas'd a little to reflect upon the Affairs of our own Country and seriously consider whether  Hde Clfd Flm th Arlngn  and  Dnby  could have pretended to the chief places if the  disposal of them had bin in a free and wellregulated Parliament Whether they did most resemble  Brutus Publicola  and the rest of the  Valerii  the  Fabii Quintii Cornelii  c or  Narcissus Pallas Icetus Laco Vinnius  and the like Whether all men good and bad do not favour that state of things which favours them and such as they are Whether  Clvld Prtsmth  and others of the same trade have attain'd to the Riches and Honors they enjoy by Services done to the Commonwealth And what places  Chiffinch Fx  and  Jenkins  could probably have attain'd if our Affairs had bin regulated as good men desire Whether the old Arts of begging stealing and bawding or the new ones of informing and trepanning thrive best under one man who may be weak or vicious and is always subject to be circumvented by Flatterers or under the severe scrutinys of a Senat or People In a word whether they who live by such Arts and know no other do not always endeavour to advance the Government under which they enjoy or may hope to obtain the highest Honors and abhor that in which they are expos'd to all manner of scorn and punishment Which being determin'd it will easily appear why the worst men have ever bin for Absolute Monarchy and the best against it and which of the two in so doing can be said to desire an unrestrain'd Liberty of doing that which is evil  SECT XXI Mix'd and Popular Governments preserve Peace and manage Wars better than Absolute Monarchys  BEing no way concern'd in the defence of Democracy and having prov'd that  Xenophon Thucydides  and others of the Antients in speaking against the overgreat Power of the common People intended to add Reputation to the Aristocratical Party to which they were addicted and not to set up Absolute Monarchy which never fell under discourse among them but as an object of scorn and hatred evil in it self and only to be endur'd by base and barbarous People I may leave our Knight like  Don Quixote  fighting against the Phantasms of his own brain and saying what he pleases against such Governments as never were unless in such a place as  San Marino  near  Sinigaglia  in  Italy  where a hundred Clowns govern a barbarous Rock that no man invades and relates nothing to our question If his Doctrin be true the Monarchy he extols is not only to be prefer'd before unruly Democracy and mix'd Governments but is the only one that without a gross violation of the Laws of God and Nature can be establish'd over any Nation But having as I hope sufficiently prov'd that God did neither institute nor appoint any such to be instituted nor approve those that were that Nature dos not incline us to it and that the best as well as the wisest men have always abhor'd it that it has bin agreeable only to the most stupid and base Nations and if others have submitted to it they have done so only as to the greatest of Evils brought upon them by Violence Corruption or Fraud I may now proceed to shew that the Progress of it has bin in all respects sutable to its beginning  To this end 'twill not be amiss to examin our Author's words  Thus  says he  do they paint to the life this Beast with many heads Let me give  the Cypher of their Form of Government as it is begot by Sedition so it is nourish'd by Crimes It can never stand without Wars either with an Enemy abroad or with Friends at home  And in order to this I will not criticize upon the terms tho the Cypher of a Form and War with Friends may be justly call'd Nonsense but coming to his Assertions that popular or mix'd Governments have their birth in Sedition and are ever afterterwards vex'd with Civil or Foreign Wars I take liberty to say That whereas there is no Form appointed by God or Nature those Governments only can be call'd Just which are establish'd by the consent of Nations These Nations may at the first set up popular or mix'd Governments and without the guilt of Sedition introduce them afterwards if that which was first establish'd prove unprofitable or hurtful to them and those that have done so have enjoy'd more Justice in times of Peace and managed Wars when occasion requir'd with more vertue and better success than any Absolute Monarchys have done And whereas he says that  in popular Governments each man has a care of his particular and thinks basely of the common Good They look upon approaching Mischiefs as they do upon Thunder only every man wishes it may not touch his own Person  I say that men can no otherwise be engag'd to take care of the Publick than by having such a part in it as Absolute Monarchy dos not allow for under it they can neither obtain the Good for themselves Posterity and Friends that they desire nor prevent the Mischiefs they fear which are the principal Arguments that persuade men to expose themselves to labours or dangers 'Tis a folly to say that the vigilance and wisdom of the Monarch supplies the defect of care in others for we know that no men under the Sun were ever more void of both and all manner of vertue requir'd to such a work than very many Monarchs have bin And which is yet worse the strength and happiness of the People being frequently dangerous to them they have not so much as the will to promote it nay sometimes set themselves to destroy it Antient Monarchys afford us frequent examples of this kind and if we consider those of  France  and  Turky  which seem most to flourish in our Age the People will appear to be so miserable under both that they cannot fear any change of Governor or Government and all except a few Ministers are kept so far from the knowledg of or power in the management of Affairs that if any of them should fancy a possibility of something that might befal them worse than what they suffer or hope for that which might alleviate their misery they could do nothing towards the advancement of the one or prevention of the other  Tacitus  observes that in his time no man was able to write what past  Inscitia Reipublicae ut alienae  They  Tacit An l  neglected the publick Affairs in which they had no part In the same Age it was said that the People who whilst they fought for their own Interests had bin invincible being enslav'd were grown sordid idle base running after Stageplays and Shows so as the whole strength of the  Roman  Armys consisted of Strangers When their Spirits were deprest by servitude they had neither courage to defend themselves nor will to fight for their wicked Masters and least of all to increase their Power which was destructive to themselves The same thing is found in all places Tho the  Turk  commands many vast Provinces that naturally produce as good Soldiers as any yet his greatest strength is in Children that do not know their Fathers who not being very many in number may perish in one Battel and the Empire by that means be lost the miserable Nations that groan under that Tyranny having neither courage  power nor will to defend it This was the fate of the  Mamalukes  They had for the space of almost two hundred years domineer'd in  Egypt  and a great part of  Asia  but the people under them being weak and disaffected they could never recover the Defeat they received from  Selim  near  Tripoli  who pursuing his Victory in a few months utterly abolish'd their Kingdom  Notwithstanding the present Pride of  France  the numbers and warlike Inclinations of that People the bravery of the Nobility extent of Dominion convenience of Situation and the vast Revenues of their King his greatest Advantages have bin gain'd by the mistaken Counsels of  England  the valor of our Soldiers unhappily sent to serve him and the Strangers of whom the strength of his Armys consists which is so unsteddy a support that many who are well vers'd in Affairs of this nature incline to think he subsists rather by little Arts and corrupting Ministers in Foreign Courts than by the Power of his own Armys and that some reformation in the Counsels of his Neighbours might prove sufficient to overthrow that Greatness which is grown formidable to  Europe  the same misery to which he has reduc'd his People rendring them as unable to defend him upon any change of Fortune as to defend their own Rights against him  This proceeds not from any particular defect in the  French  Government but that which is common to all Absolute Monarchys And no State can be said to stand upon a steddy Foundation except those whose strength is in their own Soldiery and the body of their own People Such as serve for Wages often betray their Masters in distress and always want the courage and industry which is found in those who fight for their own Interests and are to have a part in the Victory The business of Mercenarys is so to perform their duty as to keep their Employments and to draw profit from them but that is not enough to support the Spirits of men in extreme dangers The Shepherd who is a hireling flies when the Thief comes and this adventitious help failing all that a Prince can reasonably expect from a disaffected and opprest People is that they should bear the Yoke patiently in the time of his Prosperity but upon the change of his Fortune they leave him to shift for himself or join with his Enemys to avenge the Injurys they had receiv'd Thus did  Alphonso  and  Ferdinand  Kings of  Naples  and  Lodovico Sforza  Duke of  Milan  fall in the times of  Charles  the Eighth and  Louis  the Twelfth Kings of  France  The two first had bin false violent and cruel nothing within their Kingdom could oppose their fury but when they were invaded by a foreign Power they lost all as  Guicciardin  says without breaking one Lance and  Sforza  was by his own mercenary Soldiers deliver'd into the hands of his Enemys  I think it may be hard to find Examples of such as proceeding in the same way have had better Success But if it should so fall out that a People living under an Absolute Monarchy should thro custom or fear of something worse if that can be not only suffer patiently but desire to uphold the Government neither the Nobility nor Commonalty can do any thing towards it They are strangers to all publick Concernments All things are govern'd by one or a sew men and others know nothing either of Action or Counsel  Filmer  will tell us 'tis no matter the profound Wisdom of the Prince provides for all But what if this Prince be a Child a Fool a superannuated Dotard or a Madman Or if he dos not fall under any of these extremitys and possesses such a  proportion of Wit Industry and Courage as is ordinarily seen in men how shall he supply the Office that indeed requires profound Wisdom and an equal measure of Experience and Valor 'Tis to no purpose to say a good Council may supply his defects for it dos not appear how he should come by this Council nor who should oblige him to follow their advice If he be left to his own will to do what he pleases tho good advice be given to him yet his judgment being perverted he will always incline to the worst If a necessity be impos'd upon him of acting according to the advice of his Council he is not that absolute Monarch of whom we speak nor the Government Monarchical but Aristocratical These are imperfect Figleave coverings of Nakedness It was in vain to give good Counsel to  Sardanapalus  and none could defend the  Assyrian  Empire when he lay wallowing amongst his Whores without any other thought than of his Lusts None could preserve  Rome  when  Domitian  's chief business was to kill Flies and that of  Honorius  to take care of his Hens The Monarchy of  France  must have perish'd under the base Kings they call  Les Roys faineants  if the Scepter had not bin wrested out of their unworthy hands The World is full of Examples in this kind and when it pleases God to bestow a just wise and valiant King as a blessing upon a Nation 'tis only a momentary help his Vertues end with him and there being neither any divine Promise nor human Reason moving us to believe that they shall always be renew'd and continu'd in his Successors men cannot rely upon it and to alledg a possibility of such a thing is nothing to the purpose  On the other side in a popular or mix'd Government every man is concern'd Every one has a part according to his quality or merit all changes are prejudicial to all Whatsoever any man conceives to be for the publick good he may propose it in the Magistracy or to the Magistrate The body of the People is the publick defence and every man is arm'd and disciplin'd the advantages of good success are communicated to all and every one bears a part in the losses This makes men generous and industrious and fills their hearts with Love to their Country  Amor patriae laudisque immensa cupido  Virg  This and the desire of that praise which is the Reward of Vertue rais'd the  Romans  above the rest of Mankind and wheresoever the same ways are taken they will in a great measure have the same effects By this means they had as many Soldiers to fight for their Country as there were Freemen in it Whilst they had to deal with the free Nations of  Italy Greece Africa  or  Spain  they never conquer'd a Country till the Inhabitants were exhausted But when they came to fight against Kings the success of a Battel was enough to bring a Kingdom under their power  Antiochus  upon a ruffle receiv'd from  Acilius  at  Thermopylae  left all that he possest in  Greece  and being defeated by  Scipio Nasica  he quitted all the Kingdoms and Territorys of  Asia  on this side  Taurus Paulus Emilius  became Master of  Macedon  by one prosperous fight against  Perses Syphax Gentius Tigranes Ptolomy  and others were more easily subdu'd The mercenary Armys on which they rely'd being broken the Citys and Countrys not caring for their Masters submitted to those who had more vertue and better fortune If the  Roman  Power had not bin built upon a more sure foundation they could not have subsisted Notwithstanding their Valor they were often beaten but their losses were immediately  repair'd by the excellence of their Disciplin When  Hannibal  had gain'd the Battels of  Trebia Ticinum Thrasimene  and  Cannae  defeated the  Romans  in many other Encounters and slain above two hundred thousand of their Men with  Paulus Emilius C Servilius Sempronius Gracchus Quintius Marcellus  and many other excellent Commanders When about the same time the two brave  Scipio  's had bin cut off with their Armys in  Spain  and many great Losses had bin sustain'd in  Sicily  and by Sea one would have thought it impossible for the City to have resisted But their Vertue love to their Country and good Government was a strength that increas'd under all their Calamitys and in the end overcame all The nearer  Hannibal  came to the Walls the more obstinate was their resistance Tho he had kill'd more great Captains than any Kingdom ever had others daily step'd up in their place who excel'd them in all manner of Vertue I know not if at any time that conquering City could glory in a greater number of men fit for the highest Enterprises than at the end of that cruel War which had consum'd so many of them but I think that the finishing Victorys by them obtain'd are but ill proofs of our Author's assertion that they  thought basely of the common Good and sought only to save themselves  We know of none except  Cecilius Metellus  who after the Battel of  Cannae  had so base a thought as to design the withdrawing himself from the publick ruin but  Scipio  afterwards sirnam'd  Africanus  threatning death to those who would not swear never to abandon their Country forc'd him to leave it This may in general be imputed to good Government and Disciplin with which all were so season'd from their infancy that no affection was so rooted in them as an ardent love to their Country and a resolution to die for it or with it but the means by which they accomplish'd their great Ends so as after their defeats to have such men as carry'd on their noblest Designs with more glory than ever was their annual Elections of Magistrats many being thereby advanc'd to the supreme Commands and every one by the Honors he enjoy'd fill'd with a desire of rendring himself worthy of them  I should not much insist upon these things if they had bin seen only in  Rome  but tho their Disciplin seems to have bin more perfect better observ'd and to have produc'd a Vertue that surpast all others the like has bin found tho perhaps not in the same degree in all Nations that have enjoy'd their Liberty and were admitted to such a part of the Government as might give them a love to it This was evident in all the Nations of  Italy  The  Sabins Volsci Aequi Tuscans Samnites  and others were never conquer'd till they had no men left The  Samnites  alone inhabiting a small and barren Province suffer'd more defeats before they were subdu'd than all the Kingdoms of  Numidia Aegypt Macedon  and  Asia  and as 'tis exprest in their Embassy to  Hannibal  never yielded till they who had brought vast numbers of men into the Field and by them defeated some of the  Roman  Armys were reduc'd to such weakness that they could not resist one Legion We hear of sew  Spartans  who did not willingly expose their Lives for the service of their Country and the Women themselves were so far inflam'd with the same affection that they refus'd to mourn for their Children and Husbands who dy'd in the defence of it When the brave  Brasidas  was slain some eminent men went to comfort his Mother upon the news of his death and telling her he was the most valiant man in the City she  Thucyd de Bell Pelopon  answer'd that he was indeed a valiant man and dy'd as he ought to do  but that thro the goodness of the Gods many others were left as valiant as he  When  Xerxes  invaded  Greece  there was not a Citizen of  Athens  able to bear Arms who did not leave his Wife and Children to shift for themselves in the neighbouring Citys and their Houses to be burnt when they imbark'd with  Themistocles  and never thought of either till they had defeated the  Barbarians  at  Salamis  by Sea and at  Platea  by Land When men are thus spirited some will ever prove excellent and as none did ever surpass those who are bred under this disciplin in all moral military and civil Vertues those very Countrys where they flourish'd most have not produc'd any eminent men since they lost that Liberty which was the Mother and Nurse of them  Tho I should fill a Volume with examples of this kind as I might easily do such as our Author will say that in Popular Governments men look upon Mischiefs as Thunder and only wish it may not touch themselves But leaving them to the scorn and hatred they deserve by their impudence and folly I conclude this point with the answer that  Trajano  Ragion  Boccalini  puts into the mouth of  Apollo  to the Princes who complain'd that their Subjects had not that love to their Countrys as had bin and was daily seen in those who liv'd under Commonwealths which amounted to no more than to tell them that their ill Government was the cause of that defect and that the prejudices incur'd by Rapine Violence and Fraud were to be repair'd only by Liberality Justice and such a care of their Subjects that they might live happily under them  SECT XXII Commonwealths seek Peace or War according to the Variety of their Constitutions  IF I have hitherto spoken in general of popular or mix'd Governments as if they were all founded on the same principle it was only because our Author without distinction has generally blam'd them all and generally imputed to every one those Faults which perhaps never were many but most certainly are directly opposite to the temper and constitution of many among them Malice and Ignorance reign so equally in him that 'tis not easy to determin from which of the two this false representation proceeds But lest any man should thereby be impos'd upon 'tis time to observe That the Constitutions of Commonwealths have bin so various according to the different temper of Nations and Times that if some of them seem to have bin principally constituted for War others have as much delighted in Peace and many having taken the middle and as some think the best way have so moderated their love to Peace as not to suffer the Spirits of the People to fall but kept them in a perpetual readiness to make War when there was occasion and every one of those having follow'd several ways and ends deserve our particular consideration  The Citys of  Rome Sparta Thebes  and all the Associations of the  Etolians Achaians Sabins Latins Samnites  and many others that antiently flourish'd in  Greece  and  Italy  seem to have intended nothing but the just preservation of Liberty at home and making War abroad All the Nations  of  Spain Germany  and  Gaul  sought the same things Their principal work was to render their People valiant obedient to their Commanders lovers of their Country and always ready to fight for it And for this reason when the Senators of  Rome  had kill'd  Romulus  they persuaded  Julius Proculus  to affirm that he had seen him in a most glorious form ascending to Heaven and promising great things to the City  Proinde rem militarem colant  The  Athenians  were not less inclin'd to War but apply'd themselves to Trade as subservient to that end by increasing the number of the People and furnishing them with the means of carrying it on with more vigor and power The  Phenician  Citys of which  Carthage  was the most eminent follow'd the same method but knowing that Riches do not defend themselves or scorning slothfully to enjoy what was gain'd by Commerce they so far apply'd themselves to War that they grew to a Power which  Rome  only was able to overthrow  Venice Florence Genoa Lucca  and some other Citys of  Italy  seem chiefly to have aim'd at Trade and placing the hopes of their safety in the protection of more powerful States have unwillingly enter'd into Wars especially by Land and when they did they made them by mercenary Soldiers  Again some of those that intended War desir'd to enlarge their Territorys by conquest others only to preserve their own and to live with freedom and safety upon them  Rome  was of the first sort and knowing that such ends cannot be accomplish'd without great numbers of men they freely admitted Strangers into the City Senat and Magistracy  Numa  was a  Sabin Tarquinius Priscus  was the Son of a  Grecian  One hundred of those  Sabins  who came with  Tatius  were admitted into the Senat  Appius Claudius  of the same People came to  Rome  was made a Member of the Senat and created Consul They demolish'd several Citys and brought the Inhabitants to their own gave the right of Citizens to many others sometimes to whole Citys and Provinces and car'd not how many they receiv'd so they could engraft them upon the same interest with the old stock and season them with the same Principles Disciplin and Manners On the other side the  Spartans  desiring only to continue free vertuous and safe in the enjoyment of their own Territory and thinking themselves strong enough to defend it fram'd a most severe Disciplin to which few Strangers would submit They banish'd all those curious Arts that are useful to Trade prohibited the importation of Gold and Silver appointed the  Helotes  to cultivate their Lands and to exercise such Trades as are necessary to life admitted few Strangers to live amongst them made none of them free of their City and educated their Youth in such exercises only as prepar'd them for War I will not take upon me to judg whether this proceeded from such a moderation of Spirit as plac'd Felicity rather in the fulness and stability of Liberty Integrity Vertue and the enjoyment of their own than in Riches Power and Dominion over others nor which of these two different methods deserves most to be commended But certain it is that both succeeded according to the intention of the Founders  Rome  conquer'd the best part of the World and never wanted men to defend what was gain'd  Sparta  liv'd in such happiness and reputation that till it was invaded by  Epimanondas  an Enemys Trumpet had not bin heard by those within the Town for the space of eight hundred years and never suffer'd any great disaster till receding from their own Institutions they were brought by prosperity to affect the principality of  Greece  and to undertake such Wars as could not be carry'd on without Mony and greater numbers of men than a small City was able to furnish by which means they were oblig'd to beg assistance from the Barbarians whom they scorn'd and hated as appears by the Storys of  Callicratidas Lysander  and  Agesilaus  and fell into such straits as were never recover'd  The like variety has bin observ'd in the Constitutions of those Northern Nations that invaded the Roman Empire for tho all of them intended War and look'd upon those only to be Members of their Commonwealths who us'd arms to defend them yet some did immediately incorporate themselves with those of the conquer'd Countrys Of this number were the  Franks  who presently became one Nation with the  Gauls  others kept themselves in a distinct Body as the  Saxons  did from the  Britains  And the  Goths  for more than three hundred years that they reign'd in  Spain  never contracted Marriages or otherwise mix'd with the  Spaniards  till their Kingdom was overthrown by the  Moors  These things and others of the like nature being weigh'd many have doubted whether it were better to constitute a Commonwealth for War or for Trade and of such as intend War whether those are most to be prais'd who prepare for defence only or those who design by conquest to enlarge their Dominions Or if they admit of Trade whether they should propose the acquisition of Riches for their ultimate end and depend upon foreign or mercenary Forces to defend them or to be as helps to enable their own People to carry on those Wars in which they may be frequently engag'd These Questions might perhaps be easily decided if Mankind were of a temper to suffer those to live in peace who offer no injury to any or that men who have Mony to hire Soldiers when they stand in need of them could find such as would valiantly and faithfully defend them whilst they apply themselves to their Trades But experience teaching us that those only can be safe who are strong and that no People was ever well defended but those who fought for themselves the best Judges of these matters have always given the preference to those Constitutions that principally intend War and make use of Trade as assisting to that end and think it better to aim at conquest rather than simply to stand upon their own defence since he that loses all if he be overcome sights upon very unequal terms and if he obtain the Victory gains no other advantage than for the present to repel the danger that threaten'd him  These Opinions are confirm'd by the examples of the  Romans  who prosper'd much more than the  Spartans  And the  Carthaginians  who made use of Trade as a help to War rais'd their City to be one of the most potent that ever was in the World Whereas the  Venetians  having rely'd on Trade and mercenary Soldiers are always forc'd too much to depend upon foreign Potentats very often to buy Peace with ignominious and prejudicial conditions and sometimes to fear the infidelity of their own Commanders no less than the violence of their Enemys But that which ought to be valu'd above all in point of Wisdom as well as Justice is the Government given by God to the  Hebrews  which chiefly fitted them for War and to make Conquests  Moses  divided them under several Captains into thousands hundreds fiftys and tens This was a perpetual Ordinance amongst them In numbring them those only were counted who were able to bear arms Every man was oblig'd to go out to War except such as had marry'd a Wife or upon other  special occasions were for a time excus'd and the whole series of the sacred History shews that there were always as many Soldiers to fight for their Country as there were men able to fight And if this be taken for a Picture of a manyheaded Beast delighting in Blood begotten by Sedition and nourish'd by Crimes God himself was the drawer of it  In this variety of Constitutions and Effects proceeding from them I can see nothing more justly and generally to be attributed to them all than that Love to their Country which our Author impudently affirms to be wanting in all In other matters their proceedings are not only different but contrary to each other yet it cannot be said that any Nations have injoy'd so much Peace as some Republicks The  Venetians  too great inclination to Peace is accounted to be a mortal error in their Constitution and they have not bin less free from domestick Seditions than foreign Wars the Conspiracys of the  Falerii  and  Tiepoli  were extinguish'd by their punishment and that of  La Cueva  crush'd before it was ripe  Genoa  has not bin altogether so happy the factions of the  Guelphs  and  Ghibelins  that spread themselves over all  Italy  infected that City and the malice of the  Spaniards  and  French  rais'd others under the  Fregosi  and  Adorni  but they being compos'd they have for more than a hundred and fifty years rested in quiet  There is another sort of Commonwealth compos'd of many Citys associated together and living  aequo jure  every one retaining and exercising a Sovereign Power within it self except in some cases exprest in the Act of Union or League made between them These I confess are more hardly preserv'd in Peace Disputes may arise among them concerning Limits Jurisdiction and the like They cannot always be equally concern'd in the same things The injurys offer'd to one do not equally affect all Their Neighbors will sow Divisions among them and not having a MotherCity to decide their Controversys by her authority they may be apt to fall into quarrels especially if they profess Christianity which having bin split into variety of opinions ever since it was preach'd and the Papists by their cruelty to such as dissent from them shewing to all that there is no other way of defending themselves against them than by using the same almost every man is come to think he ought as far as in him lies to impose his belief on others and that he can give no better testimony of his Zeal than the excess of his violence on that account Nevertheless the Cantons of the  Switzers  tho accompany'd with all the most dangerous circumstances that can be imagin'd being thirteen in number independent on each other govern'd in a high degree popularly professing Christianity differing in most important points eight of them much influenc'd by the Jesuits and perpetually excited to War against their Brethren by the powerful Crowns of  Spain  and  France  have ever since they cast off the insupportable Yoke of the Earls of  Hapsburg  enjoy'd more peace than any other State of  Europe  and from the most inconsiderable people are grown to such a Power that the greatest Monarchs do most sollicitously seek their Friendship and none have dar'd to invade them since  Charles  Duke of  Burgundy  did it to his ruin and he who for a long time had bin a terror to the great dangerous and subtil King of  France  gave by the loss of three Armys and his own life a lasting testimony of his temerity in assaulting a free and valiant tho a poor people fighting in their own quarrel  Commines  well relates that War but a vast heap of Bones remaining to this day at  Muret  with this inscription  Caroli fortissimi Burgundiorum Ducis exercitus Muretum obsidens  ab Helvetiis caesus hoc sui Monumentum reliquit  best shews the success of it Since that time their greatest Wars have bin for the defence of  Milan  or such as they have undertaken for pay under the Ensigns of  France  or  Spain  that by the use of Arms they may keep up that Courage Reputation and Experience which is requir'd for the defence of their own Country No Government was ever more free from popular Seditions the revolts of their Subjects have bin few weak and easily supprest the dissension rais'd by the Jesuits between the Cantons of  Zurich  and  Lucern  was as soon compos'd as the rebellion of the County of  Vaux  against the Canton of  Bern  and those few of the like nature that have happen'd among them have had the like success So that  Thuanus  in the History of his time comprehending about fifty years and relating the horrid domestick and foreign Wars that distracted  Germany France Spain Italy Flanders England Scotland Poland Denmark Sweden Hungary Transilvania Muscovy Turky Africk  and other places has no more to say of them than to shew what Arts had bin in vain us'd to disturb their so much envy'd quiet But if the modest temper of the People together with the Wisdom Justice and Strength of their Government could not be discompos'd by the measures of  Spain  and  France  by the industry of their Embassadors or the malicious craft of the Jesuits we may safely conclude that their State is as well settled as any thing among men can be and can hardly comprehend what is like to interrupt it As much might be said of the Citys of the  Hanseatick  Society if they had an intire Sovereignty in themselves But the Citys of the United Provinces in the Low Countrys being every one of them Sovereign within themselves and many in number still continuing in their Union in spite of all the endeavours that have bin us'd to divide them give us an example of such steddiness in practice and principle as is hardly to be parallel'd in the world and that undeniably prove a temper in their Constitutions directly opposite to that which our Author imputes to all popular Governments and if the Death of  Barnevelt  and  De Wit  or the preserment of some most unlike to them be taken for a testimony that the best men thrive worst and the worst best I hope it may be consider'd that those Violences proceeded from that which is most contrary to Popularity tho I am not very willing to explain it  If these matters are not clear in themselves I desire they may be compar'd with what has happen'd between any Princes that from the beginning of the world have bin join'd in League to each other whether they were of the same or of different Nations Let an example be brought of six thirteen or more Princes or Kings who enter'd into a League and for the space of one or more Ages did neither break it nor quarrel upon the explication of it Let the States of the  Switzers Grisons  or  Hollanders  be compar'd with that of  France  when it was sometimes divided between two three or four Brothers of  Meroveus  or  Pepin  's Races with the Heptarchy of  England  the Kingdoms of  Leon Arragon Navarr Castile  and  Portugal  under which the Christians in  Spain  were divided or those of  Cordoua Sevil Malaga Granada  and others under the Power of the  Moors  and if it be not evident that the popular States have bin remarkable for Peace among themselves constancy to their Union and Fidelity to the Leagues made with their Associats whereas all the abovemention'd Kingdoms and such others as are known among men to have bin join'd in the like Leagues were ever infested with domestick Rebellions and Quarrels arising from the Ambition of Princes  so as no Confederacy could be so cautiously made but they would find ways to elude it or so solemn and sacred but they would in far less time break thro it I will confess that Kingdoms have sometimes bin as free from civil disturbances and that Leagues made between several Princes have bin as constantly and religiously observ'd as by Commonwealths But if no such thing dos appear in the World and no man who is not impudent or ignorant dare pretend it I may justly conclude that tho every Commonwealth has its Action sutable to its Constitution and that many associated together are not so free from disturbances as those that wholly depend upon the Authority of a Mother City yet we know of none that have not bin and are more regular and quiet than any Principalitys and as to Foreign Wars they seek or avoid them according to their various Constitutions  SECT XXIII That is the best Government which best provides for War  OUR Author having huddled up all popular and mix'd Governments into one has in some measure forc'd me to explain the various Constitutions and Principles upon which they are grounded But as the wisdom of a Father is seen not only in providing Bread for his Family or increasing his Patrimonial Estate but in making all possible provision for the security of it so that Government is evidently the best which not relying upon what it dos at first enjoy seeks to increase the number strength and riches of the People and by the best Disciplin to bring the Power so improv'd into such order as may be of most use to the Publick This comprehends all things conducing to the administration of Justice the preservation of domestick Peace and the increase of Commerce that the People being pleas'd with their present condition may be fill'd with love to their Country encourag'd to fight boldly for the publick Cause which is their own and as men do willingly join with that which prospers that Strangers may be invited to fix their Habitations in such a City and to espouse the principles that reign in it This is necessary for several reasons but I shall principally insist upon one which is that all things in their beginning are weak The Whelp of a Lion newly born has neither strength nor fierceness He that builds a City and dos not intend it should increase commits as great an absurdity as if he should desire his Child might ever continue under the same weakness in which he is born If it dos not grow it must pine and perish for in this World nothing is permanent that which dos not grow better will grow worse This increase also is useless or perhaps hurtful if it be not in Strength as well as in Riches or Number for every one is apt to seize upon illguarded Treasures and the terror that the City of  London  was possest with when a few Dutch Ships came to  Chatham  shews that no numbers of men tho naturally valiant are able to defend themselves unless they be well arm'd disciplin'd and conducted Their Multitude brings confusion their Wealth when 'tis like to be made a prey increases the fears of the owners and they who if they were brought into good order might conquer a great part of the World being destitute of it durst not think of defending themselves  If it be said that the wise Father mention'd by me endeavours to secure his Patrimony by Law not by Force I answer that all defence terminates in force and if a private man dos not prepare to defend his Estate with his own Force 'tis because he lives under the protection of the Law and expects the force of the Magistrate should be a security to him but Kingdoms and Commonwealths acknowledging no Superior except God alone can reasonably hope to be protected by him only and by him if with industry and courage they make use of the means he has given them for their own defence God helps those who help themselves and men are by several reasons suppose to prevent the increase of a suspected Power induc'd to succour an industrious and brave People But such as neglect the means of their own preservation are ever left to perish with shame Men cannot rely upon any League The State that is defended by one Potentat against another becomes a Slave to their Protector Mercenary Soldiers always want Fidelity or Courage and most commonly both If they are not corrupted or beaten by the Invader they make a prey of their Masters These are the followers of Camps who have neither Faith nor Piety  Ibi fas ubi maxima merces  Lucan  but prefer Gain before Right They who expose their Blood to sale look where they can make the best bargain and never fail of pretences for following their interests  Moreover private Familys may by several arts increase their Wealth as they increase in number but when a People multiplies as they will always do in a good Climat under a good Government such an enlargement of Territory as is necessary for their subsistence can be acquir'd only by War This was known to the Northern Nations that invaded the  Roman  Empire but for want of such Constitutions as might best improve their Strength and Valor the numbers they sent out when they were overburden'd provided well for themselves but were of no use to the Countrys they left and whilst those  Goths Vandals Franks  and  Normans  enjoy'd the most opulent and delicious Provinces of the World their Fathers languish'd obscurely in their frozen Climats For the like reasons or thro the same defect the  Switzers  are oblig'd to serve other Princes and often to imploy that valor in advancing the power of their Neighbors which might be us'd to increase their own  Genoua Lucca Geneva  and other small Commonwealths having no Wars are not able to nourish the men they breed but sending many of their Children to seek their Fortunes abroad scarce a third part of those that are born among them die in those Citys and if they did not take this course they would have no better than the Nations inhabiting near the River  Niger  who sell their Children as the increase of their Flocks  This dos not less concern Monarchys than Commonwealths nor the absolute less than the mix'd All of them have bin prosperous or miserable glorious or contemptible as they were better or worse arm'd disciplin'd or conducted The  Assyrian  Valor was irresistible under  Nabuchodonozor  but was brought to nothing under his base and luxurious Grandson  Belshazzar  The  Persians  who under  Cyrus  conquer'd  Asia  were like Swine expos'd to slaughter when their Disciplin fail'd and they were commanded by his proud cruel and cowardly Successors The  Macedonian  Army overthrown by  Paulus Emilius  was not less in number than that with which  Alexander  gain'd the Empire of the East and perhaps had not bin inferior in Valor if it had bin as well commanded Many poor and almost unknown Nations have bin carry'd to such a height of  Glory by the Bravery of their Princes that I might incline to think their Government as fit as any other for disciplining a People to War if their Vertues continu'd in their Familys or could be transmitted to their Successors The impossibility of this is a breach never to be repair'd and no account is to be made of the good that is always uncertain and seldom enjoy'd This disease is not only in absolute Monarchys but in those also where any regard is had to Succession of Blood tho under the strictest limitations The Fruit of all the Victorys gain'd by  Edward  the First and Third or  Henry  the Fifth of  England  perish'd by the baseness of their Successors the glory of our Arms was turn'd into shame and we by the loss of Treasure Blood and Territory suffer'd the punishment of their Vices The effects of these changes are not always equally violent but they are frequent and must fall out as often as occasion is presented It was not possible for  Lewis  the Thirteenth of  France  to pursue the great designs of  Henry  the Fourth  Christina  of  Sweden  could not supply the place of her brave Father nor the present King in his Infancy accomplish what the great  Charles Gustavus  had nobly undertaken and no remedy can be found for this mortal infirmity unless the power be put into the hands of those who are able to execute it and not left to the blindness of fortune When the Regal Power is committed to an annual or otherwise chosen Magistracy the Vertues of excellent men are of use but all dos not depend upon their persons One man finishes what another had begun and when many are by practice render'd able to perform the same things the loss of one is easily supply'd by the election of another When good Principles are planted they do not die with the person that introduc'd 'em and good Constitutions remain tho the Authors of 'em perish  Rome  did not fall back into slavery when  Brutus  was kill'd who had led them to recover their Liberty Others like to him pursu'd the same ends and notwithstanding the loss of so many great Commanders consum'd in their almost continual Wars they never wanted such as were fit to execute whatever they could design A wellgovern'd State is as fruitful to all good purposes as the sevenheaded Serpent is said to have bin in evil when one head is cut off many rise up in the place of it Good Order being once establish'd makes good men and as long as it lasts such as are fit for the greatest imployments will never be wanting By this means the  Romans  could not be surpris'd No King or Captain ever invaded them who did not find many excellent Commanders to oppose him whereas they themselves found it easy to overthrow Kingdoms tho they had bin establish'd by the bravest Princes thro the baseness of their Successors  But if our Author says true 'tis of no advantage to a popular State to have excellent men and therefore he imposes  a necessity upon every People to chuse the worst men for being the worst and most like to themselves lest that if vertuous and good men should come into power they should be excluded for being vicious and wicked  c  Wise men would seize upon the State and take it from the People  For the understanding of these words 'tis good to consider whether they are to be taken simply as usually apply'd to the Devil and some of his instruments or relatively as to the thing in question If simply it must be concluded that  Valerius Brutus Cincinnatus Capitolinus Mamercus Paulus Emilius Nasica  and others like to 'em were not only the worst men of the City but that they were so often advanc'd to the supreme Magistracy because they were so if in the other sense relating to Magistracy and the command of  Armys the worst are the most ignorant unfaithful slothful or cowardly and our Author to make good his proposition must prove that when the People of  Rome Carthage Athens  and other States had the power of chusing whom they pleas'd they chose  Camillus Corvinus Torquatus Fabius Rullus Scipio Amilcar Hannibal Asdrubal Pelopidas Epaminondas Pericles Aristides Themistocles Phocion Alcibiades  and others like to them for their Ignorance Infidelity Sloth and Cowardice and on account of those Vices most like to those who chose them But if these were the worst I desire to know what wit or eloquence can describe or comprehend the excellency of the best or of the Disciplin that brings whole Nations to such perfection that worse than these could not be found among them And if they were not so but such as all succeeding Ages have justly admir'd for their Wisdom Vertue Industry and Valor the impudence of so wicked and false an Assertion ought to be rejected with scorn and hatred  But if all Governments whether Monarchial or Popular absolute or limited deserve praise or blame as they are well or ill constituted for making War and that the attainment of this end dos intirely depend upon the qualifications of the Commanders and the Strength Courage Number Affection and temper of the People out of which the Armys are drawn those Governments must necessarily be the best which take the best care that those Armys may be well commanded and so provide for the good of the People that they may daily increase in Number Courage and Strength and be so satisfy'd with the present state of things as to fear a change and fight for the preservation or advancement of the publick Interest as of their own We have already found that in Hereditary Monarchys no care at all is taken of the Commander He is not chosen but comes by chance and dos not only frequently prove defective but for the most part utterly uncapable of performing any part of his duty whereas in Popular Governments excellent men are generally chosen and there are so many of them that if one or more perish others are ready to supply their places And this Discourse having if I mistake not in the whole series shewn that the advantages of popular Governments in relation to the increase of Courage Number and Strength in a People out of which Armys are to be form'd and bringing them to such a temper as prepares 'em bravely to perform their duty are as much above those of Monarchys as the prudence of Choice surpasses the accidents of Birth it cannot be deny'd that in both respects the part which relates to War is much better perform'd in Popular Governments than in Monarchys  That which we are by reason led to believe is confirm'd to us by experience We every where see the difference between the Courage of men fighting for themselves and their posterity and those that serve a Master who by good success is often render'd insupportable This is of such efficacy that no King could ever boast to have overthrown any considerable Commonwealth unless it were divided within it self or weaken'd by Wars made with such as were also free which was the case of the  Grecian  Commonwealths when the  Macedonians  fell in upon them Whereas the greatest Kingdoms have bin easily destroy'd by Commonwealths and these also have lost all Strength Valor and Spirit after the change of their Government The Power and Vertue of the  Italians  grew up decay'd and perish'd with their Liberty When they were divided into many Commonwealths every one of them was able to send out great  Armys and to suffer many Defeats before they were subdu'd so that their Citys were deliver'd up by the old Men Women and Children when all those who were able to bear arms had bin slain And when they were all brought under the  Romans  either as Associats or Subjects they made the greatest Strength that ever was in the World  Alexander  of  Epirus  was in Valor thought equal and in Power little inferior to  Alexander  of  Macedon  but having the fortune to attack those who had bin brought up in Liberty taught to hazard or suffer all things for it and to think that God has given to men Hands and Swords only to defend it he perish'd in his attempt whilst the other encountring slavish Nations under the conduct of proud cruel and for the most part unwarlike Tyrants became Master of  Asia  Pyrrhus  seems to have bin equal to either of them but the Victorys he obtain'd by an admirable Valor and Conduct cost him so dear that he desir'd Peace with those Enemys who might be defeated not subdu'd  Hannibal  wanting the prudence of  Pyrrhus  lost the fruits of all his Victorys and being torn out of  Italy  where he had nested himself fell under the Sword of those whose Fathers he had defeated or slain and dy'd a banish'd man from his ruin'd Country  The  Gauls  did once bring  Rome  when it was small to the brink of Destruction but they left their Carcases to pay for the mischiefs they had done and in succeeding times their Invasions were mention'd as Tumults rather than Wars  The  Germans  did perhaps surpass them in numbers and strength and were equal to them in fortune as long as  Rome  was free They often enter'd  Italy  but they continu'd not long there unless under the weight of their Chains Whereas the same Nations and others like to them assaulting that Country or other Provinces under the Emperors found no other difficulty than what arose upon contests among themselves who should be Master of them No manly Vertue or Disciplin remain'd among the  Italians  Those who govern'd them rely'd upon tricks and shifts they who could not defend themselves hir'd some of those Nations to undertake their Quarrels against others These trinklings could not last The  Goths  scorning to depend upon those who in Valor and Strength were much inferior to themselves seiz'd upon the City that had commanded the World whilst  Honorius  was so busy in providing for his Hens that he could not think of defending it  Arcadius  had the luck not to lose his principal City but passing his time among Fidlers Players Eunuchs Cooks Dancers and Buffoons the Provinces were securely plunder'd and ransack'd by Nations that are known only from their Victorys against him  'Tis in vain to say that this proceeded from the fatal corruption of that Age for that corruption proceeded from the Government and the ensuing desolation was the effect of it And as the like disorder in Government has bin ever since in  Greece  and the greatest part of  Italy  those Countrys which for Extent Riches convenience of Situation and numbers of men are equal to the best in the world and for the Wit Courage and Industry of the Natives perhaps justly preferable to any have since that time bin always expos'd as a prey to the first Invader  Charles  the Eighth of  France  is by  Guicciardin  and other Writers represented as a Prince equally weak in Body Mind Mony and Forces but as an ill Hare is said to make a good Dog he conquer'd the best part of  Italy  without breaking  a Lance  Ferdinand  and  Alphonso  of  Arragon  Kings of  Naples  had govern'd by Trepanners false Witnesses corrupt Judges mercenary Soldiers and other Ministers of Iniquity but these could afford no help against an Invader and neither the opprest Nobility nor People concerning themselves in the quarrel they who had bin proud fierce and cruel against their poor Subjects never durst look an Enemy in the face and the Father dying with anguish and fear the Son shamefully fled from his illgovern'd Kingdom  The same things are no less evident in  Spain  No People ever defended themselves with more Obstinacy and Valor than the  Spaniards  did against the  Carthaginians  and  Romans  who surpast them in Wealth and Skill  Livy  calls them  Gentem ad bella gerenda reparanda natam  and who generally kill'd themselves when they were master'd and disarm'd  Nullam sine armis vitam esse rati  But tho the mixture of  Roman  Blood could not impair their Race and the conjunction of the  Goths  had improv'd their Force yet no more was requir'd for the overthrow of them all than the weakness and baseness of the two leud Tyrants  Witza  and  Rodrigo  who disdain'd all Laws and resolv'd to govern according to their Lust They who for more than two hundred years had resisted the  Romans  were intirely subdu'd by the vile halfnaked  Moors  in one slight Skirmish and do not to this day know what became of the King who brought the Destruction upon them That Kingdom after many Revolutions is with many others come to the House of  Austria  and enjoys all the Wealth of the  Indys  whereupon they are thought to have affected an universal Monarchy  Sed ut sunt levia Aulicorum ingenia  this was grounded upon nothing except their own Vanity They had Mony and Craft but wanting that solid Vertue and Strength which makes and preserves Conquests their Kings have nothing but  Milan  that did not come to them by Marriage And tho they have not receiv'd any extraordinary disasters in War yet they languish and consume thro the defects of their own Government and are forc'd to beg assistance from their mortal and formerly despis'd Enemys These are the best hopes of defence that they have from abroad and the only Enemy an Invader ought to fear in their desolate Territorys is that Want and Famin which testifys the good Order Strength and Stability of our Author's divine Monarchy the profound Wisdom of their Kings in subtilly finding out so sure a way of defending the Country their paternal care in providing for the good of their Subjects and that whatsoever is defective in the Prince is assuredly supply'd by the Sedulity of a good Council  We have already said enough to obviate the objections that may be drawn from the prosperity of the  French  Monarchy The beauty of it is false and painted There is a rich and haughty King who is blest with such Neighbours as are not likely to disturb him and has nothing to fear from his miserable Subjects but the whole body of that State is full of boils and wounds and putrid sores There is no real strength in it The People are so unwilling to serve him that he is said to have put to death above four score thousand of his own Soldiers within the space of fifteen years for flying from their Colours and if he were vigorously attack'd little help could be expected from a discontented Nobility or a starving and despairing People If to diminish the force of these arguments and examples it be said that in two or three thousand years all things are chang'd the antient Vertue of Mankind is extinguish'd and the love that every one had to his Country is turn'd into a care of his private Interests  I answer that Time changes nothing and the Changes produc'd in this time proceed only from the change of Governments The Nations which have bin govern'd arbitrarily have always suffer'd the same Plagues and bin infected with the same Vices which is as natural as for Animals ever to generate according to their kinds and Fruits to be of the same nature with the Roots and Seeds from which they come The same Order that made men valiant and industrious in the service of their Country during the first Ages would have the same effect if it were now in being Men would have the same love to the Publick as the  Spartans  and  Romans  had if there was the same reason for it We need no other proof of this than what we have seen in our own Country where in a few years good Disciplin and a just Encouragement given to those who did well produc'd more examples of pure compleat incorruptible and invincible Vertue than  Rome  or  Greece  could ever boast or if more be wanting they may easily be found among the  Switzers Hollanders  and others but 'tis not necessary to light a Candle to the Sun  SECT XXIV Popular Governments are less subject to Civil Disorders than Monarchys manage them more ably and more easily recover out of them  'TIS in vain to seek a Government in all points free from a possibility of Civil Wars Tumults and Seditions that is a Blessing deny'd to this life and reserv'd to compleat the Felicity of the next But if these are to be accounted the greatest evils that can fall upon a People the rectitude or defects of Governments will best appear if we examin which  Species  is more or less expos'd to or exempted from them  This may be done two ways  By searching into the causes from whence they may or usually do arise  Which kind has actually bin most frequently and dangerously disturb'd by them  To the first Seditions Tumults and Wars do arise from mistake or from malice from just occasions or unjust From mistake when a People think an evil to be done or intended which is not done nor intended or take that to be evil which is done tho in truth it be not so Well regulated Citys may fall into these errors The  Romans  being jealous of their newly recover'd Liberty thought that  Valerius Publicola  design'd to make himself King when he built a House in a place that seem'd too strong and eminent for a private man The  Spartans  were not less suspicious of  Lycurgus  and a leud young Fellow in a Sedition put out one of his eyes but no People ever continu'd in a more constant affection to their best deserving Citizens than both the  Romans  and  Spartans  afterwards manifested to those vertuous and wrongfully suspected men  Sometimes the fact is true but otherwise understood than was intended When the  Tarquins  were expel'd from  Rome  the Patricians retain'd to themselves the principal Magistracys but never thought of bringing back Kings or of setting up a corrupt Oligarchy among themselves as the Plebeians imagin'd And this mistake being discover'd the fury they  had conceiv'd vanish'd and they who seem'd to intend nothing less than the extirpation of all the Patrician Familys grew quiet  Menenius Agrippa  appeas'd one of the most violent Seditions that ever happen'd amongst them till civil Interests were pursu'd by arm'd Troops with a Fable of the several parts of the Body that murmur'd against the Belly and the most dangerous of all was compos'd by creating Tribuns to protect them Some of the Patrician young men had favour'd the  Decemviri  and others being unwilling to appear against them the People believ'd they had all conspir'd with those new Tyrants but  Valerius  and  Horatius  putting themselves at the head of those who sought their destruction they perceiv'd their Error and look'd upon the  Patricians  as the best defenders of their Libertys  Et inde  says  Livy auram Libertatis captare unde servitutem timuissent  Democratical Governments are most liable to these mistakes In Aristocracys they are seldom seen and we hear of none in  Sparta  after the establishment of the Laws by  Lycurgus  But Absolute Monarchys seem to be totally exempted from them The mischiefs design'd are often dissembled or deny'd till they are past all possibility of being cur'd by any other way than force and such as are by necessity driven to use that remedy know they must perfect their work or perish He that draws his Sword against the Prince say the  French  ought to throw away the Scabbard for tho the design be never so just yet the Authors are sure to be ruin'd if it miscarry Peace is seldom made and never kept unless the Subject retain such a Power in his hands as may oblige the Prince to stand to what is agreed and in time some trick is found to deprive them of that benefit  Seditions proceeding from malice are seldom or never seen in popular Governments for they are hurtful to the People and none have ever willingly and knowingly hurt themselves There may be and often is malice in those who excite them but the People are ever deceiv'd and whatsoever is thereupon done ought to be imputed to error as I said before If this be discover'd in time it usually turns to the destruction of the Contriver as in the cases of  Manlius Capitolinus Spurius Melius  and  Sp Cassius  if not for the most part it produces a Tyranny as in those of  Agathocles Dionysius Pisistrates  and  Cesar  But in Absolute Monarchys almost all the Troubles that arise proceed from malice they cannot be reform'd the extinction of them is exceeding difficult if they have continu'd long enough to corrupt the People and those who appear against 'em seek only to set up themselves or their Friends Thus we see that in the Civil Wars of the East the question was Whether  Artaxerxes  or  Cyrus Phraartes  or  Bardanes  should reign over the  Persians  and  Parthians  The People suffer'd equally from both whilst the Contests lasted and the decision left 'em under the power of a proud and cruel Master The like is seen in all places After the death of  Brutus  and  Cassius  no War was ever undertaken in the  Roman  Empire upon a better account than one man's private concernments The Provinces suffer'd under all and he whom they had assisted to overthrow one wicked Tyrant very often prov'd worse than his Predecessor And the only ground of all the Dissensions with which  France  was vex'd under the Princes of  Meroveus  and  Pepin  's Races were which of them should reign the People remaining miserable under them all  The case is not much different in mix'd Monarchys Some Wars may be undertaken upon a just and publick account but the pretences are commonly false a lasting Reformation is hardly introduc'd an intire Change  often dislik'd And tho such Kingdoms are frequently and terribly distracted as appears by the beforemention'd Examples of  England Spain  c the Quarrels are for the most part begun upon personal Titles as between  Henry  the First and  Robert Stephen  and  Maud  or the Houses of  Lancaster  and  York  and the People who get nothing by the Victory which way soever it fall and might therefore prudently leave the Competitors to decide their own Quarrels like  Theorestes  and  Polinices  with their own Swords become cruelly engag'd in them  It may seem strange to some that I mention Seditions Tumults and Wars upon just occasions but I can find no reason to retract the term God intending that men should live justly with one another dos certainly intend that he or they who do no wrong should suffer none and the Law that forbids Injurys were of no use if no Penalty might be inflicted on those who will not obey it If Injustice therefore be evil and Injurys forbidden they are also to be punish'd and the Law instituted for their prevention must necessarily intend the avenging of such as cannot be prevented The work of the Magistracy is to execute this Law the Sword of Justice is put into their hands to restrain the fury of those within the Society who will not be a Law to themselves and the Sword of War to protect the people against the violence of Foreigners This is without exception and would be in vain if it were not But the Magistrate who is to protect the People from Injury may and is often known not to have done it he sometimes renders his Office useless by neglecting to do Justice sometimes mischievous by overthrowing it This strikes at the root of God's general Ordinance That there should be Laws and the particular Ordinances of all Societys that appoint such as seem best to them The Magistrate therefore is comprehended under both and subject to both as well as private men  The ways of preventing or punishing Injurys are Judicial or Extrajudicial Judicial proceedings are of force against those who submit or may be brought to trial but are of no effect against those who resist and are of such power that they cannot be constrain'd It were absurd to cite a man to appear before a Tribunal who can aw the Judges or has Armys to defend him and impious to think that he who has added Treachery to his other Crimes and usurp'd a Power above the Law should be protected by the enormity of his wickedness Legal proceedings therefore are to be us'd when the Delinquent submits to the Law and all are just when he will not be kept in order by the legal  The word Sedition is generally apply'd to all numerous Assemblys without or against the Authority of the Magistrate or of those who assume that Power  Athaliah  and  Jezabel  were more ready to cry out Treason than  David  and examples of that sort are so frequent that I need not alledg them  Tumult is from the disorderly manner of those Assemblys where things can seldom be done regularly and War is that  Decertatio per vim  or trial by force to which men come when other ways are ineffectual  If the Laws of God and Men are therefore of no effect when the Magistracy is left at liberty to break them and if the Lusts of those who are too strong for the Tribunals of Justice cannot be otherwise restrain'd than by Sedition Tumults and War those Seditions Tumults and Wars are justify'd by the Laws of God and Man  I will not take upon me to enumerate all the cases in which this may be done but content my self with three which have most frequently given occasion for proceedings of this kind  The first is When one or more men take upon them the Power and Name of a Magistracy to which they are not justly call'd  The second When one or more being justly call'd continue in their Magistracy longer than the Laws by which they are call'd do prescribe  And the third When he or they who are rightly call'd do assume a Power tho within the time prescrib'd that the Law dos not give or turn that which the Law dos give to an end different and contrary to that which is intended by it  For the first  Filmer  forbids us to examin Titles he tells us we must submit to the Power whether acquir'd by Usurpation or otherwise not observing the mischievous Absurdity of rewarding the most detestable Villanys with the highest Honors and rendering the veneration due to the supreme Magistrate as Father of the People to one who has no other advantage above his Brethren than what he has gain'd by injuriously dispossessing or murdering him that was so  Hobbs  fearing the advantages that may be taken from such desperate nonsense or not thinking it necessary to his end to carry the matter so far has no regard at all to him who comes in without Title or Consent and denying him to be either King or Tyrant gives him no other name than  Hostis Latro  and allows all things to be lawful against him that may be done to a publick Enemy or Pyrat which is as much as to say any man may destroy him how he can Whatever he may be guilty of in other respects he dos in this follow the voice of Mankind and the dictates of common sense for no man can make himself a Magistrate for himself and no man can have the  De Civ l  right of a Magistrate who is not a Magistrate If he be justly accounted an Enemy to all who injures all he above all must be the publick Enemy of a Nation who by usurping a power over them dos the greatest and most publick injury that a People can suffer For which reason by an establish'd Law among the most vertuous Nations every man might kill a Tyrant and no Names are recorded in History with more honor than of those who did it  These are by other Authors call'd  Tyranni sine titulo  and that name is given to all those who obtain the supreme Power by illegal and unjust means The Laws which they overthrow can give them no protection and every man is a Soldier against him who is a publick Enemy  The same rule holds tho they are more in number as the  Magi  who usurp'd the Dominion of  Persia  after the death of  Cambyses  the thirty Tyrants at  Athens  overthrown by  Thrasibulus  those of  Thebes  slain by  Pelopidas  the  Decemviri  of  Rome  and others For tho the multitude of Offenders may sometimes procure impunity yet that act which is wicked in one must be so in ten or twenty and whatsoever is lawful against one Usurper is so against them all  If those who were rightly created continue beyond the time limited by the Law 'tis the same thing That which is expir'd is as if it had never bin He that was created Consul for a year or Dictator for six months was after that a private man and if he had continu'd in the exercise of his Magistracy had bin subject to the same punishment as if he had usurp'd it at the first This was known to  Epaminondas  who finding that his Enterprize against  Sparta  could not be accomplish'd  within the time for which he was made  Boeotarches  rather chose to trust his Countrymen with his life than to desist and was sav'd merely thro an admiration of his Vertue assurance of his good Intentions and the glory of the Action  The  Roman Decemviri  tho duly elected were proceeded against as private men usurping the Magistracy when they continu'd beyond their time Other Magistrats had ceas'd there was none that could regularly call the Senat or People to an Assembly but when their ambition was manifest and the People exasperated by the death of  Virginia  they laid aside all ceremonys The Senat and People met and exercising their Authority in the same manner as if they had bin regularly call'd by the Magistrate appointed to that end they abrogated the Power of the  Decemviri  proceeded against them as Enemys and Tyrants and by that means preserv'd themselves from utter ruin  The same course is justly us'd against a legal Magistrate who takes upon him tho within the time prescrib'd by the Law to exercise a Power which the Law dos not give for in that respect he is a private man  Quia  as  Grotius  says  eatenus non habet imperium  and may be restrain'd as well as any other because he is not set up to do what he lists but what the Law appoints for the good of the People and as he has no other Power than what the Law allows so the same Law limits and directs the exercise of that which he has This Right naturally belonging to Nations is no way impair'd by the name of  Supreme  given to their Magistrats for it signifys no more than that they do act sovereignly in the matters committed to their charge Thus are the Parliaments of  France  call'd  Cours Souveraines  for they judg of Life and Death determin Controversys concerning Estates and there is no appeal from their Decrees but no man ever thought that it was therefore lawful for them to do what they pleas'd or that they might not be oppos'd if they should attempt to do that which they ought not And tho the  Roman  Dictators and Consuls were supreme Magistrats they were subject to the People and might be punish'd as well as others if they transgrest the Law  Thuanus  carrys the word so far that when  Barlotta Giustiniano  and others who were but Colonels were sent as Commanders in chief of three or four thousand men upon an Enterprize he always says  Summum Imperium ei delatum Grotius  explains this point by distinguishing those who have the  summum Imperium summo modo  from those who have it  modo non summo  I know not where to find an Example of this Sovereign Power enjoy'd without restriction under a better title than  Occupation  which relates not to our purpose who seek only that which is legal and just Therefore laying aside that point for the present we may  De Jur Bell Pac l  follow  Grotius  in examining the right of those who are certainly limited  Ʋbi partem Imperii habet Rex partem Senatus sive Populus  in which case he says  Regi in partem non suam involanti vis justa opponi potest  in as much as they who have a part cannot but have a right of defending that part  Quia data facultate datur jus facultatem tuendi  without which it could be of no effect  The particular limits of the Rights belonging to each can only be judg'd by the precise Letter or general Intention of the Law The Dukes of  Venice  have certainly a part in the Government and could not be call'd Magistrats if they had not They are said to be  supreme  all Laws and publick Acts bear their Names The Embassador of that State speaking  h  an l  to Pope  Paul  the Fifth deny'd that he acknowledg'd any other Superior  than God But they are so well known to be under the Power of the Law that divers of 'em have bin put to death for transgressing it and a marble Gallows is seen at the foot of the stairs in St  Mark  's Palace upon which some of them and no others have bin executed But if they may be duly oppos'd when they commit undue Acts no man of judgment will deny that if one of them by an outrageous Violence should endeavour to overthrow the Law he might by violence be supprest and chastis'd  Again some Magistrats are intrusted with a power of providing Ships Arms Ammunition and Victuals for War raising and disciplining Soldiers appointing Officers to command in Forts and Garisons and making Leagues with Foreign Princes and States But if one of these should imbezel sell or give to an Enemy those Ships Arms Ammunition or Provisions betray the Forts employ only or principally such men as will serve him in those wicked Actions and contrary to the trust repos'd in him make such Leagues with Foreigners as tend to the advancement of his personal Interests and to the detriment of the Publick he abrogates his own Magistracy and the Right he had perishes as the Lawyers say  frustratione finis  He cannot be protected by the Law which he has overthrown nor obtain impunity for his Crimes from the Authority that was confer'd upon him only that he might do good with it He was  singulis major  on account of the excellency of his Office but  universis minor  from the nature and end of his Institution The surest way of extinguishing his Prerogative was by turning it to the hurt of those who gave it When matters are brought to this posture the Author of the mischief or the Nation must perish A Flock cannot subsist under a Shepherd that seeks its ruin nor a People under an unfaithful Magistrate Honor and Riches are justly heap'd upon the heads of those who rightly perform their duty because the difficulty as well as the excellency of the work is great It requires Courage Experience Industry Fidelity and Wisdom  The good Shepherd  says our Saviour  lays down his life for his Sheep  The Hireling who flies in time of danger is represented under an ill character but he that sets himself to destroy his Flock is a Wolf His Authority is incompatible with their subsistence and whoever disapproves Tumults Seditions or War by which he may be remov'd from it if gentler means are ineffectual subverts the Foundation of all Law exalts the fury of one man to the destruction of a Nation and giving an irresistible Power to the most abominable Iniquity exposes all that are good to be destroy'd and Vertue to be utterly extinguish'd  Few will allow such a Preeminence to the Dukes of  Venice  or  Genoa  the Advoyers of  Switzerland  or the Burgomasters of  Amsterdam  Many will say these are Rascals if they prove false and ought rather to be hang'd than suffer'd to accomplish the Villanys they design But if this be confest in relation to the highest Magistrats that are among those Nations why should not the same be in all others by what name soever they are call'd When did God confer upon those Nations the extraordinary privilege of providing better for their own safety than others Or was the Gift universal tho the Benefit accrue only to those who have banish'd great Titles from among them If this be so 'tis not their Felicity but their Wisdom that we ought to admire and imitate But why should any think their Ancestors had not the same care Have not they who retain'd in themselves a Power over a Magistrate of one name the  like over another Is there a charm in words or any name of such efficacy that he who receives it should immediately become Master of those that created him whereas all others do remain for ever subject to them Would the  Venetian  Government change its nature if they should give the name of King to their Prince Are the  Polanders  less sree since the title of King is confer'd upon their Dukes or are the  Moscovites  less Slaves because their chief Magistrate has no other than that of Duke If we examin things but a little 'twill appear that Magistrats have enjoy'd large Powers who never had the name of Kings and none were ever more restrain'd by Laws than those of  Sparta Arragon  the  Goths  in  Spain Hungary Bohemia Sweden Denmark Poland  and others who had that Title There is therefore no such thing as a Right universally belonging to a Name but every one enjoys that which the Laws by which he is con  er upon him The Law that gives the Power regulates it and they who give no more than what they please cannot be oblig'd to suffer him to whom they give it to take more than they thought fit to give or to go unpunish'd if he do The Agreements made are always confirm'd by Oath and the treachery of violating them is consequently aggravated by Perjury They are good Philosophers and able Divines who think this can create a Right to those who had none or that the Laws can be a protection to such as overthrow them and give opportunity of doing the mischiefs they design If it do not then he that was a Magistrate by such actions returns into the condition of a private man and whatever is lawful against a Thief who submits to no Law is lawful against him  Men who delight in cavils may ask Who shall be the Judg of these occasions And whether I intend to give to the People the decision of their own Cause To which I answer that when the contest is between the Magistrate and the People the party to which the determination is refer'd must be the Judg of his own case and the question is only Whether the Magistrate should depend on the Judgment of the People or the People on that of the Magistrate and which is most to be suspected of injustice That is whether the People of  Rome  should judg  Tarquin  or  Tarquin  judg the People He that knew all good men abhor'd him for the murder of his Wife Brother Fatherinlaw and the best of the Senat would certainly strike off the heads of the most eminent remaining Poppys and having incur'd the general hatred of the people by the wickedness of his Government he fear'd revenge and endeavouring to destroy those he fear'd that is the City he might easily have accomplish'd his work if the judgment had bin refer'd to him If the People judg  Tarquin  'tis hard to imagin how they should be brought to give an unjust Sentence They lov'd their former Kings and hated him only for his Villanys They did not fancy but know his cruelty When the best were slain no man that any way resembled them could think himself secure  Brutus  did not pretend to be a Fool till by the murder of his Brother he found how dangerous a thing it was to be thought wise If the people as our Author says be always leud foolish mad wicked and desirous to put the Power into the hands of such as are most like to themselves he and his Sons were such men as they sought and he was sure to find favourable Judges If vertuous and good no injustice was to be fear'd from them and he could have no other reason to decline their judgment than what was suggested by his own wickedness  Caligula Nero Domitian  and the like had probably the same considerations But no man of common  sense ever thought that the Senat and People of  Rome  did not better deserve to judg whether such Monsters should reign over the best part of mankind to their destruction than they to determin whether their Crimes should be punish'd or not  If I mention some of these known Cases every man's experience will suggest others of the like nature and whosoever condemns all Seditions Tumults and Wars rais'd against such Princes must say that none are wicked or seek the ruin of their People which is absurd for  Caligula  wish'd the People had but one Neck that he might cut it off at a blow  Nero  set the City on fire and we have known such as have bin worse than either of them They must either be suffer'd to continue in the free exercise of their rage that is to do all the mischief they design or must be restrain'd by a legal judicial or extrajudicial way and they who disallow the extrajudicial do as little like the judicial They will not hear of bringing a supreme Magistrate before a Tribunal when it may be done  They will  says our Author  depose their Kings  Why should they not be depos'd if they become Enemys to their People and set up an interest in their own persons inconsistent with the publick good for the promoting of which they were erected If they were created by the publick consent for the publick good shall they not be remov'd when they prove to be of publick damage If they set up themselves may they not be thrown down Shall it be lawful for them to usurp a Power over the liberty of others and shall it not be lawful for an injur'd People to resume their own If injustice exalt it self must it be for ever establish'd Shall great Persons be render'd sacred by rapine perjury and murder Shall the crimes for which private men do justly suffer the most grievous punishments exempt them from all who commit them in the highest excess with most power and most to the prejudice of mankind Shall the Laws that solely aim at the prevention of Crimes be made to patronize them and become snares to the innocent whom they ought to protect Has every man given up into the common store his right of avenging the Injurys he may receive that the publick Power which ought to protect or avenge him should be turn'd to the destruction of himself his Posterity and the Society into which they enter without any possibility of redress Shall the Ordinance of God be render'd of no effect or the Powers he has appointed to be set up for the distribution of Justice be made subservient to the lusts of one or a sew men and by impunity incourage them to commit all manner of crimes Is the corruption of man's Nature so little known that such as have common sense should expect Justice from those who sear no punishment if they do Injustice or that the modesty integrity and innocence which is seldom found in one man tho never so cautiously chosen should be constantly found in all those who by any means attain to Greatness and continue for ever in their Successors or that there can be any security under their Government if they have them not Surely if this were the condition of men living under Government Forests would be more safe than Citys and 'twere better for every man to stand in his own defence than to enter into Societys He that lives alone might encounter such as should assault him upon equal terms and stand or fall according to the measure of his courage and strength but no Valor can defend him if the malice of his Enemy be upheld by a publick Power There must therefore be a right of proceeding judicially or extrajudicially against all persons who transgress the Laws or else those Laws and the Societys that should subsist by them  cannot stand and the ends for which Governments are constituted together with the Governments themselves must be overthrown Extrajudicial proceedings by Sedition Tumult or War must take place when the persons concern'd are of such power that they cannot be brought under the Judicial They who deny this deny all help against an usurping Tyrant or the perfidiousness of a lawfully created Magistrate who adds the crimes of Ingratitude and Treachery to Usurpation These of all men are the most dangerous Enemys to supreme Magistrats for as no man desires indemnity for such Crimes as are never committed he that would exempt all from punishment supposes they will be guilty of the worst and by concluding that the People will depose them if they have the power acknowledg that they pursue an Interest annex'd to their Persons contrary to that of their People which they would not bear if they could deliver themselves from it This shewing all those Governments to be tyrannical lays such a burden upon those who administer them as must necessarily weigh them down to destruction  If it be said that the word Sedition implys that which is evil I answer that it ought not then to be apply'd to those who seek nothing but that which is just and tho the ways of delivering an opprest People from the violence of a wicked Magistrate who having arm'd a Crew of leud Villains and fatted them with the Blood and Confiscations of such as were most ready to oppose him be extraordinary the inward righteousness of the Act dos fully justify the Authors He that has vertue and power to save a People can never want a right of doing it  Valerius Asiaticus  had no hand in the death of  Caligula  but when the furious Guards began tumultuously to inquire who had kill'd him he appeased them with  wishing he had bin the man  No wise man ever ask'd by what authority  Thrasibulus Harmodius Aristogiton Pelopidas Epaminondas Dion Timoleon Lucius Brutus Publicola Horatius Valerius Marcus Brutus C Cassius  and the like deliver'd their Countrys from Tyrants Their Actions carry'd in them their own justification and their Vertues will never be forgotten whilst the names of  Greece  and  Rome  are remember'd in the World  If this be not enough to declare the Justice inherent in and the Glory that ought to accompany these Works the examples of  Moses Aaron Othniel Ehud Barac Gideon Samuel Jephtha David Jehu Jehoiada  the  Maccabees  and other holy men rais'd up by God for the deliverance of his People from their Oppressors decide the Question They are perpetually renown'd for having led the People by extraordinary ways which such as our Author express under the names of Sedition Tumult and War to recover their Libertys and avenge the injurys receiv'd from foreign or domestick Tyrants The work of the Apostles was not in their time to set up or pull down any civil State but they so behav'd themselves in relation to all the Powers of the Earth that they gain'd the name of pestilent seditious Fellows Disturbers of the People and left it as an inheritance to those who in succeeding Ages by following their steps should deserve to be call'd their Successors whereby they were expos'd to the hatred of corrupt Magistrats and brought under the necessity of perishing by them or desending themselves against them and he that denys them that right dos at once condemn the most glorious Actions of the wisest best and holiest men that have bin in the world together with the Laws of God and Man upon which they were founded  Nevertheless there is a sort of Sedition Tumult and War proceeding from Malice which is always detestable aiming only at the satisfaction of private Lust without regard to the publick Good This cannot happen in a Popular Government unless it be amongst the Rabble or when the Body of the People is so corrupted that it cannot stand but is most frequent in and natural to absolute Monarchys When  Abimelech  desir'd  Judg  to make himself King he rais'd a Tumult among the basest of the People He hir'd light and vain Persons some Translations call them leud Vagabonds kill'd his Brethren but perish'd in his design the corrupt party that favor'd him not having Strength enough to subdue the other who were more sincere  Sp Melius Sp Cassius  and  Manlius  attempted the like in  Rome  they acted maliciously their pretences to procure the publick Good were false 'Tis probable that some in the City were as bad as they and knew that mischief was intended but the Body of the People not being corrupted they were supprest It appear'd says  Livy Nihil esse minus populare quam regnum  they who had favor'd  Manlius  condemn'd him to death when it was prov'd that  egregias alioqui virtutes foeda regni cupidine maculasset  But when the People is generally corrupted such designs seldom miscarry and the success is always the erection of a Tyranny Nothing else can please vain and profligate persons and no Tyranny was ever set up by such as were better qualify'd The ways of attaining it have always bin by corrupting the manners of the People bribing Soldiers entertaining mercenary Strangers opening Prisons giving Liberty to Slaves alluring indigent persons with hopes of abolishing Debts coming to a new division of Lands and the like Seditions rais'd by such men always tend to the ruin of popular Governments but when they happen under absolute Monarchys the hurt intended is only to the Person who being remov'd the Promoters of 'em set up another and he that is set up subsisting only by the strength of those who made him is oblig'd to foment the Vices that drew them to serve him tho another may perhaps make use of the same against him  The consequence of this is That those who uphold popular Governments look upon Vice and Indigence as mischiefs that naturally increase each other and equally tend to the ruin of the State When men are by Vice brought into want they are ready for mischief there is no Villany that men of profligate Lives lost Reputation and desperate Fortunes will not undertake Popular Equality is an enemy to these and they who would preserve it must preserve integrity of Manners Sobriety and an honest contentedness with what the Law allows On the other side the absolute Monarch who will have no other Law than his own Will desires to increase the number of those who thro leudness and beggery may incline to depend upon him tho the same temper of Mind and condition of Fortune prepare them also for such Seditions as may bring him into danger and the same corruption which led them to set him up may invite them to sell him to another that will give them better wages  I do not by this conclude that all Monarchs are vicious men but that whoever will set up an absolute Power must do it by these means and that if such a Power be already establish'd and should fall into the hands of a person who by his Vertue and the gentleness of his Nature should endeavor to render the Yoke so easy that a better disciplin'd People might be contented to bear it yet this method could last no longer than  his life and probably would be a means to shorten it that which was at first establish'd by evil Arts always returning to the same That which was vicious in the principle can never be long upheld by Vertue and we see that the worst of the  Roman  Emperors were not in greater danger from such good men as remain'd undestroy'd than the best from the corrupt Party that would not be corrected and sought such a Master as would lay no restriction upon their Vices Those few who escap'd the rage of these Villains only gave a little breathing time to the afflicted World which by their Children or Successors was again plung'd into that extremity of misery from which they intended to deliver it An extraordinary Vertue was requir'd to keep a Prince in a way contrary to the principles of his own Government which being rarely found and never continuing long in a Family or Succession of men the endeavors of the best became ineffectual and either they themselves perish'd in them or after their death all things return'd into the old polluted Channel  Tho the Power of the Hebrew Kings was not unlimited yet it exceeded the Rules set by God and was sufficient to increase the number of the worst of men and to give them opportunitys of raising perpetual disturbances On the King's side there were Flatterers and Instruments of mischief On the other side there were indebted and discontented Persons Notwithstanding the Justice of  David  's cause the Wisdom Valor and Piety of his Person none would follow him except a few of his own Kindred who knew what God had promis'd to him and such as were uneasy in their worldly circumstances After the death of  Saul  there was a long and bloody War between  Ishbosheth  and  David  The former being kill'd the slightest matters were sufficient to put the whole Nation into blood  Absalom  with a few fair words was able to raise all  Israel  against his Father  Sheba  the Son of  Bichri  with as much ease rais'd a more dangerous Tumult  David  by Wisdom Valor and the Blessing of God surmounted these Difficultys and prepar'd a peaceable Reign for  Solomon  but after his death they broke out into a Flame that was never quench'd till the Nation was so dispers'd that no man knew where to find his Enemys  Solomon  by his Magnificence had reduc'd  Israel  to such poverty as inclin'd them to revolt upon the first offer of an opportunity by  Jeroboam  From that time forward  Israel  was perpetually vex'd with Civil Seditions and Conspiracys or Wars with their Brethren of  Judah  Nine Kings with their Familys were destroy'd by the first and the latter brought such Slaughters upon the miserable People as were never suffer'd by any who were not agitated by the like Fury and the course of these mischiefs was never interrupted till they had brought the Nation into Captivity and the Country to Desolation Tho God according to his promise did preserve a light in the House of  David  yet the Tribe of  Judah  was not the more happy  Joash  was slain by a private Conspiracy and  Amaziah  as is most probable by publick Authority for having foolishly brought a terrible Slaughter upon  Judah Athaliah  destroy'd the King's Race and was kill'd her self by  Jehoiada  who not having learn'd from our Author to regard the Power only and not the ways by which it was obtain'd caus'd her to be drag'd out of the Temple and put to a welldeserv'd Death The whole Story is a Tragedy and if it be pretended that this proceeded rather from the wrath of God against his People for their Idolatry than from such causes as are applicable to other Nations I answer that this Idolatry was the  production of the Government they had set up and most sutable to it and chusing rather to subject themselves to the Will of a man than to the Law of God they deservedly suffer'd the evils that naturally follow the worst Counsels We know of none who taking the like course have not suffer'd the like miserys Notwithstanding the admirable Vertue and Success of  Alexander  his Reign was full of Conspiracys and his knowledg of them prompted him to destroy  Parmenio Philotas Clitus Calisthenes Hermolaus  and many more of his best Friends If he escap'd the Sword he fell by Poison The Murder of his Wives Mother and Children by the rage of his own Soldiers the Fury of his Captains imploy'd in mutual Slaughters till they were consum'd his paternal Kingdom after many Revolutions transfer'd to  Cassander  his most mortal Enemy the utter extinction of his conquering Army and particularly the famous  Argyraspides  who being grown faithless and seditious after the death of  Eumenes  were sent to perish in unknown parts of the East abundantly testify the admirable stability good order peace and quiet that is enjoy'd under absolute Monarchy The next Government of the like nature that appear'd upon the Stage of the World was that of  Rome  introduc'd by Wars that consum'd two thirds of the People confirm'd by Proscriptions in which all that were eminent for Nobility Riches or Vertue perish'd The peace they had under  Augustus  was like that which the Devil allow'd to the Child in the Gospel whom he rent  Mark  sorely and left as dead The miserable City was only cast into a Swound after long and violent vexations by Seditions Tumults and Wars it lay as dead and finding no helper like to him who cur'd the Child it was deliver'd to new Devils to be tormented till it was utterly destroy'd  Tiberius  was appointed as a fit instrument for such a purpose It was thought that those who should feel the effects of his Pride Cruelty and Lust would look upon the Death of  Augustus  as a loss He perform'd the work for which he was chosen his Reign was an uninterrupted Series of Murders Subornations Perjurys and Poisonings intermix'd with the most detestable Impuritys the revolts of Provinces and Mutinys of Armys The matter was not mended by his Successors  Caligula  was kill'd by his own Guards  Claudius  poison'd by his Wife  Spain Gaul Germany Pannonia Maesia Syria  and  Aegypt  revolted at once from  Nero  the People and Senat follow'd the example of the Provinces This I think was in our Author's sense Sedition with a witness  Nero  being dead by the hand of a Slave or his own to prevent that of the Hangman  Galba  enter'd the City with Blood and Slaughter but when his own Soldiers found he would not give the Mony for which they intended to sell the Empire they kill'd him and to shew the stability of Absolute Monarchy it may be observ'd that this was not done by the advice of the Senat or by a conspiracy of great men  Suscepere duo manipulares  C Tacit Hist▪ l  Populi Romani Imperium transferendum transtulerunt  Two Rascals gave the Empire to  Otho  and the whole Senat was like to be butcher'd for not being so ready to follow their venerable Authority as they ought to have bin and hardly escap'd the fury of their mad and drunken Companions As a farther testimony that these Monarchys are not subject to Seditions and Tumults he had at once only two Competitors against whom he was to defend the wellacquir'd Empire His Army was deseated at  Brescia  he kill'd himself and his Successor  Vitellius  was soon after thrown into the Commonshore The same method still continu'd  Rome  was fill'd with Blood and Ashes and to recite all the  publick Mischiefs would be to transcribe the History For as  Pyrrhus  being ask'd who should succeed him answer'd He who has the sharpest Sword that was the only Law that govern'd in the following ages Whoever could corrupt two or three Legions thought he had a good title to the Empire and unless he happen'd to be kill'd by Treachery or another Tumult of his own Soldiers he seldom receded from it without a Battel wherein he that was most successful had no other security than what the present temper of the Soldiers afforded him and the miserable Provinces having neither Vertue nor Force were oblig'd slavishly to follow the fury or fortune of those Villains In this state did  Rome  dedicate to  Constantine  the Triumphal Arch that had bin prepar'd for  Maxentius  and those Provinces which had set up  Albinus  and  Niger  submitted to  Septimius Severus  In the vast variety of Accidents that in those Ages disturb'd the World no Emperor had a better title than what he purchas'd by Mony or Violence and enjoy'd it no longer than those helps continu'd which of all things were the most uncertain By this means most of the Princes perish'd by the Sword  Italy  was made desolate and  Rome  was several times sack'd and burnt The Mistress of the World being made a Slave the Provinces which had bin acquir'd by the Blood of her antient vertuous Citizens became part of an Usurper's Patrimony who without any regard to the publick good distributed 'em to his Children according to their number or his passion These either destroy'd one another or fell under the Sword of a third who had the fortune of their Father the greatest part most commonly falling to the share of the worst If at any time the contrary happen'd the Government of the best was but a lucid interval and wellwishing men grew more extremely to abhor the darkness that follow'd when they were gone The best of 'em could do no more than suspend mischief for a while but could not correct the corrupt principle of their Government and some of 'em were destroy'd as soon as they were thought to intend it Others who finish'd their days in peace left the Empire to such persons of their relations as were most unlike to them  Domitian  came in as Brother to  Titus Commodus  and  Heliogabalus  were recommended by the memory of those Vertues that had bin found in  Antoninus  and  Aurelius Honorius  and  Arcadius  who by their baseness brought utter ruin upon the Western and Eastern Empires were the Sons of the brave  Theodosius  They who could keep their hands free from Blood and their Hearts from Malice Covetousness and Pride could not transmit their Vertues to their Successors nor correct the perverseness that lay at the root and foundation of their Government The whole mass of Blood was vitiated the Body was but one vast Sore which no hand but that of the Almighty could heal and he who from an abhorrence of iniquity had declar'd he would not hear the crys of his own people when they had chosen the thing that was not good would not shew mercy to Strangers who had done the same thing  I have insisted upon the  Hebrew Macedonian  and  Roman  Historys because they are the most eminent and best known to us We are in the dark concerning the  Babylonian Assyrian Chaldean Bactrian  and  Egyptian  Monarchys We know little more of them than the Scripture occasionally relates concerning their barbarous cruelty bestial pride and extravagant folly Others have bin like to them and I know not where to find a peaceable Monarchy unless it be in  Peru  where the  Ynca Gar  ilasso de la Vega  says that a Man and a Woman Children of the Sun and the  Moon appearing amongst a barbarous people living without any Religion or Law establish'd a Government amongst them which continu'd in much Peace and Justice for twelve Generations But this seeming to be as fabulous as their Birth we may pass it over and fix upon those that are better known of which there is not one that has not suffer'd more dangerous and mischievous Seditions than all the popular Governments that have bin in the World And the condition of those Kingdoms which are not absolute and yet give a preference to Birth without consideration of Merit or Vertue is not much better  This is prov'd by the Reasons of those Seditions and Tumults as well as from the Fact it self  The Reasons arise from the violence of the Passions that incite men to them and the intricacy of the Questions concerning Succession  Every man has Passions few know how to moderate and no one can wholly extinguish them As they are various in their nature so they are govern'd by various Objects and men usually follow that which is predominant in them whether it proceed from Anger or Desire and whether it terminate in Ambition Covetousness Lust or any other more or less blamable Appetite Every manner of life furnishes something that in some measure may foment these but a Crown comprehends all that can be grateful to the most violent and vicious He who is covetous has vast Revenues besides what he may get by fraud and rapine to satisfy his Appetite If he be given to Sensuality the variety of pleasures and the facility of accomplishing whatever he desires tends farther to inflame that Passion Such as are ambitious are incited by the greatness of their Power to attempt great matters and the most sottish or lazy may discharge themselves of Cares and hope that others will be easily hir'd to take the burden of Business upon them whilst they lie at ease They who naturally incline to pride and cruelty are more violently tempted to usurp Dominion and the wicked Advices of Flatterers always concurring with their Passions incite them to exercise the Power they have gotten with the utmost rigor to satiate their own rage and to secure themselves against the effects of the publick hatred which they know they have deserv'd If there be as our Author says no other Rule than Force and Success and that he must be taken for the Father of a People who is in possession of a Power over them whoever has the one may put the other to a trial Nay even those who have regard to Justice will seldom want Reasons to persuade them that it is on their side Something may be amiss in the State Injurys may be done to themselves and their Friends Such Honors may be deny'd as they think they deserve or others of less Merit as they suppose may be prefer'd before them Men do so rarely make a right estimate of their own Merits that those who mean well may be often deceiv'd and if nothing but Success be requir'd to make a Monarch they may think it just to attempt whatever they can hope to accomplish This was the case of  Julius Caesar  he thought all things  Viribus utendum est quas fecimus arma cenenti  Omnia dat qui justa negat  Lu  an  lawful when the Consulat which he suppos'd he had deserv'd was deny'd These Enterprizes seem to belong to men of great Spirits but there are none so base not to be capable of undertaking and as things may stand of bringing 'em to perfection History  represents no man under a more contemptible character of sottis  Laziness Cowardice and Drunkenness than  Vitellius  no one more impure and sordid than  Galba Otho  was advanc'd for being in his manners like to  Nero Vespasian  was scorn'd for his Avarice till the Power fell into such hands as made the world believe none could be unworthy of the Empire and in the following Ages the worst men by the worst means most frequently obtain'd it  These Wounds are not cur'd by saying that the Law of God and Nature prevents this mischief by annexing the Succession of Crowns to proximity of Blood for mankind had not bin continually afflicted with them if there had bin such a Law or that they could have bin prevented by it and tho there were such a Law yet more Questions would arise about that Proximity than any wise man would dare to determin The Law can be of no effect unless there be a Power to decide the Contests arising upon it But the fundamental Maxim of the great Monarchys is that there can be no  Interregnum  The Heir of the Crown is in possession as soon as he who did injoy it is dead  Le Mort  as the  French  say  Saisit le vif  There can be therefore no such Law or it serves for nothing If there be Judges to interpret the Law no man is a King till judgment be given in his favor and he is not King by his own Title but by the Sentence given by them If there be none the Law is merely imaginary and every man may in his own case make it what he pleases He who has a Crown in his view and Arms in his hand wants nothing but success to make him a King and if he prospers all men are oblig'd to obey him  'Tis a folly to say the matter is clear and needs no decision for every man knows that no Law concerning privat Inheritances can be so exactly drawn but many Controversys will arise upon it that must be decided by a Power to which both Partys are subject and the disputes concerning Kingdoms are so much the more difficult because this Law is no where to be found and the more dangerous because the Competitors are for the most part more powerful  Again this Law must either be general to all Mankind or particular to each Nation If particular a matter of such importance requires good proof when where how and by whom it was given to every one But the Scriptures testifying to the contrary that God gave Laws to the  Jews  only and that no such thing as hereditary Monarchy according to proximity of Blood was prescrib'd by them we may safely say that God never gave any such Law to every particular nor to any Nation If he did not give it to any one he did not give it to all for every one is comprehended in all and if no one has it 'tis impossible that all can have it or that it should be obligatory to all when no man knows or can tell when where and by what hand it was given nor what is the sense of it all which is evident by the various Laws and Customs of Nations in the disposal of hereditary Successions And no one of them that we know has to this day bin able to shew that the method follow'd by them is more according to nature than that of others  If our Author pretends to be God's Interpreter and to give the solution of these doubts I may ask which of the five following ways are appointed by God and then we may examin Cases resulting from them  In  France Turky  and other places the Succession comes to the next Male in the streight eldest Line according to which the Son is prefer'd before the Brother of him who last enjoy'd the Crown as the present King of  France  before his Uncle the Duke of  Orleans  and the Son of the eldest before the Brothers of the eldest as in the case of  Richard  the Second of  England  who was advanc'd preferably to all the Brothers of the black Prince his Father  Others keep to the Males of the reigning Family yet have more regard to the eldest Man than to the eldest Line and Representation taking no place among them the eldest Man is thought to be nearest to the first King and a second Son of the Person that last reign'd to be nearer to him than his Grandchild by the eldest Son according to which Rule any one of the Sons of  Edward  the Third remaining after his death should have bin prefer'd before  Richard  the Second who was his Grandchild  In the two cases beforemention'd no manner of regard is had to Females who being thought naturally uncapable of commanding Men or performing the Functions of a Magistrate are together with their Descendents utterly excluded from the supreme as well as from the inferior Magistracys and in  Turky France  and other great Kingdoms have no pretence to any Title But in some places and particularly in  England  the advantages of Proximity belong to them as well as to Males by which means our Crown has bin transported to several Familys and Nations  As in some places they are utterly rejected and in others receiv'd simply without any condition so those are not wanting where that of not marrying out of the Country or without the consent of the Estates is impos'd of which  Sweden  is an Example  In some places Proximity of Blood is only regarded whether the Issue be legitimate or illegitimate in others Bastards are wholly excluded  By this variety of Judgments made by several Nations upon this Point it may appear that tho it were agreed by all that the next in Blood ought to succeed yet such Contests would arise upon the interpretation and application of the general Rule as must necessarily be a perpetual Spring of irreconcilable and mortal Quarrels  If any man say The Rule observ'd in  England  is that which God gave to Mankind I leave him first to dispute that point with the Kings of  France  and many others who can have no right to the Crowns they wear if it be admitted and in the next place to prove that our Ancestors had a more immediate communication with God and a more certain knowledg of his Will than others who for any thing we know may be of Authority equal to them But in the mean time we may rationally conclude that if there be such a Rule we have had no King in  England  for the space of almost a thousand years having not had one who did not come to the Crown by a most manifest violation of it as appears by the forecited Examples of  William  the First and Second  Henry  the First  Henry  the Second and his Children  John Edward  the Third  Henry  the Fourth  Edward  the Fourth and his Children  Henry  the Seventh and all that claim under any of them And if Possession or Success can give a right it will I think follow that  Jack Straw Wat Tyler Perkin Warbeck  or any other Rascal might have had it if he had bin as happy as bold in his Enterprize This is no less than to expose Crowns to the first  that can seize them to destroy all Law and Rule and to render Right a slave to Fortune If this be so a late Earl of  Pembroke  whose understanding was not thought great judg'd rightly when he said his Grandfather was a wise man tho he could neither write nor read in as much as he resolv'd to follow the Crown tho it were upon a Coalstaff But if this be sufficient to make a wise man 'tis pity the secret was no sooner discover'd since many who for want of it liv'd and dy'd in all the infamy that justly accompanys Knavery Cowardice and Folly might have gain'd the reputation of the most excellent Men in their several ages The bloody Factions with which all Nations subject to this sort of Monarchy have bin perpetually vex'd might have bin prevented by throwing up cross or pile or by battel between the Competitors body to body as was done by  Corbis  and  Orsua Cleorestes  and  Polinices Ironside  and  Canutus  it being most unreasonable or rather impiously absurd for any to venture their Lives and Fortunes when their Consciences are not concern'd in the Contest and that they are to gain nothing by the Victory  If Reason teaches that till this expeditious way of ending Controversys be receiv'd the Ambition of men will be apt to imbroil Nations in their Quarrels and others judging variously of those matters which can be reduc'd to no certain Rule will think themselves in Conscience oblig'd to follow the party that seems to them to be most just Experience manifests the same and that Ambition has produc'd more violent mischiefs than all the other desires and passions that have ever possest the hearts of men That this may appear it will not be amiss to divide these mischiefs into such as proceed from him who is in possession of the Power thro jealousy of State as they call it to prevent the enterprizes of those who would dispossess him and such as arise between Competitors contending for it  Tarquin  's Counsel concerning the Poppys and  Periander  's heads of Corn are of the first sort The most eminent are always most fear'd as the readiest to undertake and most able to accomplish great Designs This eminence proceeds from Birth Riches Vertue or Reputation and is sometimes wrought up to the greatest height by a conjunction of all these But I know not where to find an example of such a man who could long subsist under Absolute Monarchy If he be of high Birth he must like  Brutus  conceal his Vertue and gain no reputation or resolve to perish if he do not prevent his own death by that of the Tyrant All other ways are ineffectual the suspicions fears and hatred thereupon arising are not to be remov'd Personal respects are forgotten and such services as cannot be sufficiently valu'd must be blotted out by the death of those who did them Various ways may be taken and pretences us'd according to the temper of Times and Nations but the thing must be done and whether it be colour'd by a trick of Law or perform'd by a Mute with a Bowstring imports little  Henry  the fourth was made King by the Earl of  Northumberland  and his brave Son  Hotspur Edward  the fourth by the valiant Earl of  Warwick Henry  the seventh by  Stanley  but neither of 'em could think himself safe till his Benefactor was dead No continu'd fidelity no testimonys of modesty and humility can prevent this The modesty of  Germanicus  in rejecting the Honors that were offer'd to him and his industry in quieting the mutiny'd Legions accelerated his ruin When 'twas evident he might be Emperor if he pleas'd he must be so or die There was no middle station  between the Throne and the Grave 'Tis probable that  Caligula Nero  and other Beasts like to them might hate Vertue for the good which is in it but I cannot think that either they their Predecessors or Successors would have put themselves upon the desperate design of extirpating it if they had not found it to be inconsistent with their Government and that being once concluded they spar'd none of their nearest Relations  Artaxerxes  kill'd his Son  Darius Herod  murder'd the best of his Wives and all his Sons except the worst  Tiberius  destroy'd  Agrippa Postuhmus  and  Germanicus  with his Wife and two Sons How highly soever  Constantine  the Great be commended he was polluted with the Blood of his Fatherinlaw Wife and Son  Philip  the second of  Spain  did in like manner deliver himself from his fears of  Don Carlos  and 'tis not doubted that  Philip  the fourth for the same reasons dispatch'd his Brother  Don Carlos  and his Son  Balthasar  The like cases were so common in  England  that all the  Plantagenets  and the noble Familys ally'd to them being extinguish'd our Ancestors were sent to seek a King in one of the meanest in  Wales  This method being known those who are unwilling to die so tamely endeavour to find out ways of defending themselves and there being no other than the death of the Person who is in the Throne they usually seek to compass it by secret Conspiracy or open Violence and the number of Princes that have bin destroy'd and Countrys disturb'd by those who thro fear have bin driven to extremitys is not much less than of those who have suffer'd the like from men following the impulse of their own Ambition  The disorders arising from Contests between several Competitors before any one could be settled in the possession of Kingdoms have bin no less frequent and bloody than those abovemention'd and the miserys suffer'd by them together with the ruin brought upon the Empires of  Macedon  and  Rome  may be sufficient to prove it however to make the matter more clear I shall alledg others But because it may be presumption in me to think I know all the Historys of the World or tedious to relate all those I know I shall content my self with some of the most eminent and remarkable And if it appears they have all suffer'd the same mischiefs we may believe they proceed not from Accidents but from the power of a permanent Cause that always produces the same or the like Effects  To begin with  France  The Succession not being well settled in the time of  Meroveus  who had dispossest the Grandchildren of  Pharamond  he was no sooner dead than  Gillon  set up himself and with much slaughter drove his Son  Chilperic  out of the Kingdom who after a little time returning with like fury is said to have seen a Vision first of Lions and Leopards then of Bears and Wolves and lastly of Dogs and Cats all tearing one another to pieces This has bin always accounted by the  French  Hist de France en la Vie de Chilperic  to be a representation of the nature and fortune of the three Races that were to command them and has bin too much verify'd by experience  Clovis  their first Christian and most renowned King having by good means or evil exceedingly enlarg'd his Territorys but chiefly by the murders of  Alaric  and  Ragnacaire  with his Children and suborning  Mezeray de Serres  Sigismond  of  Metz  to kill his Father  Sigebert  left his Kingdom to be torn in pieces by the rage of his four Sons each of 'em endeavouring to make himself Master of the whole and when according to the usual fate of such Contests success had crown'd  Clothair  who was the worst of 'em  all by the  laughter of his Brothers and Nephews with all the flower of the  French  and  Gaulish  Nobility the advantages of his Fortune only resulted to his own person For after his death the miserable Nations suffer'd as much srom the madness of his Sons as they had done by himself and his Brothers They had learn'd from their Predecessors not to be slow in doing mischief but were farther incited by the rage of two infamous Strumpets  Fredegonde  and  Brunehaud  which is a sort of Vermin that I am inclin'd to think has not usually govern'd Senats or Popular Assemblys  Chilperic  the second who by the slaughter of many Persons of the Royal Blood with infinite numbers of the Nobility and People came to be Master of so much of the Country as procur'd him the name of King of  France  kill'd his eldest Son on suspicion he was excited against him by  Brunehaud  and his second lest he should revenge the death of his Brother he marry'd  Fredegonde  and was soon after kill'd by her Adulterer  Landry  The Kingdom continu'd in the same misery thro the rage of the surviving Princes and found no relief tho most of 'em fell by the Sword and that  Brunehaud  who had bin a principal Cause of those Tragedys was ty'd to the tails of four wild Horses and suffer'd a death as foul as her life These were Lions and Leopards They involv'd the Kingdom in desperate troubles but being Men of valor and industry they kept up in some measure the Reputation and Power of the Nation and he who attain'd to the Crown defended it But they being fallen by the hands of each other the poisonous Root put forth another Plague more mortal than their Fury The vigor was spent and the Succession becoming more settled ten base and slothful Kings by the  French  called  Les Roys faineans  succeeded Some may say They who do nothing do no hurt but the Rule is false in relation to Kings He that takes upon him the Government of a People can do no greater evil than by doing nothing nor be guilty of a more unpardonable Crime than by Negligence Cowardice Voluptuousness and Sloth to desert his charge Vertue and Manhood perish under him good Disciplin is forgotten Justice slighted the Laws perverted or render'd useless the People corrupted the publick Treasures exhausted and the Power of the Government always falling into the hands of Flatterers Whores Favorites Bauds and such base Wretches as render it contemptible a way is laid open for all manner of disorders The greatest cruelty that has bin known in the world if accompany'd with wit and courage never did so much hurt as this slothful bestiality or rather these slothful Beasts have ever bin most cruel The Reigns of  Septimius Severus Mahomet  the second or  Selim  the second were cruel and bloody but their fury was turn'd against Foreigners and some of their near Relations or against such as fell under the suspicion of making attempts against them The condition of the People was tolerable those who would be quiet might be safe the Laws kept their right course the Reputation of the Empire was maintain'd the Limits defended and the publick Peace preserv'd But when the Sword past into the hands of leud slothful foolish and cowardly Princes it was of no power against foreign Enemys or the disturbers of domestic Peace tho always sharp against the best of their own Subjects No man knew how to secure himself against them unless by raising civil Wars which will always be srequent when a Crown defended by a weak hand is propos'd as a Prize to any that dare invade it This is a perpetual Spring of disorders and no Nation was ever quiet when the most eminent men found less danger in the most violent Attempts than in submitting patiently to the  Will of a Prince that suffers his Power to be manag'd by vile Persons who get credit by flattering him in his Vices But this is not all such Princes naturally hate and fear those who excel them in Vertue and Reputation as much as they are inferior to them in Fortune and think their Persons cannot be secur'd nor their Authority enlarg'd except by their destruction 'Tis ordinary for them  inter scorta ganeas principibus  C Tacit  viris perniciem machinare  and to make Cruelty a cover to Ignorance and Cowardice Besides the Mischiefs brought upon the Publick by the loss of eminent Men who are the Pillars of every State such Reigns are always accompany'd with Tumults and Civil Wars the great Men striving with no less violence who shall get the weak Prince into his power when such regard is had to succession that they think it not fit to devest him of the Title than when with less respect they contend for the Sovereignty it self And whilst this sort of Princes reign'd  France  was not less afflicted with the Contests between  Grimbauld Ebroin Grimoald  and others for the Mayoralty of the Palace than they had bin before by the rage of those Princes who had contested for the Crown The Issue also was the same After many Revolutions  Charles Martel  gain'd the Power of the Kingdom which he had so bravely defended against the  Saracens  and having transmitted it to his Son  Pepin  the General Assembly of Estates with the approbation of Mankind confer'd the Title also upon him This gave the Nation ease for the present but the deeprooted Evil could not be so cur'd and the Kingdom that by the Wisdom Valor and Reputation of  Pepin  had bin preserv'd from civil Troubles during his life fell as deeply as ever into them so soon as he was dead His Sons  Carloman  and  Charles  divided the Dominions but in a little time each of them would have all  Carloman  fill'd the Kingdom with Tumult rais'd the  Lombards  and march'd with a great Army against his Brother till his course was interrupted by death caus'd as is suppos'd by such helps as Princes liberally afford to their aspiring Relations  Charles  depriv'd his two Sons of their Inheritance put them in Prison and we hear no more of them His third Brother  Griffon  was not more quiet nor more successful and there could be no Peace in  Gascony Italy  or  Germany  till he was kill'd But all the Advantages which  Charles  by an extraordinary Vertue and Fortune had purchas'd for his Country ended with his Life He left his Son  Lewis  the  Gentle  in possession of the Empire and Kingdom of  France  and his Grandson  Bernard  King of  Italy  But these two could not agree and  Bernard  falling into the hands of  Lewis  was depriv'd of his Eyes and some time after kill'd This was not enough to preserve the Peace  Lothair Lewis  and  Pepin  all three Sons to  Lewis  rebel'd against him call'd a Council at  Lions  depos'd him and divided the Empire amongst themselves After five years he escap'd from the Monastery where he had bin kept renew'd the War and was again taken Prisoner by  Lothair  When he was dead the War broke out more fiercely than ever between his Children  Lothair  the Fmperor assaulted  Lewis  King of  Bavaria  and  Charles  King of  Rhetia  was defeated by them and confin'd to a Monastery where he dy'd New Quarrels arose between the two Brothers upon the division of the Countrys taken from him and  Lorrain  only was lest to his Son  Lewis  dy'd soon after and  Charles  getting possession of the Empire and Kingdom ended an inglorious Reign in an unprosperous attempt to deprive  Hermingrade  Daughter to his Brother  Lewis  of the Kingdom of  Arles  and other places left to her by her Father  Lewis  his Son call'd the  Stutterer  reign'd two years in much trouble and his only legitimate Son  Charles  the  Simple  came not to the Crown till after the death of his two Bastard Brothers  Lewis  and  Carloman Charles le Gros  and  Eudes  Duke of  Anjou Charles le Gros  was depos'd from the Empire and Kingdom strip'd of his Goods and left to perish thro poverty in an obscure Village  Charles  the  Simple  and the Nations under him thriv'd no better  Robert  Duke of  Anjou  rais'd War against him and was crown'd at  Rheims  but was himself slain soon after in a bloody battel near  Soissons  His Soninlaw  Hebert  Earl of  Vermandois  gather'd up the remains of his scatter'd Party got  Charles  into his power and call'd a General Assembly of Estates who depos'd him and gave the Crown to  Raoul  Duke of  Burgundy  tho he was no otherwise related to the Royal Blood than by his Mother which in  France  is nothing at all He being dead  Lewis  Son to the depos'd  Charles  was made King but his Reign was as inglorious to him as miserable to his Subjects This is the Peace which the  French  enjoy'd for the space of five or six Ages under their Monarchy and 'tis hard to determin whether they suffer'd most by the Violence of those who possest or the Ambition of others who aspir'd to the Crown and whether the fury of active or the baseness of slothful Princes was most pernicious to them But upon the whole matter thro the defects of those of the latter sort they lost all they had gain'd by sweat and blood under the conduct of the former  Henry  and  Otho  of  Saxony  by a Vertue like that of  Charlemagne  depriv'd them of the Empire and settled it in  Germany  leaving  France  only to  Lewis  sirnam'd  Outremer  and his Son  Lothair  These seem'd to be equally compos'd of Treachery Cruelty Ambition and Baseness They were always mutinous and always beaten Their frantick Passions put 'em always upon unjust designs and were such plagues to their Subjects and Neighbours that they became equally detested and despis'd These things extinguish'd the veneration due to the memory of  Pepin  and  Charles  and oblig'd the whole Nation rather to seek relief from a Stranger than to be ruin'd by their worthless Descendents They had try'd all ways that were in their power depos'd four crowned Kings within the space of a hundred and fifty years crown'd five who had no other Title than the People confer'd upon them and restor'd the Descendents of those they had rejected but all was in vain Their Vices were incorrigible the Mischiefs produc'd by them intolerable they never ceas'd from murdering one another in battel or by treachery and bringing the Nation into Civil Wars upon their wicked or foolish Quarrels till the whole Race was rejected and the Crown plac'd upon the head of  Hugh Capet  These Mischiess rag'd not in the same extremity under him and his Descendents but the abatement proceeded from a cause no way advantageous to Absolute Monarchy The  French  were by their Calamitys taught more strictly to limit the Regal Power and by turning the Dukedoms and Earldoms into Patrimonys which had bin Offices gave an Authority to the chief of the Nobility by which that of Kings was curb'd and tho by this means the Commonalty were expos'd to some Pressures yet they were small in comparison of what they had suffer'd in sormer times When many great Men had Estates of their own that did not depend upon the Will of Kings they grew to love their Country and tho they chearfully serv'd the Crown in all cases of publick Concernment they were not easily engag'd in the personal quarrels of those who possest it or had a mind to gain it To preserve themselves  in this condition they were oblig'd to use their Vassals gently and this continuing in some measure till within the last fifty years the Monarchy was less tumultuous than when the King's Will had bin less restrain'd Nevertheless they had not much reason to boast there was a Root still remaining that from time to time produc'd poisonous Fruit Civil Wars were frequent among them tho not carry'd on with such desperate madness as formerly and many of them upon the account of disputes between Competitors for the Crown All the Wars with  England  since  Edward  the Second marry'd  Isabella  Daughter and as he pretended Heir of  Philip Le Bel  were of this nature The defeats of  Crecy Poitiers  and  Agincourt  with the slaughters and devastations suffer'd from  Edward  the Third the black Prince and  Henry  the Fifth were merely upon Contests for the Crown The Factions of  Orleans  and  Burgundy Orleans  and  Armagnac  proceeded from the same Spring and the Murders that seem to have bin the immediate causes of those Quarrels were only the effects of the hatred growing from their competition The more odious tho less bloody Contests between  Lewis  the  th  and his Father  Charles  the  th  with the jealousy of the former against his Son  Charles  the  th  arose from the same Principle  Charles  of  Bourbon  prepar'd to fill  France  with Fire and Blood upon the like quarrel when his Designs were overthrown by his death in the assault of  Rome  If the Dukes of  Guise  had bin more fortunate they had soon turn'd the cause of Religion into a claim to the Crown and repair'd the Injury done as they pretended to  Pepin  's Race by destroying that of  Capet  And  Henry  the Third thinking to prevent this by the slaughter of  Henry le Balafré  and his Brother the Cardinal  de Guise  brought ruin upon himself and cast the Kingdom into a most horrid confusion Our own Age furnishes us with more than one attempt of the same kind attended with the like success The Duke of  Orleans  was several times in arms against  Lewis  the  th  his Brother the Queenmother drew the  Spaniards  to favour him  Montmorency  perish'd in his Quarrel  Fontrailles  reviv'd it by a Treaty with  Spain  which struck at the King's head as well as the Cardinal's and was supprest by the death of  Cinq Mars  and  de Thou  Those who understand the Affairs of that Kingdom make no doubt that the Count  de Soissons  would have set up for himself and bin follow'd by the best part of  France  if he had not bin kill'd in the pursuit of his Victory at the Battel of  Sedan  Since that time the Kingdom has suffer'd such Disturbances as show that more was intended than the removal of  Mazarin  And the  Marechal de Turenne  was often told that the check he gave to the Prince of  Condé  at  Gien  after he had defeated  Hocquincourt  had preserv'd the Crown upon the King's Head And to testify the Stability good Order and domestick Peace that accompanys Absolute Monarchy we have in our own days seen the House of  Bourbon  often divided within it self the Duke of  Orleans  the Count  de Soissons  and the Princes of  Condé  and  Conti  in war against the King the Dukes of  Angoulesme Vendome Longueville  the Count  de Moret  and other Bastards of the Royal Family following their example the Houses of  Guise D' Elbeuf Bouillon Nemours Rochefocault  and almost all the most eminent in  France  with the Parliaments of  Paris Bourdeaux  and some others joining with them I might alledg many more Examples to shew that this Monarchy as well as all others has from the first establishment bin full of blood and slaughter thro the violence of those who possest the Crown and the Ambition of such as aspir'd to it and that the end of one Civil War has bin the beginning  of another But I presume upon the whole these will be thought sufficient to prove that it never enjoy'd any permanent Domestick Quiet  The Kingdoms of  Spain  have bin no less disturb'd by the same means but especially that of  Castile  where the Kings had more power than in other places To cite all the Examples were to transcribe their Historys but whoever has leisure to examin them will find that after many troubles  Alphonso  the Second notwithstanding his glorious sirname of  Wise  was depos'd by means of his ambitious Son  Don Alonso  sirnam'd  El Desheredado  supplanted by his Uncle  Don Sancho el bravo Peter  the Cruel cast from the Throne and kill'd by his bastard Brother the  Conde de Trastamara  From the time of the abovenam'd  Alphonso  to that of  Ferdinand  and  Isabella  containing about two hundred years so few of them past without Civil Wars that I hardly remember two together that were free from them And whosoever pretends that of late years that Monarchy has bin more quiet must if he be ingenuous confess their Peace is rather to be imputed to the dexterity of removing such Persons as have bin most likely to raise Disturbances of which number were  Don John  of  Austria Don Carlos  Son to  Philip  the Second another of the same name Son to  Philip  the Third and  Don Belthazar  Son to  Philip  the Fourth than to the rectitude of their Constitutions  He that is not convinc'd of these Truths by what has bin said may come nearer home and see what Mischiefs were brought upon  Scotland  Buchan de reb Scot  by the Contests between  Baliol  and  Bruce  with their Consequences till the Crown came to the  Stuart  Family the quiet Reigns and happy  Drummond Melvil  Deaths of the five  James  's together with the admirable Stability and Peace of the Government under Queen  Mary  and the perfect Union in which she liv'd with her Husband Son and People as well as the Happiness of the Nation whilst it lasted  But the Miserys of  England  upon the like occasions surpass all  William  the  Norman  was no sooner dead but the Nation was rent in pieces by his eldest Son  Robert  contesting with his younger Sons  William  and  Henry  for the Crown They being all dead and their Sons the like happen'd between  Stephen  and  Maud Henry  the Second was made King to terminate all Disputes but it prov'd a fruitless Expedient Such as were more scandalous and not less dangerous did soon arise between him and his Sons who besides the Evils brought upon the Nation vex'd him to death by their Rebellion The Reigns of  John  and  Henry  the Third were yet more tempestuous  Edward  the Second's leud foolish infamous and detestable Government ended in his deposition and death to which he was brought by his Wife and Son  Edward  the Third employ'd his own and his Subjects Valor against the  French  and  Scots  but whilst the Foundations were out of order the Nation could never receive any advantage by their Victorys All was calculated for the Glory and turn'd to the Advantage of one Man He being dead all that the  English  held in  Scotland  and in  France  was lost thro the baseness of his Successor with more Blood than it had bin gain'd and the Civil Wars rais'd by his wickedness and madness ended as those of  Edward  the Second had done The Peace of  Henry  the Fourth's Reign was interrupted by dangerous Civil Wars and the Victory obtain'd at  Shrewsbury  had not perhaps secur'd him in the Throne if his Death had not prevented new Troubles  Henry  the Fisth acquir'd such reputation by his  Vertue and Victorys that none dar'd to invade the Crown during his life but immediately after his death the Storms prepar'd against his Family broke out with the utmost violence His Son's weakness encourag'd  Richard  Duke of  York  to set up a new Title which produc'd such Mischiefs as hardly any People have suffer'd unlefs upon the like occasion For besides the slaughter of many thousands of the People and especially of those who had bin accustom'd to Arms the devastation of the best parts of the Kingdom and the loss of all that our Kings had inherited in  France  or gain'd by the blood of their Subjects fourscore Princes of the Blood as  Philip de Commines  calls them dy'd in Battel or under the hand of the Hangman Many of the most noble Familys were extinguish'd others lost their most eminent Men Three Kings and two presumptive Heirs of the Crown were murder'd and the Nation brought to that shameful exigence to set up a young Man to reign over them who had no better cover for his sordid extraction than a Welch Pedegree that might shew how a Tailor was descended from Prince  Arthur Cadwallader  and  Brutus  But the Wounds of the Nation were not to be heal'd with such a Plaister He could not rely upon a Title made up of such stuff and patch'd with a Marriage to a Princess of a very questionable Birth His own meanness inclin'd him to hate the Nobility and thinking it to be as easy for them to take the Crown from him as to give it to him he industriously apply'd himself to glean up the Remainders of the House of  York  from whence a Competitor might arise and by all means to crush those who were most able to oppose him This exceedingly weaken'd the Nobility who held the Balance between him and the Commons and was a great step towards the dissolution of our antient Government but he was so far from settling the Kingdom in peace that such Rascals as  Perkin Warbeck  and  Simnel  were able to disturb it The Reign of  Henry  the Eighth was turbulent and bloody that of  Mary  furious and such as had brought us into subjection to the most powerful proud and cruel Nation at that time in the World if God had not wonderfully protected us Nay  Edward  the Sixth and Queen  Elizabeth  notwithstanding the natural excellency of their Dispositions and their knowledg of the Truth in matters of Religion were forc'd by that which men call  Jealousy of State  to foul their hands so often with illustrious Blood that if their Reigns deserve to be accounted amongst the most gentle of Monarchys they were more heavy than the Government of any Commonwealth and yet their Lives were never secure against such as conspir'd against them upon the account of Title  Having in some measure shew'd what Miserys have bin usually if not perpetually brought upon Nations subject to Monarchys by the violence of some Princes and the baseness folly and cowardice of others together with what they have suffer'd in Contests for the several Crowns whilst men divided into divers Factions strive with as much vehemency to advance the Person they favour as if they or their Country were interested in the quarrel and fight as fiercely for a Master as they might reasonably do to have none I am not able to determin which of the two Evils is the most mortal 'Tis evident the Vices of Princes result to the Damage of the People but whether Pride and Cruelty or Stupidity and Sloth be the worst I cannot tell All Monarchys are subject to be afflicted with Civil Wars but whether the most frequent and bloody do arise from the quarrels of divers Competitors for Crowns before any one  gain the possession of them or afterwards thro the fears of him that would keep what he has gain'd or the rage of those who would wrest it from him is not so easily decided But Commonwealths are less troubled with those Distempers Women Children or such as are notoriously foolish or mad are never advanc'd to the Supreme Power Whilst the Laws and that Disciplin which nourishes Vertue is in force Men of Wisdom and Valor are never wanting and every man desires to give testimony of his Vertue when he knows 'twill be rewarded with Honor and Power If unworthy Persons creep into Magistracys or are by mistake any way prefer'd their Vices for the most part turn to their own hurt and the State cannot easily receive any great damage by the incapacity of one who is not to continue in Office above a year and is usually encompast with those who having born or are aspiring to the same are by their Vertue able to supply his defects cannot hope for a Reward from one unable to corrupt 'em and are sure of the favor of the Senat and People to support 'em in the defence of the publick Interest As long as this good Order continues private Quarrels are supprest by the Authority of the Magistrate or prove to be of little effect Such as arise between the Nobles and Commons frequently produce good Laws for the maintenance of Liberty as they did in  Rome  for above three hundred years after the expulsion of  Tarquin  and almost ever terminate with little or no blood Sometimes the Errors of one or both Partys are discover'd by the discourse of a wise and good Man and those who have most violently oppos'd one another become the best Friends every one joining to remove the evil that causes the division When the Senat and People of  Rome  seem'd to be most furiously incens'd against each other the creation of Tribuns communication of Honors and Marriages between the Patrician and Plebeian Familys or the mitigation of Usury compos'd all and these were not only harmless things but such as gave opportunitys of correcting the defects that had bin in the first Constitution of the Government without which they could never have attain'd to the Greatness Glory and Happiness they afterwards enjoy'd Such as had seen that People meeting in tumult running thro the City crying out against the Kings Consuls Senat or  Decemviri  might have thought they would have fill'd all with blood and slaughter but no such thing happen'd They desir'd no more than to take away the Kingdom which  Tarquin  had wickedly usurp'd and never went about so much as to punish one Minister of the mischiefs he had done or to take away his Goods till upon pretence of treating his Embassadors by a new Treachery had cast the City into greater danger than ever Tho the  Decemviri  had by the like Villanys equally provok'd the People they were us'd with the like gentleness  Appius  T Liv l  Claudius  and  Oppius  having by voluntary death substracted themselves from publick punishment their Collegues were only banish'd and the Magistracys of the City reduc'd to the former order without the effusion of more blood They who contended for their just Rights were satisfy'd with the recovery of them whereas such as follow the impulse of an unruly Ambition never think themselves safe till they have destroy'd all that seem able to disturb them and satiated their rage with the blood of their Adversarys This makes as well as shews the difference between the Tumults of  Rome  or the secession of the common People to Mount  Aventine  and the Battels of  Towton Teuxbury Eveshal Lewes Hexham Barnet St Albans  and  Bosworth  'Tis in vain to say these ought rather to be compar'd to those of  Pharsalia Actium  or  Philippi  sor when the Laws of a Commonwealth are abolish'd the Name also ceases Whatever is done by force or fraud to set up the Interests and Lusts of one man in opposition to the Laws of his Country is purely and absolutely Monarchical Whatsoever past between  Marius Sylla Cinna Catiline Caesar Pompey Crassus Augustus Antonius  and  Lepidus  is to be imputed to the Contests that arise between Competitors for Monarchy as well as those that in the next age happen'd between  Galba Otho Vitellius  and  Vespasian  Or which is worse whereas all men in Commonwealths fight for themselves when there is occasion and if they succeed enjoy the fruits of their Victory▪ so as even those who remain of the vanquish'd party partake of the Liberty thereby establish'd or the good Laws thereupon made such as follow'd the Ensigns of those men who sought to set up themselves did rather like beasts than men hazard and suffer many unspeakable evils to purchase misery to themselves and their Posterity and to make one their Master who increasing in Pride Avarice and Cruelty was to be thrown down again with as much Blood as he had bin set up  These things if I mistake not being in the last degree evident I may leave to our Author all the advantages he can gain by his rhetorical Description of the Tumults of  Rome when Blood was in the Marketplace suckt up with Sponges and the Jakes stuff'd with Carcases  to which he may add the crimes of  Sylla  's Life and the miserys of his Death But withal I desire to know what number of Sponges were sufficient to suck up the Blood of five hundred thousand men slain in one day when the Houses of  David  and  Jeroboam  contended for the Crown of  Israel  or of four hundred thousand who fell in one battel between  Joash  and  Amaziah  on the same occasion what Jakes were capacious enough to contain the Carcases of those that perish'd in the quarrels between the Successors of  Alexander  the several Competiors for the  Roman  Empire or those which happen'd in  France Spain England  and other places upon the like occasions If  Sylla  for some time acted as an absolute Monarch 'tis no wonder that he dy'd like one or that God punish'd him as  Herod Philip  the second of  Spain  and some others because the hand of his fellow▪Citizens had unjustly spar'd him If when he was become detestable to God and Man he became also miserable his example ought to deter others srom the Crimes that are aveng'd by a Power which none can escape and to encourage those who defend or endeavour to recover their violated Libertys to act vigorously in a Cause that God dos evidently patronize  SECT XXV Courts are more subject to Venality and Corruption than Popular Governments  THO Courtflatterers impute many evils to Popular Governments they no way deserve I could not think any so impudent as to lay Corruption and Venality to their charge till I found it in our Author They might in my opinion have taken those faults upon themselves since they certainly abound most where Bawds Whores Buffoons Players Slaves and other base people who are naturally mercenary are most  prevalent And whosoever would know whether this dos more frequently befal Commonwealths than Monarchys especially if they are absolute need only to inquire whether the  Cornelii Junii Fabii Valerii Quintii Curii Fabritii  and others who most prevail'd in  Rome  after the expulsion of the Kings or  Sejanus Macro Narcissus Pallas Icetus Tigellinus Vinnius Laco Agrippina Messalina Lollia Poppaea  and the like were most subject to those base Vices Whether it were more easy to corrupt one or two of those Villains and Strumpets or the Senats and People of  Rome Carthage Athens  and  Sparta  and whether that sort of Rabble had more power over the Princes they serv'd than such as most resembled them had whilst the Popular Government continu'd 'Tis in vain to say those Princes were wicked and vile for many others are so likewise and when the Power is in the hands of one man there can be no assurance he will not be like them Nay when the Power is so plac'd ill men will always find opportunitys of compassing their desires  Bonus cautus optimus Imperator venditur  said  Dioclesian  and tho he was no unwise man yet that which principally induc'd him to renounce the Empire was the impossibility he found of defending himself against those that were in credit with him who daily betray'd and sold him They see with the eyes of other men and cannot resist the frauds that are perpetually put upon them  Antoninus Pius  and  Marcus Aurelius  seem to have bin the best and wisest of all the  Roman  Emperors but the two  Faustina  's had such an ascendent over them as was most shameful to their persons and mischievous to the Empire and the best men in it Such as these may gain too much upon the affections of one man in the best regulated Government but that could be of no great danger to the Publick when many others equal or not much inferior to him in authority are ready to oppose whatever he should endeavour to promote by their impulse but there is no remedy when all depends upon the Will of a single person who is govern'd by them There was more of acuteness and jest than of truth in that saying of  Themistocles That his little boy had more power than any man in  Greece  for he govern'd his Mother she him he  Athens  and  Athens Greece For he himself was found to have little power when for private passions and concernments he departed from the interest of the Publick and the like has bin found in all places that have bin govern'd in the like manner  Again Corruption will always reign most where those who have the power do most favour it where the rewards of such Crimes are greatest easiest and most valu'd and where the punishment of them is least sear'd  For the first we have already prov'd that Liberty cannot be preserv'd if the manners of the People are corrupted nor absolute Monarchy introduc'd where they are sincere which is sufficient to shew that those who manage free Governments ought always to the utmost of their power to oppose Corruption because otherwise both they and their Government must inevitably perish and that on the other hand the absolute Monarch must endeavour to introduce it because he cannot subsist without it 'Tis also so natural for all such Monarchs to place men in power who pretend to love their Persons and will depend upon their pleasure that possibly 'twould be hard to find one in the world who has not made it the rule of his Government And this is not only the way to corruption but the most dangerous of all For tho a good man may love a good Monarch he will obey him only when he commands that which  is just and no one can engage himself blindly to do whatever he is commanded without renouncing all Vertue and Religion because he knows not whether that which shall be commanded is consistent with either or directly contrary to the Laws of God and Man But if such a Monarch be evil and his Actions such as they are too osten found to be whoever bears an affection to him and seconds his designs declares himself an Enemy to all that is good and the advancement of such men to power dos not only introduce foment and increase Corruption but fortifys it in such a manner that without an intire renovation of that State it cannot be remov'd Ill men may possibly creep into any Government but when the worst are plac'd nearest to the Throne and rais'd to Honors for being so they will with that force endeavour to draw all men to a conformity of Spirit with themselves that it can no otherwise be prevented than by destroying them and the Principle in which they live  To the second Man naturally follows that which is good or seems to him to be so Hence it is that in wellgovern'd States where a value is put upon Vertue and no one honor'd unless for such Qualitys as are beneficial to the Publick men are from the tenderest years brought up in a belief that nothing in this world deserves to be sought after but such Honors as are acquir'd by vertuous Actions By this means Vertue it self becomes popular as in  Sparta Rome  and other places where Riches which with the Vanity that follows them and the Honors men give to them are the root of all evil were either totally banish'd or little regarded When no other advantage attended the greatest Riches than the opportunity of living more sumptuously or deliciously men of great Spirits slighted them When  Aristippus  told  Cleanthes  that if he would go to Court and flatter the Tyrant he need not seek his Supper under a hedg the Philosopher answer'd that he who could content himself with such a Supper neednot go to Court or flatter the Tyrant  Epaminondas Aristides Phocion  and even the  Lacedemonian  Kings found no inconvenience in Poverty whilst their Vertue was honor'd and the richest Princes in the world fear'd their Valor and Power It was not difficult for  Curius Fabricius Cincinnatus  or  Emilius Paulus  to content themselves with the narrowest Fortune when it was no obstacle to them in the pursuit of those Honors which their Vertues deserv'd 'Twas in vain to think of bribing a man who sup'd upon the Coleworts of his own Garden He could not be gain'd by Gold who did not think it necessary He that could rise from the Plow to the triumphal Chariot and contentedly return thither again could not be corrupted and he that left the sense of his Poverty to his Executors who found not wherewith to bury him might leave  Macedon  and  Greece  to the pillage of his Soldiers without taking to himself any part of the Booty But when Luxury was brought into fashion and they came to be honor'd who liv'd magnificently tho they had in themselves no qualitys to distinguish them from the basest of Slaves the most vertuous men were expos'd to scorn if they were poor and that poverty which had bin the mother and nurse of their Vertue grew insupportable The Poet well understood what effect this change had upon the World who said  Nullum crimen abest facinusque libidinis ex quo  Paupertas Romana perit  Juven  When Riches grew to be necessary the desire of them which is the spring of all mischief follow'd They who could not obtain Honors by the noblest Actions were oblig'd to get Wealth or purchase them from Whores and Villains who expos'd them to sale and when they were once enter'd into this track they soon learn'd the Vices of those from whom they had receiv'd their Preferment and to delight in the ways that had brought them to it When they were come to this nothing could stop them All thought and remembrance of good was extinguish'd They who had bought the Commands of Armys or Provinces from  Icetus  or  Narcissus  sought only how to draw Mony from them to enable them to purchase higher Dignitys or gain a more assur'd protection from those Patrons This brought the Government of the World under a most infamous Traffick and the Treasures arising from it were for the most part dissipated by worse vices than the Rapine Violence and Fraud with which they had bin gotten The Authors of those Crimes had nothing left but their Crimes and the necessity of committing more thro the indigence into which they were plung'd by the extravagance of their Expences These things are inseparable from the life of a Courtier for as servile Natures are guided rather by sense than reason such as addict themselves to the service of Courts find no other consolation in their misery than what they receive from sensual pleasures or such vanitys as they put a value upon and have no other care than to get Mony for their supply by begging stealing bribing and other infamous practices Their Offices are more or less esteem'd according to the opportunitys they afford for the exercise of these Vertues and no man seeks them for any other end than for gain nor takes any other way than that which conduces to it The usual means of attaining them are by observing the Prince's Humor flattering his Vices serving him in his Pleasures fomenting his Pa  sions and by advancing his worst Designs to create an opinion in him that they love his person and are intirely addicted to his Will When Valor Industry and Wisdom advanc'd men to Offices it was no easy matter for a man to persuade the Senat he had such Qualitys as were requir'd if he had them not But when Princes seek only such as love them and will do what they command 'tis easy to impose upon them and because none that are good will obey them when they command that which is not so they are always encompast by the worst Those who follow them only for Reward are most liberal in professing affection to them and by that means rise to places of Authority and Power The Fountain being thus corrupted nothing that is pure can come from it These mercenary Wretches having the management of Affairs Justice and Honors are set at a price and the most lucrative Traffick in the world is thereby establish'd  Nunc uberiore rapina  Pecc  t in orbe manus  Claud  Eutropius  when he was a Slave us'd to pick Pockets and Locks but being made a Minister he sold Citys Armys and Provinces and some have undertaken to give probable reasons to believe that  Pallas  one of  Claudius  's manumis'd Slaves by these means brought together more Wealth in six years than all the Roman Dictators and Consuls had done from the expulsion of the Kings to their passage into  Asia  The rest walk'd in the same way us'd the same arts and many of them succeeded in the same manner Their Riches consisted not os Spoils taken from Enemys but were the base product of their own corruption They valu'd nothing but Mony and  those who could bribe them were sure to be advanc'd to the highest Offices and whatever they did fear'd no punishment Like Effects will ever proceed from the like Causes When Vanity Luxury and Prodigality are in fashion the desire of Riches must necessarily increase in proportion to them And when the Power is in the hands of base mercenary persons they will always to use the Courtiers phrase make as much profit of their places as they can Not only matters of Favor but of Justice too will be expos'd to sale and no way will be open to Honors or Magistracys but by paying largely for them He that gets an Office by these means will not execute it  gratis  he thinks he may sell what he has bought and would not have enter'd by corrupt ways if he had not intended to deal corruptly Nay if a wellmeaning man should suffer himself to be so far carry'd away by the stream of a prevailing Custom as to purchase Honors of such Villains he would be oblig'd to continue in the same course that he might gain Riches to procure the continuance of his Benefactors protection or to obtain the favor of such as happen to succeed them And the corruption thus beginning in the Head must necessarily diffuse it self into all the Members of the Commonwealth Or if any one which is not to be expected after having bin guilty of one Villany should resolve to commit no more it could have no other effect than to bring him to ruin and he being taken away all things would return to their former channel  Besides this whosoever desires to advance himself must use such means as are sutable to the time in which he lives and the humor of the persons with whom he is to deal It had bin as absurd for any man void of merit to set himself up against  Junius Brutus Cincinnatus Papirius Cursor Camillus Fabius Maximus  or  Scipio  and by bribing the Senat and People of  Rome  think to be chosen Captain against the  Tarquins Tuscans Latins Samnites Gauls  or  Carthaginians  as for the most vertuous men by the most certain proofs of their Wisdom Experience Integrity and Valor to expect advancement from  Caligula Claudius  and  Nero  or the leud Wretches that govern'd them They hated and fear'd all those that excel'd in Vertue and setting themselves to destroy the best for being the best they plac'd the strength of the Government in the hands of the worst which produc'd the effects beforemention'd This seems to have bin so well known that no man pretended to be great at Court but those who had cast off all thoughts of honor and common honesty  Revertar cum Leno Meretrix Scurra Cinaedus ero  said one who saw what manners prevail'd there and wheresoever they do prevail such as will rise must render themselves conformable in all corruption and venality And it may be observ'd that a noble Person now living amongst us who is a great enemy to Bribery was turn'd out from a considerable Office as a scandal to the Court for said the principal Minister he will make no profit of his place and by that means casts a scandal upon those that do  If any man say this is not generally the fate of all Courts I confess it and that if the Prince be just vertuous wise of great Spirit and not pretending to be absolute he may chuse such men as are not mercenary or take such a course as may render it hard for them to deserve Bribes or to preserve themselves from punishment if they should deflect from his intention And a Prince of this Age speaking familiarly with some great Men about him said he had heard much of vast Gains made by those who were near to Princes and ask'd if they made the like one  of them answer'd that they were as willing as others to get something but that no man would give them a farthing for every one finding a free admittance to his Majesty no man needed a Sollicitor And it was no less known that he did of himself grant those things that were just than that none of them had so much credit as to promote such as were not so I will not say such a King is a Phenix perhaps more than one may be found in an Age but they are certainly rare and all that is good in their Government proceeding from the excellency of their personal Vertues it must fail when that Vertue fails which was the root of it Experience shews how little we can rely upon such a help for where Crowns are hereditary Children seldom prove like to their Fathers and such as are elective have also their defects Many seem to be modest and innocent in private Fortunes who prove corrupt and vicious when they are rais'd to Power The violence pride and malice of  Saul  was never discover'd till the People had plac'd him in the Throne But where the Government is Absolute or the Prince endeavours to make it so this integrity can never be found He will always seek such as are content to depend upon his Will which being always unruly good men will never comply ill men will be paid for it and that opens a gap to all manner of corruption Something like to this may befal regular Monarchys or popular Governments They who are plac'd in the principal Offices of trust may be treacherous and when they are so they will always by these means seek to gain Partizans and Dependents upon themselves Their designs being corrupt they must be carry'd on by corruption But such as would support Monarchy in its regularity or popular Governments must oppose it or be destroy'd by it And nothing can better manifest how far Absolute Monarchys are more subject to this venality and corruption than the regular and popular Governments than that they are rooted in the principle of the one which cannot subsist without them and are so contrary to the others that they must certainly perish unless they defend themselves from them  If any man be so far of another opinion as to believe that  Brutus Camillus Scipio Fabius Hannibal Pericles Aristides Agesilaus Epaminondas  or  Pelopidas  were as easily corrupted as  Sejanus Tigellinus Vinnius  or  Laco  That the Senat and People of  Rome Carthage Athens Sparta  or  Thebes  were to be bought at as easy rates as one profligate Villain a Slave an Eunuch or a Whore or tho it was not in former Ages yet it is so now he may be pleas'd to consider by what means men now rise to places of Judicature Churchpreferment or any Offices of trust honor or profit under those Monarchys which we know that either are or would be absolute Let him examin how all the Offices of Justice are now dispos'd in  France  how  Mazarin  came to be advanc'd what traffick he made of Abbys and Bishopricks and what treasures he gain'd by that means Whether the like has not continu'd since his death and as a laudable Example bin transmitted to us since his Majesty's happy restauration Whether Bauds Whores Thieves Buffoons Parasites and such vile wretches as are naturally mercenary have not more Power at  Whitehall Versailles  the Vatican and the Escurial than in  Venice Amsterdam  and  Switzerland  Whether  Hde Arlngtn Dnby  their Graces of  Cleveland  and  Portsmouth Sndrlnd Jenkins  or  Chiffinch  could probably have attain'd such Power as they have had amongst us if it had bin dispos'd by the Suffrages of the Parliament and People Or lastly Whether such as know only how to work upon the personal Vices of a man have more  influence upon one who happens to be born in a reigning Family or upon a Senat consisting of men chosen for their Vertues and Quality or the whole Body of a Nation  But if he who possesses or affects an absolute Power be by his interest led to introduce that corruption which the People Senat and Magistrats who uphold Popular Governments abhor as that which threatens them with destruction if the example arts and means us'd by him and his dependents be of wonderful efficacy towards the introduction of it if nothing but an admirable Vertue which can hardly be in one that enjoys or desires such a Power can divert him from that design and if such Vertue never did nor probably ever will continue long in any one Family we cannot rationally believe there ever was a race of men invested with or possessing such a Power or that there will ever be any who have not and will not endeavour to introduce that corruption which is so necessary for the defence of their Persons and most important Concernments and certainly accomplish their great Design unless they are oppos'd or remov'd  SECT XXVI Civil Tumults and Wars are not the greatest Evils that befal Nations  BƲT skin for skin  says our Author  and all that a man has will he give for his life  And since it was necessary to grace his Book with some Scripturephrases none could be fitter for that purpose than those that were spoken by the Devil but they will be of little use to him For tho I should so far recede from truth as to avow those words to be true I might safely deny the Conclusions he draws from them  That those are the worst Governments under which most men are slain or that more are slain in Popular Governments than in Absolute Monarchys  For having prov'd that all the Wars and Tumults that have happen'd in Commonwealths have never produc'd such slaughters as were brought upon the Empires of  Macedon  and  Rome  or the Kingdoms of  Israel Judah France Spain Scotland  or  England  by Contests between several Competitors for those Crowns if Tumult War and Slaughter be the point in question those are the worst of all Governments where they have bin most frequent and cruel But tho these are terrible Scourges I deny that Government to be simply the worst that has most of them 'Tis ill that men should kill one another in Seditions Tumults and Wars but 'tis worse to bring Nations to such misery weakness and baseness as to have neither strength nor courage to contend for any thing to have nothing left worth defending and to give the name of Peace to desolation I take  Greece  to have bin happy and glorious when it was full of populous Citys flourishing in all the Arts that deserve praise among men When they were courted and fear'd by the greatest Kings and never assaulted by any but to his own loss and confusion When  Babylon  and  Susa  trembled at the motion of their Arms and their valor exercis'd in these Wars and Tumults which our Author looks upon as the greatest Evils was rais'd to such a power that nothing upon Earth was found able to resist them and I think it now miserable when Peace reigns within their  empty walls and the poor remains of those exhausted Nations sheltering themselves under the ruins of the desolated Citys have neither any thing that deserves to be disputed amongst them nor spirit or force to repel the Injurys they daily suffer from a proud and insupportable Master  The like may be said of  Italy  Whilst it was inhabited by Nations governing themselves by their own Will they fell sometimes into domestick Seditions and had frequent Wars with their Neighbors When they were free they lov'd their Country and were always ready to fight in its defence Such as succeeded well increas'd in vigor and power and even those that were the most unfortunate in one Age found means to repair their greatest losses if their Government continu'd Whilst they had a propriety in their goods they would not suffer the Country to be invaded since they knew they could have none if it were lost This gave occasion to Wars and Tumults but it sharpen'd their Courage kept up a good Disciplin and the Nations that were most exercis'd by them always increas'd in power and number so that no Country seems ever to have bin of greater strength than  Italy  was when  Hannibal  invaded it and after his defeat the rest of the World was not able to refist their Valor and Power They sometimes kill'd one another but their Enemys never got any thing but buryingplaces within their Territorys All things are now brought into a very different method by the blessed Governments they are under The fatherly care of the King of  Spain  the Pope and other Princes has establish'd Peace amongst them We have not in many Ages heard of any Sedition among the  Latins Sabins Volsci Equi Samnites  or others The thin halfstarv'd Inhabitants of Walls supported by Ivy sear neither popular Tumults or foreign Alarms and their sleep is only interrupted by Hunger the crys of their Children or the howling of Wolves Instead of many turbulent contentious Citys they have a few scatter'd silent Cottages and the fierceness of those Nations is so temper'd that every rascally Collector of Taxes extorts without fear from every man that which should be the nourishment of his Family And if any of those Countrys are free from that pernicious Vermin 'tis thro the extremity of their Poverty Even in  Rome  a man may be circumvented by the fraud of a Priest or poison'd by one who would have his Estate Wife Whore or Child but nothing is done that looks like Tumult or Violence The Governors do as little fear  Gracchus  as  Hannibal  and instead of wearying their Subjects in Wars they only seek by perverted Laws corrupt Judges false Witnesses and vexatious Suits to cheat them of their Mony and Inheritance This is the best part of their condition Where these Arts are us'd there are men and they have something to lose but for the most part the Lands ly wast and they who were sormerly troubled with the disorders incident to populous Citys now enjoy the quiet and peaceable estate of a Wilderness  Again there is a way of killing worse than that of the Sword for as  Tertullian  says upon a different occasion  prohibere nasci est occidere  those Governments are in the highest degree guilty of Blood which by taking from men the means of living bring some to perish thro want drive others out of the Country and generally dissuade men from marriage by taking from them all ways of subsisting their Familys Notwithstanding all the Seditions of  Florence  and other Citys of  Tuscany  the horrid Factions of  Guelphs  and  Gibelins Neri  and  Bianchi  Nobles and Commons  they continu'd populous strong and exceeding rich but in the space of less than a hundred and fifty years the peaceable Reign of the  Medices  is thought to have destroy'd nine parts in ten of the people of that Province Amongst other things 'tis remarkable that when  Philip  the second of  Spain  gave  Sienna  to the Duke of  Florence  his Embassador then at  Rome  sent him word that he had given away more than six hundred and fifty thousand Subjects and 'tis not believ'd there are now twenty thousand Souls inhabiting that City and Territory  Pisa Pistoia Arezzo Cortona  and other Towns that were then good and populous are in the like proportion diminish'd and  Florence  more than any When that City had bin long troubled with Seditions Tumults and Wars for the most part unprosperous they still retain'd such strength that when  Charles  the eighth of  France  being admitted as a Friend with his whole Army which  Guicciard  soon after conquer'd the Kingdom of  Naples  thought to master them the people taking up Arms struck such a terror into him that he was glad to depart upon such conditions as they thought fit to impose  Machiavel  reports that in that time  Florence  alone with the  Vald' Arno  a small Territory belonging to that City could in a few hours by the sound of a Bell bring together a hundred and thirty five thousand well arm'd men whereas now that City with all the others in that Province are brought to such despicable weakness emptiness poverty and baseness that they can neither resist the oppressions of their own Prince nor defend him or themselves if they were assaulted by a foreign Enemy The People are dispers'd or destroy'd and the best Familys sent to seek Habitations in  Venice Genoa Rome  and  Lucca  This is not the effect of War or Pestilence they enjoy a perfect peace and suffer no other plague than the Government they are under But he who has thus cur'd 'em of Disorders and Tumults dos in my opinion deserve no greater praise than a Physician who should boast there was not a sick person in a house committed to his care when he had poison'd all that were in it The  Spaniards  have establish'd the like peace in the Kingdoms of  Naples  and  Sicily  the  WestIndys  and other places The  Turks  by the same means prevent Tumults in their Dominions And they are of such efficacy in all places that  Mario Chigi  Brother to Pope  Alexander  the seventh by one sordid cheat upon the sale of Corn is said within eight years to have destroy'd above a third part of the people in the Ecclesiastical State and that Country which was the strength of the  Romans  in the time of the  Carthaginian  Wars suffer'd more by the covetousness and fraud of that Villain than by all the defeats receiv'd from  Hannibal  'Twere an endless work to mention all the places where this peaceable solitude has bin introduc'd by absolute Monarchy but Popular and regular Governments have always apply'd themselves to increase the Number Strength Power Riches and Courage of their People by providing comfortable ways of subsistence for their own Citizens inviting Strangers and filling them all with such a love to their Country that every man might look upon the publick Cause as his own and be always ready to defend it This may sometimes give occasion to Tumults and Wars as the most vigorous Bodys may fall into Distempers When every one is solicitous for the Publick there may be difference of opinion and some by mistaking the way may bring prejudice when they intend profit But unless a Tyrant dos arise and destroy the Government which is the root of their felicity or they be overwhelm'd by the irresistible power of a Vertue or Fortune greater than their own they soon recover  and for the most part rise up in greater Glory and Prosperity than before This was seen in the Commonwealths of  Greece  and  Italy  which for this reason were justly called Nurserys of Vertue and their Magistrats Preservers of men whereas our Author's peacemaking Monarchs can deserve no better title than that of Enemys and Destroyers of Mankind  I cannot think him in earnest when he exaggerates  Sylla  's Crueltys as a proof that the mischiefs suffer'd under free States are more universal than under Kings and Tyrants For there never was a Tyrant in the World if he was not one tho thro weariness infirmity of body fear or perhaps the horror of his own wickedness he at length resign'd his Power but the evil had taken root so deep that it could not be remov'd There was nothing of Liberty remaining in  Rome  The Laws were overthrown by the violence of the Sword the remaining Contest was who should be Lord and there is no reason to believe that if  Pompey  had gain'd the Battel of  Pharsalia  he would have made a more modest use of his Victory than  Caesar  did or that  Rome  would have bin more happy under him than under the other His Cause was more plausible because the Senat follow'd him and  Caesar  was the Invader but he was no better in his person and his designs seem to have bin the same He had bin long before  suarum legum auctor eversor  He gave the beginning to the first Triumvirat and 'twere folly to think that he who had bin insolent when he was not come to the highest pitch of Fortune would have prov'd moderate if success had put all into his hands The proceedings of  Marius Cinna Catiline Octavius  and  Antonius  were all of the same nature No Laws were observ'd no publick Good intended the ambition of private persons reign'd and whatsoever was done by them or for their interests can no more be apply'd to Popular Aristocratical or mix'd Governments than the furys of  Caligula  and  Nero  SECT XXVII The Mischiefs and Crueltys proceeding from Tyranny are greater than any that can come from Popular or mix'd Governments  'TIs now time to examin the reasons of our Author's general Maxims  The Crueltys  says he  of a Tyrant extend ordinarily no farther than some particular men that offend him and not to the whole Kingdom It is truly said of his late Majesty King  James  A King can never be so notoriously vicious but he will generally favour Justice and maintain some order Even cruel  Domitian Dionysius  the Tyrant and many others are commended in Historys as great observers of Justice except in particular cases wherein his inordinate lusts may carry him away  It may be said of Popular Governments that tho a People thro error do sometimes hurt a private person and that injury may possibly result to the publick damage because the man that is offended or destroy'd might have bin useful to the Society yet they never do it otherwise than by error For having the Government in themselves whatever is prejudicial to it is so to them and if they ruin it they ruin themselves which no man ever did willingly and knowingly But in absolute Monarchys the matter is quite otherwise A Prince that sets up an interest in himself becomes an Enemy to the Publick in following his own lusts he offends all except a few of his corrupt Creatures  by whose help he oppresses others with a Yoke they are unwilling to bear and thereby incurs the universal hatred This hatred is always proportionable to the injurys receiv'd which being extreme that must be so too and every People being powerful in comparison to the Prince that governs he will always fear those that hate him and always hate those he fears When  Luigi Farnese  first Duke of  Parma  had by his Tyranny incens'd the People of that small City their hatred was not less mortal to him than that of the whole Empire had bin to  Nero  and as the one burnt  Rome  the other would have destroy'd  Parma  if he had not bin prevented The like has bin and will be every where in as much as every man endeavours to destroy those whom he hates and fears and the greatness of the danger often drives this  Cuncta serit dum cuncta timet  Lucan  fear to rage and madness For this reason  Caligula  wish'd but one Neck to all the People and  Nero  triumph'd over the burning City thinking by that ruin he had prevented his own danger I know not who the good Authors are that commend  Domitian  for his Justice but  Tacitus  calls him  Principem virtutibus infestum  Tacit in Vit Agric  and 'tis hard to find out how such a man can be an observer of justice unless it be just that whoever dares to be vertuous under a vicious and base Prince should be destroy'd Another  Cum jam semianimem laceraret Flavius orbem  Tertius calvo serviret Roma Tyranno  Juvenal  Author of the same time speaking of him dos not say he was unjust but gives us reason to think he was so unless it were just for him who had a power over the best part of the World to destroy it and that he who by his cruelty had brought it to the last gasp would have finish'd the work if his rage had not bin extinguish'd  Many Princes not having in themselves power to destroy their People have stir'd up foreign Nations against them and plac'd the only hopes of their safety in the publick Calamity and lawful Kings when they have fall n  nto the first degree of madness so as to assume a power above that which was allow'd by the Law have in fury prov'd equal to the worst Usurpers  Cleonymus  of  Sparta  was of this sort He became says  Plutarch  an Enemy to the City because they would not allow him the absol  e  Plut Vit Pyrrh  Power he affected and brought  Pyrrhus  the fiercest of their Enemys with a mighty and excellently well disciplin'd Army to destroy them  Vortigern  the  Britan  call'd in the  Saxons  with the ruin of his own  Mat Westm  People who were incens'd against him for his Leudness Cruelty and Baseness King  John  for the like reasons offer'd the Kingdom of  England  to the  Moors  and to the Pope  Peter  the Cruel and other Kings of  Castile  brought vast Armys of  Moors  into  Spain  to the ruin of their own People who detested their Vices and would not part with their Privileges Many other examples of the like nature might be alledg'd and I wish our own experience did not too well prove that such designs are common Let him that doubts this examin the Causes of the Wars with  Scotland  in the Years the slaughters of the Protestants in  Ireland  the whole course of Alliances and Treatys for the space of fourscore Years the friendship contracted with the  French  frequent Quarrels with the  Dutch  together with other circumstances that are already made too publick If he be not convinc'd by this he may soon see a man in the Throne who had rather be a Tributary to  France  than a lawful King of  England  whilst either Parliament or People shall dare to dispute his  Commands insist upon their own Rights or defend a Religion inconsistent with that which he has espous'd and then the truth will be so evident as to require no proof  Grotius  was never accus'd of dealing hardly with Kings or laying too much weight upon imaginary cases nevertheless amongst other reasons that in his opinion justify Subjects in taking arms against their Princes he  De Jur Bel  alledges this  propter immanem saevitiam  and  quando Rex in Populi exitium fertur  in as much as it is  contrary to and inconsistent with the ends for which Governments are instituted  which were most impertinent if no such thing could be for that which is not can have no effect There are therefore Princes who seek the destruction of their People or none could be justly oppos'd on that account  If King  James  was of another opinion I could wish the course of his Government had bin suted to it When he said that whilst he had the power of making Judges and Bishops he would make that to be Law and Gospel which best pleas'd him and accordingly fill'd those places with such as turn'd both according to his Will and Interests I must think that by overthrowing Justice which is the rule of civil and moral Actions and perverting the Gospel which is the light of the spiritual man he left nothing unattempted that he durst attempt by which he might bring the most extensive and universal evils upon our Nation that any can suffer This would stand good tho Princes never err'd unless they were  transported with some inordinate Lusts  for 'tis hard to find one that dos not live in the perpetual power of them They are naturally subject to the impulse of such appetites as well as others and whatever evil reigns in their Nature is fomented by Education 'Tis the handle by which their Flatterers lead them and he that discovers to what Vice a Prince is most inclin'd is sure to govern him by rendring himself subservient In this consists the chief art of a Courtier and by this means it comes to pass that such Lusts as in private men are curb'd by fear do not only rage as in a wild Beast but are perpetually inflam'd by the malice of their own Servants their hatred to the Laws of God or Men that might restrain them increases in proportion with their Vices or their fears of being punish'd for them When they are come to this they can set no limits to their sury and there is no extravagance into which they do not frequently fall But many of 'em do not expect these violent motives the perversity of their own nature carrys them to the extremitys of evil They hate Vertue for its own sake and vertuous men for being most unlike to themselves Vertue is the dictate of Reason or the remains of Divine Light by which men are made beneficent and beneficial to each other Religion proceeds from the same spring and tends to the same end and the good of Mankind so intirely depends upon these two that no People ever enjoy'd any thing worth desiring that was not the product of them and whatsoever any have suffer'd that deserves to be abhor'd and fear'd has proceeded either from the defect of these or the wrath of God against them If any Prince therefore has bin an enemy to Vertue and Religion he must also have bin an enemy to Mankind and most especially to the People under him Whatsoever he dos against those that excel in Vertue and Religion tends to the destruction of the People who subsist by them I will not take upon me to define who they are or to tell the number of those that do this but 'tis certain there have bin such and I wish I could say they were few in number or that they had liv'd only in past ages  Tacitus  dos not fix this upon one Prince but  upon all that he writes of and to give his Readers a tast of what he was to write he says  that Nobility and Honors were dangerous but that Vertue  Tacit H  st l  brought most certain destruction  and in another place that  after the slaughter of many excellent men  Nero  resolv'd to cut down Vertue it self and  Annal l  therefore kill'd  Thraseas Paetus  and  Bareas Soranus And whosoever examins the Christian or Ecclesiastical Historys will find those Princes to have bin no less enemys to Vertue and Religion than their Predecessors and consequently enemys to the Nations under them unless Religion and Vertue be things prejudicial or indifferent to Mankind  But our Author may say these were particular cases and so was the slaughter of the Prophets and Apostles the crucifixion of Christ and all the Villanys that have ever bin committed yet they proceeded from a universal principle of hatred to all that is good exerting it self as far as it could to the ruin of mankind And nothing but the overruling Power of God who resolv'd to preserve to himself a People could set bounds to their Rage which in other respects had as full success as our Author or the Devil could have wish'd  Dionysius  his other example of Justice deserves observation More falshood leudness treachery ingratitude cruelty baseness avarice impudence and hatred to all manner of Good was hardly ever known in in a mortal Creature For this reason  Diogenes  seeing him at  Corinth  tho in a poor and contemptible condition said he rather deserv'd to have continu'd in the misery fears and villanys of his Tyranny than to be suffer'd peaceably to converse with honest men And if such as these are to be call'd observers of Justice it must be concluded that the Laws of God and of Men are either of no value or contrary to it and that the destruction of Nations is a better work than their preservation No Faith is to be observ'd Temples may be justly sack'd the best men slain for daring to be better than their Masters and the whole World if it were in the power of one Man rightly torn in pieces and destroy'd  His Reasons for this are as good as his Doctrin  It is  says he  the multitude of people and abundance of riches that are the glory and strength of every Prince the bodys of his Subjects do him service in War and their goods supply his wants Therefore if not out of affection to his people yet out of natural love unto himself every Tyrant desires to preserve the lives and goods of his Subjects  I should have thought that Princes tho Tyrants being God's Vicegerents and Fathers of their People would have sought their good tho no advantage had thereby redounded to themselves but it seems no such thing is to be expected from them They consider Nations as Grasiers do their Herds and Flocks according to the profit that can be made of them and if this be so a People has no more security under a Prince than a Herd or Flock under their Master Tho he desire to be a good Husband yet they must be deliver'd up to the slaughter when he finds a good Market or a better way of improving his Land but they are often foolish riotous prodigal and wantonly destroy their Stock tho to their own prejudice We thought that all Princes and Magistrats had bin set up that under them we might live quietly and peaceably in all godliness and honesty but our Author teaches us that they only seek what they can make of our Bodys and Goods and that they do not live and reign for us but for themselves If this be true they look upon us not as Children but as Beasts nor do us any good for our own sakes or because it is their duty but only that we may be useful to them as Oxen are put into plentiful Pastures that they may be strong for labour  or fit for slaughter This is the divine Model of Government that he offers to the World The just Magistrate is the Minister of God for our good but this Absolute Monarch has no other care of us than as our Riches and Multitude may increase his own Glory and Strength We might easily judg what would be the issue of such a Principle when the Being of Nations depending upon his will must also depend upon his opinion whether the Strength Multitude and Riches of a People do conduce to the increase of Glory and Power or not tho Historys were silent in the case for these things speak of themselves The judgment of a single man is not to be rely'd upon the best and wisest do osten err the foolish and perverse always and our discourse is not of what  Moses  or  Samuel  would do but what may come into the fancy of a furious or wicked man who may usurp the supreme Power or a child a woman or a fool that may inherit it Besides the Proposition upon which he builds his Conclusion proves often false for as the Riches Power Number and Courage of our Friends is for our advantage and that of our Enemys threatens us with ruin those Princes only can reasonably believe the strength of their Subjects beneficial to them who govern so as to be assur'd of their Affection and that their Strength will be imploy'd for them But those who know they are or justly deserve to be hated cannot but think it will be employ'd against them and always seek to diminish that which creates their danger This must certainly befal as many as are leud foolish negligent imprudent cowardly wicked vicious or any way unworthy the places they obtain for their Reign is a perpetual exercise of the most extreme and ruinous Injustice Every man that follows an honest Interest is prejudic'd Every one who finds the Power that was ordain'd for his good to be turn'd to his hurt will be angry and hate him that dos it If the People be of uncorrupted manners this hatred will be universal because every one of them desires that which is just if compos'd of good and evil the first will always be averse to the evil Government and the others endeavouring to uphold it the safety of the Prince must depend upon the prevalence of either Party If the best prove to be the strongest he must perish and knowing himself to be supported only by the worst he will always destroy as many of his Enemys as he can weaken those that remain enrich his Creatures with their Spoils and Confiscations by fraud and rapine accumulate Treasures to increase the number of his Party and advance them into all places of power and trust that by their assistance he may crush his Adversarys and every man is accounted his Adversary who has either Estate Honor Vertue or Reputation This naturally casts all the Power into the hands of those who have no such dangerous qualitys nor any thing to recommend them but an absolute resignation of themselves to do whatever they are commanded These men having neither will nor knowledg to do good as soon as they come to be in power Justice is perverted military Disciplin neglected the publick Treasures exhausted new Projects invented to raise more and the Prince's wants daily increasing thro their ignorance negligence or deceit there is no end of their devices and tricks to gain supplys To this end swarms of Spys Informers and false Witnesses are sent out to circumvent the richest and most eminent men The Tribunals are fill'd with CourtParasites of profligate Consciences Fortunes and Reputation that no man may escape who is brought before them If Crimes are wanting the diligence of well▪chosen Officers and Prosecutors with the favor of the Judges supply all defects the Law is made a  Snare Vertue suppress'd Vice fomented and in a short time Honesty and Knavery Sobriety and Leudness Vertue and Vice become Badges of the several Factions and every man's conversation and manners shewing to what Party he is addicted the Prince who makes himself head of the worst must favour them to the overthrow of the best which is so streight a way to an universal ruin that no State can prevent it unless that course be interrupted  These things consider'd no general Judgment can be made of a Magistrate's Counsels from his Name or Duty He that is just and become grateful to the People by doing good will find his own Honor and Security in increasing their Number Riches Vertue and Power If on the other side by doing evil he has drawn upon himself the publick hatred he will always endeavour to take from them the power of doing him any hurt by bringing them into the utmost weakness poverty and baseness And whoever would know whether any particular Prince desires to increase or destroy the bodys and goods of his Subjects must examin whether his Government be such as renders him grateful or odious to them and whether he dos pursue the publick Interest or for the advancement of his own Authority set up one in himself contrary to that of his People which can never befal a Popular Government and consequently no mischief equal to it can be produc'd by any such unless something can be imagin'd worse than corruption and destruction  SECT XXVIII Men living under Popular or Mix'd Governments are more careful of the publick Good than in Absolute Monarchys  OUR Author delighting in strange things dos in the next place with an admirable sagacity discover two faults in Popular Governments that were never found by any man before him and these are no less than Ignorance and Negligence Speaking of the Care of Princes to preserve their Subjects he adds  On the contrary in a Popular State every man knows the publick Good doth not wholly depend upon his Care but the Commonwealth may be well enough govern'd by others tho he only tend his private business  And a little below  Nor are they much to be blam'd for their Negligence since it is an even wager their Ignorance may be as great The Magistrats amongst the people being for the most part annual do always lay down their Office before they understand it so as a Prince of a duller understanding must needs excel them  This is bravely determin'd and the world is beholden to  Filmer  for the discovery of the Errors that have hitherto bin Epidemical Most men had believ'd that such as live in Free States are usually pleas'd with their condition desire to maintain it and every man finding his own good comprehended in the Publick as those that sail in the same Ship employs the Talent he has in endeavouring to preserve it knowing that he must perish if that miscarry This was an incouragement to Industry and the continual Labors and Dangers to which the  Romans  and other free Nations expos'd themselves have bin taken for Testimonys that they thought themselves concern'd in the businesses that past among them and that every one did not neglect them thro an opinion that they would be done well enough by others It was also thought  that free Citys by frequent Elections of Magistrats became Nurserys of great and able Men every man endeavouring to excel others that he might be advanc'd to the Honor he had no other title to than what might arise from his Merit or Reputation in which they succeeded so well that one of them may be justly said to have produc'd more eminent Men than all the Absolute Monarchys that have bin in the World But these were mistakes Perhaps  Brutus Valerius  and other  Roman  Senators or Magistrats for the space of three hundred years might have taken some care of the Commonwealth if they had thought it wholly depended upon one of them But believing it would be well enough govern'd by others they neglected it  Camillus Cincinnatus Papirius Fabius Rullus  and  Maximus Scipio Africanus Amilcar Hannibal Pericles Themistocles Alcibiades Epaminondas Philopemen  and others might have prov'd able Men in affairs of War or Government but they were remov'd from their Offices before they understood them and must needs be excel'd in both by Princes tho of duller understanding This may be enough to excuse them for performing their Duty so slackly and meanly But 'tis strange that  Tacitus  and others should so far overlook the Reason and so grosly mistake the matter of Fact as not only to say that great and excellent Spirits fail'd when Liberty was lost and all Preferments given to those who were most propense to Slavery but that there wanted men  Tacit Annal l  even to write the History  Inscitia Reipublicae ut alienae  They never apply'd themselves to understand Affairs depending upon the will of one man in whom they were no otherwise concern'd than to avoid the effects of his Rage and that was chiefly to be done by not falling under the suspicion of being vertuous This was the study then in request and the most cunning in this Art were call'd  Scientes temporum  No other wisdom was esteem'd in that and the ensuing Ages and no more was requir'd since the Paternal Care deep Wisdom and profound Judgment of the Princes provided for all and tho they were of duller understandings they must needs excel other Magistrats who having bin created only for a year left their Offices before they could understand the Dutys of them This was evidenc'd by that tenderness and sincerity of heart as well as the great purity of manners observ'd in  Tiberius  the Clemency Justice solid Judgment and Frugality of  Caligula  the Industry Courage and Sobriety of  Claudius  the good Nature and prudent Government of  Nero  the Temperance Vivacity and Diligence of  Vitellius  the Liberality of  Galba  and  Vespasian  together with the Encouragement given by  Domitian Commodus Heliogabalus  and many others to all manner of Vertues and Favors confer'd upon those that excel'd in them Ou  Author giving such infallible proof of his Integrity and Understanding by teaching us these things that would never have come into our heads ought surely to be credited tho that which he proposes seems to be most absurd But if we believe such as liv'd in those times or those who in later ages have perus'd their Writings we cannot but think the Princes beforemention'd and the greatest part of those who possest the same places not only to have bin void of all Vertue and to have suffer'd none to grow up under them but in baseness sottishness and malice to have bin equal to the worst of all Beasts Whilst one Prince polluted with  ust and Blood sat in his  Grotto  at  Capreae  surrounded with an infamous Troop of Astrologers and others were govern'd by Whores Bardache's manumis'd Slaves and other Villains the Empire was ruin'd thro their negligence incapacity and wickedness and the City that  had flourish'd in all manner of Vertue as much or more than any that has bin yet known in the world produc'd no more the Disciplin was dissolv'd that nourish'd it no man could hope to advance a publick Good or obviate an Evil by his diligence and valor and he who acquir'd reputation by either could expect no other reward than a cruel death If  Germanicus  and  Corbulo  who were born when Liberty was expiring be brought for Examples against the first part of my Assertion their ends will justify the latter and no eminent  Roman  Family is known to have brought forth a man that deserv'd to be nam'd in History since their time This is as probable in reason as true in fact Men are valiant and industrious when they fight for themselves and their Country they prove excellent in all the Arts of War and Peace when they are bred up in vertuous Exercises and taught by their Fathers and Masters to rejoice in the Honors gain'd by them they love their Country when the good of every particular man is comprehended in the publick Prosperity and the success of their Atchievements is improv'd to the general advantage They undertake hazards and labors for the Government when 'tis justly administer'd when Innocence is safe and Vertue honour'd when no man is distinguish'd from the vulgar but such as have distinguish'd themselves by the bravery of their actions when no honor is thought too great for those who do it eminently unless it be such as cannot be communicated to others of equal merit They do not spare their Persons Purses or Friends when the publick Powers are employ'd for the publick Benefit and imprint the like affections in their Children from their Infancy The disciplin of Obedience in which the  Romans  were bred taught them to command and few were admitted to the Magistracys of inferior rank till they had given such proof of their Vertue as might deserve the Supreme  Cincinnatus Camillus Papirius Mamercus Fabius Maximus  were not made Dictators that they might learn the Dutys of the Office but because they were judg'd to be of such Wisdom Valor Integrity and Experience that they might be safely trusted with the highest Powers and whilst the Law reign'd not one was advanc'd to that honor who did not fully answer what was expected from him By this means the City was so replenish'd with men fit for the greatest employments that even in its infancy when three hundred and six of the  Fabii Quorum neminem  says  Livy ducem sperneret quibuslibet temporibus Senatus  were kill'd in one day the City did lament the loss but was not so weaken'd to give any advantage to their Enemys and when every one of those who had bin eminent before the second Punic War  Fabius Maximus  only excepted had perish'd in it others arose in their places who surpast them in number and were equal to them in Vertue The City was a perpetual spring of such men as long as Liberty lasted but that was no sooner overthrown than Vertue was torn up by the roots the People became base and sordid the small remains of the Nobility slothsul and effeminate and their  Italian  Associats becoming like to them the Empire whilst it stood was only sustain'd by the strength os Foreigners  The  Grecian  Vertue had the same fate and expir'd with Liberty instead of such Soldiers as in their time had no equals and such Generals of Armys and Fleets Legislators and Governors as all succeeding Ages have justly admir'd they sent out swarms of Fidlers Jesters Chariotdrivers Players Bawds Flatterers Ministers of the most impure Lusts or idle babling hypocritical Philosophers not much better than they The Emperors Courts were always crouded with this Vermin and notwithstanding  the necessity our Author imagins that Princes must needs understand matters of Government better than Magistrats annually chosen they did for the most part prove so brutish as to give themselves and the World to be govern'd by such as these and that without any great prejudice since none could be found more ignorant leud and base than themselves  'Tis absurd to impute this to the change of times for time changes nothing and nothing was chang'd in those times but the Government and that chang'd all things This is not accidental but according to the rules given to Nature by God imposing upon all things a necessity of perpetually following their Causes Fruits are always of the same nature with the Seeds and Roots from which they come and Trees are known by the fruits they bear As a Man begets a Man and a Beast a Beast that Society of Men which constitutes a Government upon the foundation of Justice Vertue and the common Good will always have men to promote those ends and that which intends the advancement of one man's desires and vanity will abound in those that will foment them Men follow that which seems advantageous to themselves Such as are bred under a good disciplin and see that all benefits procur'd to their Country by vertuous Actions redound to the honor and advantage of themselves their Children Friends and Relations contract from their infancy a love to the Publick and look upon the common Concernments as their own When they have learnt to be vertuous and see that Vertue is in esteem they seek no other preferments than such as may be obtain'd that way and no Country ever wanted great numbers of excellent men where this method was establish'd On the other side when 'tis evident that the best are despis'd hated or mark'd out for destruction all things calculated to the humor or advantage of one man who is often the worst or govern'd by the worst Honors Riches Commands and Dignitys dispos'd by his Will and his favor gain'd only by a most obsequious respect or a pretended affection to his person together with a servile obedience to his commands all Applications to vertuous Actions will cease and no man caring to render himself or his Children worthy of great Imployments such as desire to have them will by little intrigues corruption scurrility and flattery endeavour to make way to them by which means true Merit in a short time comes to be abolish'd as fell out in  Rome  as soon as the  Caesars  began to reign  He who dos not believe this may see whether the like did not happen in all the other Commonwealths of  Italy  and  Greece  or if modern examples are thought to be of more value let him examin whether the Noblemen of  Venice  who are born and bred in Familys that never knew a Master who act for themselves and have a part in all the good or evil that befals the Commonwealth and know that if it be destroy'd the  must perish or at least that all changes are to their prejudice do neglect the publick Interests as thinking that the whole not depending upon any one of them things will be well enough govern'd tho they attend only their private benefit Let it be observ'd whether they do better understand the common concernments than the great men of  France  or  Spain  who never come to the knowledg of any thing unless they happen to be favor'd by the King or his Ministers and know themselves never to be more miserable than when their Master is most prosperous For my own part I cannot think it necessary to alledg any other proo  of this point than that when  Maximilian  the Emperor  Lewis  the twelfth of  France  the fierce Pope  Julius  the second and  Ferdinand  the subtil and powerful King of  Spain  had by the League of  Cambray  combin'd against the  Venetians  gain'd the Battel of  La Ghirad'adda  taken  Alviano  their  Paol Paruta Hist Venet Guicciard  General prisoner depriv'd them of all their Dominion on the  Terra firma  and prepar'd to assault the City it was under God solely preserv'd by the vigor and wisdom of their Nobility who tho no way educated to War unless by Sea sparing neither persons nor purses did with admirable industry and courage first recover  Padoüa  and then many other Citys  o as at the end of that terrible War they came off without any diminution of their Territorys Whereas  Portugal  having in our age revolted from the House of  Austria  no one doubts that it had bin immediately reduc'd if the great men of  Spain  had not bin pleas'd with such a lessening of their Master's power and resolv'd not to repair it by the recovery of that Kingdom or to deprive themselves of an easy retreat when they should be opprest by him or his Favorites The like thought was more plainly exprest by the Mareschal  de Bassompierre  who seeing how hardly  Rochel  was prest by  Lewis  the  th  said  Je croy qu'enfin Nous serons assez fous pour prendre la Rochelle Mem de Bassom  ierre  he thought they should be such fools to take it  but 'tis believ'd they would never have bin such fools and the treachery only of our Countrymen did enable the Cardinal  Richlieu  to do it as for his own Glory and the advancement of the Popish Cause he really intended and nothing is to this day more common in the mouths of their wisest and best men tho Papists than the acknowledgment of their own folly in suffering that place to fall the King having by that means gotten power to proceed against them at his pleasure The brave Monsieur  de Turenne  is said to have carry'd this to a greater height in his last Discourse to the present King of  France  "You think said he you have Armys but you have none the one half of the Officers are the Bawdyhouse Companions of Monsieur  de xxx  or the Creatures of his Whore Madam  de xxx  the other half may be men of experience and fit for their Imployments but they are such as would be pleas'd with nothing more than to see you lose two or three Battels that coming to stand in need of them you might cause them to be better us'd by your Ministers than of late they have bin"  It may easily be imagin'd how men in such sentiments do serve their Master and nothing is more evident than that the  French  in this age have had so great advantages that they might have brought  Europe  and perhaps  Asia  under their power if the interest of the Nation had bin united to that of the Government and the Strength Vigor and Bravery of the Nobility employ'd that way But since it has pleas'd God to suffer us to fall into a condition of being little able to help our selves and that they are in so good terms with the  Turk  as not to attack him 'tis our happiness that they do not know their own strength or cannot without ruin to themselves turn it to our prejudice  I could give yet more pregnant testimonys of the difference between men fighting for their own interests in the Offices to which they had bin advanc'd by the votes of numerous Assemblys and such as serve for pay and get preferments by corruption or favor if I were not unwilling to stir the spleen of some men by obliging them to reflect upon what has past in our own Age and Country to compare the Justice of our Tribunals within the time of our memory and the integrity of those who for a while manag'd the publick Treasure the Disciplin Valor and Strength  of our Armys and Fleets the increase of our Riches and Trade the success of our Wars in  Scotland Ireland  and at Sea the glory and reputation not long since gain'd with that condition into which we are of late fallen But I think I shall offend no wise or good man if I say that as neither the  Romans  nor  Grecians  in the time of their Liberty ever perform'd any actions more glorious than freeing the Country from a Civil War that had rag'd in every part the conquest of two such Kingdoms as  Scotland  and  Ireland  and crushing the formidable power of the  Hollanders  by Sea nor ever produc'd more examples of Valor Industry Integrity and in all respects compleat disinterested unmoveable and incorruptible Vertue than were at that time seen in our Nation So neither of them upon the change of their Affairs did exceed us in weakness cowardice baseness venality leudness and all manner of corruption We have reason therefore not only to believe that all Princes do not necessarily understand the affairs of their People or provide better for them than those who are otherwise chosen but that as there is nothing of Greatness Power Riches Strength and Happiness which we might not reasonably have hop'd for if we had rightly improv'd the advantages we had so there is nothing of shame and misery which we may not justly fear since we have neglected them  If any man think that this evil of advancing Officers for personal respects favor or corruption is not of great extent I desire him to consider that the Officers of State Courts of Justice Church Armys Fleets and Corporations are of such number and power as wholly to corrupt a Nation when they themselves are corrupted and will ever be corrupt when they attain to their Offices by corruption The good management of all Affairs Civil Military and Ecclesiastical necessarily depends upon good order and disciplin and 'tis not in the power of common men to reform abuses patroniz'd by those in Authority nor to prevent the mischiefs thereupon ensuing and not having power to direct publick actions to the publick good they must consequently want the industry and affection that is requir'd to bring them to a good issue The  Romans  were easily beaten under the  Decemviri  tho immediately before the erection and after the extinction of that Power none of their Neighbours were able to resist them The  Goths  who with much Glory had reign'd in  Spain  for about three hundred years had neither strength nor courage under their leud and odious King  Rodrigo  and were in one day subdu'd with little loss of blood by the  Saracens  and could not in less than eight hundred years free their Country from them That brave Nation having of late fallen under as base a conduct has now as little heart or power to defend it self CourtParasites have render'd Valor ridiculous and they who have ever shew'd themselves as much inclin'd to Arms as any people of the world do now abhor them and are sent to the Wars by force laid in Carts bound like Calves brought to the Shambles and left to starve in  Flanders  as soon as they arrive It may easily be judg'd what service can be expected from such men tho they should happen to be well commanded but the great Officers by the corruption of the Court think only of enriching themselves and encreasing the misery of the Soldiers by their frauds both become equally useless to the State  Notwithstanding the seeming prosperity of  France  matters there are not much better manag'd The warlike temper of that people is so worn out by the frauds and crueltys of corrupt Officers that few men list themselves willingly to be Soldiers and when they are engag'd or forc'd they  are so little able to endure the miserys to which they are expos'd that they daily run away from their Colors tho they know not whither to go and expect no mercy if they are taken The King has in vain attempted to correct this humor by the severity of martial Law but mens minds will not be forc'd and tho his Troops are perfectly well arm'd cloth'd and exercis'd they have given many testimonys of little worth When the Prince of  Condé  had by his own Valor and the Strength of the King's Guards broken the first line of the Prince of  Orange  's Army at the battel of  Seneff  he could not make the second and third line of his own Army to advance and reinforce the first by which means he lost all the fair hopes he had conceiv'd of an intire Victory Not long after the Mareschal  de Crequi  was abandon'd by his whole Army near  Trier  who ran away hardly striking a stroke and left him with sixteen horse to shift for himself When  Monsieur de Turenne  by the excellency of his Conduct and Valor had gain'd such a Reputation amongst the Soldiers that they thought themselves secure under him he did not suffer such disgraces but he being kill'd they return'd to the usual temper of forc'd and illus'd Soldiers half the Army was lost in a retreat little differing from a flight and the rest as they themselves confess sav'd by the bravery of two  English  Regiments The Prince of  Condé  was soon after sent to command but he could not with all his courage skill and reputation raise their fallen Spirits nor preserve his Army any other way than by lodging them in a Camp near  Schlestadt  so fortify'd by Art and Nature that it could not be forc'd  To these we may add some Examples of our own In our late War the  Scots  Foot whether Friends or Enemys were much inferior to those of the Parliament and their Horse esteem'd as nothing Yet in the year and the King's Army tho very numerous excellently arm'd and mounted and in appearance able to conquer many such Kingdoms as  Scotland  being under the conduct of Courtiers and affected as men usually are towards those that use them ill and seek to destroy them they could never resist a wretched Army commanded by  Leven  but were shamefully beaten at  Newborn  and left the Northern Countys to be ravag'd by them  When  Van Tromp  set upon  Blake  in  FolestonBay  the Parliament had not above thirteen Ships against threescore and not a man that had ever seen any other fight at Sea than between a Merchantship and a Pirat to oppose the best Captain in the world attended with many others in valor and experience not much inserior to him Many other difficultys were observ'd in the unsetled State Few Ships want of Mony several Factions and some who to advance particular Interests betray'd the Publick But such was the power of Wisdom and Integrity in those that sat at the Helm and their diligence in chusing men only for their Merit was blest with such success that in two years our Fleets grew to be as famous as our Land Armys the Reputation and Power of our Nation rose to a greater height than when we possest the better half of  France  and the Kings of  France  and  Scotland  were our Prisoners All the States Kings and Potentates of  Europe  most respectfully not to say submissively sought our Friendship and  Rome  was more afraid of  Blake  and his Fleet than they had bin of the great King of  Sweden  when he was ready to invade  Italy  with a hundred thousand men This was the work of those who if our Author says true  thought basely of the publick Concernments  and believing things might be well enough manag'd by others minded only  their private Affairs These were the effects of the negligence and ignorance of those who being suddenly advanc'd to Offices were remov'd before they understood the Dutys of them These Diseases which proceed from popular corruption and irregularity were certainly cur'd by the restitution of that Integrity good Order and Stability that accompany divine Monarchy The Justice of the War made against  Holland  in the year the probity of the Gentleman who without partiality or bribery chose the most part of the Officers that carry'd it on the Wisdom Diligence and Valor manifested in the conduct and the Glory with which it was ended justifys all that our Author can say in its commendation If any doubt remains the subtilty of making the King of  France  desire that the  Netherlands  might be an accession to his Crown the ingenious ways taken by us to facilitate the conquest of them the Industry of our Embassadors in diverting the  Spaniards  from entring into the War till it was too late to recover the Losses sustain'd the honourable Design upon the  Smyrna  Fleet and our frankness in taking the quarrel upon our selves together with the important Figure we now make in  Europe  may wholly remove it and in confirmation of our Author's Doctrin shew that Princes do better perform the Offices that require Wisdom Industry and Valor than annual Magistrats and do more seldom err in the choice of Officers than Senats and popular Assemblys  SECT XXIX There is no assurance that the Distempers of a State shall be cur'd by the Wisdom of a Prince  BƲT  says our Author  the Vertue and Wisdom of a Prince supplys all Tho he were of a duller understanding by use and experience he must needs excel all  Nature Age or Sex are as it seems nothing to the case A Child as soon as he comes to be a King has experience the head of a Fool is fill'd with Wisdom as soon as a Crown is set upon it and the most vicious do in a moment become vertuous This is more strange than that an Ass being train'd to a Course should outrun the best  Arabian  Horse or a Hare bred up in an Army become more strong and fierce than a Lion for Fortune dos not only supply all natural defects in Princes and correct their vices but gives them the benefit of use and experience when they have none Some Reasons and Examples might have bin expected to prove this extraordinary Proposition But according to his laudable custom he is pleas'd to trouble himself with neither and thinks that the impudence of an Assertion is sufficient to make that to pass which is repugnant to experience and common sense as may appear by the following discourse  I will not insist upon terms for tho  duller understanding  signisys nothing in as much as no understanding is dull and a man is said to be dull only because he wants it but presuming he means little understanding I shall so take it This defect may possibly be repair'd in time but to conclude it must be so is absurd for no one has this use and experience when he begins to reign At that  ime many Errors may be committed to the ruin of himself or people and many have perish'd even in their beginning  Edward  the fifth and sixth of  England Francis  the second of  France  and divers other Kings have dy'd in the beginning of their youth  Charles  the ninth liv'd only to add the furys of youth to the follys of his childhood and our  Henry  the second  Edward  the second  Richard  the second and  Henry  the sixth seem to have bin little wiser in the last than in the first year of their Reign or Life The present Kings of  Spain France  and  Sweden  came to the Crowns they wear before the sixth year of their Age and if they did then surpass all annual Magistrats in Wisdom and Valor it was by a peculiar Gift of God which for any thing we know is not given to every King and it was not Use and Experience that made them to excel If it be pretended that this Experience with the Wisdom that it gives comes in time and by degrees I may modestly ask what time is requir'd to render a Prince excellent in Wisdom who is a Child or a Fool and who will give security that he shall live to that time or that the Kingdom shall not be ruin'd in the time of his folly I may also doubt how our Author who concludes that every King in time must needs become excellent in Wisdom can be reconcil'd to  Solomon  who in preferring a wise Child before an old and foolish King that will not be advis'd shews that an old King may be a Fool and he that will not be advis'd is one Some are so naturally brutish and stupid that neither education nor time will mend them 'Tis probable that  Solomon  took what care he could to instruct his only Son  Rehoboam  but he was certainly a Fool at forty years of age and we have no reason to believe that he deserv'd a better name He seems to have bin the very Fool his Father intended who tho bray'd in a mortar would never leave his folly He would not be advis'd tho the hand of God was against him ten Tribes revolted from him and the City and Temple was pillag'd by the  Egyptians  Neither experience nor afflictions could mend him and he is call'd to this day by his own Countrymen  Stultitia Gentium  I might offend tender ears if I should alledg all the Examples of Princes mention'd in History or known in our own Age who have liv'd and dy'd as foolish and incorrigible as he but no man I presume will be scandaliz'd if I say that the ten last Kings of  Meroveus  his Race whom the  French  Historians call  Les Roys faineants  were so far from excelling other men in understanding that they liv'd and dy'd more like beasts than men Nay the Wisdom and Valor of  Charles Martel  expir'd in his Grandchild  Charles  the Great and his Posterity grew to be so sottish that the  French  Nation must have perish'd under their conduct if the Nobility and People had not rejected them and plac'd the Crown upon a more deserving Head  This is as much as is necessary to be said to the general Proposition for it is false if it be not always true and no conclusion can be made upon it But I need not be so strict with our Author there being no one fou d part in his Assertion Many Children come to be Kings when they h  e no experience and die or are depos'd before they can gain any Many are by nature so sottish that they can learn nothing Others falling under the power of Women or corrupt Favorites and Ministers are persuaded and seduc'd from the good ways to which their own natural understanding or experience might lead them the Evils drawn upon themselves or their Subjects by the Errors committed in the time of their ignorance are o  ten grievous and sometimes irreparable tho they should be made wise by time and experience A person of royal Birth and excellent Wit was so sensible of this as to tell me  "That the condition of Kings was most miserable in as much as they never heard Truth till  they were ruin'd by Lies and then every one was ready to tell it to them not by way of advice but reproach and rather to vent their own spite than to seek a remedy to the evils brought upon them and the people"  Others attain to Crowns when they are of full Age and have experience as Men tho none as Kings and therefore are apt to commit as great mistakes as Children And upon the whole matter all the Historys of the world shew that instead of this profound Judgment and incomparable Wisdom which our Author generally attributes to all Kings there is no sort of men that do more frequently and intirely want it  But tho Kings were always wise by nature or made to be so by experience it would be of little advantage to Nations under them unless their Wisdom were pure perfect and acompany'd with Clemency Magnanimity Justice Valor and Piety Our Author himself durst hardly have said that these Vertues or Graces are gain'd by Experience or annex'd by God to any rank of Men or Familys He gives them where he pleases without distinction We sometimes see those upon Thrones who by God and Nature seem to have bin design'd for the most sordid Offices and those have bin known to pass their lives in meanness and poverty who had all the Qualitys that could be desir'd in Princes There is likewise a kind of ability to dispatch some sort of Affairs that Princes who continue long in a Throne may to a degree acquire or increase Some men take this for Wisdom but K  James  more rightly call'd it by the name of  Kingcraft  and as it principally consists in Dissimulation and the arts of working upon mens Passions Vanitys private Interests or Vices to make them for the most part instruments of Mischief it has the advancement or security of their own Persons for its object is frequently exercis'd with all the excesses of Pride Avarice Treachery and Cruelty and no men have bin ever found more notoriously to deflect from all that deserves praise in a Prince or a Gentleman than those that have most excel'd in  Tacit An l  it  Pharasmenes  King of  Iberia  is recorded by  Tacitus  to have bin well vers'd in this Science His Brother  Mithradates  King of  Armenia  had marry'd his Daughter and given his own Daughter to  Rhadamistus  Son of  Pharasmenes  He had some Contests with  Mithradates  but by the help of these mutual Alliances nearness of Blood the diligence of  Rhadamistus  and an Oath strengthen'd with all the Ceremonys that amongst those Nations were esteem'd most sacred not to use Arms or Poison against him all was compos'd and by this means getting him into his power he stifled him with a great weight of clothes thrown upon him kill'd his Children and not long after his own Son  Rhadamistus  also  Louis  the eleventh of  France James  the third of  Scotland Henry  the seventh of  England  were great Masters of these Arts and t  ose who are acquainted with History will easily judg how happy Nations would be if all Kings did in time certainly learn them  Our Author as a farther testimony of his Judgment having said that Kings must needs excel others in Understanding and grounded his Doctrin upon their profound Wisdom imputes to them those  base and panick sears  which are inconsistent with it or any royal Vertue and to carry the point higher tells us  There is no Tyrant so barbarously wicked but his own reason and sense will tell him that tho he be a God yet he must die like a Man and that there is not the meanest of his Subjects but may find a means to revenge himself of the Injurys offer'd him  and from thence concludes that  there is no such Tyranny as that of a Multitude which is subject to no  sach fears  But if there be such a thing in the World as a barbarous and wicked Tyrant he is something different from a King or the same and his Wisdom is consistent or inconsistent with Barbarity Wickedness and Tyranny If there be no difference the praises he gives and the rights he ascribes to the one belong also to the other and the excellency of Wisdom may consist with Barbarity Wickedness Tyranny and the panick fears that accompany them which hitherto have bin thought to comprehend the utmost excesses of Folly and Madness and I know no better testimony of the truth of that Opinion than that Wisdom always distinguishing good from evil and being seen only in the rectitude of that distinction in following and adhering to the good rejecting that which is evil preferring safety before danger happiness before misery and in knowing rightly how to use the means of attaining or preserving the one and preventing or avoiding the other there cannot be a more extravagant deviation from Reason than for a man who in a private condition might live safely and happily to invade a Principality or if he be a Prince who by governing with Justice and Clemency might obtain the inward satisfaction of his own Mind hope for the blessing of God upon his just and vertuous Actions acquire the love and praises of men and live in safety and happiness amongst his safe and happy Subjects to fall into that Barbarity Wickedness and Tyranny which brings upon him the displeasure of God and detestation of men and which is always attended with those base and panick fears that comprehend all that is shameful and miserable This being perceiv'd by  Machiavel  he could not think  Discors sopra T Liv l c  that any man in his senses would not rather be a  Scipio  than a  Cesar  or if he came to be a Prince would not rather chuse to imitate  Agesilaus Timoleon  or  Dion  than  Nabis Phalaris  or  Dionysius  and imputes the contrary choice to madness Nevertheless 'tis too well known that many of our Author's profound wise men in the depth of their Judgment made perfect by use and experience have fallen into it  If there be a difference between this barbarous wicked Tyrant and a King we are to examin who is the Tyrant and who the King for the name confer'd or assum'd cannot make a King unless he be one He who is not a King can have no Title to the rights belonging to him who is truly a King so that a People who find themselves wickedly and barbarously opprest by a Tyrant may destroy him and his Tyranny without giving offence to any King  But 'tis strange that  Filmer  should speak of the Barbarity and Wickedness of a Tyrant who looks upon the World to be the Patrimony of one man and for the foundation of his Doctrin asserts such a power in every one that makes himself master of any part as cannot be limited by any Law His Title is not to be question'd Usurpation and Violence confer an incontestable Right the exercise of his Power is no more to be disputed than the Acquisition his will is a Law to his Subjects and no Law can be impos'd by them upon his Conduct For if these things be true I know not how any man could ever be call'd a Tyrant that name having never bin given to any unless for usurping a Power that did not belong to him or an unjust exercise of that which had bin confer'd upon him and violating the Laws which ought to be a rule to him 'Tis also hard to imagin how any man can be call'd barbarous and wicked if he be oblig'd by no Law but that of his own Pleasure for we have no other notion of wrong than that it is a breach of the Law which determins what is right If the lives and goods of Subjects depend upon the Will  of the Prince and he in his profound Wisdom preserve them only to be beneficial to himself they can have no other right than what he gives and without injustice may retain when he thinks fit If there be no wrong there can be no just revenge and he that pretends to seek it is not a free man vindicating his Right but a perverse slave rising up against his Master But if there be such a thing as a barbarous and wicked Tyrant there must be a rule relating to the acquisition and exercise of the Power by which he may be distinguish'd from a just King and a Law superior to his Will by the violation of which he becomes barbarous and wicked  Tho our Author so sar forgets himself to confess this to be true he seeks to destroy the fruits of it by such flattery as comprehends all that is most detestable in Profaneness and Blasphemy and gives the name of Gods to the most execrable of men He may by such language deserve the name of  Heylin  's Disciple but will find few among the Heathens so basely servile or so boldly impious Tho  Claudius Cesar  was a drunken sot and transported with the extravagance of his Fortune he detested the impudence of his Predecessor  Caligula  who affected that Title and in his Rescript to the Procurator of  Judea  gives it no better name than  turpem Caii insaniam  For this reason it was rejected by all his Pagan Successors who were not as furiously wicked as he yet  Filmer  has thought fit to renew it for the benefit of Mankind and the Glory of the Christian Religion  I know not whether these extreme and barbarous Errors of our Author are to be imputed to wickedness or madness or whether to save the pains of a distinction they may not rightly be said to be the same thing but nothing less than the excess of both could induce him to attribute any thing of good to the fears of a Tyrant since they are the chief causes of all the mischiefs he dos  Tertullian  says they are  Metu quam furore saeviores  and  Tacitus  speaking of a most wicked King says that he did  Saevitiam ignaviae obtendere  and we do not more certainly find that Cowards are the cruellest of men than that wickedness makes them Cowards that every man's fears bear a proportion with his guilt and with the number vertue and strength of those he has offended He who usurps a power over all or abuses a Trust repos'd in him by all in the highest measure offends all he fears and hates those he has offended and to secure himself aggravates the former Injurys When these are publick they beget a universal Hatred and every man desires to extinguish a Mischief that threatens ruin to all This will always be terrible to one that knows he has deserv'd it and when those he dreads are the body of the People nothing but a publick destruction can satisfy his rage and appease his fears  I wish I could agree with  Filmer  in exempting multitudes from fears for they having seldom committed any injustice unless thro fear would as far as human fragility permits be free from it Tho the  Attick Ostracism  was not an extreme Punishment I know nothing usually practis'd in any Commonwealth that did so much savor of injustice but it proceeded solely from a fear that one man tho in appearance vertuous when he came to be rais'd too much above his fellowCitizens might be tempted to invade the publick Liberty We do not find that the  Athenians  or any other free Citys ever injur'd any man unless thro such a jealousy or the perjury of Witnesses by which the best Tribunals that ever were or can be establish'd in the world may be misled and no injustice could  be apprehended from any if they did not fall into such fears  But tho Multitudes may have fears as well as Tyrants the Causes and Effects of them are very different A People in relation to domestick Affairs can desire nothing but Liberty and neither hate or fear any but such as do or would as they suspect deprive them of that Happiness Their endeavors to secure that seldom hurt any except such as invade their Rights and if they err the mistake is for the most part discover'd before it produce any mischief and the greatest that ever came that way was the death of one or a few men Their Hatred and desire of Revenge can go no farther than the sense of the Injury receiv'd or fear'd and is extinguish'd by the death or banishment of the Persons as may be gather'd from the examples of the  Tarquins Decemviri Cassius Melius  and  Manlius Capitolinus  He therefore that would know whether the hatred and fear of a Tyrant or of a People produces the greater mischiefs needs only to consider whether it be better that the Tyrant destroy the People or that the People destroy the Tyrant or at the worst whether one that is suspected of affecting the Tyranny should perish or a whole People amongst whom very many are certainly innocent and experience shows that such are always first sought out to be destroy'd for being so Popular furys or fears how irregular or unjust soever they may be can extend no farther general Calamitys can only be brought upon a People by those who are enemys to the whole Body which can never be the Multitude for they are that Body In all other respects the fears that render a Tyrant cruel render a People gentle and cautious for every single man knowing himself to be of little power not only fears to do injustice because it may be reveng'd upon his Person by him or his Friends Kindred and Relations that suffers it but because it tends to the overthrow of the Government which comprehends all publick and private Concernments and which every man knows cannot subsist unless it be so easy and gentle as to be pleasing to those who are the best and have the greatest power and as the publick Considerations divert them from doing those Injurys that may bring immediate prejudice to the Publick so there are strict Laws to restrain all such as would do private Injurys If neither the People nor the Magistrats of  Venice Switzerland  and  Holland  commit such extravagances as are usual in other places it dos not perhaps proceed from the temper of those Nations different from others but from a knowledg that whosoever offers an injury to a private person or attempts a publick mischief is expos'd to the impartial and inexorable Power of the Law whereas the chief work of an absolute Monarch is to place himself above the Law and thereby rendring himself the Author of all the evils that the People suffer 'tis absurd to expect that he should remove them  SECT XXX A Monarchy cannot be well regulated unless the Powers of the Monarch are limited by Law  OUR Author's next step is not only to reject Popular Governments but all such Monarchys as are not absolute  for if the King  says he  admits the People to be his Companions he leaves to be a King  This  is the language of  French  Lackeys Valet de Chambre's Taylors and others like them in Wisdom Learning and Policy who when they fly to  England  for fear of a well deserv'd Gally Gibbet or Wheel are ready to say  Il faut que le Roy soit absolu autrement il n'est point Roy  And finding no better men to agree with  Filmer  in this sublime Philosophy I may be pardon'd if I do not follow them till I am convinc'd in these ensuing points  It seems absurd to speak of Kings admitting the Nobility or People to part of the Government for tho there may be and are Nations without Kings yet no man can conceive a King without a People These must necessarily have all the power originally in themselves and tho Kings may and often have a power of granting Honors Immunitys and Privileges to private Men or Corporations he dos it only out of the publick Stock which he is entrusted to distribute but can give nothing to the People who give to him all that he can rightly have  'Tis strange that he who frequently cites  Aristotle  and  Plato  should unluckily acknowledg such only to be Kings as they call Tyrants and deny the name of King to those who in their opinion are the only Kings  I cannot understand why the Scripture should call those Kings whose Powers were limited if they only are Kings who are absolute  Deut  or why  Moses  did appoint that the power of Kings in  Israel  should be limited if they resolv'd to have them if that limitation destroy'd the being of a King  And lastly how he knows that in the Kingdoms which have a shew of Popularity the Power is wholly in the King  The first point was prov'd when we examin'd the beginning of Monarchys and found it impossible that there could be any thing of justice in them unless they were establish'd by the common consent of those who were to live under them or that they could make any such establishment unless the right and power were in them  Secondly Neither  Plato  nor  Aristotle  acknowledg either reason or justice in the power of a Monarch unless he has more of the Vertues conducing to the good of the Civil Society than all those who compose it and employ them for the publick advantage and not to his own pleasure and profit as being set up by those who seek their own good for no other reason than that he should procure it To this end a Law is set as a rule to him and the best men that is such as are most like to himself  Plat de Leg Arist Polit  made to be his Assistants because say they  Lex est mens sine affectu quasi Deus  whereas the best of men have their affections and passions and are subject to be misled by them Which shews that as the Monarch is not for himself nor by himself he dos not give but receive power nor admit others to the participation of it but is by them admitted to what he has Whereupon they conclude that to prefer the absolute power of a man as in those Governments which they call  Barbarorum regna  before the regular Government of Kings justly exercising a power instituted by Law and directed to the publick good is to chuse rather to be subject to the lust of a Beast than to be govern'd by a God And because such a choice can only be made by a Beast I leave our Author to find a description of himself in their Books which he so often cites  But if  Aristotle  deserves credit the Princes who reign for themselves and not for the People preferring their own pleasure or profit before the publick become Tyrants which in his language is Enemys to God and  Man On this account  Boccalini  introduces the Princes of  Europe  raising a mutiny against him in  Parnassus  for giving such definitions of Tyrants as they said comprehended them all and forcing the poor Philosopher to declare by a new definition that  Che I Tiranni furono ce  ti h  omini del tempo antico de i quali hoggidi si e perdu  la razz  ▪  occal Rag d  Parn  Tyrants were certain men of antient times whose race is now extinguish'd  But with all his Wit and Learning he could not give a reason why those who do the same things that render'd the antient Tyrants detestable should not be so also in our days  In the third place The Scriptures declare the necessity of setting bounds to those who are plac'd in the highest dignitys  Moses  seems to have had as great abilitys as any man that ever liv'd in the world but he alone was not able to bear the weight of the Government and therefore God appointed Seventy chosen men to be his assistants This was a perpetual Law to  Israel  and as no King was to have more power than  Moses  or more abilitys to perform the Dutys of his Office none could be exempted from the necessity of wanting the like helps Our Author therefore must confess that they are Kings who have them or that Kingly Government is contrary to the Scriptures When God by  Moses  gave liberty to his People to make a King he did it under these conditions  He must be one  Deut  of their Brethren They must chuse him he must not multiply Gold Silver Wives or Horses he must not lift up his Heart above his Brethren  And  Josephus  paraphrasing upon the place says  He shall do nothing without the  Antiq Jud  advice of the  Sanhedrin  or if he do they shall oppose him  This agrees with the confession of  Zedekiah  to the Princes which was the  Sanhedrin The King can do nothing without you  and seems to have bin in pursuance of the Law of the Kingdom which was written in a Book and laid up  Jer    before the Lord and could not but agree with that of  Moses  unless they spake by different Spirits or that the Spirit by which they did speak was subject to error or change and the whole series of God's Law shews that the Pride Magnificence Pomp and Glory usurp'd by their Kings was utterly contrary to the will of God They did lift up their hearts above their Brethren which was forbidden by the Law All the Kings of  Israel  and most of the Kings of  Judah  utterly rejected it and every one of them did very much depart from the observation of it I will not deny that the People in their institution of a King intended they should do so they had done it themselves and would have a King that might uphold them in their disobedience they were addicted to the Idolatry of their accursed Neighbours and desir'd that Government by which it was maintain'd amongst them In doing this they did not reject  Samuel  but they rejected God that he should not reign over them They might perhaps believe that unless their King were such as the Law did not permit he would not perform what they intended or that the name of King did not belong to him unless he had a power that the Law deny'd But since God and his Prophets give the name of King to the chief Magistrate endow'd with a power that was restrain'd within very narrow limits whom they might without offence set up we also may safely give the same to those of the same nature whether it please  Filmer  or not  The practice of most Nations and I may truly say of all that deserve imitation has bin as directly contrary to the absolute power of one man as their Constitutions or if the original of many Governments lie hid in  the impenetrable darkness of Antiquity their progress may serve to shew the intention of the Founders  Aristotle  seems to think that the first Monarchs having bin chosen for their Vertue were little restrain'd in the exercise of their Power but that they or their Children falling into Corruption and Pride grew odious and that Nations did on that account either abolish their Authority or create Senats and other Magistrats who having part of the Power might keep them in order The  Spartan  Kings were certainly of this nature and the  Persian  till they conquer'd  Babylon  Nay I may safely say that neither the Kings which the frantick people set up in opposition to the Law of God nor those of the bordering Nations whose example they chose to follow had that absolute power which our Author attributes to all Kings as inseparable from the name  Achish  the  Philistin  lov'd and admir'd  David  he look'd upon him as an Angel of God and promis'd that he should be the keeper of  Sam  his Head for ever but when the Princes suspected him and said  he shall not go down with us to Battel  he was oblig'd to dismiss him This was not the language of Slaves but of those who had a great part in the Government and the King's submission to their will shows that he was more like to the Kings of  Sparta  than to an absolute Monarch who dos whatever pleases him I know not whether the  Spartans  were descended from the  Hebrews  as some think but their Kings were under a regulation much like that of the  th  of  Deuter  tho they had two Their Senate of twenty eight and the  Ephori  had a power like to that of the  Sanhedrin  and by them Kings were condemn'd to fines imprisonment banishment and death as appears by the examples of  Pausanias Cleonymus Leonidas Agis  and others The  Hebrew  Disciplin was the same  More Nevochim  Reges Davidicae stirpis  says  Maimonides judicabant judicabantur  They gave testimony in judgment when they were call'd and testimony was given against them Whereas the Kings of  Israel  as the same Author  Ibid  says were  superbi corde elati spertores legis nec judicabant nec judicabantur  proud insolent and contemners of the Law who would neither judg nor submit to judgment as the Law commanded But the Fruits they gather'd were sutable to the Seed they had sown and their Crimes were not left unpunish'd they who despis'd the Law were destroy'd without Law and when no ordinary course could be taken against them for their excesses they were overthrown by force and the Crown within the space of few years was transported into nine several Familys▪ with the utter extirpation of those that had possest it On the other hand there never was any Sedition against the  Spartan  Kings and after the moderate Disciplin according to which they liv'd was establish'd none of them dy'd by the hands of their Subjects except only two who were put to death in a way of Justice the Kingdom continu'd in the same races till  Cleomenes  was defeated by  Antigonus  and the Government overthrown by the  Macedonians  This gave occasion to those bestial Tyrants  Nabis  and  Machanidas  to set up such a Government as our Author recommends to the World which immediately brought destruction upon themselves and the whole City The  Germans  who pretended to be descended from the  Spartans  had the like Government Their  de  Germ  Princes according to their merit had the  credit of persuading not the power of commanding  and the question was not what part of the Government they would allow to the Nobility and People but what the Nobility and People would give to their Princes and 'tis not much material to our present dispute whether they learnt this from  ome obscure knowledg of  the Law which God gave to his People or whether led by the light of Reason which is also from God they discover'd what was altogether conformable to that Law Whoever understands the affairs of  Germany  knows that the present Emperors notwithstandiug their haughty Title have a power limited as in the days of  Tacitus  If they are good and wise they may persuade but they can command no farther than the Law allows They do not admit the Princes Noblemen and Citys to the power which they all exercise in their general Diets and each of them within their own Precincts but they exercise that which has bin by publick consent bestow'd upon them All the Kingdoms peopled from the North observ'd the same rules In all of them the powers were divided between the Kings the Nobility Clergy and Commons and by the Decrees of Councils Diets Parliaments Cortez and Assemblys of Estates Authority and Liberty were so balanc'd that such Princes as assum'd to themselves more than the Law did permit were severely punish'd and those who did by force or fraud invade Thrones were by force thrown down from them  This was equally beneficial to Kings and People The Powers as  Theopompus  King of  Sparta  said were most safe when they were least envy'd and hated  Lewis  the  th  of  France  was one of the first that broke this Golden Chain and by more subtil Arts than had bin formerly known subverted the Laws by which the fury of Kings had bin restrain'd and taught others to do the like tho all of them have not so well sav'd themselves from punishment  James  the third of  Scotland  was one of his most apt Scholars and  Ab hominibus infimae sortis in omnia simul vitia est praeceps datus tempora etiam corrupta vicinorum regum exempla non parum ad eum evertendum juverunt Nam Edvardus in A  glia Car  lus in Burgundia Ludovicus undecimus in Gallia Joannes secundus in Lusitania tyran  idis fundamenta jec  runt Richardus tertius in A  glia eam immanissime exercuit  Hist Scot l  Buchanan  in his Life says That  he was precipitated into all manner of Infamy by men of the most abject condition that the corruption of those times and the ill Example of neighbouring Princes were considerable motives to pervert him for  Edward  the fourth of  England Charles  of  Burgundy Lewis  the    th of  France  and  John  the second of  Portugal  had already laid the Foundations of Tyranny in those Countrys and  Richard  the third was then most cruelly exercising the same in the Kingdom of  England  This could not have bin if all the Power had always bin in Kings and neither the People nor the Nobility had ever had any For no man can be said to gain that which he and his Predecessors always possest or to take from others that which they never had nor to set up any sort of Government if it had bin always the same But the aforesaid  Lewis  the  th  did assume to himself a Power above that of his Predecessors and  Philip de Commines  shews the ways by which he acquir'd it with the miserable effects of his Acquisition both to himself and to his people Modern Authors observe that the change was made by him and for that reason he is said by  Mezeray  and others  to have brought those Kings out of  Davoir mi  les Roys hor  de page  Guardianship  they were not therefore so till he emancipated them Nevertheless this Emancipation had no resemblance to the unlimited Power of which our Author dreams The General Assemblys of Estates were o  ten held long after his death and continu'd in the exercise of the Sovereign Power of the Nation  Davila  speaking of the General Assembly  Hist delle Guerre Civ  held at  Orleans  in the time of  Francis  the second asserts the whole  Thuan Hist l  Power of the Nation to have bin in them  Monsieur de Thou  says the same thing and adds that the King dying suddenly the Assembly continu'd even at the desire of the Council in the exercise of that Power till they had settled the Regency and other Affairs of the highest importance according to their own judgment  Hottoman  a Lawyer of that  Hottom FrancoGallia  Time and Nation famous for his Learning Judgment and Integrity having diligently examin'd the antient Laws and Historys of that Kingdom distinctly proves that the  French  Nation never had any Kings but of their own chusing that their Kings had no Power except what was confer'd upon them and that they had bin remov'd when they excessively abus'd or render'd themselves unworthy of that Trust This is sufficiently clear by the forecited examples of  Pharamond  's Grandchildren and the degenerated Races of  Meroveus  and  Pepin  of which many were depos'd some of the nearest in Blood excluded and when their Vices seem'd to be incorrigible they were wholly rejected All this was done by virtue of that rule which they call the  Salique Law  And tho some of our Princes pretending to the Inheritance of that Crown by marrying the Heirs General deny'd that there was any such thing no man can say that for the space of above twelve hundred years Females or their Descendents who are by that Law excluded have ever bin thought to have any right to the Crown And no Law unless it be explicitely given by God can be of greater Authority than one which has bin in force for so many Ages What the beginning of it was is not known But  Charles  the sixth receding from this Law and thinking to dispose of the Succession otherwise than was ordain'd by it was esteem'd mad and all his Acts rescinded And tho the Reputation Strength and Valor of the  English  commanded by  Henry  the fifth one of the bravest Princes that have ever bin in the world was terrible to the  French  Nation yet they oppos'd him to the utmost of their power rather than suffer that Law to be broken And tho our Success under his Conduct was great and admirable yet soon after his death with the expence of much Blood and Treasure we lost all that we had on that side and suffer'd the Penalty of having unadvisedly enter'd into that Quarrel By virtue of the same Law the Agreement made by King  John  when he was Prisoner at  London  by which he had alienated part of that Dominion as well as that of  Francis  the first concluded when he was under the same Circumstances at  Madrid  were reputed null and upon all occasions that Nation has given sufficient testimony that the Laws by which they live are their own made by themselves and not impos'd upon them And 'tis as impossible for them who made and depos'd Kings exalted or deprest reigning Familys and prescrib'd Rules to the Succession to have receiv'd from their own Creatures the Power or part of the Government they had as for a man to be begotten by his own Son Nay tho their Constitution was much chang'd by  Lewis  the  th  yet they retain'd so much of their antient Liberty that in the last Age when the House of  Valois  was as much deprav'd as those of  Meroveus  and  Pepin  had bin and  Henry  the third by his own Leudness Hypocrisy Cruelty and Impurity together with the baseness of his Minions and Favorites had render'd himself odious and contemptible to the Nobility and People the great Citys Parliaments the greater and in political matters the sounder part of the Nation declar'd him to be fallen from the Crown and pursu'd him to the death tho the blow was given by the hand of a base and halfdistracted Monk  Henry  of  Bourbon  was without controversy the next Heir but neither the Nobility nor the People who thought themselves in the Government would admit him to the Crown till he had given them satisfaction that he would govern according to their Laws by abjuring his Religion which they judg'd inconsistent with them  The later Commotions in  Paris Bourdeaux  and other places together with the Wars for Religion shew that tho the  French  do not complain of every Grievance and cannot always agree in the defence and vindication of their violated Libertys yet they very well understand their Rights and that as they do not live by or for the King but he reigns by and for them so their Privileges are not from him but that his Crown is from them and that according to the true Rule of their Government he can do nothing against their Laws or if he do they may oppose him  The Institution of a Kingdom is the act of a free Nation and whoever denies them to be free denies that there can be any thing of right in what they set up That which was true in the beginning is so and must be so for ever This is so far acknowledg'd by the highest Monarchs that in a Treatise publish'd in the year by Authority of the present King of  France  to justify his pretensions to some part of the  Low Countrys  notwithstanding all the Acts of himself and the King of  Spain  to extinguish them it is said  Que les Roys ont certe bienheureuse impuissance de ne pouvoir rien faire contre les loix de leut pays  Traité des dro  de la Reyne  That Kings are under the happy inability to do any thing against the Laws of their Country  And tho perhaps he may do things contrary to Law yet he grounds his Power upon the Law and the most able and most trusted of his Ministers declare the same About the year the Count  D' Aubijoux  a man of eminent quality in  Languedoc  but averse to the Court and hated by Cardinal  Mazarin  had bin try'd by the Parliament of  Tholouse  for a Duel in which a Gentleman was kill'd and it appearing to the Court then in that City that he had bin acquitted upon forg'd Letters of Grace false Witnesses powerful Friends and other undue means  Mazarin  desir'd to bring him to a new Trial but the Chancellor  Seguier  told the QueenMother it could not be for the Law did not permit a man once acquitted to be again question'd for the same Fact and that if the course of the Law were interrupted neither the Salique Law nor the succession of her Children or any thing else could be secure in  France  This is farther prov'd by the Historys of that Nation The Kings of  Meroveus  and  Pepin  's Races were suffer'd to divide the Kingdom amongst their Sons or as  Hottoman  says the Estates made the Division and allotted to each such a part as they thought fit But when this way was found to be prejudicial to the Publick an Act of State was made in the time of  Hugh Capet  by which it was ordain'd that for the future the Kingdom should not be dismembred which Constitution continuing in force to this day the Sons or Brothers of their Kings receive such an  Apannage  they call it as is bestow'd on them remaining subject to the Crown as well as other men And there has bin no King of  France  since that time except only  Charles  the sixth who has not acknowledged that he cannot alienate any part of their Dominion  Whoever imputes the acknowledgment of this to Kingcraft and says that they who avow this when 'tis for their advantage will deny it on a  different occasion is of all men their most dangerous Enemy In laying such fraud to their charge he destroys the veneration by which they subsist and teaches Subjects not to keep Faith with those who by the most malicious deceits show that they are ty'd by none Human Societys are maintain'd by mutual Contracts which are of no value if they are not observ'd Laws are made and Magistrats created to cause them to be perform'd in publick and private matters and to punish those who violate them But none will ever be observ'd if he who receives the greatest benefit by them and is set up to oversee others give the example  Suarum legum lator eversor  Tacit  to those who of themselves are too much inclin'd to break them The first step that  Pompey  made to his own ruin was by violating the Laws he himself had propos'd But it would be much worse for Kings to break those that are establish'd by the Authority of a whole People and confirm'd by the succession of many Ages  I am far from laying any such blemishes on them or thinking that they deserve them I must believe the  French  King speaks sincerely when he says he can do nothing against the Laws of his Country And that our King  James  did the like when he acknowledg'd himself to be the Servant of the Commonwealth and the rather because 'tis true and that he is plac'd in the Throne to that end Nothing is more essential and fundamental in the Constitutions of Kingdoms than that Diets Parliaments and Assemblys of Estates should see this perform'd 'Tis not the King that gives them a right to judg of matters of War or Peace to grant Supplys of men and mony or to deny them and to make or abrogate Laws at their pleasure All the Powers rightly belonging to Kings or to them proceed from the same root The Northern Nations seeing what mischiefs were generally brought upon the Eastern by referring too much to the irregular will of a man and what those who were more generous had suffer'd when one man by the force of a corrupt mercenary Soldiery had overthrown the Laws by which they liv'd fear'd they might fall into the same misery and therefore retain'd the greater part of the Power to be exercis'd by their General Assemblys or by Delegates when they grew so numerous that they could not meet These are the Kingdoms of which  Grotius  speaks  where the King has his part and the Senat or People their part of the supreme Authority  and where the Law prescribes such limits  that if the King attempts to seize that part which is not his he may justly be oppos'd  Which is as much as to say that the Law upholds the Power it gives and turns against those who abuse it  This Doctrin may be displeasing to CourtParasites but is no less profitable to such Kings as follow better Counsels than to the Nations that live under them the Wisdom and Vertue of the best is always fortify'd by the concurrence of those who are plac'd in part of the Power they always do what they will when they will nothing but that which is good and 'tis a happy impotence in those who thro ignorance or malice desire to do evil not to be able to effect it The weakness of such as by defects of Nature Sex Age or Education are not able of themselves to bear the weight of a Kingdom is thereby supported and they together with the People under them preserv'd from ruin the furious rashness of the Insolent is restrain'd the extravagance of those who are naturally leud is aw'd and the bestial madness of the most violently wicked and outrageous supprest When the Law provides for these matters and prescribes ways by which they may be accomplish'd every  man who receives or fears any Injury seeks a remedy in a legal way and vents his Passions in such a manner as brings no prejudice to the Commonwealth If his Complaints against a King may be heard and redrest by Courts of Justice Parliaments and Diets as well as against private men he is satisfy'd and looks no farther for a Remedy But if Kings like those of  Israel  will neither judg nor be judg'd and there be no Power orderly to redress private or publick Injurys every man has recourse to force as if he liv'd in a Wood where there is no Law and that force is generally mortal to those who provoke it No Guards can preserve a hated Prince from the vengeance of one resolute hand and they as often fall by the Swords of their own Guards as of others Wrongs will be done and when they that do them cannot or will not be judg'd publickly the injur'd Persons become Judges in their own case and Executioners of their own sentence If this be dangerous in matters of private concernment 'tis much more so in those relating to the publick The leud extravagances of  Edward  and  Richard  the Seconds whilst they acknowledg'd the power of the Law were gently reprov'd and restrain'd with the removal of some profligate Favorites but when they would admit of no other Law than their own Will no relief could be had but by their Deposition The lawful  Spartan  Kings who were obedient to the Laws of their Country liv'd in safety and dy'd with glory whereas 'tis a strange thing to see a lawless Tyrant die without such infamy and misery as held a just proportion with the wickedness of his Life They did as  Plutarch  says of  Dionysius many mischiefs and suffer'd  Vit Timoleon▪  more  This is confirm'd by the examples of the Kingdom of  Israel  and of the Empires of  Rome  and  Greece  they who would submit to no Law were destroy'd without any I know not whether they thought themselves to be Gods as our Author says they were but I am sure the most part of them dy'd like Dogs and had the burial of Asses rather than of Men  This is the happiness to which our Author would promote them all  If a King admits a People to be his companions he ceases to be a King and the State becomes a Democracy  And a little farther  If in such Assemblys the King Nobility and People have equal shares in the Sovereignty then the King has but one voice the Nobility likewise one and the People one and then any two of these voices should have power to overrule the third Thus the Nobility and Commons should have a power to make a Law to bridle the King which was never seen in any Kingdom  We have heard of Nations that admitted a man to reign over them that is made him King but of no man that made a People The  Hebrews  made  Saul David Jeroboam  and other Kings when they return'd from Captivity they confer'd the same Title upon the  Asmonean  race as a reward of their Valor and Vertue The  Romans  chose  Romulus Numa Hostilius  and others to be their Kings the  Spartans  instituted two one of the  Heraclidae  the other of the  Aeacid  e  Other Nations set up one a few or more Magistrats to govern them and all the World agrees that  Qui dat esse dat modum esse  He that makes him to be makes him to be what is and nothing can be more absurd than to say that he who has nothing but what is given can have more than is given to him If  Saul  and  Romulus  had no other title to be Kings than what the People confer'd upon them they could be no otherwise Kings than as pleas'd the People They therefore did not admit the People to be partakers of the Government but the People who had all in themselves and could not have made a King if  they had not had it bestow'd upon him what they thought fit and retain'd the rest in themselves If this were not so then instead of saying to the multitude  Will ye have this man to reign  they ought to say to the man  Wilt thou have this multitude to be a People  And whereas the Nobles of  Arragon  us'd to say to their new made King  We who are as good as you make you our King on condition you keep and maintain our Rights and Libertys and if not not  he should have said to them I who am better than you make you to be a People and will govern you as I please But I doubt whether he would have succeeded till that Kingdom was join'd to others of far greater strength from whence a power might be drawn to force them out of their usual method  That which has bin said of the Governments of  England France  and other Countrys shows them to be of the same nature and if they deserve not the name of Kingdoms and that their Princes will by our Author's Arguments be persuaded to leave them those Nations perhaps will be so humble to content themselves without that magnificent Title rather than resign their own Libertys to purchase it and if this will not please him he may seek his glorious sovereign Monarchy among the wild  Arabs  or in the Island of  Ceylon  for it will not be found among civiliz'd Nations  However more ignorance cannot be exprest than by giving the name of  Democracy  to those Governments that are compos'd of the three simple species as we have prov'd that all the good ones have ever bin for in a strict sense it can only sute with those where the People retain to themselves the administration of the supreme Power and more largely when the popular part as in  Athens  greatly overbalances the other two and that the denomination is taken from the prevailing part But our Author if I mistake not is the first that ever took the antient Governments of  Israel Sparta  and  Rome  or those of  England France Germany  and  Spain  to be  Democracys  only because every one of them had Senats and Assemblys of the People who in their Persons or by their Deputys did join with their chief Magistrats in the exercise of the supreme Power That of  Israel  to the time of  Saul  is call'd by  Josephus  an  Aristocracy  The same name is  ven to that of  Sparta  by all the  Greek  Authors and the great contest in the  Peloponnesian  War was between the two kinds of Government the Citys that were govern'd Aristocratically or desir'd to be so following the  Lacedemonians  and such as delighted in  Democracy  taking part with the  Athenians  In like manner  Rome England  and  France  were said to be under Monarchys not that their Kings might do what they pleas'd but because one man had a preheminence above any other Yet if the  Romans  could take  Romulus  the Son of a man that was never known  Numa  a  Sabin Hostilius  and  Ancus Martius  private men and  Tarquinius Priscus  the Son of a banish'd  Corinthian  who had no Title to a preference before others till it was bestow'd upon them 'tis ridiculous to think that they who gave them what they had could not set what limits they pleas'd to their own gift  But says our Author  The Nobility will then have one Voice and the People another and they joining may overrule the third which was never seen in any Kingdom  This may perhaps be one way of regulating the Monarchical Power but it is not necessary nor the only one There may be a Senate tho the People be excluded that Senate may be compos'd of men chosen for their Vertue as well as for the Nobility of their Birth The Government may consist of King and People without a Senate or the  Senate may be compos'd only of the Peoples Delegates But if I should grant his assertion to be true the reasonableness of such a Constitution cannot be destroy'd by the consequences he endeavors to draw from it for he who would instruct the world in matters of State must show what is or ought to be not what he fancys may thereupon ensue Besides it dos not follow that where there are three equal Votes Laws should be always made by the plurality for the consent of all the three is in many places requir'd and 'tis certain that in  England  and other parts the King and one of the Estates cannot make a Law without the concurrence of the other But to please  Filmer  I will avow that where the Nobles and Commons have an equal Vote they may join and overrule or limit the power of the King and I leave any reasonable man to judg whether it be more safe and fit that those two Estates comprehending the whole body of the Nation in their Persons or by representation should have a right to overrule or limit the power of that man woman or child who sits in the Throne or that he or she young or old wise or foolish good or bad should over rule them and by their vices weakness folly impertinence incapacity or malice put a stop to their proceedings and whether the chief concernments of a Nation may more safely and prudently be made to depend upon the votes of so many eminent Persons amongst whom many wise and good men will always be found if there be any in the Nation and who in all respects have the same interest with them or upon the will of one who may be and often is as vile ignorant and wretched as the meanest Slave and either has or is for the most part made to believe he has an interest so contrary to them that their suppression is his Advancement Common sense so naturally leads us to the decision of this Question that I should not think it possible for Mankind to have mistaken tho we had no examples of it in History and 'tis in vain to say that all Princes are not such as I represent for if a right were annex'd to the being of a Prince and that his single judgment should overbalance that of a whole Nation it must belong to him as a Prince and be enjoy'd by the worst and basest as well as by the wisest and best which would inevitably draw on the absurditys above mention'd But that many are and have bin such no man can deny or reasonably hope that they will not often prove to be such as long as any preference is granted to those who have nothing to recommend them but the Familys from whence they derive a continual succession of those who excel in Vertue Wisdom and Experience being promis'd to none nor reasonably to be expected from any Such a Right therefore cannot be claim'd by all and if not by all then not by any unless it proceed from a particular grant in consideration of personal Vertue Ability and Integrity which must be prov'd and when any one goes about to do it I will either acknowledg him to be in the right or give the reasons of my denial  However this is nothing to the general Proposition nay if a man were to be found who had more of the qualitys requir'd for making a right judgment in matters of the greatest importance than a whole Nation or an Assembly of the best men chosen out of it which I never heard to have bin unless in the Persons of  Moses Joshua  or  Samuel  who had the Spirit of God for their guide it would be nothing to our purpose for even he might be biass'd by his personal Interests which Governments are not establish'd to promote  I may go a step farther and truly say that as such vast Powers cannot be generally granted to all who happen to succeed in any Familys without evident danger of utter Destruction when they come to be executed by children women fools vicious incapable or wicked persons they can be reasonably granted to none because no man knows what any one will prove till he be try'd and the importance of the Affair requires such a trial as can be made of no man till he be dead He that resists one Temptation may fall under the Power of another and nothing is more common in the world than to see those men fail grosly in the last actions of their lives who had pass'd their former days without reproach Wise and good men will with  Moses  say of themselves  I cannot bear the burden  and every man who is concern'd for the publick Good ought to let fools know they are not fit to undergo it and by Law to restrain the fury of such as will not be guided by reason This could not be deny'd tho Governments were constituted for the good of the Governor 'Tis good for him that the Law appoints helps for his Infirmitys and restrains his Vices but all Nations ought to do it tho it were not so in as much as Kingdoms are not establish'd for the good of one man but of the People and that King who seeks his own good before that of the People departs from the end of his Institution  This is so plain that all Nations who have acted freely have some way or other endeavour'd to supply the defects or restrain the vices of their supreme Magistrats and those among them deserve most praise who by appointing means adequate to so great a work have taken care that it might be easily and safely accomplish'd Such Nations have always flourish'd in Vertue Power Glory and Happiness whilst those who wanted their Wisdom have suffer'd all manner of Calamitys by the weakness or injustice of their Princes or have had their hands perpetually in Blood to preserve themselves from their fury We need no better example of the first than that of the  Spartans  who by appointing such Limits to the power of their Kings as could hardly be transgrest continu'd many Ages in great union with them and were never troubled with civil Tumults The like may be said of the  Romans  from the expulsion of the  Tarquins  till they overthrew their own Orders by continuing  Marius  for five years in the Consulat whereas the Laws did not permit a man to hold the same Office two years together and when that rule was broken their own Magistrats grew too strong for them and subverted the Commonwealth When this was done and the power came into the hands of one man all manner of evils and calamitys broke in like a flood 'Tis hard to judg whether the mischiefs he did or those he suffer'd were the greater He who set up himself to be Lord of the World was like to a Beast crown'd for the slaughter and his greatness was the forerunner of his ruin By this means some of those who seem not to have bin naturally prone to evil were by their fears put upon such courses to preserve themselves as being rightly estimated were worse than the death they apprehended and the so much celebrated  Constantine  the Great dy'd no less polluted with the Blood of his nearest Relations and Friends than  Nero  himself But no place can show a more lively  de  de    picture of this than the Kingdoms of  Granada  and others possest by the  Moors  in  Spain  where there being neither Senate nor Assemblys of the Nobility and People to restrain the violence and fury of their Kings they had no other way than to kill them when their vices became insupportable which happening for the most part they were almost all murder'd  and things were brought to such extremity that no man would accept a Crown except he who had neither Birth nor Vertue to deserve it  If it be said that Kings have now found out more easy ways of doing what they please and securing themselves I answer that they have not prov'd so to all and it is not yet time for such as tread in the same steps to boast of their success many have fallen when they thought their designs accomplish'd and no man as long as he lives can reasonably assure himself the like shall not befal him But if in this corrupted Age the treachery and perjury of Princes be more common than formerly and the number of those who are brought to delight in the rewards of injustice be so increas'd that their partys are stronger than formerly this rather shows that the balance of Power is broken or hard to be kept up than that there ought to be none and 'tis difficult for any man without the Spirit of Prophecy to tell what this will produce Whilst the antient Constitutions of our Northern Kingdoms remain'd intire such as contested with their Princes sought only to reform the Governments and by redressing what was amiss to reduce them to their first Principles but they may not perhaps be so modest when they see the very nature of their Government chang'd and the foundations overthrown I am not sure that they who were well pleas'd with a moderate Monarchy will submit to one that is absolute and 'tis not improbable that when men see there is no medium between Tyranny and Popularity they who would have bin contented with the reformation of their Government may proceed farther and have recourse to Force when there is no help in the Law This will be a hard work in those places where Vertue is wholly abolish'd but the difficulty will lie on the other side if any sparks of that remain if Vice and Corruption prevail Liberty cannot subsist but if Vertue has the advantage arbitrary Power cannot be establish'd Those who boast of their  Loyalty  and think they give testimonys of it when they addict themselves to the will of one Man tho contrary to the Law from whence that Quality is deriv'd may consider that by putting their Masters upon illegal courses they certainly make them the worst of men and bring them into danger of being also the most miserable Few or no good Princes have fallen into disasters unless thro an extremity of corruption introduc'd by the most wicked and cannot properly be call'd unhappy if they perish'd in their Innocence since the bitterness of Death is assuag'd by the tears of a loving People the assurance of a glorious memory and the quiet of a wellsatisfy'd mind But of those who have abandon'd themselves to all manner of Vice follow'd the impulse of their own fury and set themselves to destroy the best men for opposing their pernicious designs very few have dy'd in peace Their Lives have bin miserable Death infamous and Memory detestable  They therefore who place Kings within the power of the Law and the Law to be a guide to Kings equally provide for the good of King and People Whereas they who admit of no participants in power and acknowledg no rule but their own Will set up an interest in themselves against that of their People lose their affections which is their most important Treasure and incur their hatred from whence results their greatest danger  SECT XXXI The Libertys of Nations are from God and Nature not from Kings  WHatsoever is usually said in opposition to this seems to proceed from a groundless conceit that the Libertys enjoy'd by Nations arise from the Concessions of Princes This point has bin already treated but being the foundation of the Doctrin I oppose it may not be amiss farther to examin how it can be possible for one man born under the same condition with the rest of Mankind to have a Right in himself that is not common to all others till it be by them or a certain number of them confer'd upon him or how he can without the utmost absurdity be said to grant Libertys and Privileges to them who made him to be what he is  If I had to do with a man that sought after Truth I should think he had bin led into this extravagant opinion by the terms ordinarily us'd in Patents and Charters granted to particular men and not distinguishing between the Proprietor and the Dispenser might think Kings had given as their own that which they only distribute out of the publick Treasury and could have had nothing to distribute by parcels if it had not bin given to them in gross by the Publick But I need not use our Author so gently The perversity of his judgment and obstinate hatred to Truth is sufficient to draw him into the most absurd errors without any other inducement and it were not charity but folly to think otherwise of one who attributes in general to all Princes without any regard to the ways by which they attain to their Power such an Authority as never justly belong'd to any  This will be evident to all those who consider that no man can confer upon others that which he has not in himself If he be originally no more than they he cannot grant to them or any of them more than they to him In the  th    th    th  and subsequent Sections of the first Chapter it has bin prov'd that there is no resemblance between the paternal Right and the absolute Power which he asserts in Kings that the right of a Father whatever it be is only over his Children that this right is equally inherited by them all when he dies that every one cannot inherit Dominion for the right of one would be inconsistent with that of all others that the right which is common to all is that which we call Liberty or exemption from Dominion that the first Fathers of Mankind after the Flood had not the exercise of Regal Power and whatsoever they had was equally devolv'd to every one of their Sons as appears by the examples of  Noah Shem Abraham Isaac Jacob  and their Children that the erection of  Nimrod  's Kingdom was directly contrary to and inconsistent with the paternal right if there was any regality in it that the other Kingdoms of that time were of the same nature that  Nimrod  not exceeding the age of threescore years when he built  Babel  could not be the Father of those that assisted him in that attempt that if the seventy two Kings who as our Author says went from  Babylon  upon the consusion of Languages were not the Sons of  Nimrod  he could not govern them by the right of a Father if they were they must have bin very voung and could not have Children of their own to people the Kingdoms they set up that whose Children soever they were who out of a part of  Mankind did within a hundred and thirty two years after the Flood divide into so many Kingdoms they shew'd that others in process of time might subdivide into as many as they pleas'd and Kingdoms multiplying in the space of four thousand years since the in the same proportion they did in one hundred and thirty two years into seventy two there would now be as many Kings in the World as there are men that is no man could be subject to another that this equality of Right and exemption from the domination of any other is call'd Liberty that he who enjoys it cannot be depriv'd of it unless by his own consent or by force that no one man can force a Multitude or if he did it could confer no right upon him that a Multitude consenting to be govern'd by one man dos confer upon him the power of governing them the powers therefore that he has are from them and they who have all in themselves can receive nothing from him who has no more than every one of them till they do invest him with it This is prov'd by sacred and profane Historys The  Hebrews  in the creation of Judges Kings or other Magistrats had no regard to Paternity or to any who by extraction could in the least pretend to the right of Fathers God did never direct them to do it nor reprove them for neglecting it If they would chuse a King he commanded them to take one of their Brethren not one who call'd himself their Father When they did resolve to have one he commanded them to chuse him by lot and caus'd the Lot to fall upon a young man of the youngest Tribe  David  and the other Kings of  Israel  or  Judah  had no more to say for themselves in that point than  Saul  All the Kings of that Nation before and after the Captivity ordinarily or extraordinarily set up justly or unjustly were rais'd without regard to any Prerogative they could claim or arrogate to themselves on that account All that they had therefore was from their elevation and their elevation from those that elevated them 'Twas impossible for them to confer any thing upon those from whom they receiv'd all they had or for the People to give power to Kings if they had not had it in themselves which Power universally residing in every one is that which we call Liberty The method of other Nations was much like to this They plac'd those in the Throne who seem'd best to deserve so great an Honour and most able to bear so great a Burden The Kingdoms of the Heroes were nothing else but the Government of those who were most beneficent to the Nations amongst whom they liv'd and whose Vertues were thought fit to be rais'd above the ordinary level of the World Tho perhaps there was not any one  Athenian  or  Roman  equal to  Theseus  or  Romulus  in courage and strength yet they were not able to subdue many or if any man should be so vain to think that each of them did at first subdue one man then two and so proceeding by degrees conquer'd a whole People he cannot without madness ascribe the same to  Numa  who being sent for  rom a soreign Country was immediately made King of a fierce People that had already conquer'd many of their Neighbours and was grown too boisterous even for  Romulus  himself The like may be said of the first  Tarquin  and of  Servius  they were Strangers and tho  Tullus Hostilius  and  Ancus Martius  were  Romans  they had as little title to a Dominion over their FellowCitizens or means of attaining to it as if they had come srom the farthest parts of the Earth This must be in all places unless one man could prove by a perfect and uninterrupted Genealogy that he is the eldest Son of the eldest Line of  Noah  and that Line to have  continu'd perpetually in the Government of the World for if the Power has bin divided it may be subdivided to infinity if interrupted t  e chain is broken and can never be made whole But if our Author can perform this for the service of any man I willingly surrender my Arms and yield up the Cause I defend If he fail 'tis ridiculous to pretend a Right that belongs to no man or to go about to retrieve a Right which for the space of four thousand years has lain dormant and much more to create that which never had a subsistence This leads us necessarily to a conclusion That all Kingdoms are at the first erected by the consent of Nations and given to whom they please or else all are set up by force or some by force and some by consent If any are set up by the con  ent of Nations their Kings do not confer Libertys upon those Nations but receive all from them and the general Proposition is false If our Author therefore or his Followers would confute me they must prove that all the Kingdoms of the World have their beginning from force and that Force dos always create a Right or if they recede from the general Proposition and attribute a peculiar right to one or more Princes who are so absolute Lords of their People that those under them have neither Liberty Privilege Property or Part in the Government but by their Concessions they must prove that those Princes did by force gain the Power they have and that their Right is deriv'd from it This Force also must have bin perpetually continu'd for if that force be the root of the Right that is pretended another force by the same rule may overturn extinguish or transfer it to another hand If Contracts have interven'd the force ceases and the Right that afterwards dos accrue to the persons must proceed from and be regulated according to those Contracts  This may be sufficient to my purpose For having already prov'd that the Kingdoms of  Israel Judah Rome Sparta France Spain England  and all that we are concern'd in or that deserve to be examples to us did arise from the consent of the respective Nations and were frequently reduc'd to their first Principles when the Princes have endeavour'd to transgress the Laws of their Institution it could be nothing to us tho  Attila  or  Tamerlan  had by force gain'd the Dominions they possest But I dare go a step further and boldly assert that there never was or can be a man in the world that did or can subdue a Nation and that the right of one grounded upon force is a mere whimsy It was not  Agathocles Dionysius Nabis Marius Sylla  or  Cesar  but the mercenary Soldiers and other Villains that join'd with them who subdu'd the  Syracusans Spartans  or  Romans  And as the work was not perform'd by those Tyrants alone if a right had bin gain'd by the violence they us'd it must have bin common to all those that gain'd it and he that commanded them could have had no more than they thought fit to conser upon him When  Plut in V  t C    Miltiades  desir'd leave to wear an Olive Garland in commemoration of the Victory obtain'd at  Marathon  an  Athenian  did in my opinion rightly say  "If you alone did fight against the  Persians  it is just that you only should be crown'd but if others did participate in the Victory they ought also to have a part in the Honor"  And the principal difference that I have observ'd between the most regular proceedings of the wisest Senats or Assemblys of the people in their Persons or Delegats and the sury of the most dissolute Villains has bin that the first seeking the publick good do usually set up such a Man and invest him with such Powers as seem most conducing to that Good whereas the others following  the impulse of a bestial rage and aiming at nothing but the satisfaction of their own lusts always advance one from whom they expect the greatest advantages to themselves and give him such Powers as most conduce to the accomplishment of their own ends but as to the Person 'tis the same thing  Cesar  and  Nero  did no more make themselves what they were than  Numa  and could no more confer any Right Liberty or Privilege upon the Army that gave them all they had than the most regular Magistrate could upon the Senat or People that chose him  This also is common to the worst as well as the best that they who set up either do as into a publick Treasury confer upon the Person they chuse a Power of distributing to particular men or numbers of men such Honors Privileges and Advantages as they may seem according to the Principles of the Government to deserve But there is this difference that the ends of the one being good and those of the other evil the first do for the most part limit the Powers that something may remain to reward Services done to the Publick in a manner proportion'd to the merit of every one placing other Magistrats to see it really perform'd so as they may not by the weakness or vices of the Governor be turn'd to the publick detriment the others think they never give enough that the Prince having all in his Power may be able to gratify their most exorbitant desires if by any ways they can get his favour and his infirmitys and vices being most beneficial to them they seldom allow to any other Magistrate a power of opposing his Will or suffer those who for the publick good would assume it The World affords many examples of both sorts and every one of them have had their progress sutable to their Constitution The regular Kingdoms of  England France Spain Poland Bohemia Denmark Sweden  and others whether elective or hereditary have had High Stewards Constables Mayors of the Palace Rixhofmeisters Parliaments Diets Assemblys of Estates Cortez and the like by which those have bin admitted to succeed who seem'd most fit for the publick Service the unworthy have bin rejected the infirmitys of the weak supply'd the malice of the unjust restrain'd and when necessity requir'd the Crown transfer'd from one Line or Family to another But in the furious Tyrannys that have bin set up by the violence of a corrupted Soldiery as in the antient  Roman  Empire the Kingdoms of the  Moors  and  Arabians  the Tyrannys of  Ezzelino  of  Padoa  those of the  Visconti  and  Sforzeschi  of  Milan Castruccio Castraccani  of  Lucca Cesar Borgia  and others there was nothing of all this The Will of the Prince was a Law all Power was in him and he kept it till another stept up and took it from him by the same means that he had gain'd it This fell out so frequently that tho all the  Roman  Emperors endeavour'd to make their Power hereditary it hardly continu'd three Generations in one Line from  Augustus  to  Augustulus  unless in that of  Constantine  and that with extreme confusion and disorder They who had madly set up a Man to be their Head and expos'd so much of the World as was under their power to be destroy'd by him did by the like fury throw him down and never ceas'd till they had brought the Empire to utter ruin  But if this paternal Sovereignty be a mere fiction that never had any effect and no Nation was ever commanded by God to make it their rule nor any reprov'd for the neglect of it none ever learnt it from the light of nature nor were by wise men taught to regard it If the first Fathers claim'd no Privilege from it when every man's Genealogy was  known and tho there were such a thing in nature it could be of no use at this day when the several Races of men are so confus'd that not one in the world can prove his own Original If the first Kingdoms whether well or ill constituted according to the Command of God or the Inventions of Men were contrary to and incompatible with it and there can have bin no justice in any if such a Rule was to have bin observ'd the continuance of an unjust usurpation can never have created a Right but aggravated the injustice of overthrowing it If no man could ever by his own strength and courage subdue a multitude nor gain any other right over them if he did than they might have to tear it from him Whoever denies Kingdoms or other Magistracys to have bin set up by men according to their own will and from an opinion of receiving benefit by them accuses all the Governments that are or ever have bin in the world of that outrageous injustice in their Foundation which can never be repair'd If there be therefore or ever was any just Government amongst men it was constituted by them and whether their Proceedings were regular or violent just or unjust the Powers annex'd to it were their Donation The Magistracys erected by them whether in one or more men temporary or perpetual elective or hereditary were their Creatures and receiving all from them could confer nothing upon them  SECT XXXII The Contracts made between Magistrats and the Nations that created them were real solemn and obligatory  OUR Author having with big words and little sense inveigh'd against Popular and Mix'd Governments proceeds as if he had prov'd that they could not or ought not to be  If it be  says he  unnatural for the Multitude to chuse their Governors or to govern or to partake in the Government what can be thought of that damnable Conclusion which is made by too many that the Multitude may correct or depose their Princes if need be Surely the unnaturalness and injustice of this Position cannot sufficiently be exprest For admit that a King make a Contract or Paction with his People originally in his Ancestors or personally at his Coronation for both these Pactions some dream of but cannot offer any proof of either yet by no Law of any Nation can a Contract be thought broken except first a lawful trial be had by the ordinary Judg of the breakers thereof or else every man may be both Party and Judg in his own case which is absurd once to be thought for then it will lie in the hands of the headless multitude when they please to cast off the Yoke of Government that God has laid upon them and to judg and punish him by whom they should be judg'd and punish'd themselves  To this I answer first briefly That if it be natural for the Multitude to chuse their Governors or to govern or to participate of the Government as best pleases themselves or that there never was a Government in the World that was not so set up by them in pursuance of the Power naturally inherent in themselves what can be thought of that damnable Conclusion which has bin made by Fools or Knaves That the Multitude may not if need be correct or depose their own Magistrats Surely the unnaturalness and injustice of such a Position cannot be sufficiently exprest If that were admitted all the most solemn Pacts and  Contracts made between Nations and their Magistrats originally or personally and confirm'd by Laws and mutual Oaths would be of no value He that would break the most sacred Bonds that can be amongst men should by perjury and wickedness become Judg of his own case and by the worst of crimes procure impunity for all It would be in his power by folly wickedness and madness to destroy the Multitude which he was created and sworn to preserve tho wise vertuous and just and headed by the wisest and justest of men or to lay a Yoke upon those who by the Laws of God and Nature ought to be free He might in his own case judg that Body by which he ought to be judg'd and who in consideration of themselves and their own good made him to be whatsoever he is more than every one of them The Governments instituted for the preservation of Nations would turn to their destruction It would be impossible to check the fury of a corrupt and perfidious Magistrate The worst of men would be rais'd to a height that was never deserv'd by the best and the assurance of indemnity would by increasing their insolence turn their other vices into madness as has bin too often seen in those who have had more power than they deserv'd and were more hardly brought to account for their actions than ought to have bin tho I never heard of any who had so much as our Author asserts to be in all nor that any was absolutely assur'd he should not be question'd for the abuse of what he had  Besides if every People may govern or constitute and chuse one or more Governors they may divide the Powers between several Men or ranks of men allotting to every one so much as they please or retaining so much as they think fit This has bin practis'd in all the Governments which under several forms have flourish'd in  Palestine Greece Italy Germany France England  and the rest of the World The Laws of every place show what the Power of the respective Magistrate is and by declaring how much is allow'd to him declare what is deny'd for he has not that which he has not and is to be accounted a Magistrate whilst he exercises that which he has  If any doubts do hereupon arise I hope to remove them proving in the first place that several Nations have plainly and explicitly made Contracts with their Magistrats  That they are implicit and to be understood where they are not plainly exprest  That they are not dreams but real things and perpetually obliging  That Judges are in many places appointed to decide the Contests arising from the breach of these Contracts and where they are not or the party offending is of such force or pride that he will not submit Nations have bin oblig'd to take the extremest courses  To the first I suppose it will not be deny'd that the annual Magistrats of divers Commonwealths are under some Compact and that there is a power of constraining them to perform the contents or to punish them for the violation The modest behaviour of the  Roman  Consuls and Dictators as long as their Laws were in force might not probably proceed from their good nature Tho the people had not bin as our Author says  mad foolish and always desirous to chuse the worst men for being most like to themselves  but admirably wise and vertuous 'tis not to be imagin'd that in the space of three or four hundred years they should never have fallen upon one who would have transgrest if he could have done it safely tho they had us'd the utmost caution in their choice  But the power of the Consuls being only for a year that of the Dictator for six months at most and the Commission that he should take care  Ne quid detrimenti Respubl accipiat  the Commonwealth might suffer no damage show the end and condition upon which they were chosen and tho their Power is by some thought to have bin absolute yet the Consuls were frequently oppos'd and brought into order by the Senat Tribuns or People and sometimes  Plut Vit Camil  the Dictator himself  Camillus  in his fourth Dictatorship was threaten'd by the Tribuns with a great Fine and by that means oblig'd to abdicate his Magistracy I have already mention'd  Marcus Fabius Maximus  who in the behalf of his Son  Quintus  condemn'd to die by  Papirius  the Dictator appeal'd to the  Qui solus plus quam rua Dictatura potest pollet{que} cui reges cessere c  T Liv l    People And when the Conduct of  Fabius  in the War against  Hannibal  was not approv'd the Tribun thought he made a very modest Proposition in that he did not desire his Magistracy should be abrogated but that the Master of the Horse should be made equal to him in power which was done accordingly 'Tis agreed by all that the Consuls were in the place of Kings and that the Power of the Dictator was at least equal to what theirs had bin If they therefore were under such a rule which they could not transgress or might be reduc'd to order if they did and forc'd to submit to the People as the Kings had done the Kings were also made upon the same conditions and equally oblig'd to perform them  The Scripture is more clear in the case The Judges are said to have bin in power equal to Kings and I may perhaps ackowledg it with relation to the Deuteronomical King or such as the People might have chosen without offending God The  Gileadites  made a Covenant with  Jephtha  that he should be their Head and Captain He would not return to his Country till they had done it This was perform'd solemnly before the Lord in  Mispeth  and all  Israel  follow'd them They might therefore make a Covenant with their Kings for the difference of name dos not increase or diminish the Right Nay they were in duty oblig'd to do it The words of the  th  of  Deuter He shall not multiply Wives c that his Heart be not lifted up above his Brethren  can have no other signification than that they should take care he did it not or as  Josephus  says hinder him if he attempt it for the Law was not given to the King who was not but those who might make him if they thought fit In pursuance of this Law  The rest of this Chapter is wanting in the Original Manuscript  CHAP III  SECT I Kings not being Fathers of their People nor excelling all others in Vertue can have no other just Power than what the Laws give nor any title to the privileges of the Lord's Anointed  HAVING prov'd that the right of Fathers is from Nature and incommunicable it must follow that every man dos perpetually owe all love respect service and obedience to him that did beget nourish and educate him and to no other under that name No man therefore can claim the right of a Father over any except one that is so no man can serve two Masters the extent and perpetuity of the Duty which every man owes to his Father renders it impossible for him to owe the same to any other This right of Father cannot be devolv'd to the Heir of the Father otherwise than as every Son by the Law of Nature is Heir to his Father and has the same right of commanding his Children as his Father had of commanding him when he was a Child no man can owe to his Brother that which he ow'd to his Father because he cannot receive that from him which he had from his Father but the utmost of all absurditys that can enter into the Heart of man is for one to exact the rights due to a Father who has no other title than force and usurpation it being no less than to say that I owe as much to one who has done me the greatest of all Injurys as to him who has confer'd upon me the greatest Benefits or which is yet worse if possible that as these usurpations cannot be made but by robbing spoiling imprisoning or killing the Person in possession that Duty which by the eternal Law of Nature I owe to my Father should oblige me to pay the same veneration obedience and service to the man that has spoil'd imprison'd or kill'd my Father as I ow'd to him or that the same Law which oblig'd me to obey and defend my Father because he was so should oblige me to obey and defend his enemy because he has imprison'd or kill'd him and not only to pass over the Law of God which makes me the avenger of my Father's Blood but to reward his Murderer with the rights that comprehend all that is most tender and sacred in Nature and to look upon one that has done me the greatest of all injustices and injurys as upon him to whom I owe my Birth and Education This being evident to all those who have any measure of common sense I suppose it may be safely concluded that what right soever a Father may have over his Family it cannot relate to that which a King has over his People unless he like the man in the Island of  Pines  mention'd before be also the Father of them all That which is  absolutely unlike in manner and substance institution and exercise must be unlike in all respects and the Conclusions which have their strength from Similitude and Parity can have none when there is not the least similitude of either And tho it were true that Fathers are held by no contracts which generally 'tis not for when the Son is of age and dos something for the Father to which he is not oblig'd or gives him that which he is not bound to give suppose an Inheritance receiv'd from a Friend goods of his own acquisition or that he be emancipated all good Laws look upon those things as a valuable consideration and give the same force to contracts thereupon made as to those that pass between strangers it could have no relation to our question concerning Kings One principal reason that renders it very little necessary by the Laws of Nations to restrain the power of Parents over their Children is because 'tis presum'd they cannot abuse it they are thought to have a Law in their Bowels obliging them more strictly to seek their good than all those that can be laid upon them by another Power and yet if they depart from it so as inhumanly to abuse or kill their Children they are punish'd with as much rigor and accounted more unpardonable than other men Ignorance or wilful malice persuading our Author to pass over all this he boldly affirms  That the Father of a Family governs it by no other Law than his own Will  and from thence infers that the condition of Kings is the same He would seem to soften the harshness of this Proposition by saying  That a King is always ty'd by the same Law of Nature to keep this general ground that the safety of the Kingdom is his chief Law  But he spoils it in the next page by asserting  That it is not right for Kings to do injury but it is right that they go unpunish'd by the People if they do so that in this point it is all one whether  Samuel  describe a King or a Tyrant for patient obedience is due unto both no remedy in the Text against Tyrants but crying and praying unto God in that day  In this our Author according to the custom of Theaters runs round in a Circle pretends to grant that which is true and then by a lie endeavours to destroy all again Kings by the Law of Nature are oblig'd to seek chiefly the good of the Kingdom but there is no remedy if they do it not which is no less than to put all upon the Conscience of those who manifestly have none But if God has appointed that all other transgressions of the Laws of Nature by which a private man receives damage should be punish'd in this world notwithstanding the right reserv'd to himself of a future punishment I desire to know why this alone by which whole Nations may be and often are destroy'd should escape the hands of Justice If he presume no Law to be necessary in this case because it cannot be thought that Kings will transgress as there was no Law in  Sparta  against Adultery because it was not thought possible for men educated under that disciplin to be guilty of such a Crime and as divers Nations left a liberty to Fathers to dispose of their Children as they thought fit because it could not be imagin'd that any one would abuse that power he ought to remember that the  Spartans  were mistaken and for want of that Law which they esteem'd useless Adulterys became as common there as in any part of the world and the other error being almost every where discover'd the Laws of all civiliz'd Nations make it capital for a man to kill his Children and give redress to Children if they suffer any other extreme injurys from their Parents as well as to other persons But tho this were not so it would be nothing to our question unless it could be suppos'd that whoever gets the power of a Nation into his hands must be immediately fill'd with the same tenderness  of affection to the People under him as a Father naturally has towards the Children he has begotten He that is of this opinion may examin the lives of  Herod Tiberius Caligula  and some later Princes of like inclinations and conclude it to be true if he find that the whole course of their actions in relation to the People under them do well sute with the tender and sacred name of Father and altogether false if he find the contrary But since every man that considers what has bin or sees what is every day done in the world must confess that Princes or those who govern them do most frequently so utterly reject all thoughts of tenderness and piety towards the Nations under them as rather to seek what can be drawn from them than what should be done for them and sometimes become their most bitter and publick enemys 'tis ridiculous to make the safety of Nations to depend upon a supposition which by daily experience we find to be false and impious to prefer the lusts of a man who violates the most sacred Laws of Nature by destroying those he is oblig'd to preserve before the welfare of that People for whose good he is made to be what he is if there be any thing of justice in the Power he exercises  Our Author foolishly thinks to cover the enormity of this nonsense by turning  Salutem Populi  into  Salutem Regni  for tho  Regnum  may be taken for the power of commanding in which sense the preservation of it is the usual object of the care of Princes yet it dos more rightly signify the Body of that Nation which is govern'd by a King And therefore if the Maxim be true as he acknowledges it to be then  Salus Populi est Lex suprema  and the first thing we are to inquire is whether the Government of this or that man dos conduce to the accomplishment of that supreme Law or not for otherwise it ought to have bin said  Salus Regis est Lex suprema  which certainly never enter'd into the head of a wiser or better man than  Filmer  His Reasons are as good as his Doctrin  No Law  says he  can be impos'd on Kings because there were Kings before any Laws were made  This would not follow tho the Proposition were true for they who impos'd no Laws upon the Kings they at first made from an opinion of their Vertue as in those call'd by the Antients  Heroum regna  might lay restrictions upon them when they were found not to answer the expectation conceiv'd of them or that their Successors degenerated from their Vertue Other Nations also being instructed by the ill effects of an unlimited Power given to some Kings if there was any such might wisely avoid the Rock upon which their Neighbours had split and justly moderate that Power which had bin pernicious to others However a Proposition of so great importance ought to be prov'd but that being hard and perhaps impossible because the original of Nations is almost wholly unknown to us and their practice seems to have bin so various that what is true in one is not so in another he is pleas'd only to affirm it without giving the least shadow of a reason to persuade us to believe him This might justify me if I should reject his assertion as a thing said  gratis  but I may safely go a step farther and affirm That men liv'd under Laws before there were any Kings which cannot be deny'd if such a Power necessarily belongs to Kings as he ascribes to them For  Nimrod  who establish'd his Kingdom in  Babel  is the first who by the Scripture is said to have bin a mighty one in the Earth He was therefore the first King or Kings were not mighty and he being the first King Mankind must have liv'd till his time without Laws or else Laws were made before  Kings To say that there was then no Law is in many respects most absurd for the Nature of man cannot be without it and the violences committed by ill men before the Flood could not have bin blam'd if there had bin no Law for that which is not cannot be transgrest  Cain  could not have fear'd that every man who met him would slay him if there had not bin a Law to slay him that had slain another But in this case the Scripture is clear at least from the time that  Noah  went out of the Ark for God then gave him a Law sufficient for the state of things at that time if all violence was prohibited under the name of shedding Blood tho not under the same penalty as Murder But Penal Laws being in vain if there be none to execute them such as know God dos nothing in vain may conclude that he who gave this Law did appoint some way for its execution tho unknown to us There is therefore a Law not given by Kings but laid upon such as should be Kings as well as on any other Persons by one who is above them and perhaps I may say that this Law presses most upon them because they who have most power do most frequently break out into acts of Violence and most of all disdain to have their Will restrain'd and he that will exempt Kings from this Law must either find that they are excepted in the Text or that God who gave it has not a Power over them  Moreover it has bin prov'd at the beginning of this Treatise that the first Kings were of the accursed race and reign'd over the accursed Nations whilst the holy Seed had none If therefore there was no Law where there was no King the accursed Posterity of  Cham  had Laws when the blessed Descendents of  Shem  had none which is most absurd the word  Outlaw  or  Lawless  being often given to the wicked but never to the just and righteous  The impious folly of such Assertions goes farther than our Author perhaps suspected for if there be no Law where there is no King the  Israelites  had no Law till  Saul  was made King and then the Law they had was from him They had no King before for they ask'd one They could not have ask'd one of  Samuel  if he had bin a King He had not bin offended and God had not imputed to them the sin of rejecting him if they had ask'd that only which he had set over them If  Samuel  were not King  Moses Joshua  and the other Judges were not Kings for they were no more than he They had therefore no King and consequently if our Author says true no Law If they had no Law till  Saul  was King they never had any for he gave them none and the Prophets were to blame for denouncing judgments against them for receding from or breaking their Law if they had none He cannot say that  Samuel  Sam  gave them a Law for that which he wrote in a Book and laid up before the Lord was not a Law to the People but to the King If it had bin a Law to the People it must have bin made publick but as it was only to the King he laid it up before God to testify against him if he should adventure to break it Or if it was a Law to the People the matter is not mended for it was given in the time of a King by one who was not King But in truth it was the Law of the Kingdom by which he was King and had bin wholly impertinent if it was not to bind him for it was given to no other person and to no other end  Our Author's Assertion on which all his Doctrin is grounded  That there is no Nation that allows Children any action or remedy for being unjustly govern'd  is as impudently false as any other propos'd by him for tho a Child  will not be heard that complains of the Rod yet our own Law gives relief to Children against their Fathers as well as against other persons that do them injurys upon which we see many ill effects and I do rather relate than commend the practice In other places the Law gives relief against the extravagances of which Fathers may be guilty in relation to their Children tho not to that excess as to bring them so near to an equality as in  England  They cannot imprison sell or kill their Children without exposing themselves to the same punishments with other men and if they take their Estates from them the Law is open and gives relief against them but on the other side Children are punish'd with Death if they strike or outrageously abuse their Parents which is not so with us  Now if the Laws of Nations take such care to preserve private men from being too hardly us'd by their true and natural Fathers who have such a love and tenderness for them in their own Blood that the most wicked and barbarous do much more frequently commit crimes for them than against them how much more necessary is it to restrain the fury that Kings who at the best are but phantastical Fathers may exercise to the destruction of the whole People 'Tis a folly to say that  David  and some other Kings have had or that all should have as tender an affection towards their People as towards their Children for besides that even the first Proposition is not acknowledg'd and will be hardly verify'd in any one instance there is a vast distance between what men ought to be and what they are Every man ought to be just true and charitable and if they were so Laws would be of no use but it were a madness to abolish them upon a supposition that they are so or to leave them to a future punishment which many do not believe or not regard I am not oblig'd to believe that  David  lov'd every  Israelite  as well as his Son  Absalom  but tho he had I could not from thence infer that all Kings do so unless I were sure that all of them were as wise and vertuous as he  But to come more close to the matter Do we not know of many Kings who have come to their Power by the most wicked means that can enter into the heart of man even by the most outrageous injurys done to the People sometimes by a foreign aid as Kings were by the power of the  Romans  impos'd upon the  Britans  that they might wast the Forces and break the Spirits of that fierce people This  Tacitus  acknowledges and says  Inter instrumenta servitutis reges habuere  Tacit  That among other instruments of inslaving Nations they impos'd Kings upon them  The  Medices  were made Masters of  Florence  by the force of  Charles  the Fifth's Army Sometimes by a corrupt party in their own Country they have destroy'd the best men and subdu'd the rest as  Agathocles Dionysius  and  Cesar  did at  Rome  and  Syracuse  Others taking upon them to defend a People have turn'd the Arms with which they were entrusted against their own Masters as  Francesco Sforza  who being chosen by those of  Milan  to be their General against the  Venetians  made peace with them and by their assistance made himself Prince or in our Author's phrase Father of that great City If these be acts of tenderness love justice and charity those who commit them may well think they have gain'd the affections of their People and grow to love those from whom they fear nothing and by whom they think they are  lov'd But if on the other hand they know they have attain'd to their greatness by the worst of all Villanys and that they are on that account become the object of the publick hatred they can do no less than hate and fear those by whom they know themselves to be hated The  Italians  ordinarily say that  Chi fa in  uria non perdona mai  he who dos an injury never pardons because he thinks he is never pardon'd But he that enslaves and oppresses a People dos an injury which can never be pardon'd and therefore fears it will be reveng'd  Other Princes who come to their Thrones by better ways and are not contented with the power that the Law allows draw the same hatred upon themselves when they endeavour by force or fraud to enlarge it and must necessarily fear and hate their own People as much as he who by the ways beforemention'd has betray'd or subdu'd them Our Author makes nothing of this but taking it for granted that it was all one whether  Samuel  spoke of a King or a Tyrant declares that the same patient obedience is due to both but not being pleas'd to give any reason why we should believe him I intend to offer some why we should not  First there is nothing in the nature or institution of Monarchy that obliges Nations to bear the exorbitances of it when it degenerates into Tyranny  In the second place we have no precept for it  Thirdly we have many approv'd examples and occasional particular commands to the contrary  To the first The point of Paternity being explain'd the duty of Children to Parents prov'd to proceed from the benefits receiv'd from them and that the power over them which at the first seems to have bin left at large because it was thought they would never abuse it has long since bin much restrain'd in all civiliz'd Nations and particularly in our own We may conclude that men are all made of the same paste and that one ows no more to another than another to him unless for some benefit receiv'd or by virtue of some promise made The duty arising from a benefit receiv'd must be proportionable to it that which grows from a promise is determin'd by the promise or contract made according to the true sense and meaning of it He therefore that would know what the  Babylonians Hebrews Athenians  or  Romans  did owe to  Nimrod Saul Theseus  or  Romulus  must inquire what benefits were receiv'd from them or what was promis'd to them It cannot be said that any thing was due to them for the sake of their Parents they could have no prerogative by birth  Nimrod  was the sixth Son of  Chush  the Son of  Cham  who was the youngest Son of  Noah  his Kingdom was erected whilst  Noah  and his elder Sons  Shem  and  Japhet  as well as  Cham Chush  and his elder Sons were still living  Saul  was the Son of  Chish  a man of  Benjamin  who was the youngest Son of  Jacob  and he was chosen in the most Democratical way by Lot amongst the whole People  Theseus  according to the custom of the times pretended to be the Son of  Neptune  and  Rhea  was so well pleas'd with the Soldier that had gotten her with child that she resolv'd to think or say that  Mars  was the Father of the Children that is to say they were Bastards and therefore whatever was due to them was  upon their own personal account without any regard to their Progenitors This must be measur'd according to what they did for those Nations before they were Kings or by the manner of their advancement Nothing can be pretended before they were Kings  Nimrod  rose up after the confusion of Languages and the People that understood the tongue he spoke follow'd him  Saul  was a young man unknown in  Israel Theseus  and  Romulus  had nothing to recommend them before other  Athenians  and  Romans  except the reputation of their Valor and the Honors confer'd upon them for that reason must proceed from expectation or hope and not from gratitude or obligation It must therefore proceed from the manner by which they came to be Kings He that neither is nor has any title to be a King can come to be so only by force or by consent If by force he dos not confer a Benefit upon the People but injures them in the most outrageous manner If it be possible therefore or reasonable to imagin that one man did ever subdue a multitude he can no otherwise resemble a Father than the worst of all Enemys who dos the greatest mischiefs resembles the best of all Friends who confers the most inestimable benefits and consequently dos as justly deserve the utmost effects of hatred as the other dos of love respect and service If by consent he who is rais'd from amongst the people and plac'd above his Brethren receives great honors and advantages but confers none The obligations of gratitude are on his side and whatsoever he dos in acknowledgment to his Benefactors for their love to him is no more than his duty and he can demand no more from them than what they think fit to add to the favors already receiv'd If more be pretended it must be by virtue of that contract and can no otherwise be prov'd than by producing it to be examin'd that the true sense meaning and intention of it may be known  This Contract must be in form and substance according to a general Rule given to all mankind or such as is left to the will of every Nation If a general one be pretended it ought to be shown that by inquiring into the contents we may understand the force and extent of it If this cannot be done it may justly pass for a fiction no conclusion can be drawn from it and we may be sure that what Contracts soever have bin made between Nations and their Kings have bin fram'd according to the will of those Nations and consequently how many soever they are and whatsoever the sense of any or all of them may be they can oblige no man except those or at the most the Descendents of those that made them Whoever therefore would persuade us that one or more Nations are by virtue of those Contracts bound to bear all the insolences of Tyrants is oblig'd to show that by those Contracts they did for ever indefinitely bind themselves so to do how great soever they might be  I may justly go a step farther and affirm That if any such should appear in the world the folly and turpitude of the thing would be a sufficient evidence of the madness of those that made it and utterly destroy the contents of it but no such having bin as yet produc'd nor any reason given to persuade a wise man that there has ever bin any such at least among civiliz'd Nations for whom only we are concern'd it may be concluded there never was any or is there were they do not at all relate to our subject and consequently that Nations still continue in their native Liberty and are no otherwise oblig'd to endure the insolence of Tyrants than they or each of them may esteem them tolerable  To the second Tho the words of  Samuel  had imply'd a necessity incumbent upon the  Hebrews  to bear all the Injurys that their Kings should do to them it could no way relate to us for he dos not speak of all Kings but of such as they had ask'd even such as reign'd over the slavish  Asiaticks  their Neighbors who are no less infamous in the world for their baseness and cowardice than detestable for their idolatry and vices It was not a plot or trick of  Samuel  to keep the Government in himself and Family such scurrilous expressions or thoughts are fit only for  Filmer Heylin  and their Disciples But the Prophet being troubled at the folly and wickedness of the people who chose rather to subject themselves to the irregular Will of a Man than to be govern'd by God and his Law did by the immediate command of God declare to them what would be the event of their fury that since they would be like to their Neighbors in sin and folly he told 'em they should be like to them in shame and misery since they desir'd to cast off the thing that was good they should suffer evil as the product of their own Counsels and that when they should cry to the Lord from a sense of their miserys he dos not tell them as our Author falsly says they should have no other remedy against Tyrants but crying and praying but that their crys and prayers should not be heard It was just that when they had rejected God he should reject them and leave them under the weight of the calamitys they had brought upon themselves In all other cases God had ever said that when his People return'd to him he would hear and save them When they cry'd by reason of the oppressions they suffer'd under the  Egyptians Cananites Midianites Philistins  and others tho their crimes had deserv'd them all yet God heard and reliev'd them But when they meditated this final defection from his Law and rejection of his Government God seem'd to change his Nature and forget to be gracious  When ye shall cry to me by reason of your King I will not hear you  This was the strongest dehortation from their wicked Intention that can be imagin'd but being not enough to reclaim them they answer'd  Nay but we will have a King  They were like to their Neighbors in folly and vice and would be like to them in Government which brought all the Calamitys upon them that the others suffer'd But I know not what conclusion can be drawn from hence in favor of our Author's Doctrin unless all Nations are oblig'd furiously to run into the same crimes with the  Israelites  or to take upon themselves the same punishment tho they do not commit the same crimes  If this was not a Precept to the  Israelites  instructing them what they should do but a denunciation of what they should suffer for the evil which they had committed the Old Testament will afford none and I hope in due time to answer such as he alledges from the New Nay we may conclude there can be none there because being dictated by the same Spirit which is always uniform and constant to it self it could not agree with the  th  of  Deuteron  which so extremely restrains such a King as God allow'd as not to suffer him in any manner to raise his heart above his Brethren and was said in vain if at the same time it gave him a Power which might not be resisted or forbad others to resist him if he would not obey the Law  To the third Whatsoever was done by the Command of God against  Pharaoh  King of  Egypt  and against the Kings of the  Cananites Midianites Moabites Edomites Amorites  or  Philistins  by  Moses Joshua  Ehud Barak Gideon Sampson Jephtha Samuel  and the rest of the Judges comes expresly under the particular Precepts and Examples promis'd by me to show that God had occasionally commanded and his Servants executed his Commands in resisting and destroying the Persons of Kings who were their own Kings also if Possession was only to be regarded And tho this be sufficient to overthrow our Author's Doctrin  That we are not to examin the Titles of Kings whether they be from usurpation or any other means but only to look upon the Power  Yet they who seek Truth ought not to content themselves merely with Victory or to esteem that a Victory which is obtain'd by what the Schools call  Argumentum ad hominem  grounded upon a false Proposition and is of no force except against those who are so ill advis'd to advance it Therefore laying aside the advantages that may be justly taken against  Filmer  for the folly of asserting the same Right to be in a Usurper as in a lawful Prince and confessing that tho such as have no Title may and ought to be supprest as Enemys and Robbers when respect and obedience is due to those who are rightly instituted I say that none can be claim'd by a Prince lawfully instituted if he assumes to himself a Power which is not granted to him by the Law of his Institution  Quia eat  nus non hab  t imperium  De Jur Bel  because as  Grotius  says  his legal Power does not extend so far  or turn the Power that is given him to ends contrary to those for which it was given because he thereby destroys it and puts himself into the same condition as if it had never bin This is prov'd by the Example of  Saul  Tho the people sinn'd grievously in asking a King yet God assenting to their demand no Prince was ever more solemnly instituted than he The People chose him by Lot from amongst all the Tribes and he was plac'd in the Throne by the general consent of the whole Nation But he turning his lawful Power into Tyranny disobeying the word of the Prophet slaying the Priests sparing the  Amalekites  and oppressing the Innocent overthrew his own Right and God declar'd the Kingdom which had bin given him under a conditional promise of perpetuity to be intirely abrogated This did not only give a right to the whole People of opposing him but to every particular man and upon this account  David  did not only fly from his fury but resisted it He made himself head of all the discontented Persons that would follow him he had at first four and afterwards six hundred men he kept these in Arms against  Saul  liv'd upon the Country and resolv'd to destroy  Nabal  with all his House only for refusing to send Provisions for his men Finding himself weak and unsafe he went to  Achish  the  Philistin  and offer'd his service even against  Israel  This was never reputed a sin in  David  or in those that follow'd him by any except the wicked Courtflatterer  Doeg  the  Edomite  and the drunken fool  Nabal  who is said to have bin a man of  Belial  If it be objected That this was rather a Flight than a War in as much as he neither kill'd  Saul  nor his men or that he made war as a King anointed by  Samuel  I answer that he who had six hundred men and entertain'd as many as came to him sufficiently shew'd his intention rather to resist than to fly And no other reason can be given why he did not farther pursue that intention than that he had no greater power and he who arms six hundred men against his Prince when he can have no more can no more be said to obey patiently than if he had so many  hundreds of thousands This holds tho he kills no man for that is not the War but the manner of making it and 'twere as absurd to say  David  made no War because he kill'd no men as that  Charles  the eighth made no War in  Italy  because  Guicciardin  says he conquer'd  Naples  without breaking a Lance But as  David  's strength increas'd he grew to be less sparing of Blood Those who say Kings never die but that the right is immediately transfer'd to the next Heirs cannot deny that  Ishbosheth  inherited the right of  Saul  and that  David  had no other right of making war against him than against  Saul  unless it were confer'd upon him by the Tribe of  Judah  that made him King If this be true it must be confest that not only a whole People but a part of them may at their own pleasure abrogate a Kingdom tho never so well establish'd by common consent for none was ever more solemnly instituted than that of  Saul  and few Subjects have more strongly oblig'd themselves to be obedient If it be not true the example of  Nabal  is to be follow'd and  David  tho guided by the Spirit of God deserves to be condemn'd as a fellow that rose up against his Master  If to elude this it be said That God instituted and abrogated  Saul  's Kingdom and that  David  to whom the right was transmitted might therefore proceed against him and his Heirs as privat men I answer that if the obedience due to  Saul  proceeded from God's Institution it can extend to none but those who are so peculiarly instituted and anointed by his Command and the hand of his Prophet which will be of little advantage to the Kings that can give no testimony of such an Institution or Unction and an indisputable right will remain to every Nation of abrogating the Kingdoms which are instituted by and for themselves But as  David  resisted the Authority of  Saul  and  Ishbosheth  without assuming the Power of a King tho design'd by God and anointed by the Prophet till he was made King of  Judah  by that Tribe or arrogating to himself a Power over the other Tribes till he was made King by them and had enter'd into a Covenant with them 'tis much more certain that the Persons and Authority of ill Kings who have no title to the Privileges due to  Saul  by virtue of his institution may be justly resisted which is as much as is necessary to my purpose  Sam  Object  But  David  's Heart smote him when he had cut off the skirt of  Saul  's Garment and he would not suffer  Abishai  to kill him This might be of some force if it were pretended that every man was oblig'd to kill an ill King whensoever he could do it which I think no man ever did say and no man having ever affirm'd it no more can be concluded than is confest by all But how is it possible that a man of a generous Spirit like  David  could see a great and valiant King chosen from amongst all the Tribes of  Israel  anointed by the command of God and the hand of the Prophet famous for victorys obtain'd against the enemys of  Israel  and a wonderful deliverance thereby purchas'd to that People cast at his feet to receive Life or Death from the hand of one whom he had so furiously persecuted and from whom he least deserv'd and could least expect mercy without extraordinary commotion of mind most especially when  Abishai  who saw all that he did and thereby ought best to have known his thoughts exprest so great a readiness to kill him This could not but make him reflect upon the instability of all that seem'd to be most glorious in men and shew him that if  Saul  who had bin nam'd even among the Prophets and assisted in an extraordinary manner to accomplish such great things was so abandon'd and given over to fury misery and shame  he that seem'd to be most firmly establish'd ought to take care lest he should fall  Surely these things are neither to be thought strange in relation to  Saul  who was God's Anointed nor communicable to such as are not Some may suppose he was King by virtue of God's unction tho if that were true he had never bin chosen and made King by the People but it were madness to think he became God's Anointed by being King for if that were so the same Right and Title would belong to every King even to those who by his command were accurs'd and destroy'd by his Servants  Moses Joshua  and  Samuel  The same men at the same time and in the same sense would be both his anointed and accurs'd lov'd and detested by him and the most sacred Privileges made to extend to the worst of his enemys  Again the War made by  David  was not upon the account of being King as anointed by  Samuel  but upon the common natural right of defending himself against the violence and fury of a wicked man he trusted to the promise  that he should be King  but knew that as yet he was not so and when  Saul  found he had spar'd his Life he said  I now know well that thou shalt surely be King and that the Kingdom of  Israel  shall surely be establish'd in thy hand  not that it was already Nay  David  himself was so far from taking upon him to be King till the Tribe of  Judah  had chosen him that he often acknowledg'd  Saul  to be his Lord When  Baanah  and  Rechab  brought the head of  Ishbosheth  to him he commanded them to be slain  Because they had kill'd a righteous man upon his Bed in  Sam  his own House  which he could not have said if  Ishbosheth  had unjustly detain'd from him the ten Tribes and that he had a right to reign over them before they had chosen him The Word of God did not make him King but only foretold that he should be King and by such ways as he pleas'd prepar'd the hearts of the People to set him up and till the time design'd by God for that work was accomplish'd he pretended to no other Authority than what the six hundred men who first follow'd him afterwards the Tribe of  Judah  and at last all the rest of the People confer'd upon him  I no way defend  Absalom  's revolt he was wicked and acted wickedly but after his death no man was ever blam'd or question'd for siding with him and  Amasa  who commanded his Army is represented in Scripture as a good man even  David  saying that  Joab  by slaying  Abner  and  Amasa  had kill'd  two men who were better than himself  which could  Sam ▪  not have bin unless the People had a right of looking into matters of Government and of redressing abuses tho being deceiv'd by  Absalom  they so far err'd as to prefer him who was in all respects wicked before the man who except in the matter of  Ʋriah  is said to be after God's own heart This right was acknowledg'd by  David  himself when he commanded  Hushai  to say to  Absalom I will be thy Servant O King  and by  Kings  Hushai  in the following Chapter  Nay but whom the Lord and his People and all the men of  Israel  chuse his will I be and with him will I abide  which could have no sense in it unless the People had a right of chusing and that the choice in which they generally concur'd was esteem'd to be from God  But if  Saul  who was made King by the whole People and anointed by the command of God might be lawfully resisted when he departed from the Law of his Institution it cannot be doubted that any other for the like reason may be resisted If  David  tho design'd by God to be  King and anointed by the hand of the Prophet was not King till the People had chosen him and he had made a Covenant with them it will if I mistake not be hard to find a man who can claim a right which is not originally from them And if the People of  Israel  could erect and pull down institute abrogate or transfer to other Persons or Familys Kingdoms more firmly establish'd than any we know the same right cannot be deny'd to other Nations  SECT II The Kings of  Israel  and  Judah  were under a Law not safely to be transgrest  OUR Author might be pardon'd if he only vented his own follys but he aggravates his crime by imputing them to men of more Credit and tho I cannot look upon Sir  Walter Raleigh  as a very good Interpreter of Scripture he had too much understanding to say  That if practice declare the greatness of Authority even the best Kings of  Israel  and  Judah  were not ty'd to any Law but they did whatsoever they pleas'd in the greatest matters  for there is no sense in those words  If Practice declares the greatness of Authority even the best of Kings were ty'd to no Law  signifies nothing for Practice cannot declare the greatness of Authority  Peter  the Cruel of  Castille  and  Christiern  the  d  of  Denmark  kill'd whom they pleas'd but no man ever thought they had therefore a right to do so and if there was a Law all were ty'd by it and the best were less likely to break it than the worst But if Sir  Walter Raleigh  's opinion which  L Hist c  he calls a conjecture be taken there was so great a difference between the Kings of  Israel  and  Judah  that as to their general proceedings in point of Power hardly any thing can be said which may rightly be apply'd to both and he there endeavours to show that the reason why the ten Tribes did not return to the house of  David  after the destruction of the houses of  Jeroboam  and  Baasha  was because they would not endure a Power so absolute as that which was exercis'd by the house of  David  If he has therefore any where said that the Kings did what they pleas'd it must be in the sense that  Moses Maimonides  says The Kings of  Israel  committed many extravagances because they were  Quia superbi erant corde impii spretores Legis  Mor Nevoch  insolent impious and despisers of the Law  But whatsoever Sir  Walter Raleigh  may say for I do not remember his words and have not leisure to seek whether any  ch are found in his Books 'tis most evident they did not what they pleas'd The Tribes that did not submit to  David  nor crown him till they thought fit and then made a Covenant with him took care it might be observ'd whether he would or not  Absalom  's Rebellion follow'd by almost all  Israel  was a terrible check to his Will That of  Sheba  the Son of  Bichri  was like to have bin worse if it had not bin supprest by  Joab  's diligence and  David  often confest the Sons of  Zerviah  were too hard for him  Solomon  indeed overthrowing the Law given by  Moses  multiplying Gold and Silver Wives and Horses introducing Idolatry  and lifting up his heart above his Brethren did what he pleas'd but  Rehoboam  paid for all the ten Tribes revolted from him by reason of the heavy burdens laid upon them ston'd  Adoram  who was sent to levy the Tributes and set up  Jeroboam  who as Sir  Walter Raleigh  says in the place before cited had no other Title than the courtesy of the People and utterly rejected the house of  David  If practice therefore declares a right the practice of the People to avenge the injurys they suffer'd from their Kings as soon as they found a man fit to be their Leader shews they had a right of doing it  'Tis true the best of the Kings with  Moses Joshua  and  Samuel  may in one sense be said to have done what they pleas'd because they desir'd to do that only which was good But this will hardly be brought to confer a right upon all Kings And I deny that even the Kings of  Judah  did what they pleas'd or that it were any thing to our question if they did  Zedekiah  profest to the great men that is to the  Sanhedrin that without  Jerem  them he could do nothing  When  Amaziah  by his folly had brought a great slaughter upon the Tribe of  Judah  they conspir'd against him in Publick Council whereupon he fled to  Lachish  and they pursuing him  Kings  thither kill'd him avow'd the Fact and it was neither question'd nor blam'd which examples agree with the paraphrase of  Josephus  on  Deut  Antiq Jud    He shall do nothing without the consent of the  Sanhedrin  and if he attempt it they shall hinder him  This was the Law of God not to be abrogated by Man a Law of Liberty directly opposite to the necessity of submitting to the will of a man This was a Gift bestow'd by God upon his Children and People whereas slavery was a great part of the Curse denounc'd against  Cham  for his wickedness and perpetually incumbent upon his Posterity The great  Sanhedrin  were constituted Judges as  Grotius  says most particularly of such matters as concern'd their Kings and  Maimonides  affirms that the Kings were judg'd by them The distribution of the power to the inferior  Sanhedrins  in every Tribe and City with the right of calling the People together in general Assemblys as often as occasion requir'd were the foundations of their Liberty and being added to the Law of the Kingdom prescrib'd in the  th  of  Deuteronomy  if they should think fit to have a King establish'd the Freedom of that People upon a solid foundation And tho in their fury they did in a great measure wave the benefits God had bestow'd upon 'em yet there was enough left to restrain the Lusts of their Kings  Ahab  did not treat with  Naboth  as with a Servant whose Person and Estate depended upon his Will and dos not seem to have bin so tenderhearted to grieve much for his refusal if by virtue of his Royal Authority he could have taken away his Vineyard and his Life But that failing he had no other way of accomplishing his design than by the fraud of his accursed Wife and the perfidious Wretches she imploy'd And no better proof that it did fail can reasonably be requir'd than that he was oblig'd to have recourse to such sordid odious and dangerous Remedys But we are furnish'd with one that is more unquestionable  Hast thou kill'd and also taken possession  Kings  In the place where Dogs lick'd the blood of  Naboth  shall they lick thy Blood even thine  This shews that the Kings were not only under a Law but under a Law of equality with the rest of the People even that of Retaliation He had rais'd his heart above his Brethren but God brought him down and made him to suffer what he had done he was in all respects wicked but the justice of this sentence consisted in the Law he had broken which could not have bin if he had bin subject to none But  as this Retaliation was the sum of all the Judicial Law given by God to his People the Sentence pronounc'd against  Ahab  in conformity to it and the execution committed to  Jehu  shews that the Kings were no less oblig'd to perform the Law than other men tho they were not so easily punish'd for transgressing it as others were and if many of them did escape it perfectly agrees with what had bin foretold by  Samuel  SECT III  Samuel  did not describe to the  Israelites  the glory of a free Monarchy but the Evils the People should suffer that he might divert them from desiring a King  THO no restraint had bin put upon the Hebrew Kings it could be no prejudice to any other Nation They deflected from the Law of God and rejecting him that he should reign over them no longer they fell into that misery which could affect none but those who enjoy the same Blessings and with the same fury despise them If their Kings had more Power than consisted with their welfare they gave it and God renounces the institution of  Ye have chosen Kings but not by me and Princes but I know them not  Hos  such He gave them a Law of Liberty and if they fell into the shame and misery that accompanys slavery it was their own work They were not oblig'd to have any King and could not without a crime have any but one who must not raise his heart above the rest of them This was taught by  Moses  And  Samuel  who spoke by the same Spirit could not contradict him and in telling the People what such a King as they desir'd would do when he should be establish'd he did announce to them the misery they would bring upon themselves by chusing such a one as he had forbidden This free Monarchy which our Author thinks to be so majestically describ'd was not only displeasing to the Prophet but declar'd by God to be a rejection of him and inconsistent with his reign over them This might have bin sufficient to divert any other people from their furious resolution but the Prophet farther enforcing his dissuasion told them that God who had in all other cases bin their helper would not hear them when they should cry to him by reason of their King This is the majestick description of that free Monarchy with which our Author is so much pleas'd It was displeasing to the Prophet hateful to God an aggravation of all the crimes they had committed since they came out of  Egypt  and that which would bring as it did most certain and irreparable destruction upon them  But it seems the Regal Majesty in that Age was in its infancy and little in comparison of that which we find describ'd by  Tacitus Suetonius  and others in later times He shall take your Sons says  Samuel  and set them over his Chariots and your Daughters to make them Confectioners and Cooks but the Majesty of the  Roman  Emperors was carry'd to a higher pitch of Glory  Ahab  could not without employing treachery and fraud get a small spot of ground for his mony to make a Garden of Herbs But  Tiberius Caligula  and  Nero  kill'd whom they pleas'd and took what they pleas'd of their Estates When they had satiated their cruelty and avarice by the murders and confiscations of the most eminent and best men they commonly expos'd their Children to the Lust of their Slaves If the power of doing evil be glorious the utmost excess is its perfection and 'tis pity that  Samuel  knew no more of the effects produc'd by unrestrain'd Lust that he might have made the description yet more majestick and as nothing can be suffer'd by man beyond constupration torments and death instead of such trifles as he mention'd he might have shew'd them the effects of Fury in its greatest exaltation  If it be good for a Nation to live under such a Power why did not God of his own goodness institute it Did his Wisdom and Love to his People fail or if he himself had not set up the best Government over them could he be displeas'd with them for asking it Did he separate that Nation from the rest of Mankind to make their condition worse than that of others Or can they be said to have sin'd and rejected God when they desir'd nothing but the Government which by a perpetual Ordinance he had establish'd over all the Nations of the World Is not the Law of Nature a Rule which he has given to things and the Law of man's Nature which is Reason an emanation of the divine Wisdom or some footsteps of divine Light remaining in us Is it possible that this which is from God can be contrary to his Will and can he be offended with those who desire to live in a conformity to that Law Or could it justly be said The People had chosen that which is not good if nothing in Government be good but what they chose  But as the worst men delight in the worst things and Fools are pleas'd with the most extreme absurditys our Author not only gives the highest praises to that which bears so many marks of God's hatred but after having said that  Abraham Isaac Jacob  and  Moses  were Kings he tells us  The  Israelites  beg'd a King of  Samuel which had bin impertinent if the Magistrats instituted by the Law were Kings and tho it might be a folly in them to ask what they had already it could be no sin to desire that which they enjoy'd by the Ordinance of God If they were not Kings it follows that the only Government set up by God amongst men wanted the principal part even the Head and Foundation from whence all the other parts have their action and being that is God's Law is against God's Law and destroys it self  But if God did neither by a general and perpetual Ordinance establish over all Nations the Monarchy which  Samuel  describes nor prescribe it to his own People by a particular Command it was purely the Peoples Creature the production of their own fancy conceiv'd in wickedness and brought forth in iniquity an Idol set up by themselves to their own destruction in imitation of their accursed Neighbours and their Reward was no better than the concession of an impious Petition which is one of God's heaviest Judgments  Samuel  's words are acknowledg'd by all Interpreters who were not malicious or mad to be a dissuasion from their wicked purpose not a description of what a King might justly do by virtue of his Office but what those who should be set up against God and his Law would do when they came to have the power in their hands And I leave such as have the understandings of men and are not abandon'd by God to judg what influence this ought to have upon other Nations either as to obligation or imitation  SECT IV No People can be oblig'd to suffer from their Kings what they have not a right to do  OUR Author's next work is to tell us That  the scope of  Samuel  was to teach the People a dutiful obedience to their King even in the things that they think mischievous or inconvenient For by telling them what the King would do he indeed instructs them what a Subject must suffer Yet not so that it is right for Kings to do injury but it is right for them to go unpunish'd by the People if they do it so that in this point it is all one whether  Samuel  describe a King or a Tyrant  This is hard but the Conclusion is grounded upon nothing There is no relation between a Prediction that a thing shall be attempted or done to me and a Precept that I shall not defend my self or punish the person that attempts or dos it If a Prophet should say that a Thief lay in the way to kill me it might reasonably persuade me not to go or to go in such a manner as to be able to defend my self but can no way oblige me to submit to the violence that shall be offer'd or my Friends and Children not to avenge my death if I fall much less can other men be depriv'd of the natural right of defending themselves by my imprudence or obstinacy in not taking the warning given whereby I might have preserv'd my life For every man has a right of resisting some way or other that which ought not to be done to him and tho human Laws do not in all cases make men Judges and Avengers of the Injurys offer'd to them I think there is none that dos not justify the man who kills another that offers violence to him if it appears that the way prescrib'd by the Law for the preservation of the Innocent cannot be taken This is not only true in the case of outrageous attempts to assassinate or rob on the high way but in divers others of less moment I knew a man who being appointed to keep his Master's Park kill'd three men in one night that came to destroy his Deer and putting himself into the hands of the Magistrate and confessing the Fact both in matter and manner he was at the publick Assizes not only acquitted but commended for having done his duty and this in a time when 'tis well known Justice was severely administer'd and little favor expected by him or his Master Nay all Laws must fall human Societys that subsist by them be dissolv'd and all innocent persons be expos'd to the violence of the most wicked if men might not justly defend themselves against injustice by their own natural right when the ways prescrib'd by publick Authority cannot be taken  Our Author may perhaps say this is true in all except the King And I desire to know why if it be true in all except the King it should not be true in relation to him Is it possible that he who is instituted for the obtaining of Justice should claim the liberty of doing Injustice as a Privilege Were it not better for a people to be without Law than that a Power should be establish'd by Law to commit all manner of violences with impunity Did not  David  resist those of  Saul  Did he not make himself head of the Tribe of  Judah  when they revolted against his Son and afterwards of the ten Tribes that rejected his Posterity  Did not the  Israelites  stone  Adoram  who collected the Taxes revolt from the House of  David  set up  Jeroboam  and did not the Prophet say it was from the Lord If it was from the Lord was it not good If it was good then is it not so for ever Did good proceed from one root then and from another now If God had aveng'd the Blood of  Naboth  by fire from Heaven and destroy'd the House of  Ahab  as he did the two Captains and their men who were sent to apprehend  Elijah  it might be said he reserv'd that vengeance to himself but he did it by the Sword of  Jehu  and the Army which was the People who had set him up for an Example to others  But 'tis good to examin what this  dutiful Obedience  is that our Author mentions Men usually owe no more than they receive 'Tis hard to know what the  Israelites  ow'd to  Saul David Jeroboam Ahab  or any other King whether good or bad till they were made Kings And the Actof the People by which so great a dignity was confer'd seems to have laid a duty upon them who did receive more than they had to give so that something must be due from them unless it were releas'd by virtue of a Covenant or Promise made and none could accrue to them from the people afterwards unless from the merit of the person in rightly executing his Office If a Covenant or Promise be pretended the nature and extent of the Obligation can only be known by the contents exprest or the true intention of it If there be a general form of Covenant set and agreed upon to which all Nations must submit it were good to know where it may be found and by whose Authority it is establish'd and then we may examin the sense of it If no such do appear we may rationally look upon those to be Impostors who should go about from thence to derive a right And as that which dos not appear is as if it were not we may justly conclude there is no other or none that can have any effect but such as have bin made by particular Nations with their Princes which can be of no force or obligation to others nor to themselves any farther than according to the true intention of those that made them There is no such thing therefore as a dutiful obedience or duty of being obedient incumbent upon all Nations by virtue of any Covenant nor upon any particular Nation unless it be exprest by a Covenant and whoever pretends to a right of taking our Sons and Daughters Lands or Goods or to go unpunish'd if he do must show that these things are exprest or intended by the Covenant  But tho Nations for the most part owe nothing to Kings till they are Kings and that it can hardly be conceiv'd that any people did ever owe so much to a man as might not be fully repaid by the honor and advantages of such an advancement yet 'tis possible that when they are made Kings they may by their good Government lay such Obligations upon their Subjects as ought to be recompens'd by obedience and service There is no mortal Creature that deserves so well from mankind as a wise valiant diligent and just King who as a Father cherishes his People as a Shepherd feeds defends and is ready to lay down his life for his flock who is a terror to evil doers and a praise to those that do well This is a glorious Prerogative and he who has it is happy But before this can be adjudg'd to belong to all it must be prov'd that all have the Vertues that deserve it and he that exacts the dutiful Obedience that arises from them must prove that they are in him He that dos this need not plead for impunity when he dos injurys for if he do them he is not the man we speak of Not being so he can have no title  to the duty by human Institution or Covenant nor by divine Law since as is already prov'd God has neither establish'd Kings over all Nations by Precept nor recommended them by Example in setting them over his own People He has not therefore done it at all there is no such thing in nature and Nations can owe nothing to Kings merely as Kings but what they owe by the Contract made with them  As these Contracts are made voluntarily without any previous obligation 'tis evident that men make them in consideration of their own good and they can be of force no longer than he with whom they are made perform his part in procuring it and that if he turn the power which was given to him for the publick good to the publick inconvenience and damage he must necessarily lose the benefit he was to receive by it The word  think  is foolishly and affectedly put in by our Author for those matters are very often so evident that even the weakest know them No great sagacity is requir'd to understand that leud slothful ignorant false unjust covetous and cruel Princes bring inconveniences and mischiefs upon Nations and many of them are so evidently guilty of some or all these Vices that no man can be mistaken in imputing them and the utmost Calamitys may rationally be expected from them unless a Remedy be apply'd  But says he  Samuel  by telling them  what the King would do instructs them what the Subjects must suffer and that 'tis right he should go unpunish'd  But by his favor  Samuel  says no such thing neither is it to be concluded that because a King will do wickedly he must be suffer'd any more than a private man who should take the same Resolution But he told them that  when they should cry to the Lord by reason of their King he would not hear them  This was as much as to say their ruin was unavoidable and that having put the power into the hands of those who instead of protecting would oppress them and thereby having provok'd God against them so as he would not hearken to their cries they could have no relief But this was no security to the Authors of their Calamity The Houses of  Jeroboam Baasha  and  Omri  escap'd not unpunish'd tho the People did not thereby recover their Liberty The Kings had introduc'd a Corruption that was inconsistent with it But they who could not settle upon a right Foundation to prevent future mischiefs could avenge such as they had suffer'd upon the heads of those who had caus'd 'em and frequently did it most severely The like besel the  Romans  when by the violence of Tyranny all good Order was overthrown good Disciplin extinguish'd and the People corrupted Ill Princes could be cut in pieces and mischiefs might be reveng'd tho not prevented But 'tis not so every where nor at all times and nothing is more irrational than from one or a few Examples to conclude a general necessity of future Events They alter according to Circumstances and as some Nations by destroying Tyrants could not destroy Tyranny others in removing the Tyrant have cut up Tyranny by the roots This variety has bin seen in the same Nation at different times The  Romans  recover'd their Liberty by expelling  Tarquin  but remain'd Slaves notwithstanding the slaughter of  Cesar  Whilst the Body of the People was uncorrupted they cur'd the Evil wrought by the Person in taking him away It was no hard matter to take the Regal Power that by one man had bin enjoy'd for life and to place it in the hands of two annual Magistrats whilst the Nobility and People were according to the condition of that Age strong and ready to maintain it But when the mischief had taken deeper root  when the best part of the people had perish'd in the Civil Wars when all their eminent men had fallen in battel or by the Proscriptions when their Disciplin was lost and Vertue abolish'd the poor remains of the distrest people were brought under the power of a mercenary Soldiery and found no relief When they kill'd one Tyrant they often made room for a worse It avail'd them nothing to cut off a rotten Branch whilst the accursed Root remain'd and sent forth new Sprouts of the same nature to their destruction Other generous Nations have bin subdu'd beyond a possibility of recovery and those that are naturally base slide into the like misery without the impulse of an exterior Power They are Slaves by nature and have neither the understanding nor courage that is requir'd for the constitution and management of a Government within themselves They can no more subsist without a Master than a flock without a Shepherd They have no comprehension of Liberty and can neither desire the good they do not know nor enjoy it if it were bestow'd upon them They bear all burdens and whatever they suffer they have no other remedy or refuge than in the mercy of their Lord But such Nations as are naturally strong stout and of good understanding whose vigor remains unbroken manners uncorrupted reputation unblemish'd and increasing in numbers who neither want men to make up such Armys as may defend 'em against foreign or domestick Enemys nor Leaders to head them do ordinarily set limits to their patience They know how to preserve their Liberty or to vindicate the violation of it and the more patient they have bin the more inflexible they are when they resolve to be so no longer Those who are so foolish to put them upon such courses do to their cost find there is a difference between Lions and Asses and he is a fool who knows not that  Ignorat{que} datos ne quisquam serviat enses  Lucan  Swords were given to men that none might be Slaves but such as know not how to use them  SECT V The Mischiefs suffer'd from wicked Kings are such as render it both reasonable and just for all Nations that have Vertue and Power to exert both in repelling them  IF our Author deserve credit we need not examin whether Nations have a right of resisting or a reasonable hope of succeeding in their endeavours to prevent or avenge the Mischiefs that are fear'd or suffer'd for 'tis not worth their pains  The Inconveniences  says he  and Miserys which are reckon'd up by  Samuel  as belonging to Kingly Government were not intolerable but such as have bin and still are born by the Subjects free consent from their Princes Nay at this day and in this Land many Tenants by their Tenures are ty'd unto the same subjection even unto subordinate and inferior Lords  He is an excellent Advocate for Kingly Government that accounts Inconveniences and Miserys to be some of the essentials of it which others esteem to be only incidents Tho many Princes are violent and wicked yet some have bin gentle and just tho many have brought misery upon Nations some have bin beneficial to them and they who are esteem'd most severe against Monarchy think the evils often  suffer'd under that form of Government proceed from the Corruption of it or deviation from the principle of its institution and that they are rather to be imputed to the vices of the Person than to the thing it self but if our Author speak truth it is universally and eternally naught inconvenience and misery belong to it  He thinks to mend this by saying they are not intolerable but what is intolerable if Inconveniences and Miserys be not For what end can he think Governments to have bin establish'd unless to prevent or remove Inconveniences and Miserys or how can that be call'd a Government which dos not only permit but cause them What can incline Nations to set up Governments Is it that they may suffer Inconveniences and be brought to misery or if it be to enjoy happiness how can that subsist under a Government which not by accident deflection or corruption but by a necessity inherent in it self causes Inconveniences and Miserys If it be pretended that no human Constitution can be altogether free from Inconveniences I answer that the best may to some degree fall into them because they may be corrupted but evil and misery can properly belong to none that is not evil in its own nature If  Samuel  deserve credit or may be thought to have spoken sense he could not have enumerated the evils which he foresaw the People should suffer from their Kings nor say that they should cry to the Lord by reason of them unless they were in themselves grievous and in comparison greater than what they had suffer'd or known since that would not have diverted them from their intention but rather have confirm'd 'em in it And I leave it to our Author to show why any People should for the pleasure of one or a few men erect or suffer that Government which brings more of evil with it than any other  Moreover there is a great difference between that which Nations sometimes suffer under Kings and that which they willingly suffer most especially if our Author's Maxim be receiv'd That all Laws are the Mandates of Kings and the Subjects Libertys and Privileges no more than their gracious Concessions for how patient soever they are under the Evils they suffer it might reasonably be believ'd they are so because they know not how to help it And this is certainly the case of too many places that are known to us Whoever doubts of this if he will not put himself to the trouble of going to  Turky  or  Morocco  let him pass only into  Normandy  and ask the naked barefooted and halfstarv'd people whether they are willing to suffer the Miserys under which they groan and whether the magnificence of  Versailles  and the pomp of their haughty Master do any way alleviate their Calamitys If this also be a matter of too much pains the Wretches that come hither every day will inform him that it is not by their own consent they are depriv'd of all Honors and Offices in the Commonwealth even of those which by a corrupt Custom that had gain'd the force of a Law they had dearly bought prohibited to exercise any trade expos'd to the utmost effects of fraud and violence if they refuse to adore their Master's Idols They will tell him that 'tis not willingly they leave their Lands and Estates to seek a shelter in the most remote parts of the World but because they are under a force which they are notable to resist and because one part of the Nation which is enrich'd with the Spoils of the other have foolishly contributed to lay a Yoke upon them which they cannot break  To what he says concerning Tenures I answer No man in  England  ows any service to his Lord unless by virtue of a Contract made by himself  or his Predecessors under which he holds the Land granted to him on that condition by the Proprietor There may be something of hardship but nothing of injustice 'Tis a voluntary act in the beginning and continuance and all men know that what is done to one who is willing  Volenti non fit injuria  is no injury He who did not like the Conditions was not oblig'd to take the Land and he might leave it if afterwards he came to dislike them If any man say the like may be done by any one in the Kingdom I answer That it is not always true the Protestants now in  France  cannot without extreme hazard go out of that Country tho they are contented to lose their Estates 'Tis accounted a Crime for which they are condemn'd perpetually to the Gallys and such as are aiding to them to grievous Fines But before this be acknowledg'd to have any similitude or relation to our discourse concerning Kings it must be prov'd that the present King or those under whom he claims is or were Proprietors of all the Lands in  England  and granted the several parcels under the condition of suffering patiently such Inconveniences and Miserys as are abovemention'd or that they who did confer the Crown upon any of them did also give a Propriety in the Land which I do not find in any of the fifteen or sixteen Titles that have bin since the coming in of the  Normans  and if it was not done to the first of every one it cannot accrue to the others unless by some new act to the same purpose which will not easily be produc'd  It will be no less difficult to prove that any thing unworthy of Freemen is by any Tenures impos'd in  England  unless it be the offering up of the Wives and Daughters of Tenants to the Lust of Abbots and Monks and they are so far from being willingly suffer'd that since the Dens and Nurserys of those Beasts were abolish'd no man that succeeds them has had impudence sufficient to exact the performance and tho the letter of the Law may favor them the turpitude of the thing has extinguish'd the usage  But even the Kings of  Israel  and  Judah  who brought upon the People those evils that had bin foretold by  Samuel  did not think they had a right to the Powers they exercis'd If the Law had given a right to  Ahab  to take the best of their Vineyards he might without ceremony have taken that of  Naboth  and by the majestick power of an absolute Monarch have chastis'd the churlish Clown who refus'd to sell or change it for another but for want of it he was oblig'd to take a very different course If the lives of Subjects had in the like manner depended on the will of Kings  David  might without scruple have kill'd  Ʋriah  rather than to place him in the front of the Army that he might fall by his own courage The malice and treachery of such Proceedings argues a defect of power and he that acts in such an oblique manner shews that his actions are not warranted by the Law which is boldly executed in the face of the Sun This shews the interpretation put upon the words  Against thee only have I sinn'd  by Courtflatterers to be false For if he had not sinn'd against  Bathsheba  whom he corrupted  Ʋriah  whom he caus'd to be kill'd the People that he scandaliz'd and the Law which he violated he had never endeavour'd to cover his guilt by so vile a fraud And as he did not thereby fly the sight of God but of men 'tis evident that in that action he fear'd men more than God  If by the Examples of  Israel  and  Judah  we may judg whether the Inconveniences and Miserys brought upon Nations by their Kings be tolerable or intolerable it will be enough to consider the madness of  Saul  's cruelty towards his Subjects and the slaughter brought upon them by the hand of the  Philistins  on Mount  Gilboa  where he fell with the flower of all  Israel  the Civil Wars that happen'd in the time of  David  and the Plague brought upon the People by his wickedness the heavy burdens laid upon them by  Solomon  and the Idolatry favor'd by him the wretched folly of  Rehoboam  and the defection of the ten Tribes caus'd by it the Idolatry establish'd by  Jeroboam  and the Kings of  Israel  with that of many of those of  Judah  also the frequent Wars and unheard of Slaughters ensuing thereupon between the Tribes the daily devastations of the Country by all sorts of Strangers the murders of the Prophets the abolition of God's Worship the desolation of Towns and Provinces the dispersion of the ten Tribes carry'd away into unknown Countrys and in the end the abolition of both Kingdoms with the captivity of the Tribe of  Judah  and the utter destruction of the City It cannot be said that these things were suffer'd under Kings and not from or by them for the desolation of the Citys People and Country is in many places of Scripture imputed to the Kings that taught  Israel  to sin as appears by  King King King  what was denounc'd against  Jeroboam Jehu Ahaz Manasseh Zedekiah  and others Nay the Captivity of  Babylon  with the evils ensuing were first announc'd to  Hezekiah  for his vanity and  Josiah  by the like brought a great slaughter upon himself and people But if mischiefs fell upon the People by the frailty of these who after  David  were the best nothing surely less than the utmost of all Miserys could be expected from such as were set to do evil and to make the Nation like to themselves in which they met with too great success  If it be pretended that God's People living under an extraordinary Dispensation can be no example to us I desire other Historys may be examin'd for I confess I know no Nation so great happy and prosperous nor any Power so well establish'd that two or three ill Kings immediatly succeeding each other have not bin able to destroy and bring to such a condition that it appear'd the Nations must perish unless the Senats Diets and other Assemblys of State had put a stop to the mischief by restraining or deposing them And tho this might be prov'd by innumerable Testimonys I shall only say that the Roman Empire perish'd by the vices corruption and baseness of their Princes the noble Kingdom of the  Goths  in  Spain  was overthrown by the Tyranny of  Witza  and  Rodrigo  the present state of  Spain  now languishes and threatens ruin from the same causes  France  was brought to the last degree of misery and weakness by the degenerate races of  Pharamond  and  Charles  to which may be added those of our own Country which are so well known that I need not mention them  SECT VI 'Tis not good for such Nations as will have Kings to suffer them to be glorious powerful or abounding in Riches  OUR Author having hitherto spoken of all Nations as born under a necessity of being subject to Absolute Monarchy which he pretends to have bin set up by the universal and indispensible Law of God and Nature now seems to leave to their discretion whether they will have a King or not but says that those  who will have a King are bound to allow him Royal Maintenance by providing Revenues for the Crown since it is for the Honor Profit and Safety of the People to have their King glorious powerful and abounding in Riches  If there be any thing of sense in this Clause there is nothing of truth in the foundation or principle of his whole Book For as the right and being of a Father is natural or inherent and no ways depending upon the will of the Child that of a King is so also if he be and ought to enjoy the Rights belonging to the Father of the People And 'tis not less ridiculous to say  those who will have a King  than it would be to say  he that will have a Father  for every one must have one whether he will or not But if the King be a Father as our Author from thence infers that all Laws are from him none can be impos'd upon him and whatsoever the Subject enjoys is by his concessions 'tis absurd to speak of an Obligation lying upon the people to allow him Royal maintenance by providing Revenues since he has all in himself and they have nothing that is not from him and depending upon his Will For this reason a worthy Gentleman of the House of Commons in the year desir'd that the business of the Judges who in the StarChamber had given for their Opinion concerning Shipmony  That in cases of Necessity the King might provide it by his own Authority and that he was Judg of that Necessity  might be first examin'd that they might know whether they had any thing to give before they should speak of giving And as 'tis certain that if the Sentence of those perjur'd Wretches had stood the Subjects of  England  by consequence would have bin sound to have nothing to give 'tis no less sure that if our Author's principle concerning the Paternal and Absolute Power of Kings be true it will by a more compendious way appear that it is not left to the choice of any Nation whether they will have a King or not for they must have him and can have nothing to allow him but must receive all from him  But if those only who  will have a King  are bound to have one and to allow this  Royal maintenance  such as will not have a King are by one and the same act deliver'd from the necessity of having one and from providing Maintenance for him which utterly overthrows the magnificent Fabrick of Paternal Monarchy and the Kings who were lately represented by our Author plac'd on the Throne by God and Nature and endow'd with an absolute Power over all appear to be purely the Creatures of the People and to have nothing but what is receiv'd from them  From hence it may be rationally infer'd that  Qui dat esse dat modum esse  he who makes a thing to be makes it to be only what he pleases This must hold in relation to Kings as well as other Magistrats and as they who made Consuls Dictators and Military Tribuns gave them only such Power and for such a time as best pleas'd themselves 'tis impossible they should not have the same right in relation to Kings in making them what they please as well as not to make them unless they please except there be a Charm belonging to the Name or the Letters that compose it which cannot belong to all Nations for they are different in every one according to the several Languages  But says our Author 'tis  for the Honor Profit and Safety of the People that the King should be glorious powerful and abounding in Riches  There is therefore no obligation upon them and they are to judg whether it be so or not The Scripture says plainly the contrary  He shall not multiply Silver and Gold Wives and Horses he shall not lift up his Heart above his Brethren  He shall not therefore be glorious powerful or abounding in Riches Reason and Experience teach us the same thing If those Nations that have bin proud luxurious and vicious have desir'd by Pomp and Riches to foment the Vices of their Princes thereby to cherish their own such as have excel'd in Vertue and good Disciplin have abhor'd it and except the immediate exercise of their Office have kept their supreme Magistrats to a manner of living little different from that of private men and it had bin impossible to maintain that frugality in which the integrity of their manners did chiefly consist if they had set up an Example directly contrary to it in him who was to be an Example to others or to provide for their own safety if they had overthrown that integrity of manners by which it could only be obtain'd and preserv'd There is a necessity incumbent upon every Nation that lives in the like Principle to put a stop to the entrance of those Vices that arise from the superfluity of Riches by keeping their Kings in that honest Poverty which is the Mother and Nurse of Modesty Sobriety and all manner of Vertue And no man can deny this to be well done unless he will affirm that Pride Luxury and Vice is more profitable to a Nation than the Vertues that are upheld by frugality  There is another reason of no less importance to those Nations who tho they think fit to have Kings yet desire to preserve their Liberty which obliges them to set limits to the Glory Power and Riches of their Kings and that is That they can no otherwise be kept within the Rules of the Law Men are naturally propense to corruption and if he whose Will and Interest it is to corrupt them be furnish'd with the means he will never fail to do it Power Honors Riches and the Pleasures that attend them are the baits by which men are drawn to prefer a personal Interest before the publick Good and the number of those who covet them is so great that he who abounds in them will be able to gain so many to his service as shall be sufficient to subdue the rest 'Tis hard to find a Tyranny in the world that has not bin introduc'd this way for no man by his own strength could ever subdue a multitude none could ever bring many to be subservient to his ill designs but by the rewards they receiv'd or hop'd By this means  Cesar  accomplish'd his work and overthrew the Liberty of his Country and with it all that was then good  in the world They who were corrupted in their minds desir'd to put all the Power and Riches into his hands that he might distribute them to such as serv'd him And he who was nothing less than covetous in his own nature desir'd Riches that he might gain Followers and by the plunder of  Gaul  he corrupted those that betray'd  Rome  to him And tho I do not delight to speak of the Affairs of our own time I desire those who know the present State of  France  to tell me whether it were possible for the King to keep that Nation under servitude if a vast Revenue did not enable him to gain so many to his particular service as are sufficient to keep the rest in subjection and if this be not enough let them consider whether all the dangers that now threaten us at home do not proceed from the madness of those who gave such a Revenue as is utterly unproportionable to the Riches of the Nation unsutable to the modest behaviour expected from our Kings and which in time will render Parliaments unnecessary to them  On the other hand the poverty and simplicity of the  Spartan  Kings was no less safe and profitable to the People than truly glorious to them  Agesilaus  deny'd that  Artaxerxes  was greater than he unless he were more temperate or more valiant and he made good his words so well that without any other assistance than what his Wisdom and Valor afforded he struck such a terror into that great rich powerful and absolute Monarch that he did not think himself safe in  Babylon  or  Ecbatane  till the poor  Spartan  was by a Captain of as great valor and greater poverty oblig'd to return from  Asia  to the defence of his own Country This was not peculiar to the severe  Laconic  Disciplin When the  Roman  Kings were expel'd a few Carts were prepar'd to transport their goods and their Lands which were consecrated to  Mars  and now go under the name of  Campus Martius  hardly contain ten Acres of ground Nay the Kings of  Israel  who led such vast Armys into the field that is were follow'd by all the people who were able to bear Arms seem to have possest little  Ahab  one of the most powerful was so fond of  Naboth  's Vineyard which being the Inheritance of his Fathers according to their equal division of Lands could not be above two Acres that he grew sick when it was refus'd  But if an allowance is to be made to every King it must be either according to a universal Rule or Standard or must depend upon the Judgment of Nations If the first they who have it may do well to produce it if the other every Nation proceeding according to the measure of their own discretion is free from blame  It may also be worth observation whether the Revenue given to a King be in such manner committed to his care that he is oblig'd to employ it for the publick Service without the power of Alienation or whether it be granted as a Propriety to be spent as he thinks fit When some of the antient Jews and Christians scrupled the paiment of Tribute to the Emperors the reasons alledg'd to persuade them to a compliance seem to be grounded upon a supposition of the first for said they the defence of the State lies upon them which cannot be perform'd without Armys and Garisons these cannot be maintain'd without pay nor mony rais'd to pay them without Tributes and Customs This carrys a face of reason with it especially in those Countrys which are perpetually or frequently subject to Invasions but this will not content our Author He speaks of employing the revenue in keeping the Kings House and looks upon it as a propriety to be spent as he thinks convenient which is no less  than to cast it into a Pit of which no man ever knew the bottom That which is given one day is squander'd away the next The people are always opprest with Impositions to foment the Vices of the Court These daily increasing they grow insatiable and the miserable Nations are compel'd to hard Labor in order to satiate those Lusts that tend to their own ruin  It may be consider'd that the vertuous  Saevior armis  Luxuria incubuit victum{que} ulciscitur orbem  Lucan  Pagans by the light of Nature discover'd the truth of this Poverty grew odious in  Rome  when great men by desiring Riches put a value upon them and introduc'd that pomp and luxury which could not be born by men of small Fortunes  Nullum crimen abest facinus{que} libidinis ex quo  Paupertas Romana perit  Juvenal  From thence all furys and mischiefs seem'd to break loose The base slavish and so often subdu'd  Asia  by the basest of men reveng'd the defeats they had receiv'd from the bravest and by infusing into them a delight in pomp and luxury in a short time render'd the strongest and bravest of Nations the weakest and basest I wish our own experience did not too plainly manifest that these Evils were never more prevalent than in our days when the luxury majestick pomp and absolute power of a neighbouring King must be supported by an abundance of Riches torn out of the bowels of his Subjects which renders them in the best Country of the World and at a time when the Crown most flourishes the poorest and most miserable of all the Nations under the Sun We too well know who are most apt to learn from them and by what means and steps they endeavour to lead us into the like misery But the Bird is safe when the Snare is discover'd and if we are not abandon'd by God to destruction we shall never be brought to consent to the settling of that Pomp which is against the practice of all vertuous people and has brought all the Nations that have bin taken with it into the ruin that is intended for us  SECT VII When the  Israelites  ask'd for such a King as the Nations about them had they ask'd for a Tyrant tho they did not call him so  NOW that  Saul  was no Tyrant  says our Author  note that the people ask'd a King as all Nations had God answers and bids  Samuel  to hear the voice of the People in all things which they spake and appoint them a King They did not ask a Tyrant and to give them a Tyrant when they ask'd a King had not bin to hear their voice in all things but rather when they ask'd an Egg to have given them a Scorpion unless we will say that all Nations had Tyrants  But before he drew such a Conclusion he should have observ'd that God did not give them a Scorpion when they ask'd an Egg but told them that was a Scorpion which they call'd an Egg They would have a King to judg them to go out before them and to fight their Battels but God in effect told them he would overthrow all Justice  and turn the Power that was given him to the ruin of them and their Posterity But since they would have it so he commanded  Samuel  to hearken to their Voice and for the punishment of their sin and folly to give them such a King as they ask'd that is one who would turn to his own profit and their misery the Power with which he should be entrusted and this truly denominates a Tyrant  Aristotle  makes no other distinction between a King and a Tyrant than that  the King governs for the good of the People the Tyrant for his own pleasure or profit  and they who ask'd such a one ask'd a Tyrant tho they call'd him a King This is all could be done in their Language for as they who are skill'd in the Oriental Tongues assure me there is no name for a Tyrant in any of them or any other way of expressing the thing than by circumlocution and adding proud insolent lustful cruel violent or the like Epithets to the word Lord or King They did in effect ask a Tyrant They would not have such a King as God had ordain'd but such a one as the Nations had Not that all Nations had Tyrants but those who were round about them of whom they had knowledg and which in their manner of speaking went under the name of all were blest with such Masters This way of expression was us'd by  Lot  's Daughters who said There was not a man in all the earth to come in to them because there was none in the neighborhood with whom it was thought fit they should accompany Now that the Eastern Nations were then and are still under the Government of those which all free People call Tyrants is evident to all men God therefore in giving them a Tyrant or rather a Government that would turn into Tyranny gave them what they ask'd under another name and without any blemish to the Mercy promis'd to their Fathers suffer'd them to bear the penalty of their wickedness and folly in rejecting him that he should not reign over them  But tho the name of Tyrant was unknown to them yet in  Greece  from whence the word comes it signify'd no more than one who govern'd according to his own will distinguish'd from Kings that govern'd by Law and was not taken in an ill sense till those who had bin advanc'd for their Justice Wisdom and Valor or their Descendents were found to depart from the ends of their Institution and to turn that Power to the oppression of the people which had bin given for their protection But by these means it grew odious and that kind of Government came to be thought only tolerable by the basest of men and those who destroy'd it were in all places esteem'd to be the best  If Monarchy had bin universally evil God had not in the  th  of  Deuteronomy  given leave to the  Israelites  to set up a King and if that kind of King had bin ask'd he had not bin displeas'd and they could not have bin said to reject God if they had not ask'd that which was evil for nothing that is good is contrary or inconsistent with a peoples obedience to him The Monarchy they ask'd was displeasing to God it was therefore evil But a Tyrant is no more than an evil or corrupted Monarch The King therefore that they demanded was a Tyrant God in granting one who would prove a Tyrant gave them what they ask'd and that they might know what they did and what he would be he told 'em they rejected him and should cry by reason of the King they desir'd  This denotes him to be a Tyrant for as the Government of a King ought to be gentle and easy tending to the good of the people resembling the tender care of a Father to his Family if he who is set up to be a  King and to be like to that Father dos lay a heavy Yoke upon the people and use them as Slaves and not as Children he must renounce all resemblance of a Father and be accounted an Enemy  But  says our Author  whereas the peoples crying argues some tyrannical oppression we may remember that the peoples Crys are not always an Argument of their living under a Tyrant No man will say  Solomon  was a Tyrant yet all the Congregation complain'd that  Solomon  made their Yoke grievous  'Tis strange that when Children nay when Whelps cry it should be accounted a mark that they are troubled and that the Cry of the whole People should be none Or that the Government which is erected for their ease should not be esteem'd tyrannical if it prove grievous to those it should relieve But as I know no example of a People that did generally complain without cause our Adversarys must alledg some other than that of  Solomon  before I believe it of any We are to speak reverently of him He was excellent in Wisdom he built the Temple and God appear'd twice to him But it must be confest that during a great part of his life he acted directly contrary to the Law given by God to Kings and that his ways were evil and oppressive to the people if those of God were good Kings were forbidden to multiply Horses Wives Silver and Gold But he brought together more Silver and Gold and provided more Horses Wives and Concubines than any man is known to have had And tho he did not actually return to  Egypt  yet he introduc'd their abominable Idolatry and so far rais'd his heart above his Brethren that he made them subservient to his Pomp and Glory The People might probably be pleas'd with a great part of this but when the Yoke became grievous and his foolish Son would not render it more easy they threw it off and the thing being from the Lord it was good unless he be evil  But as just Governments are establish'd for the good of the governed and the  Israelites  desir'd a King that it might be well with them not with him who was not yet known to them that which exalts one to the prejudice of those that made him must always be evil and the People that suffers the prejudice must needs know it better than any other He that denies this may think the state of  France  might have bin best known from  Bulion  the late Treasurer who finding  Lewis  the Thirteenth to be troubled at the peoples misery told him they were too happy since they were not reduc'd to eat grass But if words are to be understood as they are ordinarily us'd and we have no other than that of  Tyranny  to express a Monarchy that is either evil in the institution or fallen into corruption we may justly call that  Tyranny  which the Scripture calls a  grievous Yoke  and which neither the old nor the new Counsellors of  Rehoboam  could deny to be so for tho the first advis'd him to promise amendment and the others to do worse yet all agreed that what the people said was true  This Yoke is always odious to such as are not by natural stupidity and baseness fitted for it but those who are so never complain An Ass will bear a multitude of blows patiently but the least of them drives a Lion into rage He that said the rod is made for the back of fools confest that oppression will make a wise man mad And the most unnatural of all oppressions is to use Lions like Asses and to lay that Yoke upon a generous Nation which only the basest can deserve and for want of a better word we call this Tyranny  Our Author is not contented to vindicate  Solomon  only but extends his Indulgence to  Saul  His custom is to patronize all that is detestable and no better testimony could be given of it  It is true  says he  Saul lost his  Kingdom but not for being too cruel or tyrannical to his Subjects but for being too merciful to his Enemys  But he alledges no other reason than that the slaughter of the Priests is not blam'd not observing that the Writers of the Scripture in relating those things that are known to be abominable by the Light of Nature frequently say no more of them And if this be not so  Lot  's drunkenness and incest  Reuben  's pollution of his Father's bed  Abimelech  's slaughter of his seventy Brothers and many of the most wicked Acts that ever were committed may pass for laudable and innocent But if  Saul  were not to be blam'd for killing the Priests why was  David  blam'd for the death of  Thou hast killed  Uriah  with the Sword of the Children of  Ammon  Now therefore the Sword shall never depart from thy House  Sam  Ʋriah  Why were the Dogs to lick the blood of  Ahab  and  Jezebel  if they did nothing more than Kings might do without blame Now if the slaughter of one man was so severely aveng'd upon the Authors and their Familys none but such as  Filmer  can think that of so many innocent men with their Wives and Children could escape unreprov'd or unpunish'd But the whole series of the History of  Saul  shewing evidently that his Life and Reign were full of the most violent cruelty and madness we are to seek no other reason for the ruin threaten'd and brought upon him and his Family And as those Princes who are most barbarously savage against their own people are usually most gentle to the Enemys of their Country he could not give a more certain testimony of his hatred to those he ought to have protected than by preserving those Nations who were their most irreconcilable Enemies This is prov'd by reason as well as by experience for every man knows he cannot bear the hatred of all mankind Such as know they have Enemys abroad endeavour to get Friends at home Those who command powerful Nations and are belov'd by them fear not to offend Strangers But if they have render'd their own people Enemys to them they cannot hope for help in a time of distress nor so much as a place of retreat or refuge unless from strangers nor from them unless they deserve it by favoring them to the prejudice of their own Country As no man can serve two Masters no man can pursue two contrary Interests  Moses Joshua Gideon  and  Samuel  were severe to the  Amorites Midianites  and  Cananites  but mild and gentle to the  Hebrews Saul  who was cruel to the  Hebrews  spar'd the  Amalekites  whose preservation was their destruction and whilst he destroy'd those he should have sav'd and sav'd those that by a general and particular command of God he should have destroy'd he lost his ill govern'd Kingdom and left an example to posterity of the end that may be expected from pride folly and tyranny  The matter would not be much alter'd if I should confess that in the time of  Saul  all Nations were govern'd by Tyrants tho it is not true for  Greece  did then flourish in Liberty and we have reason to believe that other Nations did so also for tho they might not think of a good Government at the first nothing can oblige men to continue under one that is bad when they discover the evils of it and know how to mend it They who trusted men that appear'd to have great Vertues with such a power as might easily be turn'd into Tyranny might justly retract limit or abolish it when they found it to be abus'd And tho no condition had bin reserv'd the publick Good which is the end of all  Salus populi suprema Lex  Government  had bin sufficient to abrogate all that should tend to the contrary As the malice of Men and their Inventions to do mischief increase daily all would soon be brought under the power of the worst if care were not taken and opportunitys embrac'd to find new ways of preventing it He that should make War at this day as the best Commanders did two hundred years past would be beaten by the meanest Soldier The Places then accounted impregnable are now slighted as indefensible and if the Arts of defending were not improv'd as well as those of assaulting none would be able to hold out a day Men were sent into the World rude and ignorant and if they might not have us'd their natural Facultys to find out that which is good for themselves all must have bin condemn'd to continue in the ignorance of our first Fathers and to make no use of their understanding to the ends for which it was given  The bestial Barbarity in which many Nations especially of  Africa America  and  Asia  do now live shews what human Nature is if it be not improv'd by Art and Disciplin and if the first errors committed thro ignorance might not be corrected all would be oblig'd to continue in them and for any thing I know we must return to the Religion Manners and Policy that were found in our Country at  Cesar  's landing To affirm this is no less than to destroy all that is commendable in the world and to render the understanding given to men utterly useless But if it be lawful for us by the use of that understanding to build Houses Ships and Forts better than our Ancestors to make such Arms as are most fit for our defence and to invent Printing with an infinite number of other Arts beneficial to mankind why have we not the same right in matters of Government upon which all others do almost absolutely depend If men are not oblig'd to live in Caves and hollow Trees to eat Acorns and to go naked why should they be for ever oblig'd to continue under the same form of Government that their Ancestors happen'd to set up in the time of their ignorance Or if they were so ignorant to set up one that was not good enough for the age in which they liv'd why should it not be alter'd when tricks are found out to turn that to the prejudice of Nations which was erected for their good From whence should malice and wickedness gain a privilege of putting new Inventions to do mischief every day into practice and who is it that so far protects them as to forbid good and innocent men to find new ways also of defending themselves If there be any that do this they must be such as live in the same principle who whilst they pretend to exercise Justice provide only for the indemnity of their own Crimes and the advancement of unjust designs They would have a right of attacking us with all the advantages of the Arms now in use and the Arts which by the practice of so many ages have bin wonderfully refin'd whilst we should be oblig'd to employ no others in our just defence than such as were known to our naked Ancestors when  Cesar  invaded them or to the  Indians  when they fell under the dominion of the  Spaniards  This would be a compendious way of placing uncontrol'd Iniquity in all the Kingdoms of the World and of overthrowing all that deserves the name of Good by the introduction of such accursed Maxims But if no man dares to acknowledg any such except those whose acknowledgment is a discredit we ought not to suffer them to be obliquely obtruded upon us nor to think that God has so far abandon'd us into the hands of our Enemys as not to leave us the liberty of using the same Arms in our defence as they do to offend and injure us  We shall be told that Prayers and Tears were the only Arms of the first Christians and that Christ commanded his Disciples to pray for those that persecuted them But besides that those Precepts of the most extreme lenity do ill sute with the violent practices of those who attempt to enslave Nations and who by alledging them do plainly shew either that they do not extend to all Christians or that they themselves are none whilst they act contrary to them they are to know that those Precepts were merely temporary and directed to the Persons of the Apostles who were arm'd only with the sword of the Spirit that the Primitive Christians us'd Prayers and Tears only no longer than whilst they had no other arms But knowing that by listing themselves under the ensigns of Christianity they had not lost the rights belonging to all Mankind when Nations came to be converted they no way thought themselves oblig'd to give their Enemys a certain opportunity of destroying them when God had put means into their hands of defending themselves and proceeded so far in this way that the Christian Valor soon became no less famous and remarkable than that of the Pagans They did with the utmost vigor defend both their civil and religious Rights against all the Powers of Earth and Hell who by force and fraud endeavour'd to destroy them  SECT VIII Under the name of Tribute no more is understood than what the Law of each Nation gives to the supreme Magistrate for the defraying of publick Charges to which the Customs of the  Romans  or sufferings of the  Jews  have no relation  IF any desire the directions of the New Testament  says our Author  he may find our Saviour limiting and distinguishing Royal Power by giving to  Cesar  those things that are  Cesar  's and to God the things that are God's  But that will be of no advantage to him in this contest We do not deny to any man that which is his due but do not so well know who is  Cesar  nor what it is that can truly be said to be due to him I grant that when those words were spoken the power of the  Romans  exercis'd by  Tiberius  was then exprest by the name of  Cesar  which he without any Title had assum'd The  Jews  amongst many other Nations having bin subdu'd submitted to it and being no way competent Judges of the rights belonging to the Senat or People of  Rome  were oblig'd to acknowledg that Power which their Masters were under They had no Commonwealth of their own nor any other Government among themselves that was not precarious They thought Christ was to have restor'd their Kingdom and by them to have reign'd over the Nations but he shew'd them they were to be subject to the  Gentiles  and that within few years their City and Temple should be destroy'd Their Commonwealth must needs expire when all that was prefigur'd by it was accomplish'd It was not for them at such a time to presume upon their abrogated Privileges nor the Promises made to them which were then fulfil'd Nay they had by their Sins profan'd themselves and given to the  Gentiles  a right over them which none could have had if they had continu'd in their obedience to the Law of God This was the foundation of the  Cesars  dominion  over them but can have no influence upon us The first of the  Cesars  had not bin set up by them The series of them had not bin continu'd by their consent They had not interrupted the succession by placing or displacing such as they pleas'd They had not brought in Strangers or Bastards nor prefer'd the remotest in blood before the nearest They had no part in making the Laws by which they were govern'd nor had the  Cesars  sworn to them They had no  Great Charter  acknowledging their Libertys to be innate or inherent in them confirm'd by immemorial Custom and strengthen'd by thirty acts of their own general Assemblys with the assent of the  Romans  The  Cesar  who then govern'd came not to the power by their consent The question  Will ye have this man to reign  had never bin ask'd but he being impos'd upon them they were to submit to the Laws by which he govern'd their Masters This can be nothing to us whose case is in every respect most unlike to theirs We have no Dictatorian Power over us and neither we nor our Fathers have render'd or ow'd obedience to any human Laws but our own nor to any other Magistracy than what we have establish'd We have a King who reigns by Law His power is from the  Lex facit ut sit Rex  Bracton  Law that makes him King  and we can know only from thence what he is to command and what we are oblig'd to obey We know the power of the  Cesars  was usurp'd maintain'd and exercis'd with the most detestable violence injustice and cruelty But tho it had bin establish'd by the consent of the  Romans  from an opinion that it was good for them in that state of affairs it were nothing to us and we could be no more oblig'd to follow their example in that than to be govern'd by Consuls Tribuns and  Decemviri  or to constitute such a Government as they set up when they expel'd their Kings Their Authority was as good at one time as at the other or if a difference ought to be made the preference is to be given to what they did when their Manners were most pure the People most free and when Vertue was most flourishing among them But if we are not oblig'd to set up such a Magistracy as they had 'tis ridiculous to think that such an obedience is due to one who is not in being as they paid to him that was And if I should confess that  Cesar  holding the Senat and People of  Rome  under the power of the Sword impos'd what tribute he pleas'd upon the Provinces and that the  Jews  who had no part in the Government were oblig'd to submit to his will our liberty of paying nothing except what the Parliament appoints and yielding obedience to no Laws but such as are made to be so by their Authority or by our own immemorial Customs could not be thereby infring'd But we may justly affirm that the Tribute impos'd was not as our Author infers  all their Coin  nor a considerable part of it nor more than what was understood to go for the defraying of the publick Charges Christ by asking whose Image and Superscription was stampt upon their Mony and thereupon commanding them to give to  Cesar  that which was  Cesar  's did not imply that all was his but that  Cesar  's Mony being current amongst them it was a continual and evident testimony that they acknowledg'd themselves to be under his jurisdiction and therefore could not refuse to pay the Tribute laid upon them by the same Authority as other Nations did  It may also be observ'd that Christ did not so much say this to determin the questions that might arise concerning  Cesar  's Power for he plainly  says that was not his work but to put the  Pharisees  to silence who tempted him According to the opinion of the  Jews  that the Messias would restore the Kingdom of  Israel  they thought his first work would be to throw off the  Roman  Yoke and not believing him to be the man they would have brought him to avow the thing that they might destroy him But as that was not his business and that his time was not yet come it was not necessary to give them any other answer than such as might disappoint their purpose This shews that without detracting from the honor due to  Austin Ambrose  or  Tertullian  I may justly say that the decision of such questions as arise concerning our Government must be decided by our Laws and not by their Writings They were excellent Men but living in another time under a very different Government and applying themselves to other matters they had no knowledg at all of those that concern us They knew what Government they were under and thereupon judg'd what a broken and dispers'd People ow'd to that which had given Law to the best part of the World before they were in being under which they had bin educated and which after a most cruel persecution was become propitious to them They knew that the Word of the Emperor was a Law to the Senat and People who were under the power of that man that could get the best Army but perhaps had never heard of such mix'd Governments as ours tho about that time they began to appear in the world And it might be as reasonably concluded that there ought to be no rule in the Succession or Election of Princes because the  Roman  Emperors were set up by the violence of the Soldiers and for the most part by the slaughter of him who was in possession of the Power as that all other Princes must be absolute when they have it and do what they please till another more strong and more happy may by the like means wrest the same Power from them  I am much mistaken if this be not true but without prejudice to our Cause we may take that which they say according to their true meaning in the utmost extent And to begin with  Tertullian  'Tis good to consider the subject of his Discourse and to whom he wrote The Treatise cited by our Author is the  Apologetick  and tends to persuade the Pagans that Civil Magistrats might not intermeddle with Religion and that the Laws made by them touching those matters were of no value as relating to things of which they had no cognizance  Leges non annorum numerus nec conditorum dignitas sed sola aequitas commendat at{que} ideo si iniquae cognoscuntur merito damnantur  Tertul Ap  'Tis not  says he  length of time nor the dignity of the Legislators but equity only that can commend Laws and when any are found to be unjust they are deservedly condemn'd  By which words he deny'd that the Magistratical Power which the  Romans  acknowledg'd in  Cesar  had any thing to do in spiritual things And little advantage can be taken by Christian Princes from what he says concerning the  Roman  Emperors for he expresly declares  Sed Caesares super Christo credidissent si aut Caesares non essent saeculo necessarii aut Christiani potuissent esse Caesares  Ibid  That the  Cesars  would have believ'd in Christ if they had either not bin necessary to the secular Government or that Christians might have bin  Cesars This seems to have proceeded from an opinion receiv'd by Christians in the first Ages that the use of the Civil as well as the Military Sword was  equally accurs'd That  Christians were to be  Filii pacis nullius hostes Christus exarmando Petrum omnem Christianum militem in  aeteranum discinxit  Tertul ibid  Sons of peace Enemys to no man and that Christ by commanding  Peter  to put up his Sword did for ever disarm all Christians  He proceeds to say  Nobis omnis gloriae dignitatis ardore frigentibus c Nec alia res est nobis magis aliena quam publica Unam nobis Rempublicam Mundum agnoscimus  Ibid  We cannot fight to defend our Goods having in our Baptism renounc'd the World and all that is in it nor to gain Honors accounting nothing more foreign to us than publick Affairs and acknowledging no other Commonwealth than that of the whole World nor to save our lives because we account it a happiness to be kill'd  He dissuades the  Pagans  from executing Christians rather from charity to them in keeping them from the crime of slaughtering the Innocent than that they were unwilling to suffer and gives no other reasons of their Prayers for the Emperors than that they were commanded to love their Enemys and to pray for those who persecuted them except such as he drew from a mistake that the World was shortly to finish with the dissolution of the Empire All his Works as well those that were written before he fell into Montanism as those publish'd afterwards are full of the like Opinions and if  Filmer  acknowledges them to be true he must confess That Princes are not Fathers but  Qui enim magis inimici Christianorum quam de quorum Majestate conv  nimur in crimen  Ibid  Enemys and that not only they but all those who render themselves Ministers of the Powers they execute in taking upon them the Sword that Christ had curs'd do renounce him and we may consider how to proceed with such as do so If our Author will not acknowledg this then no man was ever guilty of a more vile prevarication than he who alledges those words in favor of his Cause which have their only strength in Opinions that he thinks false and in the Authority of a man whom in that very thing he condemns and must do so or overthrow all that he endeavours to support But  Tertullian  's Opinions concerning these matters have no relation to our present Question The design of his Apology and the Treatise to  Scapula  almost upon the same subject was to show that the Civil Magistracy which he comprehends under the name of  Cesar  had nothing to do with matters of Religion and that as no man could be a Christian who would undertake the work of a Magistrate they who were jealous the publick Offices might be taken out of their hands had nothing to fear from Christians who resolv'd not to meddle with them Whereas our question is only Whether that Magistratical Power which by Law or Usurpation was then in  Cesar  must necessarily in all times and in all places be in one man or may be divided and balanc'd according to the Laws of every Country concerning which he says nothing Or whether we who do not renounce the use of the Civil or Military Sword who have a part in the Government and think it our duty to apply our selves to publick Cares should lay them aside because the antient Christians every hour expecting death did not trouble themselves with them  If  Ambrose  after he was a Bishop employ'd the ferocity of a Soldier which he still retain'd rather in advancing the power of the Clergy than the good of Mankind by restraining the rage of Tyrants it can be no prejudice to our Cause of which he had no cognisance He spoke of the violent and despotical Government to which he had bin a Minister  before his Baptism and seems to have had no knowledg of the  Gothick  Polity that within a few years grew famous by the overthrow of the  Roman  Tyranny and delivering the world from the Yoke which it could no longer bear And if  Austin  might say That  the Emperor is subject to no Laws because he has a Power of making Laws  I may justly say that our Kings are subject to Laws because they can make no Law and have no Power but what is given by the Laws If this be not the case I desire to know who made the Laws to which they and their Predecessors have sworn and whether they can according to their own will abrogate those antient Laws by which they are made to be what they are and by which we enjoy what we have or whether they can make new Laws by their own Power If no man but our Author have impudence enough to assert any such thing and if all the Kings we ever had except  Richard  the second did renounce it we may conclude that  Austin  's words have no relation to our dispute and that 'twere to no purpose to examin whether the Fathers mention any reservation of Power to the Laws of the Land or to the People it being as lawful for all Nations if they think fit to frame Governments different from those that were then in being as to build Bastions Halfmoons Hornworks Ravelins or Counterscarps or to make use of Muskets Cannon Mortars Carabines or Pistols which were unknown to them  What  Solomon  says of the  Hebrew  Kings dos as little concern us We have already prov'd their Power not to have bin absolute tho greater than that which the Law allows to ours It might upon occasion be a prudent advice to private persons living under such Governments as were usual in the Eastern Countrys  to keep the King's Commandments and not to say What dost thou because where the Word of a King is there is Power and all that he pleaseth he will do  But all these words are not his and those that are must not be taken in a general sense for tho his Son was a King yet in his words there was no power He could not do what he pleas'd nor hinder others from doing what they pleas'd He would have added weight to the Yoke that lay upon the necks of the  Israelites  but he could not and we do not find him to have bin master of much more than his own Tongue to speak as many foolish things as he pleas'd In other things whether he had to deal with his own people or with strangers he was weak and impotent and the wretches who flatter'd him in his follys could be of no help to him The like has befallen many others Those who are wise vertuous valiant just and lovers of their People have and ought to have Power but such as are leud vicious foolish and haters of their People ought to have none and are often depriv'd of all This was well known to  Solomon  who says That  a wise Child is better than an old and foolish King that will not be advis'd  When  Nabuchodonosor  set himself in the place of God his Kingdom was taken from him and he was driven from the society of men to herd with beasts There was Power for a time in the word of  Nero  he murder'd many excellent men but he was call'd to account and the World abandon'd the Monster it had too long endur'd He found none to defend him nor any better help when he desir'd to die than the hand of a Slave Besides some Kings by their Institution have little Power some have bin depriv'd of what they had for abusing or rendring themselves unworthy of it and Historys afford us innumerable examples of both sorts  But tho I should confess that there is always Power in the word of a King it would be nothing to us who dispute concerning Right and have no regard to that Power which is void of it A Thief or a Pyrat may have Power but that avails him not when as often befel the  Cesars  he meets with one who has more and is always unsafe since having no effect upon the Consciences of men every one may destroy him that can And I leave it to Kings to consider how much they stand oblig'd to those who placing their Rights upon the same foot expose their Persons to the same dangers  But if Kings desire that in their Word there should be power let them take care that it be always accompany'd with Truth and Justice Let them seek the good of their People and the hands of all good men will be with them Let them not exalt themselves insolently and every one will desire to exalt them Let them acknowledg themselves to be the Servants of the Publick and all men will be theirs Let such as are most addicted to them talk no more of  Cesars  nor the Tributes due to them We have nothing to do with the name of  Cesar  They who at this day live under it reject the Prerogatives antiently usurp'd by those who had it and are govern'd by no other Laws than their own We know no Law to which we owe obedience but that of God and our selves  Asiatick  Slaves usually pay such Tributes as are impos'd upon them and whilst braver Nations lay under the  Roman  Tyranny they were forc'd to submit to the same burdens But even those Tributes were paid for maintaining Armys Fleets and Garisons without which the poor and abject life they led could not have bin preserv'd We owe none but what we freely give None is or can be impos'd upon us unless by our selves We measure our Grants according to our own Will or the present occasions for our own safety Our Ancestors were born free and as the best provision they could make for us they left us that Liberty intire with the best Laws they could devise to defend it 'Tis no way impair'd by the Opinions of the Fathers The words of  Solomon  do rather confirm it The happiness of those who enjoy the like and the shameful misery under which they lie who have suffer'd themselves to be forc'd or cheated out of it may persuade and the justice of the Cause encourage us to think nothing too dear to be hazarded in the defence of it  SECT IX Our own Laws confirm to us the enjoyment of our native Rights  IF that which our Author calls Divinity did reach the things in dispute between us or that the Opinions of the Fathers which he alledges related to them he might have spar'd the pains of examining our Laws for a municipal Sanction were of little force to confirm a perpetual and universal Law given by God to mankind and of no value against it since man cannot abrogate what God has instituted nor one Nation free it self from a Law that is given to all But having abus'd the Scriptures and the Writings of the Fathers whose Opinions are to be valu'd only so far as they rightly interpret them he seems desirous to try whether he can as well put a false sense upon our Law According to his custom he  takes pieces of passages from good Books and turns them directly against the plain meaning of the Authors exprest in the whole scope and design of their Writings To show that he intends to spare none he is not asham'd to cite  Bracton  who of all our antient Lawwriters is most opposite to his Maxims He liv'd says he in  Henry  the third's time since Parliamenns were instituted as if there had bin a time when  England  had wanted them or that the establishment of our Liberty had bin made by the  Normans  who if we will believe our Author came in by force of Arms and opprest us But we have already prov'd the Essence of Parliaments to be as antient as our Nation and that there was no time in which there were not such Councils or Assemblys of the People as had the power of the whole and made or unmade such Laws as best pleas'd themselves We have indeed a  French  word from a People that came from  France  but the Power was always in our selves and the  Norman  Kings were oblig'd to swear they would govern according to the Laws that had bin made by those Assemblys It imports little whether  Bracton  liv'd before or after they came amongst us His words are  Omnes sub eo ipse sub nullo sed tantum sub Deo All are under him and he under none but God only If he offend since no Writ can go out against him their Remedy is by petitioning him to amend his Faults which if he will not do it is punishment enough for him to expect God as an avenger Let none presume to look into his Deeds much less to oppose him  Here is a mixture of Sense and Nonsense Truth and Falshood the words of  Bracton  with our Author's foolish Inferences from them  Bracton  spoke of the politick capacity of the King when no Law had forbidden him to divide it from his natural He gave the name of King to the sovereign Power of the Nation as  Jacob  call'd that of his Descendents The Scepter which he said should not depart from  Judah  till  Shiloh  came tho all men know that his Race did not reign the third part of that time over his own Tribe nor full sourscore years over the whole Nation The same manner of speech is us'd in all parts of the world  Tertullian  under the name of  Cesar  comprehended all magistratical Power and imputed to him the Acts of which in his person he never had any knowledg The  French  say their King is always present  sur son lit de justice  in all the Sovereign Courts of the Kingdom which are not easily number'd and that Maxim could have in it neither sense nor truth if by it they meant a Man who can be but in one place at one time and is always comprehended within the Dimensions of his own Skin These things could not be unknown to  Bracton  the like being in use amongst us and he thought it no offence so far to follow the dictates of Reason prohibited by no Law as to make a difference between the invisible and omnipresent King who never dies and the Person that wears the Crown whom no man without the guilt of Treason may endeavour to kill since there is an Act of Parliament in the case I will not determin whether he spoke properly or no as to  England  but if he did not all that he said being upon a false supposition is nothing to our purpose The same  Bracton  says  the King dos no wrong  in as much as he dos nothing but by Law  Potestas Regis est potestas Legis potestas juris non injuriae  Bract de Leg Angl  The Power of the King is the Power of the Law a power of right not of wrong  Again  If  Qui si sacit injuriam non est Rex  Ibid  the King dos injustice he is not King  In another place he has these words  Exercere igitur debet Rex potestatem juris sicut Dei vicarius minister in terra quia illa potestas solius Dei est potestas autem injuriae Diaboli est non Dei cujus horum opera fecerit Rex e  us minister erit Igitur dum facit justitiam vicarius est regis aeterni Minister autem Diaboli dum declinet ad injuriam  Ibid l    The King therefore ought to exercise the Power of the Law as becomes the Vicar and Minister of God upon Earth because that Power is the Power of God alone but the Power of doing wrong is the Power of the Devil and not of God Aad the King is his Minister whose Work he dos Whilst he dos Justice he is the Vicar of the Eternal King but if he deflect from it to act unjustly he is the Minister of the Devil  He also says that the King is  singulis major universis minor  and that he who is  in justitia exequenda omnibus major in justitia recipienda cuilibet ex plebe fit aequalis  I shall not say  Bracton  is in the right when he speaks in this manner but 'tis a strange impudence in  Filmer  to cite him as a Patron of the absolute Power of Kings who dos so extremely depress them But the grossest of his follys is yet more pardonable than his detestable fraud in falsifying  Bracton  's words and leaving out such as are not for his purpose which shew his meaning to be directly contrary to the sense put upon them That this may appear I shall set down the words as they are found in  Bracton Ipse autem Rex non debet esse sub homine sed sub Deo sub Lege quia Lex facit Regem Attribuat ergo Rex Legi quod Lex attribuit ei id est dominationem potestatem Non est enim Rex ubi dominatur voluntas non Lex quod sub Lege esse debeat cum sit Dei vicarius evidenter apparet  If  Bracton  therefore be a competent Judg the King is under the Law and he is not a King nor God's Vicegerent unless he be so and we all know how to proceed with those who being under the Law offend against it For the Law is not made in vain In this case something more is to be done than petitioning and 'tis ridiculous to say that if  he will not amend 'tis punishment enough for him to expect God an Avenger  for the same may be said of all Malefactors God can sufficiently punish Thieves and Murderers but the future Judgment of which perhaps they have no belief is not sufficient to restrain them from committing more Crimes nor to deter others from following their example God was always able to punish Murderers but yet by his Law he commands man to shed the blood of him who should shed man's blood and declares that the Land cannot be purg'd of the Guilt by any other means He had Judgments in store for  Jeroboam Ahab  and those that were like them but yet he commanded that according to that Law their Houses should be destroy'd from the earth The dogs lick'd up the blood of  Ahab  where they had lick'd that of  Naboth  and eat  Jezebel  who had contriv'd his murder  But  says our Author  we must not look into his deeds much less oppose them  Must not  David  look into  Saul  's deeds nor oppose them Why did he then bring together as many men as he could to oppose and make foreign Alliances against him even with the  Moabites  and the accursed  Philistins  Why did  Jehu  not only destroy  Ahab  's house but kill the King of  Judah  and his forty Brothers only for going to visit his Children Our Author may perhaps say because God commanded them But if God commanded them to do so he did not command them and all mankind not to do so and if he did not forbid they have nothing to restrain them from doing the like unless they have made municipal Laws of their own to the contrary which our Author and his Followers may produce when they can find them  His next work is to go back again to the Tribute paid by Christ to  Cesar  and judiciously to infer that all Nations must pay the same Duty to their Magistrats as the  Jews  did to the  Romans  who had subdu'd them  Christ did not  says he  ask what the Law of the Land was nor inquire whether there was a Statute against it nor whether the Tribute were given by the consent of the People but upon sight of the superscription concluded  c It had bin strange if Christ had inquir'd after their Laws Statutes or Consent when he knew that their Commonwealth with all the Laws by which it had subsisted was abolish'd and that  Israel  was become a Servant to those who exercis'd a most violent domination over them which being a peculiar punishment for their peculiar sins can have no influence upon Nations that are not under the same circumstances  But of all that he says nothing is more incomprehensible than what he can mean by lawful Kings to whom all is due that was due to the  Roman  Usurpers For lawful Kings are Kings by the Law In being Kings by the Law they are such Kings as the Law makes them and that Law only must tell us what is due to them or by a universal Patriarchical Right to which no man can have a title as is said before till he prove himself to be the right Heir of  Noah  If neither of these are to be regarded but that Right follows Possession there is no such thing as a Usurper he who has the Power has the Right as indeed  Filmer  says and his Wisdom as well as his Integrity is sufficiently declar'd by the Assertion  This wicked extravagancy is follow'd by an attempt of as singular ignorance and stupidity to shuffle together Usurpers and Conquerors as if they were the same whereas there have bin many Usurpers who were not Conquerors and Conquerors that deserv'd not the name of Usurpers No wise man ever said that  Agathocles  or  Dionysius  conquer'd  Syracuse Tarquin Galba  or  Otho Rome Cromwel England  or that the  Magi  who seiz'd the Government of  Persia  after the death of  Cambyses  conquer'd that Country When  Moses  and  Joshua  had overthrown the Kingdoms of the  Amorites Moabites  and  Cananites  or when  David  subdu'd the  Ammonites Edomites  and others none as I suppose but such Divines as  Filmer  will say they usurp'd a Dominion over them There is such a thing amongst men as just War or else ttue Valor could not be a Vertue but a Crime and instead of glory the utmost infamy would always be the companion of Victory There are says  Belli aque ac pacis jura  De jur bel pac  Grotius  Laws of War as well as of Peace He who for a just Cause and by just Means carrys on a just War has as clear a right to what is acquir'd as can be enjoy'd by Man but all Usurpation is detestable and abominable  SECT X The words of St  Paul  enjoining obedience to higher Powers favor all sorts of Governments no less than Monarchy  OUR Author's next quarrel is with St  Paul who did not  at he says  in enjoining subjection to the higher Powers signify the Laws of the Land or mean the highest Powers as well Aristocratical and Democratical as Regal but a Monarch that carries the Sword  c But what if there be no Monarch in the place or what if he do not carry the Sword Had the Apostle spoken in vain if the liberty of the  Romans  had not bin overthrown by the fraud and violence of  Cesar  Was no obedience to be exacted whilst that people enjoy'd the benefit of their own Laws and Vertue flourish'd under the moderate Government of a legal and just Magistracy establish'd for the common good by the common consent of all Had God no Minister amongst them till Law and Justice was overthrown the best part of the people destroy'd by the fury of a corrupt mercenary Soldiery and the world subdu'd under the Tyranny of the worst Monsters that it had ever produc'd Are these the ways of establishing God's Vicegerents and will he patronize no Governors or Governments but such as these Dos God uphold evil and that only If the world has bin hitherto mistaken in giving the name of evil to that which is good and calling that good which is evil I desire to know what can be call'd good amongst men if the Government of the  Romans  till they enter'd  Greece  and  Asia  and were corrupted by the Luxury of both do not deserve that name or what is to be esteem'd evil if the establishment and exercise of the  Cesars  Power were not so But says he  Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power  And was there no Power in the Governments that had no Monarchs Were the  Carthaginians Romans Grecians Gauls Germans  and  Spaniards  without Power Was there no Sword in that Nation and their Magistrats who overthrew the Kingdoms of  Armenia Egypt Numidia Macedon  with many others and whom none of the Monarchs were able to resist Are the  Venetians Switzers Grisons  and  Hollanders  now le  t in the same weakness and no obedience at all due to their Magistrats If this be so how comes it to pass that Justice is so well administer'd amongst them Who is it that defends the  Hollanders  in such a manner that the greatest Monarchs with all their Swords have had no great reason to boast of any Advantages gain'd against them at least till we whom they could not resist when we had no Monarch tho we have bin disgracefully beaten by them since we had one by making Leagues against them and sowing divisions amongst them instigated and assisted the greatest Power now in the world to their destruction and our own But our Author is so accustom'd to fraud that he never cites a passage of Scripture which he dos not abuse or vitiate and that he may do the same in this place he leaves out the following words  For there is no power but of God  that he might intitle one sort only to his protection If therefore the People and popular Magistrats of  Athens  the two Kings  Ephori  and Senat of  Sparta  the  Sanhedrins  amongst the  Hebrews  the Consuls Tribuns Pretors and  Senat of  Rome  the Magistrats of  Holland Switzerland  and  Venice  have or had power we may conclude that they also were ordain'd by God and that according to the precept of the Apostle the same obedience for the same reason is due to them as to any Monarch  The Apostle farther explaining himself and shewing who may be accounted a Magistrate and what the duty of such a one is informs us when we should fear and on what account  Rulers  says he  are not a terror to good works but to the evil Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same for he is the Minister of God a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil  He therefore is only the Minister of God who is not a terror to good works but to evil who executes wrath upon those that do evil and is a praise to those that do well And he who dos well ought not to be afraid of the power for he shall receive praise Now if our Author were alive tho he was a man of a hard forehead I would ask him whether in his Conscience he believ'd that  Tiberius Caligula Claudius Nero  and the rabble of succeeding Monsters were a praise to those who did well and a terror to those who did ill and not the contrary a praise to the worst and a terror to the best men of the world or for what reason  Ob virtutes certissimum exitium  Tacitus  could say that Vertue brought men who liv'd under 'em to certain destruction and recite so many Examples of the brave and good who were murder'd by them for being so unless they had endeavour'd to extinguish all that was good and to  Ipsam exscindere virtutem  tear up Vertue by the roots Why did he call  Domitian  an  Virtutibus infestum  Enemy to Vertue if he was a terror only to those that did evil If the world has hitherto bin misled in these things and given the name of Vertue to Vice and of Vice to Vertue then  Germanicus Valerius Asiaticus Corbulo Helvidius Priscus Thraseas Soranus  and others that resembled them who fell under the rage of those Beasts nay  Paul  himself and his Disciples were evil doers and  Macro Narcissus Pallas Vinnius Laco  and  Tigellinus  were vertuous and good men If this be so we are beholden to  Filmer  for admonishing mankind of the error in which they had so long continu'd If not those who persecuted and murder'd them for their Vertues were not a terror to such as did evil and a praise to those who did well The worst men had no need to fear them but the best had because they were the best All Princes therefore that have power are not to be esteem'd equally the Ministers of God They that are so must receive their dignity from a title that is not common to all even from a just employment of their power to the incouragement of Vertue and to the discouragement of Vice He that pretends to the veneration and obedience due to the Ministers of God must by his actions manifest that he is so And tho I am unwilling to advance a proposition that may sound harshly to tender ears I am inclin'd to believe that the same rule which obliges us to yield obedience to the good Magistrate who is the Minister of God and assures us that in obeying him we obey God dos equally oblige us not to obey those who make themselves the Ministers of the Devil lest in obeying them we obey the Devil whose works they do  That none but such as are wilfully ignorant may mistake  Paul  's meaning  Peter  who was directed by the same Spirit says distinctly  Submit  your selves to every Ordinance of man for the Lord's sake  If therefore there be several Ordinances of men tending to the same end that is the obtaining of Justice by being a terror to▪ the evil and a praise to the good the like obedience is for conscience sake enjoin'd to all and upon the same condition But as no man dares to say that  Athens  and  Persia Carthage  and  Egypt Switzerland  and  France Venice  and  Turky  were and are under the same Government the same obedience is due to the Magistrate in every one of those places and all others on the same account whilst they continue to be the Ministers of God  If our Author say that  Peter  cannot comprehend Kings under the name of human Ordinances since  Paul  says they are the Ordinance of God I may as well say that  Paul  cannot call that the Ordinance of God which  Peter  calls the ordinance of man But as it was said of  Moses  and  Samuel  that they who spoke by the same Spirit could not contradict each other  Peter  and  Paul  being full of Wisdom and Sanctity and inspir'd by the same Spirit must needs say the same thing and  Grotius  shews that they perfectly agree tho the one calls Kings Rulers and Governors the Ordinance of Man and the other the Ordinance of God inasmuch as God having from the beginning ordain'd that men should not live like Wolves in woods every man by himself but together in Civil Societys left to every one a liberty of joining with that Society which best pleas'd him and to every Society to create such Magistrats and frame such Laws as should seem most conducing to their own good according to the measure of light and reason they might have And every Magistracy so instituted might rightly be call'd the Ordinance of Man who was the Instituter and the Ordinance of God according to which it was instituted  Quia salubrem hominum Constitutionem Deus probavit sauxie  De Jur Bel Pac  because  says he  God approv'd and ratify'd the salutary Constitutions of Government made by men  But says our Author  Peter  expounds his own words of the human Ordinance to be the King who is the  Lex loquens  but he says no such thing and I do not find that any such thought ever enter'd into the Apostle's mind The words are often found in the works of  Plato  and  Aristotle  but apply'd only to such a man as is a King by nature who is endow'd with all the vertues that tend to the good of human Societys in a greater measure than any or all those that compose them which Character I think will be ill apply'd to all Kings And that this may appear to be true I desire to know whether it would well have agreed with  Nero Caligula Domitian  or others like to them and if not with them then not with all bot only with those who are endow'd with such Vertues But if the King be made by man he must be such as man makes him to be and if the power of a Law had bin given by any human Sanction to the word of a foolish mad or wicked man which I hardly believe it would be destroy'd by its own iniquity and turpitude and the People left under the obligation of rendring obedience to those who so use the Sword that the Nations under them may live soberly peaceably and honestly  This obliges me a little to examin what is meant by the Sword The Pope says there are two Swords the one temporal the other spiritual and that both of them were given to  Peter  and to his Successors Others more rightly understand the two Swords to be that of War and that of  Justice which according to several Constitutions of Government have bin committed to several hands under several conditions and limitations The Sword of Justice comprehends the Legislative and the Executive Power the one is exercis'd in making Laws the other in judging Controversys according to such as are made The military Sword is us'd by those Magistrats who have it in making War or Peace with whom they think fit and sometimes by others who have it not in pursuing such Wars as are resolv'd upon by another Power The Jewish Doctors generally agree that the Kings of  Judah  could make no Law because there was a curse denounc'd against those who should add to or detract from that which God had given by the hand of  Moses  that they might sit in Judgment with the High Priest and Sanhedrin but could not judg by themselves unless the Sanhedrin did plainly fail of performing their duty Upon this account  Maimonides  excuses  David  for commanding  Solomon  not to suffer the grey hairs of  Joab  to go down to the grave in peace and  Solomon  for appointing him to be kill'd at the foot of the Altar for he having kill'd  Abner  and  Amasa  and by those actions shed the blood of war in time of peace the Sanhedrin should have punish'd him but being protected by favor or power and even  David  himself fearing him  Solomon  was put in mind of his duty which he perform'd tho  Joab  laid hold upon the horns of the Altar which by the express words of the Law gave no protection to wilful Murderers  The use of the military Sword amongst them was also moderated Their Kings might make War upon the seven accursed Nations that they were commanded to destroy and so might any other man for no peace was to be made with them but not against any other Nation without the assent of the Sanhedrin And when  Amaziah  contrary to that Law had foolishly made war upon  Joash  King of  Israel  and thereby brought a great slaughter upon  Judah  the Princes that is the Sanhedrin combin'd against him pursu'd him to  Lachish  and kill'd him there  The Legislative Power of  Sparta  was evidently in the People The Laws that go under the name of  Lycurgus  were propos'd by him to the general Assembly of the People and from them receiv'd their Authority But the disciplin they contain'd was of such efficacy sor framing the minds of men to vertue and by banishing Silver and Gold they so far banish'd all manner of Crimes that from the institution of those Laws to the times of their Corruption which was more than eight hundred years we hardly find that three men were put to death of whom two were Kings so that it seems difficult to determin where the power of judging did reside tho 'tis most probable considering the nature of their Government that it was in the Senat and in Cases extraordinary in the  Ephori  with a right of appealing to the People Their Kings theresore conld have little to do with the Sword of Justice neither the Legislative nor the Judicial Power being any ways in them  The military Sword was not much more in their power unless the excellency of their Vertues gave them the credit of persuading when the Law deny'd the right of commanding They were oblig'd to make war against those and those only who were declar'd Enemys by the Senat and  Ephori  and in the manner place and time they directed so that  Agesilaus  tho carrying on a glorious War in  Persia  no sooner receiv'd the Parchment Roll wherein he was commanded by the  Ephori  to come home for the desence of his own Country than he immediately  return'd and is on that account call'd by no less a man than  Xenophon  a good and faithful King rendring obedience to the Laws of his Country  By this it appears that there are Kings who may be fear'd by those that do ill and not by such as do well for having no more power than what the Law gives and being oblig'd to execute it as the Law directs they cannot depart from the Precept of the Apostle My own actions therefore or the sense of my own guilt arising from them is to be the measure of my fear of that Magistrate who is the Minister of God and not his Power  The like may be said of almost all the Nations of the world that have had any thing of Civil Order amongst them The supreme Magistrate under what name soever he was known whether King Emperor Asymnetes Suffetes Consul Dictator or Archon has usually a part assign'd to him in the administration of Justice and making War but that he may know it to be assign'd and not inherent and so assign'd as to be employ'd for the publick good not to his own profit or pleasure it is circumscrib'd by such rules as he cannot safely transgress This is above all seen in the German Nations from whom we draw our Original and Government and is so well describ'd by  Tacitus  in his treatise of their Customs and Manners that I shall content my self to refer to it and to what I have cited from him in the former part of this Work The Saxons coming into our Country retain'd to themselves the same rights They had no Kings but such as were set up by themselves and they abrogated their Power when they pleas'd  Ad Libertatis vestrae tuitionem non meis meritis sed sola liberalitate vestra  Offa  acknowledg'd  that he was chosen for the defence of their Liberty not from his own merit but by their favor  and in the  Conventus Pananglicus  at which all the chief men as well Secular as Ecclesiastical were present it was decreed by the King Archbishops Bishops Abbots Dukes and Senators that the Kings should be chosen by the Priests and by the Elders of the People In pursuance of which  Egbert  who had no right to the succession was made King  Ethelwerd  was chosen in the same manner  Omnium consensu  by the consent of all  Ethelwolf  a Monk for want of a better was advanc'd to the same Honor His Son  Alfred  tho crown'd by the Pope and marrying without the consent of the Nobility and Kingdom  Contra morem statuta  against their Customs and Statutes acknowledg'd that he had receiv'd the Crown from the bounty of the Princes Elders and People and in his Will declar'd that he left the People as he had found them free as the inward thoughts of Man His Son  Edward  Successor Monarchiae electus  was elected to be his Successor  Ethelstan  tho a Bastard and without all Title was elected by the consent of the Nobility and People  Eadred  by the same Authority was elected and prefer'd before the Sons of  Edmond  his Predecessor  Edwin  tho rightly chosen was depos'd for his ill life and  Edgar  Et eligerunt Deo dictante Edgarum in Regem annuente populo  elected King  by the will of God and consent of the People  But he also was depriv'd of the Crown for the Rape of a Nun and after seven years restor'd by the whole People  coram omni multitudine  populi Anglorum Ethelred  who is said to have bin  Saevus in principio miser in medio turpis in exitu  cruel in the beginning wretched in the course and infamous in the end of his Reign was depos'd by the same Power that had advanc'd him  Canutus  made a  Canutus  oedus cum principibus omni populo illi cum ipso percusserunt  Contract with the Princes and the whole People and thereupon was by general consent crown'd King over all  England  After him  Harold  was chosen in the usual manner He being dead a Message was sent to  Hardi Canute  with an offer of the Crown which he accepted and accordingly was receiv'd  Edward  the Confessor was  Annuente Clero populo Londini in regem eligitur  elected King with the consent of the Clergy and People at  London  and  Harold  excus'd himself for not performing his Oath to  William  the  Norman  because he said he had made it unduly and presumptuously  Abs{que} generali Senatus Populi conventu edicto  Matth Paris Gul Gemit c  without consulting the Nobility and People and without their Authority  William  was receiv'd with great joy by the Clergy and People and saluted King by all swearing to observe the antient good and approv'd Laws of  England  and tho he did but ill perform his Oath yet before his death he seem'd to repent of the ways he had taken and only wishing his Son might be King of  England  he confest in his last Will made at  Caen  in  Normandy  Neminem Anglici regni constituo haeredem non enim tantum decus hareditario jure possedi  Ibid  that he neither found nor left the Kingdom as an Inheritance If he possest no right except what was confer'd upon him no more was confer'd than had bin enjoy'd by the antient Kings according to the approv'd Laws which he swore to observe Those Laws gave no power to any till he was elected and that which they did then give was so limited that the Nobility and People reserv'd to themselves the disposition of the greatest Affairs even to the deposition and expulsion of such as should not well perform the duty of their Oath and Office And I leave it to our Author to prove how they can be said to have had the Sword and the Power so as to be fear'd otherwise than as the Apostle says by those that do evil which we acknowledg to be not only in the King but in the lowest Officer of Justice in the world  If it be pretended that our later Kings are more to be fear'd than  William  the  Norman  or his Predecessors it must not be as has bin prov'd either from the general right of Kings or from the Doctrin of the Apostle but from something else that is peculiar and subsequent which I leave our Author's Disciples to prove and an answer may be found in due time But to show that our Ancestors did not mistake the words of the Apostle 'tis good to consider when to whom and upon what occasion he spoke The Christian Religion was then in its infancy his discourses were addrest to the Professors of it who tho they soon grew to be considerable in number were for the most part of the meanest sort of People Servants or Inhabitants of the Citys rather than Citizens and Freemen join'd in no civil Body or Society nor such as had or could have any part in the Government The occasion was to suppress the dangerous mistake of many converted Jews and others who knowing themselves to be freed from the power of Sin and the Devil presum'd they were also freed from the obligation of human Laws And if this Error had not bin crop'd in the bud it would have given occasion to their Enemys who desir'd nothing more to destroy them all  and who knowing that such Notions were stirring among them would have bin glad that they who were not easily to be discover'd had by that means discover'd themselves  This induc'd a necessity of diverting a poor mean scatter'd People from such thoughts concerning the State to convince them of the Error into which they were fallen that Christians did not owe the same obedience to Civil Laws and Magistrats as other men and to keep them from drawing destruction upon themselves by such ways as not being warranted by God had no promise of his Protection St  Paul  's work was to preserve the Professors of Christianity as appears by his own words  Tim  I exhort that first of all Supplications Prayers Intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for Kings and for all that are in Authority that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty Put  Tit  them in mind to be subject to Principalitys and Powers to obey Magistrats to be ready for every good work  St  Peter  agrees with him fully in describing the Magistrate and his Duty shewing the reasons why obedience should be paid to him and teaching Christians to be humble and contented with their condition as free yet not using their Liberty for a cover to malice and not only to fear God and honor the King of which conjunction of words such as  Filmer  are very proud but  to honor all men  as is said in the same verse This was in a peculiar manner the work of that time in which those who were to preach and propagate the Gospel were not to be diverted from that Duty by entangling themselves in the care of Stateaffairs but it dos in some sense agree with all times for it can never be the duty of a good man to oppose such a Magistrate as is the Minister of God in the exercise of his Office nor to deny to any man that which is his due  But as the Christian Law exempts no man from the Duty he ows to his Father Master or the Magistrate it dos not make him more a Slave than he was before nor deprive him of any natural or civil Right and if we are oblig'd to pay Tribute Honor or any other thing where it is not due it must be by some Precept very different from that which commands us to give to  Cesar  that which is  Cesar  's If he define the Magistrate to be the Minister of God doing Justice and from thence draws the Reasons he gives for rendring Obedience to him we are to inquire whose Minister he is who overthrows it and look for some other reason for rendring obedience to him than the words of the Apostles If  David  who was willing to lay down his life for the people who  hated iniquity  and would not  suffer a liar to come into his presence  was the Minister of God I desire to know whose Minister  Caligula  was who set up himself to be worship'd for a God and would at once have destroy'd all the people that he ought to have protected Whose Minister was  Nero  who besides the abominable impuritys of his life and hatred to all Vertue as contrary to his Person and Government set fire to the great City If it be true that  contrariorum contraria est ratio  these questions are easily decided and if the reasons of things are eternal the same distinction grounded upon truth will be good for ever Every Magistrate and every man by his works will for ever declare whose Minister he is in what spirit he lives and consequently what obedience is due to him according to the Precept of the Apostle If any man ask what I mean by Justice I answer That the Law of the Land as far as it is  Sanctio rect a jubens honesta prohibens contraria  declares what it is But there have bin and are Laws that are neither just nor commendable There was a Law in  Rome  that no God should be worship'd without the consent of the Senat Upon which  Tertullian  says scoffingly  Nisi homini Deus placuerit Deus non erit  That God shall not be God unless he please Man  and by virtue of this Law the first Christians were expos'd to all manner of crueltys and some of the Emperors in other respects excellent Men most foully polluted themselves and their Government with innocent Blood  Antoninus Pius  was taken in this snare and  Tertullian  bitterly derides  Trajan  for glorying in his Clemency when he had commanded  Pliny  who was Proconsul in  Asia  not to make any search for Christians but only to punish them according to Law when they should be brought before him No Municipal Law can be more firmly establish'd by human Authority than that of the Inquisition in  Spain  and other places And those accursed Tribunals which have shed more Christian blood than all the Pagans that ever were in the world are commonly call'd  The Holy Office  If a Gentleman in  Poland  kill a Peasant he is by a Law now in use free from punishment if he lay a Ducat upon the dead Body  Evenus  the Third King of  Scotland  caus'd a Law to pass by which the Wives and Daughters of Noblemen were expos'd to his Lust and those of the Commons to the Lust of the Nobility These and an infinite number of others like to them were not right Sanctions but such as have produc'd unspeakable mischiefs and calamitys They were not therefore Laws the name of Justice is abusively attributed to them Those that govern by them cannot be the Ministers of God and the Apostle commanding our obedience to the Minister of God for our good commands us not to be obedient to the Minister of the Devil to our hurt for we cannot serve two Masters  SECT XI That which is not just is not Law and that which is not Law ought not to be obey'd  OUR Author having for a long time pretended Conscience now pulls off his Mask and plainly tells us that 'tis not on account of Conscience but for fear of punishment or in hope of reward that Laws are to be obey'd  That familiar distinction of the Schoolmen  says he  whereby they subject Kings to the directive but not to the coactive Power of the Law is a confession that Kings are not bound by the positive Laws of any Nation since the compulsory Power of Laws is that which properly makes Laws to be Laws  Not troubling my self with this distinction of the Schoolmen nor acknowledging any truth to be in it or that they are competent Judges of such matters I say that if it be true our Author's conclusion is altogether false for the directive Power of the Law which is certain and grounded upon the inherent good and rectitude that is in it is that alone which has a power over the Conscience whereas the coercive is merely contingent and the most just powers commanding the most just things have so osten fallen under the violence of the most unjust men commanding the most execrable villanys that if they were therefore to be obey'd the Consciences of men must be regulated by the success of a Battel or Conspiracy than which nothing can be affirm'd more impious and absurd  By this rule  David  was not to be obey'd when by the wickedness of his Son he was driven from  Jerusalem  and depriv'd of all coercive Power and the conscientious obedience that had bin due to him was transfer'd to  Absalom  who sought his life And in St  Paul  's time it was not from him who was guided only by the Spirit of God and had no manner of coercive Power that Christians were to learn their duty but from  Caligula Claudius  and  Nero  who had that Power well establish'd by the mercenary Legions If this were so the Governments of the World might be justly call'd  Magna Latrocinia  and men laying aside all considerations of Reason or Justice ought only to follow those who can inflict the greatest Punishments or give the greatest Rewards But since the reception of such opinions would be the extirpation of all that can be call'd good we must look for another rule of our obedience and shall find that to be the Law which being as I said before  Sanctio recta  must be founded upon that eternal Principle of Reason and Truth from whence the rule of Justice which is sacred and pure ought to be deduc'd and not from the deprav'd will of man which fluctuating according to the different Interests Humors and Passions that at several times reign in several Nations one day abrogates what had bin enacted the other The Sanction therefore that deserves the name of a Law  which derives not its excellency from Antiquity or from the dignity of the Legislators but from an intrinsick equity and justice  ought to be made in pursuance of that universal Reason to which all Nations at all times owe an equal veneration and obedience By this we may know whether he who has the Power dos justice or not Whether he be the Minister of God to our good a protector of good and a terror to ill men or the Minister of the Devil to our hurt by encouraging all manner of evil and endeavouring by vice and corruption to make the people worse that they may be miserable and miserable that they may be worse I dare not say I shall never fear such a man if he be arm'd with power But I am sure I shall never esteem him to be the Minister of God and shall think I do ill if I fear him If he has therefore a coercive Power over me 'tis thro my weakness  for  Qui cogi potest nescit mori  he that will suffer himself to be compel'd knows not how to die  If therefore he who dos not follow the directive Power of the Law be not the Minister of God he is not a King at least not such a King as the Apostle commands us to obey And if that Sanction which is not just be not a Law and can have no obligation upon us by what Power soever it be establish'd it may well fall out that the Magistrate who will not follow the directive Power of the Law may fall under the coercive and then the fear is turn'd upon him with this aggravation that it is not only actual but just This was the case of  Nero  the coercive Power was no longer in him but against him He that was forc'd to fly and to hide himself that was abandon'd by all men and condemn'd to die  More Majorum  Sueton  according to antient Custom  did as I suppose fear and was no way to be fear'd The like may be said of  Amaziah  King of  Judah  when he fled to  Lachish  of  Nabuchodonozor  when he was driven from the society of men and of many Emperors and Kings of the greatest Nations in the world who have bin so utterly depriv'd of all Power that they have bin imprison'd depos'd confin'd to Monasterys kill'd drawn thro the Streets cut in pieces thrown into Rivers and indeed suffer'd all that could be suffer'd by the vilest Slaves  If any man say these things ought not to have bin done an answer may be given in a proper place tho 'twere enough to say that the Justice of the world is not to be overthrown by a mere Assertion without proof but that is nothing to the present Question For if it was ill done to drive  Nero  to despair or to throw  Vitellius  into the common Shore it was not because they were the Ministers of God for their Lives were no way conformable to the character which the Apostle gives of those who deserve that Sacred Name If those only are to be fear'd who have the Power there was a time when they were not to be fear'd for they had none and if such Princes are not oblig'd by the Law as are not under the coercive Power it gave no exemption to those for they fell under it and as we know not what will befal others who walk in their steps till they are dead we cannot till then know whether they are free from it or not  SECT XII The Right and Power of a Magistrate depends upon his Institution not upon his Name  'TIS usual with Impostors to obtrude their deceits upon men by putting false names upon things by which they may perplex mens minds and from thence deduce false Conclusions But the points above▪mention'd being settled it imports little whether the Governors to whom  Peter  enjoins obedience were only Kings and such as are employ'd by them or all such Magistrats as are the Ministers of God for he informs us of their Works that we may know them and accordingly yield obedience to them This is that therefore which distinguishes the Magistrate to whom obedience is due from him to whom none is due and not the name that he either assumes or others put upon him But if there be any virtue in the word King and that the admirable Prerogatives of which our Author dreams were annex'd to that Name they could not be apply'd to the  Roman  Emperors nor their substituted Officers for they had it not 'Tis true  Mark Anthony  in a drunken fit at the celebration of the impure  Lupercalia  did offer a Diadem to  Julius Cesar  which some flatterers prest him to accept as our great Lawyers did  Cromwel  but he durst not think of putting it upon his Head  Caligula  's affectation of that title and the ensigns of Royalty he wore were taken for the most evident marks of his madness and tho the greatest and bravest of their men had fallen by the Wars or Proscriptions tho the best part of the Senat had perish'd in  Thessaly  tho the great City was exhausted and  Italy  brought to desolation yet they were not reduc'd so low as to endure a King  Piso  was sufficiently addicted to  Tiberius  yet he could not suffer that  Germanicus  should be treated as the Son of a King  Principis Romani non Parthorum regis silio has epulas dari  And whoever understands the Latin Tongue and the History of those times will easily perceive that the word  Princeps  signify'd no more than a principal or eminent man as has bin already prov'd and the words of  Piso  could have no other meaning than that the Son of a  Roman  ought not to be distinguish'd from others as the Sons of the  Parthian  Kings were This is verify'd by his Letter to  Tiberius  under the name of Friend and the  answer of  Tiberius  promising to him  Quod amicus amico praestare potest  Tacit  whatsoever one friend could do for another  Here was no mention of Majesty or Sovereign Lord nor the base subscriptions of Servant Subject or Creature And I fear that as the last of those words was introduc'd amongst us by our Bishops the rest of them had bin also invented by such Christians as were too much addicted to the Asiatick Slavery However the name of King was never solemnly assum'd by nor confer'd upon those Emperors and could have confer'd no right if it had They exercis'd as they pleas'd or as they durst the power that had bin gain'd by violence or fraud The exorbitances they committed could not have bin justify'd by a Title any more than those of a Pyrat who should take the same It was no otherwise given to 'em than by way of assimilation when they were guilty of the greatest Crimes and  Tacitus  describing the detestable Lust of  Annal l  Tiberius  says  Quibus adeo indomitis exarserat ut more Regio pubem ingenuam stupris pollueret nec formam tantum decora corporis sed in his modestam pueritiam in aliis majorum imagines incitamentum cupiditatis habebat  He also informs us that  Nero  took his time to put  Bareas Soranus  to death who was one of the most vertuous men of that age when  Tiridates  King of  Armenia  was at  Rome  Ut magnitudinem Imperatoriam caede insignium virorum quasi Regio facinore ostentaret  An      That he might shew the Imperial Grandeur by the slaughter of the most illustrious men which he accounted a Royal Action  I leave it to the judgment of all wise men whether it be probable that the Apostles should distinguish such as these from other Magistrats and dignify those only with the Title of God's Ministers who distinguish'd themselves by such ways or that the succeeding Emperors should be ennobled with the same Prerogative who had no other Title to the name than by resembling those that had it in such things as these If this be too absurd and abominable to enter into the heart of a man it must be concluded that their intention was only to divert the poor People to whom they preach'd from involving themselves in the care of Civil matters to which they had no call And the Counsel would have bin good as things stood with them if they had bin under the power of a Pyrat or any other villain substituted by him  But tho the Apostles had look'd upon the Officers set over the Provinces belonging to the Roman Empire as sent by Kings I desire to know whether it can be imagin'd that they could think the subordinate Governors to be sent by Kings in the Countrys that had no Kings or that obedience became due to the Magistrats in  Greece Italy  or other Provinces under the jurisdiction of  Rome  only after they had Emperors and that none was due to them before The  Germans  had then no King The brave  Arminius  had bin lately kill'd for aiming at a Crown When he had blemish'd all his Vertues by that attempt they forgot his former Services They never consider'd how many Roman Legions he had cut in pieces nor how many thousands of their Allies he had destroy'd His Valor was a crime deserving death when he sought to make a Prey of his Country which he had so bravely defended and to enslave those who with him had fought for the publick Liberty But if the Apostles were to be understood to give the name of God's Ministers only to Kings and those who are employ'd by them and that obedience is due  to no other a domestick Tyrant had bin their greatest Benefactor He had set up the only Government that is authoriz'd by God and to which a conscientious obedience is due  Agathocles Dionysius Phalaris Phaereus Pisistratus Nabis Machanidas  and an infinite number of the most detestable Villains that the world has ever produc'd did confer the same benefits upon the Countrys they enslav'd But if this be equally false sottish absurd and execrable all those Epithets belong to our Author and his Doctrin for attempting to depress all modest and regular Magistracys and endeavouring to corrupt the Scripture to patronize the greatest of Crimes No man therefore who dos not delight in error can think that the Apostle design'd precisely to determin such questions as might arise concerning any one man's right or in the least degree to prefer any one form of Government before another In acknowledging the Magistrate to be Man's Ordinance he declares that Man who makes him to be may make him to be what he pleases and tho there is found more prudence and vertue in one Nation than in another that Magistracy which is establish'd in any one ought to be obey'd till they who made the establishment think fit to alter it All therefore whilst they continue are to be look'd upon with the same respect Every Nation acting freely has an equal right to frame their own Government and to employ such Officers as they please The Authority Right and Power of these must be regulated by the judgment right and power of those who appoint them without any relation at all to the name that is given for that is no way essential to the thing The same name is frequently given to those who differ exceedingly in right and power and the same right and power is as often annex'd to Magistracys that differ in name The same power which had bin in the Roman Kings was given to the Consuls and that which had bin legally in the Dictators for a time not exceeding six months was afterwards usurp'd by the  Cesars  and made perpetual The supreme Power which some pretend belongs to all Kings has bin and is enjoy'd in the fullest extent by such as never had the name and no Magistracy was ever more restrain'd than those that had the name of Kings in  Sparta Arragon England Poland  and other places They therefore that did thus institute regulate and restrain create Magistracys and give them names and powers as seem'd best to them could not but have in themselves the coercive as well as the directive over them for the regulation and restriction is coercion but most of all the institution by which they could make them to be or not to be As to the exterior sorce 'tis sometimes on the side of the Magistrate and sometimes on that of the People and as Magistrats under several names have the same work incumbent upon 'em and the same Power to persorm it the same Duty is to be exacted from them and render'd to them which being distinctly proportion'd by the Laws of every Country I may conclude that all Magistratical Power being the Ordinance of Man in pursuance of the Ordinance of God receives its being and measure from the Legislative Power of every Nation And whether the power be plac'd simply in one a few or many men or in one body compos'd of the three simple Species whether the single Person be call'd King Duke Marquess Emperor Sultan Mogol or Grand Signor or the number go under the name of Senat Council Pregadi Diet Assembly of Estates and the like 'tis the same thing The same obedience is equally due to all whilst according to the Precept of the Apostle they do the work of God for our good and if they  depart from it no one of them has a better Title than the other to our obedience  SECT XIII Laws were made to direct and instruct Magistrats and if they will not be directed to restrain them  I Know not who they are that our Author introduces to say that  the first invention of Laws was to bridle or moderate the overgreat Power of Kings  and unless they give some better proof of their judgment in other things shall little esteem them They should have consider'd that there are Laws in many places where there are no Kings that there were Laws in many before there were Kings as in  Israel  the Law was given three hundred years before they had any but most especially that as no man can be a rightful King except by Law nor have any just Power but from the Law if that Power be found to be overgreat the Law that gave it must have bin before that which was to moderate or restrain it for that could not be moderated which was not in being Leaving therefore our Author to fight with these Adversarys if he please when he finds them I shall proceed to examin his own Positions  The truth is  says he  the Original of Laws was for the keeping of the Multitude in order Popular Estates could not subsist at all without Laws whereas Kingdoms were govern'd many Ages without them The People of  Athens  as soon as they gave over Kings were forc'd to give power to  Draco  first then to  Solon  to make them Laws  If we will believe him therefore wheresoever there is a King or a man who by having power in his hands is in the place of a King there is no need of Law He takes them all to be so wise just and good that they are Laws to themselves  Leges viventes  This was certainly verify'd by the whole succession of the  Cesars  the ten last Kings of  Pharamond  's Race all the Successors of  Charles  the Great and others that I am not willing to name but referring my self to History I desire all reasonable men to consider whether the piety and tender care that was natural to  Caligula Nero  or  Domitian  was such a security to the Nations that liv'd under them as without Law to be sufficient for their preservation for if the contrary appear to be true and that their Government was a perpetual exercise of rage malice and madness by which the worst of men were arm'd with power to destroy the best so that the Empire could only be sav'd by their destruction 'tis most certain that mankind can never fall into a condition which stands more in need of Laws to protect the innocent than when such Monsters reign who endeavour their extirpation and are too well furnish'd with means to accomplish their detestable designs Without any prejudice therefore to the Cause that I defend I might confess that all Nations were at the first govern'd by Kings and that no Laws were impos'd upon those Kings till they or the Successors of those who had bin advanc'd for their vertues by falling into vice and corruption did manifestly discover the inconveniences of depending upon their will Besides these there are also children women and fools that often come to the succession of Kingdoms whose weakness and ignorance stands in as great need of support and direction as the desperate  fury of the others can do of restriction And if some Nations had bin so sottish not to foresee the mischief of leaving them to their will others or the same in succeeding Ages discovering them could no more be oblig'd to continue in so pernicious a folly than we are to live in that wretched Barbarity in which the  Romans  found our Ancestors when they first enter'd this Island  If any man say that  Filmer  dos not speak of Monsters nor of Children Women or Fools but of wise just and good Princes I answer that if there be a right inherent in Kings as Kings of doing what they please and in those who are next in blood to succeed them and inherit the same it must belong to all Kings and such as upon title of blood would be Kings And as there is no family that may not and dos not often produce such as I mention'd it must also be acknowledg'd in them and that power which is left to the wise just and good upon a supposition that they will not make an ill use of it must be devolv'd to those who will not or cannot make a good one but will either maliciously turn it to the destruction of those they ought to protect or thro weakness suffer it to fall into the hands of those that govern them who are found by experience to be for the most part the worst of all most apt to use the basest arts and to flatter the humors and foment the vices that are most prevalent in weak and vicious Princes  Germanicus Corbulo Valerius Asiaticus Thraseas Soranus Helvidius Priscus Julius Agricola  and other excellent men liv'd in the times of  Tiberius Caligula Claudius  and  Nero  but the power was put into the hands of  Sejanus Macro Tigellinus  and other Villains like to them and I wish there were not too many modern examples to shew that weak and vicious Princes will never chuse such as shall preserve Nations from the mischiefs that would ensue upon their own incapacity or malice but that they must be impos'd upon them by some other power or Nations be ruin'd for want of them This imposition must be by Law or by Force But as Laws are made to keep things in good order without the necessity of having recourse to force it would be a dangerous extravagance to arm that Prince with force which probably in a short time must be oppos'd by force and those who have bin guilty of this error as the Kingdoms of the East and the antient  Roman  Empire where no provision was made by Law against illgoverning Princes have found no other remedy than to kill them when by extreme sufferings they were driven beyond patience and this fell out so often that few of their Princes were observ'd to die by a common death But since the Empire was transmitted to  Germany  and the Emperors restrain'd by I aws that Nation has never bin brought to the odious extremitys of suffering all manner of Indignitys or revenging them upon the heads of Princes And if the Pope had not disturb'd 'em upon the account of Religion nor driven their Princes to disturb others they might have pass'd many ages without any civil Dissension and all their Emperors might have liv'd happily and dy'd peaceably as most of them have done  This might be sufficient to my purpose for if all Princes without distinction whether good or bad wise or foolish young or old sober or mad cannot be intrusted with an unlimited power and if the power they have ought to be limited by Law that Nations may not with danger to themselves as well as to the Prince have recourse to the last remedy this Law must be given to all and the good can be no otherwise distinguish'd from the bad and the wise from the foolish than by the observation or violation of it But I may justly go a step farther and affirm that this Law  which by restraining the Lusts of the vicious and foolish frequently preserves them from the destruction they would bring upon themselves or people and sometimes upon both is an assistance and direction to the wisest and best so that they also as well as the Nations under them are gainers by it This will appear strange only to those who know not  Quam grave intolerandum sit cuncta regendi onus  Tacit  how difficult and insupportable the Government of great Nations is  and how unable the best man is to bear it And if it surpass the strength of the best it may easily be determin'd how ordinary men will behave themselves under it or what use the worst will make of it I know there have bin wise and good Kings but they had not an absolute Power nor would have accepted it tho it had bin offer'd much less can I believe that any of them would have transmitted such a power to their posterity when none of them could know any more than  Solomon  whether his Son would be a wise man or a fool But if the best might have desir'd and had bin able to bear it tho  Moses  by his own confession was not that could be no reason why it should be given to the worst and weakest or those who probably will be so Since the assurance that it will not be abus'd during the life of one man is nothing to the constitution of a State which aims at perpetuity And no man knowing what men will be especially if they come to the power by succession which may properly enough be call'd by chance 'tis reasonably to be fear'd they will be bad and consequently necessary so to limit their power that if they prove to be so the Commonwealth may not be destroy'd which they were instituted to preserve The Law provides for this in leaving to the King a full and ample power of doing as much good as his heart can wish and in restraining his power so that if he should depart from the duty of his Office the Nation may not perish This is a help to those who are wise and good by directing them what they are to do more certainly than any one man's personal judgment can do and no prejudice at all since no such man did ever complain he was not suffer'd to do the evil which he would abhor if it were in his power and is a most necessary curb to the fury of bad Princes preventing them from bringing destruction upon the people Men are so subject to vices and passions that they stand in need of some restraint in every condition but most especially when they are in power The rage of a private man may be pernicious to one or a few of his Neighbours but the fury of an unlimited Prince would drive whole Nations into ruin And those very men who have liv'd modestly when they had little power have often prov'd the most savage of all Monsters when they thought nothing able to resist their rage 'Tis said of  Caligula  that no man ever knew  Nec meliorem servum nec deteriorem dominum  a better Servant nor a worse Master  The want of restraint made him a Beast who might have continu'd to be a Man And tho I cannot say that our Law necessarily admits the next in Blood to the Succession for the contrary is prov'd yet the facility of our Ancestors in receiving children women or such men as were not more able than themselves to bear the weight of a Crown convinces me fully that they had so fram'd our Laws that even children women or ill men might either perform as much as was necessarily requir'd of 'em or be brought to reason if they transgrest and arrogated to themselves more than was allow'd For 'tis not to be imagin'd  that a company of men should so far degenerate from their own Nature which is Reason to give up themselves and their Posterity with all their concernments in the world to depend upon the will of a child a woman an ill man or a fool  If therefore Laws are necessary to popular States they are no less to Monarchys or rather that is not a State or Government which has them not and 'tis no less impossible for any to subsist without 'em than for the body of a man to be and perform its functions without Nerves or Bones And if any People had ever bin so foolish to establish that which they call'd a Government without Laws to support and regulate it the impossibility of subsisting would evidence the madness of the Constitution and ought to deter all others from following their example  'Tis no less incredible that those Nations which rejected Kings did put themselves into the Power of one man to prescribe to 'em such Laws as he pleas'd But the instances alledg'd by our Author are evidently false The  Athenians  were not without Laws when they had Kings  Aegeus  was subject to the Laws and did nothing of importance without the consent of the People and  Theseus  not being able to please them dy'd a banish'd man  Draco  and  Solon  did not make but propose Laws and  Plut vit Solon  they were of no force till establish'd by the Authority of the People The  Spartans  dealt in the same manner with  Lycurgus  he invented their Laws but the People made them and when the Assembly of all the Citizens had approv'd and sworn to observe them till his return from  Crete  he resolv'd rather to die in a voluntary banishment than by his return to absolve them from the Oath they had taken The  Romans  also had Laws during the Government of their Kings but not finding in 'em that Perfection they desir'd the  Decemviri  were chosen to frame others which yet were of no value till they were pass'd by the People in the  Ingenti hominum consensu propositis decem Tabulis Populum ad concionem convocarunt quod bonum faustum foelix{que} sit Reipublicae ipsis liberis{que} eorum esset ire legere propositas jussere  T Liv l    Comitia Centuriata  and being so approv'd they were establish'd But this Sanction to which every man whether Magistrate or private Citizen was subject did no way bind the whole body of the People who still retain'd in themselves the Power of changing both the matter and the form of their Government as appears by their instituting and abrogating Kings Consuls Dictators Tribuns with consular Power and  Decemviri  when they thought good for the Commonwealth And if they had this Power I leave our Author to shew why the like is not in other Nations  SECT XIV Laws are not made by Kings not because they are busy'd in greater matters than doing Justice but because Nations will be govern'd by Rule and not Arbitrarily  OUR Author pursuing the mistakes to which he seems perpetually condemn'd says that  when Kings were either busy'd in War or distracted with publick Cares so that every private man could not have access unto their Persons to learn their Wills and Pleasures then of necessity were Laws invented that so every particular Subject might find his Prince's Pleasure  I have often heard that Governments were establish'd for the obtaining of Justice and if that be true 'tis hard to imagin what business a supreme Magistrate can have to divert him from accomplishing the principal end of his Institution And 'tis as commonly said that this distribution of Justice to a People is a work surpassing the strength of any one  Exod  man  Jethro  seems to have bin a wise man and 'tis probable he thought  Moses  to be so also but he found the work of judging the People to be too heavy for him and therefore advis'd him to leave the judgment of Causes to others who should be chosen for that purpose which advice  Moses  accepted and God approv'd The governing power was as insupportable to him as the Judicial He desir'd rather to dy than to bear so great a burden and God neither accusing him of sloth or impatience gave him seventy Assistants But if we may believe our Author the Powers Judicial and Legislative that of judging as well as that of governing is not too much for any man woman or child whatsoever and that he stands in no need either of God's Statutes to direct him or Man's Counsel to assist him unless it be when he is otherwise employ'd and his Will alone is sufficient for all But what if he be not busy'd in greater matters or distracted with publick cares is every Prince capable of this work Tho  Moses  had not found it too great for him or it should be granted that a man of excellent natural Endowments great Wisdom Learning Experience Industry and Integrity might perform it is it certain that all those who happen to be born in reigning Familys are so If  Moses  had the Law of God before his eyes and could repair to God himself for the application or explanation of it have all Princes the same Assistance Do they all speak with God face to face or can they do what he did without the Assistance he had If all Kings of mature years are of that perfection are we assur'd that none shall dy before his Heir arrive to the same Or shall he have the same ripeness of Judgment in his Infancy If a Child come to a Crown dos that immediately infuse the most admirable Endowments and Graces Have we any promise from Heaven that Women shall enjoy the same Prerogatives in those Countrys where they are made capable of the Succession Or dos that Law which renders them capable not only defend them against the frailty of their own Nature but confer the most sublime vertues upon them But who knows not that no Familys do more frequently produce weak or ill men than the greatest and that which is worse their greatness is a snare to  them so that they who in a low condition might have pass'd unregarded being advanc'd to the highest have often appear'd to be or became the worst of all Beasts and they who advance them are like to them For if the Power be in the Multitude as our Author is forc'd to confess otherwise the  Athenians  and  Romans  could not have given all as he says nor a part as I say to  Draco Solon  or the  Decemviri  they must be Beasts also who should have given away their Right and Liberty in hopes of receiving Justice from such as probably will neither understand nor regard it or protection from those who will not be able to help themselves and expect such Vertue Wisdom and Integrity should be and for ever remain in the Family they set up as was never known to continue in any If the Power be not confer'd upon them they have it not and if they have it not their want of leisure to do Justice cannot have bin the cause for which Laws are made and they cannot be the signification of their Will but are that to which the Prince ows obedience as well as the meanest Subject This is that which  Bracton  calls  esse sub lege  and says that  Rex in regno superiores habet Deum Legem Fortescue  says The Kings of  England  cannot change the Laws and indeed they are so far from having any such Power that the Judges swear to have no regard to the King's Letters or Commands but if they receive any to proceed according to Law as if they had not bin And the breach of this Oath dos not only bring a blemish upon their Reputation but exposes them to capital Punishments as many of them have found 'Tis not therefore the King that makes the Law but the Law that makes the King It gives the rule for Succession making Kingdoms sometimes Hereditary and sometimes Elective and more often than either simply Hereditary under condition In some places Males only are capable of inheriting in others Females are admitted Where the Monarchy is regular as in  Germany England  c the Kings can neither make nor change Laws They are under the Law and the Law is not under them their Letters or Commands are not to be regarded In the administration of Justice the question is not what pleases them but what the Law declares to be right which must have its course whether the King be busy or at leisure whether he will or not The King who never dys is always present in the supreme Courts and neither knows nor regards the pleasure of the man that wears the Crown But lest by his Riches and Power he might have some influence upon judicial Proceedings the  great Charter  that recapitulates and acknowledges our antient inherent Libertys obliges him to swear that he will neither sell delay nor deny Justice to any man according to the Laws of the Land which were ridiculous and absurd if those Laws were only the signification of his Pleasure or any way depended upon his Will This Charter having bin confirm'd by more than thirty Parliaments all succeeding Kings are under the obligation of the same Oath or must renounce the benefit they receive from our Laws which if they do they will be sound to be equal to every one of us  Our Author according to his custom having laid down a false proposition gos about to justify it by misapplying the examples of  Draco Solon  the  Decemviri  and  Moses  of whom no one had the Power he attributes to them and it were nothing to us if they had The  Athenians  and  Romans  as was said before were so far from resigning the absolute Power without appeal to themselves that nothing done by their Magistrats was os any force till it was enacted by the People And the  power given to the  Decemviri sine provocatione  was only in private cases there being no superior Magistrate then in being to whom Appeals could be made They were vested with the same Power the Kings and Dictators enjoy'd from whom there lay no Appeal but to the People and always to them as appears by the case of  Horatius  in the time of  Tullus Hostilius  that of  Marcus Fabius  when  Papyrius Cursor  was Dictator and of  Nenius  the Tribun when  Q Fabius Maximus  was in the same Office all which I have cited already and refer to them There was therefore a reservation of the supreme Power in the People notwithstanding the creation of Magistrats without Appeal and as it was quietly exercis'd in making Strangers or whom they pleas'd Kings restraining the power of Dictators to six months and that of the  Decemviri  to two years when the last did contrary to Law endeavour by force to continue their Power the People did by force destroy it and them  The case of  Moses  is yet more clear he was the most humble and gentle of all men he never rais'd his heart above his brethren and commanded Kings to live in the same modesty he never desir'd the People should depend upon his will In giving Laws to them he fulfill'd the will of God not his own and those Laws were not the signification of his will but of the will of God They were the production of God's Wisdom and Goodness not the invention of Man given to purify the People not to advance the glory of their Leader He was not proud and insolent nor pleas'd with that ostentation of Pomp to which Fools give the name of Majesty and whoever so far exalts the power of a man to make Nations depend upon his pleasure dos not only lay a burden upon him which neither  Moses  nor any other could ever bear and every wise man will always abhor but with an impious fury endeavours to set up a Government contrary to the Laws of God presumes to accuse him of want of wisdom or goodness to his own People and to correct his Errors which is a work fit to be undertaken by such as our Author  From hence as upon a solid foundation he proceeds and making use of King  James  's words infers that Kings are above the Laws because he so teaches us But he might have remember'd that having affirm'd the People could not judg of the disputes that might happen between them and Kings because they must not be judges in their own case 'tis absurd to make a King judg of a case so nearly concerning himself in the decision of which his own Passions and Interests may probably lead him into errors And if it be pretended that I do the same in giving the judgment of those matters to the People the case is utterly different both in the nature and consequences The King's judgment is merely for himself and if that were to take place all the Passions and Vices that have most power upon men would concur to corrupt it He that is set up for the publick good can have no contest with the whole People whose good he is to procure unless he deflect from the end of his Institution and set up an Interest of his own in opposition to it This is in its nature the highest os all delinquencys and if such a one may be judg of his own crimes he is not only sure to avoid punishment but to obtain all that he sought by them and the worse he is the more violent will his d  sires be to get all the power into his hands that he may grati  y his lusts and execute his pernicious designs On the other side in a popular Assembly no man judges for himself otherwise than as his good  is comprehended in that of the publick Nothing hurts him but what is prejudicial to the Commonwealth Such amongst them as may have receiv'd private injurys are so far only consider'd by others as their sufferings may have influence upon the publick if they be few and the matters not great others will not suffer their quiet to be disturb'd by them if they are many and grievous the Tyranny thereby appears to be so cruel that the Nation cannot subsist unless it be corrected or supprest Corruption of Judgment proceeds from private Passions which in these cases never govern and tho a zeal for the publick good may possibly be misguided yet till it be so it can never be capable of excess The last  Tarquin  and his leud Son exercis'd their Fury and Lust in the murders of the best men in  Rome  and the rape of  Lucretia Appius Claudius  was fill'd with the like madness  Caligula  and  Nero  were so well establish'd in the power of committing the worst of Villanys that we do not hear of any man that offer'd to defend himself or woman that presum'd to refuse them If they had bin judges in these cases the utmost of all Villanys and Mischiefs had bin establish'd by Law but as long as the judgment of these matters was in the People no private or corrupt Passion could take place  Lucius Brutus Valerius Horatius  and  Virginius  with the People that follow'd them did not by the expulsion of the Kings or the suppression of the  Decemviri  assume to themselves a power of committing Rapes and Murders nor any advantages beyond what their equals might think they deserv'd by their vertues and services to the Commonwealth nor had they more credit than others for any other reason than that they shew'd themselves most forward in procuring the publick Good and by their Valor and Conduct best able to promote it  Whatsoever happen'd after the overthrow of their Liberty belongs not to my Subject for there was nothing of popularity in the judgments that were made One Tyrant destroy'd another the same Passions and Vices for the most part reign'd in both The last was often as bad as his Predecessor whom he had overthrown and one was sometimes approv'd by the People for no other reason than that it was thought impossible for him to be worse than he who was in possession of the Power But if one instance can be of force amongst an infinite number of various Accidents the words of  Valerius Asiaticus  who by wishing he had bin the man that had kill'd  Caligula  did in a moment pacify the fury of the Soldiers who were looking for those that had done it shew that as long as men retain any thing of that Reason which is truly their Nature they never fail of judging rightly of Vertue and Vice whereas violent and ill Princes have always done the contrary and even the best do often deflect from the rules of Justice as appears not only by the examples of  Edward  the first and third who were brought to confess it but even those of  David  and  Solomon  Moreover to shew that the decision of these Controversys cannot belong to any King but to the People we are only to consider that as Kings and all other Magistrats whether supreme or subordinate are constituted only for the good of the People the People only can be fit to judg whether the end be accomplish'd A Physician dos not exercise his Art for himself but for his Patients and when I am or think I shall be sick I send for him of whom I have the best opinion that he may help me to recover or preserve my health but I lay him aside if I find him to be negligent ignorant or unfaithful and it would be ridiculous for  him to say I make my self judg in my own case for I only or such as I shall consult am fit to be the judg of it He may be treacherous and thro corruption or malice endeavour to poison me or have other defects that render him unfit to be trusted but I cannot by any corrupt passion be led wilfully to do him injustice and if I mistake 'tis only to my own hurt The like may be said of Lawyers Stewards Pilots and generally of all that do not act for themselves but for those who employ them And if a Company going to the  Indys  should find that their Pilot was mad drunk or treacherous they whose lives and goods are concern'd can only be fit to judg whether he ought to be trusted or not since he cannot have a right to destroy those he was chosen to preserve and they cannot be thought to judg perversly because they have nothing to lead them but an opinion of truth and cannot err but to their own prejudice In the like manner not only  Solon  and  Draco  but  Romulus Numa Hostilius  the Consuls Dictators and  Decemviri  were not distinguish'd from others that it might be well with them  Sed ut bonum faelix faustum{que} sit Populo Romano  but that the prosperity and happiness of the People might be procur'd which being the thing always intended it were absurd to refer the judgment of the performance to him who is suspected of a design to overthrow it and whose passions interests and vices if he has any lead him that way If King  James  said any thing contrary to this he might be answer'd with  Speech in StarChamber    some of his own words  I was  says he  sworn to maintain the Laws of the Land and therefore had bin perjur'd if I had broken them  It may also be presum'd he had not forgotten what his Master  Buchanan  had taught  Hist Scot  in the Books he wrote chiefly for his Instruction that the violation of the Laws of  Scotland  could not have bin so fatal to most of his Predecessors  De Jure Reg apud Scot  Kings of that Country nor as he himself had made them to his Mother if Kings as Kings were above them  SECT XV A general presumption that Kings will govern well is not a sufficient security to the People  BƲT  says our Author  yet will they rule their Subjects by the Law and a King governing in a settled Kingdom leaves to be a King and degenerates into a Tyrant so soon as he ceases to rule according unto his Laws Yet where he sees them rigorous or doubtful he may mitigate or interpret  This is therefore an effect of their goodness they are above Laws but will rule by Law we have  Filmer  's word for it But I know not how Nations can be assur'd their Princes will always be so good Goodness is always accompany'd with Wisdom and I do not find those admirable qualitys to be generally inherent or entail'd upon supreme Magistrats They do not seem to be all alike and we have not hitherto found them all to live in the same Spirit and Principle I can see no resemblance between  Moses  and  Caligula Joshua  and  Claudius Gideon  and  Nero Samson  and  Vitellius Samuel  and  Otho David  and  Domitian  nor indeed between the best of these and their own Children If the Sons of  Moses  and  Joshua  had bin like to them in wisdom valor and integrity 'tis probable  they had bin chosen to succeed them if they were not the like is less to be presum'd of others No man has yet observ'd the Moderation of  Gideon  to have bin in  Abimelech  the Piety of  Eli  in  Hophni  and  Phineas  the Purity and Integrity of  Samuel  in  Joel  and  Abiah  nor the Wisdom of  Solomon  in  Rehoboam  And if there was so vast a difference between them and their Children who doubtless were instructed by those excellent men in the ways of Wisdom and Justice as well by Precept as Example were it not madness to be confident that they who have neither precept nor good example to guide them but on the contrary are educated in an utter ignorance or abhorrence of all vertue will always be just and good or to put the whole power into the hands of every man woman or child that shall be born in governing Familys upon a supposition that a thing will happen which never did or that the weakest and worst will perform all that can be hop'd and was seldom accomplish'd by the wisest and best exposing whole Nations to be destroy'd without remedy if they do it not And if this be madness in all extremity 'tis to be presum'd that Nations never intended any such thing unless our Author prove that all Nations have bin mad from the beginning and must always continue to be so To cure this he says  They degenerate into Tyrants  and if he meant as he speaks it would be enough For a King cannot degenerate into a Tyrant by departing from that Law which is only the product of his own will But if he do degenerate it must be by departing from that which dos not depend upon his will and is a rule prescrib'd by a power that is above him This indeed is the Doctrin of  Bracton  who having said that the Power of the King is the Power of the Law because the Law makes him King adds  Quia si faciat injuriam definit esse Rex degenerat in tyrannum fit vicarius Diaboli  Bract  That if he do injustice he ceases to be King degenerates into a Tyrant and becomes the Vicegerent of the Devil  But I hope this must be understood with temperament and a due consideration of human frailty so as to mean only those injurys that are extreme for otherwise he would terribly shake all the Crowns of the World  But lest our Author should be thought once in his life to have dealt sincerely and spoken truth the next lines shew the fraud of his last Assertion by giving to the Prince a power of  mitigating or interpreting the Laws that he sees to be rigorous or doubtful  But as he cannot degenerate into a Tyrant by departing from the Law which proceeds from his own will so he cannot mitigate or interpret that which proceeds from a superior Power unless the right of mitigating or interpreting be confer'd upon him by the same For as all wise men confess that  Cujus est instituere ejus est abrogare  none can abrogate but those who may institute  and that all mitigation and interpretation varying from the true sense is an alteration that alteration is an abrogation for  Quicquid mutatut dissolvitur interit ergo  whatsoever is chang'd is dissolv'd and therefore the power of mitigating is inseparable from that of instituting This is sufficiently evidenc'd by  Henry  the Eighth's Answer to the Speech made to him by the Speaker of the House of Commons in which he tho one of the most violent Princes we ever had confesses the Parliament to be the Lawmakers and that an obligation lay upon him rightly to use the power with which he was entrusted The right therefore of altering  being inseparable from that of making Laws the one being in the Parliament the other must be so also  Fortescue  says plainly the King cannot change any Law  Magna Charta  casts all upon  Leges terrae Consuetudines Angliae  the Laws of the Land and Customs of  England  But to say that the King can by his will make that to be a Custom or an antient Law which is not or that not to be so which is is most absurd He must therefore take the Laws and Customs as he finds them and can neither detract from nor add any thing to them The ways are prescrib'd as well as the end Judgments are given by equals  per Pares  The Judges who may be assisting to those are sworn to proceed according to Law and not to regard the King's Letters or Commands The doubtful Cases are reserv'd and to be refer'd to the Parliament as in the Statute of  Edw    d  concerning Treasons but never to the King The Law intending that these Parliaments should be annual and leaving to the King a power of calling them more often if occasion require takes away all pretence of a necessity that there should be any other power to interpret or mitigate Laws For 'tis not to be imagin'd that there should be such a pestilent evil in any antient Law Custom or later Act of Parliament which being on the sudden discover'd may not without any great prejudice continue for forty days till a Parliament may be call'd whereas the force and essence of all Laws would be subverted if under color of mitigating and interpreting the power of altering were allow'd to Kings who often want the inclination and for the most part the capacity of doing it rightly 'Tis not therefore upon the uncertain will or understanding of a Prince that the safety of a Nation ought to depend He is sometimes a child and sometimes overburden'd with years Some are weak negligent slothful foolish or vicious others who may have something of rectitude in their intentions and naturally are not uncapable of doing well are drawn out of the right way by the subtilty of ill men who gain credit with them That rule must always be uncertain and subject to be distorted which depends upon the fancy of a man He always fluctuates and every passion that arises in his mind or is infus'd by others disorders him The good of a People ought to be establish'd upon a more solid foundation For this reason the Law is establish'd which no passion can disturb 'Tis void of desire and fear lust and anger 'Tis  Mens sine affectu  written Reason retaining some measure of the Divine Perfection It dos not enjoin that which pleases a weak frail man but without any regard to persons commands that which is good and punishes evil in all whether rich or poor high or low 'Tis deaf inexorable inflexible  By this means every man knows when he is safe or in danger because he knows whether he has done good or evil But if all depended upon the will of a man the worst would be often the most safe and the best in the greatest hazard Slaves would be often advanc'd the good and the brave scorn'd and neglected The most generous Nations have above all things sought to avoid this evil and the vertue wisdom and generosity of each may be discern'd by the right fixing of the rule that must be the guide of every man's life and so constituting their Magistracy that it may be duly observ'd Such as have attain'd to this perfection have always flourish'd in vertue and happiness They are as  Aristotle  says govern'd by God rather than by men whilst those who subjected themselves to the will of a man were govern'd by a beast  This being so our Author's next clause That  tho a King do frame all his Actions to be according unto Law yet he is not bound thereunto but as his good will and for good example or so far forth as the general Law for the safety of the Commonwealth doth naturally bind him  is wholly impertinent For if the King who governs not according to Law degenerates into a Tyrant he is oblig'd to frame his actions according to Law or not to be a King for a Tyrant is none but as contrary to him as the worst of men is to the best But if these obligations were unty'd we may easily guess what security our Author's words can be to us that the King of his own good will and for a good example will frame his actions according to the Laws when experience instructs us that notwithstanding the strictest Laws and most exquisite Constitutions that men of the best abilitys in the world could ever invent to restrain the irregular appetites of those in power with the dreadful examples of vengeance taken against such as would not be restrain'd they have frequently broken out and the most powerful have for the most part no otherwise distinguish'd themselves from the rest of men than by the enormity of their vices and being the most forward in leading others to all manner of crimes by their example  SECT XVI The observation of the Laws of Nature is absurdly expected from Tyrants who set themselves up against all Laws and he that subjects Kings to no other Law than what is common to Tyrants destroys their being  OUR Author's last clause acknowledging Kings to be bound by a general Law to provide for the safety of the People would be sufficient for my purpose if it were sincere for municipal Laws do only shew how that should be perform'd and if the King by departing from that rule degenerates as he says into a Tyrant 'tis easily determin'd what ought then to be done by the People But his whole Book being a heap of contradictions and frauds we can rely upon nothing that he says And his following words which under the same Law comprehend both Kings and Tyrants shew that he intends Kings should be no otherwise oblig'd than Tyrants which is not at all  By this means  says he  are all Kings even Tyrants and Conquerors bound to preserve the Lands Goods Libertys and Lives of all their Subjects not by any municipal Law of the Land so much as by the natural Law of a Father which obligeth them to ratify the Acts of their Forefathers and Predecessors in things necessary for the publick good of their Subjects  If he be therefore in the right Tyrants and Conquerors are Kings and Fathers The words that have bin always thought to comprehend the most irreconcilable contrariety the one expressing the most tender love and care evidently testify'd by the greatest obligations confer'd upon those who are under it the other the utmost of all injurys that can be offer'd to men signify the same thing There is no difference between a Magistrate who  is what he is by Law and a publick Enemy who by force or fraud sets himself up against all Law And what he said before that Kings degenerated into Tyrants signifys nothing for Tyrants also are Kings  His next words are no less incomprehensible for neither King nor Tyrant can be oblig'd to preserve the Lands Goods and Libertys of their Subjects if they have none But as Liberty consists only in being subject to no man's will and nothing denotes a Slave but a dependence upon the will of another if there be no other Law in a Kingdom than the will of a Prince there is no such thing as Liberty Property also is an appendage to Liberty and 'tis as impossible for a man to have a right to Lands or Goods if he has no Liberty and enjoys his Life only at the pleasure of another as it is to enjoy either when he is depriv'd of 'em He therefore who says Kings and Tyrants are bound to preserve their Subjects Lands Libertys Goods and Lives and yet lays for a foundation that Laws are no more than the significations of their Pleasure seeks to delude the world with words which signify nothing  The vanity of these Whimsys will farther appear if it be consider'd that as Kings are Kings by Law and Tyrants are Tyrants by overthrowing the Law they are most absurdly join'd together and 'tis not more ridiculous to set him above the Law who is what he is by the Law than to expect the observation of the Laws that enjoin the preservation of the Lands Libertys Goods and Lives of the People from one who by fraud or violence makes himself master of all that he may be restrain'd by no Law and is what he is by subverting all Law  Besides if the  safety of the People  be  the supreme Law  and this safety extend to and consist in the preservation of their Libertys Goods Lands and Lives that Law must necessarily be the root and beginning as well as the end and limit of all magistratical Power and all Laws must be subservient and subordinate to it The question will not then be what pleases the King but what is good for the People not what conduces to his profit or glory but what best secures the Libertys he is bound to preserve he dos not therefore reign for himself but for the People he is not the Master but the Servant of the Commonwealth and the utmost extent of his Prerogative is to be able to do more good than any private Man If this be his work and duty 'tis easily seen whether he is to judg of his own performance or they by whom and for whom he reigns and whether in order to this he be to give Laws or to receive them 'Tis ordinarily said in  France Il faut que chacun soit servi à sa mode  Every man's business must be done according to his own mind and if this be true in particular Persons 'tis more plainly so in whole Nations Many eyes see more than one the collected wisdom of a People much surpasses that of a single Person and tho he should truly seek that which is best 'tis not probable he would so easily find it as the body of a Nation or the principal men chosen to represent the whole This may be said with justice of the best and wisest Princes that ever were but another Language is to be us'd when we speak of those who may succeed and who very often thro the defects of Age Person or Sex are neither fit to judg of other mens affairs nor of their own and are so far from being capable of the highest Concernments relating to the safety of whole Nations that the most trivial cannot reasonably be refer'd to them  There are few men except such as  Filmer  who by bidding defiance to the Laws of God and Man seems to declare war against both whom I would not trust to determin whether a People that can never fall into  Nonage or Dotage and can never fail of having men of Wisdom and Vertue amongst 'em be not more fit to judg in their own Persons or by Representatives what conduces to their own good than one who at a venture may be born in a certain Family and who besides his own Infirmitys Passions Vices or Interests is continually surrounded by such as endeavour to divert him from the ways of Truth and Justice And if no reasonable man dare prefer the latter before the former we must rely upon the Laws made by our Forefathers and interpreted by the Nation and not upon the will of a man  'Tis in vain to say that a wise and good Council may supply the defects or correct the Vices of a young foolish or ill dispos'd King For  Filmer  denys that a King whatever he be without exception for he attributes profound wisdom to all is oblig'd to follow the advice of his Council and even he himself would hardly have had the impudence to say That good Counsel given to a foolish or wicked Prince were of any value unless he were oblig'd to follow it This Council must be chosen by him or impos'd upon him if it be impos'd upon him it must be by a Power that is above him which he says cannot be If chosen by one who is weak foolish or wicked it can never be good because such vertue and wisdom is requir'd to discern and chuse a few good and wise men from a multitude of foolish and bad as he has not And it will generally fall out that he will take for his Counsellors rather those he believes to be addicted to his Person or Interests than such as are fitly qualify'd to perform the duty of their places But if he should by chance or contrary to his intentions make choice of some good and wise men the matter would not be much mended for they will certainly differ in opinion from the worst And tho the Prince should intend well of which there is no assurance nor any reason to put so great a power into his hands if there be none 'tis almost impossible for him to avoid the snares that will be laid to seduce him I know not how to put a better face upon this matter for if I examin rather what is probable than possible foolish or ill Princes will never chuse such as are wise and good but favouring those who are most like to themselves will prefer such as second their vices humors and personal Interests and by so doing will rather fortify and rivet the evils that are brought upon the Nation thro their defects than cure them This was evident in  Rehoboam  he had good Counsel but he would not hearken to it We know too many of the same sort and tho it were not impossible as  Machiavelli  says it is for a weak Prince to receive any benefit from a good Council we may certainly conclude that a People can never expect any good from a Council chosen by one who is weak or vicious  If a Council be impos'd upon him and he be oblig'd to follow their advice it must be impos'd by a Power that is above him his Will therefore is not a Law but must be regulated by the Law the Monarchy is not above the Law and if we will believe our Author 'tis no Monarchy because the Monarch has not his will and perhaps he says true For if that be an Aristocracy where those that are or are reputed to be the best do govern then that is certainly a mix'd State in which the will of one man dos not prevail But if Princes are not oblig'd by the Law all that is founded upon that supposition falls to the ground They will always follow their own humors or the suggestions of those who second them  Tiberius  hearken'd to none but  Chaldeans  or the ministers of his impuritys and crueltys  Claudius  was govern'd by Slaves and the profligate  Strumpets his Wives There were many wise and good men in the Senat during the reigns of  Caligula Nero  and  Domitian  but instead of following their Counsel they endeavour'd to destroy them all lest they should head the People against them and such Princes as resemble them will always follow the like courses  If I often repeat these hateful names 'tis not for want of fresher examples of the same nature but I chuse such as Mankind has universally condemn'd against whom I can have no other cause of hatred than what is common to all those who have any love to vertue and which can have no other relation to the Controversys of later Ages than what may flow from the similitude of their causes rather than such as are too well known to us and which every man according to the measure of his experience may call to mind in reading these I may also add that as nothing is to be receiv'd as a general Maxim which is not generally true I need no more to overthrow such as  Filmer  proposes than to prove how frequently they have bin found false and what desperate mischiefs have bin brought upon the World as often as they have bin practis'd and excessive Powers put into the hands of such as had neither inclination nor ability to make a good use of them And therefore  If the safety of Nations be the end for which Governments are instituted such as take upon them to govern by what Title soever are by the Law of Nature bound to procure it and in order to this to preserve the Lives Lands Libertys and Goods of every one of their Subjects and he that upon any title whatsoever pretends assumes or exercises a power of disposing of them according to his own will violates the Laws of Nature in the highest degree  If all Princes are oblig'd by the Law of Nature to preserve the Lands Goods Lives and Libertys of their Subjects those Subjects have by the Law of Nature a right to their Libertys Lands Goods c and cannot depend upon the will of any man for that dependance destroys Liberty c  Ill men will not and weak men cannot provide for the safety of the People nay the work is of such extreme difficulty that the greatest and wisest men that have bin in the world are not able by themselves to perform it and the assistance of Counsel is of no use unless Princes are oblig'd to follow it There must be therefore a power in every State to restrain the ill and to instruct weak Princes by obliging them to follow the Counsels given else the ends of Government cannot be accomplish'd nor the rights of Nations preserv'd  All this being no more than what is said by our Author or necessarily to be deduc'd from his Propositions one would think he were become as good a Commonwealthsman as  Cato  but the wash'd Swine will return to the Mire He overthrows all by a preposterous conjunction of the rights of Kings which are just and by Law with those of Tyrants which are utterly against Law and gives the sacred and gentle name of Father to those Beasts who by their actions declare themselves enemys not only to all Law and Justice but to Mankind that cannot subsist without them This requires no other proof than to examin whether  Attila  or  Tamerlan  did well deserve to be call'd Fathers of the Countrys they destroy'd The first of these was usually call'd the scourge of God and he glory'd in the Name The other being reprov'd for the detestable crueltys he    exercis'd made answer  You speak to me as to a man I am not a man but the scourge of God and plague of Mankind  This is certainly sweet and  gentle Language savouring much of a fatherly tenderness There is no doubt that those who use it will provide for the safety of the Nations under them and the preservation of the Laws of Nature is rightly refer'd to them and 'tis also very probable that they who come to burn the Countrys and destroy the Nations that fall under their power should make it their business to preserve them and look upon the former Governors  as their Fathers whose Acts they are oblig'd to confirm  tho they seldom attain to the Dominion by any other means than the slaughter of them and their Familys  But if the enmity be not against the Nation and the cause of the war be only for Dominion against the ruling Person or Family as that of  Baasha  against the house of  Jeroboam  of  Zimri  against that of  Baasha  of  Omri  against  Zimri  and of  Jehu  against  Joram  the prosecution of it is a strange way of becoming the Son of the Person destroy'd And  Filmer  alone is subtil enough to discover that  Jehu  by extinguishing the house of  Ahab  drew an obligation upon himself of looking on him as his Father and confirming his acts If this be true  Moses  was oblig'd to confirm the acts of the Kings of the  Amalekites Moabites  and  Amorites  that he destroy'd the same duty lay upon  Joshua  in relation to the  Canaanites  but 'tis not so easily decided to which of them he did owe that deference for the same could not be due to all and 'tis hard to believe that by killing above thirty Kings he should purchase to himself so many Fathers and the like may be said of divers others  Moreover there is a sort of Tyrant who has no Father as  Agathocles Dionysius Cesar  and generally all those who subvert the Libertys of their own Country And if they stood oblig'd to look upon the former Magistrats as their Predecessors and to confirm their Acts the first should have bin to give impunity and reward to any that would kill them it having bin a fundamental Maxim in those States  Uni  ui{que} licere Tyrannum occidere  That any man might kill a Tyrant  This being in all respects ridiculous and absurd 'tis evident that our Author who by proposing such a false security to Nations for their Libertys endeavours to betray them is not less treacherous to Kings when under a pretence of defending their Rights he makes them to be the same with those of Tyrants who are known to have none and are Tyrants because they have none and gives no other hopes to Nations of being preserv'd by the Kings they set up for that end than what upon the same account may be expected from Tyrants whom all wise men have ever abhor'd and affirm'd to have bin  produc'd  In generis humani exitium natos  to bring destruction upon the World  and whose Lives have verify'd the Sentence  This is truly to depose and abolish Kings by abolishing that by which and for which they are so The greatness of their Power Riches State and the pleasures that accompany them cannot but create enemys Some will envy that which is accounted Happiness others may dislike the use they make of their Power some may be unjustly exasperated by the best of their Actions when they find themselves incommoded by them others may be too severe judges of slight miscarriages These things may reasonably temper the joys of those who delight most in the advantages of Crowns But the worst and most dangerous of all their enemys are these accursed Sycophants who by making those that ought to be the best of men like to the worst destroy their Being and by persuading the world they aim at the same things and are bound to no other rule than is common to all Tyrants give a fair pretence to ill men to say They are all of  one kind And if this should be receiv'd for truth even they who think the miscarriages of their Governors may be easily redrest and desire no more would be the most fierce in procuring the destruction of that which is naught in Principle and cannot be corrected  SECT XVII Kings cannot be the Interpreters of the Oaths they take  OUR Author's Book is so full of absurditys and contradictions that it would be a rope of Sand if a continu'd series of frauds did not like a string of Poisons running thro the whole give it some consistence with it self and shew it to be the work of one and the same hand After having endeavour'd to subvert the Laws of God Nature and Nations most especially our own by abusing the Scriptures falsly alledging the Authority of many good Writers and seeking to obtrude upon Mankind a universal Law that would take from every Nation the right of constituting such Governments within themselves as seem most convenient for them and giving rules for the administration of such as they had establish'd he gives us a full view of his Religion and Morals by destroying the force of the Oath taken by our Kings at their Coronation  Others  says he  affirm that altho Laws of themselves do not bind Kings yet the Oaths of Kings at their Coronation ty them to keep all the Laws of their Kingdoms How far this is true let us but examin the Oath of the Kings of  England  at their Coronation the words whereof are these Art thou pleas'd to cause to be administer'd in all thy judgments indifferent and upright Justice and to use discretion with Mercy and Verity Art thou pleas'd that our upright Laws and Customs be observ'd and dost thou promise that those shall be protected and maintain'd by thee  c To which the King  answers in the Affirmative being first demanded by the Archbishop of  Canterbury  Pleaseth it you to confirm and observe the Laws and Customs of the antient times granted from God by just and devout Kings unto the English Nation by Oath unto the said People especially the Laws Libertys and Customs granted unto the Clergy and Laity by the famous King  Edward From this he infers That the King  is not to observe all Laws but such as are upright because he finds evil Laws mention'd in the Oath of  Richard  the  d  which he swears to abolish Now what Laws are upright and what evil who shall judg but the King c So that in effect the King doth swear to keep no Laws but such as in his judgment are upright c And if he did strictly swear to observe all Laws he could not without Perjury give his consent to the repealing or abrogating of any Statute by Act of Parliament  c And again  But let it be suppos'd for Truth the Kings do swear to observe all Laws of their Kingdoms yet no man can think it reason that the Kings should be more bound by their voluntary Oaths than common Persons Now if a private Person make a Contract either with Oath or without Oath he is no farther bound than the equity and justice of the Contract tys him for a man may have relief against an unreasonable and unjust Promise if either deceit or error force or fear induc'd him thereunto or if it be hurtful or grievous in the performance since the Law in many cases gives the King a Prerogative above common persons  Lest I should be thought to insist upon small advantages I will not oblige any man to shew where  Filmer  found this Oath nor observe the faults committed in the Translation but notwithstanding his false representation I find enough for my purpose and intend to take it in his own words  But first I shall take leave to remark that those who for private interests addict themselves to the personal service of Princes tho to the ruin of their Country find it impossible to persuade Mankind that Kings may govern as they please when all men know there are Laws to direct and restrain them unless they can make men believe they have their power from a universal and superior Law or that Princes can attempt to dissolve the obligations laid upon them by the Laws which they so solemnly swear to observe without rendring themselves detestable to God and Man and subject to the revenging hands of both unless they can invalidate those Oaths Mr  Hobbes  I think was the first who very ingeniously contriv'd  Lib de Cive▪  a compendious way of justifying the most abominable Perjurys and all the mischiefs ensuing thereupon by pretending that as the King's Oath is made to the People the People may absolve him from the obligation and that the People having confer'd upon him all the Power they had he can do all that they could he can therefore absolve himself and is actually free since he is so when he pleases This is only false in the minor for the People not having confer'd upon him all but only a part of their Power that of absolving him remains in themselves otherwise they would never have oblig'd him to take the Oath He cannot therefore absolve himself The Pope indeed finds a help for this and as Christ's Vicar pretends the power of Absolution to be in him and exercis'd it in absolving K  John  But our Author despairing to impose either of these upon our Age and Nation with more impudence and less wit would enervate all CoronationOaths by subjecting them to the discretion of the taker whereas all men have hitherto thought their force to consist in the declar'd sense of those who give them This doctrin is so new that it surpasses the subtilty of the Schoolmen who as an ingenious Person said of 'em had minc'd Oaths so fine that a million of 'em as well as Angels may stand upon the point of a needle and were never yet equal'd but by the Jesuits who have overthrown them by mental reservations which is so clearly demonstrated from their books that it cannot be deny'd but so horrible that even those of their own Order who have the least spark of common honesty condemn the practice And one of them being a Gentleman of a good family told me he would go the next day and take all the Oaths that should be offer'd if he could satisfy his conscience in using any manner of equivocation or mental reservation that he might put any other sense upon them than he knew to be intended by those who offer'd them And if our Author's conscience were not more corrupted than that of the Jesuit who had liv'd fisty years under the worst Disciplin that I think ever was in the world I would ask him seriously if he truly believe that the Nobility Clergy and Commonalty os  England  who have bin always so zealous for their antient Laws and so resolute in defending 'em did mean no more by the Oaths they so solemnly impos'd and upon which they laid so much weight than that the King should swear to keep 'em so far only as he should think fit  But  he swears only to observe those that are upright  c How can that be understood otherwise than that those who give the Oath do declare their Laws and Customs to be upright and good and he by taking the Oath affirms them to be so Or how can they be more precisely specify'd than by the ensuing Clause  Granted from God by just and devout Kings by Oath especially those os the samous King  Edward But says he by the same Oath  Richard the  d  was bound to abolish those that were evil  I  any such had  ept in  hro error or bin obtruded by malice the evil being discover'd  and declar'd by the Nobility and Commons who were concern'd he was not to take advantage of them or by his refusal to evade the abolition but to join with his people in annulling them according to the general Clause of assenting to those  Quas vulgus elegerit  Magna Charta  being only an abridgment of our antient Laws and Customs the King that swears to it swears to them all and not being admitted to be the interpreter of it or to determin what is good or evil fit to be observ'd or annul'd in it can have no more power over the rest This having bin confirm'd by more Parliaments than we have had Kings since that time the same obligation must still lie upon them all as upon  John  and  Henry  in whose time that claim of right was compil'd The Act was no less solemn than important and the most dreadful curses that could be conceiv'd in words which were denounc'd against such as should any way infringe it by the Clergy in  WestminsterHall  in the presence and with the assent of K  Henry  III many of the principal Nobility and all the Estates of the Kingdom shew whether it was refer'd to the King's Judgment or not when 'tis evident they fear'd the violation from no other than himself and such as he should employ I confess the Church as they then call'd the Clergy was fallen into such corruption that their Arms were not much to be fear'd by one who had his conscience clear but that could not be in the case of perjury and our Ancestors could do no better than to imploy the spiritual sword reserving to themselves the use of the other in case that should be despis'd Tho the Pope's Excommunications prov'd sometimes to be but  bruta fulmina  when a just cause was wanting it may be easily judg'd what obedience a Prince could expect from his Subjects when every man knew he had by perjury drawn the most heavy curses upon himself K  John  was certainly wicked but he durst not break these bonds till he had procur'd the Pope's absolution for a cover and when he had done so he found himself unsafe under it and could not make good what he had promis'd to the Pope to obtain it the Parliament declaring that his grants to the Pope were unjust illegal contrary to his CoronationOath and that they would not be held by them This went so far in that King's time that Writs were issued out to men of all conditions to oblige themselves by oath to keep the great Charter and if other means sail'd  Er quod ipsum Regem per captionem distringerent gravarent ad prafata exequenda  to compel the King to perform the conditions  'Tis expresly said in his Charter  Et ip  Barones cum Communitate totius terra distringent gravabunt nos modis omnibus qui  us poterunt sci  cet per captionem castrorum terrarum pos  e  sionum aliis modis quibus potuerint don  emendatum  uerit secundum arbitrium cor  m  "That the Barons and Commonalty of the land shall straiten and compel us by all means possible as by seizing our Towns Lands and Possessions or any other way till satisfaction be made according to their pleasure"  And in the Charter of his Son  Henry  'tis upon the same supposition of not performing the agreement said  Licet omnibus de regno nostro contra no  nsurg  re omni  a  ere qu  gravamen nostrum re  piciant▪ a  s  nobi  n nul  ten  rentur  "It shall be lawful for all men in our Kingdom to rise up against us and to do all things that may be grievous to us as if they were absolutely free from any engagements to our person"  These words seem to have bin contriv'd to be so full and strong  propter duplicitatem Regis  which was with too much reason suspected And 'tis not as I suppose the language of Slaves and Villains begging something srom their Lord but of noble and free men who knew their Lord was  no more than what they made him and had nothing but what they gave him nor the language of a Lord treating with such as enjoy'd their libertys by his favor but with those whom he acknowledg'd to be the Judges of his performing what had bin stipulated and equals the agreements made between the Kings and People of  Arragon  which I cited before from the Relations of  Antonio Perez  This is as far as men can go and the experience of all ages manifests that Princes performing their office and observing these Stipulations have liv'd glorious happy and belov'd and I can hardly find an example of any who have notoriously broken these Oaths and bin adjudg'd to have incur'd the Penaltys who have not liv'd miserably dy'd shamefully and left an abominable memory to posterity  "But says our Author Kings cannot be more oblig'd by voluntary Oaths than other men and may be reliev'd from unjust and unreasonable promises if they be induc'd by deceit error force or fear or the performance be grievous"  Which is to say that no Oath is of any obligation for there is none that is not voluntary or involuntary and there never was any upon which some such thing may not be pretended which would be the same if such as  Filmer  had the direction of their consciences who take the Oaths and of those who are to exact the performance This would soon destroy all confidence between King and People and not only unhinge the best establish'd Governments but by a detestable practice of annihilating the force of Oaths and most solemn Contracts that can be made by men overthrow all Societys that subsist by them I leave it to all reasonable men to judg how fit a work this would be for the supreme Magistrate who is advanc'd to the highest degree of human glory and happiness that he may preserve them and how that Justice for the obtaining of which Governments are constituted can be administer'd if he who is to exact it from others dos in his own person utterly subvert it and what they deserve who by such base prevarications would teach 'em to pervert and abolish the most sacred of all Contracts A worthy person of our Age was accustom'd to say that Contracts in writing were invented only to bind Villains who having no Law Justice or Truth within themselves would not keep their words unless such testimonys were given as might compel them But if our Author's Doctrin were receiv'd no contract would be of more value than a Cobweb Such as are not absolutely of a profligate conscience so far reverence the religion of an Oath to think that even those which are most unjustly and violently impos'd ought to be observ'd and  Julius Cesar  who I think was not overscrupulous when he was taken by Pyrats and set at liberty upon his word caus'd the Ransom he had promis'd to be paid to them We see the like is practis'd every day by Prisoners taken in unjust as well as just Wars And there is no honest man that would not abhor a Person who being taken by the Pyrats of  Algier  should not pay what he had promis'd for his Liberty 'Twere in vain to say they had no right of exacting or that the performance was grievous he must return to the chains or pay And tho the People of  Artois Alsatia  or  Flanders  do perhaps with reason think the King of  France  has no right to impose Oaths of Allegiance upon them no man doubts that if they chuse rather to take those Oaths than to suffer what might ensue upon their refusal they are as much bound to be faithful to him as his antient Subjects  The like may be said of promises extorted by fraud and no other example is necessary to prove they are to be perform'd than that of  Joshua  made to the  Gibeonites  They were an accursed Nation which he was commanded to destroy They came to him with lies and by deceit induc'd him to make a League with them which he ought not to have done but being made it was to be perform'd and on that account he did not only spare but defend them and the action was approv'd by God When  Saul  by a preposterous zeal violated that League the Anger of God for that breach of faith could no otherwise be appeas'd than by the death of seven of his Children This case is so full so precise and of such undoubted authority that I shall not trouble my self with any other But if we believe our man of good morals voluntary Oaths and Promises are of no more value than those gain'd by force or deceit that is to say none are of any For voluntary signifying nothing but free all human Acts are either free or not free that is from the will of the person or some impulse from without If therefore there be no force in those that are free nor in those that are not free there is none in any  No better use can be made of any  pretension of error  or that the  performance was grievous  for no man ought to be griev'd at the performance of his Contract  David  assures us that a good man performs his agreement tho he lose by it and the Lord Chancellor  Egerton  told a Gentleman who desir'd relief against his own Deed upon an Allegation that he knew not what he did when he sign'd it that he did not sit to relieve fools  But tho voluntary Promises or Oaths when to use the Lawyers language there is not a valuable consideration were of no obligation or that men brought by force fear or error into such Contracts as are grievous in the performance might be reliev'd this would not at all reach the cases of Princes in the Contracts made between them and their Subjects and confirm'd by their Oaths there being no color of force or fraud fear or error for them to alledg nor any thing to be pretended that can be grievous to perform otherwise than as it may be grievous to an ill man not to do the mischiefs he had conceiv'd  Nations according to their own will frame the Laws by which they resolve to be govern'd and if they do it not wisely the damage i only to themselves But 'tis hard to find an example of any People that did by force oblige a man to take upon him the Government of them  Gideon  was indeed much press'd by the  Israelites  to be their  ing and the Army of  Germanicus  in a Mutiny more fiercely urg'd him to be Emperor but both desisted when their Offers were refus'd If our Kings have bin more modest and our Ancestors more pertinacious in compelling them to accept the Crowns they offer'd I shall upon proof of the matter change my opinion But till that do appear I may be pardon'd if I think there was no such thing  William  the  Norman  was not by force brought into  England  but came voluntarily and desir'd to be King The Nobility Clergy and Commons propos'd the Conditions upon which they would receive him These conditions were to govern according to their antient Laws especially those that had bin granted or rather collected in the time of the famous King  Edward  Here was neither force nor fraud i  he had dislik'd the terms he might have retir'd as freely as he came But he did like them and tho he was not perhaps so modest to say with the  Addit Mat Par  brave  Saxon  King  Osfa Ad Libertatis vestrae tuitionem non meis meriti  sed solaliberalitate vestra unanimiter me convocast  s  he accepted the C  own upon the Conditions offer'd and swore upon the Evangelists to observe them Not much valuing this he pretended to govern according to  own will but finding the People would not endure it he renew'd his  Oath upon the same Evangelists and the Reliques of S  Alban  which he needed not to have done but might have departed to his Dutchy of  Normandy  if he had not lik'd the conditions or thought fit to observe them 'Tis probable he examin'd the contents of  Edward  's Laws before he  Bonas approbatas antiqu  s Regni Leges quas sancti pii Reges ejus antecessores maxime Edvardus statuit in  iolabiliter observare  swore to them and could not imagin that a free Nation which never had any other Kings than such as had bin chosen by themselves for the preservation of their Liberty and from whose liberality the best of their Kings acknowledg'd the Crowns they wore did intend to give up their Persons Libertys and Estates to him who was a stranger most especially when they would not receive him till he had sworn to the same Laws by which the others had reign'd of which one was as appears by the act of the  Conventus Pananglicus  that  Reges a Sacerdotibus senioribus Populi eligantur The Kings should be elected by the Clergy and Elders of the People  By these means he was advanc'd to the Crown to which he could have no title unless they had the right of conferring it upon him Here was therefore no force deceit or error and whatsoever equity there might be to relieve one that had bin forc'd frighted or circumvented it was nothing to this case We do not find that  William  the  d  or  Henry  were forc'd to be Kings no Sword was put to their Throats and for any thing we know the  English  Nation was not then so contemptible but men might have bin found in the world who would willingly have accepted the Crown and even their elder Brother  Robert  would not have refus'd but the Nobility and Commons trusting to their Oaths and Promises thought fit to prefer them before him and when he endeavour'd to impose himself upon the Nation by force they so severely punish'd him that no better proof can be requir'd to shew they were accustom'd to have no other Kings than such as they approv'd And this was one of the Customs that all their Kings swore to maintain it being as antient just and well approv'd as any other  Having already prov'd that all the Kings we have had since that time have come in upon the same title that the  Saxon  Laws to which all have sworn continue to be of force amongst us and that the words pronounc'd four times on the four sides of the Scaffold by the Archbishop  Will ye have this Man to reign  do testify it I may spare the pains of a repetition and justly conclude That if there was neither force nor fraud fear nor error to be pretended by the first there could be none in those that follow'd  But the  observation of this Oath may be grievous  If I receiv'd mony the last year upon Bond Promise or sale of a Mannor or Farm can it be thought grievous to me to be compel'd to repay or make over the Land according to my agreement Or if I did not seal the Bond till I had the mony must not I perform the condition or at the least restore what I had receiv'd If it be grievous to any King to preserve the Libertys Lives and Estates of his Subjects and to govern according to their Laws let him resign the Crown and the People to whom the Oath was made will probably release him Others may possibly be found who will not think it grievous or if none will accept a Crown unless they may do what they please the People must bear the misfortune of being oblig'd to govern themselves or to institute some other sort of Magistracy that will be satisfy'd with a less exorbitant Power Perhaps they may  succeed as well as some others have done who without being brought to that necessity have voluntarily cast themselves into the misery of living without the majestick splendor of a Monarch or if that fail they may as their last refuge surrender up themselves to Slavery When that is done we will acknowledg that whatsoever we have is deriv'd from the favor of our Master But no such thing yet appearing amongst us we may be pardon'd if we think we are Freemen govern'd by our own Laws and that no man has a Power over us which is not given and regulated by them nor that any thing but a new Law made by our selves can exempt our Kings from the obligation of performing their Oaths taken to govern according to the old in the true sense of the words as they are understood in our Language by those who give them and conducing to the ends for which they are given which can be no other than to defend us from all manner of arbitrary Power and to fix a rule to which we are to conform our Actions and from which according to our deserts we may expect reward or punishment And those who by prevarications cavils or equivocations endeavour to dissolve these Obligations do either maliciously betray the cause of Kings by representing them to the world as men who prefer the satisfaction of their irregular Appetites before the performance of their duty and trample under foot the most sacred bonds of human Society or from the grossest ignorance do not see that by teaching Nations how little they can rely upon the Oaths of their Princes they instruct them as little to observe their own and that not only because men are generally inclin'd to follow the examples of those in power but from a most certain conclusion that he who breaks his part of a Contract cannot without the utmost impudence and folly expect the performance of the other nothing being more known amongst men than that all Contracts are of such mutual obligation that he who fails of his part discharges the other If this be so between man and man it must needs be so between one and many millions of men If he were free because he says he is every man must be free also when he pleases if a private man who receives no benefit or perhaps prejudice from a Contract be oblig'd to perform the conditions much more are Kings who receive the greatest advantages the world can give As they are not by themselves nor for themselves so they are not different  in specie  from other men they are born live and die as we all do The same Law of Truth and Justice is given to all by God and Nature and perhaps I may say the performance of it is most rigorously exacted from the greatest of men The liberty of Perjury cannot be a privilege annex'd to Crowns and 'tis absurd to think that the most venerable Authority that can be confer'd upon a man is increas'd by a liberty to commit or impunity in committing such crimes as are the greatest aggravations of infamy to the basest villains in the world  SECT XVIII The next in blood to deceas'd Kings cannot generally be said to be Kings till they are crown'd  'TIS hereupon usually objected that Kings do not come in by Contract nor by Oath but are Kings by or according to proximity of Blood before they are crown'd Tho this be a bold Proposition I will not say 'tis universally false 'Tis possible that in some places the rule of Succession may be set down so precisely that in some cases every man may be able to see and know the sense as well as the Person design'd to be the Successor but before I acknowledg it to be universally true I must desire to know what this rule of Succession is and from whence it draws its original  I think I may be excus'd if I make these scruples because I find the thing in dispute to be variously adjudg'd in several places and have observ'd five different manners of disposing Crowns esteem'd Hereditary besides an infinite number of collateral Controversys arising from them of which we have divers examples and if there be one universal rule appointed one of these only can be right and all the others must be vicious The first gives the inheritance to the eldest Male of the eldest legitimate Line as in  France  according to that which they call the  Salique Law  The second to the eldest legitimate Male of the reigning Family as antiently in  Spain  according to which the Brother of the deceas'd King has bin often if not always prefer'd before the Son if he were elder as may appear by the dispute between  Corbis  and  Orsua  cited before  rom  Titus Livius  and in the same Country during the reign of the  Goths  the eldest Male succeeded whether Legitimate or Illegitimate The fourth receives Females or their Descendents without any other condition distinguishing them from Males except that the younger Brother is prefer'd before the elder Sister but the daughter of the elder Brother is prefer'd before the Son of the younger The fifth gives the Inheritance to Females under a condition as in  Sweden  where they inherit unless they marry out of the Country without the consent of the Estates according to which rule  Charles Gustavus  was chosen as any Stranger might have bin tho Son to a Sister of  Gustavus Adolphus  who by marrying a  German  Prince had forfeited her right And by the same act of Estates by which her eldest Son was chosen and the Crown entail'd upon the Heirs of his Body her second Son the Prince  Adolphus  was wholly excluded  Till these questions are decided by a Judg of such undoubted Authority that all men may safely submit 'tis hard for any man who really seeks the satisfaction of his Conscience to know whether the Law of God and Nature tho he should believe there is one general Law do justify the Customs of the antient  Medis levibus{que} Sabaeis  Imperat hic sexus Reginarum{que} sub armis  Barbaries pars magna jacet  Lucan  Medes  and  Sabeans  mention'd by the Poet who admitted Females or those of  France  which totally exclude them  as unfit to reign over men and utterly unable to perform the duty of a supreme Magistrate as we see they are every where excluded from the exercise of all other Offices in the Commonwealth If it be said that we ought to follow the Customs of our own Country I answer that those of our own Country deserve to be observ'd because they are of our own Country But they are no more to be call'd the Laws of God and Nature than those of  France  or  Germany  and tho I do not believe that any general Law is appointed I wish I were sure that our Customs in this point were not more repugnant to the light of Nature and prejudicial to our selves than those of some other Nations But if I should be so much an  English  man to think the will of God to have bin more particularly reveal'd to our Ancestors than to any other Nation and that all of them ought to learn from us yet it would be difficult to decide many questions that may arise For tho the Parliament in the  th  of  Henry  the sixth made an Act in favour of  Richard  Duke of  York  descended from a Daughter of  Mortimer  who marry'd the Daughter of the Duke of  Clarence  elder Brother to  John  of  Gaunt  they rather asserted their own power of giving the Crown to whom they pleas'd than determin'd the question For if they had believ'd that the Crown had belong'd to him by a general and eternal Law they must immediately have rejected  Henry  as a Usurper and put  Richard  into the possession of his Right which they did not And tho they did something like to this in the cases of  Maud  the Empress in relation to King  Stephen  and her Son  Henry  the  d  and of  Henry  the  th  in relation to the house of  York  both before he had marry'd a Daughter of it and after her death they did the contrary in the cases of  William  the first and second  Henry  the  st Stephen John Richard  the  d Henry  the  th Mary Elizabeth  and others So that for any thing I can yet find 'tis equally difficult to discover the true sense of the Law of Nature that should be a guide to my Conscience whether I so far submit to the Laws of my Country to think that  England  alone has produc'd men that rightly understand it or examin the Laws and Practices of other Nations  Whilst this remains undecided 'tis impossible for me to know to whom I owe the obedience that is exacted from me If I were a  French  man I could not tell whether I ow'd allegiance to the King of  Spain  Duke of  Lorrain  Duke of  Savoy  or many others descended from Daughters of the House of  Valois  one of whom ought to inherit if the Inheritance belongs to Females or to the house of  Bourbon  whose only title is founded upon the exclusion of them The like Controversys will be in all places and he that would put Mankind upon such inquirys goes about to subvert all the Governments of the World and arms every man to the destruction of his neighbor  We ought to be inform'd when this right began If we had the Genealogy of every man from  Noah  and the Crowns of every Nation had since his time continu'd in one Line we were only to inquire into how many Kingdoms he appointed the World to be divided and how well the division we see at this day agrees with the allotment made by him But Mankind having for many ages lain under such a vast confusion that no man pretends to know his own original except some  Jews  and the Princes of the house of  Austria  we cannot so easily arrive at the end of our work and the Scriptures making no other mention of this part of the world than what may induce us to think it was given to the Sons of  Japhet  we have nothing that can lead us to guess how it was to be subdivided  nor to whom the several parcels were given So that the difficultys are absolutely inextricable and tho it were true that some one man had a right to every parcel that is known to us it could be of no use for that Right must necessarily perish which no man can prove nor indeed claim But as all natural Rights by Inheritance must be by Descent this Descent not being prov'd there can be no natural Right and all Rights being either natural created or acquir'd this Right to Crowns not being natural must be created or acquir'd or none at all  There being no general Law common to all Nations creating a Right to Crowns as has bin prov'd by the several methods us'd by several Nations in the disposal of them according to which all those that we know are enjoy'd we must seek the Right concerning which we dispute from the particular Constitutions of every Nation or we shall be able to find none  Acquir'd Rights are obtain'd as men say either by fair means or by foul that is by force or by consent such as are gain'd by force may be recover'd by force and the extent of those that are enjoy'd by consent can only be known by the reasons for which or the conditions upon which that consent was obtain'd that is to say by the Laws of every People According to these Laws it cannot be said that there is a King in every Nation before he is crown'd  John Sobietski  now reigning in  Poland  had no relation in blood to the former Kings nor any title till he was chosen The last King of  Sweden  acknowledg'd he had none but was freely elected and the Crown being confer'd upon him and the Heirs of his Body if the present King dies without Issue the right of electing a Successor returns undoubtedly to the Estates of the Country The Crown of  Denmark  was Elective till it was made Hereditary by an Act of the General Diet held at  Copenhagen  in the year and 'tis impossible that a Right should otherwise accrue to a younger Brother of the house of  Holstein  which is deriv'd from a younger Brother of the Counts of  Oldenburgh  The  Roman  Empire having pass'd thro the hands of many Persons of different Nations no way relating to each other in blood was by  Constantine  transfer'd to  Constantinople  and after many Revolutions coming to  Theodosius  by birth a  Spaniard  was divided between his two Sons  Arcadius  and  Honorius  From thence passing to such as could gain most credit with the Soldiers the Western Empire being brought almost to nothing was restor'd by  Charles  the Great of  France  and continuing for some time in his descendents came to the  Germans  who having created several Emperors of the Houses of  Suevia Saxony Bavaria  and others as they pleas'd about three hundred years past chose  Rodolphus  of  Austria  and tho since that time they have not had any Emperor who was not of that Family yet such as were chosen had nothing to recommend them but the merits of their Ancestors their own personal Vertues or such political considerations as might arise from the power of their hereditary Countrys which being join'd with those of the Empire might enable 'em to make the better defence against the  Turks  But in this Line also they have had little regard to inheritance according to blood for the elder branch of the Family is that which reigns in  Spain  and the Empire continues in the descendents of  Ferdinand  younger Brother to  Charles  the fifth tho so unfix'd even to this time that the present Emperor  Leopold  was in great danger of being rejected  If it be said that these are elective Kingdoms and our Author speaks of such as are hereditary I answer that if what he says be true there  can be no Elective Kingdom and every Nation has a natural Lord to whom obedience is due But if some are Elective all might have bin so if they had pleas'd unless it can be prov'd that God created some under a necessity of subjection and left to others the enjoyment of their liberty If this be so the Nations born under that necessity may be said to have a natural Lord who has all the power in himself before he is crown'd or any part confer'd on him by the consent of the people but it cannot extend to others And he who pretends a right over any Nation upon that account stands oblig'd to shew when and how that Nation came to be discriminated by God from others and depriv'd of that liberty which he in goodness had granted to the rest of mankind I confess I think there is no such Right and need no better proof than the various ways of disposing Inheritances in several Countrys which not being naturally or universally better or worse one than another cannot spring from any other root than the consent of the several Nations where they are in force and their opinions that such methods were best for them But if God has made a discrimination of people he that would thereupon ground a Title to the dominion of any one must prove that Nation to be under the curse of Slavery which for any thing I know was only denounc'd against  Cham  and 'tis as hard to determin whether the sense of it be temporal spiritual or both as to tell precisely what Nations by being descended from him fall under the Penaltys threaten'd  If these therefore be either intirely false or impossible to be prov'd true there is no discrimination or not known to us and every People has a right of disposing of their Government as well as the  Polanders Danes Swedes Germans  and such as are or were under the  Roman  Empire And if any Nation has a natural Lord before he be admitted by their consent it must be by a peculiar act of their own as the Crown of  France  by an act of that Nation which they call the Salique Law is made hereditary to Males in a direct Line or the nearest to the direct and others in other places are otherwise dispos'd  I might rest here with full assurance that no Disciple of  Filmer  can prove this of any people in the world nor give so much as the shadow of a reason to persuade us there is any such thing in any Nation or at least in those where we are concern'd and presume little regard will be had to what he has said since he cannot prove of any that which he so boldly affirms of all But because good men ought to have no other object than Truth which in matters of this importance can never be made too evident I will venture to go farther and assert That as the various ways by which several Nations dispose of the succession to their respective Crowns shew they were subject to no other Law than their own which they might have made different by the same right they made it to be what it is even those who have the greatest veneration for the reigning Familys and the highest regard for proximity of blood have always prefer'd the safety of the Commonwealth before the concernments of any Person or Family and have laid aside the nearest in blood not only when they were found to be notoriously vicious and wicked but when they have thought it more convenient to take others And to prove this I intend to make use of no other Examples than those I find in the Historys of  Spain France  and  England  Whilst the  Goths  govern'd  Spain  not above four persons in the space of three hundred years were the immediate successors of their Fathers but the Brother Cousin German or some other man of the Familys of the  Balthei  or  Amalthei  was prefer'd before the Children of the deceas'd King and if it be said this was according to the Law of that Kingdom I answer that it was therefore in the power of that Nation to make Laws for themselves and consequently others have the same right One of their Kings call'd  Wamba  was depos'd and made a Monk after he had  Saavedra Coron Goth  reign'd well many years but falling into a swound and his friends thinking him past recovery cut off his hair and put a Monk's Frock upon him that according to the superstition of those times he might die in it and the cutting off the hair being a most disgraceful thing amongst  Mar Hist l  the  Goths  they would not restore him to his Authority  Suintila  another of their Kings being depriv'd of the Crown for his ill Government his Children and Brothers were excluded and  Sisinandus  crown'd in his  Saavedra Coron Goth  room  This Kingdom being not long after overthrown by the  Moors  a new one arose from its ashes in the person of  Don Pelayo  first King of the  Asturia  's which increasing by degrees at last came to comprehend all  Spain  and so continues to this day But not troubling my self with all the deviations from the common rule in the collateral Lines of  Navarr Arragon  and  Portugal  I find that by fifteen several Instances in that one series of Kings in the  Asturia  's and  Leon  who afterwards came to be Kings of  Castille  it is fully prov'd that what respect soever they shew'd to the next in blood who by the Law were to succeed they prefer'd some other person as often as the supreme Law of  taking care that the Nation might receive no detriment  persuaded them to it  Don Pelayo  enjoy'd for his life the Kingdom confer'd upon him by the  Spaniards  who with him retir'd into the Mountains to defend themselves against the  Moors  and was succeeded by his Son  Favila  But tho  Favila  left many Sons when he dy'd  Alphonso  sirnam'd the Chast was advanc'd to the Crown and they all laid aside  Fruela  Son to  Alphonso  the Catholick was for his cruelty depos'd put to death and his Sons excluded  Aurelio  his Cousin German succeeded him and at his death  Silo  who  Mariana l  marry'd his Wife's Sister was prefer'd before the Males of the Blood Royal  Alphonso  sirnam'd  El Casto  was first violently dispossest of the Crown by a Bastard of the Royal Family but he being dead the Nobility and People thinking  Alphonso  more fit to be a Monk than a King gave the Crown to  Bermudo  call'd  El Diacono  but  Bermudo  after several years resigning the Kingdom they conceiv'd a better opinion of  Alphonso  and made him King  Alphonso  dying without issue  Don Ramiro  Son to  Bermudo  was prefer'd before the Nephews of  Alphonso Don Ordonno  fourth from  Ramiro  le  t four legitimate Sons but they being young the Estates laid them aside and made his Brother  Fruela  King  Fruela  had many Children but the same Estates gave the Crown to  Alphonso  the Fourth who was his Nephew  Alphonso  turning Monk recommended his Son  Ordonno  to the Estates of the Kingdom but they refus'd him and made his Brother  Ramiro  King  Ordonno  third Son to  Ramiro  dying left a Son call'd  Bermudo  but the Estates took his Brother  Sancho  and advanc'd him to the throne  Henry  the First being accidentally kill'd in his youth left only two Sisters  Blanche  marry'd to  Lewis  Son to  Philip August  King of  France  and  Berenguela  marry'd to  Alphonso  King of  Leon  The Estates made  Ferdinand  Son of  Berenguela  the youngest Sister  Marian l  c  King excluding  Blanche  with her Husband and Children for being Strangers and  Berenguela  her self because they thought not fit that her Husband should have any part in the Government  Alphonso El Savio  seems to have bin a very good Prince but applying himself more to the study of Astrology than to affairs of Government his eldest Son  Ferdinand de la Cerda  dying and leaving his Sons  Alphonso  and  Ferdinand  very young the Nobility Clergy and People depos'd him excluded his Granchildren and gave the Crown to  Don Sancho  his younger Son sirnam'd  El Bravo  thinking him more fit to command them against the  Moors  than an old Astrologer or a Child  Alphonso  and  Sancho  being dead  Alphonso el Desheredado  laid claim to the Crown but it was given to  Ferdinand  the Fourth and  Alphonso  with his descendents the Dukes  de Medina Celi  remain excluded to this day  Peter  sirnam'd the Cruel was twice driven out of the Kingdom and at last kill'd by  Bertrand de Guesclin  Constable of  France  or  Henry  Count of  Trastamara  his BastardBrother who was made King without any regard to the Daughters of  Peter  or  Marian l  to the House of  La Cerda Henry  the Fourth left a Daughter call'd  Joan  whom he declar'd his Heir but the Estates gave the Kingdom to  Isabel  his Sister and crown'd her with  Ferdinand  of  Arragon  her Husband  Joan  Daughter to this  Ferdinand  and  Isabel  falling mad the Estates committed the care of the Governnent to her Father  Ferdinand  and after his death to her Son  But the  French  have taught us that when a King dies his next Heir is really King before he take his Oath or be crown'd From them we learn that  Le mort saisit le vif  And yet I know no History that proves more plainly than theirs that there neither is nor can be in any man a right to the Government of a People which dos not receive its being manner and measure from the Law of the Country which I hope to justify by four Reasons  When a King of  Pharamond  's Race dy'd the Kingdom was divided into as many parcels as he had Sons which could not have bin if one certain Heir had bin assign'd by nature for he ought to have had the whole and if the Kingdom might be divided they who inhabited the several parcels could not know to whom they ow'd obedience till the division was made unless he who was to be King of  Paris Metz Soissons  or  Orleans  had worn the Name of his Kingdom upon his forehead But in truth if there might be a division the Doctrin is false and there was no Lord of the whole This wound will not be heal'd by saying The Father appointed the division and that by the Law of nature every man may dispose of his own as he thinks fit for we shall soon prove that the Kingdom of  France  neither was nor is disposable as a Patrimony or Chattel Besides if that Act of Kings had bin then grounded upon the Law of nature they might do the like at this day But the Law by which such Divisions were made having bin abrogated by the Assembly  Hist de Fr en la Vie de Hugues Capet  of Estates in the time of  Hugh Capet  and never practis'd since it follows that they were grounded upon a temporary Law and not upon the Law of Nature which is eternal If this were not so the pretended certainty could not be for no man could know to whom the last King had bequeath'd the whole Kingdom or parcels of it till the Will were open'd and that must be done before such Witnesses as may deserve credit in a matter of this importance and are able to judg whether the Bequest be rightly made for otherwise no man could know whether the Kingdom was to have one Lord or many nor who he or they were to be which intermission must necessarily subvert their Polity and this Doctrin But the truth is the most Monarchical men among them are so far from acknowledging any such right to be in the King of alienating bequeathing  or dividing the Kingdom that they do not allow him the right of making a Will and that of the last King  Lewis  the  th  touching the Regency during the minority of his Son was of no effect  Mem du Duc de la Rochefocault  This matter was made more clear under the second race If a Lord had bin assign'd to them by nature he must have bin of the Royal Family But  Pepin  had no other Title to the Crown except the merits of his Father and his own approv'd by the Nobility and People who made him King He had three sons the eldest was made King of  Italy  and dying before him left a Son call'd  Bernard  Heir of that Kingdom  Paul Aemil Hist Franc▪  The Estates of  France  divided what remain'd between  Charles  the Great and  Carloman  The last of these dying in a few years left many Sons but the Nobility made  Charles  King of all  France  and he dispossest  Bernard  of the Kingdom of  Italy  inherited from his Father so that he also was not King of the whole before the expulsion of  Bernard  the Son of his elder Brother nor of  Aquitain  which by inheritance should have belong'd to the Children of his younger Brother any otherwise than by the will of the Estates  Lewis  the  Debonair  succeeded upon the same title was depos'd and put into a Monastery by his three Sons  Lothair Pepin  and  Lewis  whom he had by his first Wife But tho these left many Sons the Kingdom came to  Charles  the Bald The Nobility and People disliking the eldest Son of  Charles  gave the Kingdom to  Lewis le Begue  who had a legitimate Son called  Charles le Simple  but his two Bastards  Lewis  and  Carloman  were made Kings  Carloman  had a Son call'd  Lewis le faineant  he was made King but afterwards depos'd for his vicious Life  Charles le Gross  succeeded him but for his ill Government was also depos'd and  Odo  who was a stranger to the Royal Blood was made King The same Nobility that had made five Kings since  Lewis le Begue  now made  Charles le Simple  King who according to his name was entrap'd at  Peronne  by  Ralph  Duke of  Burgundy  and forc'd to resign his Crown leaving only a Son call'd  Lewis  who fled into  England Ralph  being dead they took  Lewis  sirnam'd  Outremer  and plac'd him in the Throne he had two Sons  Lothair  and  Charles Lothair  succeeded him and dy'd without Issue  Charles  had as fair a title as could be by Birth and the Estates confest it but their Embassadors told him that he having by an unworthy Life render'd himself unworthy of the Crown they whose principal care was to have a good Prince at the head of them had chosen  Hugh Capet  and the Crown continues in his race to this day tho not altogether without interruption  Robert  Son to  Hugh Capet  succeeded him He left two Sons  Robert  and  Henry  but  Henry  the younger Son appearing to the Estates of the Kingdom to be more fit to reign than his elder Brother they made him King  Robert  and his descendents continuing Dukes of  Burgundy  only for about ten Generations at which time his Issue Male failing that Dutchy return'd to the Crown during the Life of King  John  who gave it to his second Son  Philip  for an  Apannage  still depending upon the Crown The same Province of  Burgundy  was by the Treaty of  Madrid  granted to the Emperor  Charles  the sisth by  Francis  the first but the People refus'd to be alienated and the Estates of the Kingdom approv'd their refusal By the same Authority  Charles  the  th  was remov'd from the Government when he appear'd to be mad and other examples of a like nature may be alledg'd From which we may safely conclude that if the death of one King dos really invest the next Heir with the Right and Power or that he who is so invested be subject to no Law but his own Will all matters relating  to that Kingdom must have bin horribly confus'd during the reigns of twenty two Kings of  Pharamond  's race they can have had no rightful King from the death of  Chilperic  to King  John  and the Succession since that time is very liable to be question'd if not utterly overthrown by the house of  Austria  who by the Counts of  Hapsburg  derive their Descent from  Pharamond  and by the house of  Lorrain  claiming from  Charles  who was excluded by  Capet  All which is most absurd and they who pretend it bring as much confusion into their own Laws and upon the Polity of their own Nation as shame and guilt upon the memory of their Ancestors who by the most extreme injustice have rejected their natural Lord or dispossest those who had bin in the most solemn manner plac'd in the Government and to whom they had generally sworn Allegiance  If the next Heir be actually King seiz'd of the power by the death of his Predecessor so that there is no intermission then all the Solemnitys and religious Ceremonys us'd at the Coronations of their Kings with the Oaths given and taken are the most profane abuses of sacred things in contempt of God and Man that can be imagin'd most especially if the Act be as our Author calls it voluntary and the King receiving nothing by it be bound to keep it no longer than he pleases The Prince who is to be sworn might spare the pains of watching all night in the Church fasting praying confessing communicating and swearing  that he will to the utmost of his power defend the Clergy maintain the union of the Church obviate all excess rapine extortion and iniquity take care that in all judgments Justice may be observ'd with Equity and Mercy c or of invoking the assistance of the Holy Ghost for the better performance of his Oath  and without ceremony tell the Nobility and People that he would do what he thought fit 'Twere to as little purpose for the Archbishop of  Rheims  to take the trouble of saying Mass delivering to him the Crown Scepter and other ensigns of Royalty explaining what is signify'd by them anointing him with the Oil which they say was deliver'd by an Angel to St  Remigius  blessing him and praying to God to bless him if he rightly perform'd his Oath to God and the People and denouncing the contrary in case of failure on his part if these things confer'd nothing upon him but what he had before and were of no obligation to him Such ludifications of the most sacred things are too odious and impious to be imputed to Nations that have any vertue or profess Christianity This cannot fall upon the  French  and  Spaniards  who had certainly a great zeal to Religion whatever it was and were so eminent sor moral Vertues as to be a reproach to us who live in an Age of more Knowledg But their meaning is so well declar'd by their most solemn Acts that none but those who are wilfully ignorant can mistake One of the Councils held at  Toledo  declar'd by the Clergy Nobility and  T  l  t  others assisting  That no man should be plac'd in the Royal Seat till he had sworn to preserve the Church  c Another held in the same place signify'd  T  l  t  to  Sisinandus  who was then newly crown'd  That if he or any of his Successors should contrary to their Oaths and the Laws of their Country proudly and cruelly presume to exercise Domination over them he should be excommunicated and separated from Christ and them to eternal judgment  The  French  Laws and their best Writers asserting the same things are confirm'd by perpetual practice  Henry  of  Navarre  tho certainly according to their Rules and in their esteem a most accomplish'd Prince    was by two General Assemblys of the Estates held at  Blois  depriv'd of the Succession for being a Protestant and notwithstanding the greatness  of his Reputation Valor Victorys and Affability could never be admitted till he had made himself capable of the ceremonys of his Coronation by conforming to the Religion which by the Oath he was to defend Nay this present King tho haughty enough by nature and elevated by many successes has acknowledg'd as he says with joy that he can do nothing contrary to Law and calls it a happy impotence in pursuance of which he has annul'd many Acts of his Father and Grandfather alienating the demeasnes of the Crown as things contrary to Law and not within their power  These things being confirm'd by all the good Authors of that Nation  Filmer  finds only the worst to be fit for his turn and neither minding Law nor History takes his Maxims from a vile flattering discourse of  Bellay  calculated for the personal Interest of  Henry  the fourth then King of  Navarr  in which he says  That the Heir apparent tho furious mad  Apol Cathol  a fool vicious and in all respects abominably wicked must be admitted to the Crown  But  Bellay  was so far from attaining the ends design'd by his Book that by such Doctrins which fill'd all men with horror he brought great prejudice to his Master and procur'd little favor from  Henry  who desir'd rather to recommend himself to his People as the best man they could set up than to impose a necessity upon 'em of taking him if he had bin the worst But our Author not contented with what this Sycophant says in relation to such Princes as are plac'd in the Government by a Law establishing the Succession by inheritance with an impudence peculiar to himself asserts the same right to be in any man who by any means gets into Power and imposes the same necessity of obedience upon the Subject where there is no Law as  Bellay  dos by virtue of one that is establish'd  In the last place As  Bellay  acknowledges that the right belongs to Princes only where 'tis establish'd by Law I deny that there is was or ever can be any such No People is known to have bin so mad or wicked as by their own consent for their own good and for the obtaining of Justice to give the power to Beasts under whom it could never be obtain'd or if we could believe that any had bin guilty of an act so full of folly turpitude and wickedness it could not have the force of a Law and could never be put in execution for tho the rules by which the proximity should be judg'd be never so precise it will still be doubted whose case sutes best with them Tho the Law in some places gives private Inheritances to the next Heir and in others makes allotments according to several proportions no one knows to whom or how far the benefit shall accrue to any man till it be adjudg'd by a Power to which the partys must submit Contests will in the like manner arise concerning successions to Crowns how exactly soever they be dispos'd by Law For tho every one will say that the next ought to succeed yet no man knows who is the next which is too much verify'd by the bloody decisions of such disputes in many parts of the world and he that says the next in blood is actually King makes all questions thereupon arising impossible to be otherwise determin'd than by the Sword the pretender to the right being plac'd above the judgment of man and the Subjects for any thing I know oblig'd to believe serve and obey him if he says he has it For otherwise if either every man in particular or all together have a right of judging his title it can be of no value till it be adjudg'd  I confess that the Law of  France  by the utter exclusion of Females and their descendents dos obviate many dangerous and inextricable difficultys but others remain which are sufficient to subvert all the Polity of that Kingdom if there be not a power of judging them and there can be none if it be true that  Le mort saisit le vif  Not to trouble my self with feign'd cases that of Legitimation alone will suffice 'Tis not enough to say that the Children born under marriage are to be reputed legitimate for not only several Children born of  Joan  Daughter to the King of  Portugal  Wife to  Henry  the Fourth of  Castille  during the time of their Marriage were utterly rejected as begotten in Adultery but also her Daughter  Joan  whom the King during his life and at the hour of his death acknowledg'd to have bin begotten by him and the only Title that  Isabel  who was marry'd to  Ferdinand  of  Arragon  had to the Crown of  Spain  was deriv'd from their rejection It would be tedious and might give offence to many great Persons if I should relate all the dubious cases that have bin or still remain in the World touching matters of this nature but the Lawyers of all Nations will testify that hardly any one point comes before them which affords a greater number of difficult Cases than that of Marriages and the Legitimation of Children upon them and Nations must be involv'd in the most inextricable difficultys if there be not a power somewhere to decide them which cannot be if there be no intermission and that the next in blood that is he who says he is the next be immediately invested with the right and power But surely no people has bin so careless of their most important Concernments to leave them in such uncertainty and simply to depend upon the humor of a man or the faith of women who besides their other Frailtys have bin often accus'd of supposititious Births and mens passions are known to be so violent in relation to Women they love or hate that none can safely be trusted with those Judgments The vertue of the best would be expos'd to a temptation that flesh and blood can hardly resist and such as are less perfect would follow no other rule than the blind impulse of the passion that for the present reigns in them There must therefore be a judg of such disputes as may in these cases arise in every Kingdom and tho 'tis not my business to determin who is that judg in all places yet I may justly say that in  England  it is the Parliament If no inferior Authority could debar  Ignotus  Son to the Lady  Rosse  born under the Protection from the inheritance of a private Family none can certainly assume a power of disposing of the Crown upon any occasion No Authority but that of the Parliament could legitimate the Children of  Catherine Swinford  with a proviso not to extend to the inheritance of the Crown Others might say if they were lawfully begotten they ought to inherit every thing and nothing if they were not But the Parliament knew how to limit a particular favor and prevent it from extending to a publick mischief  Henry  the Eighth took an expeditious way of obviating part of the Controversys that might arise from the multitude of his Wives by cutting off the heads of some as soon as he was weary of them or had a mind to take another but having bin hinder'd from dealing in the same manner with  Catherine  by the greatness of her birth and kindred he left such as the Parliament only could resolve And no less power would ever have thought of making  Mary  and  Elizabeth  capable of the succession when according to ordinary rules one of 'em must have bin a Bastard and it had bin absurd to say that both of 'em were immediately upon the death of their Predecessors  possest of the Crown if an Act of Parliament had not confer'd the right upon them which they could not have by birth But the Kings and Princes of  England  have not bin of a temper different from those of other Nations and many Examples may be brought of the like occasions of dispute happening every where and the like will probably be for ever which must necessarily introduce the most mischievous confusions and expose the Titles which as is pretended are to be esteem'd most sacred to be overthrown by violence and fraud if there be not in all places a Power of deciding the Controversys that arise from the uncertainty of Titles according to the respective Laws of every Nation upon which they are grounded No man can be thought to have a just Title till it be so adjudg'd by that power This judgment is the first step to the Throne The Oath taken by the King obliges him to observe the Laws of his Country and that concerning the Succession being one of the principal he is oblig'd to keep that part as well as any other  SECT XIX The greatest Enemy of a just Magistrate is he who endeavours to invalidate the Contract between him and the People or to corrupt their Manners  'TIS not only from Religion but from the Law of Nature that we learn the necessity of standing to the agreements we make and he who departs from the principle written in the hearts of men  Pactis standum  seems to degenerate into a beast Such as had vertue tho without true religion could tell us as a brave and excellent  Grecian  did that it was not necessary for him to live but it was necessary to preserve his Heart from deceit and his Tongue from falshood The  Roman  Satyrist carrys the same Notion to a great height and affirms that  Phalaris licet imperet ut sis  F  lsus admoto dictet perjuria Tauro  Summum crede nesas animam praferre pudori  Juvena  ▪  tho the worst of Tyrants should command a man to be false and perjur'd and back his injunction with the utmost of Torments he ought to prefer his integrity before his life  And tho  Filmer  may be excus'd if he often mistake in matters of Theology yet his Inclinations to  Rome  which he prefers before  Geneva  might have led him to the Principles in which the honest  Romans  liv'd if he had not observ'd that such Principles as make men honest and generous do also make them lovers of Liberty and constant in the defence of their Country which savouring too much of a Republican Spirit he prefers the morals of that City since they are become more refin'd by the pious and charitable Jesuits before those that were remarkable in them as long as they retain'd any shadow of their antient Integrity which admitted of no equivocations and detested prevarications by that means preserving innocence in the hearts of private men for their inward contentment and in civil Societys for the publick good which if once extinguish'd Mankind must necessarily fall into the condition  Hobbes  rightly calls  Bellum omnium contra omnes  wherein no man can promise to  himself any other Wise Children or Goods than he can procure by his own Sword  Some may perhaps think that the endeavours of our Author to introduce such accursed Principles as tend to the ruin of Mankind proceed from his ignorance But tho he appears to have had a great measure of that quality I fear the evil proceeds from a deeper root and that he attempts to promote the interests of ill Magistrats who make it their business to destroy all good principles in the People with as much industry as the good endeavour to preserve them where they are and teach them where they are wanting Reason and Experience instruct us that every man acts according to the end he proposes to himself The good Magistrate seeks the good of the People committed to his care that he may perform the end of his Institution and knowing that chiefly to consist in Justice and Vertue he endeavours to plant and propagate them and by doing this he procures his own good as well as that of the Publick He knows there is no Safety where there is no Strength no Strength without Union no Union without Justice no Justice where Faith and Truth in accomplishing publick and private Contracts is wanting This he perpetually inculcates and thinks it a great part of his duty by precept and example to educate the Youth in a love of Vertue and Truth that they may be season'd with them and fill'd with an abhorrence of Vice and Falshood before they attain that Age which is expos'd to the most violent temptations and in which they may by their crimes bring the greatest mischiefs upon the publick He would do all this tho it were to his own prejudice But as good Actions always carry a reward with them these contribute in a high measure to his advantage By preferring the interest of the People before his own he gains their affection and all that is in their power comes with it whilst he unites them to one another he unites all to himself In leading them to vertue he increases their strength and by that means provides for his own safety glory and power  On the other side such as seek different ends must take different ways When a Magistrate fancys he is not made for the People but the People for him that he dos not govern for them but for himself and that the People live only to increase his glory or to furnish matter for his pleasures he dos not inquire what he may do for them but what he may draw from them By this means he sets up an interest of profit pleasure or pomp in himself repugnant to the good of the publick for which he is made to be what he is These contrary ends certainly divide the Nation into partys and whilst every one endeavours to advance that to which he is addicted occasions of hatred for injurys every day done or thought to be done and receiv'd must necessarily arise This creates a most fierce and irreconcilable enmity because the occasions are frequent important and universal and the causes thought to be most just The People think it the greatest of all crimes to convert that power to their hurt which was instituted for their good and that the injustice is aggravated by perjury and ingratitude which comprehend all manner of ill and the Magistrate gives the name of Sedition or Rebellion to whatsoever they do for the preservation of themselves and their own Rights When mens Spirits are thus prepar'd a small matter sets them on fire but if no accident happen to blow them into a flame the course of Justice is certainly interrupted the publick affairs are neglected and when any occasion whether foreign or domestick arises in which the Magistrate  stands in need of the Peoples assistance they whose affections are alienated not only shew an unwillingness to serve him with their Persons and Estates but fear that by delivering him from his distress they strengthen their enemy and enable him to oppress them and he fancying his will to be unjustly oppos'd or his due more unjustly deny'd is fill'd with a dislike of what he sees and a fear of worse for the future Whilst he endeavours to ease himself of the one and to provide against the other he usually increases the evils of both and jealousys are on both sides multiply'd Every man knows that the Governed are in a great measure under the power of the Governor but as no man or number of men is willingly subject to those who seek their ruin such as fall into so great a misfortune continue no longer under it than force fear or necessity may be able to oblige them But as such a necessity can hardly lie longer upon a great People than till the evil be fully discover'd and comprehended and their Vertue Strength and Power be united to expel it the ill Magistrate looks upon all things that may conduce to that end as so many preparatives to his ruin and by the help of those who are of his party will endeavour to prevent that Union and diminish that Strength Vertue Power and Courage which he knows to be bent against him And as truth faithful dealing due performance of Contracts and integrity of Manners are bonds of Union and helps to good he will always by tricks artifices cavils and all means possible endeavour to establish falshood and dishonesty whilst other Emissarys and instruments of Iniquity by corrupting the Youth and seducing such as can be brought to leudness and debauchery bring the People to such a pass that they may neither care nor dare to vindicate their Rights and that those who would do it may so far suspect each other as not to confer upon much less to join in any action tending to the publick Deliverance  This distinguishes the good from the bad Magistrate the faithful from the unfaithful and those who adhere to either living in the same principle must walk in the same ways They who uphold the rightful power of a just Magistracy encourage Vertue and Justice and teach men what they ought to do suffer or expect from others they fix them upon principles of Honesty and generally advance every thing that tends to the increase of the valor strength greatness and happiness of the Nation creating a good Union among them and bringing every man to an exact understanding of his own and the publick Rights On the other side he that would introduce an ill Magistrate make one evil who was good or preserve him in the exercise of injustice when he is corrupted must always open the way for him by vitiating the People corrupting their Manners destroying the validity of Oaths and Contracts teaching such evasions equivocations and frauds as are inconsistent with the thoughts that become men of vertue and courage and overthrowing the confidence they ought to have in each other make it impossible for them to unite among themselves The like Arts must be us'd with the Magistrate He cannot be for their turn till he is persuaded to believe he has no dependence upon and ows no duty to the People that he is of himself and not by their Institution that no man ought to inquire into nor be judg of his actions that all obedience is due to him whether he be good or bad wise or foolish a father or an enemy to his Country This being calculated for his personal interest he must pursue the same designs or his Kingdom is divided within it self and cannot subsist By this means those who flatter his humor come to be accounted his  Friends and the only men that are thought worthy of great Trusts whilst such as are of another mind are expos'd to all persecution These are always such as excel in Vertue Wisdom and greatness of Spirit they have Eyes and they will always see the way they go and leaving fools to be guided by implicit Faith will distinguish between good and evil and chuse that which is best they will judg of men by their actions and by them discovering whose Servant every man is know whether he is to be obey'd or not Those who are ignorant of all good careless or enemys to it take a more compendious way their slavish vitious and base natures inclining them to seek only private and present advantages they easily slide into a blind dependence upon one who has Wealth and Power and desiring only to know his will care not what injustice they do if they may be rewarded They worship what they find in the Temple tho it be the vilest of Idols and always like that best which is worst because it agrees with their inclinations and principles When a party comes to be erected on such a foundation debauchery leudness and dishonesty are the true badges of it Such as wear them are cherish'd but the principal marks of favor are reserv'd for those who are the most industrious in mischief either by seducing the People with the allurements of sensual Pleasures or corrupting their Understandings by false and slavish Doctrins By this means a man who calls himself a Philosopher or a Divine is often more useful than a great number of Tapsters Cooks Buffoons Players Fidlers Whores or Bauds These are the Devil's Ministers of a lower Order they seduce single Persons and such as fall into their snares are for the most part men of the simpler sort but the principal supporters of his Kingdom are they who by false Doctrins poison the springs of Religion and Vertue and by preaching or writing if their falshood and wickedness were not detected would extinguish all principles of common honesty and bring whole Nations to be best satisfy'd with themselves when their actions are most abominable And as the means must always be sutable to the end propos'd the Governments that are to be establish'd or supported by such ways must needs be the worst of all and comprehend all manner of evil  SECT XX Unjust Commands are not to be obey'd and no man is oblig'd to suffer for not obeying such as are against Law  IN the next place our Author gravely proposes a question  Whether it be a sin to disobey the King if he command any thing contrary to Law  and as gravely determins  that not only in human Laws but even in Divine a thing may be commanded contrary to Law and yet obedience to such a Command is necessary The sanctifying of the Sabbath is a divine Law yet if a Master command his Servant not to go to Church upon a Sabbathday the best Divines teach us the Servant must obey c It is not sit to ty the Master to acquaint the Servant with his secret Counsel  Tho he frequently contradicts in one line what he says in another this whole Clause is uniform and sutable to the main design of his Book He sets up the authority  of Man in opposition to the command of God gives it the preference and says the best Divines instruct us so to do St  Paul  then must have bin one of the worst for he knew that the Powers under which he liv'd had under the severest penaltys forbidden the publication of the Gospel and yet he says  Wo to me if I preach it not  St  Peter  was no better than he for he tells us  That it is better to obey God than Man  and they could not speak otherwise unless they had forgotten the words of their Master who told them  They should not fear them that could only kill the Body but him who could kill and cast into Hell  And if I must not fear him that can only kill the Body not only the reason but all excuse for obeying him is taken away  Chap ▪  To prove what he says he cites a pertinent Example from St  Luke  and very logically concludes that because Christ approv'd the hypocrisy of the  Pharisees  who generally adher'd to the external and circumstantial part of the Law neglecting the essential and taking upon themselves to be the interpreters of that which they did not understand the Law of God is not to be obey'd and as strongly proves that because Christ shew'd them that the same Law which by their own confession permitted them to pull an Ass out of a pit on the Sabbathday could not but give a liberty of healing the sick therefore the commands of Kings are to be obey'd tho they should be contrary to human and divine Laws But if perverseness had not blinded him he might have seen that this very Text is wholly against his purpose for the Magistratical Power was on the side of the  Pharisees  otherwise they would not have sought an occasion to ensnare him and that power having perverted the Law of God by false glosses and a superinduction of human Traditions prohibited the most necessary acts of Charity to be done on the Sabbathday which Christ reprov'd and restor'd the sick man to his health in their sight  But I could wish our Author had told us the names of those Divines who he says are the best and who pretend to teach us these fine things I know some who are thought good that are of a contrary opinion and say that God having requir'd that Day to be set apart for his Service and Worship man cannot dispense with the Obligation unless he can abrogate the Law of God Perhaps for want of other Arguments to prove the contrary I may be told that this savours too much of Puritanism and Calvinism But I shall take the reproach till some better Patrons than  Laud  and his creatures may be found for the other opinion By the advice and instigation of these men from about the year to sports and revelings which ended for the most part in drunkenness and leudness were not only permitted on that day but enjoin'd And tho this did advance human Authority in derogation to the Divine to a degree that may please such as are of our Author's mind yet others resolving rather to obey the Laws of God than the Commands of Men could not be brought to pass the Lord's day in that manner Since that time no man except  Filmer  and  Heylin  have bin so wicked to conceive or so impudent to assert such brutal absurditys But leaving the farther consideration of the original of this abuse I desire to know whether the Authority given to Masters to command things contrary to the Law of God be peculiar in relation to the Sabbath or to a few other points or ought generally to extend to all God's Laws and whether he who may command his Servant to act contrary to the Law of God have not a right in himself of doing the same If peculiar some Authority or Precept  must be produc'd by which it may appear that God has slighted his Ordinance concerning that Day and suffer'd it to be contemn'd whilst he exacts obedience to all others If we have a liberty left to us of slighting others also more or less in number we ought to know how many what they are and how it comes to pass that some are of obligation and others not If the Empire of the world is not only divided between God and  Cesar  but every man also who can give five pounds a year to a Servant has so great a part in it that in some cases his commands are to be obey'd preferably to those of God it were fit to know the limits of each Kingdom lest we happen preposterously to obey man when we ought to obey God or God when we are to follow the commands of men If it be general the Law of God is of no effect and we may safely put an end to all thoughts and discourses of Religion the word of God is nothing to us we are not to inquire what he has commanded but what pleases our Master how insolent foolish vile or wicked soever he may be The Apostles and Prophets who dy'd for preferring the commands of God before those of men fell like fools and perish'd in their sins But if every particular man that has a servant can exempt him from the commands of God he may also exempt himself and the Laws of God are at once abrogated throout the world  'Tis a folly to say there is a passive as well as an active Obedience and that he who will not do what his Master commands ought to suffer the punishment he inflicts for if the Master has a right of commanding there is a duty incumbent on the servant of obeying He that suffers for not doing that which he ought to do draws upon himself both the guilt and the punishment But no one can be oblig'd to suffer for that which he ought not to do because he who pretends to command has not so far an Authority However our question is whether the Servant should forbear to do that which God commands rather than whether the Master should put away or beat him if he do not for if the Servant ought to obey his Master rather than God as our Author says the best Divines assert he sins in disobeying and that guilt cannot be expiated by his suffering If it be thought I carry this point to an undue extremity the limits ought to be demonstrated by which it may appear that I exceed them tho the nature of the case cannot be alter'd for if the Law of God may not be abrogated by the commands of men a Servant cannot be exempted from keeping the Sabbath according to the Ordinance of God at the will of his Master But if a power be given to man at his pleasure to annul the Laws of God the Apostles ought not to have preach'd when they were forbidden by the Powers to which they were subject The tortures and deaths they suffer'd for not obeying that command were in their own wrong and their blood was upon their own heads  His second instance concerning Wars in which he says the Subject is not to examin whether they are just or unjust but must obey is weak and frivolous and very often false whereas consequences can rightly be drawn from such things only as are certainly and universally true Tho God may be merciful to a Soldier who by the wickedness of a Magistrate whom he honestly trusts is made a Minister of injustice 'tis nothing to this case For if our Author say true that the word of a King can justify him in going against the command of God he must do what is commanded tho he think it evil The Christian Soldiers under the Pagan Emperors were oblig'd to destroy their Brethren and the best  men in the world for being so Such as now live under the  Turk  have the same obligation upon them of defending their Master and slaughtering those he reputes his Enemys for adhering to Christianity And the King of  France  may when he pleases arm one part of his Protestant Subjects to the destruction of the other which is a godly doctrin and worthy our Author's invention  But if this be so I know not how the  Israelites  can be said to have sinn'd in following the examples of  Jeroboam Omri Ahab  or other wicked Kings they could not have sinn'd in obeying if it had bin a sin to disobey their commands and God would not have punish'd them so severely if they had not sinn'd 'Tis impertinent to say they were oblig'd to serve their Kings in unjust Wars but not to serve Idols for tho God be jealous of his glory yet he forbids Rapine and Murder as well as Idolatry If there be a Law that forbids the Subject to examin the commands tending to the one it cannot but enjoin obedience to the other The same Authority which justifys Murder takes away the guilt of Idolatry and the Wretches both Judges and Witnesses who put  Naboth  to death could as little alledg ignorance as those that worship'd  Jeroboam  's Calves the same light of Nature by which they should have known that a ridiculous Image was not to be ador'd as God instructing them also that an innocent man ought not under pretence of Law to be murder'd by perjury  SECT XXI It cannot be for the good of the People that the Magistrate have a power above the Law and he is not a Magistrate who has not his power by Law  THAT we may not be displeas'd or think it dangerous and slavish to depend upon the will of a man which perhaps may be irregular or extravagant in one who is subject to no Law our Author very dextrously removes the scruples by telling us    That the Prerogative of the King to be above the Law is only for the good of them that are under the Law and to preserve their Libertys    That there can be no Laws without a supreme Power to command or make them In Aristocracys the Noblemen are above the Law in Democracys the People By the like reason in a Monarchy the King must of necessity be above the Law There can be no Sovereign Majesty in him that is under the Law that which gives the very being to a King is the power to give Laws Without this Power he is but an equivocal King It skills not how he comes by this Power whether by Election Donation Succession or any other means  I am contented in some degree to follow our Author and to acknowledg that the King neither has nor can have any Prerogative which is not for the good of the People and the preservation of their Libertys This therefore is the foundation of Magistratical Power and the only way of discerning whether the Prerogative of making Laws of being above Laws or any other he may pretend be justly due to him or not and if it be doubted who is the fittest judg to determin that question common sense will inform us that if the Magistrate receive his Power by election or donation they who elect or give him that Power best  know whether the good they sought be perform'd or not if by succession they who instituted the Succession if otherwise that is by fraud or violence the point is decided for he has no right at all and none can be created by those means This might be said tho all Princes were of ripe age sober wise just and good for even the best are subject to mistakes and passions and therefore unfit to be judges of their own concernments in which they may by various means be misguided but it would be extreme madness to attribute the same to Children Fools or Madmen who are not able to judg of the least things concerning themselves or others but most especially to those who coming in by usurpation declare their contempt of all human and divine Laws and are enemys to the People they oppress None therefore can be judges of such cases but the People for whom and by whom the Constitutions are made or their Representatives and Delegats to whom they give the power of doing it  But nothing can be more absurd than to say that one man has an absolute power above Law to govern according to his will  for the Peoples good and the preservation of their Liberty  For no Liberty can subsist where there is such a Power and we have no other way of distinguishing between free Nations and such as are not so than that the free are govern'd by their own Laws and Magistrats according to their own mind and that the others either have willingly subjected themselves or are by force brought under the power of one or more men to be rul'd according to his or their pleasure The same distinction holds in relation to particular persons He is a free man who lives as best pleases himself under Laws made by his own consent and the name of slave can belong to no man unless to him who is either born in the house of a Master bought taken subdu'd or willingly gives his ear to be nail'd to the post and subjects himself to the will of another Thus were the  Grecians  said to be free in opposition to the  Medes  and  Persians  as  Artabanus  acknowledg'd in his Discourse to  Themistocles  In the same manner the  Italians Germans  and  Spaniards  were distinguish'd from the Eastern Nations who for the most part were under the power of Tyrants  Rome  was said to have recover'd liberty by the expulsion of the  Tarquins  or as  Tacitus  expresses it  Libertatem Consulatum L Brutus instituit  An l    Lucius Brutus establish'd Liberty and the Consulat together  as if before that time they had never enjoy'd any and  Julius Cesar  is said to have overthrown the liberty of that People But if  Filmer  deserve credit the  Romans  were free under  Tarquin  enslav'd when he was driven way and his Prerogative extinguish'd that was so necessarily requir'd for the defence of their Liberty and were never restor'd to it till  Cesar  assum'd all the Power to himself By the same rule the  Switzers Grisons Venetians Hollanders  and some other Nations are now Slaves and  Tuscany  the Kingdom of  Naples  the Ecclesiastical State with such as live under a more gentle Master on the other side of the Water I mean the  Turk  are free Nations Nay the  Florentins  who complain of Slavery under the House of  Medices  were made free by the power of a  Spanish  Army who set up a Prerogative in that gentle Family which for their good has destroy'd all that could justly be call'd so in that Country and almost wholly dispeopl'd it I who esteem my self free because I depend upon the will of no man and hope to die in the liberty I inherit from my Ancestors am a slave and the  Moors  or  Turks  who  may be beaten and kill'd whenever it pleases their insolent Masters are Freemen But surely the world is not so much mistaken in the signification of words and things The weight of Chains number of Stripes hardness of labor and other effects of a Master's cruelty may make one servitude more miserable than another but he is a slave who serves the best and gentlest man in the world as well as he who serves the worst and he dos serve him if he must obey his commands and depends upon his will For this reason the Poet ingeniously flattering a good Emperor said that Liberty was not more desirable than to serve a gentle Master but still acknowledg'd that it was a service distinct from and contrary to Liberty and it had not bin a handsom complement unless the evil of servitude were so extreme that nothing but the vertue and goodness of the Master could any way compensate or alleviate it Now tho it should be granted that he had spoken more like to a Philosopher than a Poet that we might take his words in the strictest sense and think it possible to find such Conveniences in a subjection to the will of a good and wise Master as may balance the loss of Liberty it would be nothing to the question because that Liberty is thereby acknowledg'd to be destroy'd by the Prerogative which is only instituted to preserve it If it were true that no liberty were to be prefer'd before the service of a good Master it could be of no use to the perishing world which  Filmer  and his Disciples would by such arguments bring into a subjection to children fools mad or vicious men These are not cases feign'd upon a distant imaginary possibility but so frequently found amongst men that there are few examples of the contrary And as 'tis folly to suppose that Princes will always be wise just and good when we know that few have bin able alone to bear the weight of a Government or to resist the temptations to ill that accompany an unlimited power it would be madness to presume they will for the future be free from infirmitys and vices And if they be not the Nations under them will not be in such a condition of servitude to a good Master as the Poet compares to Liberty but in a miserable and shameful subjection to the will of those who know not how to govern themselves or to do good to others Tho  Moses Joshua  and  Samuel  had bin able to bear the weight of an unrestrain'd Power tho  David  and  Solomon  had never abus'd that which they had what effect could this have upon a general Proposition Where are the Familys that always produce such as they were When did God promise to assist all those who should attain to the Sovereign Power as he did them whom he chose for the works he design'd Or what testimony can  Filmer  give us that he has bin present with all those who have hitherto reign'd in the world But if we know that no such thing either is or has bin and can find no promise to assure us nor reason to hope that it ever will be 'tis as foolish to found the hopes of preserving a People upon that which never was or is so likely to fail nay rather which in a short time most certainly will fail as to root up Vines and Figtrees in expectation of gathering grapes and figs from thistles and briars This would be no less than to extinguish the light of common sense to neglect the means that God has given us to provide for our security and to impute to him a disposition of things utterly inconsistent with his Wisdom and Goodness If he has not therefore order'd that thorns and thistles should produce figs and grapes nor that the most important works in the world which are not without the utmost difficulty if at all to be perform'd by the best and wisest of men should be put into  the hands of the weakest most foolish and worst he cannot have ordain'd that such men women or children as happen to be born in reigning Familys or get the power into their hands by fraud treachery or murder as very many have done should have a right of disposing all things according to their will And if men cannot be guilty of so great an absurdity to trust the weakest and worst with a Power which usually subverts the Wisdom and Vertue of the best or to expect such effects of Vertue and Wisdom from those who come by chance as can hardly if at all be hop'd from the most excellent our Author's Proposition can neither be grounded upon the Ordinance of God nor the Institution of men Nay if any such thing had bin establish'd by our first Parents in their simplicity the utter impossibility of attaining what they expected from it must wholly have abrogated the Establishment Or rather it had bin void from the beginning because it was not  Sanctio recta jubens honesta prohibens  ontra  ia  C  er  a just Sanction commanding things good and forbidding the contrary  but a foolish and perverse Sanction setting up the unruly appetites of one person to the subversion of all that is good in the world by making the wisdom of the aged and experienc'd to depend upon the will of Women Children and Fools by sending the strong and the brave to seek protection from the most weak and cowardly and subjecting the most vertuous and best of men to be destroy'd by the most wicked and vicious These being the effects of that unlimited prerogative which our Author says was only instituted for the good and defence of the people it must necessarily fall to the ground unless slavery misery infamy destruction and desolation tend to the preservation of Liberty and are to be prefer'd before strength glory plenty security and happiness The state of the  Roman  Empire after the Usurpation of  Cesar  will set this matter in the clearest light but having done it already in the former parts of this work I content my self to refer to those places And tho the Calamitys they suffer'd were a little allay'd and moderated by the Vertues of  Antoninus  and  M Aurelius  with one or two more yet we have no example of the continuance of them in a family nor of any Nation great or small that has bin under an absolute Power which dos not too plainly manifest that no man or succession of men is to be trusted with it  But says our Author  there can be no Law where there is not a supreme Power  and from thence very strongly concludes it must be in the King for  otherwise there can be no Sovereign Majesty in him and he is but an equivocal King  This might have bin of some force if Governments were establish'd and Laws made only to advance that Sovereign Majesty but nothing at all to the purpose if as he confesses the power which he has be given for the good of the People and for the defence of every private man's Life Liberty Lands and Goods for that which is instituted cannot be abrogated for want of that which was never intended in the institution If the publick Safety be provided Liberty and Propriety secur'd Justice administer'd Vertue encourag'd Vice supprest and the true interest of the Nation advanc'd the ends of Government are accomplish'd and the highest must be contented with such a proportion of Glory and Majesty as is consistent with the publick since the Magistracy is not instituted nor any person plac'd in it for the increase of his Majesty but for the preservation of the whole People and the defence of the Liberty Life and Estate of every private man as our Author himself is forc'd to acknowledg  But what is this Sovereign Majesty so inseparable from Royalty that one cannot subsist without the other  Caligula  plac'd it in a power of  Omnia mihi in omnes licere  Sueton  doing what he pleas'd to all men  Nimrod Nabuchodonosor  and others with an impious and barbarous insolence boasted of the greatness of their power They thought it a glorious Privilege to kill or spare whom they pleas'd But such Kings as by God's permission might have bin set up over his people were to have nothing of this They were not to multiply Gold Silver Wives or Horses they were not to govern by  Deut  their own will but according to the Law from which they might not recede nor raise their Hearts above their brethren Here were Kings without that unlimited Power which makes up the Sovereign Majesty that  Filmer  affirms to be so essential to Kings that without it they are only equivocal which proving nothing but the incurable perversness of his judgment the malice of his heart or malignity of his fate always to oppose reason and truth we are to esteem those to be Kings who are describ'd to be so by the Scriptures and to give another name to those who endeavour to advance their own glory contrary to the precept of God and the interest of mankind  But unless the light of reason had bin extinguish'd in him he might have seen that tho no Law could be made without a supreme Power that Supremacy may be in a Body consisting of many men and several orders of men If it be true which perhaps may be doubted that there have bin in the world simple Monarchys Aristocracys or Democracys legally establish'd 'tis certain that the most part of the Governments of the world and I think all that are or have bin good were mix'd Part of the Power has bin confer'd upon the King or the Magistrate that represented him and part upon the Senat and People as has bin prov'd in relation to the Governments of the  Hebrews Spartans Romans Venetians Germans  and all those who live under that which is usually call'd the Gothic Polity If the single Person participating of this divided Power dislike either the Name he bears or the Authority he has he may renounce it but no reason can be from thence drawn to the prejudice of Nations who give so much as they think consistent with their own good and reserve the rest to themselves or to such other Officers as they please to establish  No man will deny that several Nations have had a right of giving power to Consuls Dictators Archons Suffetes Dukes and other Magistrats in such proportions as seem'd most conducing to their own good and there must be a right in every Nation of allotting to Kings so much as they please as well as to the others unless there be a charm in the word King or in the Letters that compose it But this cannot be for there is no similitude between  King Rex  and  Basileus  they must therefore have a right of regulating the Power of Kings as well as that of Consuls or Dictators and it had not bin more ridiculous in  Fabius Scipio Camillus  or  Cincinnatus  to assert an absolute power in himself under pretence of advancing his Sovereign Majesty against the Law than for any King to do the like But as all Nations give what form they please to their Government they are also judges of the name to be impos'd upon each man who is to have a part in the power and 'tis as lawful for us to call him King who has a limited Authority amongst us as for the  Medes  or  Arabs  to give the same name to one who is more absolute  If this be not admitted we are content to speak improperly but utterly deny that when we give the name we give any thing more than we please and had rather his Majesty should change his name than to renounce our own Rights and Libertys which he is to preserve and which we have receiv'd from God and Nature  But that the folly and wickedness of our Author may not be capable of any farther aggravation he says  That it skills not how he come by the power  Violence therefore or fraud treachery or murder are as good as Election Donation or legal Succession 'Tis in vain to examin the Laws of God or Man or the rights of nature whether Children do inherit the Dignitys and Magistracys of their Fathers as patrimonial Lands and Goods whether regard ought to be had to the fitness of the Person whether all should go to one or be divided amongst them or by what rule we may know who is the right Heir to the Succession and consequently what we are in conscience oblig'd to do Our Author tells us in short it matters not how he that has the power comes by it  It has bin hitherto thought that to kill a King especially a good King was a most abominable action They who did it were thought to be incited by the worst of passions that can enter into the hearts of men and the severest punishments have bin invented to deter them from such attempts or to avenge their death upon those who should accomplish it But if our Author may be credited it must be the most commendable and glorious act that can be perform'd by man for besides the outward advantages that men so earnestly desire he that dos it is presently invested with the Sovereign Majesty and at the same time becomes God's Vicegerent and the father of his Country possest of that Government which in exclusion to all other forms is only favour'd by the Laws of God and Nature The only inconvenience is that all depends upon success and he that is to be the Minister of God and father of his Country if he succeed is the worst of all villains if he fail and at the best may be depriv'd of all by the same means he employ'd to gain it Tho a Prince should have the wisdom and vertues of  Moses  the valor of  Joshua David  and the  Maccabees  with the gentleness and integrity of  Samuel  the most foolish vitious base and detestable man in the world that kills him and seizes the power becomes his Heir and father of the People that he govern'd it  skills  not how he did it whether in open battel or secret treachery in the field or in the bed by poison or by the sword The vilest slave in  Israel  had become the Lord's anointed if he could have kill'd  David  or  Solomon  and found villains to place him in the Throne If this be right the world has to this day liv'd in darkness and the actions which have bin thought to be the most detestable are the most commendable and glorious But not troubling my self at present to decide this question I leave it to Kings to consider how much they are beholden to  Filmer  and his disciples who set such a price upon their heads as would render it hard to preserve their Lives one day if the Doctrins were receiv'd which they endeavour to infuse into the Minds of the People and concluding this point only say that we in  England  know no other King than he who is so by Law nor any power in that King except that which he has by Law And tho the Roman Empire was held by the power of the Sword and  Ʋlpian  a corrupt Lawyer undertakes to fay that  the Prince is not oblig'd by the Laws  yet  Theodosius  consest that it was the glory of a good Emperor to acknowledg himself bound by them  SECT XXII The rigor of the Law is to be temper'd by men of known integrity and judgment and not by the Prince who may be ignorant or vicious  OUR Author's next shift is to place the King above the Law that he may mitigate the rigor of it without which he says  the case of the Subject would be desperately miserable  But this cure would prove worse than the disease Such pious fathers of the People as  Caligula Nero  or  Domitian  were not like to mitigate the rigor nor such as inherit Crowns in their infancy as the present Kings of  Spain France  and  Sweden  so well to understand the meaning of it as to decide extraordinary cases The wisdom of Nations has provided more assured helps and none could have bin so brutish and negligent of the publick Concernments to suffer the Succession to fall to women children c if they had not reserv'd a power in themselves to prefer others before the nearest in blood if reason require and prescrib'd such rules as might preserve the publick from ruin notwithstanding their infirmitys and vices These helps provided by our Laws are principally by grand and petit Jurys who are not only Judges of matters of fact as whether a man be kill'd but whether he be kill'd criminally These Men are upon their Oaths and may be indicted of Perjury if they prevaricate The Judges are present not only to be a check upon them but to explain such points of the Law as may seem difficult And tho these Judges may be said in some sense to be chosen by the King he is not understood to do it otherwise than by the advice of his Council who cannot perform their duty unless they propose such as in their consciences they think most worthy of the Office and most capable of performing the duty rightly nor he accomplish the Oath of his Coronation unless he admit those who upon deliberation seem to be the best The Judges being thus chosen are so far from depending upon the will of the King that they swear faithfully to serve the People as well as the King and to do justice to  Edw  cap  every man according to the Law of the Land notwithstanding any Writs Letters or Commands receiv'd from him and in default thereof they are to forfeit their bodys lands and goods as in cases of Treason These Laws have bin so often and so severely executed that it concerns all Judges well to consider them and the Cases of  Tresilian Empson Dudley  and others shew that neither the King's preceding command nor subsequent pardon could preserve them from the punishment they deserv'd All men knew that what they did was agreeable to the King's pleasure for  Tresilian  advanc'd the Prerogative of  Edward  the  d  and  Empson  brought great Treasures into the Coffers of  Henry  the  th  Nevertheless they were charg'd with Treason for subverting the Laws of the Land and executed as Traitors Tho  England  ought never to forget the happy Reign of Q  Elizabeth  yet it must be acknowledg'd that she as well as others had her failings She was full of love to the People just in her nature sincere in her intentions but could not so perfectly discover the snares that were laid for her or resist the importunity of the Persons she most trusted as not sometimes to be brought to attempt  things against Law She and her Counsellors prest the Judges very hard to obey the Patent under her Great Seal in the case of  Cavendish  Anderson's Rep p  but they answer'd  That both she and they had taken an Oath to keep the Law and if they should obey her commands the Law would not warrant them  c And besides the offence against God their Country and the Commonwealth they alledg'd the example of  Empson  and  Dudley whereby  they said  they were deter'd from obeying her illegal Commands  They who had sworn to keep the Law notwithstanding the King's Writs knew that the Law depended not upon his will and the same Oath that oblig'd them not to regard any command they should receive from him shew'd that they were not to expect indemnity by it and not only that the King had neither the power of making altering mitigating or interpreting the Law but that he was not at all to be heard in general or particular matters otherwise than as he speaks in the common course of Justice by the Courts legally establish'd which say the same thing whether he be young or old ignorant or wise wicked or good And nothing dos better evidence the wisdom and care of our Ancestors in framing the Laws and Government we live under than that the People did not suffer extremitys by the vices or infirmitys of Kings till an Age more full of malice than those in which they liv'd had found tricks to pervert the rule and frustrate their honest intentions It was not safe for the Kings to violate their Oaths by an undue interposition of their Authority but the Ministers who serv'd them in those violations have seldom escap'd punishment This is to be understood when the deviations from Justice are extreme and mischievous for something must always be allow'd to human frailty The best have their defects and none could stand if a too exact scrutiny were made of all their actions  Edward  the third about the twentieth year of his Reign acknowledg'd his own in Parliament and as well for the ease of his Conscience as the satisfaction of his People promoted an Act  Commanding all Judges to do Justice notwithstanding any Writs Letters or Commands from himself and forbidding those that belong'd to the King Queen and Prince to intermeddle in those matters  But if the best and wisest of our Princes in the strength and maturity of their years had their failings and every act proceeding from them that tended to the interruption of Justice was a failing how can it be said that the King in his personal capacity directly or indirectly may enter into the discussion of these matters much less to determin them according to his will  But  says our Author  the Law is no better than a Tyrant general Pardons at the Coronation and in Parliament are but the bounty of the Prerogative  c  There may be hard cases  and citing some perverted pieces from  Aristotle  's Ethicks and Politicks adds  That when something falls out besides the general rule then it is fit that what the Lawmaker has omitted or where he has err'd by speaking generally it should be corrected and supply'd as if the Lawmaker were present that ordain'd it The Governor whether he be one man or more ought to be Lord of these things whereof it was impossible that the Law should speak exactly  These things are in part true but our Author makes use of them as the Devil dos of Scripture to subvert the truth There may be something of rigor in the Law that in some cases may be mitigated and the Law it self in relation to  England  dos so far acknowledg it as to refer much to the consciences of Jurys and those who are appointed to assist them and the most difficult Cases are refer'd to the Parliament as the only judges that are able to determin them  Thus the Statute of  Edw  III enumerating the crimes then declar'd to be Treason leaves to future Parliaments to judg what other facts equivalent to them may deserve the same punishment and 'tis a general rule in the Law which the Judges are sworn to observe that difficult Cases should be reserv'd till the Parliament meet who are only able to decide them and if there be any inconvenience in this 'tis because they do not meet so frequently as the Law requires or by sinister means are interrupted in their sitting But nothing can be more absurd than to say that because the King dos not call Parliaments as the Law and his Oath requires that power should accrue to him which the Law and the consent of the Nation has plac'd in them  There is also such a thing in the Law as a general or particular Pardon and the King may in some degree be entrusted with the power of giving it especially for such crimes as merely relate to himself as every man may remit the injurys done to himself but the confession of  Edward  the third  That the Oath of the Crown had not bin kept by reason of  Edw  the grant of Pardons contrary to Statutes  and a new Act made  that all such Charters of Pardon from henceforth granted against the Oath of the Crown and the said Statutes should be held for none  demonstrates that this power was not in himself but granted by the Nation and to be executed according to such rules as the Law prescrib'd and the Parliament approv'd  Moreover there have bin many and sometimes bloody contests for the Crown upon which the Nation was almost equally divided and it being difficult for them to know or even for us who have all the partys before us to judg which was the better side it was understood that he who came to be crown'd by the consent of the People was acceptable to all and the question being determin'd it was no way fit that he should have a liberty to make use of the publick Authority then in his hands to revenge such personal injurys as he had or might suppose to have receiv'd which might raise new and perhaps more dangerous troubles if the Authors of them were still kept in fear of being prosecuted and nothing could be more unreasonable than that he should employ his power to the destruction of those who had consented to make him King This made it a matter of course for a King as soon as he was crown'd to issue out a general Pardon which was no more than to declare that being now what he was not before he had no enemy upon any former account For this reason  Lewis  the twelfth of  France  when he was incited to revenge himself against those who in the reign of his Predecessor  Charles  the eighth had caus'd him to be imprison'd with great danger of his life made this answer  That the King of  France  did not care to revenge the injurys done to the Duke of  Orleans and the last King of  Sweden  seem'd no otherwise to remember who had oppos'd the Queen's Abdication and his Election than by conferring honors upon them because he knew they were the best men of the Nation and such as would be his friends when they should see how he would govern in which he was not deceiv'd But lest all those who might come to the Crown of  England  should not have the same prudence and generosity the Kings were oblig'd by a Custom of no less force than a Law immediately to put an end to all disputes and the inconveniences that might arise from them This did not proceed from the bounty of the Prerogative which I think is nonsense for tho he that enjoys the Prerogative may have bounty  the Prerogative can have none but from common sense from the King's obligation and the care of his own safety and could have no other effect in Law than what related to his person as appears by the foremention'd Statute  Pardons granted by Act of Parliament are of another nature For as the King who has no other power than by Law can no otherwise dispense with the crimes committed against the Laws than the Law dos enable him the Parliament that has the power of making Laws may intirely abolish the crimes and unquestionably remit the punishment as they please  Tho some words of  Aristotle  's Ethicks are without any coherence shuffled together by our Author with others taken out of his Politicks I do not much except against them No Law made by man can be perfect and there must be in every Nation a power of correcting such defects as in time may arise or be discover'd This power can never be so rightly plac'd as  in the same Hand that has the right of making Laws whether in one person or in many  If  Filmer  therefore can tell us of a place where one man woman or child however he or she be qualify'd has the power of making Laws I will acknowledg that not only the  hard Cases  but as many others as he pleases are refer'd to his or her judgment and that they may give it whether they have any understanding of what they do or not whether they be drunk or sober in their senses or stark mad But as I know no such place and should not be much concern'd for the sufferings of a People that might bring such misery upon themselves as must accompany an absolute dependence upon the unruly will of such a creature I may leave him to seek it and rest in a perfect assurance that he dos not speak of  England  which acknowledges no other Law than its own and instead of receiving any from Kings dos to this day obey none but such as have bin made by our Ancestors or our selves and never admitted any King that did not swear to observe them And if  Aristotle  deserve credit the power of altering mitigating explaining or correcting the Laws of  England  is only in the Parliament  because none but the  Parliament  can make them  SECT XXIII  Aristotle  proves that no man is to be intrusted with an absolute Power by shewing that no one knows how to execute it but such a man as is not to be found  OUR Author having falsly cited and perverted the sense of  Aristotle  now brings him in saying  That a perfect Kingdom is that wherein the King rules all according to his own Will  But tho I have read his books of Government with some attention I can find no such thing in them unless the word which signifies  mere  or  absolute  may be justly translated into  perfect  which is so far from  Aristotle  's meaning that he distinguishes the absolute or despotical Kingdoms from the Legitimate and commending the latter gives no better name than that of  barbarous  to the first which he says can agree only with the nature of such Nations as are base and stupid little differing from Beasts and having no skill to  govern or courage to defend themselves must resign all to the will of one that will take care of them Yet even this cannot be done unless he that should take that care be wholly exempted from the vices which oblige the others to stand in need of it for otherwise 'tis no better than if a Sheep should undertake to govern Sheep or a Hog to command Swine  Aristotle  plainly saying  That as men are by nature equal if it were  Polit l c  possible all should be Magistrats  But that being repugnant to the nature of Government he finds no other way of solving the difficulty than by  obeying and commanding alternately  that they may do by turns that which they cannot do all together and to which no one man has more right than another because they are all by nature equal This might be compos'd by a more compendious way if according to our Author's doctrin Possession could give a Right But  Aristotle  speaking like a Philosopher and not like a publick Enemy to Mankind examins what is just reasonable and beneficial to men that is what ought to be done and which being done is to be accounted just and therefore to be supported by good men But as  Quod ab initio injustum est nullum potest habere juris effectum  Grot de jur bel pac l    that which is unjust in the beginning can never have the effect of Justice  and it being manifestly unjust for one or a few men to assume a power over those who by nature are equal to them no such power can be just or beneficial to mankind nor fit to be upheld by good men if it be unjust and prejudicial In the opinion of  Aristotle  this natural equality continues till vertue makes the distinction which must be either simply compleat and perfect in it self so that he who is endu'd with it is a God among men or relatively as far as concerns civil Society and the ends for which it is constituted that is defence and the obtaining of Justice This requires a mind unbiass'd by passion full of goodness and wisdom firm against all the temptations to ill that may arise from desire or fear tending to all manner of good thro a perfect knowledg and affection to it and this to such a degree that he or they have more of these vertues and excellencys than all the rest of the Society tho computed together Where such a man is found he is by nature a  Ibid l  King and 'tis best for the Nation where he is that he govern If a few men tho equal and alike among themselves have the same advantages above the rest of the People Nature for the same reason seems to establish an Aristocracy in that place and the power is more safely committed to them than left in the hands of the multitude But if this excellency of vertue dos not appear in one nor in a few men the right and power is by nature equally lodg'd in all and to assume or appropriate that power to one or a few men is unnatural and tyrannical which in  Aristotle  's language comprehends all that is detestable and abominable  If any man should think  Aristotle  a trifler for speaking of such a man as can never be found I answer that he went as  ar as his way could be warranted by reason or nature and was oblig'd to stop there by the defect of his Subject He could not say that the Government os one was simply good when he knew so many qualifications were requir'd in the person to make it so nor that it is good for a Nation to be under the power of a sool a coward or a villain because 'tis good to be under a man of admirable wisdom valor industry and goodness or that the Government of one should be continu'd in such as by chance succeed in a Family because it was given to the first who had all the vertues requir'd  tho all the reasons for which the power was given fail in the Successor much less could he say that any Government was good which was not good for those whose good only it was constituted to promote  Moreover by shewing who only is fit to be a Monarch or may be made such without violating the Laws of Nature and Justice he shews who cannot be one and he who says that no such man is to be found as according to the opinion of  Aristotle  can be a Monarch dos most ridiculously alledg his Authority in favor of Monarchs or the power which some amongst us would attribute to them If any thing therefore may be concluded from his words 'tis this That since no power ought to be admitted which is not just that none can be just which is not good profitable to the People and conducing to the ends for which it is constituted that no man can know how to direct the power to those ends can deserve or administer it unless he dos so far excel all those that are under him in wisdom justice valor and goodness as to possess more of those vertues than all of them I say if no such man or succession of men be found no such power is to be granted to any man or succession of men But if such power be granted the Laws of nature and reason are overthrown and the ends for which Societys are constituted utterly perverted which necessarily implys an annihilation of the Grant And if a Grant so made by those who have a right of setting up a Government amongst themselves do perish thro its own natural iniquity and perversity I leave it to any man whose understanding and manners are not so intirely corrupted as those of our Author to determin what name ought to be given to that person who not excelling all others in Civil and Moral Vertues in the proportion requir'd by  Aristotle  dos usurp a power over a Nation and what obedience the People owe to such a one But if his opinion deserve our regard the King by having those vertues is  Omnium Optimus  and the best guide to the People  Ad summum bonum secundum virtutem  Arist Pol  to lead them to happiness by the ways of vertue  And he who assumes the same power without the qualifications requir'd is  Tyrannus omnium pessimus  leading the People to all manner of ill and in consequence to destruction  SECT XXIV The Power of  Augustus Cesar  was not given but usurp'd  OUR Author's next instance is ingeniously taken from the  Romans Who  he says  tho they were a People greedy of Liberty freed  Augustus  from the necessity of Laws  If it be true as he affirms that such a Prerogative is instituted only for the preservation of Liberty they who are most greedy of it ought to be most forward in establishing that which defends it best But if the weight laid upon the words  greedy of Liberty  c render his memory and judgment liable to censure the unpardonable prevarication of citing any act done by the  Romans  in the time of  Augustus  as done freely shews him to be a man of no faith  Omnium jura in se traxerat  says  Tacitus  of  Augustus  nothing was confer'd upon him he took all to himself there could be nothing of right in that which was wholly usurp'd and neither the People or the Senat could do any  thing freely whilst they were under the power of a mad corrupted Soldiery who first betray'd and then subdu'd them The greatest part of the Senat had fall'n at the battel of  Pharsalia  others had bin glean'd up in several places the rest destroy'd by the Proscriptions and that which then retain'd the name of a Senat was made up chiefly of those who had bin his Ministers in bringing the most miserable slavery upon their own Country The  Roman  Liberty and that bravery of spirit by which it had bin maintain'd was not only abolish'd but almost forgotten All consideration of Law and Right was trampl'd under foot and none could dispute with him who by the power of the sword had seiz'd the Authority both of the Senat and People Nothing was so extravagant that might not be extorted by the insolent violence of a Conqueror who had thirty mercenary Legions to execute his Commands The uncorrupted part of the People that had escap'd the sword of  Julius  had either perish'd with  Hirtius  and  Pansa Brutus  and  Cassius  or bin destroy'd by the detestable  Triumvirate  Those that remain'd could lose nothing by a verbal resignation of their Liberty which they had neither strength nor courage to defend The Magistracys were possest by the Creatures of the Tyrant and the People were compos'd of such as were either born under slavery and accustom'd to obey or remain'd under the terror of those Arms that had consum'd the Assertors of their Liberty Our Author standing in need of some  Roman  Example was oblig'd to seek it in an age when the Laws were subverted Vertue extinguish'd Injustice plac'd in the Throne and such as would not be of the same spirit expos'd to the utmost cruelty This was the time when the  Sovereign Majesty  shin'd in glory and they who had rais'd it above the Law made it also the object of their Religion by adoring the Statues of their Oppressor The corruption of this Court spread it self over the best part of the World and reduc'd the Empire to that irrecoverable weakness in which it languish'd and perish'd This is the state of things that pleases  Filmer  and those that are like him who for the introduction of the same among us recommend such an elevation of the Sovereign Majesty as is most contrary to the Laws of God and Men abhor'd by all generous Nations and most especially by our Ancestors who thought nothing too dear to be hazarded in the defence of themselves and us from it  SECT XXV The Regal Power was not the first in this Nation nor necessarily to be continu'd tho it had bin the first  TRUTH being uniform in it self those who desire to propagate it for the good of Mankind lay the foundations of their reasonings in such Principles as are either evident to common sense or easily prov'd but Cheats and Impostors delighting in obscurity suppose things that are dubious and false and think to build one falshood upon another and our Author can find no better way to persuade us that all our Privileges and Laws are from the King than by saying  That the first Power was the Kingly Power which was both in this and all other Nations  in the world long before any Laws or any other kind of Government was thought of from whence we must necessarily infer that the common Law or common Customs of this Land were originally the Laws and Commands of the King  But denying both these points I affirm  That there was a power to make Kings before there was any King  Tho Kings had bin the first created Magistrats in all places as perhaps they were in some it dos not follow that they must continue for ever or that Laws are from them  To the first I think no man will deny that there was a People at  Babylon  before  Nimrod  was King of that place This People had a Power for no number of men can be without it Nay this People had a power of making  Nimrod  King or he could never have bin King He could not be King by succession for the Scripture shews him to have bin the first He was not King by the right of Father for he was not their Father  Chush Cham  with his elder Brothers and Father  Noah  being still living and which is worst of all were not Kings for if they who liv'd in  Nimrod  's time or before him neither were Kings nor had Kings he that ought to have bin King over all by the right of nature if there had bin any such thing in nature was not King Those who immediately succeeded him and must have inherited his right if he had any did not inherit or pretend to it and therefore he that shall now claim a right from nature as Father of a People must ground it upon something more certain than  Noah  's right of reigning over his Children or it can have no strength in it  Moreover the Nations who in and before the time of  Nimrod  had no Kings had Power or else they could have perform'd no Act nor constituted any other Magistrate to this day which is absurd There was therefore a power in Nations before there were Kings or there could never have bin any and  Nimrod  could never have bin King if the People of  Babylon  had not made him King which they could not have done if they had not had a power of making him so 'Tis ridiculous to say he made himself King for tho he might be strong and valiant he could not be stronger than a multitude of men That which forces must be stronger than that which is forc'd and if it be true according to the antient saying that  Hercules  himself is not sufficient to encounter two 'tis sure more impossible for one man to force a multitude for that must be stronger than he If he came in by persuasion they who were persuaded were persuaded to consent that he should be King That Consent therefore made him King But  Qui dat esse dat modum esse  They who made him King made him such a King as best pleas'd themselves He had therefore nothing but what was given his greatness and power must be from the multitude who gave it and their Laws and Libertys could not be from him but their Libertys were naturally inherent in themselves and their Laws were the product of them  There was a People that made  Romulus  King He did not make or beget that People nor for any thing we know one man of them He could not come in by inheritance for he was a Bastard the Son of an unknown man and when he dy'd the right that had bin confer'd upon him reverted to the People who according to that right chose  Numa Hostilius Martius Tarquinius Priscas  and  Servius  all Stranges to his blood and without any other right than what was bestow'd upon them and  Tarquinius Superbus  who invaded the Throne  Sinc jussu populi  T Liv l    without the command  of the People  was ejected and the Government of Kings abolish'd by the same power that had created it  We know not certainly by what Law  Moses  and the Judges created by the advice of  Jethro  govern'd the  Israelites  but may probably conjecture it to have bin by that Law which God had written in the hearts of mankind and the People submitted to the judgment of good and wise men tho they were under no coercive Power But 'tis certain they had a Law and a regular Magistracy under which they liv'd four hundred years before they had a King for  Saul  was the first This Law was not therefore from the King nor by the King but the King was chosen and made by the People according to the liberty they had by the Law tho they did not rightly follow the rules therein prescrib'd and by that means brought destruction upon themselves  The Country in which we live lay long conceal'd under obscure barbarity and we know nothing of the first Inhabitants but what is involv'd in fables that leave us still in the dark  Julius Cesar  is the first who speaks distinctly of our affairs and gives us no reason to believe there was any Monarchy then establish'd amongst us  Cassivellaunus  was occasionally chosen by the Nations that were most expos'd to the violence  Caes Comment l  of the  Romans  for the management of those wars against them By others we hear of  Boadicia Arviragus Galgacus  and many more set up afterwards when need requir'd but we find no footsteps of a regular Succession either by inheritance or election And as they had then no Kings or any other general Magistrate that can be said to be equivalent to a King they might have had none at all unless they had thought fit  Tacitus  mentions a sort of Kings us'd by the  Romans  to keep  Inter instrumenta servitutis reges habu  re  C Tacit  Nations in servitude to them and tho it were true that there had bin such a man as  Lucius  and he one of this sort he is to be accounted only as a  Roman  Magistrate and signifys no more to our dispute than if he had bin call'd Proconsul Pretor or by any other name However there was no series of them that which was temporary and occasional depended upon the will of those who thinking there was occasion created such a Magistrate and omitted to do so when the occasion ceas'd or was thought to cease and might have had none at all if they had so pleas'd The Magistracy therefore was from them and depenedd upon their will  We have already mention'd the Historys of the  Saxons Danes  and  Normans  from which Nations together with the  Britans  we are descended and finding that they were severe Assertors of their Libertys acknowledg'd no human Laws but their own receiv'd no Kings but such as swore to observe them and depos'd those who did not well perform their Oaths and Duty 'tis evident that their Kings were made by the People according to the Law and that the Law by which they became what they were could not be from themselves Our Ancestors were so fully convinc'd that in the creation of Kings they exercis'd their own right and were only to consider what was good for themselves that without regard to the memory of those who had gone before they were accustom'd to take such as seem'd most like wisely justly and gently to perform their office refus'd those that were suspected of pride cruelty or any other vice that might bring prejudice upon the Publick what title soever they pretended and remov'd such as had bin plac'd in the Throne if they did not answer the opinion conceiv'd of  their vertue which I take to be a manner of proceeding that agrees better with the quality of Masters making Laws and Magistrats for themselves than of Slaves receiving such as were impos'd upon them  To the second Tho it should be granted that all Nations had at the first bin govern'd by Kings it were nothing to the question for no man or number of Men was ever oblig'd to continue in the errors of his Predecessors The Authority of Custom as well as of Law I mean in relation to the Power that made it to be consists only in its rectitude And the same reason which may have induc'd one or more Nations to create Kings when they knew no other form of Government may not only induce them to set up another if that be found inconvenient to them but proves that they may as justly do so as remove a man who performs not what was expected from him If there had bin a Rule given by God and written in the minds of men by nature it must have bin from the beginning universal and perpetual or at least must have bin observ'd by the wisest and best instructed Nations which not being in any measure as I have prov'd already there can be no reason why a polite People should not relinquish the errors committed by their Ancestors in the time of their barbarism and ignorance and why they should not do it in matters of Government as well as in any other thing relating to life Men are subject to errors and 'tis the work of the best and wisest to discover and amend such as their Ancestors may have committed or to add perfection to those things which by them have bin well invented This is so certain that whatsoever we enjoy beyond the misery in which our barbarous Ancestors liv'd is due only to the liberty of correcting what was amiss in their practice or inventing that which they did not know and I doubt whether it be more brutish to say we are oblig'd to continue in the Idolatry of the  Druids  with all the miserys and follys that accompany the most savage barbarity or to confess that tho we have a right to depart from these yet we are for ever bound to continue the Government they had establish'd whatever inconveniences might attend it  Tertullian  disputing with the  Pagans  who objected the novelty of the Christian Religion troubled not himself with refuting that error  Nullum tempu    ulla praescriptio occurrit vericuti  Tertul  Id antiquius quod verius  Ibid  but proving Christianity to be good and true he thought he had sufficiently prov'd it to be antient A wise Architect may shew his skill and deserve commendation for building a poor house of vile materials when he can procure no better but he no way ought to hinder others from erecting more glorious Fabricks if they are furnish'd with the means requir'd Besides such is the imperfection of all human Constitutions that they are subject to perpetual fluctuation which never permits them to continue long in the same condition Corruptions slide in insensibly and the best Orders are sometimes subverted by malice and violence so that he who only regards what was done in such an age often takes the corruption of the State for the institution follows the worst example thinks that to be the first that is the most antient he knows and if a brave People seeing the original defects of their Government or the corruption into which it may be fallen do either correct and reform what may be amended or abolish that which was evil in the institution or so perverted that it cannot be restor'd to integrity these men impute it to sedition and blame those actions which of all that can be perform'd by men are the most glorious We are not therefore so much to inquire after  that which is most antient as that which is best and most conducing to the good ends to which it was directed As Governments were instituted for the obtaining of Justice and as our Author says the preservation of Liberty we are not to seek what Government was the first but what best provides for the obtaining of Justice and the preservation of Liberty For whatsoever the Institution be and how long soever it may have lasted 'tis void if it thwarts or dos not provide for the end of its establishment If such a Law or Custom therefore as is not good in it self had in the beginning prevail'd in all parts of the world which in relation to absolute or any kind of Monarchy is not true it ought to be abolish'd and if any man should shew himself wiser than others by proposing a Law or Government more beneficial to mankind than any that had bin formerly known providing better for Justice and Liberty than all others had done he would merit the highest veneration If any man ask who shall be Judg of that rectitude or pravity which either authorises or destroys a Law I answer that as this consists not in formalitys and nicetys but in evident and substantial truths there is no need of any other Tribunal than that of common sense and the light of nature  o determin the matter and he that travels thro  France Italy Turky Germany  and  Switzerland  without consulting  Bartolus  or  Baldus  will easily understand whether the Countrys that are under the Kings of  France  and  Spain  the Pope and the Great  Turk  or such as are under the care of a wellregulated Magistracy do best enjoy the benefits of Justice and Liberty 'Tis as easily determin'd whether the  Grecians  when  Athens  and  Thebes  flourish'd were more free than the  Medes  whether Justice was better administer'd by  Agathocles Dionysius  and  Phalaris  than by the legal Kings and regular Magistrats of  Sparta  or whether more care was taken that Justice and Liberty might be preserv'd by  Tiberius Caligula Claudius Nero  and  Vitellius  than by the Senat and People of  Rome  whilst the Laws were more powerful than the commands of men The like may be said of particular Laws as those of  Nabuchodonosor  and  Caligula  for worshipping their Statues our Acts of Parliament against Hereticks and Lollards with the Statutes and Orders of the Inquisition which is call'd the Holy Office And if that only be a Law which is  Sanctio recta jubens honesta prohibens contraria  the meanest understanding if free from passion may certainly know that such as these cannot be Laws by what Authority soever they were enacted and that the use of them and others like to them ought to be abolish'd for their turpitude and iniquity Infinite examples of the like nature might be alledg'd as well concerning divine as human things And if there be any Laws which are evil there cannot be an incontestable rectitude in all and if not in all it concerns us to examin where it is to be found Laws and Constitutions ought to be weigh'd and whilst all due reverence is paid to such as are good every Nation may not only retain in it self a power of changing or abolishing all such as are not so but ought to exercise that Power according to the best of their understanding and in the place of what was either at first mistaken or afterwards corrupted to constitute that which is most conducing to the establishment of Justice and Liberty  But such is the condition of mankind that nothing can be so perfectly fram'd as not to give some testimony of human imbecillity and frequently to stand in need of reparations and amendments Many things are unknown to the wisest and the best men can never wholly devest themselves of passions and affections By this means the best and wisest are  sometimes led into Error and stand in need of Successors like to themselves who may find remedys for the faults they have committed and nothing can or ought to be permanent but that which is perfect No natural body was ever so well temper'd and organiz'd as not to be subject to diseases wounds or other accidents and to need medicins and other occasional helps as well as nourishment and exercise and he who under the name of Innovation would deprive Nations of the like dos as much as lies in him condemn them all to perish by the defects of their own foundations  Discors di Macchiav l  Some men observing this have propos'd a necessity of reducing every State once in an age or two to the integrity of its first principle but they ought to have examin'd whether that principle be good or evil or so good that nothing can be added to it which none ever was and this being so those who would admit of no change would render Errors perpetual and depriving Mankind of the benefits of Wisdom Industry Experience and the right use of Reason oblige all to continue in the miserable barbarity of their Ancestors which sutes better with the nature of a Wolf than that of a Man  Those who are of better understanding weigh all things and often find reason to abrogate that which their fathers according to the measure of the knowledg they had or the state of things among them had rightly instituted or to restore that which they had abrogated and there can be no greater mark of a most brutish stupidity than for men to continue in an evil way because their fathers had brought them into it But if we ought not too strictly to adhere to our own Constitutions those of other Nations are less to be regarded by us for the Laws that may be good for one People are not for all and that which agrees with the manners of one Age is utterly abhorrent from those of another It were absurd to think of restoring the Laws of  Lycurgus  to the present inhabitants of  Peloponnesus  who are accustom'd to the most abject slavery It may easily be imagin'd how the  Romans Sabins  and  Latins  now under the tyranny of the Pope would relish such a disciplin as flourish'd among them after the expulsion of the  Tarquins  and it had bin no less preposterous to give a liberty to the  Parthians  of governing themselves or for them to assume it than to impose an absolute Monarch upon the  German  Nation  Hist l  Titus Livius  having observ'd this says that if a popular Government had bin set up in  Rome  immediately upon the building of the City and if that fierce people which was compos'd of unruly shepherds herdsmen fugitive slaves and out law'd persons who could not suffer the Government under which they wereborn had come to be incited by turbulent Orators they would have brought all into confusion whereas that boisterous humor being gradually temper'd by disciplin under  Romulus  or taught to vent its fury against foreign enemys and soften'd by the peaceable reign of  Numa  a new Race grew up which being all of one blood contracted a love to their Country and became capable of Liberty which the madness of their last King and the leudness of his Son gave them occasion to resume If this was commendable in them it must be so in other Nations If the  Germans  might preserve their Liberty as well as the  Parthians  submit themselves to absolute Monarchy 'tis as lawful for the descendents of those  Germans  to continue in it as for the Eastern Nations to be slaves If one Nation may justly chuse the Government that seems best to them and continue or alter it according to the changes of times and things the same right must belong to others The great variety of Laws that are or have bin in the world proceeds  from this and nothing can better shew the wisdom and vertue or the vices and folly of Nations than the use they make of this right they have bin glorious or infamous powerful or despicable happy or miserable as they have well or ill executed it  If it be said that the Law given by God to the  Hebrews  proceeding from his wisdom and goodness must needs be perfect and obligatory to all Nations I answer that there is a simple and a relative perfection the first is only in God the other in the things he has created  He saw that they were good  which can signify no more than that  Gen  they were good in their kind and suted to the end for which he design'd them For if the perfection were absolute there could be no difference between an Angel and a Worm and nothing could be subject to change or death for that is imperfection This relative perfection is seen also by his Law given to mankind in the persons of  Adam  and  Noah  It was good in the kind fit for those times but could never have bin enlarg'd or alter'd if the perfection had bin simple and no better evidence can be given to shew that it was not so than that God did afterwards give one much more full and explicit to his People This Law also was peculiarly applicable to that People and Season for if it had bin otherwise the Apostles would have oblig'd Christians to the intire observation of it as well as to abstain from idolatry fornication and blood But if all this be not so then their judicial Law and the form of their Commonwealth must be receiv'd by all no human Law can be of any value we are all Brethren no man has a prerogative above another Lands must be equally divided amongst all Inheritances cannot be alienated for above fifty years no man can be rais'd above the rest unless he be call'd by God and enabled by his Spirit to conduct the People When this man dies he that has the same Spirit must succeed as  Joshua  did to  Moses  and his Children can have no title to his Office when such a man appears a  Sanhedrim  of seventy men chosen out of the whole People are to judg such causes as relate to themselves whilst those of greater extent and importance are refer'd to the General Assemblys Here is no mention of a King and consequently if we must take this Law for our pattern we cannot have one If the point be driven to the utmost and the precept of  Deuteronomy  where God permitted them to have a King if they thought fit when they came into the promis'd Land be understood to extend to all Nations every one of them must have the same liberty of taking their own time chusing him in their own way dividing the Kingdom having no King and setting up other Governors when they please as before the Election of  Saul  and after the return from the Captivity and even when they have a King he must be such a one as is describ'd in the same Chapter who no more resembles the Sovereign Majesty that our Author adores and agrees as little with his Maxims as a Tribun of the Roman People  We may therefore conclude that if we are to follow the Law of  Moses  we must take it with all the appendages a King can be no more and no otherwise than he makes him for whatever we read of the Kings they had were extreme deviations from it No Nation can make any Law and our Lawyers burning their Books may betake themselves to the study of the Pentateuch in which tho some of them may be well vers'd yet probably the profit arising from thence will not be very great  But if we are not oblig'd to live in a conformity to the Law of  Moses  every People may frame Laws for themselves and we cannot be deny'd the right that is common to all Our Laws were not sent from Heaven but made by our Ancestors according to the light they had and their present occasions We inherit the same right from them and as we may without vanity say that we know a little more than they did if we find our selves prejudic'd by any Law that they made we may repeal it The safety of the People was their supreme Law and is so to us neither can we be thought less fit to judg what conduces to that end than they were If they in any Age had bin persuaded to put themselves under the power or in our Author's phrase under the sovereign Majesty of a child a fool a mad or desperately wicked person and had annex'd the right confer'd upon him to such as should succeed it had not bin a  just and right Sanction  and having none of the qualitys essentially belonging to a Law could not have the effect of a Law It cannot be for the good of a People to be govern'd by one who by nature ought to be govern'd or by age or accident is render'd unable to govern himself The publick interests and the concernments of private men in their lands goods libertys and lives for the preservation of which our Author says the regal Prerogative is only constituted cannot be preserv'd by one who is transported by his own passions or follys a slave to his lusts and vices or which is sometimes worse govern'd by the vilest of men and women who flatter him in them and push him on to do such things as even they would abhor if they were in his place The turpitude and impious madness of such an act must necessarily make it void by overthrowing the ends for which it was made since that justice which was sought cannot be obtain'd nor the evils that were fear'd prevented and they for whose good it was intended must necessarily have a right of abolishing it This might be sufficient for us tho our Ancestors had enslav'd themselves But God be thank'd we are not put to that trouble We have no reason to believe we are descended from such fools and beasts as would willingly cast themselves and us into such an excess of misery and shame or that they were so tame and cowardly to be subjected by force or fear We know the value they set upon their Libertys and the courage with which they defended them and we can have no better example to incourage us never to suffer them to be violated or diminish'd  SECT XXVI Tho the King may be entrusted with the power of chusing Judges yet that by which they act is from the Law  I Confess that no Law can be so perfect  to provide exactly for every case that may fall out so as to leave nothing to the discretion of the Judges  who in some measure are to interpret them But  that Laws or Customs are ever few or that the paucity is the reason that they cannot give special rules or that Judges do resort to those Principles or Common Law Axioms whereupon former Judgments in cases something alike have bin  given by former Judges who all receive their Authority from the King in his right to give Sentence  I utterly deny and affirm  That in many places and particularly in  England  the Laws are so many that the number of them has introduc'd an uncertainty and confusion which is both dangerous and troublesom and the infinite variety of adjudg'd cases thwarting and contradicting each other has render'd these difficultys inextricable  Tacitus  imputes a great part of the miserys suffer'd by the  Romans  in his time to this abuse and tells us that  Et in corruptissima Republica plurimae Leges  the Laws grew to be innumerable in the worst and most corrupt state of things  and that Justice was overthrown by them By the same means in  France Italy  and other places where the Civil Law is render'd municipal Judgments are in a manner arbitrary and tho the intention of our Laws be just and good they are so numerous and the volumes of our Statutes with the Interpretations and adjudg'd Cases so vast that hardly any thing is so clear and fix'd but men of wit and learning may find what will serve for a pretence to justify almost any judgment they have a mind to give Whereas the Laws of  Moses  as to the Judicial part being short and few Judgments were easy and certain and in  Switzerland Sweden  and some parts of  Denmark  the whole Volume that contains them may be read in few hours and by that means no injustice can be done which is not immediately made evident  Axioms are not rightly grounded upon judg'd Cases but Cases are to be judg'd according to Axioms the certain is not prov'd by the uncertain but the uncertain by the certain and every thing is to be esteem'd uncertain till it be prov'd to be certain Axioms in Law are as in Mathematicks evident to common sense and nothing is to be taken for an Axiom that is not so  Euclid  dos not prove his Axioms by his Propositions but his Propositions which are abstruse by such Axioms as are evident to all The Axioms of our Law do not receive their Authority from  Coke  and  Hales  but  Coke  and  Hales  deserve praise for giving judgment according to such as are undeniably true  The Judges reeeive their Commissions from the King and perhaps it may be said that the Custom of naming them is grounded upon a right with which he is entrusted but their power is from the Law as that of the King also is For he who has none originally in himself can give none unless it be first confer'd upon him I know not how he can well perform his Oath to govern according to Law unless he execute the power with which he is entrusted in naming those men to be Judges whom in his conscience and by the advice of his Council he thinks the best and ablest to perform that Office But both he and they are to learn their duty from that Law by which they are and which allots to every one his proper work As the Law intends that men should be made Judges for their integrity and knowledg in the Law and that it ought not to be imagin'd that the King will break his trust by chusing such as are not so till the violation be evident nothing is more reasonable than to intend that the Judges so qualify'd should instruct the King in matters of Law But that he who may be a child overag'd or otherwise ignorant and uncapable should instruct the Judges is equally absurd as for a blind man to be a guide to those who have the best eyes and so abhorrent from the meaning of the Law that the Judges as I said before  are sworn to do justice according to the Laws without any regard to the King's words letters or commands If they are therefore to act according to a set rule from which they may not depart what command soever they receive they do not act by a power from him but by one that is above both This is commonly confest and tho some Judges have bin found in several ages who in hopes of reward and preferment have made little account of their Oath yet the success that many of them have had may reasonably deter others from following their example and if there are not more instances in this kind no better reason can be given than that  Jure igitur plectimur nisi enim multorum impunita feeler  tulissemus nunquam ad unum tanta pervenisset licentia  Cicero  Nations do frequently fail by being too remiss in asserting their own rights or punishing offenders and hardly ever err on the severer side  Judgments are variously given in several States and Kingdoms but he who would find one where they lie in the breast of the King must go at least as far as  Morocco  Nay the Embassador who was lately here from that place deny'd that they were absolutely in him However 'tis certain that in  England  according to the Great Charter  Jud  ia  iunt per pares  Mag Chart  Judgments are pass'd by equals  no man can be imprison'd disseiz'd of his Freehold depriv'd of Life or Limb  Ni  per judicium parium suorum  Ibid  unless by the sentence of his Peers  The Kings of  Judah  did  Judicabant judicabantur  Maimonid  judg and were judg'd  and the Judgments they gave were in and with the Sanhedrin In  England  the Kings do not judg but are judg'd and  Bracton  says  In justitia recipienda rex cuilibet ex plebe aqualis est  That in receiving justice the King is equal to another man  which could not be if judgments were given by him and he were exempted from the judgment of all by that Law which has put all judgments into the hands of the People This power is executed by them in grand or petty Jurys and the Judges are assistants to them in explaining the difficult points of the Law in which 'tis presum'd they should be learned The strength of every judgment consists in the verdict of these Jurys which the Judges do not give but pronounce or declare and the same Law that makes good a verdict given contrary to the advice or direction of the Judges exposes them to the utmost penaltys if upon their own heads or a command from the King they should presume to give a Sentence without or contrary to a Verdict and no pretensions to a power of interpreting the Law can exempt them if they break it The power also with which the Judges are entrusted is but of a moderate extent and to be executed  bona side  Prevarications are capital as they prov'd to  Tresilian Empson Dudley  and many others Nay even in special Verdicts the Judges are only assistants to the Jurys who find it specially and the Verdict is from them tho the Judges having heard the point argu'd declare the sense of the Law thereupon Wherefore if I should grant that the King might personally assist in judgments his work could only be to prevent frauds and by the advice of the Judges to see that the Laws be duly executed or perhaps to inspect their behaviour If he has more than this it must be by virtue of his politick capacity in which he is understood to be always present in the principal Courts where Justice is always done whether he who wears the Crown be young or old wise or ignorant good or bad or whether he like or dislike what is done  Moreover as Governments are instituted for the obtaining of Justice and the King is in a great measure entrusted with the power of executing it 'tis probable that the Law would have requir'd his presence in the distribution if there had bin but one Court that at the same time he could be present in more than one that it were certain he would be guilty of no miscarriages that all miscarriages were to be punish'd in him as well as in the Judges or that it were certain he should always be a man of such wisdom industry experience and integrity as to be an assistance to and a watch over those who are appointed for the administration of Justice But there being many Courts sitting at the same time of equal Authority in several places far distant from each other it being impossible for the King to be present in all there being no manner of assurance that the same or greater miscarriages may not be committed in his presence than in his absence by himself than others no opportunity of punishing every delict in him without bringing the Nation into such disorder as may be of more prejudice to the publick than an injury done to a private man the Law which intends to obviate offences or to punish such as cannot be obviated has directed that those men should be chosen who are most knowing in it imposes an Oath upon them not to be diverted from the due course of justice by fear or favor hopes or reward particularly by any command from the King and appoints the severest punishments for them if they prove false to God and their Country  If any man think that the words cited from  Bracton  by our Author upon the question  Quis primo principaliter possit debeat judicare c Sciendum est quod Rex non alius si solus ad haec sufficere possit cum ad hoc per virtutem Sacramenti teneatur  are contrary to what I have said I desire the context may be consider'd that his opinion may be truly understood tho the words taken simply and nakedly may be enough for my purpose For 'tis ridiculous to infer that the King has a right of doing any thing upon a supposition that 'tis impossible for him to do it He therefore who says the King cannot do it says it must be done by others or not at all But having already prov'd that the King merely as King has none of the qualitys requir'd for judging all or any cases and that many Kings have all the defects of age and person that render men most unable and unfit to give any Sentence we may conclude without contradicting  Bracton  that no King as King has a power of judging because some of them are utterly unable and unfit to do it and if any one has such a power it must be confer'd upon him by those who think him able and fit to perform that work When  Filmer  finds such a man we must inquire into the extent of that power which is given to him but this would be nothing to his general proposition for he himself would hardly have infer'd that because a power of judging in some cases was confer'd upon one Prince on account of his fitness and ability therefore all of 'em however unfit and unable have a power of deciding all cases Besides if he believe  Bracton  this power of judging is not inherent in the King but incumbent upon him by virtue of his Oath which our Author endeavours to enervate and annul But as that Oath is grounded upon the Law and the Law cannot presume impossibilitys and absurditys it cannot intend and the Oath cannot require that a man should do that which he is unable and unfit to do Many Kings are unfit to judg causes the Law cannot therefore intend they should do it The Context also shews that this imagination of the King's judging all causes if he  could is merely chimerical for  Bracton  says in the same Chapter that  the power of the King is the Power of the Law  that is that he has no power but by the Law And the Law that aims at justice cannot make it to depend upon the uncertain humor of a Child a Woman or a foolish Man for by that means it would destroy it self The Law cannot therefore give any such power and the King cannot have it  If it be said that all Kings are not so that some are of mature age wise just and good or that the question is not what is good for the Subject but what is glorious to the King and that he must not lose his right tho the People perish I answer first that whatsoever belongs to Kings as Kings belongs to all Kings this Power of judging cannot belong to all for the Reasons abovemention'd it cannot therefore belong to any as King nor without madness be granted to any till he has given testimony of such Wisdom Experience Diligence and Goodness as is requir'd for so great a work It imports not what his Ancestors were Vertues are not entail'd and it were less improper for the Heirs of  Hales  and  Harvey  to pretend that the Clients and Patients of their Ancestors should depend upon their advice in matters of Law and Physick than for the Heirs of a great and wise Prince to pretend to Powers given on account of vertue if they have not the same talents for the performance of the works requir'd  Common sense declares that Governments are instituted and Judicatures erected for the obtaining of justice The Kings Bench was not establish'd that the Chief Justice should have a great Office but that the oppressed should be reliev'd and right done The Honor and Profit he receives comes in as it were by accident as the rewards of his service if he rightly perform his duty but he may as well pretend he is there for his own sake as the King God did not set up  Moses  or  Joshua  that they might glory in having six hundred thousand men under their command but that they might lead the People into the Land they were to possess that is they were not for themselves but for the People and the glory they acquir'd was by rightly performing the end of their institution Even our Author is oblig'd to confess this when he says that the King's Prerogative is instituted for the good of those that are under it 'Tis therefore for them that he enjoys it and it can no otherwise subsist than in concurrence with that end He also yields that  the safety of the People is the supreme Law  The right therefore that the King has must be conformable and subordinate to it If any one therefore set up an interest in himself that is not so he breaks this supreme Law he dos not live and reign for his People but for himself and by departing from the end of his institution destroys it and if  Aristotle  to whom our Author seems to have a great deference deserves credit such a one ceases to be a King and becomes a Tyrant he who ought to have bin the best of men is turn'd into the worst and he who is recommended to us under the name of a Father becomes a publick Enemy to the People The question therefore is not what is good for the King but what is good for the People and he can have no right repugnant to them  Bracton  is not more gentle  The King  says he  is oblig'd by his Oath to the utmost of his power to preserve the Church and the Christian World in peace to hinder rapine and all manner of iniquity to cause justice and mercy to be observ'd He has no power but from the Law that only is to be taken for Law quod recte fuerit definitum  he is therefore to cause justice to be done according to that rule and not to pervert it for his own pleasure  profit or glory He may chuse Judges also not such as will be subservient to his will but  Viros sapientes timentes Deum in quibus est  Bract l c  veritas eloquiorum qui oderunt avaritiam  Which proves that Kings and their Officers do not possess their places for themselves but for the People and must be such as are fit and able to perform the dutys they undertake The mischievous fury of those who assume a power above their abilitys is well represented by the known fable of  Phaeton  they think they desire fine things for themselves when they seek their own ruin In conformity to this the same  Bracton  says that  Si quis minus sapiens indoctus sedem judicandi honestatem judicandi sibi praesumserit exalto corruit c perinde  rit ac si gladium poneret in manu furentis  Ibid  If any man who is unskilful assume the seat of justice he falls as from a Precipice c and 'tis the same thing as if a sword be put into the hand of a mad man  which cannot but affect the King as well as those who are chosen by him If he neglect the functions of his Office  he dos unjustly and becomes the Vicegerent of the Devil for he is the Minister of him whose works he dos  This is  Bracton  's opinion but desiring to be a more gentle Interpreter of the Law I only wish that Princes would consider the end of their institution endeavour to perform it measure their own abilitys content themselves with that power which the Laws allow and abhor those Wretches who by flattery and lies endeavour to work upon their frailest Passions by which means they draw upon 'em that hatred of the People which frequently brings them to destruction  Tho  Ʋlpian  's words  Princeps legibus non tenetur  be granted to have bin true in fact with relation to the  Roman  Empire in the time when he liv'd yet they can conclude nothing against us The Liberty of  Rome  had bin overthrown long before by the power of the Sword and the Law render'd subservient to the will of the Usurpers They were not  English  men but  Romans  who lost the Battels of  Pharsalia  and  Philippi  The Carcases of their Senators not ours were expos'd to the Wolves and Vulturs  Pompeius Scipio Lentulus Afranius Petreius Cato Cassius  and  Brutus  were defenders of the  Roman  not the  English  Liberty and that of their Country not ours could only be lost by their defeat Those who were destroy'd by the Proscriptions left  Rome  not  England  to be enslav'd If the best had gain'd the victory it could have bin no advantage to us and their overthrow can be no prejudice Every Nation is to take care of their own Laws and whether any one has had the Wisdom Vertue Fortune and Power to defend them or not concerns only themselves The Examples of great and good men acting freely deserve consideration but they only perish by the ill success of their designs and whatsoever is afterwards done by their subdu'd Posterity ought to have no other effect upon the rest of the world than to admonish them so to join in the defence of their Libertys as never to be brought under the necessity of acting by the command of one to the prejudice of themselves and their Country If the  Roman  greatness persuade us to put an extraordinary value upon what pass'd among them we ought rather to examin what they did said or thought when they enjoy'd that Liberty which was the Mother and Nurse of their Vertue than what they suffer'd or were forc'd to say when fallen under that Slavery which produc'd all manner of corruption and made them the most base and miserable People of the world  For what concerns us the Actions of our Ancestors resemble those of the antient rather than the later  Romans  tho our Government be not the same with theirs in form yet it is in principle and if we are not degenerated we shall rather desire to imitate the  Romans  in the time of their vertue glory power and felicity than what they were in that of their slavery vice shame and misery In the best times when  the Laws were more powerful than the commands of men  fraud was accounted a crime so detestable as not to be imputed to any but Slaves and he who had sought a power above the Law under color of interpreting it would have bin expos'd to scorn or greater punishments if any can be greater than the just scorn of the best men And as neither the  Romans  nor any people of the world have better defended their libertys than the  English  Nation when any attempt has bin made to oppress them by force they ought to be no less careful to preserve them from the more dangerous efforts of fraud and falshood  Our Ancestors were certainly in a low condition in the time of  William  the First Many of their best men had perish'd in the Civil Wars or with  Harold  their valor was great but rough and void of skill The  Normans  by frequent Expeditions into  France Italy  and  Spain  had added subtilty to the boisterous violence of their native climate  William  had engag'd his Faith but broke it and turn'd the power with which he was entrusted to the ruin of those that had trusted him He destroy'd many worthy men carry'd others into  Normandy  and thought himself Master of all He was crafty bold and elated with Victory but the resolution of a brave People was invincible When their Laws and Libertys were in danger they resolved to die or to defend them and made him see he could no otherwise preserve his Crown and Life than by the performance of his Oath and accomplishing the ends of his Election They neither took him to be the giver or interpreter of their Laws and would not suffer him to violate those of their Ancestors In this way they always continu'd and tho perhaps they might want skill to fall upon the surest and easiest means of restraining the lusts of Princes yet they maintain'd their rights so well that the wisest Princes seldom invaded them and the success of those who were so foolish to attempt it was such as may justly deter others from following their unprosperous Examples We have had no King since  William  the First more hardy than  Henry  the  th  and yet he so intirely acknowledg'd the power of making changing and repealing Laws to be in the Parliament as never to attempt any extraordinary thing otherwise than by their Authority It was not he but the Parliament that dissolv'd the Abbys He did not take their Lands to himself but receiv'd what the Parliament thought fit to give him He did not reject the Supremacy of the Pope nor assume any other power in spiritual matters than the Parliament confer'd upon him The intricacys of his Marriages and the legitimation of his Children were settled by the same Power At least one of his Daughters could not inherit the Crown upon any other Title they who gave him a power to dispose of the Crown by will might have given it to his Groom and he was too haughty to ask it from them if he had it in himself which he must have had if the Laws and Judicatures had bin in his hand  This is farther evidenc'd by what pass'd in the Tower between Sir  Thomas Moor  and  Rich  the King's Sollicitor who asking If it would not be  Herberts  's  Hen  th  treason to oppose  Richard Rich  if the Parliament should make him King  Moor  said that was  Casus levis  for the Parliament could make and depose  Kings as they thought fit and then as more conducing to his own case ask'd  Rich  if the Parliament should enact  that God should not be God  whether such as did not submit should be esteem'd Traytors 'Tis evident that a man of the acuteness and learning of Sir  Tho Moor  would not have made use of such an Argument to avoid the necessity of obeying what the Parliament had ordain'd by shewing his Case to be of a nature far above the power of man unless it had bin confest by all men that the Parliament could do whatsoever lay within the reach of human power This may be enough to prove that the King cannot have a power over the Law and if he has it not the power of interpreting Law is absurdly attributed to him since it is founded upon a supposition that he can make them which is false  SECT XXVII  Magna Charta  was not the Original but a Declaration of the  English  Libertys The King's Power is not restrain'd but created by that and other Laws and the Nation that made them can only correct the defects of them  I Agree with our Author that  Magna Charta was not made to restrain the absolute Authority  for no such thing was in being or pretended the folly of such visions seeming to have bin reserv'd to compleat the misfortune and ignominy of our age but it was to assert the native and original Libertys of our Nation by the confession of the King then being that neither he nor his Successors should any way encroach upon them and it cannot be said that the power of Kings is diminish'd by that or any other Law for as they are Kings only by Law the Law may confer power upon one in particular or upon him and his Successors but can take nothing from them because they have nothing except what is given to them But as that which the Law gives is given by those who make the Law they only are capable of judging whether he to whom they gave it do well or ill imploy that power and consequently are only fit to correct the defects that may be found in it Therefore tho I should confess that faults may be found in many Statutes and that the whole body of them is greatly defective it will not follow that the compendious way of referring all to the will of the King should be taken But what defects soever may be in our Law the disease is not so great to require extreme remedys and we may hope for a cheaper cure Our Law may possibly have given away too much from the People and provided only insufficient defences of our Libertys against the incroachments of bad Princes but none who are not in judgment and honesty like to our Author can propose for a remedy to the evils that proceed from the error of giving too much the resignation of all the rest to them And whatever he says 'tis evident that he knows this to be true tho when he denys that the power of King can be restrain'd by Acts of Parliament he endeavours to take advantage of such clauses as were either fraudulently inserted by the King's Officers who till the days of  Henry  the Fifth for the most part had the penning of the publick Acts or thro negligence did not fully explain the intentions of the Legislators which would be to no purpose if all were put into the hands of the King by a general Law from God that  no human power could diminish or enlarge and as his last shift would obliquely put all into the power of the King by giving him a right of interpreting the Law and judging such cases as are not clearly decided which would be equally impertinent if he had openly and plainly a right of determining all things according to his will  But what defect soever may be in any Statutes no great inconveniencys could probably ensue if that for annual Parliaments was observ'd as of right it ought to be Nothing is more unlikely than that a great Assembly of eminent and chosen men should make a Law evidently destructive to their own designs and no mischief that might emerge upon the discovery of a mistake could be so extreme that the cure might not be defer'd till the meeting of the Parliament or at least forty days in which time the King may call one if that which the Law has fix'd seem to be too long If he fails of this he performs not his trust and he that would reward such a breach of it with a vast and uncontrolable power may be justly thought equal in madness to our Author who by forbidding us to examin the titles of Kings and enjoining an intire veneration of the power by what means soever obtain'd encourages the worst of men to murder the best of Princes with an assurance that if they prosper they shall enjoy all the honors and advantages that this World can afford  Princes are not much more beholden to him for the haughty language he puts into their mouths it having bin observ'd that the worst are always most ready to use it and their extravagances having bin often chastis'd by Law sufficiently proves that their power is not deriv'd from a higher original than the Law of their own Countrys  If it were true that the answer sometimes given by Kings to Bills presented for their Assent did as our Author says amount to a denial it could only shew that they have a negative voice upon that which is agreed by the Parliament and is far from a power of acting by themselves being only a check upon the other parts of the Government But indeed it is no more than an elusion and he that dos by art obliquely elude confesses he has not a right absolutely to refuse 'Tis natural to Kings especially to the worst to scrue up their Authority to the height and nothing can more evidently prove the defect of it than the necessity of having recourse to such pitiful evasions when they are unwilling to do that which is requir'd But if I should grant that the words import a denial and that notwithstanding those of the Coronation Oath  Quas vulgus elegerit  they might deny no more could be infer'd from thence than that they are entrusted with a power equal in that point to that of either House and cannot be supreme in our Author's sense unless there were in the same State at the same time three distinct supreme and absolute Powers which is absurd  His cases relating to the proceedings of the Star Chamber and CouncilTable do only prove that some Kings have incroach'd upon the rights of the Nation and bin suffer'd till their excesses growing to be extreme they turn'd to the ruin of the Ministers that advis'd them and sometimes of the Kings themselves But the Jurisdiction of the Council having bin regulated by the Statute of  Car  and the StarChamber more lately abolish'd they are nothing to our dispute  Such as our Author usually impute to Treason and Rebellion the changes that upon these occasions have ensu'd but all impartial men do not only justify them but acknowledg that all the Crowns of  Europe  are at this day enjoy'd by no other title than such Acts solemnly perform'd by the respective  Nations who either disliking the Person that pretended to the Crown tho next in blood or the Government of the present Possessor have thought fit to prefer another Person or Family They also say as that no Government can be so perfect but some defect may be originally in it or afterwards introduc'd none can subsist unless they be from time to time reduc'd to their first integrity by such an exertion of the power of those for whose sake they were instituted as may plainly shew them to be subject to no power under Heaven but may do whatever appears to be for their own good And as the safety of all Nations consists in rightly placing and measuring this Power such have bin found always to prosper who have given it to those from whom Usurpations were least to be fear'd who have bin least subject to be aw'd cheated or corrupted and who having the greatest interest in the Nation were most concern'd to preserve its power liberty and welfare This is the greatest trust that can be repos'd in men This power was by the  Spartans  given to the  Ephori  and the Senat of twenty eight in  Venine  to that which they call  Concilio de Pregadi  in  Germany Spain France Swedeland Denmark Poland Hungary Bohemia Scotland England  and generally all the Nations that have liv'd under the  Gothick  Polity it has bin in their General Assemblys under the names of Diets Cortez Parliaments Senats and the like But in what hands soever it is the power of making abrogating changing correcting and intepreting Laws has bin in the same Kings have bin rejected or depos'd the Succession of the Crown settled regulated or chang'd and I defy any man to shew me one King amongst all the Nations abovemention'd that has any right to the Crown he wears unless such acts are good  If this power be not well plac'd or rightly proportion'd to that which is given to other Magistrats the State must necessarily fall into great disorders or the must violent and dangerous means must be frequently us'd to preserve their Liberty  Sparta  and  Venice  have rarely bin put to that trouble because the Senats were so much above the Kings and Dukes in power that they could without difficulty bring them to reason The  Gothick  Kings in  Spain  never ventur'd to dispute with the Nobility and  Witza  and  Rodrigo  expos'd the Kingdom as a prey to the  Moors  rather by weakning it thro the neglect of Military disciplin join'd to their own ignorance and cowardice and by evil example bringing the youth to resemble them in leudness and baseness than by establishing in themselves a power above the Law But in  England  our Ancestors who seem to have had some such thing in their eye as balancing the powers by a fatal mistake plac'd usually so much in the hands of the King that whensoever he happen'd to be bad his extravagances could not be represt without great danger And as this has in several ages cost the Nation a vast proportion of generous blood so 'tis the cause of our present difficultys and threatens us with more but can never deprive usof the rights we inherit from our fathers  SECT XXVIII The English Nation has always bin govern'd by it self or its Representatives  HAVING prov'd that the People of  England  have never acknowledg'd any other human Law than their own and that our Parliaments having the power of making and abrogating Laws they only can  interpret them and decide hard cases it plainly appears there can be no truth in our Author's assertion That  the King is the Author Corrector and Moderator of both Statute and Common Law  and nothing can be more frivolous than what he adds that  neither of them can be a diminution of that natural power which Kings have over their People as fathers  in as much as the differences between paternal and monarchical Power as he asserts it are vast and irreconcilable in principle and practice as I have prov'd at large in the former parts of this Work  But lest we should be too proud of the honor he is pleas'd to do to our Parliaments by making use of their Authority he says  We are first to remember that till the Conquest  which name for the glory of our Nation he gives to the coming in of the  Normans there could be no Parliament assembled of the General States because we cannot learn that until those days it was intirely united in one  Secondly he doubts  Whether the Parliament in the time of the  Saxons  were compos'd of the Nobility and Clergy or whether the Commons were also call'd  but concludes  there could be no Knights of any Shires because there were no Shires  Thirdly  That  Henry  the First caus'd the Commons first to assemble Knights and Burgesses of their own chusing  and would make this to be an Act of grace and favor from that King but adds that  it had bin more for the honor of Parliaments if a King whose title to the Crown had bin better had bin the Author of the form of it  In answer to the first I do not think my self oblig'd to insist upon the name or form of the Parliament for the Authority of a Magistracy proceeds not from the number of years that it has continu'd but the rectitude of the Institution and the Authority of those that instituted it The power of  Saul David  and  Jeroboam  was the same with that which belong'd to the last Kings of  Israel  and  Judah  The Authority of the  Roman  Consuls Dictators Pretors and Tribuns was the same as soon as it was establish'd was as legal and just as that of the Kings of  Denmark  which is said to have continu'd above three thousand years For as time can make nothing lawful or just that is not so of it self tho men are unwilling to change that which has pleas'd their Ancestors unless they discover great inconveniences in it that which a People dos rightly establish for their own good is of as much force the first day as continuance can ever give to it and therefore in matters of the greatest importance wise and good men do not so much inquire what has bin as what is good and ought to be for that which of it self is evil by continuance is made worse and upon the first opportunity is justly to be abolish'd But if that Liberty in which God created man can receive any strength from continuance and the rights of  Englishmen  can be render'd more unquestionable by prescription I say that the Nations whose rights we inherit have ever enjoy'd the Libertys we claim and always exercis'd them in governing themselves popularly or by such Representatives as have bin instituted by themselves from the time they were first known in the World  The  Britans  and  Saxons  lay so long hid in the obscurity that accompanys barbarism that 'tis in vain to seek what was done by either in any Writers more antient than  Cesar  and  Tacitus  The first describes the  Britans  to have bin a fierce People zealous for Liberty and so obstinately valiant in the defence of it that tho they wanted skill and were overpower'd by the  Romans  their Country could no otherwise be subdu'd than by the slaughter of all the Inhabitants able to bear arms He calls them a free People in as much as they were not like the  Gauls  govern'd by Laws  made by the great Men but by the People In his time they chose  Cassivellaunus  and afterwards  Caractatus Arviragus Galgacus  and others to command them in their wars but they retain'd the Government in themselves That no force might be put upon them they met arm'd in their general Assemblys and tho the smaller matters were left to the determination of the Chief men chosen by themselves for that purpose they reserv'd the most important amongst which the chusing of those men was one to themselves When the  Romans  had brought them low  Inter instrumenta servitutis reges habuere  C Tacit  they set up certain Kings to govern such as were within their Territorys but those who defended themselves by the natural strength of their situation or retir'd into the North or the Islands were still govern'd by their own Customs and were never acquainted with domestick or foreign slavery▪ The  Saxons  from whom we chiefly derive our Original and Manners were no less lovers of Liberty and better understood the ways of defending it They were certainly the most powerful and valiant People of  Germany  and what the  Germans  perform'd under  Ariovistus Arminius  and  Maroboduus  shews both their force and their temper If ever fear enter'd into the heart of  Cesar  it seems to have bin when he was to deal with  Ariovistus  The advantages that the brave  Germanicus  obtain'd against  Arminius  were at least thought equal to the greatest Victorys that had bin gain'd by any  Roman  Captain because these Nations fought not for riches or any instruments of Luxury or Pleasure which they despis'd but for Liberty This was the Principle in which they liv'd as appears by their words and actions so that  Arminius  when his brother  Flavius  who serv'd the  Romans  boasted of the increase of his pay and the marks of honor he had receiv'd in scorn call'd them the  Vilis servi  ii pramia  Tacit  rewards of the vilest servitude  but when he himself endeavour'd to usurp a power over the Liberty of his Country which he had so bravely defended he was kill'd by those he would have opprest  Tacitus  farther describing the nature of the  Germans  shews that the  Romans  had run greater hazards from them than from the  Samnites Carthaginians  and  Parthians  and attributes their Bravery to the  Quippe gravior est Arsacis regno Germanorum Libertas  Liberty they enjoy'd for they are says he neither  Exe  pti oneribus collationibus tantum in usum pra  liorum seposi  i velut tela arma bellis reservantur  exhausted by Tributes nor vex'd by Publicans and lest this Liberty should be violated  De minoribus principes consultant de majoribus omnes  C Tac  de mor Germ  the chief men consult about things of lesser moment but the most important matters are determin'd by all  Whoever would know the opinion of that wise Author concerning the  German  Liberty may read his excellent Treatise of their Manners and Customs but I presume this may be enough to prove that they liv'd free under such Magistrats as they chose regulated by such Laws as they made and retain'd the principal powers of the Government in their general or particular Councils Their Kings and Princes had no other power than what was confer'd upon them by these  Ut turbae placuit considunt armati silentium per  acerdotes quibus tum coercendi jus est imperatur Mox Rex vel Princeps prout aetas cuique prout nobilitas prout decus bellorum prout facundia est audiuntur autoritate suadendi magis quam jubendi potestate Si displi  uit sententia▪ fremitu a  pernantur si placuit frameas concutiunt c  Ibid  Assemblys who having all in themselves could receive nothing from them who had nothing to give  'Tis as easily prov'd that the  Saxons  or  Angli  from whom we descend were eminent among those whose power vertue and love to Liberty the abovemention'd Historian so highly extols in as much as besides what he says in general of the  Saxons  he names the  Angli  describes their habitation near the  Elb  and their religious worship of the Goddess  Erthum  or the Earth celebrated in an Island lying in the mouth of that River thought to be  Heyligland  in resemblance of which a small one lying over against  Berwick  is call'd Holy Island If they were free in their own Country they must have bin so when they came hither The manner of their coming shews they were more likely to impose than submit to slavery and if they had not the name of Parliament it was because they did not speak  French  or not being yet join'd with the  Normans  they had not thought fit to put their Affairs into that method but having the root of Power and Liberty in themselves they could not but have a right of establishing the one in such a form as best pleas'd them for the preservation of the other  This being as I suppose undeniable it imports not whether the Assemblys in which the Supreme Power of each Nation did reside were frequent or rare compos'd of many or few Persons sitting altogether in one place or in more what name they had or whether every Free man did meet and vote in his own person or a few were delegated by many For they who have a Right inherent in themselves may resign it to others and they who can give a Power to others may exercise it themselves unless they recede from it by their own act for it is only matter of convenience of which they alone can be the Judges because 'tis for themselves only that they judg If this were not so it would be very prejudicial to Kings for 'tis certain that  Cassivellaunus Caractatus Arviragus Galgacus Hengist Horsa  and others amongst the  Britans  and  Saxons  what name soever may have bin abusively given to them were only temporary Magistrats chosen upon occasion of present Wars but we know of no time in which the  Britans  had not their Great Council to determin their most important Affairs and the  Saxons  in their own Country had their Councils where all were present and in which  Tacitus  assures us they dispatch'd their greatest Business These were the same with the  Micklegemots  which they afterwards held here and might have bin call'd by the same name if  Tacitus  had spoken  Dutch  If a People therefore have not a power to create at any time a Magistracy which they had not before none could be created at all for no Magistracy is eternal And if for the validity of the Constitution it be necessary that the beginning must be unknown or that no other could have bin before it the Monarchy amongst us cannot be establish'd upon any right for tho our Ancestors had their Councils and Magistrats as well here as in  Germany  they had no Monarchs This appears plainly by the testimony of  Cesar  and  Tacitus  and our later Historys show that as soon as the  Saxons  came into this Country they had their  Micklegemots  which were general Assemblys of the Noble and Free men who had in themselves the Power of the Nation and tho when they increas'd in numbers they erected seven Kingdoms yet every one retain'd the same usage within it self These Assemblys were evidently the same in power with our Parliaments and tho they differ'd in name or form it matters not for they who could act in the one could not but have a power of instituting the other that is the same People that could meet together in their own Persons and according to their  own pleasure order all matters relating to themselves whilst three or four Countys only were under one Government and their numbers were not so great or their habitation so far distant that they might not meet altogether without inconvenience with the same Right might depute others to represent them when being join'd in one no place was capable of receiving so great a multitude and that the Frontiers would have bin expos'd to the danger of foreign Invasions if any such thing had bin practis'd  But if the Authority of Parliaments for many Ages representing the whole Nation were less to be valu'd as our Author insinuates because they could not represent the whole when it was not join'd in one Body that of Kings must come to nothing for there could be no one King over all when the Nation was divided into seven distinct Governments And 'tis most absurd to think that the Nation which had seven Great Councils or Micklegemots at the same time they had seven Kingdoms could not as well unite the seven Councils as the seven Kingdoms into one 'Tis to as little purpose to say that the Nation did not unite it self but the several parcels came to be inherited by one for that one could inherit no more from the others than what they had and the seven being only Magistrats set up by the Micklegemots c the one must be also And 'tis neither reasonable to imagin nor possible to prove that a fierce Nation jealous of Liberty and who had obstinately defended it in  Germany  against all Invaders should conquer this Country to enslave themselves and purchase nothing by their Valor but that Servitude which they abhor'd or be less free when they were united into one State than they had bin when they were divided into seven and least of all that one man could first subdue his own People and then all the rest when by endeavouring to subdue his own he had broken the Trust repos'd in him and lost the Right confer'd upon him and without them had not power to subdue any But as it is my fate almost ever to dissent from our Author I affirm That the variety of Government which is observ'd to have bin amongst the  Saxons  who in some Ages were divided in others united sometimes under Captains at other times under Kings sometimes meeting personally in the Micklegemots sometimes by their Delegats in the Wittenagemots dos evidently testify that they order'd all things according to their own pleasure which being the utmost Act of Liberty it remain'd inviolable under all those changes as we have already prov'd by the Examples of  Offa Ina Alfred Canutus Edward  and other particular as well as universal Kings And we may be sure those of the  Norman  Race can have no more power since they came in by the same way and swore to govern by the same Laws  I am no way concern'd in our Author's doubt  Whether Parliaments did in those days consist of Nobility and Clergy or Whether the Commons were also call'd  For if it were true as he asserts that according to the eternal Law of God and Nature there can be no Government in the World but that of an absolute Monarch whose Sovereign Majesty can be diminish'd by no Law or Custom there could be Parliaments or other Magistracys that did not derive their Power and Being from his Will But having prov'd that the  Saxons  had their General Councils and Assemblys when they had no Kings that by them Kings were made and the greatest Affairs determin'd whether they had Kings or not it can be of no importance whether in one or more Ages the Commons had a part in the Government or not For the same  Power that instituted a Parliament without them might when they thought fit receive them into it or rather if they who had the Government in their hands did for reasons known to themselves recede from the exercise of it they might resume it when they pleas'd  Nevertheless it may be worth our pains to inquire what our Author means by Nobility If such as at this day by means of Patents obtain'd for mony or by favor without any regard to Merit in the Persons or their Ancestors are call'd Dukes Marquesses c I give him leave to impute as late and base an Original to them as he pleases without fearing that the Rights of our Nation can thereby be impair'd and am content that if the King do not think fit to support the Dignity of his own Creatures they may fall But if by Noblemen we are to understand such as have bin ennobl'd by the vertues of their Ancestors manifested in Services done to their Country I say that all Nations amongst whom Vertue has bin esteem'd have had a great regard to them and their Posterity and tho Kings when they were made have bin entrusted by the  Saxons  and other Nations with a Power of ennobling those who by Services render'd to their Country might deserve that Honor yet the Body of the Nobility was more antient than such for it had bin equally impossible  to take  Reges ex nobilitate duces ex virtute sumere  Sublimato eo coepit lues omnium scelerum crescere s  viebat scurrilis nequitia odium veritatis c ut vas omnium scelerum solus videretur Vortigernus quod maxime Regiae honestati contrarium est Nobiles deprimens moribus sanguine ignobiles extollens Deo hominibus e    icitur odiosus  Mat Westm  An  Kings  according to  Tacitus out of the Nobility  if there had bin no Nobility as  to take Captains for their Vertue  if there had bin no Vertue Princes could not without breach of Trust confer Honors upon those that did not deserve them which is so true that this practice was objected as the greatest crime against †  Vortigern  the last and the worst of the  British  Kings and tho he might pretend according to such cavils as are usually in our time that the judgment of those matters was refer'd to him yet the World judg'd of his Crimes and when he had render'd himself odious to God and Men by them he perish'd in them and brought destruction upon his Country that had suffer'd them too long  As among the  Turks  and most of the Eastern Tyrannys there is no Nobility and no man has any considerable advantage above the common People unless by the immediate favor of the Prince so in all the legal Kingdoms of the North the strength of the Government has always bin plac'd in the Nobility and no better defence has bin found against the encroachments of ill Kings than by setting up an Order of Men who by holding large Territorys and having great numbers of Tenants and Dependents might be able to restrain the exorbitances that either the Kings or the Commons might run into For this end  Spain Germany France Poland Denmark Sweden Scotland  and  England  were almost wholly divided into Lordships under several names by which every particular Possessor ow'd Allegiance that is such an Obedience as the Law requires to the King and he reciprocally swore to perform that which the same Law exacted from him  When these Nations were converted to the Christian Religion they had a great veneration for the Clergy and not doubting that the Men  whom they esteem'd holy would be just thought their Libertys could not be better secur'd than by joining those who had the direction of their Consciences to the Noblemen who had the command of their Forces This succeeded so well in relation to the defence of the publick Rights that in all the foremention'd States the Bishops Abbots c were no less zealous or bold in defending the publick Liberty than the best and greatest of the Lords And if it were true that things being thus establish'd the Commons did neither personally nor by their Representatives enter into the General Assemblys it could be of no advantage to Kings for such a Power as is abovemention'd is equally inconsistent with the absolute Sovereignty of Kings if plac'd in the Nobility and Clergy as if the Commons had a part If the King has all no other Man nor number of Men can have any If the Nobility and Clergy have the power the Commons may have their share also But I affirm that those whom we now call Commons have always had a part in the Government and their place in the Councils that manag'd it for if there was a distinction it must have bin by Patent Birth or Tenure  As for Patents we know they began long after the coming of the  Normans  and those that now have them cannot pretend to any advantage on account of Birth or Tenure beyond many of those who have them not Nay besides the several Branches of the Familys that now enjoy the most antient Honors which consequently are as noble as they and some of them of the elder Houses we know many that are now call'd Commoners who in antiquity and eminency are no way inferior to the chief of the titular Nobility and nothing can be more absurd than to give a Prerogative of Birth to  Crvn Tftn Hde Bnnt Osbrn  and others before the  Cliftons Hampdens Courtneys Pelhams St Johns Baintons Wilbrahams Hungerfords  and many others And if the Tenures of their Estates be consider'd they have the same and as antient as any of those who go under the names of Duke or Marquess I forbear to mention the sordid ways of attaining to Titles in our days but whoever will take the pains to examin them shall find that they rather defile than ennoble the possessors And whereas Men are truly ennobl'd only by Vertue and respect is due to such as are descended from those who have bravely serv'd their Country because it is presum'd till they shew the contrary that they will resemble their Ancestors these modern Courtiers by their Names and Titles frequently oblige us to call to mind such things as are not to be mention'd without blushing Whatever the antient Noblemen of  England  were we are sure they were not such as these And tho it should be confest that no others than Dukes Marquesses Earls Viscounts and Barons had their places in the Councils mention'd by  Cesar  and  Tacitus  or in the great Assemblys of the  Saxons  it could be of no advantage to such as are now call'd by those names They were the titles of Offices confer'd upon those who did and could best conduct the People in time of War give Counsel to the King administer Justice and perform other publick dutys but were never made hereditary except by abuse much less were they sold for mony or given as recompences of the vilest services If the antient Order be totally inverted and the ends of its Institution perverted they who from thence pretend to be distinguish'd from other men must build their Claim upon something very different from Antiquity  This being sufficient if I mistake not to make it appear That the antient Councils of our Nation did not consist of such as we now call Noblemen it may be worth our pains to examin of what sort of men they  did consist And tho I cannot much rely upon the credit of  Camden  which he has forfeited by a great number of untruths I will begin with him because he is cited by our Author If we will believe him  Quod Saxones olim Wittenagemot Parliamentum Pananglicum recte dici possit summam{que}  acrosanctam habet autoritatem in legibus ferendis antiquandis conformandis interpretandis in omnibus quae ad Reipublicae salutem spectant  Brit  fol  That which the  Saxons  call'd Wittenagemot we may justly name Parliament which has the supreme and most sacred Authority of making abrogating and interpreting Laws and generally of all things relating to the safety of the Commonwealth  This Wittenagemot was according to  William  of  Malmsbury  Generalis Senatus populi Conventus  Malms  The general meeting of the Senat and People  and Sir  Harry Spelman  calls it  Commune Concilium tam Cleri quam Populi  Spelm  The General Council of the Clergy and People  In the Assembly at  Calcuth  it was decreed by the Archbishops Bishops Abbots Dukes Senators and the People of the Land  Populo terrae  that  the  Ut Reges à Sacerdotibus senioribus Populi eligantur  Kings should be elected by the Priests and Elders of the People  By these  Offa Ina  and others were made Kings and  Alfred  in his Will acknowledg'd his  Quam Dens Principes cum senioribus Populi misericorditer benigne dederunt  Crown from them  Edgar  was elected by all the People and not long after depos'd by them and again restor'd in a  Coram omni multitudine populi Anglorum  General Assembly These things being sometimes said to be done by the assent of the Barons of the Kingdom  Camden  says That  under the name of the  Nomine Baronagii omnes quodam modo regni ord  nes continentur  Camd  Baronage all the Orders of the Kingdom are in a manner comprehended  and it cannot be otherwise understood if we consider that those call'd Noblemen or the Nobility of  England  are often by the Historians said to be  infinita multitudo  an infinite multitude  If any man ask how the Nobility came to be so numerous I answer That the Northern Nations who were perpetually in Arms put a high esteem upon Military Valor sought by conquest to acquire better Countrys than their own valu'd themselves according to the numbers of men they could bring into the field and to distinguish them from Villains call'd those Noblemen who nobly defended and enlarg'd their Dominions by War and for a reward of their Services in the division of Lands gain'd by conquest they distributed to them Freeholds under the obligation of continuing the same Service to their Country This appears by the name of Knights Service a Knight being no more than a Soldier and a Knight's Fee no more than was sufficient to maintain one 'Tis plain that Knighthood was always esteem'd Nobility so that no man of what quality soever thought a Knight inferior to him and those of the highest birth could not act as Noblemen till they were knighted Among the  Goths  in  Spain  the cutting off the Hair which being long was the mark of Knighthood was accounted a degrading and look'd upon to be so great a mark of Infamy that he who had suffer'd it could never bear any honor or office in the Commonwealth and there was no dignity so high but every Knight was capable of it There was no distinction of men above it and even to this day  Baron  or  Varon  in their Language signifys no more than  Vir  in Latin which is not properly given to any man unless he be free The like was in  France  till the coming in of the third race of Kings in which time the Peers of whom only were Laymen were rais'd to a higher dignity and the Commands annex'd made hereditary but  the honor of Knighthood was thereby no way diminish'd Tho there were Dukes Earls Marquesses and Barons in the time of  Froissart  yet he usually calls them Knights And  Philip de Commines  speaking of the most eminent men of his time calls them good wise or valiant Knights Even to this day the name of Gentleman comprehends all that is rais'd above the common people  Henry  the Fourth usually call'd himself the first Gentleman in  France  and 'tis an ordinary phrase among them when they speak of a Gentleman of good Birth to say  Il est noble comme le Roy He is as noble as the King  In their General Assembly of Estates  The Chamber of the Noblesse  which is one of Three is compos'd of the Deputys sent by the Gentry of every Province and in the inquiry made about the Year concerning Nobility no notice was taken of such as had assum'd the Titles of Earl Marquess Viscount or Baron but only of those who call'd themselves Gentlemen and if they could prove that name to belong to them they were left to use the other Titles as they pleas'd When Duels were in fashion as all know they were lately no man except the Princes of the Blood and Marechals of  France  could with honor refuse a Challenge from any Gentleman The first because it was thought unfit that he who might be King should fight with a Subject to the danger of the Commonwealth which might by that means be depriv'd of its Head The others being by their Office Commanders of the Nobility and Judges of all the Controversys relating to Honor that happen amongst them cannot reasonably be brought into private Contests with any In  Denmark Nobleman  and  Gentleman  is the same thing and till the year they had the principal part of the Government in their hands When  Charles Gustavus  King of  Sweden  invaded  Poland  in the year 'tis said that there were above three hundred thousand Gentlemen in Arms to resist him This is the Nobility of that Country Kings are chosen by them Every one of them will say as in  France He is noble as the King  The last King was a private man among them not thought to have had more than four hundred pounds a year He who now reigns was not at all above him in birth or estate till he had rais'd himself by great services done for his Country in many wars and there was not one Gentleman in the Nation who might not have bin chosen as well as he if it had pleas'd the Assembly that did it  This being the Nobility of the Northern Nations and the true Baronage of  England  'tis no wonder that they were call'd  Nobiles  the most eminent among them  Magnates Principes Proceres  and so numerous that they were esteem'd to be  Multitudo infinita  One place was hardly able to contain them and the inconveniences of calling them all together appear'd to be so great that in time they chose rather to meet by Representatives than every one in his own person The power therefore remaining in them it matters not what method they observ'd in the execution They who had the substance in their hands might give it what form they pleas'd Our Author sufficiently manifests his ignorance in saying there could be no Knights of the Shires in the time of the  Saxons  because there were no Shires for the very word is  Saxon  and we find the names of  Barkshire Wiltshire Devonshire Dorsetshire  and others most frequently in the writings of those times and Dukes Earls Thanes or Aldermen appointed to command the Forces and look to the distribution of Justice in them  Selden  cites  Ingulphus  for saying that  Selden  's Tit of Honor  p c  Alfred was the first that chang'd the Provinces c into Countys  but refutes him and proves that the distinction of the Land into Shires or  Countys for Shire signify'd no more than the share or part committed to the care of the Earl or  Comes  was far more antient Whether the first divisions by the  Saxons  were greater or lesser than the Shires or Countys now are is nothing to the question they who made them to be as they were could have made them greater or lesser as they pleas'd And whether they did immediately or some ages after that distinction cease to come to their great Assemblys and rather chuse to send their Deputys or whether such Deputys were chosen by Countys Citys and Boroughs as in our days or in any other manner can be of no advantage or prejudice to the Cause that I maintain If the power of the Nation when it was divided into seven Kingdoms or united under one did reside in the Micklegemots or Wittenagemots if these consisted of the Nobility and People who were sometimes so numerous that no one place could well contain them and if the preference given to the chief among them was on account of the Offices they executed either in relation to war or justice which no man can deny I have as much as serves for my purpose 'Tis indifferent to me whether they were call'd Earls Dukes Aldermen Herotoghs or Thanes for 'tis certain that the titular Nobility now in mode amongst us has no resemblance to this antient Nobility of  England  The novelty therefore is on the other side and that of the worst sort because by giving the name of Noblemen which antiently belong'd to such as had the greatest interests in Nations and were the supporters of their Liberty to Courtcreatures who often have none and either acquire their Honors by mony or are prefer'd for servile and sometimes impure services render'd to the Person that reigns or else for mischiefs done to their Country the Constitution has bin wholly inverted and the trust repos'd in the Kings who in some measure had the disposal of Offices and Honors misemploy'd This is farther aggravated by appropriating the name of Noblemen solely to them whereas the Nation having bin antiently divided only into Freemen or Noblemen who were the same and Villains the first were as  Tacitus  says of their Ancestors the  Germans  Exempti oneribus collationibus tantum in usum praliorum repositi v  luti tela arma  llis reservantur  Corn Tacit  de morib Germ  exempted from burdens and contributions and reserv'd like arms for the uses of war  whilst the others were little better than slaves appointed to cultivate the Lands or to other servile Offices And I leave any reasonable man to judg whether the latter condition be that of those we now call Commoners Nevertheless he that will believe the title of Noblemen still to belong to those only who are so by Patent may guess how well our wars would be manag'd if they were left solely to such as are so by that title If this be approv'd his Majesty may do well with his hundred and fifty Noblemen eminent in valor and military experience as they are known to be to make such wars as may fall upon him and leave the despis'd Commons under the name of Villains to provide for themselves if the success do not answer his expectations But if the Commons are as free as the Nobles many of them in birth equal to the Patentees in Estate superior to most of them and that it is not only expected they should assist him in wars with their Persons and Purses but acknowledg'd by all that the strength and vertue of the Nation is in them it must be confest that they are true Noblemen of  England  and that all the privileges antiently enjoy'd by such must necessarily belong to them since they perform the Offices to which they were  annex'd This shews how the Nobility were justly said to be almost infinite in number so that no one place was able to contain them The  Saxon  Armys that came over into this Country to a wholesom and generative climat might well increase in four or five ages to those vast numbers as the  Franks Goths  and others had done in  Spain France Italy  and other parts and when they were grown so numerous they found themselves necessarily oblig'd to put the power into the hands of Representatives chosen by themselves which they had before exercis'd in their own persons But these two ways differing rather in form than essentially the one tending to Democracy the other to Aristocracy they are equally opposite to the absolute dominion of one man reigning for himself and governing the Nation as his Patrimony and equally assert the rights of the People to put the Government into such a form as best pleases themselves This was sutable to what they had practis'd in their own Country  De minoribus consultant Principes de majoribus omnes  Nay even  Tacit de mor▪ Germ  these  smaller matters  cannot be said properly to relate to the King for he is but one and the word  Principes  is in the plural number and can only signify such principal men as the same Author says were chosen by the General Assemblys to do justice c and to each of them one hundred  Comites  join'd not only to give advice but authority to their actions  The word  Omnes  spoken by a  Roman  must likewise be understood as it was us'd by them and imports all the Citizens or such as made up the body of the Commonwealth If he had spoken of  Rome  or  Athens  whilst they remain'd free he must have us'd the same word because all those of whom the City consisted had votes how great soever the number of slaves or strangers might have bin The  Spartans  are rightly said to have gain'd lost and recover'd the Lordship or Principality of  Greece  They were all Lords in relation to their  Helots  and so were the  Dorians  in relation to that sort of men which under several names they kept as the  Saxons  did their Villains for the performance of the Offices which they thought too mean for those who were ennobl'd by Liberty and the use of Arms by which the Commonwealth was defended and enlarg'd Tho the  Romans  scorn'd to give the title of Lord to those who had usurp'd a power over their Lives and Fortunes yet every one of them was a Lord in relation to his own Servants and altogether are often call'd  Romanos rerum Dominos  Virg  Lords of the world  the like is seen almost every where The Government of  Venice  having continu'd for many ages in the same Familys has ennobl'd them all No phrase is more common in  Switzerland  than  the Lords of Bern  or  the Lords of Zurich  and other places tho perhaps there is not a man amongst them who pretends to be a Gentleman according to the modern sense put upon that word The States of the United Provinces are call'd High and Mighty Lords and the same title is given to each of them in particular Nay the word  Heer  which signifys Lord both in high and low  Dutch  is as common as Monsieur in  France  Signor in  Italy  or Sennor in  Spain  and is given to every one who is not of a sordid condition but especially to Soldiers and tho a common Soldier be now a much meaner thing than it was antiently no man speaking to a company of Soldiers in  Italian  uses any other stile than  Signori Soldati  and the like is done in other Languages 'Tis not therefore to be thought strange if the  Saxons  who in their own Country had scorn'd any other employment than that of the Sword should think themselves farther ennobl'd  when by their Arms they had acquir'd a great and rich Country and driven out or subdu'd the former inhabitants They might well distinguish themselves from the Villains they brought with them or the  Britans  they had enslav'd They might well be call'd  Magnates Proceres regni Nobiles Angliae Nobilitas Barones  and the Assemblys of them justly call'd  Concilium Regni Generale Ʋniversitas totius Angliae Nobilium Ʋniversitas Baronagii  according to the variety of times and other occurrences We have such footsteps remaining of the name of Baron as plainly shew the signification of it The Barons of  London  and the Cinq Ports are known to be only the Freemen of those places In the petty Court▪Barons every man who may be of a Jury is a Baron These are Noblemen for there are noble Nations as well as noble men in Nations The  Mammalukes  accounted themselves to be all noble tho born slaves and when they had ennobl'd themselves by the use of Arms they look'd upon the noblest of the  Egyptians  as their slaves  Tertullian  writing not to some eminent men but to the whole People of  Carthage  calls them  Antiquitate Nobiles Nobilitate felices  Such were the  Saxons  ennobl'd by a perpetual application to those exercises that belong to Noblemen and an abhorrence to any thing that is vile and sordid  Lest this should seem far fetch'd to those who please themselves with cavilling they are to know that the same General Councils are exprest by other Authors in other words They are call'd  Commune Concilium Episcoporum Procerum Comitum omnium Sapientum Seniorum Populorum totius regni  Bed Eccl Hist  The General Council of the Bishops Noblemen Counts all the wise men Elders and People of the whole Kingdom  in the time of  Ina  In that  Edward  the elder  Magnum Concilium Episcoporum Abbatum Fidelium Procerum Populorum  The Great Council of the Bishops Abbots Noblemen and People William  of  Malmsbury  calls them  Senatum generalem populi conventum  The General Senat and Assembly of the People  Sometimes they are in short call'd  Clergy and People  but all express the same power neither receiv'd from nor li  itable by Kings who are always said to be chosen or made and sometimes depos'd by them  William  the  Norman  found and left the Nation in this condition  Henry  the second  John  and  Henry  the third who had nothing but what was confer'd upon them by the same Clergy and People did so too  Magna Charta  could give nothing to the People who in themselves had all and only reduc'd into a small Volume the Rights which the Nation was resolv'd to maintain brought the King to confess they were perpetually inherent and time out of mind enjoy'd and to swear that he would no way violate them if he did he was  ipso facto  excommunicated and being thereby declar'd to be an execrable perjur'd Person they knew how to deal with him This Act has bin confirm'd by thirty Parliaments and the proceedings with Kings who have violated their Oaths as well before as after the time of  Henry  the third which have bin already mention'd are sufficient to shew that  England  has always bin govern'd by it self and never acknowledg'd any other Lord than such as they thought fit to set up  SECT XXIX The King was never Master of the Soil  THOSE who without regard to truth resolve to insist upon such points as they think may serve their designs when they find it cannot be deny'd that the powers before mention'd have bin exercis'd by the  English  and other Nations say that they were the concessions of Kings who being masters of the Soil might bestow parcels upon some Persons with such conditions as they pleas'd retaining to themselves the supreme dominion of the whole and having already as they think made them the Fountains of Honor they proceed to make them also the Fountains of Property and for proof of this alledg that all Lands tho held of mean Lords do by their Tenures at last result upon the King as the Head from whom they are enjoy'd This might be of force if it were true but matters of the highest importance requiring a most evident proof we are to examin First if it be possible and in the next place if it be true  For the first No man can give what he has not Whoever therefore will pretend that the King has bestow'd this propriety must prove that he had it in himself I confess that the Kings of  Spain  and  Portugal  obtain'd from the Pope grants of the Territorys they possest in the  WestIndys  and this might be of some strength if the Pope as Vicar of Christ had an absolute dominion over the whole earth but if that fail the whole falls to the ground and he is ridiculously liberal of that which no way belongs to him My business is not to dispute that point but before it can have any influence upon our Affairs our Kings are to prove that they are Lords of  England  upon the same Title or some other equivalent to it When that is done we shall know upon whom they have a dependence and may at leisure consider whether we ought to acknowledg and submit to such a Power or give reasons for our resusal But there being no such thing in our present case their property must be grounded upon something else or we may justly conclude they have none  In order to this 'tis hardly worth the pains to search into the obscure remains of the  British  Historys For when the  Romans  deserted our Island they did not confer the right they had whether more or less upon any man but left the enjoyment of it to the poor remainders of the Nation and their own establish'd Colonys who were grown to be one People with the Natives The  Saxons  came under the conduct of  Hengist  and  Horsa  who seem to have bin sturdy Pirats but did not that I can learn bear any Characters in their persons of the so much admir'd Sovereign Majesty that should give them an absolute dominion or propriety either in their own Country or any other they should set their feet upon They came with about a hundred men and chusing rather  Mat West Flor Hist  to serve  Vortigern  than to depend upon what they could get by rapine at Sea liv'd upon a small proportion of Land by him allotted to them Tho this seems to be but a slender encouragement yet it was enough to invite many others to follow their Example and Fortune so that their  number increasing the County of  Kent  was given to them under the obligation of serving the  Britans  in their Wars Not long after Lands in  Northumberland  were bestow'd upon another company of them with the same condition This was all the Title they had to what they enjoy'd till they treacherously kill'd four hundred and sixty or as  William  of  Ibid  Malmsbury  says three hundred principal men of the Nobility and made  Vortigern  Prisoner who had bin so much their Benefactor that he seems never to have deserv'd well but from them and to have incens'd the  Britans  by the favor he shew'd them as much as by the worst of his Vices And certainly actions of this kind compos'd of falshood and cruelty can never create a right in the opinion of any better men than  Filmer  and his Disciples who think that the power only is to be regarded and not the means by which it is obtain'd But tho it should be granted that a right had bin thus acquir'd it must accrue to the Nation not to  Hengist  and  Horsa  If such an acquisition be call'd a Conquest the benefit must belong to those that conquer'd This was not the work of two men and those who had bin free at home can never be thought to have left their own Country to fight as slaves for the glory and profit of two men in another It cannot be said that their wants compel'd them for their Leaders suffer'd the same and could not be reliev'd but by their assistance and whether their enterprize was good or bad just or unjust it was the same to all No one man could have any right peculiar to himself unless they who gain'd it did confer it upon him and 'tis no way probable that they who in their own Country had kept their Princes within very narrow limits as has bin prov'd should resign themselves and all they had as soon as they came hither But we have already shewn that they always continu'd most obstinate defenders of their Liberty and the Government to which they had bin accustom'd that they manag'd it by themselves and acknowledg'd no other Laws than their own Nay if they had made such a resignation of their Right as was necessary to create one in their Leaders it would be enough to overthrow the proposition for 'tis not then the Leader that gives to the People but the People to the Leader If the people had not a right to give what they did give none was confer'd upon the receiver if they had a right he that should pretend to derive a benefit from thence must prove the grant that the nature and intention of it may appear  To the second If it be said that Records testify all Grants to have bin originally from the King I answer That tho it were confest which I absolutely deny and affirm that our Rights and Libertys are innate inherent and enjoy'd time out of mind before we had Kings it could be nothing to the question which is concerning Reason and Justice and if they are wanting the defect can never be supply'd by any matter of fact tho never so clearly prov'd Or if a Right be pretended to be grounded upon a matter of fact the thing to be prov'd is that the people did really confer such a right upon the first or some other Kings And if no such thing do appear the proceedings of one or more Kings as if they had it can be of no value But in the present case no such grant is pretended to have bin made either to the first or to any of the following Kings the Right they had not their Successors could not inherit and consequently cannot have it or at most no better title to it than that of Usurpation  But as they who inquire for truth ought not to deny or conceal any thing I may grant that Mannors c were enjoy'd by tenure from Kings but that will no way prejudice the cause I defend nor signify more than that the Countrys which the  Saxons  had acquir'd were to be divided among them and to avoid the quarrels that might arise if every man took upon him to seize what he could a certain method of making the distribution was necessarily to be fix'd and it was fit that every man should have something in his own hands to justify his Title to what he possest according to which controversys should be determin'd This must be testify'd by some body and no man could be so fit or of so much credit as he who was chief among them and this is no more than is usual in all the Societys of the World The Mayor of every Corporation the Speaker or Clerk of the House of Peers or House of Commons the first President of every Parliament or Presidial in  France  the Consul Burgermaster Advoyer or Bailiff in every free Town of  Holland Germany  or  Switzerland  sign the publick Acts that pass in those places The Dukes of  Venice  and  Genoa  do the like tho they have no other power than what is confer'd upon them and of themselves can do little or nothing The Grants of our Kings are of the same nature tho the words  mero motu nostro  seem to imply the contrary for Kings speak always in the plural number to shew that they do not act for themselves but for the Societys over which they are plac'd and all the veneration that is or can be given to their Acts dos not exalt them but those from whom their Authority is deriv'd and for whom they are to execute The Tyrants of the East and other Barbarians whose power is most absolute speak in the single number as appears by the decrees of  Nabuchodonosor Cyrus Darius  and  Ahasuerus  recited in Scripture with others that we hear of daily from those parts but wheresoever there is any thing of civility or regularity in Government the Prince uses the plural to shew that he acts in a publick capacity From hence says  Grotius  the rights of Kings to send Embassadors make Leagues c do arise the confederacys made by them do not terminate with their lives because they are not for themselves they speak not in their own Persons but as representing their People and  Rex regno exutus jus legandi amittit  Grot de Jur Bell  a King who is depriv'd of his Kingdom loses the right of sending Embassadors  because he can no longer speak for those who by their own consent or by a foreign force are cut off from him The question is not whether such a one be justly or unjustly depriv'd for that concerns only those who do it or suffer it but whether he can oblige the People and 'tis ridiculous for any Nation to treat with a man that cannot perform what shall be agreed or for him to stipulate that which can oblige and will be made good only by himself  But tho much may be left to the discretion of Kings in the distribution of Lands and the like yet it no way diminishes the right of the People nor confers any upon them otherwise to dispose of what belongs to the publick than may tend to the common good and the accomplishment of those ends for which they are intrusted Nay if it were true that a conquer'd Country did belong to the Crown the King could not dispose of it because 'tis annex'd to the Office add not alienable by the Person This is not only found in regular mix'd Monarchys as in  Sweden  where the Grants made by the last Kings have bin lately rescinded by the General Assembly of Estates as contrary to Law but even in the most absolute  as in  France  where the present King who has stretch'd his power to the utmost has lately acknowledg'd that he cannot do it and according to the known maxim of the State that the demeasnes of the Crown which are design'd for the defraying of publick Charges cannot be alienated all the Grants made within the last fifteen years have bin annul'd even those who had bought Lands of the Crown have bin call'd to account and the Sums given being compar'd with the profits receiv'd and a moderate interest allow'd to the purchasers so much of the principal as remain'd due to them has bin repay'd and the Lands resum'd  SECT XXX  Henry  the First was King of  England  by as good a Title as any of his Predecessors or Successors  HAVING made it appear as I suppose that the antient Nobility of  England  was compos'd of such men as had bin ennobl'd by bearing Arms in the defence or enlargement of the Commonwealth that the Dukes Earls c were those who commanded them that they and their dependents receiv'd Lands for such services under an obligation of continuing to render the like and according to their several degrees and proportions to provide and maintain Horses Arms and Men for the same uses it cannot be deny'd that they were such Gentlemen and Lords of Mannors as we now call Commoners together with the Freeholders and such as in war were found most able to be their Leaders Of these the Micklegemots Wittenagemots and other publick Assemblys did consist and nothing can be more absurd than to assign the names and rights of Duke Earl and Vicount which were names of Offices to those who have not the Offices and are no way fit for them If our Author therefore had said that such as these who had always compos'd the great Councils of our Nation had in favour of  Henry  the First bestow'd the Crown upon him as they had done upon his Father and Brother I should agree with him but 'tis the utmost extravagance to say that he who had neither title nor possession should give the power to those who had always bin in the possession of it and exercis'd it in giving to him whatsoever he had But I most wonder he should so far forget himself to call this  Henry  a Usurper and detract from the validity of his Acts because he had no title whereas there neither is was or can be a Usurper if there be any truth in his Doctrin for he plainly tells us we are only to look to the power and not at all to the means and ways by which it is obtain'd and making no difference between a King and a Tyrant enjoins an equal submission to the commands of both If this were only a slip of his Pen and he did really take this  Henry  to be a Usurper because he had not a good title I should desire to know the marks by which a lawful King is distinguish'd from an Usurper and in what a just Title dos consist If he place it in an hereditary Succession we ought to be inform'd whether this right must be deduc'd from one universal Lord of Mankind or from a particular Lord of every People If from the universal Lord the same descent that gives him a right to the dominion of any one Country enslaves the whole world to him  if from the particular Lord of one place proof must be given how he came to be so for if there was a defect in the first it can never be repair'd and the possession is no more than a continu'd Usurpation But having already prov'd the absurdity of any pretence to either I shall forbear the repetition and only say that if the course of Succession may never be justly interrupted the Family of  Meroveus  could not have had any right to the Crown of  France Pepin  was a Usurper if it must for ever have continu'd in the descendents of  Meroveus  and  Hugh Capet  could have no title if the Race of  Pepin  might not be dispossest I leave our Author to dispute this point with the King of  France  and when he has so far convinc'd him thathe is a Usurper as to persuade him to resign his Crown to the House of  Austria  claiming from  Pharamond  or to that of  Lorrain  as descended from  Pepin  I can give him half a dozen more knots which will not be with less difficulty unty'd and which instead of establishing the Titles of such Kings as are known to us will overthrow them all unless a Right be given to Usurpation or the consent of a People do confer it  But if there be such a thing as a Usurper and a Rule by which men may judg of Usurpation 'tis not only lawful but necessary to examin the Titles of such as go under the name of Kings that we may know whether they are truly so or not lest thro ignorance we chance to give the Veneration and Obedience that is due to a King to one who is not a King and deny it to him who by an uninterruptible Line of Descent is our natural Lord and thereby prefer the worst of men and our most bitter enemy before the Person we ought to look upon as our Father and if this prove dangerous to one or more Kings 'tis our Author's fault not mine  If there be no Usurper nor Rule of distinguishing him from a lawful Prince  Filmer  is the worst of all triflers and impostors who grounds his Arguments in the most serious matters upon what he esteems to be false but the truth is he seems to have set himself against humanity and common sense as much as against Law and Vertue and if he who so frequently contradicts himself can be said to mean any thing he would authorize rapine and murder and persuade us to account those to be rightful Kings who by treachery and other unjust means overthrow the right of Descent which he pretends to esteem sacred as well as the Libertys of Nations which by better Judges are thought to be so and gives the odious name of Usurpation to the Advancement of one who is made King by the consent of a willing People  But if  Henry  the First were a Usurper I desire to know whether the same name belongs to all our Kings or which of them deserves a better that we may understand whose acts ought to be reputed legal and to whose Descent we owe veneration or whether we are wholly exempted from all for I cannot see a possibility of fixing the guilt of Usurpation upon  Henry  the First without involving many if not all our Kings in the same  If his Title was not good because his Brother  Robert  was still living that of  Rufus  is by the same reason overthrown and  William  their Father being a bastard could have none This fundamental defect could never be repair'd sor the Successors could inherit no more than the right of the first which was nothing  Stephen  could deduce no Title either from  Norman  or  Saxon  whatsoever  Henry  the Second pretended must be from his Mother  Maud  and any other might have bin preser'd before her as well as he If her Title was from the  Normans  it must be void  since they had none and the story of  Edgar Atheling  is too impertinent to deserve mention But however it could be of no advantage to her for  David  King of  Scotland  Brother to her Mother from whom only her Title could be deriv'd was then alive with his Son  Henry  who dying not long after left three Sons and three Daughters whose posterity being distributed into many Familys of  Scotland  remains to this day and if proximity of blood is to be consider'd ought always to have bin prefer'd before her and her Descendents unless there be a Law that gives the preference to Daughters before Sons What right soever  Henry  the Second had it must necessarily have perish'd with him all his Children having bin begotten in manifest Adultery on  Eleanor  of  Gascony  during the life of  Lewis  King of  France  her first Husband and nothing could be alledg'd to color the business but a Dispensation from the Pope directly against the Law of God and the words of our Saviour who says  That a Wife cannot be put away unless for Adultery and he that marrys her that is put away commits Adultery  The pollution of this spring is not to be cur'd but tho it should pass unregarded no one part of the Succession since that time has remain'd intire  John  was prefer'd before  Arthur  his elder Brother's Son  Edward  the Third was made King by the deposition of his Father  Henry  the Fourth by that of  Richard  the Second If the House of  Mortimer  or  York  had the right  Henry  the  th    th  and  th  were not Kings and all who claim under them have no Title However  Richard  the Third could have none for the Children of his elder Brother the Duke of  Clarence  were then living The Children of  Edward  the Fourth may be suspected of Bastardy and tho it may have bin otherwise yet that matter is not so clear as things of such importance ought to be and the consequence may reach very far But tho that scruple were remov'd 'tis certain that  Henry  the Seventh was not King in the right of his Wife  Elizabeth  for he reign'd before and after her and for his other Titles we  Mem de Commin  may believe  Philip de Commines  who says  He had neither cross nor pile  If  Henry  the Eighth had a right in himself or from his Mother he should have reign'd immediately after her death which he never pretended nor to succeed till his Father was dead thereby acknowledging he had no right but from him unless the Parliament and People can give it The like may be said of his Children  Mary  could have no Title if she was a Bastard begotten in Incest but if her Mother's Marriage was good and she legitimate  Elizabeth  could have none  Yet all these were lawful Kings and Queens their Acts continue in force to this day to all intents and purposes the Parliament and People made them to be so when they had no other Title The Parliament and People therefore have the power of making Kings Those who are so made are not Usurpers We have had none but such for more than seven hundred years They were therefore lawful Kings or this Nation has had none in all that time and if our Author like this conclusion the account from whence it is drawn may without difficulty be carry'd as high as our  English  Historys do reach  This being built upon the steddy Foundation of Law History and Reason is not to be remov'd by any Man's opinion especially by one accompany'd with such circumstances as Sir  Walter Raleigh  was in during the last years of his life And there is something of baseness as well as prevarication in turning the words of an eminent Person reduc'd to great difficultys to a sense no way agreeing with his former Actions or Writings and no less tending to impair his Reputation than to deceive others  Our Author is highly guilty of both in citing Sir  Walter Raleigh  to invalidate the Great Charter of our Libertys as  begun by Ʋsurpation and shew'd to the world by Rebellion  whereas no such thing nor any thing like it in word or principle can be found in the Works that deserve to go under his Name The Dialogue in question with some other small Pieces publish'd after his death deserve to be esteem'd spurious Or if from a desire of Life when he knew his Head lay under the Ax he was brought to say things no way agreeing with what he had formerly profest they ought rather to be bury'd in oblivion than produc'd to blemish his Memory But that the publick Cause may not suffer by his fault 'tis convenient the World should be inform'd that tho he was a wellqualify'd Gentleman yet his Morals were no way exact as appears by his dealings with the brave Earl of  Essex  And he was so well assisted in his  History of the World  that an ordinary man with the same helps might have perform'd the same things Neither ought it to be accounted strange if that which he writ by himself had the tincture of another Spirit when he was depriv'd of that assistance tho his Life had not depended upon the will of the Prince and he had never said That  See Si  W Raleigh  's Epistle to King  James  the bond of Subjects to their Kings should always be wrought out of Iron and those of Kings to their Subjects out of Cobwebs  SECT XXXI Free Nations have a right of meeting when and where they please unless they deprive themselves of it  A Perverted Judgment always leads men into a wrong way and persuades them to believe that those things favor their cause that utterly overthrow it For a proof of this I desire our Author's words may be consider'd  In the former Parliaments  says he  instituted and continu'd since  Henry  the First his time is not to be found the usage of any natural Liberty of the People For all those Libertys that are claim'd in Parliament are Libertys of Grace from the King and not the Libertys of Nature to the People For if the Liberty were natural it would give power to the multitude to assemble themselves when and where they pleas'd to bestow the Sovereignty and by pactions to limit and direct the exercise of it  And I say that Nations being naturally free may meet when and where they please may dispose of the Sovereignty and may direct or limit the exercise of it unless by their own Act they have depriv'd themselves of that Right and there could never have bin a lawful Assembly of any People in the World if they had not had that Power in themselves It was prov'd in the preceding Section that all our Kings having no Title were no more than what the Nobility and People made them to be that they could have no Power but what was given to them and could confer none except what they had receiv'd If they can therefore call Parliaments the power of calling them must have bin given to them and could not be given by any who had it not in themselves The  Israelites  met together and chose  Ehud Gideon Sampson Jephtha  and others to be their Leaders whom they judg'd fit  to deliver them from their Enemys By the same right they assembl'd at  Mispeth  to make War against the Tribe of  Benjamin  when Justice was deny'd to be done against those who had villanously abus'd the Levite's Concubine In the like manner they would have made  Gideon  King but he refus'd In the same place they met and chose  Saul  to be their King He being dead the men of  Judah  assembl'd themselves and anointed  David  not long after all the Tribes met at  Hebron  made a Contract with him and receiv'd him as their King In the same manner tho by worse Counsel they made  Absalom  King And the like was attempted in favor of  Sheba  the Son of  Bichri  tho they then had a King chosen by themselves When they found themselves opprest by the Tributes that had bin laid upon them by  Solomon  they met at  Shechem  and being displeas'd with  Rehoboam  's answer to their complaints ten of the Tribes made  Jeroboam  King  Jehu  and all the other Kings of  Israel  whether good or bad had no other Title than was confer'd upon them by the prevailing part of the People which could not have given them any unless they had met together nor meet together without the consent and against the will of those that reign'd unless the Power had bin in themselves  Where Governments are more exactly regulated the Power of judging when 'tis fit to call the Senat or People together is refer'd to one or more Magistrats as in  Rome  to the Consuls or Tribuns in  Athens  to the Archons and in  Thebes  to the Beotarches but none of them could have these Powers unless they had bin given by those who advanc'd them to the Magistracys to which they were annex'd nor could they have bin so annex'd if those who created them had not had the right in themselves If they Officers neglected their duty of calling such Assemblys when the publick Affairs requir'd the People met by their own Authority and punish'd the Person or abrogated the Magistracy as appears in the case of the  Decemviri  and many others that might be alledg'd if the thing were not so plain as to need no further proof The reason of this is that they who institute a Magistracy best know whether the end of the Institution be rightly pursu'd or not And all just Magistracys being the same in essence tho differing in form the same right must perpetually belong to those who put the Sovereign Power into the hands of one a few or many men which is what our Author calls the Disposal of the Sovereignty Thus the  Romans  did when they created Kings Consuls Military Tribuns Dictators or  Decemviri  and it had bin most ridiculous to say that those Officers gave authority to the People to meet and chuse them for they who are chosen are the Creatures of those who chuse and are nothing more than others till they are chosen The last King of  Sweden Charles Gustavus  told a Gentleman who was Embassador there That the  Swedes  having made him King when he was poor and had nothing in the World he had but one work to do which was so to reign that they might never repent the good opinion they had conceiv'd of him They might therefore meet and did meet to conser the Sovereignty upon him or he could never have had it For tho the Kingdom be hereditary to Males or Females and his Mother was Sister to the Great  Gustavus  yet having marry'd a stranger without the consent of the Estates she perform'd not the Condition upon which Women are admitted to the Succession and thereby falling from her Right he pretended not to any The Act of his Election declares he had none and gives the Crown to him and the Heirs of his Body with this farther Declaration that the benefit of his Election should no way extend to his Brother Prince  Adolphus  and  'tis confest by all the  Swedish  Nation that if the King now reigning should die without Children the Estates would proceed to a new Election  'Tis rightly observ'd by our Author that if the People might meet and give the Sovereign Power they might also direct and limit it for they did meet in this and other Countrys they did confer the Sovereign Power they did limit and direct the exercise and the Laws of each People shew in what manner and measure it is every where done This is as certain in relation to Kings as any other Magistrats The Commission of the  Roman  Dictators was to take care  Ne quid detrimenti Respublica accipiat  T Liv  that the Commonwealth might receive no detriment  The same was sometimes given to the Consuls King  Offa  's Confession that he was made King  In vestrae Libertatis tuitionem  Mat Par  to preserve the publick Liberty  expresses the same thing And  Charles Gustavus  who said he had no other work than to govern in such a manner that they who had made him King might not repent shew'd there was a Rule which he stood oblig'd to follow and an end which he was to procure that he might merit and preserve their good opinion This power of conferring the Sovereignty was exercis'd in  France  by those who made  Meroveus  King in the prejudice of the two Grandchildren of  Pharamond  Sons to  Clodion  by those who excluded his Race and gave the Crown to  Pepin  by those who depos'd  Lewis le Debonair  and  Charles le Gross  by those who brought in five Kings that were either Bastards or Strangers between him and  Charles le Simple  by those who rejected his Race and advanc'd  Hugh Capet  by those who made  Henry  the First King to the prejudice of  Robert  his elder Brother and continu'd the Crown in the Race of  Henry  for ten Generations whilst the Descendents of  Robert  were only Dukes of  Burgundy  The like was done in  Castille  and  Arragon  by frequently preferring the younger before the elder Brother the Descendents of Females before those of the Maleline in the same degree the more remote in Blood before the nearest and sometimes Bastards before the legitimate Issue The same was done in  England  in relation to every King since the coming in of the  Normans  as I shew'd in the last Section and other places of this Work  That they who gave the Sovereignty might also circumscribe and direct it is manifest by the several ways of providing for the Succession instituted by several Nations Some are merely elective as the Empire of  Germany  and the Kingdom of  Poland  to this day the Kingdom of  Denmark  till the year that of  Sweden  till the time of  Gustavus Ericson  who deliver'd that Nation from the oppression of  Christern  II the cruel King of the  Danes  In others the Election was confin'd to one or more Familys as the Kingdom of the  Goths  in  Spain  to the  Balthei  and  Amalthei  In some the eldest Man of the reigning Family was prefer'd before the nearest as in  Scotland  before the time of  Kennethus  In other places the nearest in Blood is prefer'd before the elder if more remote In some no regard is had to Females or their Descendents as in  France  and  Turky  in others they or their Descendents are admitted either simply as well as Males or under a condition of marrying in the Country or with the consent of the Estates as in  Sweden  And no other reason can be given for this almost infinite variety of Constitutions than that they who made  them would have it so which could not be if God and Nature had appointed one General Rule for all Nations For in that case the Kingdom of  France  must be elective as well as that of  Poland  and the Empire or the Empire and  Poland  hereditary as that of  France  Daughters must succeed in  France  as well as in  England  or be excluded in  England  as in  France  and he that would establish one as the Ordinance of God and Nature must of necessity overthrow all the rest  A farther exercise of the natural Liberty of Nations is discover'd in the  De jur bel pac  several Limitations put upon the Sovereign Power Some Kings says  Grotius  have the  Summum Imperium summo modo  others  modo non summo  and amongst those that are under Limitations the degrees as to more or less are almost infinite as I have prov'd already by the example of  Arragon  antient  Germany  the  Saxon  Kings the  Normans  the Kings of  Castille  the present Empire with divers others And I may safely say that the antient Government of  France  was much of the same nature to the time of  Charles  the  th  and  Lewis  the  th  but the work of emancipating themselves as they call it begun by them is now brought to perfection in a boundless elevation of the King's Greatness and Riches to the unspeakable misery of the People  'Twere a folly to think this Variety proceeds from the Concessions of Kings who naturally delight in Power and hate that which crosses their Will It might with more reason be imagin'd that the  Roman  Consuls who were brought up in liberty who had contracted a love to their Country and were contented to live upon an equal foot with their fellow Citizens should confine the Power of their Magistracy to a year or that the Dukes of  Venice  should be graciously pleas'd to give power to the  Council of Ten  to punish them capitally if they transgrest the Laws than that Kings should put such Fetters upon their Power which they so much abhor or that they would suffer them if they could be easily broken If any one of them should prove so moderate like  Trajan  to command the Prefect of the Pretorian Guard to use the Sword for him if he govern'd well and against him if he did not it would soon be rescinded by his Successor the Law which has no other strength than the act of one man may be annul'd by another So that nothing dos more certainly prove that the Laws made in several Countrys to restrain the Power of Kings and variously to dispose of the Succession are not from them than the frequent examples of their fury who have expos'd themselves to the greatest dangers and brought infinite miserys upon the People thro the desire of breaking them It must therefore be concluded that Nations have power of meeting together and of conferring limiting and directing the Sovereignty or all must be grounded upon most manifest Injustice and Usurpation  No man can have a power over a Nation otherwise than  de jure  or  de facto  He who pretends to have a power  de jure  must prove that it is originally inherent in him or his predecessor from whom he inherits or that it was justly acquir'd by him The vanity of any pretence to an original Right appears sufficiently I hope from the proofs already given that the first Fathers of Mankind had it not or if they had no man could now inherit the same there being no man able to make good the Genealogy that should give him a right to the Succession Besides the facility we have of proving the beginnings of all the Familys that reign among us makes it as absurd for any of them to pretend a perpetual right to Dominion as for any Citizen of  London  whose Parents and Birth we know to say he is the very man  Noah  who liv'd in the time of the Flood and is now four or five thousand years old  If the power were confer'd on him or his Predecessors 'tis what we ask for the Collation can be of no value unless made by those who had a right to do it and the original Right by Descent failing no one can have any over a Free People but themselves or those to whom they have given it  If Acquisition be pretended 'tis the same thing for there can be no right to that which is acquir'd unless the right of invading be prov'd and that being done nothing can be acquir'd except what belong'd to the Person that was invaded and that only by him who had the right of invading No man ever did or could conquer a Nation by his own strength no man therefore could ever acquire a personal right over any and if it was confer'd upon him by those who made the Conquest with him they were the People that did it He can no more be said to have the Right originally in and from himself than a Magistrate of  Rome  or  Athens  immediately after his Creation and having no other at the beginning he can have none to eternity for the Nature of it must refer to the Original and cannot be chang'd by time  Whatsoever therefore proceeds not from the consent of the People must be  de facto  only that is void of all right and 'tis impossible there should not be a right of destroying that which is grounded upon none and by the same rule that one man enjoys what he gain'd by violence another may take it from him  Cyrus  overthrew the  Assyrians  and  Babylonians Alexander  the  Medes  and  Persians  and if they had no right of making war upon those Nations the Nations could not but have a right of recovering all that had bin unjustly taken from them and avenging the evils they had suffer'd If the cause of the war was originally just and not corrupted by an intemperate use of the victory the conquer'd People was perhaps oblig'd to be quiet but the conquering Armys that confer'd upon their Generals what they had taken from their Enemys might as justly expect an account of what they had given and that it should be imploy'd according to the intention of the givers as the People of any City might do from their regularly created Magistrats because it was as impossible for  Cyrus Alexander  or  Cesar  to gain a power over the Armys they led without their consent as for  Pericles Valerius  or any other disarm'd Citizen to gain more power in their respective Citys than was voluntarily confer'd upon them And I know no other difference between Kingdoms so constituted by conquering Armys and such as are establish'd in the most orderly manner than that the first usually incline more to War the latter to Justice and Peace But there have not bin wanting many of the first sort especially the Nations coming from the North who were no less exact in ordaining that which tended to the preservation of Liberty nor less severe in seeing it punctually perform'd than the most regular Commonwealths that ever were in the World And it can with no more reason be pretended that the  Goths  receiv'd their Privileges from  Alan  or  Theodoric  the  Francs  from  Pharamond  or  Meroveus  and the  English  from  Ina  or  Ethelred  than that the Liberty of  Athens  was the gift of  Themistocles  or  Pericles  that the Empire of  Rome  proceeded from the liberality of  Brutus  or  Valerius  and that the Commonwealth of  Venice  at this day subsists by the favor of the  Contarini  or  Moresini  which must reduce us to matter of Right since that of Fact void of Right can signify nothing  SECT XXXII The Powers of Kings are so various according to the Constitutions of several States that no Consequence can be drawn to the prejudice or advantage of any one merely from the Name  IN opposition to what is above said some alledg the name of  King  as if there were a charm in the word and our Author seems to put more weight upon it than in the Reasons he brings to support his Cause But that we may see there is no efficacy in it and that it conveys no other right than what particular Nations may annex to it we are to consider  That the most absolute Princes that are or have bin in the World never had the name of King whereas it has bin frequently given to those whose powers have bin very much restrain'd The  Cesars  were never call'd Kings till the sixth Age of Christianity the Califs and Soldan of  Egypt  and  Babylon  the Great  Turk  the Cham of  Tartary  or the Great  Mogol  never took that name nor any other of the same signification The  Czar  of  Moscovy  has it not tho he is as absolute a Monarch and his People as miserable slaves as any in the World On the other side the chief Magistrats of  Rome  and  Athens  for some time those of  Sparta Arragon Sweden Denmark  and  England who could do nothing but by Law  have bin call'd Kings This may be enough to shew that a Name being no way essential what Title soever is given to the Chief Magistrate he can have no other power than the Laws and Customs of his Country do give or the People confer upon him  The names of Magistrats are often chang'd tho the power continue to be the same and the powers are sometimes alter'd tho the name remain When  Octavius Cesar  by the force of a mad corrupted Soldiery had overthrown all Law and Right he took no other Title in relation to Military Affairs than that of  Imperator  which in the time of Liberty was by the Armys often given to Pretors and Consuls In Civil matters he was as he pretended  unitia potestate contentus  C  it  content with the power of Tribun and the like was observ'd in his Successor who to new invented Usurpations  gave old and approv'd names  On the other side those Titles which have bin render'd odious and execrable by the violent exercise of an absolute Power are sometimes made popular by moderate limitations as in  Germany  where tho the Monarchy seem to be as well temper'd as any the Princes retain the same names of  Imperator Cesar  and  Augustus  as those had done who by the excess of their rage and fury had desolated and corrupted the best part of the World  Sometimes the name is chang'd tho the power in all respects continue  Sa  vedra M  r  na    the same The Lords of  Castille  had for many Ages no other Title than that of Count and when the Nobility and People thought good they chang'd it to that of King without any addition to the power  The Sovereign Magistrat in  Poland  was call'd Duke till within the last two hundred years when they gave the title of King to one of the  Jagellan  Family which title has continu'd to this day tho without any change in the nature of the Magistracy And I presume no wise man will think that if the  Venetians  should give the name of King to their Duke it could  confer any other power upon him than he has already unless more should be confer'd by the Authority of the  Great Council  The same names which in some places denote the Supreme Magistracy in others are subordinate or merely titular In  England France  and  Spain  Dukes and Earls are Subjects in  Germany  the Electors and some Princes who are call'd by those names are little less than Sovereigns and the Dukes of  Savoy Tuscany Moscovy  and others acknowledg no Superior as well as those of  Poland  and  Castille  had none when they went under those titles The same may be said of Kings Some are subject to a foreign power as divers of them were subject to the  Persian  and  Babylonian  Monarchs who for that reason were call'd the Kings of Kings Some also are tributarys and when the  Spaniards  first landed in  America  the great Kings of  Mexico  and  Peru  had many others under them Threescore and ten Kings gather'd up meat under the Table of  Adonibezek  The  Romans  had many Kings depending upon them  Herod  and those of his Race were of this number and the dispute between him and his Sons  Aristobulus  and  Alexander  was to be determin'd by them neither durst he decide the matter till it was refer'd to him But a right of Appeal did still remain as appears by the case of St  Paul  when  Agrippa  was King The Kings of  Mauritania  from the time of  Massinissa  were under the like dependence  Jugurtha  went to  Rome  to justify himself for the death of  Micipsa Juba  was commanded by the  Roman  Magistrats  Scipio Petreius  and  Afranius  another  Juba  was made King of the same Country by  Augustus  and  Tiridates  of  Armenia  by  Nero  and infinite examples of this nature may be alledg'd Moreover their powers are variously regulated according to the variety of tempers in Nations and Ages Some have restrain'd the powers that by experience were found to be exorbitant others have dissolv'd the bonds that were laid upon them and Laws relating to the Institution Abrogation Enlargement or Restriction of the Regal Power would be utterly insignificant if this could not be done But such Laws are of no effect in any other Country than where they are made The lives of the  Spartans  did not depend upon the will of  Agesilaus  or  Leonidas  because  Nabuchodonosor  could kill or save whom he pleas'd and tho the King of  Marocco  may stab his Subjects throw them to the Lions or hang them upon tenterhooks yet a King of  Poland  would probably be call'd to a severe account if he should unjustly kill a single man  SECT XXXIII The Liberty of a People is the Gift of God and Nature  IF any man ask how Nations come to have the power of doing these things I answer That Liberty being only an exemption from the dominion of another the question ought not to be how a Nation can come to be free but how a man comes to have a dominion over it for till the right of Dominion be prov'd and justify'd Liberty subsists as arising from the Nature and Being of a man  Tertullian  speaking of the Emperors says  Ab eo Imperium à quo spiritus  and we taking man in his first condition may justly say  ab eo Libertas à quo spiritus  for no man can owe more than he has receiv'd The Creature having nothing and being nothing but what the Creator makes him must owe all to him and nothing to any one from whom he has receiv'd nothing Man therefore  must be naturally free unless he be created by another power than we have yet heard of The obedience due to Parents arises from hence in that they are the instruments of our Generation and we are instructed by the light of Reason that we ought to make great returns to those from whom under God we have receiv'd all When they die we are their Heirs we enjoy the same rights and devolve the same to our Posterity God only who confers this right upon us can deprive us of it and we can no way understand he dos so unless he had so declar'd by express Revelation or had set some distinguishing marks of Dominion and Subjection upon men and as an ingenious Person not long since said caus'd some to be born with Crowns on their heads and all others with Saddles upon their backs This Liberty therefore must continue till it be either forfeited or willingly resign'd The forfeiture is hardly comprehensible in a multitude that is not enter'd into any Society for as they are all equal and  Par in parem non habet imperium  equals can have no right over each other  no man can forfeit any thing to one who can justly demand nothing unless it may be by a personal injury which is nothing to this case because where there is no Society one man is not bound by the actions of another All cannot join in the same Act because they are join'd in none or if they should no man could recover much less transmit the forfeiture and not being transmitted it perishes as if it had never bin and no man can claim any thing from it  'Twill be no less difficult to bring resignation to be subservient to our Author's purpose for men could not resign their Liberty unless they naturally had it in themselves Resignation is a publick declaration of their assent to be govern'd by the Person to whom they resign that is they do by that Act constitute him to be their Governor This necessarily puts us upon the inquiry Why they do resign how they will be govern'd and proves the Governor to be their creature and the right of disposing the Government must be in them or they who receive it can have none This is so evident to common sense that it were impertinent to ask who made  Carthage Athens Rome  or  Venice  to be free Citys Their Charters were not from men but from God and Nature When a number of  Phenicians  had found a Port on the Coast of  Africa  they might perhaps agree with the Inhabitants for a parcel of Ground but they brought their Liberty with them When a company of  Latins Sabins  and  Tuscans  met together upon the Banks of the  Tiber  and chose rather to build a City for themselves than to live in such as were adjacent they carry'd their Liberty in their own Breasts and had Hands and Swords to defend it This was their Charter and  Romulus  could confer no more upon them than  Dido  upon the  Carthaginians  When a multitude of barbarous Nations infested  Italy  and no protection could be expected from the corrupted and perishing Empire such as agreed to seek a place of refuge in the scatter'd Islands of the  Adriatick  Gulf had no need of any man's Authority to ratify the Institution of their Government They who were the formal part of the City and had built the material could not but have a right of governing as they pleas'd since if they did amiss the hurt was only to themselves 'Tis probable enough that some of the  Roman  Emperors as Lords of the Soil might have pretended to a Dominion over them if there had bin any color for it but nothing of that kind appearing in thirteen hundred years we are not like to hear of any  such cavils 'Tis agreed by Mankind that subjection and protection are relative and that he who cannot protect those that are under him in vain pretends to a Dominion over them The only ends for which Governments are constituted and obedience render'd to them are the obtaining of Justice and Protection and they who cannot provide for both give the People a right of taking such ways as best please themselves in order to their own safety  The matter is yet more clear in relation to those who never were in any Society as at the beginning or renovation of the World after the Flood or who upon the dissolution of the Societys to which they did once belong or by some other accident have bin oblig'd to seek new habitations Such were those who went from  Babylon  upon the confusion of Tongues those who escap'd from  Troy  when it was burnt by the  Grecians  almost all the Nations of  Europe  with many of  Asia  and  Africa  upon the dissolution of the  Roman  Empire To which may be added a multitude of Northern Nations who when they had increas'd to such numbers that their Countrys could no longer nourish them or because they wanted skill to improve their Lands were sent out to provide for themselves and having done so did erect many Kingdoms and States either by themselves or in union and coalition with the antient Inhabitants  'Tis in vain to say that wheresoever they came the Land did belong to some body and that they who came to dwell there must be subject to the Laws of those who were Lords of the Soil for that is not always true in fact Some come into desert Countrys that have no Lord others into such as are thinly peopled by men who knowing not how to improve their Land do either grant part of it upon easy terms to the new comers or grow into a union with them in the enjoyment of the whole and Historys furnish us with infinite examples of this nature  If we will look into our own original without troubling our selves with the sensless storys of  Samothes  the Son of  Japhet  and his Magicians or the Giants begotten by Spirits upon the thirty Daughters of  Danaus  sent from  Phenicia  in a Boat without Sails Oars or Rudder we shall find that when the  Romans  abandon'd this Island the Inhabitants were left to a full liberty of providing for themselves and whether we deduce our Original from them or the  Saxons  or from both our Ancestors were perfectly free and the  Normans  having inherited the same Right when they came to be one Nation with the former we cannot but continue so still unless we have enslav'd our selves  Nothing is more contrary to reason than to imagin this When the fierce barbarity of the  Saxons  came to be softned by a more gentle Climat the Arts and Religion they learnt taught them to reform their Manners and better enabled them to frame Laws for the preservation of their Liberty but no way dimish'd their love to it and tho the  Normans  might desire to get the Laads of those who had join'd with  Harold  and of others into their hands yet when they were settled in the Country and by marriages united to the antient Inhabitants they became true Englishmen and no less lovers of Liberty and resolute defenders of it than the  Saxons  had bin There was then neither conquering  Norman  nor conquer'd  Saxon  but a great and brave People compos'd of both united in blood and interest in the defence of their common Rights which they so well maintain'd that no Prince since that time has too violently encroach'd upon them who as the reward of his folly has not liv'd miserably and dy'd shamefully  Such actions of our Ancestors do not as I suppose savor much of the submission which patrimonial slaves do usually render to the will of their Lord On the contrary whatsoever they did was by a power inherent in themselves to defend that Liberty in which they were born All their Kings were created upon the same condition and for the same ends  Alfred  acknowledg'd he found and left them perfectly free and the confession of  Offa  that they had not made him King for his own merits but for the defence of their Liberty comprehends all that were before and after him They well knew how great the honor was to be made Head of a great People and rigorously exacted the performance of the ends for which such a one was elevated severely punishing those who basely and wickedly betray'd the Trust repos'd in them and violated all that is most sacred among men which could not have bin unless they were naturally free for the Liberty that has no being cannot be defended  SECT XXXIV No Veneration paid or Honor confer'd upon a just and lawful Magistrate can diminish the Liberty of a Nation  SOME have suppos'd that tho the People be naturally free and Magistrats created by them they do by such Creations deprive themselves of that natural Liberty and that the names of  King Sovereign Lord  and  Dread Sovereign  being no way consistent with Liberty they who give such Titles do renounce it Our Author carrys this very far and lays great weight upon the submissive Language us'd by the People when they  humbly crave that his Majesty would be pleas'd to grant their accustom'd freedom of speech and access to his Person  and  give the name of Supplications and Petitions to the Addresses made to him  Whereas he answers in the haughty Language of  Le Roy le veut Le Roy s'avisera  and the like But they who talk at this rate shew that they neither understand the nature of Magistracy nor the practice of Nations Those who have liv'd in the highest exercise of their Liberty and have bin most tenacious of it have thought no Honor too great for such Magistrats as were eminent in the defence of their Rights and set up for that end The name of Dread Sovereign might justly have bin given to a  Roman  Dictator or Consul for they had the Sovereign Authority in their hands and power sufficient for its execution Whilst their Magistracy continu'd they were a terror to the same men whose Axes and Rods had bin a terror to them the year or month before and might be so again the next The  Romans  thought they could not be guilty of excess in carrying the power and veneration due to their Dictator to the highest And  Livy  tells us that his  Edictum Dictatoris pro numine observatum  Hist  l  Edicts were esteem'd sacred  I have already shewn that this haughty People who might have commanded condescended to join with their Tribuns in a Petition to the Dictator  Papirius  for the Life of  Quintus Fabius  who had fought a Battel in his absence and without his order tho he had gain'd a great and memorable Victory The same  Fabius  when Consul was commended by his Father  Q Fabius Maximus  for obliging him by his Lictors to dismount from his Horse and to pay him the same respect that was due from others The Tribuns of the People who were instituted for the preservation of Liberty were also esteem'd sacred and inviolable as appears by that phrase  Sacrosancta Tribunorum potestas  so common in their antient Writers No man I presume thinks any Monarchy more limited or more clearly deriv'd from a delegated Power than that of the  German  Emperors and yet  Sacra Caesarea Majestas  is the publick stile Nay the  Hollanders  at this day call their Burgermasters tho they see them selling Herring or Tar  High and Mighty Lords  as soon as they are advanc'd to be of the or Magistrats of a small Town 'Tis no wonder therefore if a great Nation should think it conducing to their own glory to give magnificent Titles and use submissive language to that one man whom they set up to be their Head most especially if we consider that they came from a Country where such Titles and Languages were principally invented  Among the  Romans  and  Grecians  we hear nothing of Majesty Highness Serenity and Excellence appropriated to a single Person but receive them from  Germany  and other Northern Countrys We find  Majestas Populi Romani  and  Majestas Imperii  in their best Authors but no man speaking to  Julius  or  Augustus  or even to the vaniest of their Successors ever us'd those empty Titles nor took upon themselves the name of Servants as we do to every fellow we meet in the Streets When such ways of speaking are once introduc'd they must needs swell to a more than ordinary height in all transactions with Princes Most of them naturally delight in vanity and Courtiers never speak more truth than when they most extol their Masters and assume to themselves the names that best express the most abject slavery These being brought into mode like all ill Customs increase by use and then no man can omit them without bringing that danger and hatred upon himself which few will undergo except for something that is evidently of great importance Matters of ceremony and title at the first seem not to be so and being for some time neglected they acquire such strength as not to be easily remov'd From private Usage they pass into publick Acts and those Flatterers who gave a beginning to them proposing them in publick Councils where too many of that sort have always insinuated themselves gain credit enough to make them pass This work was farther advanc'd by the Church of  Rome  according to their custom of favouring that most which is most vain and corrupt and it has bin usual with the Popes and their adherents liberally to gratify Princes for Services render'd to the Church with Titles that tended only to the prejudice of the people These poisonous Plants having taken root grew up so fast that the Titles which within the space of a hundred years were thought sufficient for the Kings and Queens of  England  have of late bin given to  Monk  and his honourable Dutchess New phrases have bin invented to please Princes or the sense of the old perverted as has happen'd to that of  Le Roy s' avisera  And that which was no more than a liberty to consult with the Lords upon a Bill presented by the Commons is by some men now taken sor a Right inherent in the King of denying such Bills as may be offer'd to him by the Lords and Commons tho the Coronation Oath obliges him to hold keep and defend the just Laws and Customs  quas vulgus elegerit  And if a stop be not put to this exorbitant abuse the words still remaining in Acts of Parliament which shew that their Acts are our Laws may perhaps be also abolish'd  But tho this should come to pass by the slackness of the Lords and Commons it could neither create a new Right in the King nor diminish that of the People But it might give a better color to those who are Enemys to their Country to render the Power of the Crown arbitrary than any thing that is yet among us  SECT XXXV The Authority given by our Law to the Acts perform'd by a King  de facto  detract nothing from the Peoples right of creating whom they please  THEY who have more regard to the prevailing Power than to Right and lay great weight upon the Statute of  Henry  the seventh which authorizes the Acts of a  King de facto  seem not to consider that thereby they destroy all the pretended right of Inheritance that he only is King  de facto  who is receiv'd by the People and that this reception could neither be of any value in it felf nor be made valid by a Statute unless the People and their Representatives who make the Statute had in themselves the power of receiving authorizing and creating whom they please For he is not King  de facto  who calls himself so as  Perkin  or  Simnel  but he who by the consent of the Nation is possest of the Regal Power If there were such a thing in nature as a natural Lord over every Country and that the right must go by descent it would be impossible for any other man to acquire it or for the people to confer it upon him and to give the Authority to the Acts of one who neither is nor can be a King which belongs only to him who has the right inherent in himself and inseparable from him Neither can it be deny'd that the same power which gives the validity to such Acts as are perform'd by one who is not a King that belongs to those of a true King may also make him King for the essence of a King consists in the validity of his Acts And 'tis equally absurd for one to pretend to be a King whose Acts as King are not valid as that his own can be valid if those of another are for then the same indivisible Right which our Author and those of his principles assert to be inseparable from the Person would be at the same time exercis'd and enjoy'd by two distinct and contrary Powers  Moreover it may be observ'd that this Statute was made after frequent and bloody Wars concerning Titles to the Crown and whether the cause were good or bad those who were overcome were not only subject to be kill'd in the field but afterwards to be prosecuted as Traitors under the color of Law He who gain'd the Victory was always set up to be King by those of his party and he never fail'd to proceed against his Enemys as Rebels This introduc'd a horrid series of the most destructive mischiefs The Fortune of War vary'd often and I think it may be said that there were few if any great Familys in  England  that were not either destroy'd or at least so far shaken as to lose their Chiefs and many considerable branches of them And experience taught that instead of gaining any advantage to the Publick in point of Government  he for whom they fought seldom prov'd better than his Enemy They saw that the like might again happen tho the title of the reigning King should be as clear as descent of blood could make it This brought things into an uneasy posture and 'tis not strange that both the Nobility and Commonalty should be weary of it No Law could prevent the dangers of battel for he that had followers and would venture himself might bring them to such a decision as was only in the hand of God But thinking no more could justly be requir'd to the full performance of their Duty to the King than to expose themselves to the hazard of battel for him and not being answerable for the success they would not have that Law which they endeavour'd to support turn'd to their destruction by their Enemys who might come to be the interpreters of it But as they could be exempted from this danger only by their own Laws which could authorize the Acts of a King without a Title and justify them for acting under him 'tis evident that the power of the Law was in their hands and that the acts of the person who enjoy'd the Crown were of no value in themselves The Law had bin impertinent if it could have bin done without Law and the Intervention of the Parliament useless if the Kings  de facto  could have given authority to their own Acts But if the Parliament could make that to have the effect of Law which was not Law and exempt those that acted according to it from the penaltys of the Law and give the same force to the Acts of one who is not King as of one who is they cannot but have a power of making him to be King who is not so that is to say all depends intirely upon their Authority  Besides he is not King who assumes the title to himself or is set up by a corrupt party but he who according to the usages requir'd in the case is made King If these are wanting he is neither  de facto  nor  de jure  but  Tyrannus sine Titulo  Nevertheless this very man if he comes to be receiv'd by the People and plac'd in the Throne he is thereby made King  de facto  His Acts are valid in Law the same service is due to him as to any other they who render it are in the same manner protected by the Law that is to say he is truly King If our Author therefore do allow such to be Kings he must confess that power to be good which makes them so when they have no right in themselves If he deny it he must not only deny that there is any such thing as a King  de facto  which the Statute acknowledges but that we ever had any King in  England  for we never had any other than such as I have prov'd before  By the same means he will so unravel all the Law that no man shall know what he has or what he ought to do or avoid and will find no remedy for this unless he allow that Laws made without Kings are as good as those made with them which returns to my purpose for they who have the power of making Laws may by Law make a King as well as any other Magistrate And indeed the intention of this Statute could be no other than to secure mens Persons and Possessions and so far to declare the power of giving and taking away the Crown to be in the Parliament as to remove all disputes concerning Titles and to make him to be a Legal King whom they acknowledg to be King  SECT XXXVI The general revolt of a Nation cannot be call'd a Rebellion  AS Impostors seldom make lies to pass in the world without putting false names upon things such as our Author endeavour to persuade the People they ought not to defend their Libertys by giving the name of Rebellion to the most just and honourable actions that have bin perform'd fer the preservation of them and to aggravate the matter tell us that Rebellion is like the sin of Witchcraft But those who seek after truth will easily find that there can be no such thing in the world as the rebellion of a Nation against its own Magistrats and that Rebellion is not always evil That this may appear it will not be amiss to consider the word as well as the thing commonly understood by it as it is us'd in an evil sense  The word is taken from the Latin  rebellare  which signifys no more than to renew a war When a Town or Province had bin subdu'd by the  Romans  and brought under their dominion if they violated their Faith after the settlement of Peace and invaded their Masters who had spar'd them they were said to rebel But it had bin more absurd to apply that word to the People that rose against the  Decemviri  Kings or other Magistrats than to the  Parthians  or any of those Nations who had no dependence upon them for all the circumstances that should make a Rebellion were wanting the word implying a superiority in them against whom it is as well as the breach of an establish'd Peace But tho every private man singly taken be subject to the commands of the Magistrate the whole body of the People is not so for he is by and for the People and the People is neither by nor for him The obedience due to him from private men is grounded upon and measur'd by the General Law and that Law regarding the welfare of the People cannot set up the interest of one or a few men against the publick The whole body therefore of a Nation cannot be ty'd to any other obedience than is consistent with the common good according to their own judgment and having never bin subdu'd or brought to terms of peace with their Magistrats they cannot be said to revolt or rebel against them to whom they owe no more than seems good to themselves and who are nothing of or by themselves more than other men  Again the thing signify'd by rebellion is not always evil for tho every subdu'd Nation must acknowledg a superiority in those who have subdu'd them and rebellion dos imply a breach of the peace yet that superiority is not infinite the peace may be broken upon just grounds and it may be neither a crime nor infamy to do it The  Privernates  had bin more than once subdu'd by the  Romans  and had as often rebel'd Their  L  v l  City was at last taken by  Plautius  the Consul after their Leader  Virtuvius  and great numbers of their Senat and People had bin kill'd Being reduc'd to a low condition they sent Embassadors to  Rome  to desire peace where when a Senator ask'd them what punishment they deserv'd one of them answer'd  The same which they deserve who think themselves worthy of Liberty  The Consul then demanded  what kind of Peace might  be expected from them if the punishment should be remitted  The Embassador answer'd  Si bonam dederitis fidam perpetuam si malam haud diuturnam  Liv  If the terms you give be good the Peace will be observ'd by us faithfully and perpetually if bad it will soon be broken  And tho some were offended with the ferocity of the answer yet the best part of the Senat approv'd it as  Viri liberi vocem auditam  Ibid  worthy of a man and a freeman  and confessing that no Man or Nation would continue under an uneasy condition longer than they were compel'd by force said  Eos demum qui nihil praeterquam de libertate cogitant dignos esse qui Romani fiant  Ibid  They only were fit to be made  Romans  who thought nothing valuable but Liberty  Upon which they were all made Citizens of  Rome  and obtain'd whatsoever they had desir'd  I know not how this matter can be carry'd to a greater height for if it were possible that a People resisting oppression and vindicating their own Liberty could commit a crime and incur either guilt or infamy the  Privernates  did who had bin often subdu'd and often pardon'd but even in the judgment of their Conquerors whom they had offended the resolution they profest of standing to no agreement impos'd upon them by necessity was accounted the highest testimony of such a Vertue as render'd them worthy to be admitted into a Society and equality with themselves who were the most brave and vertuous people of the world  But if the patience of a conquer'd People may have limits and they who will not bear oppression from those who had spar'd their Lives may deserve praise and reward from their conquerors it would be madness to think that any Nation can be oblig'd to bear whatsoever their own Magistrats think fit to do against them This may seem strange to those who talk so much of conquests made by Kings Immunitys Libertys and Privileges granted to Nations Oaths of Allegiance taken and wonderful benefits confer'd upon them But having already said as much as is needful concerning Conquests and that the Magistrate who has nothing except what is given to him can only dispense out of the publick Stock such Franchises and Privileges as he has receiv'd for the reward of Services done to the Country and encouragement of Vertue I shall at present keep my self to the two last points  Allegiance signifys no more as the words  ad legem  declare than such an obedience as the Law requires But as the Law can require nothing from the whole People who are masters of it Allegiance can only relate to particulars and not to the whole Nation No Oath can bind any other than those who take it and that only in the true sense and meaning of it but single men only take this Oath and therefore single men are only oblig'd to keep it the body of a People neither dos nor can perform any such act Agreements and Contracts have bin made as the Tribe of  Judah  and the rest of  Israel  afterward made a Covenant with  David  upon which they made him King but no wise man can think that the Nation did thereby make themselves the Creature of their own Creature  The sense also of an Oath ought to be consider'd No man can by an Oath be oblig'd to any thing beyond or contrary to the true meaning of it private men who swear obedience  ad Legem  swear no obedience  extra  or  contra Legem  whatsoever they promise or swear can detract nothing from the publick Liberty which the Law principally intends to preserve Tho many of them may be oblig'd in their several Stations and Capacitys to render peculiar services to a Prince the People continue as sree as the  internal thoughts of a man and cannot but have a right to preserve their Liberty or avenge the violation  If matters are well examin'd perhaps not many Magistrats can pretend to much upon the title of merit most especially if they or their progenitors have continu'd long in Office The conveniences annex'd to the exercise of the Sovereign power may be thought sufficient to pay such scores as they grow due even to the best and as things of that nature are handled I think it will hardly be found that all Princes can pretend to an irresistible power upon the account of beneficence to their People When the family of  Medices  came to be masters of  Tuscany  that Country was without dispute in men mony and arms one of the most flourishing Provinces in the World as appears by  Macchiavel  's account and the relation of what happen'd between  Charles  the eighth and the Magistrats of  Florence  which I have mention'd already from  Guicciardin  Now whoever shall consider the strength of that Country in those days together with what it might have bin in the space of a hundred and forty years in which they have had no war nor any other plague than the extortion fraud rapin and cruelty of their Princes and compare it with their present desolate wretched and contemptible condition may if he please think that much veneration is due to the Princes that govern them but will never make any man believe that their Title can be grounded upon beneficenee The like may be said of the Duke of  Savoy  who pretending upon I know not what account that every Peasant in the Dutchy ought to pay him two Crowns every half year did in subtilly find out that in every year there were thirteen halves so that a poor man who had nothing but what he gain'd by hard labor was thro his fatherly Care and Beneficence forc'd to pay six and twenty Crowns to his Royal Highness to be employ'd in his discreet and vertuous pleasures at  Turin  The condition of the seventeen Provinces of the  Netherlands  and even of  Spain  it self when they fell to the house of  Austria  was of the same nature and I will confess as much as can be requir'd if any other marks of their Government do remain than such as are manifest evidences of their Pride Avarice Luxury and Cruelty  France  in outward appearance makes a better show but nothing in this world is more miserable than that people under the fatherly care of their triumphant Monarch The best of their condition is like Asses and Mastiff dogs to work and fight to be opprest and kill'd for him and those among them who have any understanding well know that their industry courage and good success is not only unprofitable but destructive to them and that by increasing the power of their Master they add weight to their own Chains And if any Prince or succession of Princes have made a more modest use of their Power or more faithfully discharg'd the trust repos'd in them it must be imputed peculiarly to them as a testimony of their personal Vertue and can have no effect upon others  The Rights therefore of Kings are not grounded upon Conquest the Libertys of Nations do not arise from the Grants of their Princes the Oath of Allegiance binds no private man to more than the Law directs and has no influence upon the whole Body of every Nation Many Princes are known to their Subjects only by the injurys losses and mischiefs brought upon them such as are good and just ought to be rewarded for their personal Vertue but can confer no right upon those who no way  resemble them and whoever pretends to that merit must prove it by his Actions Rebellion being nothing but a renew'd War can never be against a Government that was not establish'd by War and of it self is neither good nor evil more than any other War but is just or unjust according to the cause or manner of it Besides that Rebellion which by  Samuel  is compar'd to Witchcraft is not of private men or a People against  Sam  the Prince but of the Prince against God The  Israelites  are often said to have rebel'd against the Law Word or Command of God but tho they frequently oppos'd their Kings I do not find Rebellion imputed to them on that account nor any ill character put upon such actions We are told also of some Kings who had bin subdu'd and afterwards rebel'd against  Chedorlaomer  and other Kings but their cause is not blam'd and we have some reason to believe it good because  Abraham  took part with those who had rebel'd However it can be of no prejudice to the cause I defend for tho it were true that those subdu'd Kings could not justly rise against the person who had subdu'd them or that generally no King being once vanquish'd could have a right of Rebellion against his Conqueror it could have no relation to the actions of a People vindicating their own Laws and Libertys against a Prince who violates them for that War which never was can never be renew'd And if it be true in any case that hands and swords are given to men that they only may be slaves who have no courage it must be when Liberty is overthrown by those who of all men ought with the utmost industry and vigor to have defended it  That this should be known is not only necessary for the safety of Nations but advantageous to such Kings as are wise and good They who know the frailty of human Nature will always distrust their own and desiring only to do what they ought will be glad to be restrain'd from that which they ought not to do Being taught by reason and experience that Nations delight in the Peace and Justice of a good Government they will never fear a general Insurrection whilst they take care it be rightly administer'd and finding themselves by this means to be safe will never be unwilling that their Children or Successors should be oblig'd to tread in the same steps  If it be said that this may sometimes cause disorders I acknowledg it but no human condition being perfect such a one is to be chosen which carrys with it the most tolerable inconveniences And it being much better than the irregularitys and excesses of a Prince should be restrain'd or supprest than that whole Nations should perish by them those Constitutions that make the best provision against the greatest evils are most to be commended If Governments were instituted to gratify the lusts of one man those could not be good that set limits to them but all reasonable men confessing that they are instituted for the good of Nations they only can deserve praise who above all things endeavour to procure it and appoint means proportion'd to that end The great variety of Governments which we see in the World is nothing but the effect of this care and all Nations have bin and are more  or less happy as they or their Ancecestors have had vigor of Spirit integrity of Manners and wisdom to invent and establish such Orders as have better or worse provided for this common Good which was sought by all But as no Rule can be so exact to make provision against all contestations and all disputes about Right do naturally end in force when Justice is deny'd ill men never willingly submitting to any decision that is contrary to their passions and interests the best Constitutions are of no value if there be not a Power to  support them This Power first exerts it self in the execution of Justice by the ordinary Officers but no Nation having bin so happy as not sometimes to produce such Princes as  Edward  and  Richard  the Seconds and such Ministers as  Gaveston Spencer  and  Tresilian  the ordinary Officers of Justice often want the will and always the power to restrain them So that the Rights and Libertys of a Nation must be utterly subverted and abolish'd if the power of the whole may not be employ'd to assert them or punish the violation of them But as it is the fundamental Right of every Nation to be govern'd by such Laws in such Manner and by such Persons as they think most conducing to their own good they cannot be accountable to any but themselves for what they do in that most important affair  SECT XXXVII The  English  Government was not ill constituted the defects more lately observ'd proceeding from the change of manners and corruption of the times  I Am not ignorant that many honest and good men acknowledging these Rights and the care of our Ancestors to preserve them think they wanted wisdom rightly to proportionate the means to the end 'Tis not enough say they for the General of an Army to desire Victory he only can deserve praise who has skill industry and courage to take the best measures of obtaining it Neither is it enough for wise Legislators to preserve Liberty and to erect such a Government as may stand for a time but to set such clear Rules to those who are to put it in execution that every man may know when they transgress and appoint such means for restraining or punishing them as may be us'd speedily surely and effectually without danger to the Publick  Sparta  being thus constituted we hardly find that for more than eight hundred years any King presum'd to pass the limits prescrib'd by the Law If any  Roman  Consul grew insolent he might be reduc'd to order without blood or danger to the Publick and no Dictator ever usurp'd a power over Liberty till the time of  Sylla  when all things in the City were so chang'd that the antient foundations were become too narrow In  Venice  the power of the Duke is so circumscrib'd that in years no one except  Falerio  and  Tiepoli  has dar'd to attempt any thing against the Laws and they were immediately supprest with little commotion in the City On the other side our Law is so ambiguous perplext and intricate that 'tis hard to know when 'tis broken In all the publick contests we have had men of good judgment and integrity have follow'd both partys The means of transgressing and procuring Partizans to make good by force the most notorious violations of Liberty have bin so easy that no Prince who has endeavour'd it ever fail'd to get great numbers of followers and to do infinite mischiefs before he could be remov'd The Nation has bin brought to sight against those they had made to be what they were upon the unequal terms of hazarding all against nothing If they had success they gain'd no more than what was their own before and which the Law ought to have secur'd whereas 'tis evident that if at any one time the contrary  had happen'd the Nation had bin utterly enslav'd and no victory was ever gain'd without the loss of much noble and innocent blood  To this I answer that no right judgment can be given of human things without a particular regard to the time in which they pass'd We esteem  Scipio Hannibal Pyrrhus Alexander Epimanondas  and  Cesar  to have bin admirable Commanders in War because they had in a most eminent degree all the qualitys that could make them so and knew best how to employ the Arms then in use according to the disciplin of their times and yet no man doubts that if the most skilful of them could be rais'd from the Grave restor'd to the utmost vigor of mind and body set at the head of the best Armys he ever commanded and plac'd upon the Frontiers of  France  or  Flanders  he would not know how to advance or retreat nor by what means to take any of the places in those parts as they are now fortify'd and defended but would most certainly be beaten by any insignificant fellow with a small number of men furnish'd with such Arms as are now in use and following the methods now practis'd Nay the manner of marching encamping besieging attacking defending and fighting is so much alter'd within the last threescore years that no man observing the disciplin that was then thought to be the best could possibly defend himself against that which has bin since found out tho the terms are still the same And if it be consider'd that political matters are subject to the same mutations as certainly they are it will be sufficient to excuse our Ancestors who suting their Government to the Ages in which they liv'd could neither foresee the changes that might happen in future Generations nor appoint remedys for the mischiefs they did not foresee  They knew that the Kings of several Nations had bin kept within the limits of the Law by the vertue and power of a great and brave Nobility and that no other way of supporting a mix'd Monarchy had ever bin known in the World than by putting the balance into the hands of those who had the greatest interests in Nations and who by Birth and Estate enjoy'd greater advantages than Kings could confer upon them for rewards of betraying their Country They knew that when the Nobility was so great as not easily to be number'd the little that was left to the King's disposal was not sufficient to corrupt many and if some might fall under the temptation those who continu'd in their integrity would easily be able to chastise them for deserting the publick Cause and by that means deter Kings from endeavouring to seduce them from their duty Whilst things continu'd in this posture Kings might safely be trusted with the advice of their Council to confer the commands of the Militia in Towns and Provinces upon the most eminent men in them And whilst those Kings were exercis'd in almost perpetual Wars and plac'd their glory in the greatness of the Actions they atchiev'd by the power and valor of their People it was their interest always to chuse such as seem'd best to deserve that honor It was not to be imagin'd that thro the weakness of some and the malice of others those Dignitys should by degrees be turn'd into empty Titles and become the rewards of the greatest crimes and the vilest services or that the noblest of their Descendents for want of them should be brought under the name of Commoners and depriv'd of all privileges except such as were common to them with their Grooms Such a stupendous change being in process of time insensibly introduc'd the foundations of that Government which they had establish'd were remov'd and the superstructure overthrown The balance by which  it subsisted was broken and 'tis as impossible to restore it as for most of those who at this day go under the name of Noblemen to perform the dutys requir'd from the antient Nobility of  England  And tho there were a charm in the name and those who have it should be immediately fill'd with a spirit like to that which animated our Ancestors and endeavor to deserve the Honors they possess by such Services to the Country as they ought to have perform'd before they had them they would not be able to accomplish it They have neither the Interest nor the Estates requir'd for so great a work Those who have Estates at a rack Rent have no dependents Their Tenants when they have paid what is agreed owe them nothing and knowing they shall be turn'd out of their Tenements as soon as any other will give a little more they look upon their Lords as men who receive more from them than they confer upon them This dependence being lost the Lords have only more mony to spend or lay up than others but no command of men and can therefore neither protect the weak nor curb the insolent By this means all things have bin brought into the hands of the King and the Commoners and there is nothing left to cement them and to maintain the union The perpetual jarrings we hear every day the division of the Nation into such factions as threaten us with ruin and all the disorders that we see or fear are the effects of this rupture These things are not to be imputed to our original Constitutions but to those who have subverted them And if they who by corrupting changing enervating and annihilating the Nobility which was the principal support of the antient regular Monarchy have driven those who are truly Noblemen into the same interest and name with the Commons and by that means increas'd a party which never was and I think never can be united to the Court they are to answer for the Consequences and if they perish their destruction is from themselves  The inconveniences therefore proceed not from the Institution but from the Innovation The Law was plain but it has bin industriously render'd perplex They who were to have upheld it are overthrown That which might have bin easily perform'd when the People was arm'd and had a great strong vertuous and powerful Nobility to lead them is made difficult now they are disarm'd and that Nobility abolish'd Our Ancestors may evidently appear not only to have intended well but to have taken a right course to accomplish what they intended This had effect as long as the cause continu'd and the only fault that can be ascrib'd to that which they establish'd is that it has not prov'd to be perpetual which is no more than may be justly said of the best human Constitutions that ever have bin in the world If we will be just to our Ancestors it will become us in our time rather to pursue what we know they intended and by new Constitutions to repair the breaches made upon the old than to accuse them of the defects that will for ever attend the Actions of men Taking our Affairs at the worst we shall soon find that if we have the same spirit they had we may easily restore our Nation to its antient Liberty Dignity and Happiness and if we do not the fault is owing to our selves and not to any want of vertue and wisdom in them  SECT XXXVIII The power of calling and dissolving Parliaments is not simply in the King The variety of Customs in chusing Parliament men and the Errors a People may commit neither prove that Kings are or ought to be Absolute  THE original of Magistratical Power the intention of our Ancestors in its creation and the ways prescrib'd for the direction and limitation of it may I presume sufficiently appear by what has bin said But because our Author taking hold of every twig pretends  That Kings may call and dissolve Parliaments at their pleasure  and from thence infers  the Power to be wholly in them  alledges  the various Customs in several parts of this Nation us'd in the Elections of Parliament men to procced from the King's will  and  because a People may commit Errors  thinks  all Power ought to be put into the hands of the King  I answer That the Power of calling and dissolving Parliaments is not simply in Kings They may call Parliaments if there be occasion at times when the Law dos not exact it they are plac'd as Sentinels and ought diligently to observe the motions of the Enemy and give notice of his approach But if the Sentinel falls asleep neglects his duty or maliciously endeavors to betray the City those who are concern'd may make use of all other means to know their danger and to preserve themselves The ignorance incapacity negligence or luxury of a King is a great calamity to a Nation and his malice is worse but not an irreparable ruin Remedys may be and often have bin found against the worst of their Vices The last  French  Kings of the Races of  Meroveus  and  Pepin  brought many mischiefs upon the Kingdom but the destruction was prevented  Edward  and  Richard  the Seconds of  England  were not unlike them and we know by what means the Nation was preserv'd The question was not who had the Right or who ought to call Parliaments but how the Commonwealth might be sav'd from ruin The Consuls or other chief Magistrats in  Rome  had certainly a right of assembling and dismissing the Senat But when  Hannibal  was at the Gates or any other imminent danger threaten'd them with destruction if that Magistrate had bin drunk mad or gain'd by the Enemy no wise man can think that formalitys were to have bin observ'd In such cases every Man is a Magistrate and he who best knows the danger and the means of preventing it has a right of calling the Senat or People to an Assembly The People would and certainly ought to follow him as they did  Brutus  and  Valerius  against  Tarquin  or  Horatius  and  Valerius  against the  Decemviri  and whoever should do otherwise might for sottishness be compar'd to the Courtiers of the two last Kings of  Spain  The first of these by name  Philip  the Third being indispos'd in cold weather a  Braziero  of Coals was brought into his Chamber and plac'd so near to him that he was cruelly scorch'd A Nobleman then present said to one who stood by him  The King burns  the other answer'd it was true but the Page whose Office it was to bring and remove  the  Braziero  was not there and before he could be found his Majesty's Legs and Face were so burnt that it caus'd an  Erysipelas  of which he dy'd  Philip  the Fourth escap'd not much better who being surpriz'd as he was hunting by a violent storm of Rain and Hail and no man presuming to lend the King a Cloke he was so wet before the Officer could be found who carry'd his own that he took a cold which cast him into a dangerous Fever If Kings like the consequences of such a Regularity they may cause it to be observ'd in their own Familys but Nations looking in the first place to their own safety would be guilty of the most extreme stupidity if they should suffer themselves to be ruin'd for adhering to such Ceremonys  This is said upon a supposition that the whole power of calling and dissolving Parliaments is by the Law plac'd in the King but I utterly deny that it is so and to prove it shall give the following Reasons  That the King can have no such Power unless it be given to him for every man is originally free and the same power that makes him King gives him all that belongs to his being King 'Tis not therefore an inherent but a delegated Power and whoever receives it is accountable to those that gave it for as our Author is forc'd to confess  they who give Authority by Commission do always retain more than they grant  The Law for annual Parliaments expresly declares it not to be in the King's power as to the point of their meeting nor consequently their continuance For they meet to no purpose if they may not continue to do the work for which they meet and it were absurd to give them a power of meeting if they might not continue till it be done For as  Grotius  says  Qui dat finem dat media ad finem necessaria  The only reason why Parliaments do meet is to provide for the publick good and they by Law ought to meet for that end They ought not therefore to be dissolv'd till it be accomplish'd For this reason the opinion given by  Tresilian  that Kings might dissolve Parliaments at their pleasure was adjudg'd to be a principal part of his Treason  We have already prov'd that  Saxons Danes Normans  c who had no Title to the Crown were made Kings by Micklegemots Wittenagemots and Parliaments that is either by the whole People or their Representatives Others have bin by the same Authority restrain'd brought to order or depos'd But as it is impossible that such as were not Kings and had no title to be Kings could by virtue of a kingly Power call Parliaments when they had none and absurd to think that such as were in the Throne who had not govern'd according to Law would suffer themselves to be restrain'd imprison'd or depos'd by Parliaments call'd and sitting by themselves and still depending upon their will to be or not to be 'Tis certain that Parliaments have in themselves a Power of sitting and acting for the publick Good  To the second The various customs us'd in Elections are nothing to this question In the Countys which make up the Body of the Nation all Freeholders have their Votes these are properly  Cives  Members of the Commonwealth in distinction from those who are only  Incolae  or Inhabitants Villains and such as being under their Parents are not yet  sui juris  These in the beginning of the  Saxons  reign in  England  compos'd the Micklegemots and when they grew to be fo numerous that one place could not contain them or so far dispers'd that without trouble and danger they could not leave their habitations they deputed such as should represent them When the Nation came to  be more polish'd to inhabit Citys and Towns and to set up several Arts and Trades those who exercis'd them were thought to be as useful to the Commonwealth as the Freeholders in the Country and to deserve the same Privileges But it not being reasonable that every one should in this case do what he pleas'd it was thought fit that the King with his Council which always consisted of the  Proceres  and  Magnates Regni  should judg what numbers of men and what places deserv'd to be made Corporations or Bodys Politick and to enjoy those Privileges by which he did not confer upon them any thing that was his but according to the trust repos'd in him did dispense out of the publick Stock parcels of what he had receiv'd from the whole Nation And whether this was to be enjoy'd by all the Inhabitants as in  Westminster  by the Common Hall as in  London  or by the Mayor Aldermen Jurats and Corporation as in other places 'tis the same thing for in all these cases the King dos only distribute not give and under the same condition that he might call Parliaments that is for the publick good This indeed increases the Honor of the person intrusted and adds weight to the obligation incumbent upon him but can never change the nature of the thing so as to make that an inherent which is only a delegated Power And as Parliaments when occasion requir'd have bin assembled have refus▪d to be dissolv'd till their work was finish'd have severely punish'd those who went about to persuade Kings that such matters depended absolutely upon their will and made Laws to the contrary 'tis not to be imagin'd that they would not also have interpos'd their Authority in matters of Charters if it had bin observ'd that any King had notoriously abus'd the trust repos'd in him and turn'd the Power to his private advantage with which he was intrusted for the publick good  That which renders this most plain and safe is that men chosen in this manner to serve in Parliament do not act by themselves but in conjunction with others who are sent thither by prescription nor by a Power deriv'd from Kings but from those that chuse them If it be true therefore that those who delegate Powers do always retain to themselves more than they give they who send these men do not give them an absolute power of doing whatsoever they please but retain to themselves more than they confer upon their Deputys They must therefore be accountable to their Principals contrary to what our Author asserts This continues in force tho he knows not that  any Knights and Burgesses have ever bin question'd by those that sent them  for it cannot be concluded they ought not or may not be question'd because none have bin question'd But in truth they are frequently question'd The People do perpetually judg of the behaviour of their Deputys Whensoever any of them has the misfortune not to satisfy the major part of those that chose him he is sure to be rejected with disgrace the next time he shall desire to be chosen This is not only a sufficient punishment for such faults as he who is but one of five hundred may probably commit but as much as the greatest and freest People of the World did ever inflict upon their Commanders that brought the greatest losses upon them  Appius Claudius Pomponius  and  Terentius Varro  surviv'd the greatest defeats that ever the  Romans  suffer'd and tho they had caus'd them by their folly and perversness were never punish'd Yet I think no man doubts that the  Romans  had as much right over their own Officers as the  Athenians  and  Carthaginians  who frequently put them to death They thought the mind of a Commander would be too much distracted if at the same time he should  stand in fear both of the Enemy and his own Countrymen And as they always endeavour'd to chuse the best men they would lay no other necessity upon them of performing their duty than what was suggested by their own vertue and love to their Country 'Tis not therefore to be thought strange if the people of  England  have follow'd the most generous and most prosperous Examples Besides if any thing has bin defective in their usual proceedings with their Delegats the inconvenience has bin repair'd by the modesty of the best and wisest of them that were chosen Many in all Ages and sometimes the whole body of the Commons have refus'd to give their opinion in some cases till they had consulted with those that sent them The House have bin often adjourn'd to give them time to do it and if this were done more frequently or that the Towns Citys and Countys had on some occasions given instructions to their Deputys matters would probably have gone better in Parliament than they have often done  The question is not whether the Parliament be impeccable or infallible but whether an Assembly of Nobility with a House of Commons compos'd of those who are best esteem'd by their Neighbors in all the Towns and Countys of  England  are more or less subject to error or corruption than such a man woman or child as happens to be next in blood to the last King Many men do usually see more than one and  Prov  if we may believe the wisest King  In the multitude of Counsellors there is safety  Such as are of mature Age good Experience and approv'd reputation for Vertue and Wisdom will probably judg better than children or fools Men are thought to be more fit for War than women and those who are bred up in Disciplin to understand it better than those who never knew any thing of it If some Countys or Citys fail to chuse such men as are eminently capable all will hardly be so mistaken as to chuse those who have no more of Wisdom or Vertue than is usually intail'd upon Familys But  Filmer  at a venture admires the profound Wisdom of the King tho besides such as we have known Historys give us too many proofs that all those who have bin possest of Crowns have not excel'd that way He speaks of Kings in general and makes no difference between  Solomon  and his foolish Son He distinguishes not our  Edward  the first from  Edward  the second  Edward  the third from  Richard  the second or  Henry  the fifth from  Henry  the sixth And because all of them were Kings all of them if he deserves credit must needs have bin endow'd with profound Wisdom  David  was wise as an Angel of God therefore the present Kings of  France Spain  and  Sweden  must have bin so also when they were but five years old  Joan  of  Castille  could not be mad nor the two  Joans  of  Naples  infamous Strumpets or all his Arguments fall to the ground For tho  Solomon  's Wisdom surpast that of all the people yet men could not rely equally upon that of  Rehoboam  unless it had bin equal And if they are all equal in Wisdom when they come to be equally Kings  Perses  of  Macedon  was as great a Captain as  Philip  or  Alexander Commodus  and  Heliogabalus  were as wise and vertuous as  Marcus Aurelius  and  Antoninus Pius  Nay  Christina  of  Sweden  in her infancy was as fit to command an Army as her valiant Father If this be most absurd and false there can be neither reason nor sense in proposing as our Author dos that the Power should be in the King because the Parliament is not infallible  It is  says he  for the Head to correct and not to expect the consent of the Members or Partys peccant to be Judges in their own cases nor is it needful to confine the King  c  Besides that this is directly contrary to his own fundamental Maxim that no man must be the Judg of his own case in as much as this would put the Power into the King's hands to decide the Controversys between himself and the people in which his own Passions private Interest and the corrupt Counsels of ill Ministers will always lead him out of the way of Justice the inconveniences that may arise from a possibility that the Parliament or People is not infallible will be turn'd to the most certain and destructive mischiefs as must have fallen out in  Spain  if upon a supposition that the Estates of  Castille  might err the correction of such Errors had bin left to the profound Wisdom and exquisit Judgment of  Joan  their Queen and Head who was stark mad And the like may be said of many other Princes who thro natural or accidental infirmitys want of age or dotage have bin utterly unable to judg of any thing  The matter will not be much mended tho I pass from Ideots and Lunaticks to such as know well enough how to clothe and feed themselves and to perform the ordinary functions of life and yet have bin as uncapable of giving a right judgment concerning the weighty matters of Government as the weakest of Children or the most furious of Madmen Good manners forbid me to enumerate the examples of this kind which  Europe  has produc'd even in this Age But I should commit a greater fault if I did in silence pass over the extravagances of those who being most weak in judgment and irregular in their appetites have bin most impatient of any restraint upon their will The brave  Gustavus Adolphus  and his Nephew  Carolus Gustavus  who was not inferior to him in Valor Wisdom and love to his people were content with the Power that the Laws of their Country gave to them But  Frederick  the fourth of  Denmark  never rested till he had overthrown the Liberty of that Nation  Casimir  by attempting the like in  Poland  lost almost half that Kingdom and flying from the other left all to be ravag'd by  Swedes Tartars  and  Cosacks  The present Emperor who pass'd his time in setting Songs in Musick with a wretched Italian Eunuch when he ought to have bin at the Head of a brave Army rais'd to oppose the Turks in the year and which under good conduct might have overthrown the Ottoman Empire as soon as he was deliver'd from the fear of that Enemy fell upon his own Subjects with such cruelty that they are now forc'd to fly to the Turks for protection the Protestants especially who find their condition more tolerable under those profest Enemys to Christianity than to be expos'd to the pride avarice perfidiousness and violence of the Jesuits by whom he is govern'd And the qualitys of the King of  Portugal  are so well known together with the condition to which he would have brought his Kingdom if he had not bin sent to the  Tercera  's that I need not speak particularly of him  If Kings therefore by virtue of their Office are constituted Judges over the body of their People because the People or Parliaments representing them are not infallible those Kings who are children fools disabled by age or madmen are so also women have the same right where they are admitted to the succession those men who tho of ripe age and not superannuated nor directly fools or madmen yet absolutely uncapable of judging important Affairs or by their passions interests vices or the malice and wickedness of their Ministers Servants and Favorites are set to oppress and ruin the people enjoy the same privilege than which nothing can be imagin'd more absurd and abominable nor more directly tending to the corruption and destruction of the Nations  under them for whose good and safety our Author confesses they have their power  SECT XXXIX Those Kings only are heads of the People who are good wise and seek to advance no Interest but that of the Publick  THE worst of men seldom arrive to such a degree of impudence as plainly to propose the most mischievous follys and enormitys They who are enemys to Vertue and fear not God are afraid of men and dare not offer such things as the world will not bear lest by that means they should overthrow their own designs All poison must be disguis'd and no man can be persuaded to eat Arsenic unless it be cover'd with something that appears to be harmless  Creusa  would have abhor'd  Medea  's present if the pestilent venom had not bin hidden by the exterior lustre of Gold and Gems The Garment that destroy'd  Hercules  appear'd beautiful and  Eve  had neither eaten of the forbidden Tree nor given the Fruit to her Husband if it had not seem'd to be good and pleasant and she had not bin induc'd to believe that by eating it they should both be as Gods The Servants of the Devil have always follow'd the same method their malice is carry'd on by fraud and they have seldom destroy'd any but such as they had first deceiv'd Truth can never conduce to mischief and is best discover'd by plain words but nothing is more usual with ill men than to cover their mischievous designs with figurative phrases It would be too ridiculous to say in plain terms that all Kings without distinction are better able to judg of all matters than any or all their people they must therefore be call'd  the Head  that thereby they may be invested with all the preeminences which in a natural body belong to that part and men must be made to believe the analogy between the natural and political body to be perfect But the matter must be better examin'd before this mortal poison seems fit to be swallow'd  The word  Head  is figuratively us'd both in Scripture and profane Authors in several senses in relation to places or persons and always implys something of real or seeming preeminence in point of honor or jurisdiction Thus  Damascus  is said to be the head of  Syria Samaria  of  Ephraim  and  Ephraim  of the ten Tribes that is  Ephraim  was the chief  Chron  Tribe  Samaria  was the chief City of  Ephraim  and  Damascus  of  Syria  tho it be certain that  Ephraim  had no jurisdiction over the other Tribes nor  Samaria  over the other Citys of  Ephraim  but every one according to the Law had an equal power within it self or the Territorys belonging to it and no privileges were granted to one above another except to  Jerusalem  in the matter of Religion because the Temple was plac'd there  The words Head Prince principal Man or Captain seem also to be equivocal and in this sense the same men are call'd Heads of the Tribes Princes in the houses of their Fathers and 'tis said that two hundred Heads of the Tribe of  Reuben  were carry'd away captive by  Tiglath Pilezer  and proportionably in the other Tribes which were a strange thing if the word did imply that supreme absolute and infinite Power that our Author attributes to it and no man of less understanding  than he can comprehend how there should be two hundred or more sovereign unlimited Powers in one Tribe most especially when 'tis certain that one series of Kings had for many Ages reign'd over that Tribe and nine more and that every one of those Tribes as well as the particular Citys even from their first entrance into the promis'd Land had a full jurisdiction within it self When the  Gileadites  came to  Jephtha  he suspected them and ask'd whether indeed they intended to make him  Judg  their Head they answer'd if he would lead them against the  Ammonites  he should be their Head In the like sense when  Jul Caesar  in despair would have kill'd himself one of his Soldiers dissuaded him from that design by telling him  Cum tot ab hac anima populorum vita salus{que}  Pendeat tantus caput hoc sibi fecerit orbis  Savitia est voluisse mori  Lucan  That the safety of so many Nations that had made him their Head depending upon his life it would be cruelty in him to take such a resolution  But for all that when this Head was taken off the Body did still subsist upon which I observe many fundamental differences between the relation of this figurative Head even when the word is rightly apply'd and that of the natural Head to their respective Bodys  The figurative Heads may be many the natural but one  The People make or create the figurative Head the natural is from it self or connate with the Body  The natural Body cannot change or subsist without the natural Head but a People may change and subsist very well without the artificial Nay if it had bin true that the World had chosen  Cesar  as it was not for he was chosen only by a factious mercenory Army and the soundest part so far oppos'd that Election that they brought him to think of killing himself there could have bin no truth in this flattering assertion  That the safety of the whole depended upon his Life  for the World could not only subsist without him but without any such Head as it had done before he by the help of his corrupted Soldiery had usurp'd the Power which also shews that a civil Head may be a matter of convenience but not of necessity Many Nations have had none and if the expression be so far stretch'd as to make it extend to the annual or temporary Magistrats set up by the  Athenians Carthaginians Romans  and other antient Commonwealths or to those at this day in  Venice Holland Switzerland  and other places it must be confest that the People who made depos'd abrogated or abolish'd both the Magistrats and Magistracys had the power of framing directing and removing their Heads which our Author will say is most absurd Yet they did it without any prejudice to themselves and very often much to their advantage  In mentioning these vast and essential differences between the natural and political Head I no way intend to exclude others that may be of equal weight but as all figurative expressions have their strength only from similitude there can be little or none in this which differs in so many important points and can therefore be of no effect  However Right proceeds from identity and not from similitude The right of a man over me is by being my Father and not by being like my Father If I had a Brother so perfectly resembling me as to deceive our Parents which has sometimes happen'd to Twins it could give him no right to any thing that is mine If the power therefore of correcting the partys peccant which our Author attributes to Kings be grounded  upon the name of Head and a resemblance between the Heads of the Body politick and Body natural if this resemblance be found to be exceedingly imperfect uncertain or perhaps no way relating to the matter in question or tho it did and were absolutely perfect could confer no right the allegation of it is impertinent and absurd  This being clear'd 'tis time to examin what the Office of the Head is in a natural Body that we may learn from thence why that name is sometimes given to those who are eminent in political Bodys and to whom it dos belong  Some men account the Head to be so absolutely the seat of all the Senses as to derive even that of feeling which is exercis'd in every part from the Brain but I think 'tis not doubted that all the rest have both their seat and function in the Head and whatsoever is useful or hurtful to a man is by them represented to the understanding as  Aristotle  says  Nihil est in intellectu quod non sit prius in sensu  This is properly the part of every Magistrate He is the Sentinel of the Publick and is to represent what he discovers beneficial or hurtful to the Society which Office belongs not only to the supreme but proportionably to the subordinate In this sense were the chief men among the  Israelites  call'd  Heads  Chron  of their Fathers house choice and mighty men of valor chief of the Princes  And in the following Chapter mention is made of  nine hundred and fifty Benjamites chief men in the House of their Fathers  These men exercis'd a charitable care over such as were inferior to them in power and valor without any shadow of sovereignty or possibility that there could be so many Sovereigns and such as were under their care are said to be their Brethren which is not a word of majesty and domination but of dearness and equality The name therefore of Head may be given to a Sovereign but it implys nothing of sovereignty and must be exercis'd with charity which always terminates in the good of others The Head cannot correct or chastise the proper work of that part is only to indicate and he who takes upon him to do more is not the Head A natural body is homogeneous and cannot subsist if it be not so We cannot take one part of a Horse another of a Bear and put upon them the head of a Lion for it would be a Monster that would have neither action nor life The Head must be of the same nature with the other Members or it cannot subsist But the Lord or Master differs  in specie  from his Servants and Slaves he is not therefore properly their Head  Besides the Head cannot have a subsistence without the Body nor any interest contrary to that of the Body and 'tis impossible for any thing to be good for the Head that is hurtful to the Body A Prince therefore or Magistrate who sets up an interest in himself distinct from or repugnant to that of the people renounces the title or quality of their Head Indeed  Moses  was the Head of the  Israelites  for when God threaten'd to destroy that People and promis'd to make him a great Nation he wav'd the particular advantages offer'd to himself interceded for them and procur'd their pardon Yet he was not able to bear the weight of the Government alone but desir'd that some might be appointed to assist him  Gideon  was the Head of the same people but he would not reign himself nor suffer his Sons to reign over them  Samuel  was also their Head he took nothing from any man defrauded none took bribes from no man opprest none God and the People were his witnesses He blam'd them for their Rebellion against God in asking a King but was no way concern'd for himself or his Family  David  likewise had a right to that Title for  he desir'd that God would spare the People and turn the effect of his anger against himself and the house of his Father But  Rehoboam  was not their Head for tho he acknowledg'd that his Father had laid a heavy yoke upon them yet he told them he would add to the weight and that if his Father had chastis'd them with Whips he would chastise them with Scorpions The Head is no burden to the Body and can lay none upon it the Head cannot chastise any member and he who dos so be it more or less cannot be the Head  Jeroboam  was not the Head of the revolting Tribes for the Head takes care of the Members and provides for the safety of the whole But he thro fear that the people going to  Jerusalem  to worship should return to the house of  David  by setting up Idols to secure his own interests drew guilt and destruction upon them Tho it should be granted that  Augustus  by a gentle use of his power had in a manner expiated the detestable Villanys committed in the acquisition and had truly deserv'd to be call'd the Head of the  Romans  yet that title could no way belong to  Caligula Claudius Nero  or  Vitellius  who neither had the qualitys requir'd in the Head nor the understanding or will to perform the office Nay if I should carry the matter farther and acknowledg that  Brutus Cincinnatus Fabius Camillus  and others who in the time of their annual or shorter Magistracys had by their vigilance vertue and care to preserve the City in safety and to provide for the publick good perform'd the office of the Head and might deserve the name I might justly deny it to the greatest Princes that have bin in the world who having their power for life and leaving it to descend to their children have wanted the Vertues requir'd for the performance of their duty And I should less fear to be guilty of an absurdity in saying that a Nation might every year change its Head than that he can be the Head who cares not for the Members nor understands the things that conduce to their good most especially if he sets up an Interest in himself against them It cannot be said that these are imaginary cases and that no Prince dos these things for the proof is too easy and the examples too numerous  Caligula  could not have wish'd the  Romans  but one Head that he might cut it off at once if he had bin that Head and had advanc'd no Interest contrary to that of the Members  Nero  had not burnt the City of  Rome  if his concernments had bin inseparably united to those of the people He who caus'd above three hundred thousand of his innocent unarm'd Subjects to be murder'd and fill'd his whole Kingdom with fire and blood did set up a personal Interest repugnant to that of the Nation and no better testimony can be requir'd to shew that he did so than a Letter written by his Son to take off the penalty due to one of the chief Ministers of those crueltys for this reason that what he had done was  by the command and for the service of his Royal Father  King  John  did not pursue the advantage of his people when he endeavour'd to subject them to the Pope or the  Moors  And whatever Prince seeks assistance from foreign Powers or makes Leagues with any stranger or enemy for his own advantage against his people however secret the Treaty may be declares himself not to be the Head but an enemy to them The Head cannot stand in need of an exterior help against the Body nor subsist when divided from it He therefore that courts such an assistance divides himself from the Body and if he dos subsist it must be by a lise he has in himself distinct from that of the Body which the Head cannot have  But besides these enormitys that testify the most wicked rage and fury in the highest degree there is another practice which no man that knows the world can deny to be common with Princes and incompatible with the nature of a Head The Head cannot desire to draw all the nourishment of the Body to it self nor more than a due proportion If the rest of the parts are sick weak or cold the Head suffers equally with them and if they perish must perish also Let this be compar'd with the actions of many Princes we know and we shall soon see which of them are Heads of their people If the Gold brought from the  Indys  has bin equally distributed by the Kings of  Spain  to the body of that Nation I consent they may be call'd the Heads If the Kings of  France  assume no more of the Riches of that great Kingdom than their due proportion let them also wear that honourable name But if the naked backs and empty bellys of their miserable Subjects evince the contrary it can by no means belong to them If those great Nations wast and languish if nothing be so common in the best Provinces belonging to them as misery famin and all the effects of the most outrageous oppression whilst their Princes and Favorites possess such treasures as the most wanton prodigality cannot exhaust if that which is gain'd by the sweat of so many millions of men be torn out of the mouths of their starving Wives and Children to foment the vices of those luxurious Courts or reward the Ministers of their lusts the nourishment is not distributed equally to all the parts of the Body the oeconomy of the whole is overthrown and they who do these things cannot be the Heads nor parts of the Body but something distinct from and repugnant to it 'Tis not therefore he who is found in or advanc'd to the place of the Head who is truly the Head 'Tis not he who ought but he who dos perform the office of the Head that deserves the name and privileges belonging to the Head If our Author therefore will persuade us that any King is Head of his People he must do it by Arguments peculiarly relating to him since those in general are found to be false If he say that the King as King may direct or correct the people and that the power of determining all controversys must be refer'd to him because they may be mistaken he must show that the King is infallible for unless he dos so the wound is not cur'd This also must be by some other way than by saying he is their Head for such Powers belong not to the office of the Head and we see that all Kings do not deserve that Name Many of them want both understanding and will to perform the functions of the Head and many act directly contrary in the whole course of their Government If any therefore among them have merited the glorious name of Heads of Nations it must have bin by their personal Vertues by a vigilant care of the good of their People by an inseparable conjunction of interests with them by an ardent love to every member of the Society by a moderation of spirit affecting no undue Superiority or assuming any singular advantage which they are not willing to communicate to every part of the political Body He who finds this merit in himself will scorn all the advantages that can be drawn from misapply'd names He that knows such honor to be peculiarly due to him for being the best of Kings will never glory in that which may be common to him with the worst Nay whoever pretends by such general discourses as these of our Author to advance the particular Interests of any one King dos either know he is of no merit and that nothing can be said for him which will not as well agree with the worst of men or cares not what he says so he may do mischief  and is well enough contented that he who is set up by such Maxims as a publick plague may fall in the ruin he brings upon the people  SECT XL Good Laws prescribe easy and safe Remedys against the Evils proceeding from the vices or infirmitys of the Magistrate and when they fail they must be supply'd  THOSE who desire to advance the power of the Magistrate above the Law would persuade us that the difficultys and dangers of inquiring into his actions or opposing his will when employ'd in violence and injustice are so great that the remedy is always worse than the disease and that 'tis better to suffer all the evils that may proceed from his infirmitys and vices than to hazard the consequences of displeasing him But on the contrary I think and hope to prove  That in well▪constituted Governments the remedys against ill Magistrats are easy and safe  That 'tis good as well for the Magistrate as the People so to constitute the Government that the Remedys may be easy and safe  That how dangerous and difficult soever they may be thro the defects of the first Constitution they must be try'd  To the first 'Tis most evident that in wellregulated Governments these Remedys have bin found to be easy and safe The Kings of  Sparta  were not suffer'd in the least to deviate from the rule of the Law And  Theopompus  one of those Kings in whose time the  Ephori  were created and the regal Power much restrain'd doubted not to affirm that it was by  Plutarch  that means become more lasting and more secure  Pausanias  had not the name of King but commanded in the War against  Xerxes  with more than regal Power nevertheless being grown insolent he was without any trouble to that State banish'd and afterwards put to death  Leonidas  Father of  Cleomenes  was in the like manner banish'd The second  Agis  was most unjustly put to death by the  Ephori  for he was a brave and a good Prince but there was neither danger nor difficulty in the action Many of the  Roman  Magistrats after the expulsion of the Kings seem to have bin desirous to extend their Power beyond the bounds of the Law and perhaps some others as well as the  Decemviri  may have design'd an absolute Tyranny but the first were restrain'd and the others without much difficulty supprest Nay even the Kings were so well kept in order that no man ever pretended to the Crown unless he were chosen nor made any other use of his Power than the Law permitted except the last  Tarquin  who by his insolence avarice and cruelty brought ruin upon himself and his family I have already mention'd one or two Dukes of  Venice  who were not less ambitious but their crimes return'd upon their own heads and they perish'd without any other danger to the State than what had pass'd before their Treasons were discover'd Infinite examples of the like nature may be alledg'd and if matters have not at all times and in all places succeeded in the same manner it has bin because the same courses were  not every where taken for all things do so far follow their causes that being order'd in the same manner they will always produce the same effects  To the second Such a regulation of the magistratical Power is not at all grievous to a good Magistrate He who never desires to do any thing but what he ought cannot desire a Power of doing what he ought not nor be troubled to find he cannot do that which he would not do if he could This inability is also advantageous to those who are evil or unwise that since they cannot govern themselves a Law may be impos'd upon them lest by following their own irregular will they bring destruction upon themselves their familys and people as many have done If  Apollo  in the Fable had not bin too indulgent to  Phaeton  in granting his ill conceiv'd request the furious Youth had not brought a necessity upon  Jupiter  either of destroying him or suffering the world to be destroy'd by him  Besides good and wise men know the weight of Sovereign Power and misdoubt their own strength Sacred and human Historys furnish us with many examples of those who have fear'd the lustre of a Crown Men that find in themselves no delight in doing mischief know not what thoughts may insinuate into their minds when rais'd too much above their Sphere They who were able to bear adversity have bin precipitated into ruin by prosperity When the Prophet told  Hazael  the Villanys he would commit he answer'd  Is thy Servant a dog that I should do these things  but yet he did them I know not where to find an example of a man more excellently qualify'd than  Alexander  of  Macedon  but he sell under the weight of his own fortune and grew to exceed those in vice whom he had conquer'd by his vertue The nature of man can hardly suffer such violent changes without being disorder'd by them and every one ought to enter into a just diffidence of himself and fear the temptations that have destroy'd so many If any man be so happily born so carefully educated so establish'd in vertue that no storm can shake him nor any poison corrupt him yet he will consider he is mortal and knowing no more than  Solomon  whether his Son shall be a wise man or a fool he will always fear to take upon him a power which must prove a most pestilent evil both to the person that has it and to those that are under it as soon as it shall fall into the hands of one who either knows not how to use it or may be easily drawn to abuse it Supreme Magistrats always walk in obscure and slippery places but when they are advanc'd so high that no one is near enough to support direct or restrain them their fall is inevitable and mortal And those Nations that have wanted the prudence rightly to balance the powers of their Magistrats were frequently oblig'd to have recourse to the most violent remedys and with much difficulty danger and blood to punish the crimes which they might have prevented On the other side such as have bin more wise in the constitution of their Governments have always had regard to the frailty of human nature and the corruption reigning in the hearts of men and being less liberal of the power over their lives and libertys have reserv'd to themselves so much as might keep their Magistrats within the limits of the Law and oblige them to perform the ends of their Institution And as the Law which denounces severe penaltys for crimes is indeed merciful both to ill men who are by that means deter▪d from committing them and to the good who otherwise vvould be destroy'd so those Nations  that have kept the reins in their hands have by the same act provided as well for the safety of their Princes as for their own They who know the Law is well defended seldom attempt to subvert it they are not easily tempted to run into excesses when such bounds are set as may not safely be transgrest and whilst they are by these means render'd more moderate in the exercise of their Power the People are exempted from the odious necessity of suffering all manner of indignitys and miserys from their Princes or by their destruction to prevent or avenge them  To the third If these Rules have not bin well observ'd in the first constitution or from the changes of times corruption of manners insensible encroachments or violent usurpations of Princes have bin render'd ineffectual and the People expos'd to all the calamitys that may be brought upon them by the weakness vices and malice of the Prince or those who govern him I confess the remedys are more difficult and dangerous but even in those cases they must be try'd Nothing can be fear'd that is worse than what is suffer'd or must in a short time fall upon those who are in this condition They who are already fallen into all that is odious shameful and miserable cannot justly fear When things are brought to such a pass the boldest counsels are the most safe and if those must  Moriendum victis moriendum deditis id solum interest an inter cruciatus ludibria an per virtutem expiremus  C Tacit  Quod si nocentes innocentes{que} idem exitus maneat acrioris viri est merit  perire  Ibid  perish who lie still and they can but perish who are most active the choice is easily made Let the danger be never so great there is a possibility of safety whilst men have life hands arms and courage to use them but that People must certainly perish who tamely suffer themselves to be opprest either by the injustice cruelty and malice of an ill Magistrate or by those who prevail upon the vices and infirmitys of weak Princes 'Tis in vain to say that this may give occasion to men of raising tumults or civil war for tho these are evils yet they are not the greatest of evils Civil War in  Macchiavel  's account is a Disease but Tyranny is the Death of a State Gentle ways are first to be us'd and 'tis best if the work can be done by them but it must not be left undone if they fail 'Tis good to use supplications advices and remonstrances but those who have no regard to Justice and will not hearken to Counsel must be constrain'd 'Tis folly to deal otherwise with a man who will not be guided by Reason and a Magistrate who despises the Law or rather to think him a man who rejects the essential principle of a man or to account him a Magistrate who overthrows the Law by which he is a Magistrate This is the last result but those Nations must come to it which cannot otherwise be preserv'd  Nero  's madness was not to be cur'd nor the mischievous effects of it any otherwise to be supprest than by his death He who had spar'd such a Monster when it was in his power to remove him had brought destruction upon the whole Empire and by a foolish clemency made himself the Author of his future villanys This would have bin yet more clear if the World had then bin in such a temper as to be capable of an intire liberty But the antient foundations had bin overthrown and nothing better could be built upon the new than something that might in part resist that torrent of iniquity which had overflow'd the best part of the World and give Mankind a little time to breath under a less barbarous Master Yet all the best men did join in the work that was then to be done tho they knew it would prove  but imperfect The Sacred History is not without examples of this kind When  Ahab  had subverted the Law set up false Witnesses and corrupt Judges to destroy the innocent kill'd the Prophets and establish'd Idolatry his house must then be cut off and his blood be lick'd up by dogs When matters are brought to this pass the decision is easy The question is only Whether the punishment of crimes shall fall upon one or a few Persons who are guilty of them or upon a whole Nation that is innocent If the Father may not dy for the Son nor the Son for the Father but every one must bear the penalty of his own crimes it would be most absurd to punish the People for the guilt of Princes When the Earl of  Morton  was sent Embassador to Q  Elizabeth  by the Estates of  Scotland  to justify their proceedings against  Mary  their Queen whom they had oblig'd to renounce the Government he alledg'd amongst other things the murder of her Husband plainly prov'd against her asserted the antient Right and Custom of that Kingdom of  Animadvertendi in reges  examining the actions of their Kings by which means he said many had bin  Morte vinculis exilio puniti  Bu  an  S  t l    Qui

whole matter concluded that if she was still permitted to live it was not on account of her innocence or any exemption from the penaltys of the Law but from the mercy and clemency of the People who contenting themselves with a resignation of her Right and Power to her Son had spar'd her This Discourse which is set down at large by the Historian cited on the Margin being of such strength in it self as never to have bin any otherwise answer'd than by railing and no way disapprov'd by Queen  Elizabeth  or her Council to whom it was made either upon a general account of the pretensions of Princes to be exempted from the penaltys of the Law or any pretext that they had particularly misapply'd them in relation to their Queen I may justly say that when Nations fall under such Princes as are either utterly uncapable of making a right use of their Power or do maliciously abuse that Authority with which they are entrusted those Nations stand oblig'd by the duty they owe to themselves and their posterity to use the best of their endeavors to remove the evil whatever danger or difficultys they may meet with in the performance  Pontius  the  Samnite  said as truly as bravely to his Countrymen That  Justa pia{que} sunt arma quibus necessaria necessaria quib  n  lla n  i in armis spes est salut  s  T  lib  those Arms were just and pious that were necessary and necessary when there was no hope of safety by any other way  This is the voice of Mankind and is dislik'd only by those Princes who fear the deserv'd punishments that may fall upon them or by their Servants and Flatterers who being for the most part the authors of their crimes think they shall be involv'd in their ruin  SECT XLI The People for whom and by whom the Magistrate is created can only judg whether he rightly perform his Office or not  'TIS commonly said that no man ought to be the Judg of his own case and our Author lays much weight upon it as a fundamental Maxim tho according to his ordinary inconstancy he overthrows it in the case of Kings where it ought to take place if in any for it often falls out that no men are less capable of forming a right judgment than they Their passions and interests are most powerful to disturb or pervert them No men are so liable to be diverted from Justice by the flatterys of corrupt Servants They never act as Kings except for those by whom and for whom they are created and acting for others the account of their actions cannot depend upon their own will Nevertheless I am not afraid to say that naturally and properly a man is the judg of his own concernments No one is or can be depriv'd of this privilege unless by his own consent and for the good of that Society into which he enters This Right therefore must necessarily belong to every man in all cases except only such as relate to the good of the Community for whose sake he has devested himself of it If I find my self afflicted with hunger thirst weariness cold heat or sickness 'tis a folly to tell me I ought not to seek meat drink rest shelter refreshment or physick because I must not be the judg of my own case The like may be said in relation to my house land or estate I may do what I please with them if I bring no damage upon others But I must not set fire to my house by which my Neighbour's house may be burnt I may not erect Forts upon my own Lands or deliver them to a foreign Enemy who may by that means infest my Country I may not cut the Banks of the Sea or those of a River lest my Neighbour's Ground be overflown because the Society into which I am incorporated would by such means receive prejudice My Land is not simply my own but upon condition that I shall not thereby bring damage upon the Publick by which I am protected in the peaceable enjoyment and innocent use of what I possess But this Society leaves me a liberty to take Servants and put them away at my pleasure No man is to direct me of what quality or number they shall be or can tell me whether I am well or ill serv'd by them Nay the State takes no other cognizance of what passes between me and them than to oblige me to perform the contracts I make and not to do that to them which the Law forbids that is to say the Power to which I have submitted my self exercises that jurisdiction over me which was establish'd by my consent and under which I enjoy all the benefits of Life which are of more advantage to me than my Liberty could have bin if I had retain'd it wholly in my self The nature also and measure of this submission must be determin'd by the reasons that induc'd me to it The Society in which I live cannot subsist unless by rule the equality in which men are born is so perfect that no man will suffer his natural Liberty to be abridg'd except others do the like I cannot reasonably expect to be defended from wrong unless I oblige my sel  to do none or to suffer the punishment prescrib'd by the Law if I perform not  my engagement But without prejudice to the Society into which I enter I may and do retain to my self the Liberty of doing what I pleasein all things relating peculiarly to my self or in which I am to seek my own convenience  Now if a private man is not subject to the judgment of any other than those to whom he submits himself for his own safety and convenience and notwithstanding that submission still retains to himself the right of ordering according to his own will all things merely relating to himself and of doing what he pleases in that which he dos for his own sake the same right must more certainly belong to whole Nations When a controversy happens between  Caius  and  Seius  in a matter of Right neither of them may determin the cause but it must be refer'd to a Judg superior to both not because 'tis not fit that a man should be judg of his own case but because they have both an equal Right and neither of them ows any subjection to the other But if there be a contest between Me and my Servant concerning my Service I only am to decide it He must serve me in my own way or be gone if I think fit tho he serves me never so well and I do him no wrong in putting him away if either I intend to keep no Servant or find that another will please me better I cannot therefore stand in need of a Judg unless the contest be with one who lives upon an equal foot with me No man can be my Judg unless he be my Superior and he cannot be my Superior who is not so by my consent nor to any other purpose than I consent to This cannot be the case of a Nation which can have no equal within it self Controversys may arise with other Nations the decision of which may be left to Judges chosen by mutual agreement but this relates not to our Question A Nation and most especially one that is powerful cannot recede from its own Right as a private man from the knowledg of his own weakness and inability to defend himself must come under the protection of a greater Power than his own The strength of a Nation is not in the Magistrate but the strength of a Magistrate is in the Nation The wisdom industry and valor of a Prince may add to the glory and greatness of a Nation but the foundation and substance will always be in it self If the Magistrate and People were upon equal terms as  Caius  and  Seius  receiving equal and mutual advantages from each other no man could be judg of their differences but such as they should set up for that end This has bin done by many Nations The antient  Germans  refer'd the decision of the most difficult matters to their Priests the  Gauls  and  Britans  to the  Druides  the  Mahometans  for some Ages to the Califs of  Babylon  the  Saxons  in  England  when they had embrac'd the Christian Religion to their Clergy Whilst all  Europe  lay under the Popish Superstition the decision of such matters was frequently assum'd by the Pope men often submitted to his judgment and the Princes that resisted were for the most part excommunicated depos'd and destroy'd All this was done for the same reasons These men were accounted holy and inspir'd and the Sentence pronounc'd by them was usually reverenc'd as the Judgment of God who was thought to direct them and all those who refus'd to submit were esteem'd execrable But no man or number of men as I think at the institution of a Magistrate did ever say If any difference happen between you or your Successors and us it be shall determin'd by your self or by them whether they be men women children mad foolish or vicious Nay if any such thing had bin  the folly turpitude and madness of such a sanction or stipulation must necessarily have destroy'd it But if no such thing was ever known or could have no effect if it had bin in any place 'tis most absurd to impose it upon all The People therefore cannot be depriv'd of their natural rights upon a frivolous pretence to that which never was and never can be They who create Magistracys and give to them such name form and power as they think fit do only know whether the end for which they were created be perform'd or not They who give a being to the power which had none can only judg whether it be employ'd to their welfare or turn'd to their ruin They do not set up one or a few men that they and their posterity may live in splendor and greatness but that Justice may be administer'd Vertue establish'd and provision made for the publick safety No wise man will think this can be done if those who set themselves to overthrow the Law are to be their own Judges If  Caligula Nero Vitellius Domitian  or  Heliogabalus  had bin subject to no other judgment they would have compleated the destruction of the Empire If the disputes between  Durstus Evenus  the third  Dardannus  and other Kings of  Scotland  with the Nobility and People might have bin determin'd by themselves they had escap'd the punishments they suffer'd and ruin'd the Nation as they design'd Other methods were taken they perish'd by their madness better Princes were brought into their places and their Successors were by their example admonish'd to avoid the ways that had prov'd fatal to them If  Edward  the second of  England  with  Gaveston  and the  Spencers Richard  the second with  Tresilian  and  Vere  had bin permitted to be the Judges of their own cases they who had murder'd the best of the Nobility would have pursu'd their designs to the destruction of such as remain'd the enslaving of the Nation the subversion of the Constitution and the establishment of a mere Tyranny in the place of a mix'd Monarchy But our Ancestors took better measures They who had felt the smart of the vices and follys of their Princes knew what remedys were most fit to be apply'd as well as the best time of applying them They found the effects of extreme corruption in Government to be so desperately pernicious that Nations must necessarily perish unless it be corrected and the State reduc'd to its first principle or alter'd Which being the case it was as easy for them to judg whether the Governor who had introduc'd that corruption should be brought to order or remov'd if he would not be reclaim'd or whether he should be suffer'd to ruin them and their posterity as it is for me to judg whether I should put away my Servant if I knew he intended to poison or murder me and had a certain facility of accomplishing his design or whether I should continue him in my service till he had perform'd it Nay the matter is so much the more plain on the side of the Nation as the disproportion of merit between a whole people and one or a few men entrusted with the power of governing them is greater than between a private man and his servant This is so fully confirm'd by the general consent of mankind that we know no Government that has not frequently either bin alter'd in form or reduc'd to its original purity by changing the familys or persons who abus'd the power with which they had bin entrusted Those who have wanted Wisdom and Vertue rightly and seasonably to perform this have bin soon destroy'd like the  Goths  in  Spain  who by omitting to curb the  Mariana  fury of  Witza  and  Rodrigo  in time became a prey to the  Moors  Their Kingdom by this means destroy'd was never restor'd and the remainder  of that Nation joining with the  Spaniards  whom they had kept in subjection for three or four Ages could not in less than eight hundred years expel those enemys they might have kept out only by removing two base and vitious Kings Such Nations as have bin so corrupted that when they have apply'd themselves to seek remedys to the evils they suffer'd by wicked Magistrats could not fall upon such as were proportionable to the disease have only vented their Passions in destroying the immediate instruments of their oppression or for a while delay'd their utter ruin But the root still remaining it soon produc'd the same poisonous fruit and either quite destroy'd or made them languish in perpetual misery The  Roman  Empire was the most eminent example of the first many of the monsters that had tyranniz'd over them were kill'd but the greatest advantage gain'd by their death was a respite from ruin and the Government which ought to have bin establish'd by good Laws depending only upon the Vertue of one man his Life prov'd to be no more than a lucid interval and at his death they relaps'd into the depth of Infamy and Misery and in this condition they continu'd till that Empire was totally subverted  All the Kingdoms of the  Arabians Medes Persians Moors  and others of the East are of the other sort Common sense instructs them that barbarous pride cruelty and madness grown to extremity cannot be born but they have no other way than to kill the Tyrant and to do the like to his Successor if he falls into the same crimes Wanting that Wisdom and Valor which is requir'd for the institution of a good Government they languish in perpetual slavery and propose to themselves nothing better than to live under a gentle Master which is but a precarious life and little to be valu'd by men of bravery and spirit But those Nations that are more generous who set a higher value upon Liberty and better understand the ways of preserving it think it a small matter to destroy a Tyrant unless they can also destroy the Tyranny They endeavour to do the work thorowly either by changing the Government intirely or reforming it according to the first institution and making such good Laws as may preserve its integrity when reform'd This has bin so frequent in all the Nations both antient and modern with whose actions we are best acquainted as appears by the foregoing examples and many others that might be alledg'd if the case were not clear that there is not one of them which will not furnish us with many instances and no one Magistracy now in being which dos not owe its original to some Judgment of this nature So that they must either derive their right from such actions or confess they have none at all and leave the Nations to their original Liberty of setting up those Magistracys which best please themselves without any restriction or obligation to regard one person or family more than another  SECT XLII The Person that wears the Crown cannot determin the Affairs which the Law refers to the King  OUR Author with the rest of the vulgar seems to have bin led into gross errors by the form of Writs summoning persons to appear before the King The common stile us'd in the trial of Delinquents the name of the King's Witnesses given to those who accuse them the Verdicts brought in by Jurys  coram domino Rege  and the prosecution made in the King's name seem to have caus'd this And they who understand not these Phrases render the Law a heap of the most gross absurditys and the King an Enemy to every one of his Subjects when he ought to be a Father to them all since without any particular consideration or examination of what any Witness deposes in a Court of Justice tending to the death confiscation or other punishment of any man he is call'd the King's Witness whether he speak the truth or a lie and on that account favor'd 'Tis not necessary to alledg many instances in a case that is so plain but it may not be amiss to insert two or three of the most important reasons to prove my assertion  If the Law did intend that he or she who wears the Crown should in his or her person judg all causes and determin the most difficult questions it mnst like our Author presume that they will always be of profound wisdom to comprehend all of them and of perfect integrity always to act according to their understanding Which is no less than to lay the foundation of the Government upon a thing merely contingent that either never was or very often fails as is too much verify'd by experience and the Historys of all Nations or else to refer the decision of all to those who thro the infirmitys of age sex or person are often uncapable of judging the least or subject to such passions and vices as would divert them from Justice tho they did understand it both which seem to be almost equally preposterous  The Law must also presume that the Prince is always present in all the places where his name is us'd The King of  France  is as I have said already esteem'd to be present  Sur son lit de justice  on the seat of Justice  in all the Parliaments and sovereign Courts of the Kingdom and if his corporeal Presence were by that phrase to be understood he must be in all those distinct and far distant places at the same time which absurdity can hardly be parallel'd unless by the Popish opinion of  Transubstantiation  But indeed they are so far from being guilty of such monstrous absurdity that he cannot in person be present at any trial and no man can be judg'd if he be This was plainly asserted to  Lewis  the  th  when he would have bin at the Trial of the Duke of  Candale  by the President  de Bellievre  who told him that as he could judg no man himself so they could not judg any if he were present upon which he retir'd  The Laws of most Kingdoms giving to Kings the Confiscation of Delinquents estates if they in their own persons might give judgment upon them they would be constituted both Judges and Partys which besides the foremention'd incapacitys to which Princes are as much subject as other men would tempt them by their own personal interest to subvert all manner of Justice  This therefore not being the meaning of the Law we are to inquire what it is and the thing is so plain that we cannot mistake unless we do it wilfully Some name must be us'd in all manner of Transactions and in matters of publick concernment none can be so fit as that of the principal Magistrate Thus are Leagues made not only with Kings and Emperors but with the Dukes of  Venice  and  Genoa  the Avoyer and Senat of a Canton in  Switzerland  and the Burgermaster of an Imperial Town in  Germany  and the States General of the United Provinces But no man thinking I presume these Leagues would be of any value if they could only oblige the Persons whose names are us'd 'tis plain that they do not stipulate only for themselves and that their stipulations would be of no value if they were merely personal And nothing can more certainly prove they are not so than that we certainly know those Dukes Avoyers and Burgermasters can do nothing of themselves The power of the StatesGeneral of the United Provinces is limited to the points mention'd in the Act of Union made at  Ʋtrecht  The Empire is not oblig'd by any stipulation made by the Emperor without their consent Nothing is more common than for one King making a League with another to exact a confirmation of their Agreement by the Parliaments Diets or General  De Jur Bel l  Estates because says  Grotius  a  Prince dos not stipulate for himself but for the People under his Government  and  a King depriv'd of his Kingdom loses the right of sending an Embassador  The Powers of  Europe  shew'd themselves to be of this opinion in the case of  Portugal  When  Philip  the second had gain'd the possession they treated with him concerning the affairs relating to that Kingdom Few regarded  Don Antonio  and no man consider'd the Dukes of  Savoy Parma  or  Braganza  who perhaps had the most plausible Titles But when his Grandson  Philip  the fourth had lost that Kingdom and the People had set up the Duke of  Braganza  they all treated with him as King And the English Court tho then in amity with  Spain  and not a little influenc'd by a Spanish faction gave example to others by treating with him and not with  Spain  touching matters relating to that State Nay I have bin inform'd by those who well understood the Affairs of that time that the Lord  Cottington  advising the late King not to receive any persons sent from the Duke of  Braganza  Rebel to his Ally the King of  Spain  in the quality of Embassadors the King answer'd that he must look upon that person to be King of  Portugal  who was acknowledg'd by the Nation And I am mistaken if his Majesty now reigning did not find all the Princes and States of the world to be of the same mind when he was out of his Kingdom and could oblige no man but himself and a few followers by any Treaty he could make  For the same reason the names of Kings are us'd in Treatys when they are either Children or otherwise uncapable of knowing what Alliances are fit to be made or rejected and yet such Treatys do equally oblige them their Successors and People as if they were of mature age and fit for government No man therefore ought to think it strange if the King's name be us'd in domestick affairs of which he neither  ought nor can take any cognizance In these cases he is perpetually a Minor he must suffer the Law to take its due course and the Judges thonominated by him are oblig'd by Oath not to have any regard to his Letters or personal Commands If a Man be su'd he must appear and a Delinquent is to be try'd  coram rege  but no otherwise than  secundum legem terrae according to the Law of the Land  not the King's personal will or opinion And the judgments given must be executed whether they please him or not it being always understood that he can speak no otherwise than the Law speaks and is always present as far as the Law requires For this reason a noble Lord who was irregularly detain'd in prison in being by  Habeas Corpus  brought to the Bar of the King's Bench where he su'd to be releas'd upon bail and an ignorant Judg telling him he must apply himself to the King he reply'd that he came thither for that end that the King might eat drink or sleep where he pleas'd but when he render'd Justice he was always in that place The King that renders Justice is indeed always there he never sleeps he is subject to no infirmity he never dies unless the Nation be extinguish'd or so dissipated as to have no Government No Nation that has a sovereign Power within it self dos ever want this King He was in  Athens  and  Rome  as well as at  Babylon  and  Susa  and is as properly said to be now in  Venice Switzerland  or  Holland  as in  France Morocco  or  Turky  This is he to whom we all owe a simple and unconditional obedience This is he  who never dos any wrong  'Tis before him we appear when we demand Juice or render an account of our actions All Jurys give their verdict in his sight They are his Commands that the Judges are bound and sworn to obey when they are not at all to consider such as they receive from the person that wears the Crown 'Twas for Treason against him that  Tresilian  and others like to him in several ages were hang'd They gratify'd the lusts of the visible Powers but the invisible King would not be mock'd He caus'd Justice to be executed upon  Empson  and  Dudley  He was injur'd when the perjur'd wretches who gave that accurs'd Judgment in the case of Shipmony were suffer'd to escape the like punishment by means of the ensuing troubles which they had chiefly rais'd And I leave it to those who are concern'd to consider how many in our days may expect vengeance for the like crimes  I should here conclude this point if the power of granting a  Noli proseq Cesset Processus  and Pardons which are said to be annex'd to the person of the King were not taken for a proof that all proceedings at Law depend upon his will But whoever would from hence draw a general conclusion must first prove his proposition to be universally true If it be wholly false no true deduction can be made and if it be true only in some cases 'tis absurd to draw from thence a general conclusion and to erect a vast fabrick upon a narrow foundation is impossible As to the general proposition I utterly deny it The King cannot stop any Suit that I begin in my own name or invalidate any Judgment I obtain upon it He cannot release a Debt of ten shillings due to me nor a Sentence for the like sum given upon an action of Battery Assault Trespass publick Nuisance or the like He cannot pardon a man condemn'd upon an Appeal nor hinder the person injur'd from appealing His power therefore is not universal if it be not universal it cannot be inherent but confer'd upon him or entrusted by a superior Power that limits it  These limits are fix'd by the Law the Law therefore is above him His proceedings must be regulated by the Law and not the Law by his will Besides the extent of those limits can only be known by the intention of the Law that sets them and are so visible that none but such as are wilfully blind can mistake It cannot be imagin'd that the Law which dos not give a power to the King of pardoning a man that breaks my hedg can intend he should have power to pardon one who kills my father breaks my house robs me of my goods abuses my children and servants wounds me and brings me in danger of my life Whatever power he has in such cases is founded upon a presumption that he who has sworn not to deny or delay justice to any man will not break his Oath to interrupt it And farther as he dos nothing but what he may rightly do  cum magnatum sapientum consilio  and that 'tis suppos'd they will never advise him to do any thing but what ought to be done in order to attain the great ends of the Law Justice and the publick safety nevertheless lest this should not be sufficient to keep things in their due order or that the King should forget his Oath not to delay or deny justice to any man his Counsellors are expos'd to the severest punishments if they advise him to do any thing contrary to it and the Law upon which it is grounded So that the utmost advantage the King can pretend to in this case is no more than that of the  Norman  who said he had gain'd his cause because it depended upon a point that was to be decided by his Oath that is to say if he will betray the trust repos'd in him and perjure himself he may sometimes exempt a Villain from the punishment he deserves and take the guilt upon himself I say sometimes for Appeals may be brought in some cases and the Waterman who had bin pardon'd by his Majesty in the year for a murder he had committed was condemn'd and hang'd at the Assizes upon an Appeal Nay in cases of Treason which some men think relate most particularly to the person of the King he cannot always do it  Gaveston  the two  Spencers Tresilian Empson Dudley  and others have bin executed as Traitors for things done by the King's command and 'tis not doubted they would have bin sav'd if the King's power had extended so far I might add the cases of the Earls of  Strafford  and  Danby  for tho the King sign d a Warrant for the execution of the first no man doubts he would have sav'd him if it had bin in his power The other continues in prison notwithstanding his pardon and for any thing I know he may continue where he is or come out in a way that will not be to his satisfaction unless he be found innocent or something fall out more to his advantage than his Majesty's approbation of what he has done If therefore the King cannot interpose his authority to hinder the course of the Law in contests between private men nor remit the debts adjudg'd to be due or the damages given to the persons agriev'd he can in his own person have no other power in things of this nature than in some degree to mitigate the vindictive power of the Law and this also is to be exercis'd no other way than as he is entrusted But if he acts even in this capacity by a delegated power and in few cases he must act according to the ends for which he is so entrusted as the same Law says  Cum magnatum sapientum consilio  and is not therein to pursue his own will and interests If his Oath farther oblige him not to do it and his Ministers are liable to punishment if they advise him otherwise If in matters of Appeal he has no Power and if his pardons have bin of no value when contrary to his Oath he has abus'd that with which he  is entrusted to the patronizing of crimes and exempting such delinquents from punishment as could not be pardon'd without prejudice to the Publick I may justly conclude that the King before whom every man is bound to appear who dos perpetually and impartially distribute Justice to the Nation is not the Man or Woman that wears the Crown and that He or She cannot determin those matters which by the Law are refer'd to the King Whether therefore such matters are ordinary or extraordinary the decision is and ought to be plac'd where there is most wisdom and stability and where passion and private interest dos least prevail to the obstruction of Justice This is the only way to obviate that confusion and mischief which our Author thinks it would introduce In cases of the first sort this is done in  England  by Judges and Jurys In the other by the Parliament which being the Representative Body of the People and the collected Wisdom of the Nation is least subject to error most exempted from passion and most free from corruption their own good both publick and private depending upon the rectitude of their Sanctions They cannot do any thing that is ill without damage to themselves and their posterity which being all that can be done by human understanding our Lives Libertys and Propertys are by our Laws directed to depend upon them  SECT XLIII Proclamations are not Laws  OUR Author according to his usual method and integrity lays great weight upon Proclamations as the significations of the King's pleasure which in his opinion is our only Law But neither Law nor Reason openly directing nor by consequences insinuating that such a Power should be put into an uncertain or suspected hand we may safely deny them to be Laws or in any sense to have the effect of Laws Nay they cannot be so much as Significations of his Will for as he is King he can have no Will but as the Law directs If he depart from the Law he is no longer King and his Will is nothing to us Proclamations at most are but temporary by the advice of Council in pursuance of the Law If they be not so the Subject is no way oblig'd to obey them and the Counsellors are to be punish'd for them These Laws are either immemorial Customs or Statutes The first have their beginning and continuance from the universal consent of the Nation The latter receive their Authority and Force of Laws from Parliaments as is frequently exprest in the Preambles These are under God the best defence of our Lives Libertys and Estates they proceed not from the blind corrupt and fluctuating humor of a man but from the mature deliberation of the choicest Persons of the Nation and such  s have the greatest interest in it Our Ancestors have always rely'd upon these Laws and 'tis to be hop'd we shall not be so abandon'd by God so depriv'd of courage and common sense to suffer our selves to be cheated of the Inheritance which they have so frequently so bravely and so constantly defended Tho Experience has too well taught us that Parliaments may have their failings and that the Vices which are industriously spread among them may be too prevalent yet they are the best  helps we have and we may much more reasonably depend upon them than upon those who propagate that corruption among them for which only they can deserve to be suspected We hope they will take care of our concernments since they are as other men so soon as a Session is ended and can do nothing to our prejudice that will not equally affect them and their posterity besides the guilt of betraying their Country which can never be wash'd off If some should prove false to their trust 'tis probable that others would continue in their integrity Or if the base arts which are usually practis'd by those who endeavor to delude corrupt enslave and ruin Nations should happen to prevail upon the youngest and weakest it may be reasonably hop'd that the wisest will see the snares and instruct their Companions to avoid them But if all things were so put into the hands of one man that his Proclamations were to be esteem'd Laws the Nation would be expos'd to ruin as soon as it should chance to fall into an ill hand 'Tis in vain to say we have a good King who will not make an ill use of his Power for even the best are subject to be deceiv'd by Flatterers and Crown'd Heads are almost ever encompast by them The principal Art of a Courtier is to observe his Master's Passions and to attack him on that side where he seems to be most weak It would be a strange thing to find a man impregnable in every part and if he be not 'tis impossible he should resist all the attempts that are made upon him If his Judgment comes to be prepossest he and all that depend on him are lost Contradictions tho never so just are then unsafe and no man will venture upon them but he who dares sacrifice himself for the publick good The nature of man is frail and stands in need of assistance Vertuous actions that are profitable to the Commonwealth ought to be made as far as 'tis possible safe easy and advantageous and 'tis the utmost imprudence to tempt men to be enemys to the Publick by suffering the most pernicious actions to be the means of obtaining Honor and Favor whilst no man can serve his Country but with the ruin of himself and his family  However in this case the Question is not concerning a Person the same Counsels are to be follow'd when  Moses  or  Samuel  is in the Throne as if  Caligula  had invaded it Laws ought to aim at perpetuity but the Vertues of a man dy with him and very often before him Those who have deserv'd the highest praises for wisdom and integrity have frequently left the honors they enjoy'd to foolish and vicious Children If Vertue may in any respect be said to outlive the Person it can only be when good men frame such Laws and Constitutions as by favoring it preserve themselves This has never bin done otherwise than by balancing the Powers in such a manner that the corruption which one or a few men might fall into should not be suffer'd to spread the contagion to the ruin of the whole The long continuance of  Lycurgus  his Laws is to be attributed to this They restrain'd the lusts of Kings and reduc'd those to order who adventur'd to transgress them Whereas the whole fabrick must have fallen to the ground in a short time if the first that had a fancy to be absolute had bin able to effect his design This has bin the fate of all Governments that were made to depend upon the vertue of a man which never continues long in any family and when that fails all is lost The Nations therefore that are so happy to have good Kings ought to make a right use of them by establishing the good that may outlast their Lives Those of them that are good will readily join in this work and take care that their Successors may be oblig'd in doing the like to be equally beneficial  to their own Familys and the People they govern If the Rulers of Nations be restrain'd not only the People are by that means secur'd from the mischiefs of their vices and follys but they themselves are preserv'd from the greatest temptations to ill and the terrible effects of the vengeance that frequently ensues upon it An unlimited Prince might be justly compar'd to a weak ship expos'd to a violent storm with a vast Sail and no Rudder We have an eminent example of this in the Book of  Esther  Chap  A wicked Villain having fill'd the ears of a foolish King with false storys of the  Jews  he issues out a Proclamation for their utter extirpation and not long after being inform'd of the truth he gave them leave by another Proclamation to kill whom they pleas'd which they executed upon seventy thousand men The Books of  Ezra Nehemiah  and  Daniel  manifestly discover the like fluctuation in all the Counsels of  Nabuchodonosor Cyrus Darius  and  Artaxerxes  When good men had credit with them they favor'd the  Israelites  sent them back to their own Country restor'd the sacred Vessels that had bin taken away gave them all things necessary for the rebuilding of the City and advanc'd the chief of them to the highest employments But if they fell into ill hands three just men must be thrown into the burning Furnace for refusing to worship an Idol  Daniel  must be cast to the Lions the holy City esteem'd rebellious and those who endeavor'd to rebuild it enemys to Kings Such was the state of things when their Proclamations pass'd for Laws and numbers of flattering Slaves were ready to execute their Commands without examining whether they were just or unjust good or bad The life and death of the best men together with the very being of Nations was expos'd to chance and they were either preserv'd or destroy'd according to the humor of that man who spoke last to the King or happen'd to have credit with him If a frantick fancy come into the head of a drunken whore  Persepolis  must be burnt and the hand of  Alexander  is ready to execute her will If a dancing wench please  Herod  the most venerable of all human Heads must be offer'd in a dish for a sacrifice to the rage of her impure mother The nature of man is so frail that wheresoever the word of a single Person has had the force of a Law the innumerable extravagances and mischiefs it has produc'd have bin so notorious that all Nations who are not stupid slavish and brutish have always abominated it and made it their principal care to find out remedys against it by so dividing and balancing the Powers of their Government that one or a few men might not be able to oppress and destroy those they ought to preserve and protect This has always bin as grateful to the best and wisest Princes as necessary to the weakest and worst as I have prov'd already by the examples of  Theopompus Moses  and others These considerations have given beginning growth and continuance to all the mix'd Governments that have bin in the World and I may justly say there never was a good one that was not mix'd If other proofs of their rectitude were wanting our Author's hatred would be enough to justify them He is so bitter an enemy to Mankind as to be displeas'd with nothing but that which tends to their good and so perverse in his judgment that we have reason to believe that to be good which he most abhors One would think he had taken the model of the Government he proposes from the monstrous Tyranny of  Ceylon  an Island in the  EastIndys  where the King knows no other Law than his own will He kills tears in pieces empales or throws to his Elephants whomsoever he pleases No man has any thing that he can call his own He seldom fails to destroy those who have  bin employ'd in his domestick Service or publick Offices and few obtain the favor of being put to death and thrown to the Dogs without torments His Subjects approach him no otherwise than on their knees licking the dust and dare assume to themselves no other name than that of Dogs or limbs of Dogs This is a true pattern of  Filmer  's  Patriarchical Monarch  His Majesty I suppose is sufficiently exalted for he dos whatever he pleases The exercise of his power is as gentle as can reasonably be expected from one who has all by the unquestionable right of usurpation and knows the People will no longer suffer him and the Villains he hires to be the instruments of his Cruelty than they can be kept in such ignorance weakness and baseness as neither to know how to provide for themselves or dare to resist him We ought to esteem our selves happy if the like could be establish'd among us and are much oblig'd to our Author for so kindly proposing an expedient that might terminate all our disputes Let Proclamations obtain the power of Laws and the business is done They may be so ingeniously contriev'd that the antient Laws which we and our Fathers have highly valu'd shall be abolish'd or made a snare to all those that dare remember they are  Englishmen  and are guilty of the unpardonable crime of loving their Country or have the courage conduct and reputation requir'd to defend it This is the sum of  Filmer  's Philosophy and this is the Legacy he has left to testify his affection to the Nation which having for a long time lain unregarded has bin lately brought into the light again as an introduction of a Popish Successor who is to be establish'd as we ought to believe for the security of the Protestant Religion and our  English  Libertys Both will undoubtedly flourish under a Prince who is made to believe the Kingdom is his Patrimony that his Will is a Law and that he has a Power which none may resist If any man doubt whether he will make a good use of it he may only examin the Historys of what others in the same circumstances have done in all places where they have had power The principles of that Religion are fo full of meekness and charity the Popes have always shew'd themselves so gentle towards those who would not submit to their Authority the Jesuits who may be accounted the Soul that give Life to the whole Body of that Faction are so well natur'd faithful and exact in their Morals so full of innocence justice and truth that no violence is to be fear'd from such as are govern'd by them The fatherly care shew'd to the Protestants of  France  by the five last Kings of the House of  Valois  the mercy of  Philip  the Second of  Spain  to his Pagan Subjects in the  WestIndys  and the more hated Protestants in the  Netherlands  the moderation of the Dukes of  Savoy  towards the  Vaudois  in the Marquisat of  Saluzzo  and the Vallys of  Piedmont  the gentleness and faith of the two  Marys  Queens of  England  and  Scotland  the kindness of the Papists to the Protestants of  Ireland  in with what we have reason to believe they did and do still intend if they can accomplish the ends o  their Conspiracy In a word the sweetness and Apostolical meekness of the Inquisition may sufficiently convince us that nothing is to be sear'd where that Principle reigns We may suffer the word of such a Prince to be a Law and the People to be made to believe it ought to be so▪ when he is expected Tho we should wave the Bill of Exclusion and not only admit him to reign as other Kings have done but resign the whole Power into his hands it would neither bring inconvenience or danger on the present King He can with patience expect that nature should take her course and would neither anticipate nor secure his  entrance into the possession of the Power by taking one day from the Life of his Brother Tho the Papists know that like a true Son of their Church he would prefer the advancement of their Religion before all other considerations and that one stab with a Dagger or a dose of Poison would put all under his feet not one man would be found among them to give it The Assassins were Mahometans not Pupils of the honest Jesuits nor ever employ'd by them These things being certain all our concernments would be secure if instead of the foolish Statutes and antiquated Customs on which our Ancestors and we have hitherto doted we may be troubled with no Law but the King's will and a Proclamation may be taken for a sufficient declaretion of it We shall by this means be deliver'd from that  Liberty with a mischief  in which our mistaken Nation seems so much to delight This phrase is so new and so peculiar to our Autor that it deserves to be written upon his Tomb We have heard of  Tyranny with a mischief Slavery and Bondage with a mischief  and they have bin denounc'd by God against wicked and perverse Nations as mischiefs comprehending all that is most to be abhor'd and dreaded in the world But  Filmer  informs us that Liberty which all wise and good men have in all Ages esteem'd to be the most valuable and glorious privilege of Mankind is  a mischief  If he deserves credit  Moses Joshua Gideon Sampson  and  Samuel  with others like them were enemys to their Country in depriving the People of the advantages they enjoy'd under the paternal care of  Pharaoh Adonibezek Eglon Jabin  and other Kings of the neighboring Nations and restoring them to that  Liberty with a mischief  which he had promis'd to them The  Israelites  were happy under the power of Tyrants whose Proclamations were Laws and they ought to have bin thankful to God for that condition and not for the deliverances he wrought by the hands of his Servants Subjection to the will of a man is happiness Liberty is a  mischief  But this is so abominably wicked and detestable that it can deserve no answer  SECT XLIV A People that is not free cannot substitute Delegats  HOW full soever the Power of any Person or People may be he or they are oblig'd to give only so much to their Delegats as seems convenient to themselves or conducing to the ends they desire to attain but the Delegate can have none except what is confer'd upon him by his Principal If therefore the Knights Citizens and Burgesses sent by the People of  England  to serve in Parliament have a Power it must be more perfectly and fully in those that send them But as was prov'd in the last Section Proclamations and other significations of the King's pleasure are not Laws to us They are to be regulated by the Law not the Law by them They are to be consider'd only so far as they are conformable to the Law from which they receive all the strength that is in them and can confer none upon it We know no Laws but our own Statutes and those immemorial Customs establish'd by the consent of the Nation which may be and often are chang'd by us The Legislative Power therefore that is exercis'd by the Parliament cannot be confer'd by the Writ of Summons but must be essentially and radically in the  People from whom their Delegates and Representatives have all that they have But says our Author  They must only chuse and trust those whom they chuse to do what they list and that is as much Liberty as many of us deserve for our irregular Elections of Burgesses  This is ingeniously concluded I take what Servant I please and when I have taken him I must suffer him to do what he pleases But from whence should this necessity arise Why may not I take one to be my Groom another to be my Cook and keep them both to the Offices for which I took them What Law dos herein restrain my Right And if I am free in my private capacity to regulate my particular affairs according to my own discretion and to allot to each Servant his proper work why have not I with my Associates the Freemen of  England  the like liberty of directing and limiting the Powers of the Servants we employ in our publick Affairs Our Author gives us reasons proportionable to his judgment  This were liberty with a mischief and that of chusing only is as much as many of us deserve  I have already prov'd that as far as our Historys reach we have had no Princes or Magistrats but such as we have made and they have had no other Power than what we have confer'd upon them They cannot be the judges of our Merit who have no Power but what we gave them thro an opinion they did or might deserve it They may distribute in parcels to particulars that with which they are entrusted in the gross But 'tis impossible the Publick should depend absolutely upon those who are nothing above other men except what they are made to be for and by the Publick The restrictions therefore of the Peoples Liberty must be from themselves or there can be none  Nevertheless I believe that the Powers of every County City and Borough of  England  are regulated by the general Law to which they have all consented and by which they are all made Members of one Political Body This obliges them to proceed with their Delegats in a manner different from that which is us'd in the United Netherlands or in  Switzerland  Amongst these every Province City or Canton making a distinct Body independent from any other and exercising the Sovereign Power within it self looks upon the rest only as Allies to whom they are bound only by such Acts as they themselves have made and when any new thing not comprehended in them happens to arise they oblige their Delegats to give them an account of it and retain the power of determining those matters in themselves 'Tis not so amongst us Every County dos not make a distinct Body having in it self a Sovereign Power but is a Member of that Great Body which comprehends the whole Nation 'Tis not therefore for  Kent  or  Sussex Lewis  or  Mai  stone  but for the whole Nation that the Members chosen in those places are sent to serve in Parliament and tho it be fit for them as Friends and Neighbors so far as may be to hearken to the Opinions of the Electors for the Information of their Judgments and to the end that what they shall say may be of more weight when every one is known not to speak his own thoughts only but those of a great number of men yet they are not strictly and properly oblig'd to give account of their Actions to any unless the whole Body of the Nation for which they serve and who are equally concern'd in their Resolutions could be assembled This being impracticable the only punishment to which they are subject if they betray their Trust is scorn infamy hatred and an assurance of being rejected when they shall again seek the same Honor And tho this may seem a small matter to those who fear to do ill  only from a sense of the pains inflicted yet it is very terrible to men of ingenuous spirits as they are suppos'd to be who are accounted fit to be entrusted with so great Powers But why it should be call'd  Liberty with a mischief  if it were otherwise or how the liberty of particular Societys would be greater if they might do what they pleas'd than whilst they send others to act for them such wise men only as  Filmer  can tell us For as no man or number of men can give a Power which he or they have not the  Achaians Etolians Latins Samnites  and  Tuscans  who transacted all things relating to their Associations by Delegates and the  Athenians Carthaginians  and  Romans  who kept the power of the State in themselves were all equally free And in our days the United Provinces of the  Netherlands  the  Switzers  and  Grisons  who are of the first sort and the  Venetians Genoeses  and  Luccheses  who are of the other are so also All men that have any degree of common sense plainly see that the Liberty of those who act in their own persons and of those who send Delegates is perfectly the same and the exercise is and can only be chang'd by their consent  But whatever the Law or Custom of  England  be in this point it cannot concern our question The general proposition concerning a Patriarchical Power cannot be prov'd by a single example If there be a general Power every where forbidding Nations to give instructions to their Delegates they can do it no where If there be no such thing every People may do it unless they have depriv'd themselves of their right all being born under the same condition 'Tis to no purpose to say that the Nations before mention'd had not Kings and therefore might act as they did For if the general Thesis be true they must have Kings and if it be not none are oblig'd to have them unless they think fit and the Kings they make are their Creatures But many of these Nations had either Kings or other Magistrats in power like to them The Provinces of the  Netherlands  had Dukes Earls or Marquesses  Genoa  and  Venice  have Dukes If any on account of the narrowness of their Territorys have abstain'd from the Name it dos not alter the case for our dispute is not concerning the Name but the Right If that one Man who is in the principal Magistracy of every Nation must be reputed the Father of that People and has a Power which may not be limited by any Law it imports not what he is call'd But if in small Territorys he may be limited by Laws he may be so also in the greatest The least of men is a man as well as a Giant And those in the  WestIndys  who have not above twenty or thirty Subjects able to bear Arms are Kings as well as  Xerxes  Every Nation may divide it self into small parcels as some have done by the same Law they have restrain'd or abolish'd their Kings join'd to one another or taken their hazard of subsisting by themselves acted by delegation or retaining the Power in their own persons given finite or indefinite Powers reserv'd to themselves a power of punishing those who should depart from their duty or refer'd it to their General Assemblys And that Liberty for which we contend as the Gift of God and Nature remains equally to all  If men who delight in cavilling should say that great Kingdoms are not to be regulated by the Examples of small States I desire to know when it was that God ordain'd great Nations should be Slaves and depriv'd of all right to dispose matters relating to their Government whilst he left to such as had or should divide themselves into small parcels a right of making such Constitutions as were most convenient for them  When this is resolv'd we ought to be inform'd what extent of Territory is requir'd to deserve the name of a great Kingdom  Spain  and  France  are esteem'd great and yet the Deputys or  Procuradores  of the  Vida de Carlos    de Sandoval  several parts of  Castille  did in the  Cortez  held at  Madrid  in the beginning of  Charles  the fifth's reign excuse themselves from giving the supplys he desir'd because they had receiv'd no orders in that particular from the Towns that sent them and afterwards receiving express orders not to do it they gave his Majesty a flat denial The like was frequently done during the reigns of that great Prince and of his Son  Philip  the second And generally those  Procuradores  never granted any thing of importance to either of them without particular Orders from their Principals The same way was taken in  France  as long as there were any General Assemblys of Estates and if it dos not still continue 'tis because there are none For no man who understood the Affairs of that Kingdom did ever deny that the Deputys were oblig'd to follow the Orders of those who sent them And perhaps if men would examin by what means they came to be abolish'd they might find that the Cardinals  de Richelieu  and  Mazarin  with other Ministers who have accomplish'd that work were acted by some other principle than that of Justice or the establishment of the Laws of God and Nature In the General Assembly of Estates held at  Blois  in the time of  Henry  the third  Bodin  then  Hist Thuan  Deputy for the third Estate of  Vermandois  by their particular Order propos'd so many things as took up a great part of their time Other Deputys alledg'd no other reason for many things said and done by them highly contrary to the King's will than that they were commanded so to do by their Superiors These General Assemblys being laid aside the same custom is still us'd in the lesser Assemblys of Estates in  Languedoc  and  Britany  The Deputys cannot without the infamy of betraying their Trust and fear of punishment recede from the Orders given by their Principals and yet we do not find that  Liberty with a mischief  is much more predominant in  France  than amongst us The same method is every day practis'd in the Diets of  Germany  The Princes and great Lords who have their places in their own right may do what they please but the Deputys of the Citys must follow such Orders as they receive The Historys of  Denmark Sweden Poland  and  Bohemia  testify the same thing and if this  Liberty with a mischief  dos not still continue intire in all those places it has bin diminish'd by such means as sute better with the manners of Pirats than the Laws of God and Nature If  England  therefore dos not still enjoy the same we must have bin depriv'd of it either by such unjustifiable means or by our own consent But thanks be to God we know no People who have a better right to Liberty or have better defended it than our own Nation And if we do not degenerate from the Vertue of our Ancestors we may hope to transmit it intire to our Posterity We always may and often do give Instructions to our Delegates but the less we fetter them the more we manifest our own Rights for those who have only a limited Power must limit that which they give but they that can give an unlimited Power must necessarily have it in themselves The great Treasurer  Burleigh  said the Parliament could do any thing but turn a Man into a Woman Sir  Thomas Moor  when  Rich  Solicitor to K  Henry  the  th  ask'd him if the Parliament might not make  R Rich  King said that was  casus levis  taking it for granted that they might make or unmake whom they pleas'd The first part of this which includes the other is asserted by the Statute of the    th  of Q  Elizabeth  denouncing the most grievous punishments against all such as should dare to contradict it But if it be in the Parliament it must be in those who give to Parliamentmen the powers by which they act for before they are chosen they have none and can never have any if those that send them had it not in themselves They cannot receive it from the Magistrate for that power which he has is deriv'd from the same spring The power of making and unmaking him cannot be from himself for he that is not can do nothing and when he is made can have no other power than is confer'd upon him by those that make him Besides he who departs from his duty desires to avoid the punishment the power therefore of punishing him is not from himself It cannot be from the House of Peers as it is constituted for they act for themselves and are chosen by Kings and 'tis absurd to think that Kings who generally abhor all restriction of their Power should give that to others by which they might be unmade If one or more Princes relying upon their own Vertue and Resolutions to do good had given such a power against themselves as  Trajan  did when he commanded the Prefect to use the Sword for him if he govern'd well and against him if he govern'd ill it would soon have bin rescinded by their Successors If our  Edward  the first had made such a Law his leud Son would have abolish'd it before he would have suffer'd himself to be imprison'd and depos'd by it He would never have acknowledg'd his unworthiness to reign if he had bin ty'd to no other Law than his own will for he could not transgress that nor have own'd the mercy of the Parliament in sparing his Life if they had acted only by a power which he had confer'd upon them This Power must therefore be in those who act by a delegated Power and none can give it to their Delegates but they who have it in themselves The most certain testimony that can be given of their unlimited Power is that they rely upon the Wisdom and Fidelity of their Deputys so as to lay no restrictions upon them they may do what they please if they take care  ne quid detrimenti Respublica accipiat that the Commonwealth receives no detriment  This is a Commission fit to be granted by wise and good men to those they chuse thro an opinion that they are so also and that they cannot bring any prejudice upon the Nation that will not fall upon themselves and their posterity This is also fit to be receiv'd by those who seeking nothing but that which is just in it self and profitable to their Country cannot foresee what will be propos'd when they are all met together much less resolve how to vote till they hear the reasons on both sides The Electors must necessarily be in the same ignorance and that Law which should oblige them to give particular Orders to their Knights and Burgesses in relation to every Vote would make the decision of the most important Affairs to depend upon the judgment of those who know nothing of the matters in question and by that means cast the Nation into the utmost danger of the most inextricable confusion This can never be the intention of that Law which is  Sanctio recta  and seeks only the good of those that live under it The foresight therefore of such a mischief can never impair the Libertys of the Nation but establish them  SECT XLV The Legislative Power is always Arbitrary and not to be trusted in the hands of any who are not bound to obey the Laws they make  IF it be objected that I am a defender of Arbitrary Powers I confess I cannot comprehend how any Society can be establish'd or subsist without them for the establishment of Government is an arbitrary Act wholly depending upon the will of man The particular Forms and Constitutions the whole Series of the Magistracy together with the measure of Power given to every one and the Rules by which they are to exercise their Charge are so also  Magna Charta  which comprehends our antient Laws and all the subsequent Statutes were not sent from Heaven but made according to the will of men If no men could have a Power of making Laws none could ever have bin made for all that are or have bin in the World except those given by God to the  Israelites  were made by them that is they have exercis'd an Arbitrary Power in making that to be Law which was not or annulling that which was The various Laws and Governments that are or have bin in several Ages and Places are the product of various opinions in those who had the power of making them This must necessarily be unless a general Rule be set to all for the Judgments of men will vary if they are left to their liberty and the variety that is found among them shews they are subject to no Rule but that of their own Reason by which they see what is fit to be embrac'd or avoided according to the several circumstances under which they live The Authority that judges of these circumstances is arbitrary and the Legislators shew themselves to be more or less wise and good as they do rightly or not rightly exercise this Power The difference therefore between good and ill Governments is not that those of one sort have an Arbitrary Power which the others have not for they all have it but that those which are well constituted place this Power so as it may be beneficial to the People and set such Rules as are hardly to be transgrest whilst those of the other sort fail in one or both these points Some also thro want of courage fortune or strength may have bin opprest by the violence of Strangers or suffer'd a corrupt Party to rise up within themselves and by force or fraud to usurp a Power of imposing what they pleas'd Others being sottish cowardly and base have so far err'd in the Foundations as to give up themselves to the will of one or few men who turning all to their own profit or pleasure have bin just in nothing but in using such a People like beasts Some have plac'd weak defences against the lusts of those they have advanc'd to the highest places and given them opportunitys of arrogating more power to themselves than the Law allows Where any of these errors are committed the Government may be easy for a while or at least tolerable whilst it continues uncorrupted but it cannot be lasting When the Law may be easily or safely overthrown it will be attempted Whatever vertue may be in the first Magistrats many years will not pass before they come to be corrupted and their Successors deflecting from their integrity will seize upon the illguarded prey They will then not only govern by will but by that irregular will which turns the Law that was made for the publick  good to the private advantage of one or few men 'Tis not my intention to enumerate the several ways that have bin taken to effect this or to shew what Governments have deflected from the right and how far But I think I may justly say that an Arbitrary Power was never well plac'd in any men and their Successors who were not oblig'd to obey the Laws they should make This was well understood by our  Saxon  Ancestors They made Laws in their Assemblys and Councils of the Nation but all those who propos'd or assented to those Laws as soon as the Assembly was dissolv'd were comprehended under the power of them as well as other men They could do nothing to the prejudice of the Nation that would not be as hurtful to those who were present and their posterity as to those who by many accidents might be absent The  Normans  enter'd into and continu'd in the same path Our Parliaments at this day are in the same condition They may make prejudicial Wars ignominious Treatys and unjust Laws yet when the Session is ended they must bear the burden as much as others and when they dy  the teeth of their Children will be set an edg with the sour Grapes they have eaten  But 'tis hard to delude or corrupt so many Men do not in matters of the highest importance yield to slight temptations No man serves the Devil for nothing Small wages will not content those who expose themselves to perpetual infamy and the hatred of a Nation for betraying their Country Our Kings had not wherewithal to corrupt many till these last twenty years and the treachery of a few was not enough to pass a Law The union of many was not easily wrought and there was nothing to tempt them to endeavour it for they could make little advantage during the Session and were to be lost in the mass of the People and prejudic'd by their own Laws as soon as it was ended They could not in a short time reconcile their various interests or passions so as to combine together against the Publick and the former Kings never went about it We are beholden to  Hde Clffrd  and  Dnby  for all that has bin done of that kind They found a Parliament full of leud young men chosen by a furious People in spite to the Puritans whose severity had distasted them The weakest of all Ministers had wit enough to understand that such as these might be easily deluded corrupted or brib'd Some were fond of their Seats in Parliament and delighted to domineer over their Neighbors by continuing in them Others prefer'd the cajolerys of the Court before the honor of performing their duty to the Country that employ'd them Some sought to relieve their ruin'd Fortunes and were most forward to give the King a vast Revenue that from thence they might receive Pensions others were glad of a temporary Protection against their Creditors Many knew not what they did when they annul'd the Triennial Act voted the Militia to be in the King gave him the Excise Customs and Chimnymony made the Act for Corporations by which the greatest part of the Nation was brought under the power of the worst men in it drunk or sober pass'd the Fivemile Act and that for Uniformity in the Church This embolden'd the Court to think of making Parliaments to be the instruments of our Slavery which had in all Ages past bin the firmest pillars of our Liberty There might have bin perhaps a possibility of preventing this pernicious mischief in the Constitution of our Government But our brave Antestors could never think their Posterity would degenerate into such baseness to sell themselves and their Country yet how great soever the danger may be 'tis less than to put all into the hands of  one Man and his Ministers the hazard of being ruin'd by those who must perish with us is not so much to be fear'd as by one who may enrich and strengthen himself by our destruction 'Tis better to depend upon those who are under a possibility of being again corrupted than upon one who applys himself to corrupt them because he cannot otherwise accomplish his designs It were to be wish'd that our security were more certain but this being under God the best Anchor we have it deserves to be preserv'd with all care till one of a more unquestionable strength be fram'd by the consent of the Nation  SECT XLVI The coercive power of the Law proceeds from the Authority of Parliament  HAVING prov'd that Proclamations are not Laws and that the Legislative Power which is arbitrary is trusted only in the hands of those who are bound to obey the Laws that are made 'tis not hard to discover what it is that gives the power of Law to the Sanctions under which we live Our Author tells us That  all Statutes or Laws are made properly by the King alone at the Rogation of the People as his Majesty King  James  of happy Memory affirms in his true Law of Free Monarchy and as  Hooker  teaches us That Laws do not take their constraining power from the quality of such as devise them but from the power that gives them the strength of Law  But if the Rogation of the People be necessary that cannot be a Law which proceeds not from their Rogation the power therefore is not alone in the King for a most important part is confest to be in the People And as none could be in them if our Author's Proposition or the Principles upon which it is grounded were true the acknowledgment of such a part to be in the People shews them to be false For if the King had all in himself none could participate with him if any do participate he has not all and 'tis from that Law by which they do participate that we are to know what part is left to him The preambles of most Acts of Parliament manifest this by the words  Be it enacted by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in Parliament assembled and by Authority of the same  But  King  James says  Filmer in his Law of Free Monarchy affirms the contrary  and it may be so yet that is nothing to us No man doubts that he desir'd it might be so in  England  but it dos not from thence appear that it is so The Law of a Free Monarchy is nothing to us for that Monarchy is not free which is regulated by a Law not to be broken without the guilt of Perjury as he himself  Speech in StarChamber    confest in relation to ours As to the words cited from  Hooker  I can find no hurt in them To draw up the form of a good Law is a matter of invention and jugdment but it receives the force of a Law from the Power that enacts it We have no other reason for the payment of Excise or Customs than that the Parliament has granted those Revenues to the King to defray the publick Charges Whatever therefore King  James  was pleas'd to say in his Books or in those written for him we do not so much as know that the killing of a King is Treason or to be punish'd with death otherwise than as it is enacted by Parliament and it was not always so for in the time  of  Leg Aethe  stani fol    Ethelstan  the Estimates of Lives were agreed in Parliament and that of a King valu'd at thirty thousand  Thrymsae  And if that Law had not bin alter'd by the Parliament it must have bin in force at this day It had bin in vain for a King to say he would have it otherwise for he is not created to make Laws but to govern according to such as are made and sworn to assent to  Quas vulgus elegerit  such as shall be propos'd  He who thinks the Crown not worth accepting on these conditions may refuse it The words  Le Roy le veut  are only a pattern of the  French  fashions upon which some Kings have laid gress stress and would no doubt have bin glad to introduce  Car tel est notre plaisir  but that may prove a difficult matter Nay in  France  it self where that Stile and all the ranting expressions that please the vainest of men are in mode no Edict has the power of a Law till it be register'd in Parliament This is not a mere ceremony as some pretend but all that is essential to a Law Nothing has bin more common than for those Parliaments to refuse Edicts sent to them by the King When  John Chastel  had at the instigation of the Jesuits stab'd  Henry  the Fourth in the Mouth and that Order had design'd or executed many other execrable crimes they were banish'd out of the Kingdom by an Arrest of the Parliament of  Paris  Some other Parliaments register'd the same but those of  Tholouse  and  Bordeaux  absolutely refus'd and notwithstanding all the King could do the Jesuits continu'd at  Tournon  and many other places within their Precincts till the Arrest was revok'd These proceedings are so displeasing to the Court that the most violent ways have bin often us'd to abolish them About the year  Seguier  then Chancellor  Mem de L R F  of  France  was sent with a great number of Soldiers to oblige the Parliament of  Paris  to pass some Edicts upon which they had hesitated but he was so far from accomplishing his design that the People rose against him and he thought himself happy that he escap'd with his Life If the Parliaments do not in all parts of the Kingdom continue in the Liberty of approving or rejecting all Edicts the Law is not alter'd but opprest by the violence of the Sword And the Prince of  Condé  who was principally employ'd to do that work may I suppose have had leisure to reflect on those Actions and cannot but find reason to conclude that his excellent valor and conduct was us'd in a most noble Exploit equally beneficial to his Country and himself However those who are skill'd in the Laws of that Nation do still affirm that all publick Acts which are not duly examin'd and register'd are void in themselves and can be of no force longer than the miserable People lies under the violence of Oppression which is all that could reasonably be said if a Pirat had the same power over them But whether the  French  have willingly offer'd their ears to be bor'd or have bin subdu'd by force it concerns us not Our Libertys depend not upon their will vertue or fortune how wretched and shameful soever their Slavery may be the evil is only to themselves We are to consider no human Laws but our own and if we have the spirit of our Ancestors we shall maintain them and dy as free as they left us  Le Roy le veut  tho written in great Letters or pronounc'd in the most tragical manner can signify no more than that the King in performance of his Oath dos assent to such Laws as the Lords and Commons have agreed Without prejudice to themselves and their Libertys a People may suffer the King to advise with his Council upon what they propose  Two eyes see more than one and human judgment is subject to errors Tho the Parliament consists of the most eminent men of the Nation yet when they intend good they may be mistaken They may safely put a check upon themselves that they may farther consider the most important matters and correct the errors that may have bin committed if the King's Council do discover them but he can speak only by the advice of his Council and every man of them is with his head to answer for the advice he gives If the Parliament has not bin satisfy'd with the reasons given against any Law that they offer'd it has frequently pass'd and if they have bin satisfy'd 'twas not the King but they that laid it aside He that is of another opinion may try whether  Le Roy le veut  can give the force of a Law to any thing conceiv'd by the King his Council or any other than the Parliament But if no wise man will affirm that he can do it or deny that by his Oath he is oblig'd to assent to those that come from them he can neither have the Legislative power in himself nor any other part in it than what is formal and necessarily to be perform'd by him as the Law prescribes  I know not what our Author means by saying  Le Roy le veut is the interpretative phrase pronounc'd at the passing of every Act of Parliament  For if there be difficulty in any of them those words do no way remove it But the following part of the paragraph better deserves to be observ'd  It was  says he  the antient custom for a long time until the days of  Henry  the Fifth for the Kings when any Bill was brought to them that had pass'd both Houses to take and pick out what they lik'd not and so much as they chose was enacted as a Law But the custom of the latter Kings has bin so gracious as to allow always of the intire Bill as it pass'd both Houses  He judiciously observes when our Kings began to be gracious and we to be free That King excepting the persecution for Religion in his time which is rather to be imputed to the ignorance of that Age than to any evil in his own nature govern'd well and as all Princes who have bin vertuous and brave have always desir'd to preserve their Subjects Liberty which they knew to be the mother and nurse of their Valor fitting them for great and generous Enterprizes his care was to please them and to raise their Spirits But about the same time those detestable Arts by which the mix'd Monarchys in this part of the world have bin every where terribly shaken and in many places totally overthrown began to be practis'd  Charles  the Seventh of  France  under pretence of carrying on a War against him and his Son took upon him to raise Mony by his own Authority and we know how well that method has bin pursu'd The mischievous sagacity of his Son  Lewis  the  th  which is now call'd  KingCraft  was wholly exerted in the subversion of the Laws of  France  and the Nobility that supported them His Successors except only  Lewis  the  th  follow'd his example and in other Nations  Ferdinand  of  Arragon James  the Third of  Scotland  and  Henry  the Seventh of  England  were thought to imitate him the most Tho we have little reason to commend all the Princes that preceded  Henry  the Fifth yet I am inclin'd to date the general impairing of our Government from the death of that King and his valiant Brothers His weak Son became a prey to a furious  French  Woman who brought the Maxims of her own Country into ours and advano'd the worst of Villains to govern according to them These measures were pursu'd by  Edward  the  th  whose wants contracted by prodigality and debauchery were to be supply'd by fraud and rapine The ambition cruelty and perfidiousness of  Richard  the  d  the covetousness and malicious subtilty of  Henry  the  th  the violent lust rage and pride of  Henry  the  th  and the bigotted fury of Q  Mary  instigated by the craft and malice of  Spain  persuaded me to believe that the  English  Liberty did not receive birth or growth from the favor and goodness of their gracious Princes But it seems all this is mistaken  Henry  the  th  was wise valiant and no way guided by his Wife  Edward  the fourth continent sober and contented with what the Nation gave him  Richard  the third mild gentle and faithful  Henry  the  th  sincere and satisfy'd with his own  Henry  the  th  humble temperate and just and Queen  Mary  a friend to our Country and Religion No less praises sure can be due to those who were so gracious to recede from their own right of picking what they pleas'd out of our Laws and to leave them intirely to us as they pass'd both Houses We are beholden to our Author for the discovery of these mysterys but tho he seems to have taken an Oath like that of the Gypsys when they enter into that vertuous Society never to speak one word of truth he is not so subtle in concealing his Lies All Kings were trusted with the publication of the Laws but all Kings did not falsify them Such as were not wicked and vicious or so weak as to be made subservient to the malice of their Ministers and Flatterers could never be drawn into the guilt of so infamous a cheat directly contrary to the Oath of their Coronation They swear to pass such  Laws  Quas vulgus elegerit  as the People chuse  but if we will believe our Author they might have pick'd out whatever they pleas'd and falsly impos'd upon the Nation as a Law made by the Lords and Commons that which they had model'd according to their own will and made to be different from or contrary to the intention of the Parliament The King's part in this fraud of which he boasts was little more than might have bin done by the Speaker or his Clerks They might have falsify'd an Act as well as the King tho they could not so well preserve themselves from punishment 'Tis no wonder if for a while no stop was put to such an abominable Custom 'Twas hard to think a King would be guilty of a fraud that were infamous in a Slave But that prov'd to be a small security when the worst of Slaves came to govern them Nevertheless 'tis probable they proceeded cautiously the first alterations were perhaps innocent or it may be for the best But when they had once found out the way they stuck at nothing that seem'd for their purpose This was like the plague of Leprosy that could not be cur'd the house infected was to be demolish'd the poisonous plant must be torn up by the root the trust that had bin broken was to be abolish'd they who had perverted or frustrated the Law were no longer to be suffer'd to make the least alteration and that brave Prince readily join'd with his People to extinguish the mischievous abuse that had bin introduc'd by some of his worthless Predecessors The worst and basest of them had continual disputes with their Parliaments and thought that whatever they could detract from the Liberty of the Nation would serve to advance their Prerogative They delighted in frauds and would have no other Ministers but such as would be the instruments of them Since their Word could not be made to pass for a Law they indeavor'd to impose their own or their Servants inventions as Acts of Parliament upon the deluded people and to make the best of them subservient to their corrupt Ends and pernicious Counsels This if it had continu'd might have overthrown all our Rights and depriv'd us of all that men can call good in the world But the Providence of God furnish'd our Ancestors with an  opportunity of providing against so great so universal a mischief They had a wise and valiant Prince who scorn'd to encroach upon the Libertys of his Subjects and abhor'd the detestable Arts by which they had bin impair'd He esteem'd their courage strength and love to be his greatest Advantage Riches and Glory He aim'd at the conquest of  France  which was only to be effected by the bravery of a free and well satisfy'd People Slaves will always be cowards and enemys to their Master By bringing his Subjects into that condition he must infallibly have ruin'd his own designs and made them unfit to fight either for him or themselves He desir'd not only that his People should be free during his time but that his Successors should not be able by oblique and fraudulent ways to enslave them If it be a reproach to us that Women have reign'd over us 'tis much more to the Princes that succeeded our  Henry  that none of them did so much imitate him in his Government as Queen  Elizabeth  She did not go about to mangle Acts of Parliament and to pick out what might serve her turn but frequently pass'd forty of fifty in a Session without reading one of them She knew that she did not reign for her self but for her People that what was good for them was either good for her or that her good ought not to come into competition with that of the whole Nation and that she was by Oath oblig'd to pass such Laws as were presented to her on their behalf This not only shews that there is no such thing as a Legislative Power plac'd in Kings by the Laws of God and Nature but that Nations have it in themselves It was not by Law nor by Right but by Usurpation Fraud and Perjury that some Kings took upon them to pick what they pleas'd out of the publick Acts  Henry  the fifth did not grant us the right of making our own Laws but with his approbation we abolish'd a detestable abuse that might have prov'd fatal to us And if we examin our History we shall find that every good and generous Prince has sought to establish our Libertys as much as the most base and wicked to infringe them *  THE END  The COPY of a PAPER Deliver'd to the SHERIFFS Upon the Scaffold on  Towerhill  On Friday  Decemb  BY Algernon Sidney  Esq  Immediately before his Death Men Brethren and Fathers Friends Countrymen and Strangers  IT May be expected that I should now say some great matters unto you but the Rigor of the Season and the Infirmitys of my Age increas'd by a close Imprisonment of above five Months do not permit me  Moreover we live in an Age that makes Truth pass for Treason I dare not say any thing contrary unto it and the Ears of those that are about me will probably be found too tender to hear it My Trial and Condemnation doth sufficiently evidence this  West Rumsey  and  Keyling  who were brought to prove the Plot said no more of me than that they knew me not and some others equally unknown to me had us'd my Name and that of some others to give a little Reputation to their Designs The Lord  Howard  is too infamous by his Life and the many Perjurys not to be deny'd or rather sworn by himself  to deserve mention and being a single Witness would be of no value tho he had been of unblemish'd Credit or had not seen and confess'd that the Crimes committed by him would be pardon'd only for committing more and even the Pardon promis'd could not be obtain'd till the drudgery of Swearing was over  This being laid aside the whole matter is reduc'd to the Papers said to be found in my Cl  f  t by the King's Officers without any other Proof of their being written by me than what is taken from suppositions upon the similitude of an Hand that is easily counterfeited and which hath been lately declar'd in the Lady  Car  's Case to be no lawful Evidence in Criminal Causes  But if I had been seen to write them the matter would not be much alter'd They plainly appear to relate to a large Treatise written long since in Answer to  Filmer  's Book which by all Intelligent Men is thought to be grounded upon wicked Principles equally pernicious to Magistrates and People  If he might publish to the World his Opinion That all Men are born under a necessity deriv'd from the Laws of God and Nature to submit to an Absolute Kingly Government which could be restrain'd by no Law or Oath and that he that has the Power whether he came to it by Creation Election Inheritance Usurpation or any other way had the Right and none must oppose his Will but the Persons and Estates of his Subjects must be indispensably subject unto it I know not why I might not have publish'd my Opinion to the contrary without the breach of any Law I have yet known  I might as freely as he publickly have declar'd my Thought and the reasons upon which they were grounded and I persuaded to believe That God had left Nations to the Liberty of setting up such Governments as best pleas'd themselves  That Magistrates were set up for the good of Nations not Nations for the honour or glory of Magistrates  That the Right and Power of Magistrates in every Country was that which the Laws of that Country made it to be  That those Laws were to be observ'd and the Oaths taken by them having the force of a Contract between Magistrate and People could not be violated without danger of dissolving the whole Fabrick  That Usurpation could give no Right and the most dangerous of all Enemys to Kings were they who raising their Power to an exorbitant height allow'd to Usurpers all the Rights belonging unto it  That such Usurpations being seldom compass'd without the Slaughter of the Reigning Person or Family the worst of all Villanys was thereby rewarded with the most glorious Privileges  That if such Doctrines were receiv'd they would stir up Men to the Destruct on of Princes with more Violence than all the Passions that have hitherto rag'd in the Hearts of the most Unruly  That none could be safe if such a Reward were propos'd to any that could destro  them  That few would be so gentle as to spare even the Best if by their destruction a wild Usurper could become God's Anointed and by the most execrable Wickedness invest himself with that Divine Character  This is the scope of the whole Treatise the Writer gives such Reasons as at present did occur unto him to prove it This seems to agree  with the Doctrines of the most Reverenc'd Authors of all Times Nations and Religions The best and wisest of Kings have ever acknowledg'd it The present King of  France  has declar'd that Kings have that happy want of Power that they can do nothing contrary to the Laws of their Country and grounds his Quarrel with the King of  Spain Anno  upon that Principle▪ King  James  in his Speech to the Parliament  Anno  doth in the highest degree assert it The Scripture seems to declare it If nevertheless the Writer was mistaken he might have been refuted by Law Reason and Scripture and no Man for such matters was ever otherwise punish'd than by being made to see his Error and it has not as I think been ever known that they had been refer'd to the Judgment of a Jury compos'd of Men utterly unable to comprehend them  But there was little of this in my Case the extravagance of my Prosecutors goes higher the abovemention'd Treatise was never finish'd nor could be in many years and most probably would never have been So much as is of it was written long since never review'd nor shewn to any Man and the fiftieth part of it was not produc'd and not the tenth of that offer'd to be read That which was never known to those who are said to have conspir'd with me was said to be intended to stir up the People in Prosecution of the Designs of those Conspirators  When nothing of particular Application to Time Place or Person could be found in it as has ever been done by those who endeavour'd to raise Insurrections all was supply'd by  Innuendo's  Whatsoever is said of the Expulsion of  Tarquin  the Insurrection against  Nero  the Slaughter of  Caligula  or  Domitian  the Translation of the Crown of  France  from  Meroveus  his Race to  Pepin  and from his Descendents to  Hugh Capet  and the like was apply'd by  Innuendo  to the King  They have not consider'd that if such Acts of State be not good there is not a King in the World that has any Title to the Crown he wears nor can have any unless he could deduce his Pedegree from the eldest Son of  Noah  and shew that the Succession had still continu'd in the eldest of the eldest Line and been so deduc'd to him  Every one may see what advantage this would be to all the Kings of the World and whether that failing it were not better for them to acknowledg they had receiv'd their Crowns by the Consent of willing Nations or to have no better Title to them than Usurpation and Violence which by the same ways may be taken from them  But I was long since told that I must die or the Plot must die  Lest the means of destroying the best Protestants in  England  should fail the Bench must be fill'd with such as had been Blemishes to the Bar  None but such as these would have advis'd with the King's Council of the means of bringing a Man to death suffer'd a Jury to be pack'd by the King's Solicitors and the UnderSheriff admit of Jury men who are not Freeholders receive such Evidence as is above mention d refuse a Copy of an Indictment or suffer the Statute of  Edw  to be read that doth expresly Enact It should in no case be deny'd to any Man upon any occasion whatsoever overrule the most important Points of Law without hearing And whereas the Statute  Ed    upon which they said I should be try'd doth reserve to the Parliament all
