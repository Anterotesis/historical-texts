 ESSAYS BY M  R  GOLDSMITH Collecta revirescunt  Isaac Taylor del et sculp  LONDON  Printed for W GRIFFIN in Fetter Lane MDCCLXV  THE PREFACE  THE following Essays have already appeared at different times and in different publications The pamphlets in which they were inserted being generally unsuccessful these shared the common sate without assisting the bookseller's aims or extending the writer's reputation The public was too strenuously employed with their own follies to be assiduous in estimating mine so that many of my best attempts in this  way have fallen victims to the transient topic of the times the Ghost in Cock Lane or the siege of Ticonderago  But though they have past pretty silently into the world I can by no means complain of their circulation The magazines and papers of the day have indeed been liberal enough in this respect Most of these essays have been regularly reprinted twice or thrice a year and conveyed to the public through the kennel of some engaging compilation If there be a pride in multiplied editions I have seen some of my labours sixteen times reprinted and claimed by different parents as their own I have seen them flourished at the beginning with praise and signed at the end with the names of Philantos  Philalethes Philalutheros and Philanthropos These gentlemen have kindly stood sponsors to my productions and to flatter me more have always past them as their own  It is time however at last to vindicate my claims and as these entertainers of the public as they call themselves have partly lived upon me for some years let me now try if I cannot live a little upon myself I would desire in this case to imitate that fat man who I have somewhere heard of in a shipwreck who when the sailors prest by famine were taking slices from his posteriors to satisfy tkeir hunger insisted with great justice on having the first cut for himself  Yet after all I cannot be angry with any who have taken it into their heads to think that whatever I write is worth reprinting particularly when I consider how great a majority will think it scarce worth reading Trifling and superficial are terms of reproach that are easily objected and that carry an air of penetration in the observer These faults have been objected to the following essays and it must be owned in some measure that the charge is true However I could have made them more metaphysical had I thought fit but I would ask whether in a short essay it is not necessary to be superficial Before we have prepared to enter into the depths of a subject in the usual forms we have got to the bottom of our scanty page and thus lose the  honours of a victory by too tedious a preparation for the combat  There is another fault in this collection of trifles which I fear will not be so easily pardoned It will be alledged that the humour of them if any be found is stale and hackneyed This may be true enough as matters now stand but I may with great truth assert that the humour was new when I wrote it Since that time indeed many of the topics which were first started here have been hunted down and many of the thoughts blown upon In fact these Essays were considered as quietly laid in the grave of oblivion and our modern compilers like sextons and executioners think it their undoubted right to pillage the dead  However whatever right I have to complain of the public they can as yet have no just reason to complain of me If I have written dull Essays they have hitherto treated them as dull Essays Thus far we are at least upon par and until they think fit to make me their humble debtor by praise I am resolved not to lose a single inch of my self importance Instead therefore of attempting to establish a credit amongst them it will perhaps be wiser to apply to some more distant correspondent and as my drafts are in some danger of being protested at home it may not be imprudent upon this occasion to draw my bills upon Posterity Mr Posterity Sir Nine hundred and ninetynine years after sight hereof pay the bearer or order a  thousand pound's worth of praise free from all deductions whatsoever it being a commodity that will then be very serviceable to him and place it to the accompt of  c  ESSAYS  ESSAY I  THERE is not perhaps a more whimsical figure in nature than a man of real modesty who assumes an air of impudence who while his heart beats with anxiety studies ease and affects good humour In this situation however every unexperienced writer finds himself Impressed with the terrors of the tribunal before which he is going to appear his natural humour turns to pertness and for real wit he is obliged to substitute vivacity  FOR my part as I was never distinguished for address and have often even blundered in making my bow I am at a loss whether to be merry or sad on this solemn occasion Should I modestly  decline all merit it is too probable the hasty reader may take me at my word If on the other hand like labourers in the Magazine trade I humbly presume to promise an epitome of all the good things that were ever said or written those readers I most desire to please may forsake me  MY bookseller in this dilemma perceiving my embarrasment instantly offered his assistance and advice  "You must know sir" says he "that the republic of letters is at present divided into several classes One writer excels at a plan or a titlepage another works away the body of the book and a third is a dab at an index Thus a Magazine is not the result of any single man's industry but goes through as many hands as a new pin before it is fit for the public I fancy sir continues he I can provide an eminent hand and upon moderate terms to draw up a promising plan to smooth up our readers a little and pay them as colonel Chartres paid his seraglio at the rate of three halfpence in hand and three shillings more in promises"  HE was proceeding in his advice which however I thought proper to decline by assuring  him that as I intended to pursue no fixed method so it was impossible to form any regular plan determined never to be tedious in order to be logical wherever pleasure presented I was resolved to follow  IT will be improper therefore to pall the reader's curiosity by lessening his surprize or anticipate any pleasure I am able to procure him by saying what shall come next Happy could any effort of mine but repress one criminal pleasure or but for a moment fill up an interval of anxiety How gladly would I lead mankind from the vain prospects of life to prospects of innocence and ease where every breeze breaths health and every sound is but the echo of tranquility  BUT whatever may be the merit of his intentions every writer is now convinced that he must be chiefly indebted to good fortune for finding readers willing to allow him any degree of reputation It has been remarked that almost every character which has excited either attention or pity has owed part of its success to merit and part to an happy concurrence of circumstances in its favour Had Caesar or Cromwell exchanged countries the one might  have been a serjeant and the other an exciseman So it is with wit which generally succeeds more from being happily addressed than from its native poignancy A jest calculated to spread at a gamingtable may be received with perfect indifference should it happen to drop in a mackrelboat We have all seen dunces triumph in some companies where men of real humour were disregarded by a general combination in favour of stupidity To drive the observation as far as it will go should the labours of a writer who designs his performances for readers of a more refined appetite fall into the hands of a devourer of compilations what can he expect but contempt and confusion If his merits are to be determined by judges who estimate the value of a book from its bulk or its frontispiece every rival must acquire an easy superiority who with persuasive eloquence promises four extraordinary pages of letterpress or three beautiful prints curiously coloured from nature  THUS then though I cannot promise as much entertainment or as much elegance as others have done yet the reader may be assured he shall have as much of both as I can He shall at least find me alive while I study his entertainment  for I solemnly assure him I was never yet possessed of the secret of writing and sleeping  DURING the course of this paper therefore all the wit and learning I have are heartily at his service which if after so candid a confession he should notwithstanding still find intolerably dull or low or sad stuff this I protest is no more than I know I have a clear conscience and am entirely out of the secret  YET I would not have him upon the perusal of a single paper pronounce me incorrigible he may try a second which as there is a studied difference in subject and style may be more suited to his taste if this also fails I must refer him to a third or even to a fourth in case of extremity if he should still continue refractory and find me dull to the last I must inform him with Bays in the Rehearsal that I think him a very odd kind of a fellow and desire no more of his acquaintance But still if my readers impute the general tenour of my subject to me as a fault I must beg leave to tell them a story  A TRAVELLER in his way to Italy found himself in a country where the inhabitants had  each a large excresence depending from the chin a deformity which as it was endemic and the people little used to strangers it had been the custom time immemorial to look upon as the greatest beauty Ladies grew toasts from the size of their chins and no men were beaux whose faces were not broadest at the bottom It was Sunday a country church was at hand and our traveller was willing to perform the duties of the day Upon his first appearance at the churchdoor the eyes of all were naturally fixed upon the stranger but what was their amazement when they found that he actually wanted that emblem of beauty a pursed chin Stifled bursts of laughter winks and whispers circulated from visage to visage the prismatic figure of the stranger's face was a fund of infinite gaiety Our traveller could no longer patiently continue an object for deformity to point at  "Good folks" said he "I perceive that I am a very ridiculous figure here but I assure you am reckoned no way deformed at HOME  ESSAY II THE STORY OF  ALCANDER and SEPTIMIUS  Taken from a Byzantine Historian  ATHENS long after the decline of the Roman empire still continued the seat of learning politeness and wisdom Theodoric the Ostrogoth repaired the schools which barbarity was suffering to fall into decay and continued those pensions to men of learning which avaricious governors had monopolized  IN this city and about this period Alcander and Septimius were fellowstudents together The one the most subtle reasoner of all the Lyceum the other the most eloquent speaker in the academic grove Mutual admiration soon begot a friendship Their fortunes were nearly equal and they were natives of the two most celebrated cities in the world for Alcander was of Athens Septimius came from Rome  IN this state of harmony they lived for some time together when Alcander after passing the first part of his youth in the indolence of philosophy thought at length of entering into the busy world and as a step previous to this placed his affections on Hypatia a lady of exquisite beauty The day of their intended nuptials was fixed the previous ceremonies were performed and nothing now remained but her being conducted in triumph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom  ALCANDER's exultation in his own happiness or being unable to enjoy any satisfaction without making his friend Septimius a partner prevailed upon him to introduce Hypatia to his fellowstudent which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found himself equally happy in friendship and love But this was an interview fatal to the future peace of both for Septimius no sooner saw her but he was smitten with an involuntary passion and though he used every effort to suppress desires at once so imprudent and unjust the emotions of his mind in a short time became so strong that they brought on a fever which the physicians judged incurable  DURING this illness Alcander watched him with all the anxiety of fondness and brought his mistress to join in those amiable offices of friendship The sagacity of the physicians by these means soon discovered that the cause of their patient's disorder was love and Alcander being apprized of their discovery at length extorted a confession from the reluctant dying lover  IT would but delay the narrative to describe the conflict between love and friendship in the breast of Alcander on this occasion it is enough to say that the Athenians were at that time arrived at such refinement in morals that every virtue was carried to excess In short forgetful of his own felicity he gave up his intended bride in all her charms to the young Roman They were married privately by his connivance and this unlookedfor change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the constitution of the now happy Septimius In a few days he was perfectly recovered and set out with his fair partner for Rome Here by an exertion of those talents which he was so eminently possessed of Septimius in a few years arrived at the highest dignities of the state and was constituted the cityjudge or praetor  IN the mean time Alcander not only felt the pain of being separated from his friend and his mistress but a prosecution was also commenced against him by the relations of Hypatia for having basely given up his bride as was suggested for money His innocence of the crime laid to his charge and even his eloquence in his own defence were not able to withstand the influence of a powerful party He was cast and condemned to pay an enormous fine However being unable to raise so large a sum at the time appointed his possessions were confiscated he himself was stripped of the habit of freedom exposed as a slave in the marketplace and sold to the highest bidder  A MERCHANT of Thrace becoming his purchaser Alcander with some other companions of distress was carried into that region of desolation and sterility His stated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious master and his success in hunting was all that was allowed him to supply his precarious subsistence Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil and every change of season served but to aggravate his unsheltered distress After some years of bondage however an opportunity of escaping offered he embraced it with ardour  so that travelling by night and lodging in caverns by day to shorten a long story he at last arrived in Rome The same day on which Alcander arrived Septimius sate administering justice in the forum whither our wanderer came expecting to be instantly known and publicly acknowledged by his former friend Here he stood the whole day amongst the crowd watching the eyes of the judge and expecting to be taken notice of but he was so much altered by a long succession of hardships that he continued unnoted among the rest and in the evening when he was going up to the praetor's chair he was brutally repulsed by the attending lictors The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another for night coming on he now found himself under a necessity of seeking a place to lie in and yet knew not where to apply All emaciated and in rags as he was none of the citizens would harbour so much wretchedness and sleeping in the streets might be attended with interruption or danger in short he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city the usual retreat of guilt poverty and despair In this mansion of horror laying his head upon an inverted urn he forgot his miseries for a while in sleep and found on  his flinty couch more ease than beds of down can supply to the guilty  AS he continued here about midnight two robbers came to make this their retreat but happening to disagree about the division of their plunder one of them stabbed the other to the heart and left him weltering in blood at the entrance In these circumstances he was found next morning dead at the mouth of the vault This naturally inducing a further enquiry an alarm was spread the cave was examined and Alcander being found was immediately apprehended and accused of robbery and murder The circumstances against him were strong and the wretchedness of his appearance confirmed suspicion Misfortune and he were now so long acquainted that he at last became regardless of life He detested a world where he had found only ingratitude falshood and cruelty he was determined to make no defence and thus lowering with resolution he was dragged bound with cords before the tribunal of Septimius As the proofs were positive against him and he offered nothing in his own vindication the judge was proceeding to doom him to a most cruel and ignominious death when the attention of the multitude was soon divided by another  object The robber who had been really guilty was apprehended selling his plunder and struck with a panic had confessed his crime He was brought bound to the same tribunal and acquitted every other person of any partnership in his guilt Alcander's innocence therefore appeared but the sullen rashness of his conduct remained a wonder to the surrounding multitude but their astonishment was still farther encreased when they saw their judge start from his tribunal to embrace the supposed criminal Septimius recollected his friend and former benefactor and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy Need the sequel be related Alcander was acquitted shared the friendship and honours of the principal citizens of Rome lived afterwards in happiness and ease and left it to be engraved on his tomb That no circumstances are so desperate which Providence may not relieve  ESSAY III  WHEN I reflect on the unambitious retirement in which I passed the earlier part of my life in the country I cannot avoid feeling some pain in thinking that those happy days are never to return In that retreat all nature seemed capable of affording pleasure I then made no refinements on happiness but could be pleased with the most aukward efforts of rustic mirth thought crosspurposes the highest stretch of human wit and questions and commands the most rational way of spending the evening Happy could so charming an illusion still continue I find that age and knowledge only contribute to sour our dispositions My present enjoyments may be more refined but they are infinitely less pleasing The pleasure the best actor gives can no way compare to that I have received from a country wag who imitated a quaker's sermon The music of the finest singer is dissonance to what I felt when our old dairymaid sung me into tears with Johnny Armstrong's Last Good Night or the Cruelty of Barbara Allen  WRITERS of every age have endeavoured to shew that pleasure is in us and not in the objects offered for our amusement If the soul be happily disposed every thing becomes capable of affording entertaintment and distress will almost want a name Every occcurrence passes in review like the figures of a procession some may be aukward others ill dressed but none but a fool is for this enraged with the master of the ceremonies  I REMEMBER to have once seen a slave in a fortification in Flanders who appeared no way touched with his situation He was maimed deformed and chained obliged to toil from the appearance of day till nightfall and condemned to this for life yet with all these circumstances of apparent wretchedness he sung would have danced but that he wanted a leg and appeared the merriest happiest man of all the garrison What a practical philosopher was here an happy constitution supplied philosophy and though seemingly destitute of wisdom he was really wise No reading or study had contributed to disenchant the fairyland around him Every thing furnished him with an opportunity of mirth and tho' some thought him from his insensibility a fool he  was such an ideot as philosophers should wish to imitate for all philosophy is only forcing the trade of happiness when nature seems to deny the means  THEY who like our slave can place themselves on that side of the world in which every thing appears in a pleasing light will find something in every occurrence to excite their good humour The most calamitous events either to themselves or others can bring no new affliction the whole world is to them a theatre on which comedies only are acted All the bustle of heroism or the rants of ambition serve only to heighten the absurdity of the scene and make the humour more poignant They feel in short as little anguish at their own distress or the complaints of others as the undertaker though dressed in black feels sorrow at a funeral  OF all the men I ever read of the famous cardinal de Retz possessed this happiness of temper in the highest degree As he was a man of gallantry and despised all that wore the pedantic appearance of philosophy wherever pleasure was to be sold he was generally foremost to raise the auction Being an universal admirer  of the fair sex when he found one lady cruel he generally fell in love with another from whom he expected a more favourable reception if she too rejected his addresses he never thought of retiring into desarts or pining in hopeless distress He persuaded himself that instead of loving the lady he only fancied that he had loved her and so all was well again When fortune wore her angriest look and he at last fell into the power of his most deadly enemy cardinal Mazarine being confined a close prisoner in the castle of Valenciennes he never attempted to support his distress by wisdom or philosophy for he pretended to neither He only laughed at himself and his persecutor and seemed infinitely pleased at his new situation In this mansion of distress though secluded from his friends though denied all the amusements and even the conveniencies of life he still retained his good humour laughed at all the little spite of his enemies and carried the jest so far as to be revenged by writing the life of his gaoler  ALL that the wisdom of the proud can teach is to be stubborn or sullen under misfortunes The cardinal's example will instruct us to  rry in circumstances of the highest affliction  It matters not whether our good humour be construed by others into insensibility or even ideotism it is happiness to ourselves and none but a fool would measure his satisfaction by what the world thinks of it for my own part I never pass by one of our prisons for debt that I do not envy that felicity which is still going forward among those people who forget the cares of the world by being shut out from its ambition  THE happiest silly fellow I ever knew was of the number of those goodnatured creatures that are said to do no harm to any but themselves When ever he fell into any misery he usually called it Seeing Life If his head was broke by a chairman or his pocket picked by a sharper he comforted himself by imitating the Hibernian dialect of the one or the more fashionable cant of the other Nothing came amiss to him His inattention to money matters had incensed his father to such a degree that all the intercession of friends in his favour was fruitless The old gentleman was on his deathbed The whole family and Dick among the number gathered around him  "I leave my second son Andrew said the expiring miser my whole estate and desire him  to be frugal  Andrew in a sorrowful tone as is usual on these occasions Prayed Heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it himself  "I recommend Simon my third son to the care of his elder brother and leave him beside four thousand pounds"  "Ah father" cried Simon in great affliction to be sure May Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself"  At last turning to poor Dick  "As for you you have always been a sad dog you'll never come to good you'll never be rich I'll leave you a shilling to buy an halter"  "Ah father" cries Dick without any emotion may Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself"  This was all the trouble the loss of fortune gave this thoughtless imprudent creature However the tenderness of an uncle recompenced the neglect of a father and my friend is now not only excessively goodhumoured but competently rich  YES let the world cry out at a bankrupt who appears at a ball at an author who laughs at the public which pronounces him a dunce at a general who smiles at the reproach of the vulgar or the lady who keeps her goodhumour in spite of scandal but such is the wisest behaviour that any of us can possibly assume  it is certainly a better way to oppose calamity by dissipation than to take up the arms of reason or resolution to oppose it by the first method we forget our miseries by the last we only conceal them from others by struggling with misfortunes we are sure to receive some wounds in the conflict but a sure method to come off victorious is by running away  ESSAY IV  I REMEMBER to have read in some philosopher I believe in Tom Brown's works that let a man's character sentiments or complexion be what they will he can find company in London to match them If he be splenetic he may every day meet companions on the seats in St James's Park with whose groans he may mix his own and pathetically talk of the weather If he be passionate he may vent his rage among the old orators at Slaughter's coffeehouse and damn the nation because it keeps him from starving If he be phlegmatic he may sit in silence at the humdrum club in IvyLane and if actually mad he may find very good company in Moorfields either at Bedlam or the Foundery ready to cultivate a nearer acquaintance  BUT although such as have a knowledge of the town may easily class themselves with tempers congenial to their own a countryman who comes to live in Londom finds nothing more difficult With regard to myself none  ever tried with more assiduity or came off with such indifferent success I spent a whole season in the search during which time my name has been inrolled in societies lodges convocations and meetings without number To some I was introduced by a friend to others invited by an advertisement to these I introduced myself and to those I changed my name to gain admittance In short no coquette was ever more sollicitous to match her ribbons to her complexion than I to suit my club to my temper for I was too obstinate to bring my temper to conform to it  THE first club I entered upon coming to town was that of the Choice Spirits The name was entirely suited to my taste I was a lover of mirth goodhumour and even sometimes of fun from my childhood  AS no other passport was requisite but the payment of two shillings at the door I introduced myself without farther ceremony to the members who were already assembled and had for some time begun upon business The Grand with a mallet in his hand presided at the head of the table I could not avoid upon my entrance making use of all my skill in physiognomy  in order to discover that superiority of genius in men who had taken a title so superior to the rest of mankind I expected to see the lines of every face marked with strong thinking but though I had some skill in this science I could for my life discover nothing but a pert simper fat or profound stupidity  MY speculations were soon interrupted by the Grand who had knocked down Mr Spriggins for a song I was upon this whispered by one of the company who sat next me that I should now see something touched off to a nicety for Mr Spriggins was going to give us Mad Tom in all its glory Mr Spriggins endeavoured to excuse himself for as he was to act a madman and a king it was impossible to go through the part properly without a crown and chains His excuses were overruled by a great majority and with much vociferation The president ordered up the jackchain and instead of a crown our performer covered his brows with an inverted jordan After he had rattled his chain and shook his head to the great delight of the whole company he began his song As I have heard few young fellows offer to sing in company that did not expose themselves it was no great disappointment to  me to find Mr Spriggins among the number however not to seem an odd fish I rose from my seat in rapture cried out Bravo Encore and slapped the table as loud as any of the rest  THE gentleman who sat next me seemed highly pleased with my taste and the ardour of my approbation and whispering told me that I had suffered an immmense loss for had I come a few minutes sooner I might have heard Gee ho Dobbin sung in a tiptop manner by the pimplenosed spirit at the president's right elbow but he was evaporated before I came  AS I was expressing my uneasiness at this disappointment I found the attention of the company employed upon a fat figure who with a voice more rough than the Staffordshire giant's was giving us The Softly Sweet in Lydian Measure of Alexander's Feast After a short pause of admiration to this succeeded a Welch dialogue with the humours of Teague and Taffy after that came on Old Jackson with a story between every stanza next was sung the Dustcart and then Solomon's Song The glass began now to circulate pretty freely those who were silent when sober would now be  heard in their turn every man had his song and he saw no reason why he should not be heard as well as any of the rest one begged to be heard while he gave Death and the Lady in high taste another sung to a plate which he kept trundling on the edges nothing was now heard but singing voice rose above voice and the whole became one universal shout when the landlord came to acquaint the company that the reckoning was drank out Rabelais calls the moments in which a reckoning is mentioned the most melancholy of our lives never was so much noise so quickly quelled as by this short but pathetic oration of our landlord Drank out was ecchoed in a tone of discontent round the table Drank out already that was very odd that so much punch could be drank out already impossible The landlord however seeming resolved not to retreat from his first assurances the company was dissolved and a president chosen for the night ensuing  A FRIEND of mine to whom I was complaining some time after of the entertainment I have been describing proposed to bring me to the club that he frequented which he fancied would suit the gravity of my temper exactly "We have at the Muzzy Club"  says he  "no riotous mirth nor aukward ribaldry no confusion or bawling all is conducted with wisdom and decency besides some of our members are worth forty thousand pounds men of prudence and foresight every one of them these are the proper acquaintance and to such I will tonight introduce you"  I was charmed at the proposal to be acquainted with men worth forty thousand pounds and to talk wisdom the whole night were offers that threw me into rapture  AT seven o'clock I was accordingly introduced by my friend not indeed to the company for though I made my best bow they seemed insensible of my approach but to the table at which they were sitting Upon my entering the room I could not avoid feeling a secret veneration from the solemnity of the scene before me the members kept a profound silence each with a pipe in his mouth and a pewter pot in his hand and with faces that might easily be construed into absolute wisdom Happy society thought I to myself where the members think before they speak deliver nothing rashly but convey their thoughts to each other pregnant with meaning and matured by reflection  IN this pleasing speculation I continued a full half hour expecting each moment that some body would begin to open his mouth every time the pipe was laid down I expected it was to speak but it was only to spit At length resolving to break the charm myself and overcome their extreme diffidence for to this I imputed their silence I rubbed my hands and looking as wise as possible observed that the nights began to grow a little coolish at this time of the year This as it was directed to none of the company in particular none thought himself obliged to answer wherefore I continued still to rub my hands and look wise My next effort was addressed to a gentleman who sat next me to whom I observed that the beer was extreme good my neighbour made no reply but by a large puff of tobaccosmoak  I NOW began to he uneasy in this dumb society till one of them a little relieved me by observing that bread had not risen these three weeks "Ay" says another still keeping the pipe in his mouth  "that puts me in mind of a pleasant story about thathemvery well you must knowbut before I beginSir my service to youwhere was I"  MY next club goes by the name of the Harmonical Society probably from that love of order and friendship which every person commends in institutions of this nature The landlord was himself founder The money spent is four pence each and they sometimes whip for a double reckoning To this club few recommendations are requisite except the introductory four pence and my landlord's good word which as he gains by it he never refuses  WE all here talked and behaved as every body else usually does on his clubnight we discussed the topick of the day drank each others healths snuffed the candles with our fingers and filled our pipes from the same plate of tobacco The company saluted each other in the common manner Mr Bellowsmender hoped Mr Currycombmaker had not caught cold going home the last clubnight and he returned the compliment by hoping that young Master Bellowsmender had got well again of the chincough Doctor Twist told us a story of a parliamentman with whom he was intimately acquainted while the bugman at the same time was telling a better story of a noble lord with whom he could do any thing A gentleman in a black wig and leather breeches  at t'other end of the table was engaged in a long narrative of the Ghost in Cocklane he had read it in the papers of the day and was telling it to some that sat next him who could not read Near him Mr Dibbins was disputing on the old subject of religion with a Jew pedlar over the table while the president vainly knocked down Mr Leathersides for a song Besides the combinations of these voices which I could hear altogether and which formed an upper part to the concert there were several others playing under parts by themselves and endeavouring to fasten on some luckless neighbour's ear who was himself bent upon the same design against some other  WE have often heard of the speech of a corporation and this induced me to transcribe a speech of this club taken in shorthand word for word as it was spoken by every member of the company It may be necessary to observe that the man who told of the ghost had the loudest voice and the longest story to tell so that his continuing narrative filled every chasm in the conversation  "SO Sir d'ye perceive me the ghost giving three loud raps at the bedpostSays my  lord to me My dear Smokeum you know there is no man upon the face of the yearth for whom I have so highA damnable false heretical opinion of all sound doctrine and good learning for I'll tell it aloud and spare not thatSilence for a song Mr Leathersides for a song  'As I was a walking upon the highway I met a young damsel'  Then what brings you here says the parson to the ghost Sanconiathan Manetho and BerosusThe whole way from Islingtonturnpike to DoghousebarDamAs for Abel Drugger Sir he's damn'd low in it my 'prentice boy has more of the gentleman than heFor murder will out one time or another and none but a ghost you know gentlemen canDamme if I don't for my friend whom you know gentlemen and who is a parliamentman a man of consequence a dear honest creature to be sure we were laughing last night atDeath and damnation upon all his posterity by simply barely tastingSour grapes as the fox said once when he could not reach them and I'll I'll tell you a story about that that will make you burst your sides with laughing A fox onceWill no body listen to the song  'As I was a walking upon the highway I met a young damsel both buxom and gay'  No ghost gentlemen  can be murdered nor did I ever hear but of one ghost killed in all my life and that was stabbed in the belly with aMy blood and soul if I don'tMr Bellowsmender I have the honour of drinking your very good health Blast me if I dodambloodbugsfire whizzblidtitrattrip"The rest all riot nonsense and rapid confusion  WERE I to be angry at men for being fools I could here find ample room for declamation but alas I have been a fool myself and why should I be angry with them for being fomething so natural to every child of humanity  FATIGUED with this society I was introduced the following night to a club of fashion On taking my place I found the conversation sufficiently easy and tolerably goodnatured for my lord and Sir Paul were not yet arrived I now thought myself completely fitted and resolving to seek no farther determined to take up my residence here for the winter while my temper began to open insensibly to the chearfulness I saw diffused on every face in the room but the delusion soon vanished when the waiter came to apprize us that his lordship and Sir Paul were just arrived  FROM this moment all our felicity was at an end our new guests bustled into the room and took their seats at the head of the table Adieu now all confidence every creature strove who should most recommend himself to our members of distinction Each seemed quite regardless of pleasing any but our new guests and what before wore the appearance of friendship was now turned into rivalry  YET I could not observe that amidst all this flattery and obsequious attention our great men took any notice of the rest of the company Their whole discourse was addressed to each other Sir Paul told his lordship a long story of Moravia the Jew and his lordship gave Sir Paul a very long account of his new method of managing silkworms he led him and consequently the rest of the company through all the stages of feeding sunning and hatching with an episode on mulberrytrees a digression upon grass seeds and a long parenthesis about his new postilion In this manner we travelled on wishing every story to be the last but all in vain  "Hills over hills and Alps on Alps arose"  THE last club in which I was inrolled a member was a society of moral philosophers as they called themselves who assembled twice a week in order to shew the absurdity of the present mode of religion and establish a new one in its stead  I FOUND the members very warmly disputeing when I arrived not indeed about religion or ethics but about who had neglected to lay down his preliminary sixpence upon entering the room The president swore that he had laid his own down and so swore all the company  DURING this contest I had an opportunity of observing the laws and also the members of the society The president who had been as I was told lately a bankrupt was a tall pale figure with a long black wig the next to him was dressed in a large white wig and a black cravat a third by the brownness of his complexion seemed a native of Jamaica and a fourth by his hue appeared to be a blacksmith But their rules will give the most just idea of their learning and principles  I WE being a laudable society of moral philosophers intends to dispute twice a week  about religion and priestcraft Leaving behind us old wives tales and following good learning and sound sense and if so be that any other persons has a mind to be of the society they shall be entitled so to do upon paying the sum of three shillings to be spent by the company in punch  II THAT no member get drunk before nine of the clock upon pain of forfeiting three pence to be spent by the company in punch  III THAT as members are sometimes apt to go away without paying every person shall pay sixpence upon his entering the room and all disputes shall be settled by a majority and all fines shall be paid in punch  IV THAT sixpence shall be every night given to the president in order to buy books of learning for the good of the society the president has already put himself to a good deal of expence in buying books for the club particularly the works of Tully Socrates and Cicero which he will soon read to the society  V ALL them who brings a new argument against religion and who being a philosopher  and a man of learning as the rest of us is shall be admitted to the freedom of the society upon paying sixpence only to be spent in punch  VI WHENEVER we are to have an extraordinary meeting it shall be advertised by some outlandish name in the newspapers  Saunders Mac Wild president  Anthony Blewit vicepresident his {inverted †} mark  William Turpin secretary  ESSAY V  IT is usually said by grammarians that the use of language is to express our wants and desires but men who know the world hold and I think with some shew of reason that he who best knows how to keep his necessities private is the most likely person to have them redressed and that the true use of speech is not so much to express our wants as to conceal them  WHEN we reflect on the manner in which mankind generally confer their favours there appears something so attractive in riches that the large heap generally collects from the smaller and the poor find as much pleasure in encreasing the enormous mass of the rich as the miser who owns it sees happiness in its encrease Nor is there in this any thing repugnant to the laws of morality Seneca himself allows that in conferring benefits the present should always be suited to the dignity of the receiver Thus the rich receive large presents and are thanked for accepting them Men of middling stations are obliged to be content with presents something  less while the beggar who may be truly said to want indeed is well paid if a farthing rewards his warmest solicitations  EVERY man who has seen the world and has had his ups and downs in life as the expression is must have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine and must know that to have much or to seem to have it is the only way to have more Ovid finely compares a man of broken fortune to a falling column the lower it sinks the greater weight it is obliged to sustain Thus when a man's circumstances are such that he has no occasion to borrow he finds numbers willing to lend him but should his wants be such that he sues for a trifle it is two to one whether he may be trusted with the smallest sum A certain young fellow whom I knew whenever he had occasion to ask his friend for a guinea used to prelude his request as if he wanted two hundred and talked so familiarly of large sums that none could ever think he wanted a small one The same gentleman whenever he wanted credit for a suit of cloaths always made the proposal in a laced coat for he found by experience that if he appeared shabby on these occasions his taylor had taken an oath against trusting or what  was every whit as bad his foreman was out of the way and should not be at home for some time  THERE can be no inducement to reveal our wants except to find pity and by this means relief but before a poor man opens his mind in such circumstances he should first consider whether he is contented to lose the esteem of the person he solicits and whether he is willing to give up friendship to excite compassion Pity and friendship are passions incompatible with each other and it is impossible that both can reside in any breast for the smallest space without impairing each other Friendship is made up of esteem and pleasure pity is composed of sorrow and contempt the mind may for some time fluctuate between them but it can never entertain both at once  IN fact pity though it may often relieve is but at best a shortlived passion and seldom affords distress more than transitory assistance with some it scarce lasts from the first impulse till the hand can be put into the pocket with others it may continue for twice that space and on some of extraordinary sensibility I have seen it operate for half an hour together but  still last as it may it generally produces but beggarly effects and where from this motive we give five farthings from others we give pounds whatever be our feelings from the first impulse of distress when the same distress solicits a second time we then feel with diminished sensibility and like the repetition of an eccho every stroke becomes weaker till at last our sensations lose all mixture of sorrow and degenerate into downright contempt  THESE speculations bring to my mind the sate of a very good natured fellow who is now no more He was bred in a comptinghouse and his father dying just as he was out of his time left him an handsome fortune and many friends to advise with The restraint in which my friend had been brought up had thrown a gloom upon his temper which some regarded as prudence and from such considerations he had every day repeated offers of friendship Such as had money were ready to offer him their assistance that way and they who had daughters frequently in the warmth of affection advised him to marry My friend however was in good circumstances he wanted neither money friends nor a wife and therefore modestly declined their proposals  SOME errors however in the management of his affairs and several losses in trade soon brought him to a different way of thinking and he at last considered that it was his best way to let his friends know that their offers were at length acceptable His first address was to a scrivener who had formerly made him frequent offers of money and friendship at a time when perhaps he knew those offers would have been refused As a man therefore confident of not being refused he requested the use of an hundred guineas for a few days as he just then had occasion for money  "And pray Sir replied the scrivener "do you want all this money"  "Want it Sir" says the other "If I did not want it I should not have asked it"  "I am sorry for that" says the friend "for those who want money when they borrow will always want money when they should come to pay To say the truth Sir money is money now and I believe it is all sunk in the bottom of the sea for my part he that has got a little is a fool if he does not keep what he has got"  NOT quite disconcerted by this refusal our adventurer was resolved to apply to another whom he knew was the very best friend he had  in the world The gentleman whom he now addressed received his proposal with all the affability that could be expected from generous friendship  "Let me see you want an hundred guineas and pray dear Jack would not fifty answer"  "If you have but fifty to spare Sir I must be contented"  "Fifty to spare I do not say that for I believe I have but twenty about me"  "Then I must borrow the other thirty from some other friend"  "And pray" replied the friend "would it not be the best way to borrow the whole money from that other friend and then one note will serve for all you know You know my dear Sir that you need make no ceremony with me at any time you know I'm your friend and when you chuse a bit of dinner or soYou Tom see the gentleman down You won't forget to dine with us now and then Your very humble servant"  DISTRESSED but not discouraged at this treatment he was at last resolved to find that assistance from love which he could not have from friendship A young lady a distant relation by the mother's side had a fortune in her own hands and as she had already made all  the advances that her sex's modesty would permit he made his proposal with confidence He soon however perceived That no bankrupt ever found the fair one kind She had lately fallen deeply in love with another who had more money and the whole neighbourhood thought it would be a match  EVERY day now began to strip my poor friend of his former finery his cloaths flew piece by piece to the pawnbroker's and he seemed at length equipped in the genuine livery of misfortune But still he thought himself secure from actual necessity the numberless invitations he had received to dine even after his losses were yet unanswered he was therefore now resolved to accept of a dinner because he wanted one and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week without being openly affronted The last place I saw him in was at a reverend divine's He had as he fancied just nicked the time of dinner for he came in as the cloth was laying He took a chair without being desired and talked for some time without being attended to He assured the company that nothing procured so good an appetite as a walk in the Park where he had been that morning He went on and praised the  figure of the damask tablecloth talked of a feast where he had been the day before but that the venison was overdone But all this procured him no invitation finding therefore the gentleman of the house insensible to all his fetches he thought proper at last to retire and mend his appetite by a second walk in the Park  YOU then O ye beggars of my acquaintance whether in rags or lace whether in Kentstreet or the Mall whether at the Smyrna or St Giles's might I be permitted to advise as a friend never seem to want the favour which you solicit Apply to every passion but human pity for redress you may find permanent relief from vanity from selfinterest or from avarice but from compassion never The very eloquence of a poor man is disgusting and that mouth which is opened even by wisdom is seldom expected to close without the horrors of a petition  TO ward off the gripe of poverty you must pretend to be a stranger to her and she will at least use you with ceremony If you be caught dining upon a halfpenny porrenger of peasesoup and potatoes praise the wholesomness of your  frugal repast You may observe that Dr Cheyne has prescribed peasebroth for the gravel hint that you are not one of those who are always making a deity of your belly If again you are obliged to wear a flimsy stuff in the midst of winter be the first to remark that stuffs are very much worn at Paris or if there be found some irreparable defects in any part of your equipage which cannot be concealed by all the arts of sitting crosslegged coaxing or derning say that neither you nor Sampson Gideon were ever very fond of dress If you be a philosopher hint that Plato or Seneca are the taylors you choose to employ assure the company that man ought to be content with a bare covering since what now is so much his pride was formerly his shame In short however caught never give out but ascribe to the frugality of your disposition what others might be apt to attribute to the narrowness of your circumstances To be poor and to seem poor is a certain method never to rise pride in the great is hateful in the wise it is ridiculous but beggarly pride is a rational vanity which I have been taught to applaud and excuse  ESSAY VI  LYSIPPUS is a man whose greatness of soul the whole world admires His generosity is such that it prevents a demand and saves the receiver the trouble and the confusion of a request His liberality also does not oblige more by its greatness than by his inimitable grace in giving Sometimes he even distributes his bounties to strangers and has been known to do good offices to those who professed themselves his enemies All the world are unanimous in the praise of his generosity there is only one sort of people who complain of his conduct Lysippus does not pay his debts  IT is no difficult matter to account for a conduct so seemingly incompatible with itself There is greatness in being generous and there is only simple justice in his satisfying creditors Generosity is the part of a soul raised above the vulgar There is in it something of what we admire in heroes and praise with a degree of rapture Justice on the contrary is a mere mechanic virtue only sit for tradesmen and  what is practised by every broker in 'Changealley  IN paying his debts a man barely does his duty and it is an action attend  d with no sort of glory Should Lysippus sa  isfy his creditors who would be at the pains of telling it to the world Generosity is a virtue of a very different complexion It is raised above duty and from its elevation attracts the attention and the praises of us little morta  s below  IN this manner do men generally reason upon justice and generosity The first is despised though a virtue essential to the good of society and the other attracts our esteem which too frequently proceeds from an impetuosity of temper rather directed by vanity than reason Lysippus is told that his banker asks a debt of forty pounds and that a distressed acquaintance petitions for the same sum He gives it without hesitating to the latter for he demands as a favour what the former requires as a debt  MANKIND in general are not sufficiently acquainted with the import of the word Justice it is commonly believed to consist only in a performance of those duties to which the laws of  society can oblige us This I allow is sometimes the import of the word and in this sense justice is distinguished from equity but there is a justice still more extensive and which can be shewn to embrace all the virtues united  JUSTICE may be defined that virtue which impels us to give to every person what is his due In this extended sense of the word it comprehends the practice of every virtue which reason prescribes or society should expect Our duty to our maker to each other and to ourselves are fully answered if we give them what we owe them Thus justice properly speaking is the only virtue and all the rest have their origin in it  THE qualities of candour fortitude charity and generosity for instance are not in their own nature virtues and if ever they deserve the title it is owing only to justice which impels and directs them Without such a moderator candour might become indiscretion fortitude obstinacy charity imprudence and generosity mistaken profusion  A DISINTERESTED action if it be not conducted by justice is at best indifferent  in its nature and not unfrequently even turns to vice The expences of society of presents of entertainments and the other helps to chearfulness are actions merely indifferent when not repugnant to a better method of disposing of our superfluities but they become vicious when they obstruct or exhaust our abilities from a more virtuous disposition of our circumstances  TRUE generosity is a duty as indispensibly necessary as those imposed upon us by law It is a rule imposed upon us by reason which should be the sovereign law of a rational being But this generosity does not consist in obeying every impulse of humanity in following blind passion for our guide and impairing our circumstances by present benefactions so as to render us incapable of future ones  MISERS are generally characterized as men without honour or without humanity who live only to accumulate and to this passion sacrifice every other happiness They have been described as madmen who in the midst of abundance banish every pleasure and make from imaginary wants real necessities But few very few correspond to this exaggerated  picture and perhaps there is not one in whom all these circumstances are found united Instead of this we find the sober and the industrious branded by the vain and the idle with this odious appellation Men who by frugality and labour raise themselves above their equals and contribute their share of industry to the common stock  WHATEVER the vain or the ignorant may say well were it for society had we more of these characters amongst us In general these close men are found at last the true benefactors of society With an avaricious man we seldom lose in our dealings but too frequently in our commerce with prodigality  A FRENCH priest whose name was Godinot went for a long time by the name of the Griper He refused to relieve the most apparent wretchedness and by a skilful management of his vineyard had the good fortune to acquire immense sums of money The inhabitants of Rheims who were his fellowcitizens detested him and the populace who seldom love a miser wherever he went followed him with shouts of contempt He still however continued his former simplicity of life his amazing and unremitted  frugality He had long perceived the wants of the poor in the city particularly in having no water but what they were obliged to buy at an advanced price wherefore that whole fortune which he had been amassing he laid out in an aqueduct by which he did the poor more useful and lasting service than if he had distributed his whole income in charity every day at his door  AMONG men long conversant with books we too frequently find those misplaced virtues of which I have been now complaining We find the studious animated with a strong passion for the great virtues as they are mistakenly called and utterly forgetful of the ordinary ones The declamations of philosophy are generally rather exhausted on those supererogatory duties than on such as are indispensably necessary A man therefore who has taken his ideas of mankind from study alone generally comes into the world with an heart melting at every fictitious distress Thus he is induced by misplaced liberality to put himself into the indigent circumstances of the person he relieves  I SHALL conclude this paper with the advice of one of the antients to a young man whom  he saw giving away all his substance to pretended distress  "It is possible that the person you relieve may be an honest man and I know that you who relieve him are such You see then by your generosity that you rob a man who is certainly deserving to bestow it on one who may possibly be a rogue and while you are unjust in rewarding uncertain merit you are doubly guilty by striping yourself"  ESSAY VII  NB This treatise was published before Rousseau's Emilius if there be a similitude in any one instance it is hoped the author of the present essay will not be deemed a plagiarist  AS few subjects are more interesting to society so few have been more frequently written upon than the education of youth Yet it is a little surprizing that it has been treated almost by all in a declamatory manner They have insisted largely on the advantages that result from it both to individuals and to society and have expatiated in the praise of what none have ever been so hardy as to call in question  INSTEAD of giving us fine but empty harangues upon this subject instead of indulging each his particular and whimsical systems it had been much better if the writers on this subject had treated it in a more scientific manner repressed all the sallies of imagination and  given us the result of their observations with didactic simplicity Upon this subject the smallest errors are of the most dangerous consequence and the author should venture the imputation of stupidity upon a topic where his slightest deviations may tend to injure the rising generation However such are the whimsical and erroneous productions written upon this subject Their authors have studied to be uncommon not to be just and at present we want a treatise upon education not to tell us any thing new but to explode the errors which have been introduced by the admirers of novelty It is in this manner books become numerous a desire of novelty produces a book and other books are required to destroy the former  I SHALL therefore throw out a few thoughts upon this subject which though known have not been attended to by others and shall dismiss all attempts to please while I study only instruction  THE manner in which our youth of London are at present educated is some in freeschools in the city but the far greater number in boardingschools about town The parent justly consults the health of his child and finds  an education in the country tends to promote this much more than a continuance in town Thus far he is right if there were a possibility of having even our freeschools kept a little out of town it would certainly conduce to the health and vigour of perhaps the mind as well as the body It may be thought whimsical but it is truth I have found by experience that they who have spent all their lives in cities contract not only an effeminacy of habit but even of thinking  BUT when I have said that the boardingschools are preferable to freeschools as being in the country this is certainly the only advantage I can allow them otherwise it is impossible to conceive the ignorance of those who take upon them the important trust of education Is any man unfit for any of the professions he finds his last resource in setting up a school Do any become bankrupts in trade they still set up a boardingschool and drive a trade this way when all others fail nay I have been told of butchers and barbers who have turned schoolmasters and more surprising still made fortunes in their new profession  COULD we think ourselves in a country of civilized people could it be conceived that we  have any regard for posterity when such are permitted to take the charge of the morals genius and health of those dear little pledges who may one day be the guardians of the liberties of Europe and who may serve as the honour and bulkwark of their aged parents The care of our children is it below the state Is it fit to indulge the caprice of the ignorant with the disposal of their children in this particular For the state to take the charge of all its children as in Persia or Sparta might at present be inconvenient but surely with great ease it might cast an eye to their instructors Of all professions in society I do not know a more useful or a more honourable one than a schoolmaster at the same time that I do not see any more generally despised or whose talents are so ill rewarded  WERE the salaries of schoolmasters to be augmented from a diminution of useless sinecures how might it turn to the advantage of this people a people whom without flattery I may in other respects term the wisest and greatest upon earth But while I would reward the deserving I would dismiss those utterly unqualified for their employment in short I would make the business of a schoolmaster  every way more respectable by encreasing their salaries and admitting only men of proper abilities  IT is true we have already schoolmasters appointed and they have some small salaries but where at present there is only one schoolmaster appointed there should at least be two and wherever the salary is at present twenty pounds it should be an hundred Do we give immoderate benefices to those who instruct ourselves and shall we deny even subsistence to those who instruct our children Every member of society should be paid in proportion as he is necessary and I will be bold enough to say that schoolmasters in a state are more necessary than clergymen as children stand in more need of instruction than their parents  BUT instead of this as I have already observed we send them to board in the country to the most ignorant set of men that can be imagined But least the ignorance of the master be not sufficient the child is generally consigned to the usher This is commonly some poor needy animal little superior to a footman either in learning or spirit invited to his place by an advertisement and kept there merely  from his being of a complying disposition and making the children fond of him  "You give your child to be educated to a slave" says a philosopher to a rich man "instead of one slave you will then have two"  IT were well however if parents upon fixing their children in one of these houses would examine the abilities of the usher as well as the master for whatever they are told to the contrary the usher is generally the person most employed in their education If then a gentleman upon putting out his son to one of these houses sees the usher disregarded by the master he may depend upon it that he is equally disregarded by the boys the truth is in spite of all their endeavours to please they are generally the laughingstock of the school Every trick is played upon the usher the oddity of his manners his dress or his language are a fund of eternal ridicule the master himself now and then cannot avoid joining in the laugh and the poor wretch eternally resenting this ill usage seems to live in a state of war with all the family This is a very proper person is it not to give children a relish for learning They must esteem learning very much when they see its professors used with such little  ceremony If the usher be despised the father may be assured his child will never be properly instructed  BUT let me suppose that there are some schools without these inconveniencies where the masters and ushers are men of learning reputation and assiduity If there are to be found such they cannot be prized in a state sufficiently A boy will learn more true wisdom in a public school in a year than by a private education in five It is not from masters but from their equals youth learn a knowledge of the world the little tricks they play each other the punishment that frequently attends the commission is a just picture of the great world and all the ways of men are practised in a public school in miniature It is true a child is early made acquainted with some vices in a school but it is better to know these when a boy than be first taught them when a man for their novelty then may have irresistible charms  IN a public education boys early learn temperance and if the parents and friends would give them less money upon their usual visits it would be much to their advantage since it  may justly be said that a great part of their disorders arise from surfeit Plus occidit gula quam gladius And now I am come to the article of health it may not be amiss to observe that Mr Locke and some others have advised that children should be inured to cold to fatigue and hardship from their youth but Mr Locke was but an indifferent physician Habit I grant has great influence over our constitutions but we have not precise ideas upon this subject  WE know that among savages and even among our peasants there are found children born with such constitutions that they cross rivers by swimming endure cold thirst hunger and want of sleep to a surprising degree that when they happen to fall sick they are cured without the help of medicine by nature alone Such examples are adduced to persuade us to imitate their manner of education and accustom ourselves betimes to support the same fatigues But had these gentlemen considered first how many lives are lost in this ascetic practice had they considered that those savages and peasants are generally not so long lived as they who have led a more indolent life that the more laborious the life is the less populous is the country had  they considered that what physicians call the Stamina Vitae by fatigue and labour become rigid and thus anticipate old age that the number who survive those rude trials bears no proportion to those who die in the experiment Had these things been properly considered they would not have thus extolled an education begun in fatigue and hardships Peter the Great willing to enure the children of his seamen to a life of hardship ordered that they should only drink seawater but they unfortunately all died under the trial  BUT while I would exclude all unnecessary labours yet still I would recommend temperance in the highest degree No luxurious dishes with high seasoning nothing given children to force an appetite as little sugared or salted provisions as possible though ever so pleasing but milk morning and night should be their constant food This diet would make them more healthy than any of those slops that are usually cooked by the mistress of a boardingschool besides it corrects any consumptive habits not unfrequently found amongst the children of city parents  AS boys should be educated with temperance so the first greatest lesson that should  be taught them is to admire frugality It is by the exercise of this virtue alone they can ever expect to be useful members of society It is true lectures continually repeated upon this subject may make some boys when they grow up run into an extreme and become misers but it were well had we more misers than we have among us I know few characters more useful in society for a man's having a larger or smaller share of money lying useless by him no way injures the commonwealth since should every miser now exhaust his stores this might make gold more plenty but it would not encrease the commodities or pleasures of life they would still remain as they are at present it matters not therefore whether men are misers or not if they be only frugal laborious and fill the station they have chosen If they deny themselves the necessaries of life society is no way injured by their folly  INSTEAD therefore of romances which praise young men of spirit who go through a variety of adventures and at last conclude a life of dissipation folly and extravagance in riches and matrimony there should be some men of wit employed to compose books that might equally interest the passions of our youth where  such an one might be praised for having resisted allurements when young and how he at last became lordmayor how he was married to a lady of great sense fortune and beauty to be as explicit as possible the old story of Whittington were his cat left out might be more serviceable to the tender mind than either Tom Jones Joseph Andrews or an hundred others where frugality is the only good quality the hero is not possessed of Were our schoolmasters if any of them have sense enough to draw up such a work thus employed it would be much more serviceable to their pupils than all the grammars and dictionaries they may publish these ten years  CHILDREN should early be instructed in the arts from which they may afterwards draw the greatest advantages When the wonders of nature are never exposed to our view we have no great desire to become acquainted with those parts of learning which pretend to account for the phaenomena One of the antients complains that as soon as young men have left school and are obliged to converse in the world they fancy themselves transported into a new region  "Ut cum in forum venerint existiment se in aliam terrarum orbem delatos"  We should early therefore instruct them in the experiments if I may so express it of knowledge and leave to maturer age the accounting for the causes But instead of that when boys begin natural philosophy in colleges they have not the least curiosity for those parts of the science which are proposed for their instruction they have never before seen the phaenomena and consequently have no curiosity to learn the reasons Might natural philosophy therefore be made their pastime in school by this means it would in college become their amusement  IN several of the machines now in use there would be ample field both for instruction and amusement the different sorts of the phosphorus the artificial pyrites magnetism electricity the experiments upon the rarefaction and weight of the air and those upon elastic bodies might employ their idle hours and none should be called from play to see such experiments but such as thought proper At first then it would be sufficient if the instruments and the effects of their combination were only shewn the causes should be deferred to a maturer age or to those times when natural curiosity prompts us to discover the wonders of nature Man is placed in this world as a spectator when he is  tired of wondering at all the novelties about him and not till then does he desire to be made acquainted with the causes that create those wonders  WHAT I have observed with regard to natural philosophy I would extend to every other science whatsoever We should teach them as many of the facts as were possible and defer the causes until they seemed of themselves desirous of knowing them A mind thus leaving school stored with all the simple experiences of science would be the fittest in the world for the college course and though such a youth might not appear so bright or so talkative as those who had learned the real principles and causes of some of the sciences yet he would make a wiser man and would retain a more lasting passion for letters than he who was early burdened with the disagreeable institution of effect and cause  IN history such stories alone should be laid before them as might catch the imagination instead of this they are too frequently obliged to toil through the four empires as they are called where their memories are burdened by a number of disgusting names that destroy all  their future relish for our best historians who may be termed the truest teachers of wisdom  EVERY species of flattery should be carefully avoided a boy who happens to say a sprightly thing is generally applauded so much that he sometimes continues a coxcomb all his life after He is reputed a wit at fourteen and becomes a blockhead at twenty Nurses footmen and such should therefore be driven away as much as possible I was even going to add that the mother herself should stifle her pleasure or her vanity when little master happens to say a good or a smart thing Those modest lubberly boys who seem to want spirit generally go through their business with more ease to themselves and more satisfaction to their instructors  THERE has of late a gentleman appeared who thinks the study of rhetoric essential to a perfect education That bold male eloquence which often without pleasing convinces is generally destroyed by such institutions Convincing eloquence is infinitely more serviceable to its possessor than the most florid harangue or the most pathetic tones that can be imagined and the man who is thoroughly convinced  himself who understands his subject and the language he speaks in will be more apt to silence opposition than he who studies the force of his periods and fills our ears with sounds while our minds are destitute of conviction  IT was reckoned the fault of the orators at the decline of the Roman empire when they had been long instructed by rhetoricians that their periods were so harmonious as that they could be sung as well as spoken What a ridiculous figure must one of these gentlemen cut thus measuring syllables and weighing words when he should plead the cause of his client Two architects were once candidates for the building a certain temple at Athens the first harangued the crowd very learnedly upon the different orders of architecture and shewed them in what manner the temple should be built the other who got up after him only observed that what his brother had spoken he could do and thus he at once gained his cause  TO teach men to be orators is little less than to teach them to be poets and for my part I should have too great a regard for my  child to wish him a manor only in a bookseller's shop  ANOTHER passion which the present age is apt to run into is to make children learn all things the languages the sciences music the exercises and painting Thus the child soon becomes a Talker in all but a Master in none He thus acquires a superficial fondness for every thing and only shews his ignorance when he attempts to exhibit his skill  AS I deliver my thoughts without method or connection so the reader must not be surprized to find me once more addressing schoolmasters on the present method of teaching the learned languages which is commonly by literal translations I would ask such if they were to travel a journey whether those parts of the road in which they found the greatest difficulties would not be the most strongly remembered Boys who if I may continue the allusion gallop through one of the antients with the assistance of a translation can have but a very slight acquaintance either with the author or his language It is by the exercise of the mind alone that a language is learned but a literal translation on the opposite page leaves no exercise  for the memory at all The boy will not be at the fatigue of remembering when his doubts are at once satisfied by a glance of the eye whereas were every word to be sought from a dictionary the learner would attempt to remember them to save himself the trouble of looking out for it for the future  TO continue in the same pedantic strain of all the various grammars now taught in the schools about town I would recommend only the old common one I have forgot whether Lily's or an emendation of him The others may be improvements but such improvements seem to me only mere grammatical niceties no way influencing the learner but perhaps loading him with trifling subtilties which at a proper age he must be at some pains to forget  WHATEVER pains a master may take to make the learning of the languages agreeable to his pupil he may depend upon it it will be at first extremely unpleasant The rudiments of every language therefore must be given as a task not as an amusement Attempting to deceive children into instruction of this kind is only deceiving ourselves and I know no passion  capable of conquering a child's natural laziness but fear Solomon has said it before me nor is there any more certain though perhaps more disagreeable truth than the proverb in verse too well known to repeat on the present occasion It is very probable that parents are told of some masters who never use the rod and consequently are thought the properest instructors for their children but though tenderness is a requisite quality in an instructor yet there is too often the truest tenderness in welltimed correction  SOME have justly observed that all passion should be banished on this terrible occasion but I know not how there is a frailty attending humannature that few masters are able to keep their temper whilst they correct I knew a goodnatured man who was sensible of his own weakness in this respect and consequently had recourse to the following expedient to prevent his passions from being engaged yet at the same time administer justice with impartiality Whenever any of his pupils committed a fault he summoned a jury of his peers I mean of the boys of his own or the next classes to him his accusers stood forth he had liberty of pleading in his own defence and one or two more had  the liberty of pleading against him when found guilty by the panel he was consigned to the footman who attended in the house and had previous orders to punish but with lenity By this means the master took off the odium of punishment from himself and the footman between whom and the boys there could not be even the slightest intimacy was placed in such a light as to be shunned by every boy in the school  ESSAY VIII  AN alehousekeeper near Islington who had long lived at the sign of the French King upon the commencement of the last war with France pulled down his old sign and put up that of the queen of Hungary Under the influence of her red face and golden sceptre he continued to sell ale till she was no longer the favourite of his customers he changed her therefore some time ago for the king of Prussia who may probably be changed in turn for the next great man that shall be set up for vulgar admiration  OUR publican in this imitates the great exactly who deal out their figures one after the other to the gazing crowd When we have sufficiently wondered at one that is taken in and another exhibited in its room which seldom holds its station long for the mob are ever pleased with variety  I MUST own I have such an indifferent opinion of the vulgar that I am ever led to  suspect that merit which raises their shout at least I am certain to find those great and sometimes good men who find satisfaction in such acclamations made worse by it and history has too frequently taught me that the head which has grown this day giddy with the roar of the million has the very next been fixed upon a pole  AS Alexander VI was entering a little town in the neighbourhood of Rome which had been just evacuated by the enemy he perceived the townsmen busy in the marketplace in pulling down from a gibbet a figure which had been designed to represent himself There were some also knocking down a neighbouring statue of one of the Orsini family with whom he was at war in order to put Alexander's effigy in its place It is possible a man who knew less of the world would have condemned the adulation of those barefaced flatterers but Alexander seemed pleased at their zeal and turning to Borgia his son said with a smile  "Vides mi sili quam leve discriminem palibulum inter et statuum"  "You see my son the small difference between a gibbet and a statue"  If the great could be taught any lesson this might serve to teach them upon  how weak a foundation their glory stands which is built upon popular applause for as such praise what seems like merit they as quickly condemn what has only the appearance of guilt  POPULAR glory is a perfect coquet her lovers must toil feel every inquietude indulge every caprice and perhaps at last be jilted into the bargain True glory on the other hand resembles a woman of sense her admirers must play no tricks they feel no great anxiety for they are sure in the end of being rewarded in proportion to their merit When Swift used to appear in public he generally had the mob shouting in his train  "Pox take these fools" he would say "how much joy might all this bawling give my lordmayor"  WE have seen those virtues which have while living retired from the public eye generally transmitted to posterity as the truest objects of admiration and praise Perhaps the character of the late duke of Marlborough may one day be set up even above that of his more talked of predecessor since an assemblage of all the mild and amiable virtues are far superior  to those vulgarly called the great ones I must be pardoned for this short tribute to the memory of a man who while living would as much detest to receive any thing that wore the appearance of flattery as I should to offer it  I KNOW not how to turn so trite a subject out of the beaten road of common place except by illustrating it rather by the assistance of my memory than judgment and instead of making reflections by telling a story  A CHINESE who had long studied the works of Confucius who knew the characters of fourteen thousand words and could read a great part of every book that came in his way once took it into his head to travel into Europe and observe the customs of a people whom he thought not very much inferior even to his own countrymen in the arts of refining upon every pleasure Upon his arrival at Amsterdam his passion for letters naturally led him to a bookseller's shop and as he could speak a little Dutch he civilly asked the bookseller for the works of the immortal Xixofou The bookseller assured him he had never heard the book mentioned before "What have you never heard of that immortal poet" returned  the other much surprized  "that light of the eyes that favourite of kings that rose of perfection I suppose you know nothing of the immortal Fipsihihi second cousin to the moon"  "Nothing at all indeed Sir"  returned the other  "Alas" cries our traveller "to what purpose then has one of these fasted to death and the other offered himself up as a sacrifice to the Tartar enemy to gain a renown which has never travelled beyond the precincts of China"  THERE is scarce a village in Europe and not one university that is not thus furnished with its little great men The head of a petty corporation who opposes the designs of a prince who would tyrannically force his subjects to save their best cloaths for Sundays the puny pedant who finds one undiscovered property in the polype or describes an unheeded process in the skeleton of a mole and whose mind like his microscope perceives nature only in detail the rhymer who makes smooth verses and paints to our imagination when he should only speak to our hearts all equally fancy themselves walking forward to immortality and desire the crowd behind them to look on The crowd takes them at their word Patriot  philosopher and poet are shouted in their train  "Where was there ever so much merit seen no times so important as our own ages yet unborn shall gaze with wonder and applause  To such music the important pigmy moves forward bustling and swelling and aptly compared to a puddle in a storm  I HAVE lived to see generals who once had crowds halloing after them wherever they went who were bepraised by newspapers and magazines those ecchoes of the voice of the vulgar and yet they have long sunk into merited obscurity with scarce even an epitaph left to flatter A few years ago the herringfishery employed all Grubstreet it was the topic in every coffeehouse and the burden of every ballad We were to drag up oceans of gold from the bottom of the sea we were to supply all Europe with herrings upon our own terms At present we hear no more of all this We have fished up very little gold that I can learn nor do we furnish the world with herrings as was expected Let us wait but a few years longer and we shall find all our expectations an herringfishery  ESSAY IX  WE essayists who are allowed but one subject at a time are by no means so fortunate as the writers of magazines who write upon several If a magaziner be dull upon the Spanish war he soon has us up again with the ghost in Cocklane if the reader begins to doze upon that he is quickly rouzed by an eastern tale tales prepare us for poetry and poetry for the meteorological history of the weather It is the life and soul of a magazine never to be long dull upon one subject and the reader like the sailor's horse has at least the comfortable refreshment of having the spur often changed  AS I see no reason why they should carry off all the rewards of genius I have some thoughts for the future of making this essay a magazine in miniature I shall hop from subject to subject and if properly encouraged I intend in time to adorn my feuille volant with pictures But to begin in the usual form with  A modest Address to the Publick  THE publick has been so often imposed upon by the unperforming promises of others that it is with the utmost modesty we assure them of our inviolable design of giving the very best collection that ever astonished society The publick we honour and regard and therefore to instruct and entertain them is our highest ambition with labours calculated as well to the head as the heart If four extraordinary pages of letterpress be any recommendation of our wit we may at least boast the honour of vindicating our own abilities To say more in favour of the INFERNAL MAGAZINE would be unworthy the Publick to say less would be injurious to ourselves As we have no interested motives for this undertaking being a society of gentlemen of distinction we disdain to eat or write like hirelings we are all gentlemen resolved to sell our sixpenny magazine merely for our own amusement  BE careful to ask for the Infernal Magazine  Dedication to that most ingenious of all Patrons the Tripoline Ambassador  May it please your Excellency  AS your taste in the fine arts is universally allowed and admired permit the authors of the Infernal Magazine to lay the following sheets humbly at your excellency's toe and should our labours ever have the happiness of one day adorning the courts of Fez we doubt not that the influence wherewith we are honoured shall be ever retained with the most warm ardour by  May it please your excellency  Your most devoted humble servants The Authors of the Infernal Magazine  A Speech spoken by the Indigent Philosopher to persuade his Club at Cateaton to declare War against Spain  MY honest friends and brother politicians I perceive that the intended war with Spain makes many of you uneasy Yesterday as we were told the stocks rose and you were glad to day they fall and you are again miserable  But my dear friends what is the rising or the falling of the stocks to us who have no money Let Nathan Ben Funk the Dutch Jew be glad or sorry for this but my good Mr Bellowsmender what is all this to you or me You must mend broken bellows and I write bad prose as long as we live whether we like a Spanish war or not Believe me my honest friends whatever you may talk of liberty and your own reason both that liberty and reason are conditionally resigned by every poor man in every society and as we are born to work so others are born to watch over us while we are working In the name of commonsense then my good friends let the great keep watch over us and let us mind our business and perhaps we may at last get money ourselves and set beggars at work in our turn I have a Latin sentence that is worth its weight in gold and which I shall beg leave to translate for your instruction An author called Lily's Grammar finely observes that  "Aes in praesenti perfectum format"  that is  "Readymoney makes a perfect man"  Let us then get readymoney and let them that will spend theirs by going to war with Spain  Rules for Behaviour drawn up by the Indigent Philosopher  IF you be a rich man you may enter the room with three loud hems march deliberately up to the chimney and turn your back to the fire If you be a poor man I would advise you to shrink into the room as fast as you can and place yourself as usual upon the corner of a chair in a remote corner  WHEN you are desired to sing in company I would advise you to refuse for it is a thousand to one but that you torment us with affectation or a bad voice  IF you be young and live with an old man I would advise you not to like gravy I was disinherited myself for liking gravy  DON'T laugh much in publick the spectators that are not as merry as you will hate you either because they envy your happiness or fancy themselves the subject of your mirth  Rules for raising the Devil Translated from the Latin of Danaeus de Sortiariis a Writer cotemporary with Calvin and one of the Reformers of our Church  THE person who desires to raise the Devil is to sacrifice a dog a cat and a hen all of his own property to Beelzebub He is to swear an eternal obedience and then to receive a mark in some unseen place either under the eyelid or in the roof of the mouth inflicted by the devil himself Upon this he has power given him over three spirits one for earth another for air and a third for the sea Upon certain times the devil holds an assembly of magicians in which each is to give an account of what evil he has done and what he wishes to do At this assembly he appears in the shape of an old man or often like a goat with large horns They upon this occasion renew their vows of obedience and then form a grand dance in honour of their false deity The devil instructs them in every method of injuring mankind in gathering poisons and of riding upon occasion through the air He shews them the whole method upon examination of giving evasive answers his spirits have power to assume the form of angels of light and there is  but one method of detecting them viz to ask them in proper form What method is the most certain to propagate the faith over all the world To this they are not permitted by the Superior Power to make a false reply nor are they willing to give the true one wherefore they continue silent and are thus detected  ESSAY X  THOUGH naturally pensive yet I am fond of gay company and take every opportunity of thus dismissing the mind from duty From this motive I am often found in the centre of a crowd and wherever pleasure is to be sold am always a purchaser In those places without being remarked by any I join in whatever goes forward work my passions into a similitude of frivolous earnestness shout as they shout and condemn as they happen to disapprove A mind thus funk for a while below its natural standard is qualified for stronger flights as those first retire who would spring forward with greater vigour  ATTRACTED by the serenity of the evening a friend and I lately went to gaze upon the company in one of the public walks near the city Here we sauntered together for some time either praising the beauty of such as were handsome or the dresses of such as had nothing else to recommend them We had gone thus deliberately forward for some time when my  friend stopping on a sudden caught me by the elbow and led me out of the public walk I could perceive by the quickness of his pace and by his frequently looking behind that he was attempting to avoid somebody who followed we now turned to the right then to the left as we went forward he still went faster but in vain the person whom he attempted to escape hunted us through every doubling and gained upon us each moment so that at last we fairly stood still resolving to face what we could not avoid  OUR pursuer soon came up and joined us with all the familiarity of an old acquaintance  "My dear Charles" cries he shaking my friend's hand "where have you been hiding this half a century Positively I had fancied you were gone down to cultivate matrimony and your estate in the country"  During the reply I had an opportunity of surveying the appearance of our new companion His hat was pinched up with peculiar smartness his looks were pale thin and sharp round his neck he wore a broad black ribbon and in his bosom a buckle studded with glass his coat was trimmed with tarnished twist he wore by his side a sword with a black hilt and his stockings  of silk though newly washed were grown yellow by long service I was so much engaged with the peculiarity of his dress that I attended only to the latter part of my friend's reply in which he complimented Mr Tibbs on the taste of his cloaths and the bloom in his countenance  "Psha psha Charles" cried the figure "no more of that if you love me you know I hate flattery on my soul I do and yet to be sure an intimacy with the great will improve one's appearance and a course of venison will fatten and yet faith I despise the great as much as you do but there are a great many damned honest fellows among them and we must not quarrel with one half because the other wants breeding If they were all such as my lord Mudler one of the most goodnatured creatures that ever squeezed a lemon I should myself be among the number of their admirers I was yesterday to dine at the dutchess of Piccadilly's My lord was there 'Ned' says he to me 'Ned' says he 'I'll hold gold to silver I can tell where you were poaching last night' Poaching my lord says I faith you have missed already for I staid at home and let the girls poach for me That's my way I take a fine woman as some animals  do their prey stand still and swoop they fall into my mouth"  "AH Tibbs thou art an happy fellow" cried my companion with looks of infinite pity  "I hope your fortune is as much improved as your understanding in such company"  "Improved" replied the other "you shall knowbut let it go no furthera great secretfive hundred a year to begin with My lord's word of honour for itHis lordship took me down in his own chariot yesterday and we had a teteatete dinner in the country where we talked of nothing else"  "I fancy you forgot sir" cried I "you told us but this moment of your dining yesterday in town"  "Did I say so" replied he cooly  "To be sure if I said so it was so Dined in town egad now I do remember I did dine in town but I dined in the country too for you must know my boys I eat two dinners By the bye I am grown as nice as the devil in my eating I'll tell you a pleasant affair about that we were a select party of us to dine at lady Grogram's an affected piece but let it go no farther a secret Well says I I'll hold a thousand guineas and say done first thatBut dear  Charles you are an honest creature lend me half a crown for a minute or two or so just tillBut hark'e ask me for it the next time we meet or it may be twenty to one but I forget to pay you"  WHEN he left us our conversation naturally turned upon so extraordinary a character  "His very dress cries my friend "is not less extraordinary than his conduct If you meet him this day you find him in rags if the next in embroidery With those persons of distinction of whom he talks so familiarly he has scarce a coffeehouse acquaintance However both for the interests of society and perhaps for his own Heaven has made him poor and while all the world perceives his wants he fancies them concealed from every eye An agreeable companion because he understands flattery and all must be pleased with the first part of his conversation tho' all are sure of its ending with a demand on their purse While his youth countenances the levity of his conduct he may thus earn a precarious subsistance but when age comes on the gravity of which is incompatible with buffoonery then will he find himself forsaken by all Condemned  in the decline of life to hang upon some rich family whom he once despised there to undergo all the ingenuity of studied contempt to be employed only as a spy upon the servants or a bugbear to fright children into duty"  ESSAY XI  THERE are some acquaintances whom it is no easy matter to shake off My little beau yesterday overtook me again in one of the public walks and slapping me on the shoulder saluted me with an air of the most perfect familiarity His dress was the same as usual except that he had more powder in his hair wore a dirtier shirt and had on a pair of temple spectacles and his hat under his arm  AS I knew him to be an harmless amusing little thing I could not return his smiles with any degree of severity so we walked forward on terms of the utmost intimacy and in a few minutes discussed all the usual topics preliminary to particular conversation  THE oddities that marked his character however soon began to appear he bowed to several welldressed persons who by their manner of returning the compliment appeared perfect strangers At intervals he drew out a pocketbook seeming to take memorandums  before all the company with much importance and assiduity In this manner he led me through the length of the whole Mall fretting at his absurdities and fancying myself laughed at as well as he by every spectator  WHEN we were got to the end of our procession  "Blast me" cries he with an air of vivacity "I never saw the Park so thin in my life before there's no company at all to day Not a single face to be seen"  "No company interrupted I peevishly "no company where there is such a crowd Why man there is too much What are the thousands that have been laughing at us but company"  "Lord my dear" returned he with the utmost good humour "you seem immensely chagrined but blast me when the world laughs at me I laugh at the world and so we are even My lord Trip Bill Squash the Creolian and I sometimes make a party at being ridiculous and so we say and do a thousand things for the joke sake But I see you are grave and if you are for a fine grave sentimental companion you shall dine with my wife to day I must insist on't I'll introduce you to Mrs Tibbs a lady of as elegant qualifications as any in  nature she was bred but that's between ourselves under the inspection of the countess of Shoreditch A charming body of voice But no more of that she shall give us a song You shall see my little girl too Carolina Wilhelma Amelia Tibbs a sweet pretty creature I design her for my lord Drumstick's eldest son but that's in friendship let it go no farther she's but six years old and yet she walks a minuet and plays on the guittar immensely already I intend she shall be as perfect as possible in every accomplishment In the first place I'll make her a scholar I'll teach her Greek myself and I intend to learn that language purposely to instruct her but let that be a secret"  THUS saying without waiting for a reply he took me by the arm and hauled me along We passed through many dark alleys and winding ways for from some motives to me unknown he seemed to have a particular aversion to every frequented street at last however we got to the door of a dismal looking house in the outlets of the town where he informed me he chose to reside for the benefit of the air  WE entered the lower door which seemed ever to lie most hospitably open and I began  to ascend an old and creaking staircase when as he mounted to shew me the way he demanded whether I delighted in prospects to which answering in the affirmative  "Then" says he "I shall shew you one of the most charming out of my windows we shall see the ships sailing and the whole country for twenty miles round tip top quite high My lord Swamp would give ten thousand guineas for such a one but as I sometimes pleasantly tell him I always love to keep my prospects at home that my friends may come to see me the oftener"  BY this time we were arrived as high as the stairs would permit us to ascend till we came to what he was facetiously pleased to call the first floor down the chimney and knocking at the door a voice with a Scotch accent from within demanded  "Wha's there"  My conductor answered that it was him But this not satisfying the querist the voice again repeated the demand to which he answered louder than before and now the door was opened by an old maid servant with cautious reluctance  WHEN we were got in he welcomed me to his house with great ceremony and turning to  the old woman asked where her lady was  "Good troth" replied she in the northern dialect "she's washing your twa shirts at the next door because they have taken an oath against lending out the tub any longer"  "My two shirts" cries he in a tone that faultered with confusion "what does the ideot mean"  "I ken what I mean well enough" replied the other "she's washing your twa shirts at the next door because"    "Fire and fury no more of thy stupid explanations" cried he"Go and inform her we have got company Were that Scotch hag" continued he turning to me "to be for ever in my family she would never learn politeness nor forget that absurd poisonous accent of her's or testify the smallest specimen of breeding or highlife and yet it is very surprizing too as I had her from a parliament man a friend of mine from the Highlands one of the politest men in the world but that's a secret"  WE waited some time for Mrs Tibbs's arrival during which interval I had a full opportunity of surveying the chamber and all its furniture which consisted of four chairs with old wrought bottoms that he assured me were his  wife's embroidery a square table that had been once japanned a cradle in one corner a lumbering cabinet in the other a broken shepherdess and a Mandarine without an head were stuck over the chimney and round the walls several paltry unframed pictures which he observed were all of his own drawing  "What do vou think Sir of that head in the corner done in the manner of Grisoni There's the true keeping in it its my own face and though there happens to be no likeness a countess offered me an hundred for its fellow I refused her for hang it that would be mechanical you know"  THE wise at last made her appearance at once a slattern and a coquet much emaciated but still carrying the remains of beauty She made twenty apologies for being seen in such an odious dishabille but hoped to be excused as she had staid out all night at Vauxhall Gardens with the countess who was excessively fond of the horns  "And indeed my dear" added she turning to her husband his lordship drank your health in a bumper"  "Poor Jack" cries he "a dear goodnatured creature I know he loves me but I hope my dear you have given orders for dinner you need  make no great preparations neither there are but three of us something elegant and little will do a turbot an ortolan or a"  "Or what do you think my dear interrupts the wife "of a nice pretty bit of oxcheek piping hot and dressed with a little of my own sauce"    "The very thing" replies he "it will eat best with some smart bottled beer but be sure to let's have the sauce his grace was so fond of I hate your immense loads of meat that is country all over extreme disgusting to those who are in the least acquainted with highlife"  BY this time my curiosity began to abate and my appetite to encrease the company of fools may at first make us smile but at last never fails of rendering us melancholy I therefore pretended to recollect a prior engagement and after having shewn my respect to the house by giving the old servant a piece of money at the door I took my leave Mr Tibbs assuring me that dinner if I staid would be ready at least in less than two hours  ESSAY XII  AS it has been observed that few are better qualified to give others advice than those who have taken the least of it themselves so in this respect I find myself perfectly authorized to offer mine and must take leave to throw together a few observations upon that part of a young man's conduct on his entering into life as it is called  THE most usual way among young men who have no resolution of their own is first to ask one friend's advice and follow it for some time then to ask advice of another and turn to that so of a third still unsteady always changing However every change of this nature is for the worse people may tell you of your being unfit for some peculiar occupations in life but heed them not whatever employment you follow with perseverance and assiduity will be found fit for you it will be your support in youth and comfort in age In learning the useful part of every profession very moderate abilities  will suffice great abilities are generally obnoxious to the possessors Life has been compared to a race but the allusion still improves by observing that the most swift are ever the most apt to stray from the course  TO know one profession only is enough for one man to know and this whatever the professors may tell you to the contrary is soon learned Be contented therefore with one good employment for if you understand two at a time people will give you business in neither  A CONJURER and a taylor once happened to converse together  "Alas" cries the taylor "what an unhappy poor creature am I If people ever take it into their heads to live without cloaths I am undone I have no other trade to have recourse to"  "Indeed friend I pity you sincerely replies the conjurer "but thank Heaven things are not quite so bad with me for if one trick should fail I have an hundred tricks more for them yet However if at any time you are reduced to beggary apply to me and I will relieve you"  A famine overspread the  land the taylor made a shift to live because his customers could not be without cloaths but the poor conjurer with all his hundred tricks could find none that had money to throw away is was in vain that he promised to eat fire or to vomit pins no single creature would relieve him till he was at last obliged to beg from the very taylor whose calling he had formerly despised  THERE are no obstructions more fatal to fortune than pride and resentment If you must resent injuries at all at least suppress your indignation till you become rich and then shew away The resentment of a poor man is like the efforts of a harmless insect to sting it may get him crushed but cannot defend him Who values that anger which is consumed only in empty menaces  ONCE upon a time a goose fed its young by a pond side and a goose in such circumstances is always extremely proud and excessively punctilious If any other animal without the least design to offend happened to pass that way the goose was immediately at it The pond she said was hers and she would maintain  her right in it and support her honour while she had a bill to hiss or a wing to flutter In this manner she drove away ducks pigs and chickens nay even the insidious cat was seen to scamper A lounging mastiff however happened to pass by and thought it no harm if he should lap a little of the water as he was thirsty The guardian goose flew at him like a fury pecked at him with her beak and slapped him with her feathers The dog grew angry and had twenty times a mind to give her a sly snap but suppressing his indignation because his master was nigh  "A pox take thee" cries he "for a fool sure those who have neither strength nor weapons to fight at least should be civil"  So saying he went forward to the pond quenched his thirst in spite of the goose and followed his master  ANOTHER obstruction to the fortune of youth is that while they are willing to take offence from none they are also equally desirous of giving nobody offence From hence they endeavour to please all comply with every request and attempt to suit themselves to every company have no will of their own but  like wax catch every contiguous impression By thus attempting to give universal satisfaction they at last find themselves miserably disappointed to bring the generality of admirers on our side it is sufficient to attempt pleasing a very few  A PAINTER of eminence was once resolved to finish a piece which should please the whole world When therefore he had drawn a picture in which his utmost skill was exhausted it was exposed in the public marketplace with directions at the bottom for every spectator to mark with a brush that lay by every limb and feature which seemed erroneous The spectators came and in general applauded but each willing to shew his talent at criticism stigmatized whatever he thought proper At evening when the painter came he was mortified to find the picture one universal blot not a single stroke that had not the marks of disapprobation Not satisfied with this trial▪ the next day he was resolved to try them in a different manner and exposing his picture as before desired that every spectator would mark those beauties he approved or admired The people complied and the artist returning found  his picture covered with the marks of beauty every stroke that had been yesterday condemned now received the character of approbation  "Well" cries the painter "I now find that the best way to please all the world is to attempt pleasing one half of it"  ESSAY XIII  INDULGENT nature seems to have exempted this island from many of those epidemic evils which are so fatal in other parts of the world A want of rain for a few days beyond the expected season in some parts of the globe spreads famine desolation and terror over the whole country but in this fortunate land of Britain the inhabitant courts health in every breeze and the husbandman ever sows in joyful expectation  BUT though the nation be exempt from real evils it is not more happy on this account than others The people are afflicted it is true with neither famine nor pestilence but then there is a disorder peculiar to the country which every season makes strange ravages among them it spreads with pestilential rapidity and infects almost every rank of people what is still more strange the natives have no name for this peculiar malady though well known to foreign physicians by the appellation of Epidemic Terror  A SEASON is never known to pass in which the people are not visited by this cruel calamity in one shape or another seemingly different though ever the same one year it issues from a baker's shop in the shape of a sixpenny loaf the next it takes the appearance of a comet with a fiery tail the third it threatens like a flatbottomed boat and the fourth it carries consternation in the bite of a mad dog The people when once infected lose their relish for happiness saunter about with looks of despondence ask after the calamities of the day and receive no comfort but in heightening each other's distress It is insignificant how remote or near how weak or powerful the object of terror may be when once they resolve to fright and be frighted the merest trifles sow consternation and dismay each proportions his fears not to the object but to the dread he discovers in the countenance of others for when once the fermentation is begun it goes on of itself though the original cause be discontinued which first set it in motion  A DREAD of mad dogs is the epidemic terror which now prevails and the whole nation is at present actually groaning under the malignity of its influence The people sally from  their houses with that circumspection which is prudent in such as expect a mad dog at every turning The physician publishes his prescription the beadle prepares his halter and a few of unusual bravery arm themselves with boots and buff gloves in order to face the enemy if he should offer to attack them In short the whole people stand bravely upon their defence and seem by their present spirit to shew a resolution of being tamely bit by mad dogs no longer  THEIR manner of knowing whether a dog be mad or no somewhat resembles the antient Gothic custom of trying witches The old woman suspected was tied hand and foot and thrown into the water If the swam then she was instantly carried off to be burnt for a witch if she sunk then indeed she was acquitted of the charge but drowned in the experiment In the same manner a crowd gather round a dog suspected of madness and they begin by teizing the devoted animal on every side If he attempts to stand upon the defensive and bite then is he unanimously found guilty for  "A mad dog always snaps at every thing"  If on the contrary he strives to escape by running away then he can expect no compassion  "for  mad dogs always run straight forward before them"  IT is pleasant enough for a neutral being like me who have no share in those ideal calamities to mark the stages of this national disease The terror at first feebly enters with a disregarded story of a little dog that had gone through a neighbouring village which was thought to be mad by several who had seen him The next account comes that a mastiff ran through a certain town and had bit five geese which immediately ran mad foamed at the bill and died in great agonies soon after Then comes an affecting history of a little boy bit in the leg and gone down to be dipped in the salt water When the people have sufficiently shuddered at that they are next congealed with a frightful account of a man who was said lately to have died from a bite he had received some years before This relation only prepares the way for another still more hideous as how the master of a family with seven small children were all bit by a mad lapdog and how the poor father first perceived the infection by calling for a draught of water where he saw the lapdog swimming in the cup  WHEN epidemic terror is thus once excited every morning comes loaded with some new disaster as in stories of ghosts each loves to hear the account though it only serves to make him uneasy so here each listens with eagerness and adds to the tidings with new circumstances of peculiar horror A lady for instance in the country of very weak nerves has been frighted by the barking of a dog and this alas too frequently happens The story soon is improved and spreads that a mad dog had frighted a lady of distinction These circumstances begin to grow terrible before they have reached the neighbouring village and there the report is that a lady of quality was bit by a mad mastiff This account every moment gathers new strength and grows more dismal as it approaches the capital and by the time it has arrived in town the lady is described with wild eyes foaming mouth running mad upon all four barking like a dog biting her servants and at last smothered between two beds by the advice of her doctors while the mad mastiff is in the mean time ranging the whole country over slavering at the mouth and seeking whom he may devour  MY landlady a goodnatured woman but a little credulous waked me some mornings ago before the usual hour with horror and astonishment in her looks She desired me if I had any regard for my safety to keep within for a few days ago so dismal an accident had happened as to put all the world upon their guard A mad dog down in the country she assured me had bit a farmer who soon becoming mad ran into his own yard and bit a fine brindled cow the cow quickly became as mad as the man began to foam at the mouth and raising herself up walked about on her hind legs sometimes barking like a dog and sometimes attempting to talk like the farmer Upon examining the grounds of this story I found my landlady had it from one neighbour who had it from another neighbour who heard it from very good authority  WERE most stories of this nature well examined it would be found that numbers of such as have been said to suffer were no way injured and that of those who have been actually bitten not one in a hundred was bit by a mad dog Such accounts in general therefore only serve to make the people miserable  by false terrors and sometimes fright the patient into actual phrenzy by creating those very symptoms they pretended to deplore  BUT even allowing three or four to die in a season of this terrible death and four is probably too large a concession yet still it is not considered how many are preserved in their health and in their property by this devoted animal's services The midnight robber is kept at a distance the insidious thief is often detected the healthful chace repairs many a worn constitution and the poor man finds in his dog a willing assistant eager to lessen his toil and content with the smallest retribution  "A DOG says one of the English poets" is an honest creature and I am a friend to dogs"  Of all the beasts that graze the lawn or hunt the forest a dog is the only animal that leaving his fellows attempts to cultivate the friendship of man to man he looks in all his necessities with a speaking eye for assistance exerts for him all the little service in his power with chearfulness and pleasure for him bears famine and fatigue with patience and resignation no injuries can abate his fidelity no distress induce him to forsake his benefactor  studious to please and fearing to offend he is still an humble stedfast dependant and in him alone fawning is not flattery How unkind then to torture this faithful creature who has left the forest to claim the protection of man How ungrateful a return to the trusty animal for all its services  ESSAY XIV  AGE that lessens the enjoyment of life encreases our desire of living Those dangers which in the vigour of youth we had learned to despise assume new terrors as we grow old Our caution encreasing as our years encrease fear becomes at last the prevailing passion of the mind and the small remainder of life is taken up in useless efforts to keep off our end or provide for a continued existence  STRANGE contradiction in our nature and to which even the wise are liable If I should judge of that part of life which lies before me by that which I have already seen the prospect is hideous Experience tells me that my past enjoyments have brought no real felicity and sensation assures me that those I have felt are stronger than those which are yet to come Yet experience and sensation in vain persuade hope more powerful than either dresses out the distant prospect in fancied beauty some happiness in long perspective still beckons me  to pursue and like a losing gamester every new disappointment encreases my ardour to continue the game  WHENCE then is this encreased love of life which grows upon us with our years whence comes it that we thus make greater efforts to preserve our existence at a period when it becomes scarce worth the keeping Is it that nature attentive to the preservation of mankind encreases our wishes to live while she lessens our enjoyments and as she robs the senses of every pleasure equips imagination in the spoil Life would be insupportable to an old man who loaded with infirmities feared death no more than when in the vigour of manhood the numberless calamities of decaying nature and the consciousness of surviving every pleasure would at once induce him with his own hand to terminate the scene of misery but happily the contempt of death forsakes him at a time when it could only be prejudicial and life acquires an imaginary value in proportion as its real value is no more  OUR attachment to every object around us encreases in general from the length of our acquaintance with it "I would not chuse"  says a French philosopher  "to see an old post pulled up with which I had been long acquainted"  A mind long habituated to a certain set of objects insensibly becomes fond of seeing them visits them from habit and parts from them with reluctance from hence proceeds the avarice of the old in every kind of possession they love the world and all that it produces they love life and all its advantages not because it gives them pleasure but because they have known it long  CHINVANG the Chaste ascending the throne of China commanded that all who were unjustly detained in prison during the preceding reigns should be set free Among the number who came to thank their deliverer on this occasion there appeared a majestic old man who falling at the emperor's feet addressed him as follows  "Great father of China behold a wretch now eightyfive years old who was shut up in a dungeon at the age of twentytwo I was imprisoned tho' a stranger to crime or without being even confronted by my accusers I have now lived in solitude and darkness for more than fifty years and am grown familiar with distress As yet dazzled with the splendour  of that sun to which you have restored me I have been wandering the streets to find out some friend that would assist or relieve or remember me but my friends my family and relations are all dead and I am forgotten Permit me then O Chinvang to wear out the wretched remains of life in my former prison the walls of my dungeon are to me more pleasing than the most splendid palace I have not long to live and shall be unhappy except I spend the rest of my days where my youth was passed in that prison from whence you were pleased to release me"  THE old man's passion for confinement is similar to that we all have for life We are habituated to the prison we look round with discontent are displeased with the abode and yet the length of our captivity only encreases our fondness for the cell The trees we have planted the houses we have built or the posterity we have begotten all serve to bind us closer to earth and embitter our parting Life sues the young like a new acquaintance the companion as yet unexhausted is at once instructive and amusing it's company pleases yet for all this it is but little regarded To  us who are declined in years life appears like an old friend its jests have been anticipated in former conversation it has no new story to make us smile no new improvement with which to surprize yet still we love it destitute of every enjoyment still we love it husband the wasting treasure with encreasing frugality and feel all the poignancy of anguish in the fatal separation  SIR PHILIP MORDAUNT was young beautiful sincere brave an Englishman He had a complete fortune of his own and the love of the king his master which was equivalent to riches Life opened all her treasures before him and promised a long succession of future happiness He came tasted of the entertainment but was disgusted even at the beginning He professed an aversion to living was tired of walking round the same circle had tried every enjoyment and found them all grow weaker at every repetition  "If life be in youth to displeasing" cried he to himself "what will it appear when age comes on if it be at present indifferent sure it will then be execrable"  This thought embittered every reflection till at last with all the serenity of perverted reason he ended the  debate with a pistol Had this selfdeluded man been apprized that existence grows more desirable to us the longer we exist he would have then faced old age without shrinking he would have boldly dared to live and served that society by his future assiduity which he basely injured by his desertion  ESSAY XV  FOREIGNERS observe that there are no ladies in the world more beautiful or more ill dressed than those of England Our countrywomen have been compared to those pictures where the face is the work of a Raphael but the draperies thrown out by some empty pretender destitute of taste and entirely unacquainted with design  IF I were a poet I might observe on this occasion that so much beauty set off with all the advantages of dress would be too powerful an antagonist for the opposite sex and therefore it was wisely ordered that our ladies should want taste lest their admirers should entirely want reason  BUT to confess a truth I do not find they have a greater aversion to fine cloaths than the women of any other country whatsoever I can't fancy that a shopkeeper's wife in Cheapside has a greater tenderness for the fortune of her husband than a citizen's wife in Paris or  that miss in a boardingschool is more an oeconomist in dress than mademoiselle in a nunnery  ALTHOUGH Paris may be accounted the soil in which almost every fashion takes its rise its influence is never so general there as with us They study there the happy method of uniting grace and fashion and never excuse a woman for being aukwardly dressed by saying her cloaths are in the mode A French woman is a perfect architect in dress she never with Gothic ignorance mixes the orders she never tricks out a squabby Doric shape with Corinthian finery or to speak without metaphor she conforms to general fashion only when it happens not to be repugnant to private beauty  THE English ladies on the contrary seem to have no other standard of grace but the run of the town If fashion gives the word every distinction of beauty complexion or statute ceases Sweeping trains Prussian bonnets and trollopees as like each other as if cut from the same piece level all to one standard The Mall the gardens and playhouses are filled with ladies in uniform and their whole appearance shews as little variety or taste as if  their cloaths were bespoke by the colonel of a marching regiment or fancied by the artist who dresses the three battalions of guards  BUT not only the ladies of every shape and complexion but of every age too are possessed of this unaccountable passion for levelling all distinction in dress The lady of no quality travels fast behind the lady of some quality and a woman of sixty is as gaudy as her granddaughter A friend of mine a goodnatured old man amused me the other day with an account of his journey to the Mall It seems in his walk thither he for some time followed a lady who as he thought by her dress was a girl of fifteen It was airy elegant and youthful My old friend had called up all his poetry on this occasion and fancied twenty cupids prepared for execution in every folding of her white negligee He had prepared his imagination for an angel's face but what was his mortification to find that the imaginary goddess was no other than his cousin Hannah some years older than himself  BUT to give it in his own words  "After the transports of our first salute" said he  "were over I could not avoid running my eye over her whole appearance Her gown was of cambrick cut short before in order to discover an highheeled shoe which was buckled almost at the toe Her cap consisted of a few bits of cambrick and flowers of painted paper stuck on one side of her head Her bosom that had felt no hand but the hand of time these twenty years rose suing to be pressed I could indeed have wished her more than an handkerchief of Paris net to shade her beauties for as Tasso says of the rosebud 'Quanto si nostra men tanto epiu bella' A female breast is generally thought most beautiful as it is more sparingly discovered"  "AS my cousin had not put on all this finery for nothing she was at that time sallying out to the Park when I had overtaken her Perceiving however that I had on my best wig she offered if I would 'squire her there to send home the footman Though I trembled for our reception in public yet I could not with any civility refuse so to be as gallant as possible I took her hand in my arm and thus we marched on together"  WHEN we made our entry at the Park two antiquated figures so polite and so tender soon attracted the eyes of the company As we made our way among crowds who were out to shew their finery as well as we wherever we came I perceived we brought goodhumour with us The polite could not forbear smiling and the vulgar burst out into a horselaugh at our grotesque figures Cousin Hannah who was perfectly conscious of the rectitude of her own appearance attributed all this mirth to the oddity of mine while I as cordially placed the whole to her account Thus from being two of the bestnatured creatures alive before we got half way up the Mall we both began to grow peevish and like two mice on a string endeavoured to revenge the impertinence of others upon ourselves  "I am amazed cousin Jeffery" says miss "that I can never get you to dress like a Christian I knew we should have the eyes of the Park upon us with your great wig so frizzled and yet so beggarly and your monstrous muff I hate those odious muffs"  I could have patiently borne a criticism on all the rest of my equipage but as I had always a peculiar veneration for my muff I could not forbear being piqued a little and throwing my eyes with a spiteful air  on her bosom  "I could heartily wish madam" replied I "that for your sake my muff was cut into a tippet"  AS my cousin by this time was grown heartily ashamed of her gentlemanusher and as I was never very fond of any kind of exhibition myself it was mutually agreed to retire for a while to one of the seats and from that retreat remark on others as freely as they had remarked on us  WHEN seated we continued silent for some time employed in very different speculations I regarded the whole company now passing in review before me as drawn out merely for my amusement For my entertainment the beauty had all that morning been improving her charms the beau had put on lace and the young doctor a big wig merely to please me But quite different were the sentiments or cousin Hannah she regarded every welldressed woman as a victorious rival hated every face that seemed dressed in goodhumour or wore the appearance of greater happiness than her own I perceived her uneasiness and attempted to lessen it by observing that there was no company in the Park to day To this she readily  assented  "and yet" says she "it is full enough of scrubs of one kind or another"  My smiling at this observation gave her spirits to pursue the bent of her inclination and now she began to exhibit her skill in secret history as she found me disposed to listen  "Observe" says she to me "that old woman in tawdry silk and dressed out beyond the fashion That is Miss Biddy Evergreen Miss Biddy it seems has money and as she considers that money was never so scarce as it is now she seems resolved to keep what she has to herself She is ugly enough you see yet I assure you she has refused several offers to my own knowledge within this twelvemonth Let me see three gentlemen from Ireland who study the law two waiting captains her doctor and and a Scotch preacher who had like to have carried her off All her time is passed between sickness and finery Thus she spends the whole week in a close chamber with no other company but her monkey her apothecary and cat and comes dressed out to the Park every Sunday to shew her airs to get new lovers to catch a new cold and to make new work for the doctor"  "THERE goes Mrs Roundabout I mean the fat lady in the lutestring trollopee Between you and I she is but a cutler's wife See how she's dressed as fine as hands and pins can make her while her two marriageable daughters like bunters in stuff gowns are now taking sixpennyworth of tea at the Whiteconduithouse Odious Fuss how she waddles along with her train two yards behind her She puts me in mind of my lord Bantam's Indian sheep which are obliged to have their monstrous tails trundled along in a gocart For all her airs it goes to her husband's heart to see four yards of good lutestring wearing against the ground like one of his knives on a grindstone To speak my mind cousin Jeffery I never liked those tails for suppose a young fellow should be rude and the lady should offer to step back in the fright instead of retiring she treads upon her train and falls fairly on her back and then you know cousin her cloaths may be spoiled  "AH Miss Mazzard I knew we should not miss her in the Park she in the monstrous Prussian bonnet Miss though so very fine was bred a milliner and might  have had some custom if she had minded her business but the girl was fond of finery and instead of dressing her customers laid out all her goods in adorning herself Every new gown she put on impaired her credit she still however went on improving her appearance and lessening her little fortune and is now you see become a belle and a bankrupt"  MY cousin was proceeding in her remarks which were interrupted by the approach of the very lady she had been so freely describing Miss had perceived her at a distance and approached to salute her I found by the warmth of the two ladies protestations that they had been long intimate esteemed friends and acquaintance Both were so pleased at this happy rencounter that they were resolved not to part for the day So we all crossed the Park together and I saw them into a hackneycoach at St James's  ESSAY XVI  WHERE Tauris lifts its head above the storm and presents nothing to the sight of the distant traveller but a prospect of nodding rocks falling torrents and all the variety of tremendous nature on the bleak bosom of this frightful mountain secluded from society and detesting the ways of men lived Asem the Manhater  ASEM had spent his youth with men had s  ared in their amusements and had been taught to love his fellowcreatures with the most ardent affection but from the tenderness of his disposition he exhausted all his fortune in relieving the wants of the distressed The petitioner never sued in vain the weary traveller never passed his door he only desisted from doing good when he had no longer the power of relieving  FROM a fortune thus spent in benevolence he expected a grateful return from those he had  formerly relieved and made his application with confidence of redress the ungrateful world soon grew weary of his importunity for pity is but a shortlived passion He soon therefore began to view mankind in a very different light from that in which he had before behold them he perceived a thousand vices he had never before suspected to exist whereever he turned ingratitude dissimulation and treachery contributed to increase his detestation of them Resolved therefore to continue no longer in a world which he hated and which repaid his detestation with contempt he retired to this region of sterility in order to brood over his resentment in solitude and converse with the only honest heart he knew namely with his own  A CAVE was his only shelter from the inclemency of the weather fruits gathered with difficulty from the mountain's side his only food and his drink was fetched with danger and toil from the headlong torrent In this manner he lived sequestered from society passing the hours in meditation and sometimes exulting that he was able to live independently of his fellowcreatures  AT the foot of the mountain an extensive lake displayed its glassy bosom reflecting on its broad surface the impending horrors of the mountain To this capacious mirror he would sometimes descend and reclining on its steep banks cast an eager look on the smooth expanse that lay before him  "How beautiful" he often cried "is nature" how lovely even "in her wildest scenes How finely contrasted is the level plain that lies beneath me with yon awful pile that hides its tremendous head in clouds But the beauty of these scenes is no way comparable with their utility from hence an hundred rivers are supplied which distribute health and verdure to the various countries through which they flow Every part of the universe is beautiful just and wise but man vile man is a solecism in nature the only monster in the creation Tempests and whirlwinds have their use but vicious ungrateful man is a blot in the fair page of universal beauty Why was I born of that detested species whose vices are almost a reproach to the wisdom of the divine Creator Were men entirely free from vice all would be uniformity harmony and order A world of moral rectitude should be  the result of a perfectly moral agent Why why then O Alla must I be thus confined in darkness doubt and despair"  JUST as he uttered the word Despair he was going to plunge into the lake beneath him at once to satisfy his doubts and put a period to his anxiety when he perceived a most majestic being walking on the surface of the water and approaching the bank on which he stood So unexpected an object at once checked his purpose he stopped contemplated and fancied he saw something awful and divine in his aspect  "Son of Adam" cried the genius "stop thy rash purpose the father of the faithful has seen thy justice thy integrity thy miseries and hath sent me to afford and administer relief Give me thine hand and follow without trembling wherever I shall lead in me behold the genius of conviction kept by the great prophet to turn from their errors those who go astray not from curiosity but a rectitude of intention Follow me and be wise"  ASEM immediately descended upon the lake and his guide conducted him along the surface of the water till coming near the centre of the lake they both began to sink the waters closed over their heads they descended several hundred fathoms till Asem just ready to give up his life as inevitably lost found himself with his celestial guide in another world at the bottom of the waters where human foot had never trod before His astonishment was beyond description when he saw a sun like that he had left a serene sky over his head and blooming verdure under his feet  "I PLAINLY perceive your amazement" said the genius "but suspend it for a while This world was formed by Alla at the request and under the inspection of our great prophet who once entertained the same doubts which filled your mind when I found you and from the consequence of which you were so lately rescued The rational inhabitants of this world are formed agreeable to your own ideas they are absolutely without vice In other respects it resembles your earth but differs from it in being wholy inhabited by men who never do wrong If  you find this world more agreeable than that you so lately left you have free permission to spend the remainder of your days in it but permit me for some time to attend you that I may silence your doubts and make you better acquainted with your company and your new habitation"  "A WORLD without vice Rational beings without immorality" cried Asem in a rapture "I thank thee O Alla who hast at length heard my petitions this this indeed will produce happiness extasy and ease O for an immortality to spend it among men who are incapable of ingratitude injustice fraud violence and a thousand other crimes that render society miserable"  "CEASE thine acclamations" replied the genius "Look around thee reflect on every object and action before us and communicate to me the result of thine observations Lead wherever you think proper I shall be your attendant and instructor"  Asem and his companion travelled on in silence for some time the former being entirely lost in astonishment but at last recovering his former serenity  he could not help observing that the face of the country bore a near resemblance to that he had left except that this subterranean world still seemed to retain its primaeval wildness  "HERE" cried Asem "I perceive animals of prey and others that seem only designed for their subsistence it is the very same in the world over our heads But had I been permitted to instruct our prophet I would have removed this defect and formed no voracious or destructive animals which only prey on the other parts of the creation"  "Your tenderness for inferior animals is I find remarkable" said the genius smiling "But with regard to meaner creatures this world exactly resembles the other and indeed for obvious reasons for the earth can support a more considerable number of animals by their thus becoming food for each other than if they had lived entirely on her vegetable productions So that animals of different natures thus formed instead of lessening their multitude subsist in the greatest number possible But let us hasten on to the inhabited country before us and see what that offers for instruction"  THEY soon gained the utmost verge of the forest and entered the country inhabited by men without vice and Asem anticipated in idea the rational delight he hoped to experience in such an innocent society But they had scarce left the confines of the wood when they beheld one of the inhabitants flying with hasty steps and terror in his countenance from an army of squirrels that closely pursued him  "Heavens" cried Asem "why does he fly What can he fear from animals so contemptible"  He had scarce spoken when he perceived two dogs pursuing another of the human species who with equal terror and haste attempted to avoid them  "This" cried Asem to his guide "is truly surprising nor can I conceive the reason for so strange an action"  "Every species of animals" replied the genius "has of late grown very powerful in this country for the inhabitants at first thinking it unjust to use either fraud or force in destroying them they have insensibly increased and now frequently ravage their harmless frontiers"  "But they should have been destroyed" cried Asem "you see the consequence of such neglect" "Where is then that tenderness you so lately expressed for subordinate animals" replied  the genius smiling "you seem to have forgot that branch of justice  "I must acknowledge my mistake" returned Asem I am now convinced that we must be guilty of tyranny and injustice to the brute creation if we would enjoy the world ourselves But let us no longer observe the duty of man to these irrational creatures but survey their connections with one another"  AS they walked farther up the country the more he was surprized to see no vestiges of handsome houses no cities nor any mark of elegant design His conductor perceiving his surprize observed That the inhabitants of this new world were perfectly content with their antient simplicity each had an house which though homely was sufficient to lodge his little family they were too good to build houses which could only encrease their own pride and the envy of the spectator what they built was for convenience and not for shew  "At least then" said Asem "they have neither architects painters or statuaries in their society but these are idle arts and may be spared However before I spend much more time here you should have my thanks for introducing me into the society of some  of their wisest men there is scarce any pleasure to me equal to a refined conversation there is nothing of which I am so enamoured as wisdom"  "Wisdom" replied his instructor "how ridiculous We have no wisdom here for we have no occasion for it true wisdom is only a knowledge of our own duty and the duty of others to us but of what use is such wisdom here each intuitively performs what is right in himself and expects the same from others If by wisdom you should mean vain curiosity and empty speculation as such pleasures have their origin in vanity luxury or avarice we are too good to pursue them"  "All this may be right" says Asem "but methinks I observe a solitary disposition prevail among the people each family keeps separately within their own precincts without society or without intercourse"  "That indeed is true" replied the other "here is no established society nor should there be any all societies are made either through fear or friendship the people we are among are too good to fear each other and there are no motives to private friendship where all are equally meritorious"  "Well then" said the sceptic "as I am to spend my time here  if I am to have neither the polite arts nor wisdom nor friendship in such a world I should be glad at least of an easy companion who may tell me his thoughts and to whom I may communicate mine"  "And to what purpose should either do this" says the genius "flattery or curiosity are vicious motives and never allowed of here and wisdom is out of the question"  "STILL however" said Asem "the inhabitants must be happy each is contented with his own possessions nor avariciously endeavours to heap up more than is necessary for his own subsistence each has therefore leisure for pitying those that stand in need of his compassion"  He had scarce spoken when his ears were assaulted with the lamentations of a wretch who sat by the wayside and in the most deplorable distress seemed gently to murmur at his own misery Asem immediately ran to his relief and found him in the last stage of a consumption  "Strange" cried the son of Adam "that men who are free from vice should thus suffer so much misery without relief"  "Be not surprized" said the wretch who was dying "would it not be the utmost injustice for beings who have only just sufficient to support  themselves and are content with a bare subsistence to take it from their own mouths to put it into mine They never are possessed of a single meal more than is necessary and what is barely necessary cannot be dispensed with"  "They should have been supplied with more than is necessary" cried Asem "and yet I contradict my own opinion but a moment before all is doubt perplexity and confusion Even the want of ingratitude is no virtue here since they never received a favour They have however another excellence yet behind the love of their country is still I hope one of their darling virtues"  "Peace Asem" replied the guardian with a countenance not less severe than beautiful "nor forfeit all thy pretensions to wisdom the same selfish motives by which we prefer our own interest to that of others induce us to regard our country preferably to that of another Nothing less than universal benevolence is free from vice and that you see is practised here"  "Strange" cries the disappointed pilgrim in an agony of distress "what sort of a world am I now introduced to There is scarce a single virtue but that of temperance which they practise and in that they are no  way superior to the very brute creation There is scarce an amusement which they enjoy fortitude liberality friendship wisdom conversation and love of country all are virtues entirely unknown here thus it seems that to be unacquainted with vice is not to know virtue Take me O my genius back to that very world which I have despised a world which has Alla for its contriver is much more wisely formed than that which has been projected by Mahomet Ingratitude contempt and hatred I can now suffer for perhaps I have deserved them When I arraigned the wisdom of Providence I only shewed my own ignorance henceforth let me keep from vice myself and pity it in others"  HE had scarce ended when the genius assuming an air of terrible complacency called all his thunders around him and vanished in a whirlwind Asem astonished at the terror of the scene looked for his imaginary world when casting his eyes around he perceived himself in the very situation and in the very place where he first began to repine and despair his right foot had been just advanced to take the fatal plunge nor had it been yet withdrawn  so instantly did Providence strike the series of truths just imprinted on his soul He now departed from the waterside in tranquility and leaving his horrid mansion travelled to Segestan his native city where he diligently applied himself to commerce and put in practice that wisdom he had learned in solitude The frugality of a few years soon produced opulence the number of his domestics increased his friends came to him from every part of the city nor did he receive them with disdain▪ and a youth of misery was concluded with an old age of elegance affluence and ease  ESSAY XVII  IT is allowed on all hands that our English divines receive a more liberal education and improve that education by frequent study more than any others of this reverend profession in Europe In general also it may be observed that a greater degree of gentility is affixed to the character of a student in England than elsewhere by which means our clergy have an opportunity of seeing better company while young and of sooner wearing off those prejudices which they are apt to imbibe even in the best regulated universities and which may be justly termed the vulgar errors of the wise  YET with all these advantages it is very obvious that the clergy are no where so little thought of by the populace as here and though our divines are foremost with respect to abilities yet they are found last in the effects of their ministry the vulgar in general appearing no way impressed with a sense of religious duty I am not for whining at  the depravity of the times or for endeavouring to paint a prospect more gloomy than in nature but certain it is no person who has travelled will contradict me when I aver that the lower orders of mankind in other countries testify on every occasion the profoundest awe of religion while in England they are scarcely awakened into a sense of its duties even in circumstances of the greatest distress  THIS dissolute and fearless conduct foreigners are apt to attribute to climate and constitution may not the vulgar being pretty much neglected in our exhortations from the pulpit be a conspiring cause Our divines seldom stoop to their mean capacities and they who want instruction most find least in our religious assemblies  WHATEVER may become of the higher orders of mankind who are generally possessed of collateral motives to virtue the vulgar should be particularly regarded whose behaviour in civil life is totally hinged upon their hopes and fears Those who constitute the basis of the great fabrick of society should be particularly regarded for in policy as in architecture ruin is most fatal when it begins from the bottom  MEN of real sense and understanding prefer a prudent mediocrity to a precarious popularity and fearing to outdo their duty leave it half done Their discourses from the pulpit are generally dry methodical and unaffecting delivered with the most insipid calmness insomuch that should the peaceful preacher lift his head over the cushion which alone he seems to address he might discover his audience instead of being awakened to remorse actually sleeping over his methodical and laboured composition  THIS method of preaching is however by some called an address to reason and not to to the passions this is stiled the making of converts from conviction but such are indifferently acquainted with human nature who are not sensible that men seldom reason about their debaucheries till they are committed reason is but a weak antagonist when headlong passion dictates in all such cases we should arm one passion against another it is with the human mind as in nature from the mixture of two opposites the result is most frequently neutral tranquility Those who attempt to reason us out of our follies begin at the wrong end since the attempt naturally presupposes  us capable of reason but to be made capable of this is one great point of the cure  THERE are but few talents requisite to become a popular preacher for the people are easily pleased if they perceive any endeavours in the orator to please them the meanest qualifications will work this effect if the preacher sincerely sets about it Perhaps little indeed very little more is required than sincerity and assurance and a becoming sincerity is always certain of producing a becoming assurance  "Si vis me fiere dolendum est primum tibi ipsi"  is so trite a quotation that it almost demands an apology to repeat it yet though all allow the justice of the remark how few do we find put it in practice our orators with the most faulty bashfulness seem impressed rather with an awe of their audience than with a just respect for the truths they are about to deliver they of all professions seem the most bashful who have the greatest right to glory in their commission  THE French preachers generally assume all that dignity which becomes men who are ambassadors from Christ the English divines like erroneous envoys seem more sollicitous not to  offend the court to which they are sent than to drive home the interests of their employer The bishop of Massillon in the first sermon he ever preached found the whole audience upon his getting into the pulpit in a disposition no way favourable to his intentions their nods whispers or drowsy behaviour shewed him that there was no great profit to be expected from his sowing in a soil to improper however he soon changed the disposition of his audience by his manner of beginning  "If" says he "a cause the most important that could be conceived were to be tried at the bar before qualified judges if this cause interested ourselves in particular if the eyes of the whole kingdom were fixed upon the event if the most eminent council were employed on both sides and if we had heard from our infancy of this yet undetermined trial would you not all sit with due attention and warm expectation to the pleadings on each side Would not all your hopes and fears be hinged upon the final decision And yet let me tell you you have this moment a cause of much greater importance before you a cause where not one nation but all the world ar  tried not before a fallible tribu  aweful throne of Heaven where not your temporal and transitory interests are the subject of debate but your eternal happiness or misery where the cause is still undetermined but perhaps the very moment I am speaking may fix the irrevocable decree that shall last for ever and yet notwithstanding all this you can hardly sit with patience to hear the tidings of your own salvation I plead the cause of Heaven and yet I am scarcely attended to c"  THE stile the abruptness of a beginning like this in the closet would appear absurd but in the pulpit it is attended with the most lasting impressions that stile which in the closet might justly be called flimsy seems the true mode of eloquence here I never read a fine composition under the title of a sermon that I do not think the author has miscalled his piece for the talents to be used in writing well intirely differ from those of speaking well The qualifications for speaking as has been already observed are easily acquired they are accomplishments which may be taken up by every candidate who will be at the pains of stooping Impressed with a sense of the truths he is about to deliver a preacher disregards the applause or  the contempt of his audience and he insensibly assumes a just and manly sincerity With this talent alone we see what crowds are drawn around enthusiasts even destitute of commonsense what numbers converted to Christianity Folly may sometimes set an example for wisdom to practise and our regular divines may borrow instruction from even methodists who go their circuits and preach prizes among the populace Even Whitfield may be placed as a model to some of our young divines let them join to their own good sense his earnest manner of delivery  IT will be perhaps objected that by confining the excellencies of a preacher to proper assurance earnestness and openness of style I make the qualifications too trifling for estimation there will be something called oratory brought up on this occasion action attitude grace elocution may be repeated as absolutely necessary to compleat the character but let us not be deceived commonsense is seldom swayed by fine tones musical periods just attitudes or the display of a white handkerchief oratorial behaviour except in very able hands indeed generally sinks into aukward and paltry affectation  IT must be observed however that these rules are calculated only for him who would instruct the vulgar who stand in most need of instruction to address philosophers and to obtain the character of a polite preacher among the politea much more useless though more soughtfor characterrequires a different method of proceeding All I shall observe on this head is to entreat the polemic divine in his controversy with the Deists to act rather offensively than to defend to push home the grounds of his belief and the impracticability of theirs rather than to spend time in solving the objections of every opponent  "It is ten to one" says a late writer on the art of war "but that the assailant who attacks the enemy in his trenches is always victorious"  YET upon the whole our clergy might employ themselves more to the benefit of society by declining all controversy than by exhibiting even the profoundest skill in polemic disputes their contests with each other often turn on speculative trifles and their disputes with the Deists are almost at an end since they can have no more than victory and that they are already possessed of as their antagonists have been driven into a confession of the necessity of revelation  or an open avowal of atheism To continue the dispute longer would only endanger it the sceptic is ever expert at puzzling a debate which he finds himself unable to continue  "and like an olympic boxer generally fights best when undermost"  ESSAY XVIII  I HAVE frequently been amazed at the ignorance of almost all the European travelers who have penetrated any considerable way eastward into Asia They have all been influenced either by motives of commerce or piety and their accounts are such as might reasonably be expected from men of a very narrow or very prejudiced education the dictates of superstition or the result of ignorance Is it not surprising that of such a variety of adventurers not one single philosopher should be found among the number For as to the travels of Gemelli the learned are long agreed that the whole is but an imposture  THERE is scarce any country how rude or uncultivated soever where the inhabitants are not possessed of some peculiar secrets either in nature or art which might be transplanted with success thus for instance in Siberian Tartary the natives extract a strong spirit from milk which is a secret probably unknown to  the chymists of Europe In the most savage parts of India they are possessed of the secret of dying vegetable substances scarlet and likewise that of refining lead into a metal which for hardness and colour is little inferior to silver not one of which secrets but would in Europe make a man's fortune The power of the Asiatics in producing winds or bringing down rain the Europeans are apt to treat as fabulous because they have no instances of the like nature among themselves but they would have treated the secrets of gunpowder and the mariner's compass in the same manner had they been told the Chinese used such arts before the invention was common with themselves at home  OF all the English philosophers I most reverence Bacon that great and hardy genius he it is who undaunted by the seeming difficulties that oppose prompts human curiosity to examine every part of nature and even exhorts man to try whether he cannot subject the tempest the thunder and even earthquakes to human controul Oh had a man of his daring spirit of his genius penetration and learning travelled to those countries which have been visited only by the superstitious and mercenary  what might not mankind expect How would he enlighten the regions to which he travelled and what a variety of knowledge and useful improvement would he not bring back in exchange  THERE is probably no country so barbarous that would not disclose all it knew if it received equivalent information and I am apt to think that a person who was ready to give more knowledge than he received would be welcome wherever he came All his care in travelling should only be to suit his intellectual banquet to the people with whom he conversed he should not attempt to teach the unlettered Tartar astronomy nor yet instruct the polite Chinese in the arts of subsistence he should endeavour to improve the barbarian in the secrets of living comfortably and the inhabitant of a more refined country in the speculative pleasures of science How much more nobly would a philosopher thus employed spend his time than by sitting at home earnestly intent upon adding one star more to his catalogue or one monster more to his collection or still if possible more triflingly sedulous in the incatenation of fleas or the sculpture of cherrystones  I NEVER consider this subject without being surprised that none of those societies so laudably established in England for the promotion of arts and learning have ever thought of sending one of their members into the most eastern parts of Asia to make what discoveries he was able To be convinced of the utility of such an undertaking let them but read the relations of their own travellers It will there be found that they are as often deceived themselves as they attempt to deceive others The merchants tell us perhaps the price of different commodities the methods of bailing them up and the properest manner for an European to preserve his health in the country The missioner on the other hand informs us with what pleasure the country to which he was sent embraced Christianity and the numbers he converted what methods he took to keep Lent in a region where there was no fish or the shifts be made to celebrate the rites of his religion in places where there was neither bread nor wine such accounts with the usual appendage of marriages and funerals inscriptions rivers and mountains make up the whole of an European traveller's diary but as to all the secrets of which the inhabitants are possessed those are universally attributed to magic and  when the traveller can give no other account of the wonders he sees performed he very contentedly ascribes them to the devil  IT was an usual observation of Boyle the English chymist that if every artist would but discover what new observations occurred to him in the exercise of his trade philosophy would thence gain innumerable improvements It may be observed with still greater justice that if the useful knowledge of every country howsoever barbarous was gleaned by a judicious observer the advantages would be inestimable Are there not even in Europe many useful inventions known or practised but in one place Their instrument as an example for cutting down corn in Germany is much more handy and expeditious in my opinion than the sickle used in England The cheap and expeditious manner of making vinegar without previous fermentation is known only in a part of France If such discoveries therefore remain still to be known at home what funds of knowledge might not be collected in countries yet unexplored or only passed through by ignorant travellers in hasty caravans  THE caution with which foreigners are received in Asia may be alledged as an objection to such a design But how readily have several European merchants found admission into regions the most suspicious under the character of Sanjapins or northern pilgrims To such not even China itself denies access  TO send out a traveller properly qualified for these purposes might be an object of national concern it would in some measure repair the breaches made by ambition and might shew that there were still some who boasted a greater name than that of patriots who professed themselves lovers of men  THE only difficulty would remain in chusing a proper person for so arduous an enterprize He should be a man of a philosophical turn one apt to deduce consequences of general utility from particular occurrences neither swoln with pride nor hardened by prejudice neither weded to one particular system nor instructed only in one particular science neither wholly a botanist nor quite an antiquarian his mind should be tinctured with miscellaneous knowledge and his manners humanized by an intercourse  with men He should be in some measure an enthusiast to the design fond of travelling from a rapid imagination and an innate love of change furnished with a body capable of sustaining every fatigue and a heart not easily terrified at danger  ESSAY XIX  THE improvements we make in mental acquirements only render us each day more sensible of the defects of our constitution with this in view therefore let us often recur to the amusements of youth endeavour to forget age and wisdom and as far as innocence goes be as much a boy as the best of them  LET idle declaimers mourn over the degeneracy of the age but in my opinion every age is the same This I am sure of that man in every season is a poor fretful being with no other means to escape the calamities of the times but by endeavouring to forget them for if he attempts to resist he is certainly undone If I feel poverty and pain I am not so hardy as to quarrel with the executioner even while under correction I find myself no way disposed to make fine speeches while I am making wry faces In a word let me drink when the fit is on to make me insensible and drink when it is over for joy that I feel pain no longer  THE character of old Falstaff even with all his faults gives me more consolation than the most studied efforts of wisdom I here behold an agreeable old fellow forgetting age and shewing me the way to be young at sixtyfive Sure I am well able to be as merry though not so comical as heIs it not in my power to have though not so much wit at least as much vivacityAge care wisdom reflection be goneI give you to the winds Let's have t'other bottle here's to the memory of Shakespear Falstaff and all the merry men of Eastcheap  SUCH were the reflections that naturally arose while I sat at the Boar's head tavern still kept at Eastcheap Here by a pleasant fire in the very room where old Sir John Falstaff cracked his jokes in the very chair which was sometimes honoured by prince Henry and sometimes polluted by his immoral merry companions I sat and ruminated on the follies of youth wished to be young again but was resolved to make the best of life while it lasted and now and then compared past and present times together I considered myself as the only living representative of the old knight and transported my imagination back to the times  when the prince and he gave life to the revel and made even debauchery not disgusting The room also conspired to throw my reflections back into antiquity the oak floor the Gothic windows and the ponderous chimneypiece had long withstood the tooth of time the watchman had gone twelve my companions had all stolen off and none now remained with me but the landlord From him I could have wished to know the history of a tavern that had such a long succession of customers I could not help thinking that an account of this kind would be a pleasing contrast of the manners of different ages but my landlord could give me no information He continued to doze and sot and tell a tedious story as most other landlords usually do and though he said nothing yet was never silent one good joke followed another good joke and the best joke of all was generally begun towards ths end of a bottle I found at last however his wine and his conversation operate by degrees he insensibly began to alter his appearance His cravat seemed quilled into a ruff and his breeches swelled out into a fardingale I now fancied him changing sexes and as my eyes began to close in slumber I imagined my fat landlord actually converted into as fat a landlady However sleep  made but few changes in my situation the tavern the apartment and the table continued as before nothing suffered mutation but my host who was fairly altered into a gentlewoman whom I knew to be dame Quickly mistress of this tavern in the days of Sir John and the liquor we were drinking which seemed converted into sack and sugar  "MY dear Mrs Quickly" cried I for I knew her perfectly well at first sight "I am heartily glad to see you How have you left Falstaff Pistol and the rest of our friends below stairs Brave and hearty I hope"  In good sooth replied she he did deserve to live for ever but he maketh foul work on't where he hath flitted Queen Proserpine and he have quarrelled for his attempting a rape upon her divinity and were it not that she still had bowels of compassion it more than seems probable he might have been now sprawling in Tartarus  I NOW found that spirits still preserve the frailties of the flesh and that according to the laws of critscism and dreaming ghosts have been known to be guilty of even more than platonic affection wherefore as I found her  too much moved on such a topic to proceed I was resolved to change the subject and desiring she would pledge me in a bumper observed with a sigh that our sack was nothing now to what it was in former days  "Ah Mrs Quickly those were merry times when you drew sack for prince Henry men were twice as strong and twice as wise and much braver and ten thousand times more charitable than now Those were the times The battle of Agincourt was a victory indeed Ever since that we have only been degenerating and I have lived to see the day when drinking is no longer fashionable When men wear clean shirts and women shew their necks and arms all are degenerated Mrs Quickly and we shall probably in another century be frittered away into beaus or monkeys Had you been on earth to see what I have seen it would congeal all the blood in your body your soul I mean Why our very nobility now have the intolerable arrogance in spite of what is every day remonstrated from the press our very nobility I say have the assurance to frequent assemblies and presume to be as merry as the vulgar See my very friends have scarce manhood enough to sit to it till  eleven and I only am left to make a night on't Pr'ythee do me the favour to console me a little for their absence by the story of your own adventure or the history of the tavern where we are now sitting I fancy the narrative may have something singular"  OBSERVE this apartment interrupted my companion of neat device and excellent workmanshipIn this room I have lived child woman and ghost more than three hundred years I am ordered by Pluto to keep an annual register of every transaction that passeth here and I have whilhom compiled three hundred tomes which eftsoons may be submitted to thy regards  "None of your whilhoms or eftsoons's Mrs Quickly if you please" I replied "I know you can talk every whit as well as I can for as you have lived here so long it is but natural to suppose you should learn the conversation of the company Believe me dame at best you have neither too much sense or too much language to spare so give me both as well as you can but first my service to you old women should water their clay a little now and then and now to your story"  THE story of my own adventures replied the vision is but short and unsatisfactory for believe me Mr Rigmarole believe me a woman with a butt of sack at her elbow is never longlived Sir John's death afflicted me to such a degree that I sincerely believe to drown sorrow I drank more liquor myself than I drew for my customers my grief was sincere and the sack was excellent The prior of a neighbouring convent for our priors then had as much power as a Middlesex justice now he I say it was who gave me a licence for keeping a disorderly house upon condition that I should never make hard bargains with the clergy that he should have a bottle of sack every morning and the liberty of confessing which of my girls he thought proper in private every night I had continued for several years to pay this tribute and he it must be confessed continued as rigorously to exact it I grew old insensibly my customers continued however to compliment my looks while I was by but I could hear them say I was wearing when my back was turned The prior however still was constant and so were half his convent but one fatal morning he missed the usual beverage for I had incautiously drank over night the last bottle myself What will you have  on'tThe very next day Doll Tearsheet and I were sent to the house of correction and accused of keeping a low bawdyhouse In short we were so well purified there with stripes mortification and penance that we were afterwards utterly unfit for worldly conversation though sack would have killed me had I stuck to it yet I soon died for want of a drop of something comfortable and fairly left my body to the care of the beadle  SUCH is my own history but that of the tavern where I have ever since been stationed affords greater variety In the history of this which is one of the oldest in London you may view the different manners pleasures and follies of men at different periods You will find mankind neither better nor worse now than formerly the vices of an uncivilized people are generally more detestable though not so frequent as those in polite society It is the same luxury which formerly stuffed your alderman with plumbporridge and now crams him with turtle It is the same low ambition that formerly induced a courtier to give up his religion to please his king and now persuades him to give up his conscience to please his minister It is the same vanity that formerly stained our ladies cheeks and necks with woad  and now paints them with carmine Your antient Briton formerly powdered his hair with red earth like brickdust in order to appear frightful your modern Briton cuts his hair on the crown and plaisters it with hogslard and flour and this to make him look killing It is the same vanity the same folly and the same vice only appearing different as viewed through the glass of fashion In a word all mankind are a  "SURE the woman is dreaming" interrupted I "None of your reflections Mrs Quickly if you love me they only give me the spleen Tell me your history at once I love stories but hate reasoning"  IF you please then Sir returned my companion I'll read you an abstract which I made of the three hundred volumes I mentioned just now  MY body was no sooner laid in the dust than the prior and several of his convent came to purify the tavern from the pollutions with which they said I had filled it Masses were said in every room reliques were exposed upon every piece of furniture and the whole house washed with a deluge of holywater My  habitation was soon converted into a monastery instead of customers now applying for sack and sugar my rooms were crowded with images reliques saints whores and friars Instead of being a scene of occasional debauchery it was now filled with continual lewdness The prior led the fashion and the whole convent imitated his pious example Matrons came hither to confess their sins and to commit new Virgins came hither who seldom went virgins away Nor was this a convent peculiarly wicked every convent at that period was equally fond of pleasu  e and gave a boundless loose to appetite The laws allowed it each priest had a right to a favourite companion and a power of discarding her as often as he pleased The laity grumbled quarrelled with their wives and daughters hated their confessors and maintained them in opulence and ease These these were happy times Mr Rigmarole these were times of piety bravery and simplicity  "Not so very happy neither good madam pretty much like the present those that labour starve and those that do nothing wear fine cloaths and live in luxury"  IN this manner the fathers lived for some years without molestation they transgressed  confessed themselves to each other and were forgiven One evening however our prior keeping a lady of distinction somewhat too long at confession her husband unexpectedly came upon them and testified all the indignation which was natural upon such an occasion The prior assured the gentleman that it was the devil who had put it into his heart and the lady was very certain that she was under the influence of magic or she could never have behaved in so unfaithful a manner The husband however was not to be put off by such evasions but summoned both before the tribunal of justice His proofs were flagrant and he expected large damages Such indeed he had a right to expect were the tribunals of those days constituted in the same manner as they are now The cause of the priest was to be tried before an assembly of priests and a layman was to expect redress only from their impartiality and candour What plea then do you think the prior made to obviate this accusation He denied the fact and challenged the plaintiff to try the merits of their cause by single combat It was a little hard you may be sure upon the poor gentleman not only to be made a cuckold but to be obliged to fight a duel into the bargain yet such was the justice of the times  The prior threw down his glove and the injured husband was obliged to take it up in token of his accepting the challenge Upon this the priest supplied his champion for it was not lawful for the clergy to fight and the defendant and plaintiff according to custom were put in prison both ordered to fast and pray every method being previously used to induce both to a confession of the truth After a month's imprisonment the hair of each was cut the bodies anointed with oil the field of battle appointed and guarded by soldiers while his majesty presided over the whole in person Both the champions were sworn not to seek victory either by fraud or magic They prayed and confessed upon their knees and after these ceremonies the rest was left to the courage and conduct of the combatants As the champion whom the prior had pitched upon had fought six or eight times upon similar occasions it was no way extraordinary to find him victorious in the present combat In short the husband was discomfitted he was taken from the field of battle stripped to his shirt and after one of his legs were cut off as justice ordained in such cases he was hanged as a terror to future offenders These those were the times Mr Rigmarole you see how much more just  and wise and valiant our ancestors were than us  "I rather fancy madam that the times then were pretty much like our own where a multiplicity of laws give a judge as much power as a want of law since he is ever sure to find among the number some to countenance his partiality"  OUR convent victorious over their enemies now gave a loose to every demonstration of joy The lady became a nun the prior was made a bishop and three Wickliffites were burned in the illuminations and fireworks that were made on the present occasion Our convent now began to enjoy a very high degree of reputation There was not one in London that had the character of hating heretics so much as ours Ladies of the first distinction chose from our convent their confessors in short it flourished and might have flourished to this hour but for a fatal accident which terminated in its overthrow The lady whom the prior had placed in a nunnery and whom he continued to visit for some time with great punctuality began at last to perceive that she was quite forsaken Secluded from conversation as usual she now entertained the visions of a devotee found herself strangely disturbed but hesitated  in determining whether she was possessed by an angel or a daemon She was not long in suspence for upon vomiting a large quantity of crooked pins and finding the palms of her hands turned outwards she quickly concluded that she was possessed by the devil She soon lost entirely the use of speech and when she seemed to speak every body that was present perceived that her voice was not her own but that of the devil within her In short she was bewitched and all the difficulty lay in determining who it could be that bewitched her The nuns and the monks all demanded the magician's name but the devil made no reply for he knew they had no authority to ask questions By the rules of witchcraft when an evil spirit has taken possession he may refuse to answer any questions asked him unless they are put by a bishop and to these he is obliged to reply A bishop therefore was sent for and now the whole secret came out the devil reluctantly owned that he was a servant of the prior that by his command he resided in his present habitation and that without his command he was resolved to keep in possession The bishop was an able exorcist he drove the devil out by force of mystical arms the prior was arraigned for witchcraft the witnesses were strong and  numerous against him not less than fourteen persons being by who heard the devil talk Latin There was no resisting such a cloud of witnesses the prior was condemned and he who had assisted at so many burnings was burned himself in turn These were times Mr Rigmarole the people of those times were not infidels as now but sincere believers  "Equally faulty with ourselves they believed what the devil was pleased to tell them and we seem resolved at last to believe neither God nor devil"  AFTER such a stain upon the convent it was not to be supposed it could subsist any longer the fathers were ordered to decamp and the house was once again converted into a tavern The king conferred it on one of his east mistresses she was constituted landlady by royal authority and as the tavern was in the neighbourhood of the court and the mistress a very polite woman it began to have more business than ever and sometimes took not less than four shillings a day  BUT perhaps you are desirous of knowing what were the peculiar qualifications of women of fashion at that period and in a description  of the present landlady you will have a tolerable idea of all the rest This lady was the daughter of a nobleman and received such an education in the country as became her quality beauty and great expectations She could make shifts and hose for herself and all the servants of the family when she was twelve years old She knew the names of the four and twenty letters so that it was impossible to bewitch her and this was a greater piece of learning than any lady in the whole country could pretend to She was always up early and saw breakfast served in the great hall by six o'clock At this scene of festivity she generally improved goodhumour by telling her dreams relating stories of spirits several of which she herself had seen and one of which she was reported to have killed with a blackhasted knife From hence she usually went to make pastry in the larder and here she was followed by her sweethearts who were much helped on in conversation by struggling with her for kisses About ten miss generally went to play at hotcockles and blindman's buff in the parlour and when the young folks for they seldom played at hotcockles when grown old were tired of such amusements the gentlemen entertained miss with the history of their greyhounds  bearbaitings and victories at cudgelplaying If the weather was fine they ran at the ring shot at butts while miss held in her hand a ribbon with which she adorned the conqueror Her mental qualifications were exactly fitted to her external accomplishments Before she was fifteen she could tell the story of Jack the Giant Killer could name every mountain that was inhabited by fairies knew a witch at first sight and could repeat four Latin prayers without a prompter Her dress was perfectly fashionable her arms and her hair were completely covered a monstrous ruff was put round her neck so that her head seemed like that of John the Baptist placed in a charger In short when completely equipped her appearance was so very modest that she discovered little more than her nose These were the times Mr Rigmarole when every lady that had a good nose might set up for a beauty when every woman that could tell stories might be cried up for a wit  "I am as much displeased at those dresses which conceal too much as at those which discover too much I am equally an enemy to a female dunce or a female pedant"  YOU may be sure that miss chose a husband with qualifications resembling her own  she pitched upon a courtier equally remarkable for hunting and drinking who had given several proofs of his great virility among the daughters of his tenants and domestics They fell in love at first sight for such was the gallantry of the times were married came to court and madam appeared with superior qualifications The king was struck with her beauty All property was at the king's command the husband was obliged to resign all pretensions in his wise to the sovereign whom God had anointed to commit adultery where he thought proper The king loved her for some time but at length repenting of his misdeeds and instigated by his fatherconfessor from a principle of conscience removed her from his levee to the bar of this tavern and took a new mistress in her stead Let it not surprize you to behold the mistress of a king degraded to so humble an office As the ladies had no mental accomplishments a good face was enough to raise them to the royal couch and she who was this day a royal mistress might the next when her beauty palled upon enjoyment be doomed to infamy and want  UNDER the care of this lady the tavern grew into great reputation the courtiers had  not yet learned to game but they paid it off by drinking drunkenness is ever the vice of a barbarous and gaming of a luxurious age They had not such frequent entertainments as the moderns have but were more expensive and more luxurious in those they had All their fooleries were more elaborate and more admired by the great and the vulgar than now A courtier has been known to spend his whole fortune at a single feast a king to mortgage his dominions to furnish out the fripery of a tournament There were certain days appointed for riot and debauchery and to be sober at such times was reputed a crime Kings themselves set the example and I have seen monarchs in this room drunk before the entertainment was half concluded These were the times Sir when kings kept mistresses and got drunk in public they were too plain and simple in those happy times to hide their vices and act the hypocrite as now  "Lord Mrs Quickly" interrupting her "I expected to have heard a story and here you are going to tell me I know not what of times and vices pr'ythee let me intreat thee once more to wave reflections and give thy history without deviation"  NO lady upon earth continued my visionary correspondent knew how to put off her damaged  wine or women with more art than she When these grew flat or those paltry it was but changing the names the wine became excellent and the girls agreeable She was also possessed of the engaging leer the chuck under the chin winked at a doubleentendre could  ick the opportunity of calling for something comfortable and perfectly understood the discreet moments when to withdraw The gallants of those times pretty much resembled the bloods of ours they were fond of pleasure but quite ignorant of the art of refining upon it thus a court bawd of those times resembled the common lowlived harridan of a modern bagnio Witness ye powers of debauchery how often I have been present at the various appearances of drunkenness riot guilt and brutality A tavern is a true picture of human infirmity in history we find only one side of the age exhibited to our view but in the account of a tavern we see every age equally absurd and equally vicious  UPON this lady's decease the tavern was successively occupied by adventurers bullies pimps and gamesters Towards the conclusion of the reign of Henry VII gaming was more universally practised in England than even now  Kings themselves have been known to play off at Primero not only all the money and jewels they could part with but the very images in churches The last Henry played away in this very room not only the four great bells of St Paul's cathedral but the fine image of St Paul which stood upon the top of the spire to Sir Miles Partridge who took them down the next day and sold them by auction Have you then any cause to regret being born in the times you now live or do you still believe that human nature continues to run on declining every age If we observe the actions of the bufy part of mankind your ancestors will be found infinitely more gross servile and even dishonest than you If forsaking history we only trace them in their hours of amusement and dissipation we shall find them more sensual more entirely devoted to pleasure and infinitely more selfish  THE last hostess of note I find upon record was Jane Rouse She was born among the lower ranks of the people and by frugality and extreme complaisance contrived to acquire a moderate fortune this she might have enjoyed for many years had she not unfortunately quarrelled with one of her neighbours a woman who  was in high repute for sanctity through the whole parish In the times of which I speak two women seldom quarrelled that one did not accuse the other of witchcraft and she who first contrived to vomit crooked pins was sure to come off victorious The scandal of a modern teatable differs widely from the scandal of former times the fascination of a lady's eyes at present is regarded as a compliment but if a lady formerly should be accused of having witchcraft in her eyes it were much better both for her soul and body that she had no eyes at all  IN short Jane Rouse was accused of witchcraft and though she made the best defence she could it was all to no purpose she was taken from her own bar to the bar of the OldBailey condemned and executed accordingly These were times indeed when even women could not scold in safety  SINCE her time the tavern underwent several revolutions according to the spirit of the times or the disposition of the reigning monarch It was this day a brothel and the next a conventicle for enthusiasts It was one year noted for harbouring whigs and the next infamous  for a retreat to tories Some years ago it was in high vogue but at present it seems declining This only may be remarked in general that whenever taverns flourish most the times are then most extravagant and luxurious  "Lord Mrs Quickly" interrupted I "you have really deceived me I expected a romance and here you have been this half hour giving me only a description of the spirit of the times if you have nothing but tedious remarks to communicate seek some other hearer I am determined to hearken only to stories"  I HAD scarce concluded when my eyes and ears seemed opened to my landlord who had been all this while giving me an account of the repairs he had made in the house and was now got into the story of the cracked glass in the diningroom  ESSAY XX  WHATEVER may be the merits of the English in other sciences they seem peculiarly excellent in the art of healing There is scarcely a disorder incident to humanity against which our advertising doctors are not possessed with a most infallible antidote The professors of other arts confess the inevitable intricacy of things talk with doubt and decide with hesitation but doubting is entirely unknown in medicine the advertising professors here delight in cases of difficulty be the disorder never so desperate or radical you will find numbers in every street who by leveling a pill at the part affected promise a certain cure without loss of time knowledge of a bedfellow or hindrance of business  WHEN I consider the assiduity of this profession their benevolence amazes me They not only in general give their medicines for half value but use the most persuasive remonstrances to induce the sick to come and be cured Sure there must be something strangely obstinate  in an English patient who refuses so much health upon such easy terms Does he take a pride in being bloated with a dropsy Does he find pleasure in the alternations of an intermittent fever Or feel as much satisfaction in nursing up his gout▪ as he found pleasure in acquiring it He must otherwise he would never reject such repeated assurances of instant relief What can be more convincing than the manner in which the sick are invited to be well The doctor first begs the most earnest attention of the public to what he is going to propose he solemnly affirms the pill was never sound to want success he produces a list of those who have been rescued from the grave by taking it Yet notwithstanding all this there are many here who now and then think proper to be sick only sick did I say There are some who even think proper to die Yes by the head of Confucius they die though they might have purchased the healthrestoring specific for half a crown at every corner  I CAN never enough admire the sagacity of this country for the encouragement given to the professors of this art with what indulgence does she foster up those of her own growth and  kindly cherish those that come from abroad Like a skilful gardener she invites them from every foreign climate to herself Here every great exotic strikes root as soon as imported and feels the genial beam of favour while the mighty metropolis like one vast munificent dunghill receives them indiscriminately to her breast and supplies each with more than native nourishment  IN other countries the physician pretends to cure disorders in the lump the same doctor who combats the gout in the toe shall pretend to prescribe for a pain in the head and he who at one time cures a consumption shall at another give drugs for a dropsy How absurd and ridiculous This is being a mere jack of all trades Is the animal machine less complicated than a brass pin Not less than ten different hands are required to make a brass pin and shall the body be set right by one single operator  THE English are sensible of the force of this reasoning they have therefore one doctor for the eyes another for the toes they have their sciatica doctors and inoculating doctors they have one doctor who is modestly content with  securing them from bugbites and five hundred who prescribe for the bite of mad dogs  BUT as nothing pleases curiosity more than anecdotes of the great however minute or trifling I must present you inadequate as my abilities are to the subject with an account of one or two of those personages who lead in this honourable profession  THE first upon the list of glory is doctor Richard Rock F U N This great man is short of stature is fat and waddles as he walks He always wears a white threetailed wig nicely combed and frizzled upon each cheek Sometimes he carries a cane but a hat never it is indeed very remarkable that this extraordinary personage should never wear a hat but so it is an hat he never wears He is usually drawn at the top of his own bills sitting in his armchair holding a little bottle between his finger and thumb and surrounded with rotten teeth nippers pills pacquets and gallypots No man can promise fairer or better than he for as he observes  "Be your disorder never so far gone be under no uneasiness make yourself quite easy I can cure you"  THE next in fame though by some reckoned of equal pretensions is doctor Timothy Franks F O G H living in the Old Bailey As Rock is remarkably squab his great rival Franks is as remarkably tall He was born in the year of the Christian aera and is while I now write exactly sixtyeight years three months and four days old Age however has no ways impaired his usual health and vivacity I am told he generally walks with his breast open This gentleman who is of a mixed reputation is particularly remarkable for a becoming assurance which carries him gently through life for except doctor Rock none are more blessed with the advantages of face than doctor Franks  And yet the great have their foibles as well as the little I am almost ashamed to mention it Let the foibles of the great rest in peace Yet I must impart the wholeThese two great men are actually now at variance like mere men mere common mortals Rock advises the world to beware of bogtrotting quacks Franks retorts the wit and the sarcasm by fixing on his rival the odious appellation of Dumpling Dick He calls the serious doctor Rock Dumpling Dick Head of Confucius what  profanation Dumplin Dick What a pity ye powers that the learned who were born mutually to assist in enlightening the world should thus differ among themselves and make even the profession ridiculous Sure the world is wide enough at least for two great personages to figure in men of science should leave controversy to the little world below them and then we might see Rock and Franks walking together hand in hand smiling onward to immortality  ESSAY XXI  I AM fond of amusement in whatever company it is to be found and wit though dressed in rags is ever pleasing to me I went some days ago to take a walk in St James's Park about the hour in which company leave it to go to dinner There were but few in the walks and those who stayed seemed by their looks rather more willing to forget that they had an appetite than gain one I sat down on one of the benches at the other end of which was seated a man in very shabby cloaths  WE continued to groan to hem and to cough as usual upon such occasions and at last ventured upon conversation  "I beg pardon sir" cried I "but I think I have seen you before your face is familiar to me"  "Yes sir" replied he "I have a good familiar face as my friends tell me I am as well known in every town in England as the dromedary or live crocodile You must understand sir that I have been these sixteen years Merry Andrew to a puppetshew  last Bartholomew fair my master and I quarrelled beat each other and parted he to sell his puppets to the pincushionmakers in Rosemarylane and I to starve in St James's Park"  "I AM sorry sir that a person of your appearance should labour under any difficulties"  "O sir" returned he "my appearance is very much at your service but though I cannot boast of eating much yet there are few that are merrier if I had twenty thousand a year I should be very merry and thank the fates though not worth a groat I am very merry still If I have three pence in my pocket I never refuse to be my three halfpence and if I have no money I never scorn to be treated by any that are kind enough to pay my reckoning What think you sir of a steak and a tankard You shall treat me now and I will treat you again when I find you in the Park in love with eating and without money to pay for a dinner"  AS I never refuse a small expence for the sake of a merry companion we instantly adjourned to a neighbouring alehouse and in a  few moments had a frothing tankard and a smoaking steak spread on the table before us It is impossible to express how much the sight of such good cheer improved my companion's vivacity  "I like this dinner sir" says he "for three reasons first because I am naturally fond of beef secondly because I am hungry and thirdly and lastly because I get it for nothing no meat eats so sweet as that for which we do not pay"  HE therefore now fell to and his appetite seemed to correspond with his inclination After dinner was over he observed that the steak was tough  "and yet sir" returns he "bad as it was it seemed a rumpsteak to me O the delights of poverty and a good appetite We beggars are the very soundlings of nature the rich she treats like an arrant stepmother they are pleased with nothing cut a steak from what part you will and it is insupportably tough dress it up with pickles and even pickles cannot procure them an appetite But the whole creation is filled with good things for the beggar Calvert's butt outtastes champagne and Sedgeley's homebrewed excels tokay Joy joy my blood though our estates lie no where we have  fortunes wherever we go If an inundation sweeps away half the grounds of Cornwall I am content I have no lands there if the stocks sink that gives me no uneasiness I am no Jew"  The fellows vivacity joined to his poverty I own raised my curiosity to know something of his life and circumstances and I entreated that he would indulge my desire  "That I will sir" said he "and welcome only let us drink to prevent our sleeping let us have another tankard while we are awake let us have another tankard for ah how charming a tankard looks when full"  "YOU must know then that I am very well descended my ancestors have made some noise in the world for my mother cried oysters and my father beat a drum I am told we have even had some trumpeters in our family Many a nobleman cannot shew so respectful a genealogy but that is neither here nor there As I was their only child my father designed to breed me up to his own employment which was that of drummer to a puppetshew Thus the whole employment of my younger years was that of interpreter to Punch and king Solomon in all  his glory But though my father was very fond of instructing me in beating all the marches and points of war I made no very great progress because I naturally had no ear for music so at the age of fifteen I went and listed for a soldier As I had ever hated beating a drum so I soon found that I disliked carrying a musquet also neither the one trade nor the other were to my taste for I was by nature fond of being a gentleman besides I was obliged to obey my captain he has his will I have mine and you have yours now I very reasonably concluded that it was much more comfortable for a man to obey his own will than another's  "THE life of a soldier soon therefore gave me the spleen I asked leave to quit the service but as I was tall and strong my captain thanked me for my kind intention and said because he had a regard for me we should not part I wrote to my father a very dismal penitent letter and desired that he would raise money to pay for my discharge but the good man was as fond of drinking as I was Sir my service to you and those who are fond of drinking never pay for other people's discharges in short  he never answered my letter What could be done If I have not money said I to myself to pay for my discharge I must find an equivalent some other way and that must be by running away I deserted and that answered my purpose every bit as well as if I had bought my discharge  "WELL I was now fairly rid of my military employment I sold my soldier's cloaths bought worse and in order not to be overtaken took the most unfrequented roads possible One evening as I was entering a village I perceived a man whom I afterwards found to be the curate of the parish thrown from his horse in a miry road and almost smothered in the mud He desired my assistance I gave it and drew him out with some difficulty He thanked me for my trouble and was going off but I followed him home for I loved always to have a man thank me at his own door The curate asked an hundred questions as whose son I was from whence I came and whether I would be faithful I answered him greatly to his satisfaction and gave myself one of the best characters in the world for sobriety Sir I have the honour of drinking your health▪  discretion and fidelity To make a long story short he wanted a servant and hired me With him I lived but two months we did not much like each other I was fond of eating and he gave me but little to eat▪ I loved a pretty girl and the old woman my fellowservant was illnatured and ugly As they endeavoured to starve me between them I made a pious resolution to prevent their committing murder I stole the eggs as soon as they were laid I emptied every unfinished bottle that I could lay my hands on whatever eatable came in my way was sure to disappear in short they found I would not do so I was discharged one morning and paid three shillings and sixpence for two months wages  "WHILE my money was getting ready I employed myself in making preparations for my departure two hens were hatching in an outhouse I went and took the eggs from habit and not to separate the parents from the children I lodged hens and all in my knapsack After this piece of frugality I returned to receive my money and with my knapsack on my back and a staff in my hand I bid adieu with tears in my eyes to  my old benefactor I had not gone far from the house when I heard behind me the cry of Stop thief but this only increased my dispatch it would have been foolish to stop as I knew the voice could not be levelled at me But hold I think I passed those two months at the curate's without drinking come the times are dry and may this be my poison if ever I spent two more pious stupid months in all my life  "WELL after travelling some days whom should I light upon but a company of strolling players The moment I saw them at a distance my heart warmed to them I had a sort of natural love for every thing of the vagabond order they were employed in setling their baggage which had been overturned in a narrow way I offered my assistance which they accepted and we soon became so well acquainted that they took me as a servant This was a paradise to me they sung danced drank eat and travelled all at the same time By the blood of the Mirabels I thought I had never lived till then I grew as merry as a grig and laughed at every word that was spoken They liked me as much as I liked them I  was a very good figure as you see and though I was poor I was not modest  "I LOVE a straggling life above all things in the world sometimes good sometimes bad to be warm today and cold tomorrow to eat when one can get it and drink when the tankard is out it stands before me We arrived that evening at Tenterden and took a large room at the Greyhound where we resolved to exhibit Romeo and Juliet with the funeral procession the grave and the garden scene Romeo was to be performed by a gentleman from the TheatreRoyal in DruryLane Juliet by a lady who had never appeared on any stage before and I was to snuff the candles all excellent in our way We had figures enough but the difficulty was to dress them The same coat that served Romeo turned with the blue lining outwards served for his friend Mercutio a large piece of crape sufficed at once for Juliet's petticoat and pall a pestle and mortar from a neighbouring apothecary's answered all the purposes of a bell and our landlord's own family wrapped in white sheets served to fill up the procession In short there were but three figures among  us that might be said to be dressed with any propriety I mean the nurse the starved apothecary and myself Our performance gave universal satisfaction the whole audience were enchanted with our powers"  "THERE is one rule by which a strollingplayer may be ever secure of success that is in our theatrical way of expressing it to make a great deal of the character To speak and act as in common life is not playing nor is it what people come to see natural speaking like sweet wine runs glibly over the palate and scarce leaves any taste behind it but being high in a part resembles vinegar which grates upon the taste and one feels it while he is drinking To please in town or country the way is to cry wring cringe into attitudes mark the emphasis slap the pockets and labour like one in the falling sickness that is the way to work for applause that is the way to gain it  "AS we received much reputation for our skill on this first exhibition it was but natural for me to ascribe part of the success to myself I snuffed the candles and let me  tell you that without a candlesnuffer the piece would lose half its embellishments In this manner we continued a fortnight and drew tolerable houses but the evening before our intended departure we gave out our very best piece in which all our strength was to be exerted We had great expectations from this and even doubled our prices when behold one of the principal actors fell ill of a violent fever This was a stroke like thunder to our little company they were resolved to go in a body to scold the man for falling sick at so inconvenient a time and that too of a disorder that threatened to be expensive I seized the moment and offered to act the part myself in his stead The case was desperate they accepted my offer and I accordingly sat down with the part in my hand and a tankard before me Sir your health and studied the character which was to be rehearsed the next day and played soon after  "I found my memory excessively helped by drinking I learned my part with astonishing rapidity and bid adieu to snuffing candles ever after I found that nature had designed me for more noble employments and I was resolved to take her when in the humor  We got together in order to rehearse and I informed my companions masters now no longer of the surprising change I felt within me Let the sick man said I be under no uneasiness to get well again I'll fill his place to universal satisfaction he may even die if he thinks proper I'll engage that he shall never be missed I rehearsed before them strutted ranted and received applause They soon gave out that a new actor of eminence was to appear and immediately all the genteel places were bespoke Before I ascended the stage however I concluded within myself that as I brought money to the house I ought to have my share in the profits Gentlemen said I addressing our company I don't pretend to direct you far be it from me to treat you with so much ingratitude you have published my name in the bills with the utmost good nature and as affairs stand cannot act without me so gentlemen to shew you my gratitude I expect to be paid for my acting as much as any of you otherwise I declare off I'll brandish my snuffers and clip candles as usual This was a very disagreeable proposal but they found that it was impossible to refuse it it was irresistible  it was adamant they consented and I went on in king Bajazet my frowning brows bound with a stocking stuffed into a turban while on my captiv'd arms I brandished a jackchain Nature seemed to have fitted me for the part I was tall and had a loud voice my very entrance excited universal applause I looked round on the audience with a smile and made a most low and graceful bow for that is the rule among us As it was a very passionate part I invigorated my spirits with three full glasses the tankard is almost out of brandy By Alla it is almost inconceivable how I went through it Tamerlane was but a fool to me though he was sometimes loud enough too yet I was still louder than he but then besides I had attitudes in abundance in general I kept my arms folded up thus upon the pit of my stomach it is the way at DruryLane and has always a fine effect The tankard would sink to the bottom before I could get through the whole of my merits in short I came off like a prodigy and such was my success that I could ravish the laurels even from a sirloin of beef The principal gentlemen and ladies of the town came to me after the play was over to  compliment me upon my success one praised my voice another my person Upon my word says the 'squire's lady he will make one of the finest actors in Europe I say it and I think I am something of a judge Praise in the beginning is agreeable enough and we receive it as a favour but when it comes in great quantities we regard it only as a debt which nothing but our merit could extort instead of thanking them I internally applauded myself We were desired to give our piece a second time we obeyed and I was applauded even more than before  "AT last we left the town in order to be at a horserace at some distance from thence I shall never think of Tenterden without tears of gratitude and respect The ladies and gentlemen there take my word for it are very good judges of plays and actors Come let us drink their healths if you please sir We quitted the town I say and there was a wide difference between my coming in and going out I entered the town a candlesnuffer and I quitted it an heroSuch is the world little today and great tomorrow I could say a great  deal more upon that subject something truly sublime upon the ups and downs of fortune but it would give us both the spleen and so I shall pass it over  "THE races were ended before we arrived at the next town which was no small disappointment to our company however we were resolved to take all we could get I played capital characters there too and came off with my usual brilliancy I sincerely believe I should have been the first actor of Europe had my growing merit been properly cultivated but there came an unkindly frost which nipped me in the bud and levelled me once more down to the common standard of humanity I played Sir Harry Wildair all the country ladies were charmed if I but drew out my snuffbox the whole house was in a roar of rapture when I exercised my cudgel I thought they would have fallen into convulsions  "THERE was here a lady who had received an education of nine months in London and this gave her pretensions to taste which rendered her the indisputable mistress of the ceremonies wherever she came She  was informed of my merits every body praised me yet she refused at first going to see me perform she could not conceive she said any thing but stuff from a stroller talked something in praise of Garrick and amazed the ladies with her skill in enunciations tones and cadences she was at last however prevailed upon to go and it was privately intimated to me what a judge was to be present at my next exhibition however no way intimidated I came on in Sir Harry one hand stuck in my breeches and the other in my bosom as usual at DruryLane but instead of looking at me I perceived the whole audience had their eyes turned upon the lady who had been nine months in London from her they expected the decision which was to secure the general's truncheon in my hand or sink me down into a theatrical lettercarrier I opened my snuffbox took snuff the lady was solemn and so were the rest I broke my cudgel on alderman Smuggler's back still gloomy melancholly all the lady groaned and shruged her shoulders I attempted by laughing myself to excite at least a smile but the devil a cheek could I perceive wrinkled into sympathy I found it would not do all my  goodhumour now became forced my laughter was converted into hysteric grining and while I pretended spirits my eye shewed the agony of my heart in short the lady came with an intention to be displeased and displeased she was my fame expired I am here and the tankard is no more"  ESSAY XXII  WHEN Catharina Alexowna was made empress of Russia the women were in an actual state of bondage but she undertook to introduce mixed assemblies as in other parts of Europe she altered the women's dress by substituting the fashions of England instead of furs she brought in the use of taffeta and damask and cornets and commodes instead of caps of sable The women now found themselves no longer shut up in separate apartments but saw company visited each other and were present at every entertainment  BUT as the laws to this effect were directed to a savage people it is amusing enough the manner in which the ordinances ran Assemblies were quite unknown among them the czarina was satisfied with introducing them for she found it impossible to render them polite An ordinance was therefore published according to their notions of breeding which as it is a curiosity and has never before been printed that we know of we shall give our readers  "I The person at whose house the assembly is to be kept shall signify the same by hanging out a bill or by giving some other public notice by way of advertisement to persons of both sexes  "II THE assembly shall not be open sooner than four or five o'clock in the afternoon nor continue longer than ten at night  "III THE master of the house shall not be obliged to meet his guests or conduct them out or keep them company but though he is exempt from all this he is to find them chairs candles liquors and all other necessaries that company may ask for he is likewise to provide them with cards dice and every necessary for gaming  "IV THERE shall be no fixed hour for coming or going away it is enough for a person to appear in the assembly"  "V EVERY one shall be free to sit walk or game as he pleases nor shall any one go about to hinder him or take exceptions at what he does upon pain of emptying the  great eagle a pintbowl full of brandy it shall likewise be sufficient at entering or retiring to salute the company  "VI PERSONS of distinction noblemen superior officers merchants and tradesmen of note headworkmen especially carpenters and persons employed in chancery are to have liberty to enter the assemblies as likewise their wives and children  "VII A PARTICULAR place shall be assigned the footmen except those of the house that there may be room enough in the apartments designed for the assembly"  "VIII No ladies are to get drunk upon any pretence whatsoever nor shall gentlemen be drunk before nine"  "IX LADIES who play at forfeitures questions and commands c shall not be riotous no gentleman shall attempt to force a kiss and no person shall offer to strike a woman in the assembly under pain of future exclusion"  SUCH are the statutes upon this occasion which in their very appearance carry an air of ridicule and satire But politeness must enter every country by degrees and these rules resemble the breeding of a clown aukward but sincere  ESSAY XXIII  THE formalities delays and disappointments that precede a treaty of marriage here are usually as numerous as those previous to a treaty of peace The laws of this country are finely calculated to promote all commerce but the commerce between the sexes Their encouragements for propagating hemp madder and tobacco are indeed admirable Marriages are the only commodity that meets with none  YET from the vernal softness of the air the verdure of the fields the transparency of the streams and the beauty of the women I know few countries more proper to invite to courtship Here love might sport among painted lawns and warbling groves and revel amidst gales wafting at once both fragrance and harmony Yet it seems he has forsaken the island and when a couple are now to be married mutual love or an union of minds is the last and most trifling consideration If their goods and chattles can be brought to unite their  sympathetic souls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty The gentleman's morgaged lawn becomes enamoured of the ladies marriageable grove the match is struck up and both parties are piously in loveaccording to act of parliament  THUS they who have fortune are possessed at least of something that is lovely but I actually pity those that have none I am told there was a time when ladies with no other merit but youth virtue and beauty had a chance for husbands at least among the ministers of the church or the officers of the army The blush and innocence of sixteen was said to have a powerful influence over these two professions But of late all the little traffic of blushing ogling dimpling and smiling has been forbidden by an act in that case wisely made and provided A lady's whole cargo of smiles sighs and whispers is declared utterly contraband till she arrives in the warm latitudes of twentytwo where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay She is then permitted to dimple and smile when the dimples and smiles begin to forsake her and when perhaps grown ugly is charitably entrusted with an unlimited use of her charms  Her lovers however by this time have forsaken her the captain has changed for another mistress the priest himself leaves her in solitude to bewail her virginity and she dies even without benefit of clergy  THUS you find the Europeans discouraging love with as much earnestness as the rudest savage of Sofala The genius is surely now no more In every region I find enemies in arms to oppress him Avarice in Europe jealousy in Persia ceremony in China poverty among the Tartars and lust in Circassia are all prepared to oppose his power The genius is certainly banished from earth though once adored under such a variety of forms He is no where to be found and all that the ladies of each country can produce are but a few trifling reliques as instances of his former residence and favour  "THE genius of Love" says the Eastern Apologue "had long resided in the happy plains of Abra where every breeze was health and every sound produced traquility His temple at first was crowded but every age lessened the number of his votaries or cooled their devotion Perceiving therefore  his altars at length quite deserted he was resolved to remove to some more propitious region and he apprized the fair sex of every country where he could hope for a proper reception to assert their right to his presence among them In return to this proclamation embassies were sent from the ladies of every part of the world to invite him and to display the superiority of their claims  "AND first the beauties of China appeared No country could compare with them for modesty either of look dress or behaviour their eyes were never lifted from the ground their robes of the most beautiful silk hid their hands bosom and neck while their faces only were left uncovered They indulged no airs that might express loose desire and they seemed to study only the graces of inanimate beauty Their black teeth and plucked eyebrows were however alledged by the genius against them but he set them entirely aside when he came to examine their little feet  "THE beauties of Circassia next made their appearance They advanced hand in hand singing the most immodest airs and leading  up a dance in the most luxurious attitudes Their dress was but half a covering the neck the left breast and all the limbs were exposed to view which after some time seemed rather to satiate than inflame desire The lily and the rose contended in forming their complexions and a soft sleepiness of eye added irresistible poignance to their charms but their beauties were obtruded not offered to their admirers they seemed to give rather than receive courtship and the genius of Love dismissed them as unworthy his regard since they exchanged the duties of love and made themselves not the pursued but the pursuing sex  "THE kingdom of Kashmire next produced its charming deputies This happy region seemed peculiarly sequestered by nature for his abode Shady mountains fenced it on one side from the scorching sun and seaborn breezes on the other gave peculiar luxuriance to the air Their complexions were of a bright yellow that appeared almost transparent while the crimson tulip seemed to blossom on their cheeks Their features and limbs were delicate beyond the statuary's power to express and their teeth  whiter than their own ivory He was almost persuaded to reside among them when unfortunately one of the ladies talked of appointing his seraglio"  "IN this procession the naked inhabitants of Southern America would not be left behind their charms were found to surpass whatever the warmest imagination could conceive and served to shew that beauty could be perfect even with the seeming disadvantage of a brown complexion But their savage education rendered them utterly unqualified to make the proper use of their power and they were rejected as being incapable of uniting mental with sensual satisfaction In this manner the deputies of other kingdoms had their suits rejected the black beauties of Benin and the tawny daughters of Borneo the women of Wida with scarred faces and the hideous virgins of Cafraria the squab ladies of Lapland three feet high and the giant fair ones of Patagonia  "THE beauties of Europe at last appeared grace was in their steps and sensibility sate smiling in every eye It was the universal opinion while they were approaching that  they would prevail and the genius seemed to lend them his most favourable attention They opened their pretensions with the utmost modesty but unfortunately as their orator proceeded she happened to let fall the words House in town Settlement and Pinmoney These seemingly harmless terms had instantly a surprising effect the genius with ungovernable rage burst from amidst the circle and waving his youthful pinions left this earth and flew back to those etherial mansions from whence he descended  "THE whole assembly was struck with amazement they now justly apprehended that female power would be no more since love had forsaken them They continued some time thus in a state of torpid despair when it was proposed by one of the number that since the real genius of Love had left them in order to continue their power they should set up an idol in his stead and that the ladies of every country should furnish him with what each liked best This proposal was instantly relished and agreed to An idol of gold was formed by uniting the capricious gifts of all the assembly though no way resembling the departed genius The  ladies of China furnished the monster with wings those of Kashmire supplied him with horns the dames of Europe clapped a purse in his hand and the virgins of Congo furnished him with a tail Since that time all the vows addressed to Love are in reality paid to the idol and as in other false religions the adoration seems most fervent where the heart is least sincere"  ESSAY XXIV  NO observation is more common and at the same time more true than That one half of the world are ignorant how the other half lives The misfortunes of the great are held up to engage our attention are enlarged upon in tones of declamation and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble sufferers the great under the pressure of calamity are conscious of several others sympathizing with their distress and have at once the comfort of admiration and pity  THERE is nothing magnanimous in bearing misfortunes with fortitude when the whole world is looking on men in such circumstances will act bravely even from motives of vanity but he who in the vale of obscurity can brave adversity who without friends to encourage acquaintances to pity or even without hope to alleviate his misfortunes can behave with tranquillity and indifference is truly great whether peasant or courtier he deserves admiration and should be held up for our imitation and respect  WHILE the slightest inconveniencies of the great are magnified into calamities while tragedy mouths out their sufferings in all the strains of eloquence the miseries of the poor are entirely disregarded and yet some of the lower ranks of people undergo more real hardships in one day than those of a more exalted station suffer in their whole lives It is inconceivable what difficulties the meanest of our common sailors and soldiers endure without murmuring or regret without passionately declaiming against Providence or calling their fellows to be gazers on their intrepidity Every day is to them a day of misery and yet they entertain their hard fate without repining  WITH what indignation do I hear an Ovid a Cicero or a Rabutin complain of their misfortunes and hardships whose greatest calamity was that of being unable to visit a certain spot of earth to which they had foolishly attached an idea of happiness Their distresses were pleasures compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day endure without murmuring They ate drank and slept they had slaves to attend them and were sure of subsistence for life while many of their fellowcreatures are obliged to wander without  a friend to comfort or assist them and even without a shelter from the severity of the season  I HAVE been led into these reflections from accidentally meeting some days ago a poor fellow whom I knew when a boy dressed in a sailor's jacket and begging at one of the outlets of the town with a wooden leg I knew him to be honest and industrious when in the country and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his present situation Wherefore after giving him what I thought proper I desired to know the history of his life and misfortunes and the manner in which he was reduced to his present distress The disabled soldier for such he was though dressed in a sailor's habit scratching his head and leaning on his crutch put himself into an attitude to comply with my request and gave me his history as follows  "AS for my misfortunes master I can't pretend to have gone thro' any more than other folks for except the loss of my limb and my being obliged to beg I don't know any reason thank Heaven that I have to complain there is Bill Tibbs of  our regiment he has lost both his legs an an eye to boot but thank Heaven it is not so bad with me yet  "I WAS born in Shropshire my father was a labourer and died when I was five years old so I was put upon the parish As he had been a wandering sort of a man the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish I belonged or where I was born so they sent me to another parish and that parish sent me to a third I thought in my heart they kept sending me about so long that they would not let me be born in any parish at all but at last however they fixed me I had some disposition to be a scholar and was resolved at least to know my letters but the master of the workhouse put me to business as soon as I was able to handle a mallet and here I lived an easy kind of a life for five years I only wrought ten hours in the day and had my meat and drink provided for my labour It is true I was not suffered to stir out of the house for fear as they said I should run away but what of that I had the liberty of the whole house and the yard before the door and that was enough for  me I was then bound out to a farmer where I was up both early and late but I ate and drank well and liked my business well enough till he died when I was obliged to provide for myself so I was resolved to go and seek my fortune  "IN this manner I went from town to town worked when I could get employment and starved when I could get none when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a justice of peace I spy'd a hare crossing the path just before me and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my stick at itWell what will you have on't I killed the hare and was bringing it away in triumph when the justice himself met me he called me a poacher and a villain and collaring me desired I would give an account of myself I fell upon my knees begged his worship's pardon and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed seed and generation but though I gave a very good account the justice would not believe a syllable I had to say so I was indicted at sessions found guilty of being poor and sent up to London to Newgate in order to be transported as a vagabond  "PEOPLE may say this and that of being in jail but for my part I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in all my life I had my belly full to eat and drink and did no work at all This kind of life was too good to last for ever so I was taken out of prison after five months put on board a ship and sent off with two hundred more to the plantations We had but an indifferent passage for being all confined in the hold more than a hundred of our people died for want of sweet air and those that remained were sickly enough God knows When we came ashore we were sold to the planters and I was bound for seven years more As I was no scholar for I did not know my letters I was obliged to work among the negroes and I served out my time as in duty bound to do  "WHEN my time was expired I worked my passage home and glad I was to see Old England again because I loved my country I was afraid however that I should be indicted for a vagabond once more so did not much care to go down into the country but kept about the town and did little jobbs when I could get them  "I WAS very happy in this manner for some time till one evening coming home from work two men knocked me down and then desired me to stand They belonged to a pressgang I was carried before the justice and as I could give no account of myself I had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war or list for a soldier I chose the latter and in this post of a gentleman I served two campaigns in Flanders was at the battles of Val and Fontenoy and received but one wound through the breast here but the doctor of our regiment soon made me well again  "WHEN the peace came on I was discharged and as I could not work because my wound was sometimes troublesome I listed for a landman in the EastIndia company's service I here fought the French in six pitched battles and I verily believe that if I could read or write our captain would have made me a corporal But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion for I soon fell sick and so got leave to return home again with forty pounds in my pocket This was at the beginning of the  present war and I hoped to be set on shore and to have the pleasure of spending my money but the government wanted men and so I was pressed for a sailor before ever I could set foot on shore  "THE boatswain found me as he said an obstinate fellow he swore he knew that I understood my business well but that I shammed Abraham merely to be idle but God knows I knew nothing of seabusiness and he beat me without considering what he was about I had still however my forty pounds and that was some comfort to me under every beating and the money I might have had to this day but that our ship was taken by the French and so I lost all  "OUR crew was carried into Brest and many of them died because they were not used to live in a jail but for my part it was nothing to me for I was seasoned One night as I was sleeping on the bed of boards with a warm blanket about me for I always loved to lie well I was awakened by the boatswain who had a dark lanthorn in his hand 'Jack' says he to me 'will you knock out the French centry's brains' I  don't care says I striving to keep myself awake if I lend a hand 'Then follow me' says he 'and I hope we shall do business' So up I got and tied my blanket which was all the cloaths I had about my middle and went with him to fight the Frenchmen I hate the French because they are all slaves and wear wooden Shoes  "THOUGH we had no arms one Englishman is able to beat five French at any time so we went down to the door where both the centries were posted and rushing upon them seized their arms in a moment and knocked them down From thence nine of us ran together to the quay and seizing the first boat we met got out of the harbour and put to sea We had not been here three days before we were taken up by the Dorset privateer who were glad of so many good hands and we consented to run our chance However we had not as much luck as we expected In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer of forty guns while we had but twentythree so to it we went yardarm and yardarm The fight lasted for three hours and I verily believe we should have taken the Frenchman had we but had some  more men left behind but unfortunately we lost all our men just as we were going to get the victory  "I WAS once more in the power of the French and I believe it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to Brest but by good fortune we were retaken by the Viper I had almost forgot to tell you that in that engagement I was wounded in two places I lost four fingers of the left hand and my leg was shot off If I had had the good fortune to have lost my leg and use of my hand on board a king's ship and not aboard a privateer I should have been entitled to cloathing and maintainance during the rest of my life but that was not my chance one man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth and another with a wooden ladle However blessed be God I enjoy good health and will for ever love liberty and Old England Liberty property and Old England for ever huzza  THUS saying he limped off leaving me in admiration at his intrepidity and content nor could I avoid acknowledging that an habitual acquaintance with misery serves better than philosophy to teach us to despise it  ESSAY XXV Supposed to be written by the Ordinary of Newgate  MAN is a most frail being incapable of directing his steps unacquainted with what is to happen in this life and perhaps no man is a more manifest instance of the truth of this maxim than Mr The Cibber just now gone out of the world Such a variety of turns of fortune yet such a persevering uniformity of conduct appears in all that happened in his short span that the whole may be looked upon as one regular confusion every action of his life was matter of wonder and surprize and his death was an astonishment  THIS gentleman was born of creditable parents who gave him a very good education and a great deal of good learning so that he could read and write before he was sixteen However he early discovered an inclination to follow  lewd courses he refused to take the advice of his parents and pursued the bent of his inclination he played at cards on Sundays called himself a gentleman fell out with his mother and laundress and even in these early days his father was frequently heard to observe that young Thewould be hanged  AS he advanced in years he grew more fond of pleasure would eat an ortolan for dinner though he begged the guinea that bought it and was once known to give three pounds for a plate of green pease which he had collected overnight as charity for a friend in distress he ran into debt with every body that would trust him and none could build a sconce better than he so that at last his creditors swore with one accord that Thewould be hanged  BUT as getting into debt by a man who had no visible means but impudence for subsistence is a thing that every reader is not acquainted with I must explain that point a little and that to his satisfaction  THERE are three ways of getting into debt first by pushing a face as thus  "You Mr  Lutestring send me home six yards of that paduasoy dammee but harkee don't think I ever intend to pay you for it dammee"  At this the mercer laughs heartily cuts off the paduasoy and sends it home nor is he till too late surprised to find the gentleman had said nothing but truth and kept his word  THE second method of running into debt is called sineering which is getting goods made up in such a fashion as to be unfit for every other purchaser and if the tradesman refuses to give them upon credit then threaten to leave them upon his hands  BUT the third and best method is called "Being the good customer" The gentleman first buys some trifle and pays for it in readymoney he comes a few days after with nothing about him but bank bills and buys we will suppose a sixpenny tweezercase the bills are too great to be changed so he promises to return punctually the day after and pay for what he has bought In this promise he is punctual and this is repeated for eight or ten times till his face is well known and he  has got at last the character of a good customer By this means he gets credit for something considerable and then never pays for it  IN all this the young man who is the unhappy subject of our present reflections was very expert and could face fineer and bring custom to a shop with any man in England none of his companions could exceed him in this and his very companions at last said that Thewould be hanged  AS he grew old he grew never the better he loved ortolans and green pease as before he drank gravysoup when he could get it and always thought his oysters tasted best when he got them for nothing or which was just the same when he bought them upon tick thus the old man kept up the vices of the youth and what he wanted in power he made up by inclination so that all the world thought that old Thewould be hanged  AND now reader I have brought him to his last scene a scene were perhaps my duty should have obliged me to assist You expect perhaps his dying words and the tender farewell  he took of his wife and children you expect an account of his coffin and white gloves his pious ejaculations and the papers he left behind him In this I cannot indulge your curiosity for oh the mysteries of fate The was drown'd  "READER" as Hervey saith "pause and ponder and ponder and pause who knows what thy own end may be  ESSAY XXVI THE DOUBLE TRANSFORMATION A TALE  SECLUDED from domestic strife  Jack Bookworm liv'd a college life  A fellowship at twentyfive  Made him the happiest man alive  He drank his glass and crack'd his joke  And Freshmen wonder'd as he spoke  Without politeness aim'd at breeding  And laugh'd at pedantry and reading  SUCH pleasures unallay'd with care  Could any accident impair  Could Cupid's shaft at length transfix  Our swain arriv'd at thirtysix  O had the archer ne'er come down  To ravage in a country town  Or Flavia been content to stop  At triumphs in a Fleetstreet shop  O had her eyes forgot to blaze  Or Jack had wanted eyes to gaze  OBut let exclamation cease  Her presence banish'd all his peace  OUR alter'd Parson now began  To be a perfect ladies man  Made sonnets lisp'd his sermons o'er  And told the tales he told before  Of bailiffs pump'd and proctors bit  At college how he shew'd his wit  And as the fair one still approv'd  He fell in loveor thought he lov'd  So with decorum all things carry'd  Miss frown'd and blush'd and then was married  NEED we expose to vulgar sight  The raptures of the bridal night  Need we intrude on hallow'd ground  Or draw the curtains clos'd around  Let it  uffice that each had charms  He clasp'd a goddess in his arms  And tho' she felt his visage rough  Yet in a man 'twas well enough  THE honeymoon like light'ning flew  The second brought its transports too  A third a fourth were not amiss  The fifth was friendship mix'd with bliss  But when a twelvemonth pass'd away  Jack found his goddess made of clay  Found half the charms that deck'd her face  Arose from powder shreds or lace  But still the worst remain'd behind  That very face had robb'd her mind  SKILL'd in no other arts was she  But dressing patching repartee  And just as humour rose or fell  By turns a slattern or a belle  'Tis true she dress'd with modern grace  Half naked at a ball or race  But when at home at board or bed  Five greasy nightcaps wrap'd her head  Could so much beauty condescend  To be a dull domestic friend  Could any curtainlectures bring  To decency so fine a thing  In short by night 'twas fits or fretting  By day 'twas gadding or coquetting  NOW tawdry madam kept a bevy  Of powder'd coxcombs at her levy  The 'squire and captain took their stations  And twenty other near relations  Jack suck'd his pipe and often broke  A sigh in suffocating smoke  She in her turn became perplexing  And found substantial bliss in vexing  Thus every hour was pass'd between  Insulting repartee or spleen  Each day the more her faults were known  He thinks her features coarser grown  He fancies every vice she shews  Or thins her lip or points her nose  Whenever rage or envy rise  How wide her mouth how wild her eyes  He knows not how but so it is  Her face is grown a knowing phyz  And tho' her fops are wond'rous civil  He thinks her ugly as the devil  THUS to perplex the ravell'd nooze  While each a different way pursues  While sullen or loquacious strife  Promis'd to hold them on for life  That dire disease whose ruthless power  Withers the beauty's transient flower  Lo the smallpox whose horrid glare  Levell'd its terrors at the fair  And rifling ev'ry youthful grace  Left but the remnant of a face  THE glass grown hateful to her sight  Reflected now a perfect fright  Each former art she vainly tries  To bring back lustre to her eyes  In vain she tries her pastes and creams  To smooth her skin or hide its seams  Her country beaux and city cousins  Lovers no more flew off by dozens  The squire himself was seen to yield  And even the captain quit the field  Poor Madam now condemn'd to hack  The rest of life with anxious Jack  Perceiving others fairly flown  Attempted pleasing him alone  Jack soon was dazzl'd to behold  Her present face surpass the old  With modesty her cheeks are dy'd  Humility displaces pride  For tawdry finery is seen  A person ever neatly clean  No more presuming on her sway  She learns good nature every day  Serenely gay and strict in duty  Jack finds his wife a perfect beauty  ESSAY XXVII A NEW SIMILE IN THE MANNER OF SWIFT  I Long had rack'd my brains to find  A likeness for the scribbling kind  The modern scribbling kind who write  In wit and sense and nature's spite  'Till reading I forget what day on  A chapter out of Took's Pantheon  I think I met with something there  To suit my purpose to a hair  But let us not proceed too furious  First please to turn to God Mercurius  You'll find him pictured at full length  In book the second page the tenth  The stress of all my proofs on him I lay  And now proceed we to our simile  Imprimis pray observe his hat  Wings upon either sidemark that  Well what is it from thence we gather  Why these denote a brain of feather  A brain of feather very right  With wit that's flighty learning light  Such as to modern bard's decreed  A just comparisonproceed  In the next place his feet peruse  Wings grow again from both his shoes  Design'd no doubt their part to bear  And waft his godship through the air  And here my simile unites  For in a modern poet's flights  I'm sure it may be justly said  His feet are useful as his head  Lastly vouchsafe t' observe his hand  Fill'd with a snake incircled wand  By classic authors term'd caducis  And highly fam'd for several uses  To witmost wond'rously endu'd  No poppy water half so good  For let folks only get a touch  It's soporific virtue's such  Tho' ne'er so much awake before  That quickly they begin to snore  Add too what certain writers tell  With this he drives men's souls to hell  Now to apply begin we then  His wand's a modern author's pen  The serpents round about it twin'd  Denote him of the reptile kind  Denote the rage with which he writes  His frothy slaver venom'd bites  An equal semblance still to keep  Alike to both conduce to sleep  This diff'rence only as the God  Drove soul's to Tart'rus with his rod  With his goosequill the scribbling elf  Instead of others damns himself  And here my simile almost tript  Yet grant a word by way of postscript  Moreover Merc'ry had a failing  Well what of that out with itstealing  In which our scribling bards agree  Being each as great a thief as he  But ev'n this deities' existence  Shall lend my simile assistance  Our modern bards why what a pox  Are they but senseless stones and blocks  * J B  FINIS
