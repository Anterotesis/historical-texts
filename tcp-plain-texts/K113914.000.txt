publication and a variety of other concurrent circumstancesthe whole of the subscribers' names were not received in time to  extend  the number of this impression which from the uncertainty of what might be its reception I have to lament was fixed  ab origine  at  six hundred  The following list contains names for five hundred and fiftyseven copiesthe remainder of the impression I mean to take with me to INDIAwhich I flatter myself will not be deemed an offence by those who have subscribed and cannot be supplied as it will be impossible my engagements being already made to wait for the second edition though it is already begun  It would be departing from every principle I have professed to consider the overplus subscriberswho I am proud to notice already amount to nearly two hundredas  chance customers  it would be as unfair not to act upon the plan of  first come first served  those ladies and gentlemen thereforemany of whose names have been procured through the

that no man ought to obtrude himself unnecessarily on the publicbut when chance has thrown in the way of even the meanest individual occasion to remark on a variety of matters that lead to such information as may afford general or particular instruction and amusement I know no reason why such a labour should not aspire to popular notice  Upon this principleI address to the best judge I know of all general subjects whether natural or acquired my MUSICAL TOUR In which I have had opportunity at different times to laugh to deplore to pity and applaudit has excited in some instances my astonishment in others my indifference it has called forth my warmest gratitude and moved my ineffable contempt  The provocation of these different feelings of course had its rise from my different public and individual reception I have been lost in admiration  at the benignant liberality of one man in power and obliged to shelter myself under a sort of contemptuous compassion at the ignorant importance of another I have been charmed to wonder at professional candour and I have smiled unmoved at professional envy I have warmed to delight at instances of private friendship and have beheld with unhappiness and forgiven wanton attempts to do me private injuries  As for my public reception it has been flattering in the extreme as far as it relates to applause I wish I could say the same as to profit One advantage I have certainly reaped from itmy country experience has given me a more competent view of popular opinion than all I had before done I believe it may be owing to my having conversed with my audience and taken them at the moment I made them feel Among the number however who have attended me I shall not easily forget the few who are firmly convinced I am a most impudent impostorfor that Mr DIBDIN amassed so large a fortune by the  Padlock  and the  Jubilee  For the truth of this matter see the statement of my profits for dramatic pieces  as to be perfectly independent whereas I stroll about the country that I am a stout jolly young man in my own hair whereas Mr DIBDIN is a tall thin man and wears a wig  Nothing can be more curious than popular prejudices I know a clergyman who having enjoyed for several years the world's good opinion was turned off through a ridiculous pique by a young nobleman to whom he was preceptor After his disgrace every vice and folly that could taint a man's character was attributed to him He drank wenched and was so complete a gambler that had he kept his old situation much longer he would have ruined the principles of his pupil I know him welland am convinced he is free from all these vices and in particular as to playI declare I once saw him in a single game at whist  revoke five times  On this subject I have a large stock of Anecdotes which you will get in their place  This TOUR also will as far as opportunity has permitted me give the public some useful hints relative to inns manufactories natural and artificial curiosities the state of the country as to cultivation and such other particulars as have cursorily struck meand really Mr PATERSON ought to subscribe  handsomelyfor I shall be able to improve his road book which in some instances is very erroneous Having also had many opportunities of conversing with men of genius I shall communicate my remarks on those conversations in which in particular will be comprised my sentiments on MUSIC in all its points of view for to tell you a secret while I merely considered myself as a public man I held up disdain as a shield to ward off the shafts of envy and conceived myself under no obligation to blunt that malignity which neither gave me pain nor injured me in the opinions of the candid and liberal Having however made my election to cramp myself no more in the trammels of public drudgery I mean without favour or affection honestly to point out that music neither is nor ought to be what it is represented that a knowledge of it sufficiently competent for all common purposes is to be easily attained and in short to shew the world how to beware of counterfeits for such are abroadand as I pledge myself to do this fully and fairly I have no fear of succeeding to the discomfiture of all such as have maintained that I am no musician that I do not know the nature of harmony a single method in modulation or a rule in composition Another object which peculiarly demands my attention is the THEATRE Nor will a fair exposition of its arcana come by any means improperly through the medium of this publication An account of the motives which induce me to quit my native country are a part of my compact with the public and they cannot be enumerated without relating many theatrical transactionsbesides a recent correspondence with Mr HARRIS actually comes within the meaning of the TOUR and as I consider myself under an examinationand what ought to be serious indeed a selfexaminationwould it not be unpardonable to conceal any part of the truth which for my comfort will infallibly be credited because ceasing to be a public man I cannot be supposed to have any interest in what I do  These matters together with a prodigious number of observations both of my own and others on all general subjectsanecdotes and the essence of what I have delivered at different places under the title of READINGS and  MUSIC will make up a series of letters which as they are to contain the remarks of a man long in the habit of administering to the pleasure of the public will I trust with the advantage of your sentiments on each separate letter be found to excite and satisfy public curiosity Thus you see like Othello I could take a hintno sooner had you signified a wish that I should address these letters to you than I plumed myself upon that opportunity of introducing them eligibly to the world and I hope you will sustain no disgrace in this liberty taken by  Dear Sir  Yours c C DIBDIN  Hereford    August    LETTER II  ENCOURAGEMENT TO PROCEED  "  Give me a man that is not passion's slave and I'll wear him in my heart's core  "  To T S Esq  DEAR SIR  I cannot have a stronger stimulative to proceed than your kindness The praise you are pleased to afford my introductory letterwhich cannot from its nature be so entertaining as those of which it is the harbingergives me very flattering hopes that this testimony of public gratitude will hold some rank in the world's estimation Be assured it shall be written with the most rigid integrity and I think it will create some interest You are so kind to say  "that you really think a series of such letters would take and though much depends on popular caprice and momentary taste for which there is no accounting yet you must encourage me to proceedfor it is a musical age and an  annus mirabilis  of anecdote"  Under the auspices of a generous public assisted by the advice of a warm and experienced advocate I shall fearlessly go through my task assured while I address myself to you my  feelings  will meet every indulgence from the  kind friend  and my FAME every advantage from the ABLE CRITIC  I am c C DIBDIN  Sheffield    October    LETTER III  WRITTEN TO PROVE THAT PROFIT IS A BETTER THING THAN FAME  "  Who would fardels bear  "  And sweat and groan under a load of life  "  To T S Esq  DEAR SIR  A measure without a motive is a superstructure without a foundation There has been as much speculation on my becoming an itinerant as might in France have procured me the honour of a  lettre de cachet  Vainly I say at the bottom of my bills that having received a long and liberal patronage from the public I come to thank that body for having amply requited my services Say the cavillers  'your argument makes against you Had you drawn so much money as you report the present measure would not have been worth your while and if you are such a favourite why not continue in a service that has procured you such reputation'  Some few I have set right in these particularsthe rest are referred to this very letter which shall  "a round unvarnished tale unfold"  First thenI certainly have received more public applause than any English composer except ARNE nor was it least when I could boast of that glorious competitor's friendship Can any other than myself count upwards of ninety songs of his own composition that have been encored and yet I never in my life wrote a single puff on my own accountbut on the contrary constantly reprobated that contemptible support of imbecility and rotten prop  of debilitated reputation Out of nearly sixty pieces which I have written and composed and which before I have done I will enumerate no one has been actually damnedthree only have been withdrawn  The Shepherdess of the Alps  which was miserably performed  The Chelsea Pensioner  which was actually so successful as to have four songs encored on the last night it was representedand  Amphytrion  which I was compelled to write on a plan I never approved Many of the remainder have been performed more than thirty nights some more than sixty in the first seasonnot to mention those which constantly keep the stage and are favourites all over the kingdom and yet among these I have not included the  Padlock  the  Jubilee  nor any of those pieces which though composed by me are not of my writing A reception like this is evidently a liberal one and must have brought an immense sum of moneybut to whom To the managers of the theatrewho have constantly the oyster while the poet and composer divide the shells Thus uniting both those characters in myself I have been encumbered with two shells instead of onefor fame after all like a theatrical banquet though very  fine  is not EATABLE These reasons which I trust bear no marks of vanity since they are plain facts and I offer them only in my vindication will shew that though I have been handsomely paid yet it has been in a coin advantageous to no other being than a camelion and as I am no air eater but on the contrary love as well as any body the good things of this world my intention is certainly to go where I am informed they are to be found  Thus you see I have made the matter fairly demonstrable without the smallest depreciation of the public liberality  They  gave the money and  I  the pleasure and therefore I have not the least doubt but they had rather I had received the profit  NeverthelessI should have made the best of these bad bargains and jogged on in the old way had it not been evident that my unfortunate connection with the Circus barred the doors of the theatreor rather left them  a little open that they might squeeze me the harder I have had no piece since  Amphytrion  but  Liberty Hall  which after having  nine  songs encored the FIRST night six of which were repeated and the other three excused out of compassion to the performers was  hissed by a party  on the  tenth  and immediately withdrawn This cannot possibly be attributable to Mr LINLEYfor though eleven years ago  This circumstance deserves to be told I had certainly no expectation at  Drurylane  after GARRICK retired from it Poor BRERETON however to whom Mr SHERIDAN was under obligations wishing me to remain at the theatre made his friend promise that I should return to my old situation As Mr BRERETON is dead I should not venture to assert this as a positive fact had not Mr SHERIDAN confessed he had made such a promise not however without saying he was sorry for it as he was sure my being at  Drurylane  would cause a heartburning between Mr LINLEY and me He had nevertheless he said done something that would answer the purpose as wellhaving prevailed with Mr HARRIS to engage me as composer to  Covent Garden  At his desire I called on Mr HARRIS who assured me and I sincerely believe him that he had never  any conversation  WHATEVER on the subject His words were  "surely Mr SHERIDAN's mad"  No engagement of course took place and I went to FranceWhile I am on this subject I shall mention that there are moments when mean men are ashamed of their own littleness At my return from France I made a verbal engagement with Mr HARRIS to the exclusion of all others as composer to the house Let it be remembered I do not say this to accuse him of inconsistencyit was certainly his intention not to have a composer till the business of  Poor Vulcan  induced him to alter his mind It was at this time the theatrical coalition had taken place and Mr HARRIS and his colleague were never asunder One morning I came to a rehearsal rather before the time and found these gentlemen talking on the stage Mr HARRIS to whom I had that morning sent the hunting song beginning  "give round the word dismount dismount"  came to me very eagerly to thank me for my expedition in getting it ready Mr SHERIDAN who could not avoid seeing me seemed not to know me We talked a good while on different subjects during which time to do his modesty justice with all his consummate eloquence he knew not what to say At length finding he must speak to me he called Mr HARRIS aside and asked him who I wasand being informed he came up to me to make an apology for as he said not knowing me I might be altered but so was hefor when I before saw him he was as remarkably spruce as at the time I mention he was remarkably slovenly Said he  "Mr DIBDIN I beg your pardon a thousand timesI had not the smallest recollection of you I don't know how it isbutyou are strangely altered You had no powder in your hair when I last saw you"  'Faith then'  said I  ''twould have been no wonder if I had not known you for when last I saw you  you had  '  'But'  said I to Mr HARRIS  ''tis not wonderful Mr SHERIDAN should not chuse to know mefor the last time I saw him was when he sent me on that fool's errand  to you  '  Mr SHERIDAN excused himself from keeping  a promise he had made of giving me the situation of composer to the house which I had seven years held under Mr GARRICK by telling me that a connection with  Drurylane  would certainly cause a heartburningthough in the affair of  Liberty Hall  Mr LINLEY protracted the benefit till it was no benefit at allthough Mr LINLEY positively accused a friend of mine as the author of the above supererogate damnation which friend has given me many strong and unequivocal proofs that he is no dealer in words onlythough I had the honour of kicking my heels in Mr LINLEY's hall about thirty times in one season concerning a farce which was cursorily read liked revised and at length returned through the medium of the under prompterwhich farce by way of parenthesis I afterwards sent to Mr HARRIS who returned it writing me word I had better get it performed at  Drurylane  though notwithstanding all this I since sent two pieces to Mr LINLEY which were returned  unread  and lastly though Mr LINLEY to put the matter upon a footing wrote me a letter saying they did not want  my talents  at  Drurylane  yet Mr LINLEY's character as a fair candid honest man free from littleness and above all  envy  his diffidence of his own merit which he has often confessed to me did not at all qualify him for dramatic compositionsin short his amiable private virtues his wonderful public abilities which are so real that they are ten times over repeated almost every day in almost every newspaper All these abundantly prove that the aboverelated circumstances though selfevident have somehow or other like a sham flaw in a good indictment a sort of apparent defection and can by specious and ingenious arguments which are a great deal better because more fashionable than plain truth and common sense be made to quash the charge and not only shew the accused immaculately innocent but grossly injured But to drop all pleasantryare not these fardels of the mind and if soare they not incomparably more galling and ponderous than those of the body Mine however will always be relieved by the reflection that I have a friend like you and the pleasure I take in assuring you that I am unfeignedly yours  C DIBDIN  York    Sept    LETTER IV  MORE REASONS FOR PREFERRING THE SUBSTANCE TO THE SHADOW  "  Nothing extenuate  "  Nor set down ought in malice  "  To T S Esq  DEAR SIR  AS Tristram Shandy was a long while employed on writing his history before he was born so I shall be some time getting on with my MUSICAL TOUR before I set out My motive which I talked of in the last letter is like a quantity of vivid quicksilver which being touched separates into a number of smaller globules These in order to go on with precision it must be my task to sweep again into the original massor to speak less circularlyit will be proper to touch on all that train of subordinate events which induced me to muster up the  absolutely  necessary resolution of roving into foreign parts To do this without a retrogade motion for I hate every thing ungraceful I shall not go regularly back but at once skip to that period when in consequence of a difference of opinion with Mr HARRIS about the mode of altering  Amphytrion  which being done his way was as I predicted performed without successthat gentleman and I separated At that time I applied to a friend of mine to enter into some scheme with me who prevailed on several other gentlemen to join him in building the Circus The history of that placethe infamy of its present occupierthe blindness of the Surry magistratesthe ill treatment of the proprietorsand my incorrigible  weakness and folly in tamely suffering so many impositions would make up matter for a much larger work than this I am writingbut as I will not pay your patience so ill a compliment as to require that you should rake in a jakes and as also I mean in my public decease to die in peace with all men I shall only say that having laboured four times more during three years than any other man ever did I found I had nothing for it but to regain the theatres This was certainly a forlorn hope and I struggled with it as long as I could In particular I had the pleasure of kicking down about l by building a castle in the air near Pancras by virtue of an agreement with the famousI had almost added another syllableJACOB LEROUX Esq architect brickmaker and tradingjustice in the district of Clerkenwell This gentleman with a dastardly speciousness for which a Hyena might envy him promised me a license in the name of several magistrates  who opposed the motion  and knowing I suppose the actual value of the protestations he had made erected the skeleton of a building which was blown down by the first high wind after the licence was refused  Foiled thus in every attempt at independancy I did my utmost to get reconnected with the theatres but to no purpose One manoeuvre which I practised to accomplish this deserves notice I got a friend to present a comedy to  Drurylane  without naming the author who had so much interest that Mr SHERIDAN himself read about half a dozen pages and praised them The rest of the piece was read by Mrs SHERIDAN who liked it very much It was then referred to Mr TICKEL who referred it to Mrs TICKEL who read and approved it After this Mr TICKEL pronounced that with a few alterations it would do and something was in agitation though never completed concerning an accommodation for l till the piece should make its appearance My friend is since gone abroadand seeing I had nothing else for it I wrote to Mr TICKEL setting him right concerning the author of the comedy and desiring to have it returned Though I took a great deal of pains to get an answer to the letter I have never yet received one and the piece of  course remains in their hands As I shall certainly throughout the whole of this work be very tenacious of advancing what I do not positively and from my own conviction know to be fact I shall remark upon the abovethat as I had no communication whatever with Mr TICKEL concerning this same comedy I could come at what I have related through my friend's account only I have a pretty strong  presumptive  proof however that it is literally true for during the transaction to clench the business which the readers see it did with a vengeance a near relation of Mr TICKEL had a curacy given him of two livings not an hundred miles from  Bedford  by the very gentleman who presented the comedy Another friend in the same manner sent an afterpiece to Mr HARRIS who returned it saying  "though it had great theatrical merit it would not do on the stage"  Hear this ye wouldbewitlings and rejoice theatrical merit is no longer a dramatic requisite This piece is now in the hands of Mr COLMAN who by agreement was to have performed it during his late seasonbut whether he did not wish to risque the principal character with any body but Mr PALMER which is the reason he assigned to me adding that the piece was so well written it deserved good actors for that it was in the style of the  Guardian  but more delicateor whether he was shocked at the cruel and inhuman murder of  Harvest Home  See the statement of pieces  or in short whatever may be his reasons it still lies in his hands I even to leave nothing untried made an agreement with Mr DALY the Irish manager which after being broken on his side three times yielded me in three years about lwhereas had it been properly kept I must have received six times that sum  Finding myself therefore in the state of ADAM with all the world before me where to chusefor I have pretty well proved that the theatrical paradise was shut against meit struck me that the warm and fostering climate of ASIA might revive a drooping plant that had been neglected in its native soil but then as Mr BAYS says came in the  Quomodo  how to procure the ways and means I had never travelled much in  England  and I thought it would be no bad thing  to pay my personal respects to my old patrons to thank them for their liberality and at the same time present them with such an entertainment as should not only insure me their good wishes and interest them for my prosperity but supply me with the means to accomplish my design  Determined however to make sure of every thing in my power I wrote to Mr HARRIS telling him my intention and offering to sale such materials as I conceived might be useful to him I received a letter encouraging me to furnish him with pieces of any description and I have actually from that time to this at my leisure been hard at work for him  But I know not how it ismy mind misgives me on this subject I have since seen Mr HARRIS at BRISTOL and heard from him at YORK However I shall anticipate nothingall matters shall come in their proper orderand if you have the patience I wish youfor patience you must have if you jog on with me through my TOURindeed if I was to follow the examples of some musical travellers I should exercise no other virtue in youyou will permit me to place the banquet I have invited you to in what manner I please Interest forbid having such work for my own imagination I should not leave the reader as much room as possible for the workings of his It has been affirmed that the pleasures we fancy are completer than those we enjoy and if this position be founded who knows but by constantly keeping curiosity on tiptoe I shall receive credit for having furnished a good feast even though half the merit lay in exciting the appetite There is more art say the painters in concealing than shewing Would any one read an epigram if the last line were taken away Not to gratify would be to to make a TANTALUS of the reader but still let us remember that  possession  easily attained is but another word for SATIETY  Thus having by a regular gradation with a few shirts and books in a trunk a welldigested plan in my head and a letter from Dr ARNOLD to Dr  HAYES in my pocket seated myself in the Oxford stagecoach my next letter will of course contain what happened to me at that  confusion of tongues  In the prosecution of which as well as of all the rest of my adventures though no more than OTHELLO would I have any thing extenuated or ought set down in malice yet like DICK in  The Miller of Mansfield  I shall certainly speak  truth  and if that happens to be SATIRE I cannot help ityet never shall I say truer than when I assure you  I am With perfect sincerity Yours C DIBDIN  York    September    LETTER V  CONTAINING A JOURNEY TO OXFORDWITH A DESCRIPTION OF A MUSICIAN WITH GOOD SENSE AND A CLERGYMAN WITHOUT PRIDE  "  Yet I am honestthough I wear black  "  To T S Esq  DEAR SIR  IT was not in the dull month of November when Englishmen hang and drown themselves but in the sprightly month of March when they rouse from their lethargy when citizens and tomtits begin to inhale the bracing influence of the eastern breeze and ponies and countrylodgings are smartened up for customers You who are perfectly correctly critically erudite will not surely blame me for being particular as to dates Some readers remember nothing but the chronological parts and it does not signify threepence by what means this Queen happened to be ravished or that Emperor flayed alive so that they can give a faithful account of the time such an event took place Mr SHERIDAN marks the time in the commencement of his  Duenna  by making the clock strike four though he ridicules that very circumstanceforgetting of course that he had used itin  The Critic  On the seventeenth of March I left  the regions of smoke  for the  regions of accomplishment  Nothing passed on the road worthy your notice The conversation of the passengers in the stagecoach was in the usual stile Almost every object brought with it some remark We admired as usual the entrance of  SionHouse  the convenient situation for stargazing of Mr HERSCHELwe  sighed as usual to think on human depravity on contemplating the gibbets upon HounslowHeath and we lamented their fate who were poisoned at SaltHill The very dinner was as usualsome soup which might have been mistaken for a dose of salts relished with leeks and a boiled leg of mutton scarcely warmed through At length the majestic view of lofty steeples towers and turrets demanded our admirationand we presently arrived at Oxford  The next morning I called on Dr HAYES If you have never seen this gentleman I must tell you that he is the very kind of man that of all others interests you strongly in his favour the moment you speak to him I believe no human creature ever possessed a better or a more blameless heart and never was a countenance more the index of a mind for whatever fancy can picture of benevolence mildness and benignity is written there in characters so legible that they cannot be mistaken If he should see this portrait of himself and from his diffidence wish I had blotted it out let him forgive me in the reflection that I am only ambitious to do him that justice which he has so much pleasure in rendering to all mankind Nayyou shall yourself confess I am not a flattering painter Can you tell me my dear Sir a character so near perfection as he who a professor himself knows not  professional envy  This man then is Dr HAYESand he is so very different from JOSEPH SURFACE that all the world speaks  well of him  and yet all the world speaks TRUTH  After we had talked over my business in the course of which conversation I told him that I had a very strong wish to start my entertainment at the University to give it a proper sanction he referred me to THE VICE CHANCELLOR and gave me an introductory letter I asked him if Dr CHAPMAN was easy of access and he told me I should find him the most chearful amiable man I had ever conversed with This report was so true that I must try my hand at another description  THE VICE CHANCELLOR OF OXFORD is a tall wellmade man with all the easy grace and native simplicity of a plain country gentlemanand yet a demeanour that might shame a courtier His eye is so piercing that it seems to penetrate your very intentionsand yet so mild that it is easy to discern his only solicitation is to know your wants and supply them His conversation is as simpleyet as elegant as SWIFT's  Drapier's Letters  His discernment remarkably acute and his discrimination precision itself This gentleman if he should so far honour me as to read this book may wonder how I can venture to affirm so much from the little opportunity I had of conversing with him but I will be ingenuous enough to declare that I went to him predetermined to make my observationsand those observations went not more to any other part of his conduct than his invincible integrityof which as well as the rest you shall judge  I must premise however I would not declare what passed between us could I for a moment suppose it would create the most distant chance of belief in the breast of any young gentlemen of the University that Dr CHAPMAN is not as anxious to give them pleasure as they to receive it He certainly debarred them at that time of what they afterwards did me the kindness to consider as a very high gratification I told him the nature of my entertainment and his words were these  "I am very sorry I must refuse you my consent Your professional abilities deserve a different answer and I dare say you would perform nothing that could discredit either yourself or the Universitybut I am at this moment particularly circumstanced There have been lately many riots and though I am very desirous of pleasing the students they sometimes put it out of my power Here was a Mr COLLINS and I could not with propriety let him perform He went awayand the young gentlemen took the matter so much in dudgeon that they encouraged some Italians to sing here without my permission I was in consequence under the painful  necessity of sending them to prison  The riotous conduct of the students upon this occasion went so far that one of them struck the mayor and it was expected at the time I was there that a sentence of expulsion would pass against him at the end of the term  and it is more than probable were I now to tell youwhich I wish I couldMr DIBDIN you may perform your entertainmentthey might think I set you up against their favourite Italians and it might turn out a serious quarrelfor in such a case your professional reputation would be of no availand they would resent in their anger what in a cooler moment they might be convinced they had reason to thank me for"  Nothing could be handsomer than this reasoning I felt myself so influenced by it that I was more pleased at such a refusal than I should have been by an unconditional permission This gentleman took a great deal of pains to prove himself right in a matter wherein had he been so minded he had nothing to exercise but an  ipse dixit  The discharge of his duty as  vice chancellor  did not satisfy himhe chose to discharge it as  a man  In fine as he saw nothing that he could disapprove in the nature of my entertainment he could not bear that I should come to Oxford for nothing and thinking very probably that his apparent refusal might be of public disadvantage to me he gave me his word that I should perform my amusement in the following term Thus I took leave of Dr CHAPMAN a character were it more imitated by the  clergy  religion would be more revered by the  laity  To prove however that I have no further interest in what I have said above than that fair and candid justice I am determined to do every man I mention in this series of letters I declare I did not put ten guineas in my pocket by my performance at OXFORD on my returnand I neglected what would have been a considerably greater advantage to me I can therefore have no other reason for what I here advance than a regard for truth unbiassed by any servile  motive and as that shall honestly actuate me upon all occasions you will by and by get the portrait of another vice chancellor who had his  motives  for refusing me toobut they were not exactly of the same complexion as Dr CHAPMAN's In short PLUTARCH compared the  paralleled  virtues of his heroesMINE will be all  contrast  And though I will not suppose but that all characters are honest who wear black yet it will be readily granted me there are shades of that colour even from the dismal dingy first mourning of an heir to the light airy Frenchgrey in which he takes possession of his father's titles and estate  Adieu Hey for BATHwhere you will find me in my next letter  I am Dear Sir Yours c C DIBDIN  York    October    LETTER VI  A DESCRIPTION OF BATH AND A TOLERABLE INSTANCE OF MODEST ASSURANCE  "  He speaks more in an hour  "  Than he'll stand to in a year  "  To T S Esq  DEAR SIR  ON Sunday March I arrived at that mixture of lowliness and grandeur pride and meanness politeness and impertinenceBATHthe region of fashion and dullnessof elegance and vapidityof public reputation and private intrigueof extravagance and imposition Where dress is the  ne plus ultra  of all virtuewhere a graceful minuet is considered as the height of human perfectionwhere goodbreeding is carried to such a pitch of refinement that doves and rooks mix  sans façon  and the foxes and geese are all of one familywhere the buildings like the visitors are grand heavy and smokedriedwhere Irish gentlemen of high families and low fortunes lay in wait for opportunities to amuse those misses who pass their whole time in contriving how they shall most conveniently leave sick mamma to the care of the old nurseand where convivial lords who have worn out the cellar the larder the waiters and themselves in London are wheeled down with about six months to live to drink the waters hobble cotillions pick their teeth qualify Burgundy with spruce beer faintly revive expiring nature by the administration of stimulatives beat false time scream bravo  mal apropos  and hiccup out  non nobis domine  Herefor Fortune so willed itwas I to make my  coup d'essai  and having fixed myself in a lodging I began to prepare for my entertainment which I advertised for the following Tuesday Wednesday and Friday On the Monday morning came a loud rap at my parlour door I called  "Come in"  and a genteel well looking man entered the room within what they call the singing or fashionable brogue  'Sir your most obedient humble servant I understand you are Mr DIBDIN whom all the world knowsthe composer of  The Padlock  and  The Jubilee  and  Poor Vulcan  and  The Quaker  and all those charming pieces that 'tis a long time we have been delighted with Oh by my soul I do tink that beautiful songstay a minutewhich is it Ah fait its no matteryou never made a bad one in your life Well Sir don't let me interrupt you I take the liberty of callingfor you see I am distractedly fond of music and I find we are going to be charmed with a little entertainment of your fabricating Sir I have it in my power to do you a great deal of service and to be sure I shall conceive it the duty of myself and every other friend I have to be as stirring as possible in this business I know already of a party of fourteen that I have not spoken to And den there isOh fait there are some very capital families heredon't be uneasypray could you favour me with some little delicate charming beautiful touchonly just you know to make their mouths water by telling them what I have heard'  I was at the  Piano Forte  and complied with great readiness and indeed as much as any thing to know the drift of this long harrangue which I shrewdly suspected implied something more than mere spontaneous good nature After I had donehe cried  'ah by my soulthere's no other man alive but yourself wid such taste Well now I'll tell you somethingwhere do you perform'  I answered  "at the newrooms"  'Well but sure there won't be room enough for the people they'll come in such crowdsbut that is not what I am going to saydo you know you have it in your power to do me the greatest favour in the world'  "I am sure then Sir I have it in my inclination"  'Ah now that's what I have always saidtrue genius and politeness constantly go hand in hand together Sir I thank  you very kindly You must know there is a lady in this town of great distinctionone of the first Irish familiesthe honourable Mrs O'N She is at the head of fifteen thousand a year and writes poetry like an angelOh to be sure I have not the sweetest song of her writinghere it isyou shall read it'  He then produced me the first stanza of a song certainly very prettily written  'Now do you see I entreat this may be a secret between you and I'  and so very Irish was this request that MATHEWS of BATH to whom I had been playing the songs of  Harvest Home  was in the room from first to last  'what do you tink I have promisedyou must know I have a pretty notion of music and I play tolerably well for a gentleman on the violinI have promised to set this sweet song to music and for the life of me I don't know hownow you seeyou would do it it in three minutesI can say it's mineand as we shall keep the secret nobody can know any tink about it What do you tink of thisyou know I shall make some large parties for youoh by my soul you may depend through my means of having a thick audience Well Sir if you will be so very kind as to do me this great favour I shall have a very singular and particular pleasureand in return exclusive of the attention I mean to pay your performance which indeed is but the duty of every man who is a lover and encourager of professional meritI shall certainly serve you any way within the scope of my interest and ability'  Not to tire youI set the song promising like the PRINCE OF WALES about the death of HOTSPUR that if a lie would do him grace I'd dress it in the finest terms I had The captain was in rapturespromised me to bring ALL BATHand then came  alone  I met him afterwards at the catch club where he made no sort of apology for his breach of promise but carelessly said that Mrs O'N was charmed with the songthat he felt himself very gay in his borrowed plumesthat he was sorry I had such a bad roomthat it would do my heart good to hear them sing catches and glees in Ireland where he should be very happy to have the pleasure of seeing meand in short resorted to such paltry subterfuges as induced me to pity him for a contemptible ingenuity which I dare say he thought merited praise  Determined however by an honest manoeuvre to repay his nefarious oneI gave the song to Mr INCLEDON who sings it charmingly at Vauxhall and it is now printed with my name to the music in the title page The negroes with that shrewdness for which they are remarkable call a promise  windy  At a place called DEEP BAY in ST KITT's the young men are remarkable for taking advantage of the credulity of the negro girls One of the poor creatures who had been abused and forsaken complained to her brother Honest QUAMINO answered  "Sissy I always say you dam foolfor what you go DEEP BAYyou no savey Deep Bay young man  full a windy  "  which compliment however it may belong to the Irish gentleman has nothing to do with me when I assure you I am  Most sincerely Yours c C DIBDIN  York    October    LETTER VII  IN WHICH THE READER IS RESCUED FROM THE COMPANY OF A YAWNING AUDIENCE AND A MELANCHOLY CATCH CLUBBY A WHIMSICAL ANECDOTE  "  If in these hallow'd times when sober sad  "  When gentlemen are melancholy mad  "  When 'tis not deem'd so great a crime by half  "  To violate a vestalas to laugh  "  To T S Esq  DEAR SIR  ON Tuesday the twentysecond at noon I made my public appearanceif performing an entertainment before eight and thirty persons can be called sofor the  first  time during twelve years and if I had not a perseverance beyond any other man it would have been my  last  Heaven defend me from such a set of insipid vague unmeaning countenances One of the number I have since performed before at MONMOUTH and another at WAKEFIELD both of whom insisted upon it that the performance was much better than at BATHwhen the fact was they were only in company more disposed to be happy All those passages which to your knowledge have kept the audience in a roar were received with a vacant gravity an unfeeling stare a milk and water indifference Enough as I say of my poet to make a man forswear ever taking a pen in his handyet I found afterwards that they were all pleasedit was only their manner of expressing themselves It was BATH and therefore it would have been vulgar to laugh or give way to any emotion that indicates pleasure such as the heart participates This I had occasion  more minutely to remark by paying a visit to the catchclubwhere even the glass which never circulated more freelynor all the toasts that accompanied itthe songs that relieved it which were pretty well fraught with that reproachful substitute for humour that men who are strangers to real wit find so much pleasure in could scarcely raise a smilethe broad bottoms of the glasses as if instinctively resounded a peal of applause at the end of every song but till the end of the next all was silent as death I note this as an instance of fashionable gravity beyond credibilityfor that a meeting professedly convivial should apparently be held without mirth is a kind of existence without a soula mental deathbut it may be reconciled by saying that it is a refinement on politeness reserved alone to grace the lukewarm court of the lukewarm KING BLADUD  As these remarks on the affected stupidity of the BATH auditors naturally lead to audiences in general I shall while I am on the subject speak a little of the different feelings of different spectators Some have been in raptures about nothingothers have applauded without discriminationsome have intruded their opinions on every body and others have not dared to feel till they had asked the opinions of their neighbours But it is not BATH aloneevery separate place I have seen has its peculiar mode of indicating its pleasure You may remember in a letter written to me some time ago you wondered at my advertising my entertainment at BIRMINGHAM when it was notorious that at one of the meetings where  L'Allegro il ed Pensoroso  was performed the audience was unmoved at every part of it but the line  "Drew iron tears down PLUTO's cheeks"  At BRISTOLwhich place to a proverb is remarkable for hoggishnessthey did not consider so much the quality as when they had enoughand so of the restthe particulars of which local taste will come in their place I cannot however refrain from noticing the delight that  Grog  has given all  the captains of ships and  The Race Horse  A gentleman of Leeds assured me that song had procured an old hunter of his a sinecure for lifefor so much had it roused his fears lest the faithful creature should become a hack on the road and afterwards tug round a mill that even after he should be useless no sum should purchase him out of his possessionnor is this gentleman the only one by many who has made such a resolution Thus by one happy portrait of strong nature have I procured the emancipation of a set of brutal slaveslet the expediency of freeing human ones be left to the decision of others  all the sportsmen The classical men have chuckled at  The Siege of Troy  and the musical at  Pomposo  not to mention that every individual member of all the audiences ever assembled to hear me has bridled up and been charmed beyond measure at the compliment contained in the last four lines of the entertainment I shall conclude this letter with an anecdote of GARRICK and old CERVETTO  When GARRICK returned from ITALY he prepared an address to the audience which he delivered previous to the play he first appeared in When he came upon the stage he was welcomed with three loud plaudits each finishing with a huzza As soon as this unprecedented applause had a little subsided he used every art of which he was so completely master to lull the tumult into a profound silenceand just as all was hushed as death and anxious expectation sat on every face old CERVETTO who was better known by the name of NOSEY anticipated the very first line of the address byawa tremendous yawn A convulsion of laughter ensued and it was some minutes before the wishedfor silence could be again restored That however obtainedGARRICK delivered his address in that happy irresistible manner in which he was always sure to captivate his audience and he retired with applause such as was never better given nor ever deserved But the matter did not rest hereThe moment he came off the stage he flew like lightening to the music room where collaring astonished NOSEY he began to abuse him pretty vociferously  'Whawhyyou old scoundrelyou must be the most infernal'  at length poor CERVETTO  "Oh Mr GARRICK vat is the mattervat I haf doOh God vat it is"    'The matter why you old damned eternal senseless  idiotwith no more brains than your damned bass violjust at theavery moment I had played with the audiencetickled them like a trout and brought them to the most accommodating silenceso pat to my purposeso perfectthat it was as one may say a companion for MILTON's visible darkness'    "Indeed Mr GARRICK it vas no darkness"  Darkness stupid  'foolbut how should a man of my reading make himself understood byaanswer me was not the whole house pit box and gallery very still'  "Yes Sir indeedstill as mouse"  'Well then just at that very moment did you not with your damned jaws extended wide enough to swallow a sixpenny loafyawOh I wish you had never shut your damned jaws again'  "Sare Mr GARRICKonly if you please hear me von vord It is alvay the vayit is indeed Mr GARRICKalvay the vay I go when I haf the greatest  rapture  Mr GARRICK"  The little great man's anger instantly cooled The cunning readiness of this Italian flattery operated exactly contrary to the last line of an epigramthe honey was tasted and the sting forgotand it not only procured NOSEY's pardon but forced a declaration from his patron that he ought to be forgiven for the wit of the offence Upon this principle perhaps the yawning of the BATH audience was all rapturein which case CHURCHILL can only mean that every man has a right to express his feelings his own waymine is to say literally what I mean which I do when I assure you that I am  With great truth Yours c C DIBDIN  York    October    LETTER VIII  TREATING OF FASHIONABLE SINCERITY AND THE HONOUR OF AN IRISH MANAGER  "  All this wheedling of Lucy's is not for nothing  "  To T S Esq  DEAR SIR  I had scarcely returned home after my first performance at BATH when two ladies knocked at my parlour door They were ushered in and having thanked me for my entertainment and professed themselves extremely sorry that I had been so thinly attended they proceeded to assure me that as apparently I was a stranger to the mode of conducting an amusement at BATH they who were leaders of fashionable matters could not refrain from calling to set me right concerning some particulars and offer me such advice as might be condusive to my interest After a good deal of conversation it was agreed that I should suspend the performance to give them an opportunity of enquiring when a repetition of it would be most agreeable to the company then in the town These preliminaries adjusted they went away and one of these ladies actually took the trouble of advising me by letter of what she had learnt and a time was at length appointed which would according to her advice procure me a full audience The morning came and I had the honour of meeting only  sixteen persons  but what most astonished me was that my  two patronesses  did not appear among the number It immediately struck me that they had played me the  second part  of the  same tune  through which I had been so completely  hummed  by the  Irish Jolmon  But whywhereforefrom what motive They wanted no song set to music and yet there must be something in the wind or else why call on me and write letters Not to tire you about such a stupid business I at last learnt for a certainty that they were supporters of the  Old Rooms  and had taken every possible pains to decry the entertainmentto represent me as an impostorand appoint a time when nobody would attendnot because they had the smallest objection to me butbecause I performed at the  New Rooms  Thus at BATH I fell a sacrifice to a stupid caprice in which I had not the smallest concern  At length my eyes were opened by Mr DERHAM the master of the  New Rooms  who assured me it would be the height of folly to attempt another performance I closed with him in opinion and offered the money I had agreed to pay for the rooms which he refused with these words  'Mr DIBDIN however you may have been treated by others in BATH you shall meet with nothing illiberal from me I have no sort of objection to getting money but I never yet got any  dirty  moneyand I am sure I will not begin now If you think I have done you any kindness the only return I require is to hear of your prosperity which I sincerely wish and should be happy to promote'  I shall make no comment on this kind conduct of Mr DERHAM his domestic and general character is too well known to need my panegyrick and I am sure though my regard to justice would not permit me to do so I should have better pleased him had I been totally silent on this head  These matters passed at that notorious moment when the business of Mr TWYCROSS's E O tables engrossed all the conversation of the placewhen the dovehouse exulted and the rookery shook to its foundation That building however I am afraid is erected upon too permanent a footing to be overturned so easily Those are temporary convulsions and only serve to discover the damaged parts that  at a proper expence  they may be the more securely stopped  At this timefor things fall out generally pretty  apropos  with meI received a message from Mr DALY's agent who happened to be at BATH to engage a performer  You may remember in Letter IV I mention an engagement I had made with Mr DALY and this is a proper place to go into the particulars of it To do so I must state the substance of a handbill I was compelled to publish in the month of February last It mentioned that I had entered into an article under a penalty of l with Mr DALY for three years to furnish certain pieces and certain music for the Irish theatre that Mr DALY had broken this article in three several instances two of which I had overlooked and was willing to qualify the third if Mr DALY would let the whole matter go to a reference Thisbeing then in Englandhe seemed to consent to A gentleman on each part was appointed but as it was evident his friend was too closely connected with his interest being afterwards his agent and indeed the very gentleman who sent to me at BATH as above my appointed referee seeing all this wished to have an umpire The business was however trifled with Mr DALY would not sign the bond of arbitration and in short nothing had been done when my friend was obliged to leave town and Mr DALY on the eve of his departure for Ireland In this situation I was determined to bring him to reason and for that purpose commenced an action against himbut resolving to treat him with every kind of delicacy I would not suffer it to be served This he was informed of by my attorney to whom he acknowledged that I had treated him so handsomely and with so much lenity that he engaged his  word  and HONOUR not to leave England till I should be fully and fairly satisfied He thought proper however to forfeit his promise and my friends urged me to publish an account of the matter as a warning to others  This business had stood over from February till the above message I met the gentleman and after a fruitless attempt to obtain my due fearing that some trick might be played meas the article was not at that moment cancelledI  agreed to receive  forty pounds  for TWO HUNDRED and exchange general releases so charmed was I to get rid of so scandalous a business and as it was represented to me that much inconvenience might accrue to Mr DALY from the above handbill which still stood out against him uncontradicted I voluntarily offered to give a declaration under my hand that I was satisfied with the conclusion of the business These matters premised the proper writings were put in hand I received  thirty pounds  in CASH a note at two months of  ten pounds  and a promise  in writing  that the pieces of mine then in Mr DALY's possession should be delivered into the hands of a friend  as soon as possible  Had these promises been fulfilled I should have conceived myself prohibited by my written declaration from publishing this transactionbut as in TEN months instead of  two  the payment is not made nor the pieces returned I look upon the authority I gave to say I was satisfied in the light of a defeasance on the back of a warrant of attorney which is done away if the conditions annexed to it are not literally complied withthe bond therefore as far as it relates to Mr DALY's having behaved unhandsome and dishonourable remains yet in  full force  and  virtue  and if any persons after this chuse to engage with Mr DALY without a proper security I think a statute of lunacy might be taken out against them without much impropriety  I should be wanting to myself and common justice if I did not say before I quit the subject of BATH that with particular pleasure I saw my old friend KEASBURY with whom twenty years ago I have heard  "the chimes at midnight"  He was well and happy and may he long continue so Nor must I omit that I witnessed a most respectable performance at his theatre The farce which was Mr SHERIDAN's  St Patrick's Day  was acted infinitely better than ever I saw it in London Indeed this is one excellent property of a  regular  company in the country the minuter partswhich a town actor thinks so little of and which by the bye are remarkably material witness GARRICK's attention to themare paid much more respect to but however this applies more immediately to BATH where my old friend's veteran judgment and gentlemanly  deportment will always insure from the performers a proper respect and attention But lest it should be thought that I am applying the motto at the head of this letter to any interested purpose I assure you I only wish it to tell against the ladies and the Irish manager for I aver with the truest sincerity that I desire no favour at Mr KEASBURY's hands and only wish I may see him alive and hearty many years to come and that so far from  wheedling  you I mean nothing but truth when I assure you that I am  With great truth Yours c C DIBDIN  York    October    LETTER IX  A FAREWELL TO BATH  "  They talk of beauty that they never saw  "  And fancy raptures that they never felt  "  To T S Esq  DEAR SIR  'TIS indispensably incumbent on me to say something concerning the manners musical taste c of the inhabitants of all those places in which I have been or may yet pass through This however I shall not be even tolerably qualified to do till I come to where I returned to Cambridge having before that time made no resolution to publish my TOUR and therefore of course many matters which I have since treasured were almost forgotten as soon as passed Indeed I do not conceive it at all my province to point out marketdays fairs wakes and statutes the number of inhabitants or talk of corporations charters grants and privileges unless indeed it should seem to be necessary for the illustration and establishment of any particular fact which common opinion has grossly misrepresented Thus I will not call BRISTOL the second town in England in point of the number of inhabitants when I am sure SHEFFIELD contains as manyand I believe MANCHESTER but certainly LIVERPOOL double the number I shall however give such cursory hints as I have promised in my first letter At present I have not quite done with BATHwhich as a city is like a Frenchman's shirtthe ruffle is very fine but the body very coarse Place a man in his sleep in the Crescent and he might upon waking conceive himself in an amphitheatre  erected by the same workmen who built the Temple of Solomon but instead of this place him in one of those blind alleysfor there are no other communicationswhich separate the old town from the new and fancying himself in Fieldlane or St Giles's he would immediately search for his pocket handkerchief In short as I observed before all is either splendidly dull or dirtily vulgar As to their musical taste it is a bad imitation of that in townthey contented themselves with bagpipes till the famous commemoration and then they must squeak belch and snort out oratorios I asked one of their capital hands how they managed to understand HANDEL and he answered me  'they fund un woundy crabbed at first but after they had altered un a little they did un auver rarely'  At the only inn I saw at BATH they were extravagantly dear and intolerably impudent In respect to natural curiosities the Baths may be reckoned of a very extraordinary kindbut every body knows what they are for artificial ones faces and fashions  Just at this time the ladies wore a veil made of one very large piece of gauze which entirely covering the head and monstrous head dress was drawn by a running string and tied about the waste thus exhibiting a thin but prodigious globe on their heads and no sort of addition on their petticoatsfor hoops and trimming were out of fashionevery lady but especially if she was tall and thin looked like a stalk of dandelion run to seed the heads of which children under the name of mops and something else blow for pastime into the air  exhibit them at every corner In short BATH is the fittest place in the world for  art  to banquet on  credulity  for  extravagance  and  folly  to go unmasked at noon day for  reason  and  wisdom  to shunand to speak in the language of the poet for  rakes  and  idiots  "to talk of  beauty  that they  never saw  and fancy  raptures  that they  never felt  "  In my next letter you will find me at BRISTOL at which place and in all places even in the luxury of an orange grove shaded by the spreading cedar and refreshed by the spiceconveying breeze I shall not be less than at this moment  Yours c C DIBDIN  Beverly    Oct    LETTER X  A COMPARATIVE VIEW OF DIET AND GORMANDIZING AND ANOTHER OF THEATRICAL MERIT  "  All the world's a stage  "  And all the men and women merely players  "  To T S Esq  DEAR SIR  WOULD one think it possible that a distance of only twelve miles should make such a difference in manners as to present you with two distinct species of human beings At BATH every thing is  superficial  at BRISTOL every thing  substantial  At BATH every thing  gay  at BRISTOL every thing  grave  In BATH they live in  fine houses  and are  poor  in BRISTOL in  shabby ones  and are rich At  careless  BATH nothing is thought of but the  present moment  at  provident  BRISTOL no step is taken but with a view to the advantage of  posterity  In short they are both actuated by an equal though different species of folly for one flies off from the reasonable part of human pursuits and seeks for pleasures that have no place but in the imagination like a volatile body which leaves the earth and loses itself in space while the other is buried in the muck and grossness of sensual enjoyments till the wearied appetite is sunk in gorged satiety without capacity to know distinction  On my arrival at BRISTOL which was on Monday in the passion week the first objects that presented themselves when I alighted from the coach  were three living turtles lying on their backs This circumstance soon produced me an account from the WAITER that on the following week the DUKE OF PORTLAND was expected there with a large body of the minority and that ships had been dispatched to fetch good cheer on the joyful occasion Their only fear it seems was that as his GRACE laboured under an indisposition and was obliged to eat by prescription he could not be able to cut any capital figure at the noble exercise of the knife and fork Mr Fox Mr SHERIDAN and their facetious colleague Capt MORRIS who it was reported was hired on purpose to abuse the ministers in a new song set to an old tune were however expected to fill up the principal parts in the gormandizing concert which was to finish with a capital duetto between burgundy and disaffection But so fallacious are the hopes and precarious the expectation of turtleeaters as well as all other sublunary beings that these glorious prospects vanished like a dream for the DUKE OF PORTLAND came almost aloneno one adherent of consequence having accompanied him but LORD STORMONT whose passion in no way leaning from the line of a perfect gentleman and a true bred man of fashion the poor dear BRISTOL MEN felt awkwardly throughout the whole business and were even some say heard to groan when they presented the DUKEnot with his  freedom  for that cost nothingbut with the  gold box  and  five pounds a year  for though this last was not sterling yet a promise with a merchant is the same as moneythe salary annexed to the high office to which they did his GRACE the honour to call him  Passion week  being observed in BRISTOL with great exactness by way of balance in hand to answer the expected disbursements during the feasts after  Easter  nothing like amusements could be thought of In the  Easter week  every moment was appropriated to the DUKE OF PORTLAND therefore of course I could not get my entertainment in edge ways On the week following when I did perform it and heaven knows to very little purpose the constant cry wasthat so much  more  money had been expended on the above occasion than was expected that they were obliged to pull up a littlebut if  I would stay a fortnight longer and perform upon more reasonable terms there could be no doubt but I should find it worth my while Never having been fond of any thing so rigidly methodical and fearing it would not answer my purposethe constant maxim of a BRISTOL MAN being to take care that nobody shall  get any thing by him  I gave the matter up and devoted the remainder of my time to pleasure  Among the  rest  for the first time I had ever seen any thing written by Mrs INCHBALDI attended at the performance of  Such Things are  and  The Widow's Vow  the first of which I should have known belonged to a lady if it had been only for  the wig  which I will venture to say outdoes every thing in Mrs BEHN's  Rover  The parts were many of them incomparably well played I never saw Mr LEWIS in  Twineall  but I should think nothing could surpass BERNARD in that character Mr DIAMOND was very correct and able in  Haswell  and indeed where there would otherwise have been any deficiency perfectness and good discipline gave the whole an air of respectability which I could wish to see imitated on a LONDON Theatrewhere frequently in a game of romps the author is kicked and buffetted about in a most unmerciful manner In these particulars my old valuable friend JEFFERSONwho hearing I was at BRISTOL came from BATH on purpose to see meperfectly agreed with me What can be the reason JEFFERSON is not engaged in TOWN This question I did not ask him but it has twenty times occurred to me Surely the man whom GARRICK took delight to perform with cannot but be an object to the  Theatre  He was constantly as every body knows the  Colonel Briton  to his  Dox Felix  the  Claudio  to his  Benedict  the  Aimwell  to his  Archer  the  Frederick  to his  Don John  and I could name many other similar instancesnay when he left off walking as  Benedick  in the  Jubilee  he chose JEFFERSON as the only person that could represent him JEFFERSON is like GARRICK in the face and he gives you a strong idea of him altogether only larger Nor let it be said that GARRICK used him  as a soil  It is well known at the  Theatre  that GARRICK was particularly careful to have those  plays well got up in which he appeared himself Upon these occasions he had recourse wherever he could to JEFFERSON PARSONS WESTON and DODD Did not then GARRICK's judgment rank JEFFERSON respectably It is true he shrunk a little from the very firstrate abilities He would never couple with BARRY in  Tragedy  and very reluctantly indeed with KING in  Comedy  and if the common course of the business made it indispensiblefor where is there a play in which KING has not successfully performedyou will always see that the two characters wear so very different a complexion that no auditor can draw a comparative view of their merits And here I cannot refrain from noticing that there was no man whom Mr GARRICK openly caressed and secretly hated so much as Mr KING  I'll bring this fact home to Mr KING's recollection Mr GARRICK prepared a prose Dialogue which was spoken by himself and that gentleman at the  Jubilee  immediately after the  Ode  a time when there was not the smallest possibility of receiving attention to any thing But this was not enoughWhat part did Mr KING act Why truly in the place where about twelve hundred people were in enthusiastic admiration of SHAKESPEARE he was to find out a thousand faults in his writing Nor was this ungrateful task fairly set aboutfor written by Mr GARRICK the objections were all pretendedthe better to shew his defence of the poet by way of answer  I know this fact or I would not assert it and I believe it may be easily reconciled when we consider that Mr KING added to his uncommon merit as a performer is an  independent man  Yet with all his faults should the memory of GARRICK be revered I have an enthusiastic reverence for his merit as a performerand as JEFFERSON was at least his faithful and approved companion in his theatrical career let us no more neglect him when we think of GARRICK than we would  Pylades Achates  and  Patrocles  when we think of  Orestes Aeneas  or  Achilles  Perhaps however as my interest at the  Theatre  is not very strong I had better have let alone this recommendation of my friendbut it cannot at any rate injure him with the worldand as his ideas at least like mine are independent he must content himselffor no man through the wonderful serenity of his disposition is more easily contentedwith being  respected  instead of  affluent  My opinion however of my theatrical influence was somewhat different at the time I mentionfor on that morning I met Mr HARRIS who was  for the benefit of his health at the  Hot Wells  This gentleman so corroborated the contents of the letter I formerly mentioned that during the play I took measure of BERNARD and BLANCHARDand they may remember I told them sofor those parts I intended to introduce for them in a  new Opera  which has been long since finished but I fear will never be performed  In this letter you see I have stuck close to my mottofor whether men perform the farce of greatness zeal fashion or gormandizing in real life or on the stage as FOOTE says  "the purpose is the same and the place immaterial"  As I have not in the writing of those letter a single document to consult but my memory how naturally have the greatest part of my quotations been from SHAKESPEARE VOLTAIRE meaning to abuse him pays that wonderful poet a most elegant compliment He says  "The English because they find in SHAKESPEARE many passages fraught so strongly with force and nature that they get them by heart  in spite of themselves  think him a great writer"  If they wanted a better proof I am sure it was not in Mr VOLTAIRE's power to give it them  Adieu  Yours very sincerely C DIBDIN  Why have I not heard from you  Beverly    October    LETTER XI  A GRATEFUL SUBJECT  "  Nay do not think I flatter  "  To T S Esq  DEAR SIR  AS so many procrastinations threw some time on my hands I improved it as much as possible by cultivating the friendship of a gentleman whose professional abilities and private virtues endear him to all who have the pleasure of his acquaintance A better proof I think of his  private worth  need not be given than that he passes from eight to twelve hours out of twentyfour in fagging at teaching that most miserable of all drudgery and the remainder cherishing his wife and improving his children Nor need I hold him up better as a model of  professional excellence  than by remarking that he has genius judgment taste and what is better good sense to regulate them His compositions which are many of them models for harpsichord music never sink to mediocrity and often rise to perfection He has not the folly to substitute abstruseness for nature but contents himself with  pleasing  instead of  surprising  As a performer he shall take any man's stile and excel himand I will demonstrate it in a moment First there is no passage ever so difficult but he can executeand what no other player I ever heard could attainI mean keeping regular timehe has in the highest perfection for let the passage be ever so rapid or interwoven a child with an ear may as easily mark the accented parts as of the most familiar tune I beg however I may be understood to mean that my friend is no conjurer nor performer  of impossibilitiesfor threefourths of harpsichord music have neither plan nor motive nor indeed any drift but difficultyin particular those unmeaning senseless rhapsodies in music that were they executed by APOLLO would have no better effect than a Dutch concert For the sake of simplicity that beautiful groundwork of all sublimity I hope I am understoodand yet is not that hope like many of mine fruitless I shall make myself clear however by saying there are two positions in music which common sense says must ever be kept separate and apart These are the different distinctions of timeone is to count  four  and the other  three  Yet the musicmongersagainst common sensewith no other remedy for their imbecility than abstrusenessno other substitute for their sterile and unprofitable imaginations than extraneousnesspretend to make one hand play four and the other three  in  and  at  the SAME TIME Cannot the most common understanding without the smallest knowledge of music see in one moment that this is an impossibility If you should go to BRISTOL call on Mr BOYTONthe gentleman to whom I have alluded aboveand he will for my sake be glad to see youunless he should be offendedwhich I entreat he will notat my endeavouring to do him a piece of justice which he will think more than he deserves though I well know my utmost praise is inadequate to his merit The subject of this letter has given me so much pleasure that I will not mix it with other matter I cannot flatterbut 'tis like winning ones own heart to speak the praises of the deserving 'Tis hard you will not write to meyet were you never more to do so I could not cease to be  Most heartily Yours c C DIBDIN  Beverly    Oct    LETTER XII  A DIGRESSION  "  He has the wide world for his heritage  "  TO THE PUBLIC  I have ever conceived it the utmost height of extravagant folly to deal with even the slightest appearance of disingenuousness in any appeal to the public The truth is so easily toldand besides it brings with it such a saving of trouble art and duplicityall which are mighty disagreeable thingsthatexclusive of the comfortable conviction that a man's argument cannot fairly be controverted'tis in every other way his interest to keep that honest manly monitor in view Thus to give fairly up the most distant appearance of double dealing I shall address no more letters to T S EsqNot that I have altered my sentiments in any respect relative to that gentlemanI know his admirable talents nice discernment and correct judgmentI know these letters would have been greatly benefitted by his remarksI know his erudition is profound his taste elegant and his stile beautiful Nor do I at this moment believe he has altered his opinion in relation to me and as one strong proof of ifthough I confess I have yet received no answer to my  second  letter which introduced the  five  successive ones as will be seen by comparing their dateshe very lately told a particular friend of mine that my  seven  first lettersI use his own words  "are wonderfully well written"  The fact is I hope to leave England by the beginning of April and chance having thrown  this gentleman and I such a distance from each other were I to wait for answers respectively to my letters it would now be morally impossible for this publication to come out till I had lost the INDIA season I thereforeas I have frequently done and I never repented itthrow myself upon the candour of the Public not however in the paltry manner in which their indulgence is too frequently solicited on the stage  This brings to my mind a whimsical anecdote which I cannot avoid giving a place TOMMY HULL who is well known to have been the  apologistgeneral  at  Covent Garden Theatre  for about five and twenty years took it into his head at the time of the dispute between KEPPEL and PALLISER to distinguish himself as a  lad of liberty  On the night when all LONDON was illuminated on KEPPEL's acquittal he undertook not only to light up his tenement in  Martletcourt Bowstreet  but treat the populace with  small beer  They had drank all but one barrel which out of wantonnessbecause it was rather stalethey left running The door was now shut lest some of the  liberty boys  should take a fancy to the  silver spoons  At this they grew clamourous and bawled out very outrageously for  more beer  TOMMYas was his customthinking it high time he should now make his appearancepopped his red nightcapped head out of the window and there was immediately a cry of  "hear himhear him"  When he thus began  'Ladies and gentlemen I have the misfortune to tell youthat the spiggot is out of the fauset and the small beer is run about the cellar  and we humbly hope for  YOUR USUAL INDULGENCE  but backed with an assurance that though the front of my army cannot come up yet I am winged with particular literary friends and well flanked with casual ones add to which I have several outpostswell situatedof wellwishers and an admirable  corps de reserve  of  the lovers of music  nor am I yet without hope that I shall derive some assistance from the main body Thus when all my forces are mustered together I flatter myself I shall not fail of a complete victory over my enemies whom I shall deliver up to the public to be  admonished  and FORGIVEN  A friend of mine when he swore an oath would sayGod forgive mewhich he called rubbing out as he went Thusby way of clearing my ground or as the sailors call it bringing up leewayI shall make this letter one entire digression into which I shall collect all extraneous matter And firstbeing  figuratively  at one place and  literally  at anotherit may be asked why I did not set down those transactions I celebrate at the time they happened I have already said that at my first setting out I had not the smallest  idea of writing any account of my TOUR at all AgainCircumstances at the first blush dressed in the delusive charms of novelty have a strength and false glow which upon a nearer investigation meliorate into sober truth and wear off the influence of primary prejudice Thus had I spoken of my friend BOYTON in the moment I was witness of his wonderful performance I might have injured him by exaggeration and in this I give the strongest possible instancebecause language can scarcely produce an hyperbole on the subject To give a contrary instanceHad I not waited till contempt had died away and given place to indifference I could not probably have told my story of the  Irish Jolmon  with that triumphant coolness which will never cease to make a much more uncomfortable wound than the keenest shafts of hasty resentment I insist upon it CIBBER gave POPE more uneasiness and the world a better opinion of his good sensein his easy welltempered facetious letterthan did the other atchieve against CIBBER or with the publicwith all his weight of abilitiesin the laboured bitterness of his invidious  Dunciad  It has often occurred to me as a matter of astonishment that any one after reading the  Dunciad  should doubt POPE's being an envious man Nothing can be more selfevident than that he wrote more than any man for  same  and what could divert him from such a pursuit to lose time on a work which must die with the names it stigmatises butENVY How one digression introduces another Take the following lines on ENVY  See ENVYfrom her cheeks the colour fled  While  aconite  and  nightshade  bind her head  See how her shrivel'd shanks with palsy shake  How her lips quiverwhile a forked snake  Pointing her tongue sends poison in each hiss  To wound the happy in the hour of bliss  See where she skulks with torn dishevell'd hair  Push'd urg'd and goaded onby  lank  DESPAIR  I might have rashly blamed one man for a slight or an unkindness that originated in another and I might have extolled a third for  tinselled  wit whichfrom a graceful manner and faithful memoryhe had the art to pass for sterlingFOOTE when he heard GARRICK repeat his ode at the  Jubilee  declared  whether the subject had inspired himwhether the genius of SHAKESPEARE had deigned to illuminate his fancy with some rays of its wonderful effector from whatever cause it proceeded he knew notbut that certainly the ode was elegantly and poetically written The next morninghaving read ithe swore he must have been in a dream  FOOTE had the most contemptible opinion of GARRICK's literary abilities He once received an anonymous letter which pointed out to him a French play as an excellent subject for his theatre This circumstance he mentioned to a nobleman who happened that evening to be behind the scenes adding that he should be particularly happy to know the author as it was incomparably well writtenfor among other  traits  there were several quotations that spoke a perfect and elegant knowledge of classical reading Said HIS LORDSHIP  'I think I can guess at him'  "Can you my lord"  said FOOTE  "I wish I could"  'What do you think of GARKICK'  "Oh no my lord"  answered the wit  "I am sure it is not GARRICK"  'Why'  returned his lordship  "I shall answer"  says FOOTE  "like SCRUB  First  I am sure it is not GARRICK because there's  Greek  in it  Secondly  I am sure it is not GARRICK because there's  Latin  in it and  thirdly  I am sure it is not GARRICK because there's  English  in it"  for that the whole was the most stupid rhapsody of incongruous nonsense that ever was listened to If he had taken a month to consider of it and had been unprejudiced he probably would have decided that it was a meritorious attempt and if not executed in a manner worthy the subjectwhich could not be without the pen of another SHAKESPEAREthe errors of the  poet  ought to have been forgotten in the inimitable merit of the  speaker  which was beyond all description admirable and fairly equal to the wonderful task  Having cleared away all the froth of the whipped syllabub to which this letter may be compared I am now come to the  drop of wine  at the bottom It was written howsoever the rovings of fancy may have led me astray in a great measureto say this  Five minutes before I sat down to this table where I am now writing being at BEVERLY in Yorkshire I dispatched to the printer at HULL a manuscript of the  proposal  for publishing my MUSICAL TOUR It immediately afterward occurred to me as a thing not impossible that when the list of subscribers  come to be published if the names of all those I praise should appear in it some of my kind friends may be so civil as to consider what I have said as so many purchased encomiums and as a man practises firing at a mark to put himself  au sait  to a duelso by anticipation do I falsify all such malice At this present writing I do not know who will subscribe and I cannot speak warmer or cooler of people than I have occasionally done already besides I must be a poor hireling indeed to sell panegyricks for twelve shillings a piece To be more serious I declare solemnly that no consideration shall warp my pen to the deformity of an invidious lie norwhich would be equally reprehensiblethe prostitution of unmerited praise Kindness has a most wonderful effect upon me Perhaps because I have received as little of it as any man There are many living instances that I can forget injuries but never obligations and tho' many parts of this work will sting  home  and I would have them do soyet will they wound the keener because it will be plainly seenI have no  rancour  I have met with more real kindness during my MUSICAL TOUR than in all the rest of my life put togetheryet think not I mean of a pecuniary natureI detest all servile considerations  Rectitude  is a chearful companion and nothing is so ponderous as  obligation  Though I hope this very book will yield me a good sum of moneyyet I should receive it with reluctance if I did not feel I had EARNED IT These sentiments will not I am sure be censured by the public who have not in the whole round of their servants one more ambitious to merit their favour than  The obliged And grateful C DIBDIN  Beverly    October    LETTER XIII  AN ADIEU TO BRISTOL  "  Life's but a walking shadow a poor player  "  That frets and struts his hour upon the stage  "  And thonis heard no more  "  To Mr B  MY DEAR FRIEND  YOU who so largely contributed to make BRISTOL agreeable to me deserve in preference to any other this letter which I take the liberty of addressing to youespecially as it comes where I am to describe those beautiful situations with which that place abounds and which would for ever have been unknown to me but for your kind solicitude You taught me to admire the extensive and picturesque views from DURDHAM DOWN CLIFDEN HILL COOK'S FOLLY  There is a strange anecdote related of this place One COOK dreamt that he was bit by an adder and it so preyed on his mind that he built this place which is very lofty and resided wholly in the upper apartment One cold day his servant brought in a faggot that concealed an adder which upon being disturbed flew at Mr COOK bit himand he died of the wound The reader may give what portion of credit he pleases to this tale  and KING'S WESTON Nor had I more pleasure in the charming variety these sweet places afforded than in your conversation What a number of circumstances it called home to my recollection as you pointed out the former theatre to me where POWELL HOLLAND  What I am now going to relate I know to be fact and it conveys nearly as strong a presentiment as the above The last time HOLLAND ever performed he was in unusual spirits During the evening he related a number of anecdotesbut it was remarkable he continually alluded to POWELL He repeated the lines written by Mr COLMAN and which he had spoken on POWELL's death At length I heard him repeat these extraordinary words  "The first time I ever saw POWELL was at a  spoutingclub  where he and I performed  Posthumous  and  Jachimo  The first time we ever played on the stage together was  Posthumous  and  Jachimo  The last time we ever played togetherand added he with a sigh it was the last time HE ever playedwas  Posthumous  and  Jachimo  "  What makes this matter singular almost beyond belief isthat the time he made these observations he was performing  Jachimo  and he died a few days after  and so  many of the old school were such favourites Poor POWELL Poor HOLLAND The one a sacrifice to youthful impetuosity  POWELL was a well dispositioned young man but he was weak and his professional and personal vanity got the better of every tie or consideration He was handsome lively and presuming to which if we add that he was a manager it will be seen that it was an easy matter to make  his  terms with many of the actresses provided he acceded to  their's  Indeed his amours were not confined to the theatre keptmistresses and demireps were continually sending him letters to the stagedoor none of which solicitations he had the courage to resist The consequence was fatal and inevitablehe died a martyr to his pleasures for what head could even a robust constitution make against the wasteful conflict of mercury and stimulatives His acting was strong nature as luxuriant as a wilderness It had a thousand beauties and a thousand faults He felt so forcibly that in any impassioned situation tears came faster than words and frequently choaked his utterance If GARRICK had never gone to Italy and we can suppose he would have  honestly  instructed himthere was certainly no height of perfection in tragedy to which such abilities could not have reached but GARRICK's performance in real life was not the worst part of his acting POWELL as an actor visibly declined from the moment his tutor turned his back on himso much does nature want assistance on the stage  the other a proof that the most rigid prudence is no safeguard against the grim tyrant  HOLLAND was extremely different from POWELL as an actor and a manhe kept as respectable a public situation and his company was more courted He had not received a liberal education but his intellects were of that strong clear and decided kind they performed for him the task of a tutor so well that his decisions upon all occasions were founded in sound judgment and experience He was free goodnatured cheerful and generousnor had he an unkind wish to any human creature He indulged himself as much as any young man reasonably oughtyet with his purse and his heart ever openthough sprung from obscurity which he had too much good sense to concealat the age I believe of thirtythree he lest his family six thousand pounds As to his acting what he wanted of POWELL's natural requisites he made up in strong discrimination One was susceptiblethe other critical Whoever remembers their playing those favourite parts  Posthumous  and  Jachimo  will feel the truth of this observation POWELL made the strongest first impression HOLLAND pleased you most upon repetition POWELL though he often charmed sometimes disgusted you HOLLAND even where you could not admire him gave you no pain In short POWELL owed to naturewhat HOLLAND owed to himself and if after all we are obliged to admit something of preeminence on the side of POWELL and thus regret his loss as an actor we cannot refrain from heaving a deeper sigh when we consider that in HOLLAND we lost an honest man and a valuable member of society  Before I quit this subject I shall relate an anecdote relative to the funeral of POOR HOLLAND He was one of FOOTE's greatest favourites perhaps in some measure because the world said he was the retailer of his wit but there was no occasion HOLLAND had wit enough of his ownbesides Aristophanes dealt in the retail way himself GEORGE GARRICK being one of HOLLAND's executors with his usual good naturefor no man possessed moreundertook to manage the funeral in a way suitable to his friend's circumstances for which purpose he went to CHISWICK and ordered a decent vault and such other preparations as he thought necessaryHOLLAND's father was a baker FOOTE was invited to the funeral which he certainly attended with unseigned sorrow for exclusive of his real concern for the loss of a convivial companion whenever he had a serious moment he felt with very strong susceptibility While the ceremony was performing G GARRICK remarked to FOOTE how happy he was out of respect to his friend to see every thing so decently conducted  "You see"  said he  "what a snug family vault we have made here"    '  Family vault  '  said FOOTEwith the tears trickling down his cheeks  'Damme if I did not think it had been  the family oven  '  From the  theatre you led me to that natural wonder the  Hot Well  and to that still superior one  St Vincent's  as well as that vast chain of rocks which form a convenient boundary to conduct the river safely to KINGROAD employ a number of workmen make up highways build houses and supply foppish peasants with glittering sleevebuttons  As to the musical taste of BRISTOL the treatment at inns and other indispensible matters I shall mention them when I return for I will not give you pain by speaking truth of your neighbours Adieu  Yours With the truest friendship C DIBDIN  Hull    Nov    LETTER XIV  FROM A NEW CORRESPONDENT  "  Even as one wedge driveth out another  "  To Mr DIBDIN  DEAR SIR  WHEN I had the pleasure of witnessing your performance I said but the truth when I assured you it would be no trifling satisfaction to me to promote whatever you should consider as your interest As to your request of addressing your public letters to me I embrace with great satisfaction an opportunity of receiving an earlier entertainment from them than the rest of your friends Nobody can be more zealous in your cause There is I confess one consideration that will make me read them with reluctanceevery succeeding letter will be one approach nearer to your departure which you know I never cordially likedthough I own you have conquered every scruple but one Answer me What will the people of INDIA say of you when they see in your book that you make a visit to them your  sorlorn hope  You see I begin the office of a friend by treating you with freedom My remarks however will not be very troublesome to you Your career is brilliant and it were pity to stop it Adieu I have read thirteen letters and be assured I shall make a perusal of the rest supercede every other consideration of business or pleasurebeing  Your sincere friend And obedient servant *****  Nov    LETTER XV  ANSWER  "  There's an especial Providence in the fall of a sparrow  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I thought the best way of thanking you for your letter would be to insertand answer it It shall be printed however without your namenor shall I publicly use it at all though out of kindness you have stipulated for no such arrangement My reason is that though  I  may find it necessary to go to loggerheads with witlings and crotchetmongers it would be unhandsome to bring you in as my second or even bottleholder Thanking you heartily for your zeal and kindness and assuring you that I shall take every care to merit your attention to my letters and by that means insure myself the good opinion of the public I shall first answering your only remaining scruple proceed on my TOUR The prejudices of general opinion from which I believe no man is wholly free incline one naturally to form ideas of a long voyage a foreign climate a strange race of people and new laws and customs that after fairly and maturely consulting our reason we really find do not exist These beget a repugnance to leave our native land which were it examined would be found to originate in folly and ignorance I am sure there is not more danger in a long voyage than a long journey I have myself been overturned during this TOUR in a chaise and was within a very little of breaking my neck Lloyd's Evening Post contained some time ago an account of a gentleman who having been two voyages to the EastIndies returned and in taking  a short journey in the mailcoachwas overturned and killed As to a foreign climate can it be worse than the month of November in England For strange peoplethey are to be met with every where New laws cannot certainly be better than the  spirit  of those in this countrybut the  letter  and the  execution  cannot any where be  worse  I shall hereafter have occasion to animadvert a little stronger on this subject It is very true I leave England because I think I have not been well treated but surely this is paying a compliment to the liberality of INDIA They love pleasureit is in my power to give it to them The compact is a fair one and if they find me capable to take a review of their amusements regulate them supply them with novelty put them upon an eligible and permanent footing and at length leave them in possession of such materials as will induce them to encourage me while I stay and remember me afterwardswhat will it be between us but a mutual obligation And yet though I argue so coolly and I hope reasonably I had till very lately every one of the above vulgar prejudices and absurd notionsfor which no man alive can invent a rational excuse Nay I had eight years ago gone to INDIA could I have conquered these scruples whichthough I had in great measure got the better ofreturned with irresistable force upon receiving the news of my brother's death My election however is now made yet believe me I go not like an exile I go to give and receive pleasure and advantageto earn honestly a competency and return with it to my native country If there be any difficulties to encounter I shall hope to surmount them by the means of unconquerable spirits and a strong constitution and if after allit should so happen that I am beckoned there by the finger of fate I could not better obey the summons than in believing with our immortal poet  "that there's an especial providence in the fall of a sparrow"  I am not however foolhardy enough to court the accomplishment of this nor will I say with the philosopher  "ungrateful  country thou shalt not have my ashes"  Sacred be destiny's immutable decree  I once expressed these sentiments in the following song  SONG  WHAT of fortune would'st tell meI know all the  past    Am content with the fate I'm at  present  possessing  And if for the  future  our lots are all cast  We might there find a  curse  where we hop'd for a  blessing  What's hid in the stars then is not worth our care  We shall know it too soon if 'tis any vexation  If 'tis good fortunepleasure's a little too rare  To rob ourselves of it byanticipation  II  Then curiously seek not the mysteries of fate  To exploreby a vain idle passion directed  The knowledge of ill cannot lessen its weight  And joy is most welcome when least 'tis expected  What's hid in the stars c  I shall be proud to see you again in Old England and assure you face to face as I do now under my hand that I am  With great truth Your obliged friend And humble servant C DIBDIN  Newark    Nov    LETTER XVI  ONE SUSPICION REPAID BY ANOTHER  "  Since the world willwhy let it be deceived  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  FROM BRISTOLI sat out with a view to perform a night or two at GLOUCESTER to which placeI cannot avoid noticingI had a most beautiful journey The wonderful rich soil round that city so invigorates vegetation that the country looked as if the season had been a month older but when I arrived one would have sworn the place was entirely deserted I could not help fancying that some public occasion had invited all the inhabitants to a distance No such thing It arose from nothing more thanas the residents in other places get out and mix with each other and thus enjoy the comforts of sociality and good fellowshipthose at GLOUCESTER stay at home in their own hugger mugger wayand form no acquaintance but with the cats and crickets by the fire side Without exaggeration'tis so remarkable for its dullness that you may upon an average look from one end of the street to the other twenty times and not at any one time see twenty people This gave me but poor hopes of GLOUCESTER Nor were my expectations more sanguine when in a conversation with Mr RAIKES I found the town was as much in sackcloth as if there had been a general mourning Four or five unexpected bankruptcies had thrown them into a consternation not to be described which added to their natural gloom made GLOUCESTER at that time the most unfit of all places for making an experiment  with my entertainment I therefore got into a chaise and posted away to CHELTENHAM but there were yet arrived only a sick lord an old maid and a monkeyso I stayed all night slept in a damp bed  This is infallible if any one should sleep there in the month of April  and went on to WORCESTER Of this pretty and very sprightly townI ownI augured well Nor was I deceived in my expectations I found the inhabitants however very tardy and had it not been for a reverend and honourable gentlemanwho never fails to countenance public amusements whenever he can with proprietyI should never have had a second night This owed its rise to a reportwhich somebody had very good naturedly propagatedthat I was an impostor When one considers it has been affirmed that a man took thirty pounds to be shot for ADMIRAL BYNGand that FOOTE had his leg cut off on purpose to procure a patentoras some have maintainedto give him a graceful hitch in his walkis it wonderful that a stranger should have some difficulty in proving his own identity They were however reasoned with in the following manner 'Tis true this man may possibly not be Mr DIBDINin which case those who attend his performance would be subject to some kind of raillery but it is also possible he may be the very identical manand that admitted would not his departure in dudgeon bring a stronger ridicule on the place  'Suppose'  said a fewwho really were possessed of something like reason  'the first performance should be watched with a critical eye and a report spread as to its merit and the originality of its fabricationif he be an impostor it will be then time enough to give way to our resentment if not surely he deserves some apology and future attentionfor having paid us the compliment to come among us'  So saidso done I was attended by eleven critics who I am sure had made up their minds before they camefor it so happened that they had good sense enough to see there does not exist a man who could have performed what I promised and yet have been an impostorI plainly perceived the drift of this  manoeuvre  and went through my entertainment with a spirit that surprised my audience When I had finishedan  apology was made me in the name of the city of WORCESTERand to be brief I had afterwards four very decent nights and that not satisfying them they exacted a promise from me to return in the race week  The report of my being an impostor originated from an unmarried lady who had seen me she said at BIRMINGHAM and whoas she did not confess herself a member of the tribe of old maidswas not a little nettled as I afterwards understood when I remarkedupon hearing this storythat her love of justice had got the better of her  amour propre  for that by mentioning BIRMINGHAMwhere I had not been for twentyfive yearsshe was tacitly obliged to agree to an age rather more ancient than it was her usual custom to acknowledge  I shall speak of WORCESTER more fully on my returnand in the mean time beg the favour of your company to BIRMINGHAMwhither I went in the stage coach in company with a plain agreeable man who I could very soon perceive was intimately concerned in some large manufactory As I am upon all occasions just as willing that the laugh should go against myself as another I here inform you of a matter in which I conceived myself to be wonderfully sagacious About ten months before the period I speak ofor as Mr BAYES has it long before the beginning of this playI went with a party to dinner at the ISLE OF WIGHT where a genteel man sent in his compliments and requested he might dine with the company Our own being rather a promiscuous meeting he was readily admitted He turned out to be a pleasant chatty companionseemed to be very ready on every general topicbut the whole of his conversation appeared purposely to allude to his being a man of property I took it for granted that he was soand did not testify a little surprise when the landlord told me he was a rider or what they call in Yorkshire  a bagman  I was determined afterwards to take care who I believed to be men of propertyand this Journey from WORCESTER to BIRMINGHAM was the first time afterward that my suspicions were awakened  Every time the gentleman was talking of bills of parcels and bails of goods I could not get rid of the idea of  bagman  and before we arrived I had actually set him down for a vain empty pretender to propertya pattern carriera stirrup holderin short the very shadow of what he appeared to be During the interval between our arrival and dinner he went outand the waiter asking if I knew who that gentleman was I answered carelesslysome bagman I fancy  'Bagman'  cried the waiter  'the gentleman is worth eighty thousand poundsa great clothier near CHELTENHAM'  This incident may serve to shew how deceitful are appearances and it should teach us this lessonto pay every object its proper degree of respectfor as there is no rank ever so high but vice may debaseso there is no station ever so low but virtue will exalt Both these men behaved very properly One kept a little higher than his real rank like an able ambassador to demand respect to his masterwhile the other like a king condescended a littleto shew he had no pride If it had not been for the officiousness of the landlord at the ISLE OF WIGHT I should never have knownthat the first had only credentials to shew nor suspectedthat the latter was the less a man of property for not assuming airs of consequence How I came to be thus suspicious I cannot conceive My characteristicand 'tis no feather in my capis credulity and my pocket and peace of mind have often smarted for believing the  ipse dixit  of other men in preference to the evidence of my own senses The poet says  "since the world will why let it be deceived"  Do not you however believe that there is the smallest deceit in my assuring you that I am  Yours Most faithfully C DIBDIN  Nottingham    Nov    LETTER XVII  VARIOUS SUCCESS AT BIRMINGHAM OXFORD AND LONDON  "  Vain his attempt who strives to please you all  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  OUT of three times that I advertised my entertainment at BIRMINGHAMI performed it only twice These fuliginous sons of Vulcan were at my arrival too busily attending to feats of horsemanshipa species of amusement ever fatal to my interestto take any notice of me One thing completely disgusted me At WORCESTER it was suggested to me that as my price was three shillings the tradesmen and others in middling situations could not afford to pay that sum or mix with the company who couldand therefore I made a distinction and partitioning the town hallwhich is very largeadmitted company at three shillings and eighteenpence The spirit of the people was roused at this circumstanceand very few indeed were to be found in the back seats while those in the front were crowded Upon making the same experiment at BIRMINGHAM it was exactly the reversefor as the inhabitants of WORCESTER of middling property made a point of paying three shillings so people of very considerable property in BIRMINGHAM skulked in at eighteenpence One circumstance I own made me look upon BIRMINGHAM as a very likely place for success It was the first town in which I appeared as an actor and as I signified this by a paragraph in the hand bills and madewhat I there saida sort of invitation to witness the maturity of those abilities which they had seen in their infancy  I naturally supposed I should awaken their curiosityand that they would be pouring in by hundreds Not a bit The people of BIRMINGHAM were too much taken up with hobnails and horsemanship to pay me the least attention Upon mentioning my surprise to a Frenchman he exclaimed  Mon dieu que est ce que voulez vous Comment agir pour faire un cheval vuider l'avoine q'il n'ai jamais mange  '  I confessed the justice of the remark and comforted myself with a letter I had in my pocket from Dr HAYES enclosing one from THE VICE CHANCELLOR which gave me leave to come to OXFORD for three days in the following week  Thus I left BIRMINGHAMwithout being able to sing the glee of  "Smiths are good fellows"  Of my journey to OXFORD I can give you no farther accounthaving travelled in the nightthan that at the  White Lion  at STRATFORDUPONAVONthat very Inn which I saw in such confusion at the JUBILEEwe had the most scandalous supper that ever was set upon a table But as on my return to WORCESTER I shall have something to say further of this house you will now if you please attend me to Dr HAYES who received me with his accustomed cordiality and politeness We settled the mode of commencing the entertainment and I waited on the VICE CHANCELLOR to thank him for his kindness and request that I might submit the copy of my amusement to his inspection He was pleased to sayhe had a particular pleasure in obliging me andas he did not suppose I would offer any entertainment to the students unworthy my reputation or their attentionhe trusted the matter wholly to me and thought a perusal of the copy totally unnecessary  The first night was announcedand with every care and circumspection I prepared for it I cut out  Grog  and introducedfor the first time it was ever sung  The Siege of Troy  I took occasionmerely because I felt itto introduce an oblique compliment to Dr CHAPMAN which afterwards as  I understood was inserted with some handsome remarks in the OXFORD paper  The compliment was this I said SOLON was no enemy to pleasure He only condemned those fictitious representations which concealed the deformity of vice and gave countenance to lawless enjoyments He went one night to see one of these performances which THESPIS conducted When it was over he asked the comedian if he was not ashamed of himself  'What harm have I done'  said THESPIS  ''twas only in jest'    'true'  said SOLONbut approving vice in jest is the surest way to make it admired in earnest  In short I performed the three nights for which I had permissionand was granted at the pressing instance of many members of the university a  fourth  and I may truly say as to applause no man ever experienced hansomer encouragement The profit however was only what I have before mentioned  During my stay at OXFORD I became more intimate with Dr HAYESand as our conversations on  Music  were very frequent he could not help telling me what trouble he had been put to at different timesthough he had never seen meto defend my reputation against the malignity of the ignorant and the invidious These conversations finished with my making him a sort of half promise to put a stop to the tongue of envy by composing the proper exercise and taking the complicate degree of  Bachelor  and  Doctor  of MUSIC This promise however so given I fancy I shall not keep I despise envy too much to fear itand therefore cannot condescend to silence it As to the exercise it is composedandbe it known to the musical criticsthough it is a task infinitely more complex than any thing I had before doneI never set myself an easier lesson in my life so much less difficult is it to work by  method  than  fancy  As however the song of hope is a part of it one half of the kingdom will witness for me that melody and harmony may be blended and as I shall previous to my departure make a present of the overture to some of the first concertsparticularly those of LIVERPOOL MANCHESTER and LEEDSthe most rigid theorist shall be obliged to confessthat the first  sugue  I ever thought it worth my while to make is one of my best compositions for it does not wrong my ownestablished maximof never losing sight of melodyyet it extends and expatiates through all the wide  field of modulation If the cavillers take up this let them consider it merely as a whetby and by they shall have a full meal  At OXFORD I received a letter from a friend informing me that my little piece of  Harvest Home  had been performed and received with very great applause To corroborate this account I sent the next day for the  Morning Chronicle  where I found it spoken of in the highest terms Mr WOODFALL among other things having predicted it would become a popular favourite and I sincerely believe his words would have been verified had it been performed every night afterwards in the same state as on the  first  On the fourth however I saw it myself and I declare most solemnlythough as MAJOR STURGEON says  "I have seen some desperate duty"  I never witnessed so wanto  a mutilation I scarcely knew itand my friend who was with me and who gave me the above account assured me that all the alterations had been made since the first night I bore my disgrace like a philosopherand was not at all surprised when instead of getting a remittance for the profit of my benefit I received a letter informing me that there was a balance against me of  nine pounds  But to please managers who are not attached to you is a more ridiculous attempt than the man with his son and his jackass Thank Heaven I have now only the public to pleaseof which as a valuable individual I beg you will take your share and believe me  Your obliged friend C DIBDIN  Newark    Nov    LETTER XVIII  VARIOUS ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OPINIONS AND OBSERVATIONS  "  There lies honour  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I will not leave OXFORD without noticing the civility which in addition to that of Dr HAYES and the VICE CHANCELLOR I received from that fine hearty friendly character Mr JACKSON the bookseller nor must the great attention shewn me by that able artist Mr ROBERTS pass unsungwhose paintings and in particular his small whole lengths are remarkable for spirit expression good drawing and exact similitude No stronger instances of the latter quality in them can be given than the following circumstance When I was at WOLVERHAMPTON a gentleman came into the room and being musical chatted with me some minutes before the performance I thought I had met with him beforebut it turned out that I had seen only his portrait at Mr ROBERTS'sthat distance of time was at least three months and as I never saw either original or portrait more than once and that for a very short space of time the resemblance must have been not only correct but very striking indeed This gentleman's name is SPENCE and he is a student at the University Mr ROBERTS does not want my recommendationif he did I should strongly advise those who wish to preserve their likenesses and possess at the same time good paintings to apply to him  Before I set out for London I sent a letter of thanks to the VICE CHANCELLOR  which I sincerely wish I could remember as it would serve admirably well by way of contrast to one that will appear in the next letter which I kept a copy ofthe transaction that occasioned it having fixed in me a firm determination to publish this work  OXFORD is so well known that it will be necessary for me to say but little about it Every child knows that it has thirteen parish churches twenty colleges and five halls which being intermixed with the houses give it an air of superb magnificence not perhaps to be equalled in the world As to its  musical taste  I need not say more in its praise than that Dr HAYES is their professor of music The inns are in term time filled constantly with riotswhich render them very uncomfortable to strangers Nor can this be restrained The authority of the most powerful or the examples of the best man upon earthand it will be difficult to find out a better than Dr CHAPMANcan avail but little while fathers instead of a modest stipend sufficient to answer the purposes of a student send their sons to the University one would think to plunge them into extravagance and disqualify them for every studybut  profligacy  and  brutality  And now in my usual way must I break off to throw together some of those thoughts which have often struck me on this important subject The young gentlemen of the University have generally separate tutors I do not say the following remarks apply to every tutor but do they generally understood consider any thing but the pleasures of the pupil Nay are they not often commanded to do so Is not his vanity gratified Are not his wishes anticipated Is there an incentive to idleness a stimulative to dissipation but it is their study to procure Are misdemeanors to be investigatedthey wrack invention to find an excuse Is pleasure the wordthe tutor is the jolliest fellow in the throng In short would you teach your son to trample upon reason violate decorum destroy every social trace of virtue and to finishin his own languageknock down order give him a tutor that will pass muster among the rest if he be of any other description he will be hunted down with undeserved calumny till he shall be obliged either to take refuge in a school or behind the readingdesk  of a country curate And the mischief isit is so difficult to make a choice Sanctity is no more to be trusted than the grief of an actor which continues only till the curtain drops to make room for the farce that is to follow it Thus fools come in as large shoals from the University as knaves from church Your right collegian can give you vices of an hundred years standing a newcut to bring them into fashionbut as to books they are the same to him as drugs to an apothecaryboth are prescribed and both taken but neither the  physic  by the DOCTOR nor  letters  by the SCHOLAR A set of unintelligent terms serve the purpose of both and one administers to the body and the other to the mind while they trust to chance for the success of the operation  Of natural curiositiesI believe there are none at OXFORD Artificial ones manufactured there may be seen in many of the pulpits throughout the kingdom  Perhaps you will say I am somewhat too hardfor this should seem to imply that our universities produce nothing but dunces I allow which is a great deal that once in ten times they may turn out a man of tolerable abilitiestwo thirds of the remainder are but at best  Pedants  fellows who go over a whole librarybook by bookas faithfully as a MOTH but whoafter they have both  read  and  retained  every thinghave not sufficient taste to distinguish a single literary beauty The restas I have described aboveare either pretty fellows or jolly dogsa set of beings comparatively less obnoxious in proportion as they approach to insignificance  I returned to LONDON on Monday the twentyfirst of May exactly in timeas I mentioned in my last letterto see  Harvest Home  on the  fourth night  from which circumstance I as positively predicted its downfall as Mr WOODFALL had done its popularity That very evening I formedwhat I thought amounted to a resolution of drawing my pen no more for the stage but so much was I mistaken that three days afterwards I caught myself finishing a seene in  I think the best piece I have ever written But any one would have done the same The encouragement I had received from Mr HARRIS no man would have suspected to be trifling and two or three pieces purchased at a good price would not have been an uncomfortable circumstance upon a long voyage How fallacious however this dependance was will be shewn in its proper place  Little happened during my stay in town worthy noticeexcept many instances of friendship I received from Mr PRESTON in the Strand and that Dr HAYES who came up to the festival did me the kindness to dine with me on the king's birthday and caught me hard at work at my exercisefor my intention was pretty strong then to go for the degree for I was pleased with my work and thought it a pity to take so much pains for nothing Other pursuits however have since diverted me from itso there lies honourit will not stop the tide nor restrain the windstherefore I'll have none on'tYou will as readily believe it as that I am  With the most perfect truth C DIBDIN  Newark    Nov    LETTER XIX  AN AGREEABLE COMPANION IN A STAGE COACH  "  Thou hast seen a dog bark at a beggar  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  ON the seventh of June I quitted LONDON for CAMBRIDGE In the coach happened to be a gentleman of some medical consequence in the city who not only turned out a very agreeable companion but made some of the best general remarks I ever listened to These though I may avail myself of some of them in the course of my work I shall say nothing of here I cannot refrain however from giving his opinionwhich I earnestly requested as that subject came up among a number of othersconcerning the execution of DONNELLAN I could not withhold myself from reprobating in pretty strong terms the prejudgment in that businessthe rigour shewn from the benchwhere the prisoner should never want an advocate and in particular the remarkable circumstancethat the charge to the GRAND JURY  previous to the trial  contained the  very  words of the sentence of CONDEMNATION all of which I believe the public have but one opinion ofThis gentleman's sentiments of the matter as a physiciansetting aside all the nonsensical controversies that have happened concerning the quality of  laurel water  he very sensibly confined to this That poison of any kind could not effect death so instantaneouslythe shortest period between the swallowing of poison and the consequent death that he had ever heard of in all his practice  was nearly  four hours  and SIR THEODORE BOUGHTON is said to have died in less time than  one minute  In short said he if that phial contained any thing of DONNELLAN's invention which actually caused that sudden death sworn to by the mother he discovered what no other ever did Unless it was one of those secrets which Dr MEAD is said to have kept from the world lest knowing human depravity he might be the instrument of providing them with a novel opportunity of perpetrating the dictates of a cowardly and diabolical revenge As to Dr RETRAY's killing rats and dogs to prove he had been mistaken when he swore SIR THEODORE BOUGHTON was poisoned with arsenic we laughed at it as it deserved but when we came to consider that Dr HUNTER was pinned to a single question namely whether the deceased died of poison or notwhich no man could have positively answeredwe agreed in a sincere wish that the learned interpreter of the lawwho acted the part of judge and jury upon this occasionwas in his own mind clearly and fully convinced of the prisoner's guilt and so with that laudable and upright detestationwith which his lordship is well known to accelerate the extermination of murderershe resolved that the victim then in his power should not escape  I was unfortunate enough to lose this gentleman's company after we had travelled together about six and thirty miles On my arrival in CAMBRIDGE where I cannot refrain from noticing that though the coach from  Gray's Inn Lane  is bound to the  White Hart  yet the passengers will far every disagreeably if they are obliged as I was to stay all night As soon as I could the following morning I got into a lodging and began to make my preparations in form I delivered a letter to Dr RANDALL who begged to be excused from taking an active part in the business on account of his age and the resolution he had made not to concern himself but as little as possible with public matters I afterwards called on a gentleman of Trinity College to whom I had a very friendly and pressing letter from a man of fortune in townbut unluckily the gentleman was not then at CAMBRIDGE My next application was of course  to the VICE CHANCELLOR and as every other channel wasas the reader has seendammed up my only reliance was on the permission I had received from Dr CHAPMAN and some other documents which I put in my pocket for his inspection But as this interview and the result of it make too marking a part of my TOUR not to have every possible advantageI shall give so singular a transaction a letter by itself I have shewn in this letter a judicial cur in officein my next I shall give you the portrait of a clerical onebut all these are the foils that set off the brilliancy of true friendship and the value of sterling worthfor the knowledge of these kind and estimable qualities in you give me leave to assure you that I am  Thankfully Yours C DIBDIN  Newark    Nov    LETTER XX  SCRUPLES OF CONSCIENCE  "  Let the galled jade wince  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I have often wondered that in the common transactions of life men meet with such continual rudeness when civility is so cheap and so becoming If hackney coachmen and waiters made a point of using a little of this good quality they would find themselves richer and lead more comfortable lives But if rudeness be unpardonable in those we rule for heaven's sake what is it in those who rule us A man in a high and respectable situation can add nothing to his dignity so truly great as complacency and gentleness of manners Thus the VICE CHANCELLOR OF OXFORD who is an absolute monarch for the time beinglike a little Emperor of GERMANYdispenses his decrees with such impartial evenhanded justice and tender regard to his own honour and the susceptibility of individuals that a man must be selfcondemned before he punishes him and I will venture to say that if any consideration could induce a distinction in his conduct or carriage to any different descriptions of men who on various accounts have occasion to apply to him the benevolent affability which so eminently characterises him would be conspicuously extended to the most unfortunate  among them  I saw once a noble instance of this triumphant philanthropy in the conduct of the late Sir JOHN FIELDING A man was examined before him upon a charge of a highway robbery instituted by a gentleman of distinction who swore positively to every circumstance of the robbery yet could not identify the person In the course of the business the right honourable witness seemed extremely offended that Sir JOHN FIELDING should pay the prisoner so much respect and him as he thought so very littlefor which discontent he received the following rebuke  'I am heartily sorry that you are offended at my softening the rigour of justice with a little humanity The prisoner is entitled more to my attention than you arebecause he is unfortunate If he should be guilty the law is severe enough without any exaggeration on my part but if innocent how could I excuse myselfby adding insult to misfortune'  What then can be said of a VICE CHANCELLOR OF CAMBRIDGE who has equal power and whose haughty and imperious deportment sullen aspect and premature determination seemcontrary to all acknowledged justiceto suppose every man guilty till he is proved innocent Such a VICE CHANCELLOR must surely be unfit for his situation He must be uncandid ungenerous and unjust andwhat are terrible qualities in that high characterignorant and incapable of discrimination Lest it should be thought I had Dr ELLISON in view when I drew the above portrait I will entreat the reader to attend minutely to what passed during my interview with that gentlemanand afterwards in consequence of itand it will be plainly seen whether he meant any thing more than a faithful discharge of the duties of that office committed to his care  I had waited on Dr ELLISON who was not to be spoken withI therefore by way of breaking the ice entreated Mr WYNN who keeps a music shop to call and leave some of my bills That doneafter four visits to no purposeI was at length admitted and my memorywhich is pretty faithfulassures me what follows was the conversation that passed between us  'Sir I have the honour to introduce myself to youmy name is DIBDINI come to CAMBRIDGE with a view of offering the university a  little musical entertainment which has given very great satisfaction at several placesand in particular at OXFORDwhere with the VICE CHANCELLOR's permission I had the honour of performing with much reputation'  "Hayou had the VICE CHANCELLOR's permission there had you how do I know that"  'I assure you Sir upon my honour I had however as I am a perfect stranger you are certainly not to oblige me upon my bare assertiontherefore please to look at those letters'  I then produced the letter from Dr HAYES written to me at WORCESTER and that from Dr CHAPMAN to him which accompanied it  "Ahwellthis letter gives you leave to be surebut it does not say that your entertainment is such a one as ought to be delivered at a university"  'It is true Sir Dr CHAPMAN never saw the entertainment in question not even to this moment but he was kind enough to suppose I would not commit such an outrage on propriety or so far offend against the etiquette of that university of which he is such an ornament as to offer them any thing unworthy the patronage under which I had the honour to appear before them and to convince me he was of this opinion Mrs CHAPMAN and several ladies with her attended the performance nay Sir to shew you beyond contradiction that the amusement had the good opinion of the university in general here is a paragraph in the OXFORD paper announcing that at the particular request of many respectable members of the different colleges the VICE CHANCELLOR extended his permission in consequence of the satisfaction I had given'  "Oh the paragraph in the paper is nothing at alla man put a paragraph in the CAMBRIDGE paper the other day against meand it was all a lie"  'Sir Mr JACKSON who prints the OXFORD paper is a man of  probity  and  fortune  he idolizes the VICE CHANCELLORand could not be induced for any consideration to use his name to grace a falsity'  "Upon my word you speak very wellone may easily see by your conversation you have merit"  'I am obliged to you for your good opinion Sir'  "But you see the morals of the young  men are all in my care and as Dr CHAPMAN never saw the entertainment he may yet be imposed upon I have seen your bill and I own it seems to hold out something immoral Besides if you are a man of this reputation what can induce you to come strolling about the country"  'Sir I am going to INDIAand as I wish before my departure to say good bye to a generous public who have afforded me a long and liberal patronage'  "Why do you know any body at CAMBRIDGE"  'No Sir'    "Then it is plain the people here do not make up any part of that public to whom you are so much obliged consequently they have no right to be thanked Thus you see as you are rich enough to come with no other motive than mere gratitudewhy pay it where it is not due"  'Good God Sir am I obliged to be personally acquainted with all those who wish me well as a public man'  "Well Sir I don't know what to say to it It has always been my rule to give no person permission who is not recommended by somebody belonging to the university You say you know nobody"  'I brought with me a letter for Dr RANDALL Sir'  "Oh Dr RANDALL won't do"  'What kind of person must it be Sir'    "Why for instance a fellow commoner of one of the colleges"  'I have a letter to a gentleman so described in my pocketit is unsealedplease to read it Sirhe is unfortunately not at CAMBRIDGEbut you will readily believe that upon the strength of his friends recommendation he would otherwise have waited on you with pleasure'  "It does not signify Sirthe gentleman is not here to speak for himself and I cannot credit mere appearances"  'Sir had I known there would have been so many difficulties thrown in the way of a request which it would have done you no dishonour or discredit to grant I would not have given myself a moment's trouble about it'  "Oh Sir if you begin to talk of difficulties I have done"  'So would I Sir did I not feel myself a little hurt at being deprived by your suspicions of an opportunity of giving CAMBRIDGE an amusement that has been so followed at OXFORD'  "My suspicions Sir"  'Yes Sirfor you must suppose me a most impudent impostor after every  thing that has happened'  "Well but surelywhy you are not the Mr DIBDIN who composed the  Padlock  and such a number of  musical works  "  'I am Sirand I am sorry you could not prevail on yourself to believe it sooner'  "Whyreallythis to be sure alters the case"  'In short Sir as this conversation has imperceptible stolen on thus far I am determined you SHALL be convinced The DUKE OF GRAFTON as I take it is CHANCELLOR OF CAMBRIDGE and you are only VICE CHANCELLOR and I am sure I know a channel through which I can get you his GRACE's recommendation of me'  "Why now upon my word this is a strange mistakepray sit down"  'I beg to be excused Sir'  "I am sorry a constant rule which I prescribe myself in these cases should occasion such a misunderstanding You may perform Sir on Monday"  This being the very point I wanted to bring him to I abruptly wished him a good morning and he followed me to the door with many apologies of which I took no manner of notice As soon as I got home I sent him the following letter  To the Rev Dr ELLISTON  SIR  WHEN I did myself the honour in a letter to the VICE CHANCELLOR OF OXFORD to thank him for a similar favour to that for which I this day applied to you I could not help noticing that the  manner  of conferring a favour constitutedincomparably before all other considerationsits VALUE You Sirwith a vigilant zeal no doubt for the cause of morality have thought proper to disbelieve what that gentleman saw no rational cause to discredit yet let me assure you that the letters from Dr HAYES and Dr CHAPMAN were not forgeriesthe paragraph in the OXFORD paper was no fabrication to deceive youthe letter to Mr THOMPSON of Trinity College really was written by a man of fortuneand I declare that I did not in a single instance misrepresent or exaggerate any one circumstance Lest however  you should think this letter as well as the rest an imposition I hasten to the purpose for which it is written and inform you that I take the liberty to decline that permission you have thought proper so  very liberally  to grant  I am Sir c C DIBDIN  June    I must not quit this subject without observing that it is more than possible I went the wrong way to work This I know to be fact A certain mimic who had once some sort of lectures at CAMBRIDGE in which his great merit was an imitation of MEprocured a permission for his performance by giving the VICE CHANCELLOR's butlerI will not say what VICE CHANCELLOR  a guinea  Thus as it frequently happens in life was the  substance  neglected for the  shadow  If this  stings  "let the galled jade wince"  In which case you and I have free souls Adieu Believe me  Yours very truly C DIBDIN  Doncaster    Nov    LETTER XXI  A RACE AND A BADGERING  "  Young birds alone are caught with chaff  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  CAMBRIDGE having detained me a week to no purpose I was persuaded to try HUNTINGDON which place was said to have a very spirited neighbourhood LORD SANDWICH not being then at HINCHINBROOK none of the musical tribe would stir a peg without their first fiddleand having performed  one night  to an audience of about twentyfive who were not in the habit of following a leader I flattered myself by the satisfaction those few received a  second  would be worth trial But I had not considered that on that very evening MADAME MARA performed at CAMBRIDGE or I should not have been so absurd as to expect that any lover of  music  within twenty miles would lose the opportunity of hearing her I was so thinly attended that I would not performand the next day set off with a view of going to NORWICH I cannot refrain from mentioning a sensible remark of the MAYOR to whom as commanding officer I as usual applied  'Sir'  said he  'it is not in my power to give you permission on the contrary I am expressly ordered by the late proclamation as MAYOR of this town to prevent every exhibition not authorized by a regular licenceNow as according to the present laws there cannot be a licence to tolerate any sort of amusement at HUNTINGDON nor indeed at any other place more  than twentyone miles out of LONDON and as it is certainly unfair that we should be denied rational amusements I shall as long as my office continues take the liberty to make this distinction Whenever an entertainment presents itself that like yours promises to give pleasure without being immoral although I give no leave as a magistrateI will certainly as a man recommend it to the attention of my friends If therefore you should think proper to perform I dare say nobody will inform against you and if you wish for the Townhall the man who takes care of it will no doubt let you have it for a mere trifle'  I am sure you will pardon me for noticing this gentlemanlike conduct I shall in the course of this work go into a full description of the laws relative to public amusementsto which I am very competent having had as much public and private legal advice as any man  HUNTINGDONwhich gave birth to OLIVER CROMWELLis a pretty town It lies however on a flat and the prospect near it is remarkable for nothing but a number of handsome spires The road to CAMBRIDGE is very fine The hairdresser gave me a long account of the number of parishes it formerly had  'but alas Sir'  said he  'they are now dwindledand we have only four  church yards  three  spires  two  churches  and one PARSON'  When I came to NEWMARKET in my way to NORWICH upon hearing the races were to be the following week at IPSWICH I changed my design and went to that place I found it in glorious confusion and trying to get a lodging I discovered a  manaeuvre  the mention of which may serve as a caution to those who mean to visit any place in the  raceweek  The landlord of one of the principal inns had advertised his beds at a guinea apiece and fearing on account of the exorbitant demand that visitors should be induced to take lodgings he procured with great cunning and industry a promise from the other inhabitants that they would ask the same price What was the consequence  IPSWICH is very large and the strangers naturally said If we can get lodgings no cheaper at private houses than at inns we had better be where our horses can be taken care of Thus few private lodgings were letthe inns were fulland the landlords laughed at the credulity of their neighbours  At IPSWICH I gave my entertainment twice before I went to COLCHESTER and once at my return The two first times I was as well attended as considering the number of amusements that poured in from all quarters I had a right to expect The fourth night however was to make me large amends but like my dependences in general turned out a rotten oneAn unfortunate and truly ridiculous circumstance happened to give a fort of tacit umbrage to many of the company there It was this I was invited to sup with about eight of the leading gentlemen and as they had a ball that evening and it was very unlikely that these eight should sup away from the general meeting where as sort of stewards their presence seemed to be absolutely necessary I suspected some artifice in the business Now it is a rule with meas I was once under the unpleasant necessity of hinting to one of my auditorsthat when I am stuck up in my temporary orchestra and playing my tricks I am unconditionally at the devotion of the audience but before or after my performanceas there was never any thing either imperious or presuming in my deportment of which I am sure I should have witnesses enow were I to ask itI cannot consent to consider myself in an ineligible lightWhether this rule struck these gentlemen and ladies as false consequence improper pride or what I will not determine but certainly the invitation to supper meant nothing more than that I should relieve the  pipe  and  taber  by doing my utmostto  entertain the company  And here I cannot for the life of me avoid pausing to tell two stories of poor SHUTER  This child of humour was at a dinner one day in a promiscuous companyand as soon as the cloth was taken away one of them got up and  entreated as a particular favour he would begin to be comical  "God"  said SHUTER  "I forgot my fool's dressbut however I'll go and fetch it if you'll be my substitute till I return"  The man thought this very comical and declared he would SHUTER then took his hat and canewent awayand did not return at all  Another timea set of warm citizens who had been used to the company of BENNETan actor of very mediocre abilities at  Covent Garden Theatre  got SHUTER to a tavern in the cityNo man's intellects were ever stronger nor did any utter brighter sallies of wit and pleasantry At every good thing the gaping citizens were in raptures SHUTER could not conceive the reason of such  very  lavish praisestill at length hearing one of them exclaim  'Oh that's greatthat's charmingthat's so like BENNET'  He was immediately let into the secret BENNET was with them all that wit and humour could comprize and they had not the smallest idea of paying him an ill compliment by comparing him to their favourite But to return  Having given a pretty shrewd guess at what was going forward I went to the Coffeehousein BOOTS The gentleman who invited me was evidently disappointed at my appearanceand this confirmed my suspicionsI told himas the party was private and consisted only of gentlemenI had taken the liberty to come with no ceremony especially as I should be under the necessity of going to COLCHESTER early in the morning He hesitatedand we were joined in the Coffeeroom by other gentlemen through whose enquiries after supper the murder came out I immediately wished this gentleman a good nightsayingit was utterly impossible to mix with the company in that trimand gave a strong hint that I could not consent to be a performer any where but in my own entertainment The justice of my remark was admittedand I retired At my return from COLCHESTER this gentleman told me it was impossible to blame what I had done but that it  threw an universal gloom over the companyevery expectation was balked and they never passed so unpleasant an evening  This was not the only time The same trick was attempted to be played me at WORCESTER At ten o'clock at night a gentlemanin white gloves and without a hatcatched me busily writingwith a long beardand would fain have mebecause a lady whom he afterwards married took such a whim in her headgo with him to the assemblyroom to eat supper and sing catches and gleesI was obliged to tell him in a few short words that I could not think of any such thing and if I had not been convincedas it afterwards turned outthat every body disapproved of his conductbut what will not a hot pursuit after a large fortune make a man doI would have left WORCESTER the next morningbut I had the pleasure to find what I had done extremely approved of and though I had no more of that gentleman's company my numbers were not lessened by my refusal to comply with his caprice  Thus was I expected like SHUTER to be comical or jump over a stick at the word of command but I was determined to convince them I had not so much docility Besidesafter allthere might be some BENNET or other whose comic abilities I might not have been able to equal  How far the gentleman I here allude to had a share in the business I will not pretend to say I have given a faithful relation of itand as upon several occasions he was very attentive to methough there certainly was a blunder somewhereit would be ungenerous in me to suppose he meant any thing more than my interest I ought not  ab origine  to have been deceivedand a worthy baronet with whom I conversed on the subject at BURYand who was to have been of the partyagreed I had been disingenuously dealt with However  "as old birds are not caught with chaff"  I took carethough it affected my interest a littleit should not make me ridiculous I own I was hurt at itand in particular because it induced me to leave my kind friends near COLCHESTER so soon  Yours truly C DIBDIN  Wakefield    Nov    LETTER XXII  GREAT PAINS FOR LITTLE PROFIT  "  More cry than wool  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  TO COLCHESTER I postedand being recommended by the ingenious Mr MOOREwhose  clock  and other curiosities all the world has seen and wondered atto the  White Hart  I there received a hearty welcome toas he saidthe land of Oysters Baize and Eringo from Mr REYNOLDS who is known among his  superiors  by the title of  honest George  by his  equals  as a kind friend and AGREEABLE COMPANIONand among his  inferiors  as a  generous  and  liberal benefactor  Indeed both he and his son in understanding and demeanour give you an impression of something considerably above innkeepers He shook his head at the idea of a musical entertainment at COLCHESTERbut as the assemblyroom was in his house I resolved to try it My success turned out neither good nor bad and he and I settled the matter as men should do who mean fairly by each other One circumstance however rendered my jaunt to COLCHESTER very pleasurable A gentleman who has every thing within himself that can constitute the enjoyments of a countrylife in the truest and most delectable stile laid himself out with the unaffected and hearty kindness of old English hospitality to charm away every moment of my time Were I to mention every particular of his flattering partiality in terms it deserves I must invent  new onesas no idea but the kind attention of this gentleman and the benevolence of his family of love engrossed meI shall only say of COLCHESTERthat the applause was excessivethe profit scarcely any thing  On my return to IPSWICH my night was spoiled by the intervention of that little pique which I have so fully mentioned in my last letter I therefore got away to BURY ST EDMUNDS at which place as I passed through in my way to IPSWICHas the players call itI  took the town  that is to say made my enquiries and saw how the land lay Before I sit myself down at BURY I shall speak of some characters at IPSWICH Among the foremost I anxiously seize the first opportunity in my life of noticing two members of the law of liberal and gentlemanlike mannersand that so extraordinary an event may be fully proclaimed whether these gentlemen will or nottheir names are Mr KILDERBEE and Mr SQUIRES  I assure the reader I shall have in the course of the work more characters of this description and they shall be placed among my catalogue of WONDERS    The fashionable and friendly Mr TROTMAN certainly strove to serve me as industriously as ever the BUSY BODY did to serve Sir GEORGE AIRY and notwithstanding it has been said the last storm was of his  brewing  yet I really would try my hand at his panegyrick if my pen was not restrained every time the idea comes across me by a recollection of the following lines in PRIOR  "To John I owe great obligation  "But John unhappily thought fit  "To publish it to all the nation  "Sure John and I are more than quit"  Nor must I forget that son of LINNEAS Dr COYTE who hadwhen he did me the honour to conduct me to his botanic plantationarrived to such a pitch of perfection in improving upon nature as to deprive the sun of the power of maturing a  Magnolia  for a whole fortnight that it might bloom for the gratification of his friends in the race week The father of this gentleman is said to have been one of the first botanists in Europe  I shall also speak of another gentleman who repeatedly expressed a very strong desire to be present at my entertainment but a foreignerwhich too often happensattracted him with such magnetic force that in spight of his own wishes he had not the power to turn from the charm that fascinated him  But last  "though not least"  I shall speak of PUNCHARD and JERMYN whose kindness was fraught with such unaffected attention that it will not easily be erased from my remembrance One thing in particular marked a strong desire to please which is one of the best recommendations of a tradesman though heaven knows the trifle I paid them was scarcely worth an acknowledgment The receipt was thus worded  "Received the contents of this billwith thanks"  I have before expressed my surprise that civility being so cheap an accommodation should be so little attended to It is indeed so winning that it insures attention to the meanest trifles A good introduction does wonders and though an insinuating prologue cannot save a bad play it may soften considerably the rigour of its sate Is not a fine lady cheated by a shopkeeper with all the willingness in the world if he compliments her person while he palms on her his damaged goods Appearancelike the first blow in boxingis half the battle What a figure would a judge look if he were to try a cause in a black bob wig and a pair of jack boots I was once witness to a farmer's abusing a pair of young spruce unwigged counsellors  for spoiling his ground in the afternoon in whose presence he hadon a trial in the morningtrembled from head to foot But to settle my account with COLCHESTER and IPSWICH  Both of these places seem to have been formerly of consequence but are now greatly declined The manufactory of baize as well as most of our staple commerce is getting north A stronger proof of which cannot be given than that LIVERPOOL is insensibly drawing away the trade of BRISTOL and HULL all the coasting business except YARMOUTH from IPSWICH to SALTFLEETand thus it will be found inland Manufactories that begin about the center of the kingdom push on to the north tillhaving taken up their residence in Yorkshirethey expand to the east and west but particularly the east in a most astonishing way Thus from LEEDS to LIVERPOOLthrough BRADFORD HALIFAX ROCHDALE MANCHESTER WARRINGTON and PRESTONthe population is wonderful The workmen are like so many ants employed about their heaps but they are so different from those in London that while the ants of the north labour for the  general benefit  the other pismires work hard for the GENERAL CONFUSION  As for the innsthe  White Hart  at COLCHESTER is one of the best in England It is large handsome and convenient and has admirable accommodations I was witness to Mr REYNOLD's sending outwith some company who had been to pay a visit to Mr RIGBYtwo and twenty pair of horses in one morning I cannot so correctly speak as to the inns of IPSWICH for when I was there they were all in confusion and it was first come first served Provision seemed to be very good and the soles they get from ALDBOROUGH are incomparable  I acknowledge the receipt of your letter and thank you for your remarks It is true I have yet said nothing of the country as to cultivation It must have been owing to a want of diversity in the subject The face of  nature at the time I am recording appeared to me like a serene day fair and full of smiles The only change was from arable to meadow land and from meadow to arable and this you may distinguish with your eyes shutfor  "the ripe harvest of the newmown hay gave it a sweet and pleasing odour"  Pray do not fail to give me your sentiments fully as I assure you nothing can give me more pleasure than the attention you are pleased to pay  Your very thankful friend C DIBDIN  Wakefield    Nov    LETTER XXIII  ADVENTURE UPON ADVENTURE  "  I ne'er sustain'd the like disgrace before  "  By this good light  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  HAVING sat myself down in a lodging at BURY I paid my respects as usual to the  commandant  who is there called THE ALDERMANthe rest of the magistracy being twelve feoffees This gentleman made not the smallest objection except to the use of the Guildhall which was a part of my request and this he could not according to constant usage grant without the consent obtained in writing of the feoffees I asked him which among them was the most musical and he answered Dr NORFORD which intelligence was so true that having waited on that gentleman I found him surrounded with friends who were listening to a morning concert He came to me into the halland upon hearing my name insisted on my entering the room where the IPSWICH gentleman and the foreigner mentioned in my last letter made a part of the company Some instrumental things were performed and I was at length requested to play a lesson on the  piano forte  I felt all the disadvantage of having no  foreign attraction  and therefore knew that I stood but little chance of being ranked with my present competitors unless I could in some arch way turn the tables I therefore said I thought a song would be a kind of relief to what had gone before and played  Pomposo  which  hit exactly as I wished it should This circumstancefor you know I love illustrationsbrings another to my mind which also told very strongly in this way  I was asked to dine at one of Mr Fox's annual meetings were there were about two hundred Westminster electors Before I gave my consent I stipulated with my friend that I should not be asked to sing This indulgence he said he could insure me but upon reflection I placed very little reliance on the promise I therefore was prepared with my famous  Jew's song  which will be found in  The Readings  and it is not in the power of language to describe how wonderfully well it hit That sine veteran MACKLIN was in raptures and I sincerely believe it was the sole cause of his burning his wig which made such a noise the next day in the newspapers But to return to BURY  The consent I wanted was easily obtainedand in my life I never experienced handsomer or politer treatment One reverend gentleman however was scrupulousbut it is a becoming thing for the clergy to be conscienciousand though the Rev Dr WOOLASTON's readiness to forward a rational amusement which he did me the honour to attend and highly approve had certainly nothing reprehensible in it the other reverend doctor was surely under no obligation to do the same 'Tis true if others had imitated this wonderfully sagacious prudent and wary forecast BURY would have been deprived of what they were so kind as to think a pleasure What then Prevention is a wise thing and upon the same principlea little more rigidly exacted to be surethat it is better to let  twenty  guilty persons escape than that  one  suffer innocentlyso the suppression of fifty harmless amusements is meritorious rather than run the smallest risk of giving encouragement to vice and immorality  After the performance was overwhich I had advertised but for one nightI was obliged to promise a repetition of it and as I wished very much to go  to NORWICH before the players could get there I appointed a late day in the following week and packed off I have really had the luck of meeting with friendly printers Mr STEVENSON the valuable and worthy partner of Mr CROUSE shewed me a thousand civilities Among the rest his friendly recommendation to YARMOUTH rubbed off all difficulties in the way of my performing thereyet would it be injustice to Messrs DOWNES and MARCH not to say that their attention for the short time I remained at YARMOUTH was very gentlemanlike and perfectly liberal But let me first speak of NORWICH On the first nightthough I addressed upwards of an hundred letters to the principal peopleI had only five persons I did not perform in course and indeed I was doubtful whether I should give them the trouble or myself the expence of another night Having however understood that I was there also considered as an impostor I inserted a paragraph in the bill which I expected would have its effect and indeed I was stimulated to this by the very handsome conduct of a gentleman present on the first night who said every thing he could think of to palliate the matter I drove him however into a corner by saying that I was very willing to stand or fall by the merit of the entertainment and it would give me particular pleasure if they would pitch upon twelve critics who should be men of real understanding to report the matter and let it be decided upon according to their judgment He answered that it was a fair offer but that it never could be settled for there was not any such number as twelve critics in NORWICH At the same time he suggested that the success might be betterthat the number of nights I had advertised I ought to consider as a compact with the public This last argument roused me I determined to perform every night I had engaged for at all adventures I did so and though no opportunity was neglected and those who attended were greatly pleasedaccording to the Irishman  I gained a loss  Enough therefore of NORWICH at which place howeveras at almost every otherI found something to counterbalance my disappointments The attention and civility of my friend STEVENSON made me large amends for the vapid unmeaning languor that pervaded the place itself not but I have many acknowledgments  to pay those who attended the performancefor they one and all agreed that I could not in painting my TOUR throw NORWICH too much into the back ground  At YARMOUTH I had two nights whichthough not  numerous  were  brilliant  There is a gentleman at YARMOUTH to whom the fashionable people look upand well they mayas the arbiter of their amusements His attention to mecould I conceive I really merited itmight make me vain of myself indeed To shew however that nothing can win me on a pecuniary score be it known I rather lost than gained at YARMOUTH But Dr COOPER's anxiety on that accounthis solicitude for my accommodationhis handsome wellbred conduct gave me so exalted an opinion of him that I was not at all surprised when Mr ROUPE to whom he is a sort of patron without his own knowledgefor he confers to oblige himself assured me that there is not a human mind fraught with more worth or disinterested benevolence And here Mr ROUPE must forgive me if in order to illustrate his and my position I speak a little of his own comfortable situation  This gentleman possessed a competent fortune subject to alienation at the death of a relationwhich relation being dead he is deprived of it till the decease of another Upon his loss by the advice of his friendsand Dr COOPER at the head of them he made what had been his amusement his profession and having an admirable musical turn he is now organist and has all the principal teaching of YARMOUTH I never had the pleasure of hearing him play but have heard a great account of his performance I however chatted with him some hours on music and he seems to be of my own sentiments He has a strong fancy and despises every  rule  that is not reconcileable to REASONMay he long be happy which there is little fear of for through the benignant influence of Dr COOPER and his own mild and amiable manners he feels himself as independent and is as much respected as when he basked in the sunshine of fortune and had no right to consider himself as a professional man  You must understand that I performed at NORWICH and YARMOUTH alternatelywhich circumstance occasioned the appearance of a paragraph in the BURY paper saying that it was a wonderful thingsetting aside all considerations of the merit of the performancethat Mr DIBDIN should be able  at all  to perform an amusement in which he sung twenty four songs and delivered an adequate quantity of speaking on  Monday  at NORWICH  Tuesday  at YARMOUTH  Wednesday  at NORWICH  Thursday  at YARMOUTH  Friday  at NORWICHand  Saturday  at BURY This circumstance however would have been attended with more pleasurable consequences to me if every one of these nights had been equal to the last which I seriously declare was more than the other five put together  NORWICH is a large citybut the streets are so narrow and so alike that a man would sooner learn to be his own pilot in LONDON than in that place There are so  few spires  in NORWICH that the view of the town and cathedral from the YARMOUTH road across the river has a most beautiful and picturesque effect Not so very striking as that bird'seyeview of BRISTOL from  Cliffden Hill  but neat and well grouped The streets of YARMOUTH are yet narrower than those of NORWICH but the spaciousness of the  Quay  makes handsome amends The first has all the heavy stupidity of a city where the manufactory is on the decline and the other the sprightliness of increasing trade varied by an influx of commodities from every part of the world I never beheld such a wonderful scene as the prodigious fine large rich fields of corn exhibited for a stretch of eight miles together between NORWICH and YARMOUTHand yet go where you would the farmers grumbled but it has been well observed that Englishmen are never rolling in wealth so much as when they complain of the weight of taxes and the impending ruin of the nation  Yours Most cordially C DIBDIN  Halifax    Dec    LETTER XXIV  A DISAPPOINTMENT  "  But 'tis a plain proof the world is all alike  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  AT my return from NORWICH to BURY which was on the last day of the assize week  Saturday July  I found every thing prepared for my performance at which a very splendid audience attended and among them one of the learned judges The applause was prodigious and never did better humour prevail in an assembly I felt myself however rather awkward at having announced the  "wolf who had been a lawyer"  I intimated this ridiculous distress to a gentleman who sat near me and the subject so got about that no member of the law went unconsulted and it was resolved  nem con  that I should cut at the lawyers You will find the passage in  The Readings  My feelings however were too prophetic for though many of the gentlemenparticularly him I consulted and the judgeenjoyed the satire yet were there many chopfallen on the occasion I mention this circumstance to support that constant opinion I have ever broached that in the practice of the law there are so many temptations to knavery that every lawyer who does not feel a severity of this kind as a positive reproach to himself must be hurt at having been bred up to a profession that stigmatizes ninetenths of his brethren  On Sunday I set out for WORCESTER and on the following Tuesday arrived there I have mentioned that before I left this place I made a promise to return to it and I now put myself to the expence of travelling post one hundred and fortynine miles to keep my word Having at BURY purchased Mr PATERSON's Travelling Dictionary I shall now begin to point out a few of its errors He says from BURY to WORCESTER is miles and his mistake originates from calling it miles from AULCESTER to WORCESTER whereas it is From AULCESTER to DROITWICH is and from thence to WORCESTER He is wrong a single mile in three other places which makes the distance in all miles from BURY to WORCESTER  My going this long journey was the more inconvenient having received a letter at BURY telling me that a gentleman at HULL and BEVERLY could accommodate me with a room and had no doubt of my doing extremely well at those townsbut of these places in their turn I was surprised to find a much colder reception at WORCESTER than formerly Except from one or two friends I never experienced more  milk and water  treatment in my life I advertised my entertainment however and was tolerably attended  "  Very tolerably  "  as Tester says and I sincerely believe had it not been for the interference of a friend I must have used the word INTOLERABLY To this gentleman who is no other than T S Esq I shall beg leave to say that if he meant his friendship and attention to my interest should finish where it apparently hasGod forbid I should load him with more trouble than he is willing to suffer So far from itI here in the face of the world acquit him of any intentions in relation to me but those of serving obliging and pleasing me and should it so happen that neither upon paper nor any other way we again exchange a single word my wishes towards him are may he enjoy a long life of health happiness and prosperity And I hope he retains so much of his former good wishes for me as to return an equal portion of esteem with equal sincerity  My success at WORCESTER was little worth the pains I took to get at it Dr EVANS the  archdeacon  who was very partial to the entertainment said my reception was a reproach to the place and really as they diverted my course in a most expensive and inconvenient way it would have been but handsome to have let me known in time that they had changed their mind or have paid me some attention when I did come I will not quit this subject without speaking of that friendly and goodnatured creature Mr SMART who I sincerely believe was as anxious for my success as myself Nor must I leave DIGLEY unsungthe heartiness of Mr PEACH its ownernor the beauties of that charming place watered by the Severn and bounded with a view of  Malvernhills  Mr SHENSTONE would presently have knocked you off half a dozen stanzas on this subject wherein he would have told you in verse that goes  "trippingly o'er the tongue"  that the hills are blue at a distance more distinct when nearthat the river has the property of reflection and that you may see in it imperfect trees standing on their headswith many more poetically selfevident images I once parodied  "My banks are all furnish'd with bees"  The first verse ran thus  My banks are all furnish'd with bees  Quickset Hedges  my  fences  adorn  My  woods  are all crowded with  trees  And my  fields  yellow over with  corn  I seldom have found any  tares  Of such use are my  harrow  and  plough    In my  orchards  grow  apples  and  pears  In my  dairy  there's  milk from the cow  In this manner one might I should suppose run on without any great stretch of difficulty till all the wonderful variety in the whole round of rural objects were enumerated  I recollect something like the following in a French author though I cannot at this moment tell who An old fellow is buying an estate and the seller puffs it off in all the flowery descriptive extravagance of an auctioneer's advertisement To which this is the answer 'Tis in verse and I have imitated it  "If for seven years you were to chatter  "'Tis hills and dales and woods and water  "All have their whims and to tell mine t'ye  "  One  country seenone has seen  ninety  Yetlet me not be profaneSHENSTONE's  eclogues and many other of his things have great poetic sweetnessbut having an inveterate aversion to insipidity I never could feel any other sensation than drowsiness at that famous ballad which is said to contain all the beauties of pastoral poetry But this will always be the waythe generality of mankind give an author credit for what in all probability he considered in the light of an insignificant triflesuch as the ballad abovementionedwhile his higherfinished and more beautiful workssuch as the school mistressis little known and less tasted But there is always this comfortmen of real taste will separate the gold from the alloy the applause of one of whom will outweigh a whole crowd of inferior critics  I must not quit WORCESTER without mentioning a most singular and extraordinary instance of the falsity of that vulgar positionthat fortune is inattentive to virtue There is a gentleman I would name if I did not fear to wound his well known modesty who made his fortune by the exercise of that one single virtue  forbearance  I do not mean that he has not all the rest in as great perfectionbut this happened to be put most to the trial And to shew that I am determined whenever I have an opportunity to celebrate the virtues of professional men with the same willingness as any other description this gentleman was originally nothing else than a musiciana mere thrummer of wire and a scraper of catgut He taught a young lady who fell in love with him and even went so far as to propose an elopement Did he think you give way to the tender impulse and while his heart beat high snatch sweet occasion and become happy No such thing  "Oh fie  miss"  was all he was heard to utter Having finished this laconic reproach he left the disappointed lovesick fair one and sought her fatherwhenfirst stipulating that the young lady should not be ill treatedhe minutely acquainted him To do which it seems he was obliged to relate a tale that might be called the history of the Sabines inverted with his daughter's shocking violation of her duty What was the consequence This amiable young man's unheardof prudence saved the family the daughter became prudent by despising the man she had courted was married soon after to one of equal birth and I hope equal impetuosity the father prudently rewarded the author of his domestic happiness and that author prudently put the reward in his pocket After this our musical Joseph fell in love himselfbut with his usual patience and forbearance he determined that time alone should prove whether the object of his affection was worthy of it The lady however being a little in the stile of the othernot quite of that passive temper which contents itself with  imaginary  blisswas first uneasyafterwards  unhappy  then ILLand at length DIEDOur mirror of prudence having lost a fortune by her had nothing for it but to console the mamma He considered himself as her sonshe considered herself as his motherand that nothing might be left undone to confirm this ideal consanguinity she died and left him all she was worthwhich turned out to be no trifle  Is there a fortunehunter who reads this but will in future change his batteryand cease to tear forward children from the arms of indulgent parents sinceby imitating the excellent example before themthe fortunewhich is always the objectmay be gained without the loss of honour orwhich is a more material considerationthe possession of a wife  So much for WORCESTERwhere you see after all I was shabbily treated  "But 'tis a plain proof the world is all alike"  and indeed I know not which was most to blamethey for promising or I for believing  If I had properly reflected I might have known it was the whim of the moment and would naturally subside I should be sorry if there was not more stability in my assuring you that I am  With great truth Most heartily Yours C DIBDIN  Wakefield    Dec    LETTER XXV  A CONSOLATION  "  In one great blessing all her bounty send  "  That I may never lose so dear a friend  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  FROM WORCESTERhaving been joined by an intimate and valuable friendI steered my course on the eleventh of August for GLOUCESTER BRISTOL and MONMOUTH my planwhile he should remain with mebeing to make the matter a mutual intercourse of business and call at those places that might be most convenient to both Nothing in  my  way was to be done at GLOUCESTERfor though the gloom of the bankruptcies before mentioned was worn off yet the place looked as melancholy as ever we therefore proceeded to BRISTOL spent three or four happy days with my friend BOYTON and passed on from thence to MONMOUTH being the first place where I intended to display my standard  The current account of places remains unsettled ever since NORWICH BURY which is the picture of cheerfulness consiststogether with its vicinityof people who seem determined to be happy The seats of Mr SYMONDS Sir CHARLES BUNBURY Sir CHARLES DAVERS and many others most charmingly enliven every morning ride and its proximity to NEWMARKET  occasions frequent visits from many people of the first distinction The cornmarket alone gives you a very respectable idea of the place Of the inns the  Bell  is a remarkable good oneif civility good cheer and a reasonable charge are the right distinctions If you would meet with the reverse in every respect go to the  Angel  My journey from BURY to WORCESTER was performed in so short a time that it would be a farce to talk of making any material observations The roads are charming from CAMBRIDGE to WILLINGBOROUGH and then very indifferent till you get four miles beyond WARWICK in the way to STRATFORDUPONAVON afterwards they are good all the way to WORCESTER I promised to speak of the  White Lion  at STRATFORD and common justice obliges me to say that the insolence of the people who keep it exceeds all example I should pass by the contempt with which they treat travellers in a stage coachwhich is hard by the way for they must go there or nowhereand also their wanting to put me into a return chaise and make me pay full price for it All this is in the way of business But when you are in a hurry to have the very worst horses picked out and be told  "that the others are for your betters and you may have them or none"  though they do not know youand if they did your betters do not pay a farthing moreis a species of contemptuous impudence that I hope will by somebody more competent than myself be taken down I have a great deal more of this sort of conduct to complain of and I shall seriously advise the respectable inhabitants of capital townsfor at STRATFORD I know not if it would be worth whilefor their own private benefit for the benefit of those who in visits of business to them pamper the pride and fatten these insufferable innkeepers and for the benefit of the public in general to imitate the spirit of the DUKE OF NORFOLK and as completely curb the haughty impertinence of these servants out of liverywhich in general they areas he hasas far as its influence extendsby building the  Tontine  at SHEFFIELD and placing in it a man whose solicitude for the convenience of his guests  should be quoted as a precedent for every one in his situation The ground from WORCESTER to BRISTOL I have gone over already I promised on my return to give an account of the musical taste of BRISTOLbut upon the most diligent enquiry I do not find they have any at all The road is all the way delightful and from TEWKSBURY to GLOUCESTER remarkably so It wanted nothing but a few scattered Romish chapels to have finished subjects for the pencil of CLAUDE From BRISTOL we crossed the Severn in a dung barge and proceeded to CHEPSTOWwhere we were offered our choice either to stay or have four horses to take us on and all this because the landlord of the other inn was just become a bankrupt Let me caution all travellers to make any shift rather than submit to be drawn by four horses They make no more expedition than twoand exclusive of the expence in themselves postillions ostlers and turnpikes you have a great deal of difficulty to shake them off again and your bill is in proportion to your  oetelage  These four horses brought us very slowlyfor which I was obliged to themover one of the most uncommonly beautiful hills that can be imaginedthe whole country every where abundantly rich with cornto MONMOUTH where for the present I shall bid you adieuassuring you that I am ever  And very truly Yours C DIBDIN  Sheffield    Dec    LETTER XXVI  A DISSERTATION ON CITIES  "  All is not gold that glitters  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  MONMOUTH was not worth a printer To make my intentions known therefore was a matter of no small difficulty A few respectful letters however to the principal inhabitants of the town and its vicinity did the business pretty well and I was tolerably attended a first night August and much better a second and as a general good humour and inclination to receive pleasure was the predominant sensation I felt almost as happy as if the advantage had been equal to the applause  I must not pass by some particular civilities that I received at MONMOUTH The Rev Dr DAVIS who was then the  Mayor  paid me very great attention andwhat made it more welcome to meit was very much in the stile of Dr COOPER of YARMOUTH For this kindness I then requested him privatelyand do now publiclyto receive my thanks Nor will I have the ingratitude to forget the anxious heartiness of my good friend OWEN TUDOR the bookseller who though not a  printer  was so good a  publisher  upon this occasion that much more intelligence was received thro' his kind assiduity than I am sure would have been conveyed by means of hand bills I left himand may he long continue socomfortable in himself  beloved by his neighbours and surrounded by that best of happinessdomestic felicity In fine I gave and received great satisfaction at MONMOUTH but as it is the lot of human beings to do nothing perfect I understand there is one gentleman for whose castigation I was supposed to have written the business of inventing quotations Nay some went so far as to say he will never be able to  invent  another  undoubted  fact as long as he lives If this be the case how unfortunate am I in having deprived a good storyteller of the greatest embellishment his talents can derive advantage from Should it be so I can only saywhich I entreat the gentleman if he read this to believethat it was written many months before I had the pleasure of his company at my readings and always highly approved as a  devilish good thing  From MONMOUTHwhich though an  ancient  town is a very  sprightly  onejust as a reasonable old man MACKLIN for instance in spight of his years resolves to be merrywe jogged on to  stupid  HEREFORD I have made this remark in my TOUR that the cities in generalas I say of the Dominosare  "grave elegant genteel and  stupid  "  to which if I was to add poor and proud the phrase I think would apply pretty well For if we except BRISTOL which being a seaport is naturally a busy and industrious placeWORCESTER which has a manufactory for gloves and porcelaintho' both are on the declineit is impossible to conceive any thing so phlegmatic and insensible as are the rest of the cities I have seen Thus shall I always say  stupid  HEREFORD  melancholy  LICHFIELD  pitiful  LINCOLN and  frothy  YORK This last place however being the LONDON of the  North  has exactly as much of it as a  shadow  has of a  substance  and upon the strength of this it presumes to be courtly and make promises whichlike the nonsense of a Frenchmanare PLEASING and  mean nothing  They buoy you up like an air jacket but the smallest inleteven a single pin holecan evaporate the air and down you go They will take care to promise nothing  but trifles and even those they take as good care not to keep  This brings to my mind an anecdote of a POOR PLAYER who had run up an alehouse score to the enormous extent of  two shillings  for which he had been so often dunned that he kept away from the house One day meeting the LANDLORD and being closely importuned to satisfy him this strolling ROSCIUS assured him that he might depend in the course of the week on being paid in some shape or anotherShapesaid the LANDLORDwell I think I'll take your word this time butharkeepray let it be as much in the shape of  two shillings as you can  I am however not yet at YORK therefore I may as well keep what I have to say of that place till I get there I shall nevertheless so far digress as to finish my remarks on cities  Some have averred that this vapidness is owing to the Cathedral which nurtures so many  drones  as to make all the rest of the hive lazy I hope this assertion is more invidious than true I have literally speaking had no opportunity at the four places above mentioned of taking personal cognizance of this fact At HEREFORD I did not perform or if I had their cathedral had just tumbled down and of courselike rats which never fail to leave a sinking shipthe black gentlemen were sheltered in some safer asylum I could not refrain from remarking that though the  church  lay in ruins the  chapterhouse  stood smiling at the dangerall the rentrolls tythes and commutations were safeas safe as the iron chest of a miser who has insured his housewhich defies the spreading flames and keeps its sterling value in security though buried under a load of rubbish  At LICHFIELD they were providentially repairing their cathedral lest unable to bear the ravages of time it should also tumble downthe clergy therefore were again absent upon furlough  At LINCOLN indeed where the cathedral seems to have the stability of a rock and yet the lightness of a temple built with cards the clerical gentlemen seemed to be on full duty And here though nothing but my compact to  speak the truth should force it from me I cannot help saying that the above remark obtained a littlebut this I shall speak to particularly when I arrive at LINCOLN  At YORK whose stately and majestic minster looks magnificently stupendous at a distance and when you are near it as petite as the Lord's prayer the creed and ten commandments stuffed into a walnut shell I know nothing more of the clergy than that their situations are generally sinecures and that whether their cathedral stand or fallwhich latter there is no great probability ofthey may be absent when they please I know however a prebend of YORK whom my heart warms to think of But of this hereafter  As to NORWICH disgust was my predominant passion and therefore like the father who would not disinherit his son because he was angry with him I will pass by that subject I shall also for the present have done with all other conjectures concerning the clergy and content myself with offering my own observations relative to cities which are that having in general no manufactory or other public object to engross their attention they are divided into people of tolerable fortunes small fortunes a few adventurersby way of  Cicesbeos  to the wives and gallants to the daughtersand the remainder are such tradesmen as furnish the necessaries of life and pick up a livelihood by the expenditure of the money circulated by those before described The attornies and medical gentlemen are in number according to the size of the place A tolerable large city will maintain youabout thirty of the first and fifteen of the latter so much dearer in this country is property than health  Dearer paid forIn every trifling village there are three or four decent houses which you may be assured belong to the parson the apothecary and the lawyerIt has been a remark that when one LAWYER cannot live in a place  two  CAN for in that case if the people are peaceably disposed one can  provoke  and the other  palliate  Over all these of course are placed the clergy who can certainly give  a sort of  Ton  to the place and if they ever happenwhich all the world knows is very rareeither to be ignorant overbearing or void of taste these peculiar qualities will be as surely predominant in their influence on the rest  and indeed ought  even as the whistle of the shepherd brings the sheep into the fold  Thus you see how I throw my ideas about at random which indeed is all that can be expected of me for manners and men can no more be developed by a cursory view than can a single glance determine the colour of a  cameleon  which must have shade and sunshine night and day and every other adventitious opportunity to display its different hues and after all so blind is human judgment that it will be impossible to fix on that particular shade that is proper to it  "All is not gold that glitters"  says the proverb Heaven knows my professions in no way can glitter if they could they would wear nothing but the sober appearance of truth when I assure you that I am  Most sincerely Yours C DIBDIN  Sheffield    Jan    LETTER XXVII  PLEASURE THE RESULT OF REFLECTION  "  When I consider the heavens and the works of thy fingers  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  YOU ask me when I mean to speak of music and hint that my observations on poetry painting the theatre and other matters might be well intermingled with the narrative of my TOUR I thank you for saying exactly what you feel as you read my remarks I have not been unmindful of any of these subjects but I shall have so much loose ground to run over for three or four letters to come that I would willingly shake it off my heels before I come into the company of men of science and genius In short I shall not begin my critical attack till I get farther on my journey for to give you a pun in the place of a better phrase one cannot be too far  north  for them  From HEREFORD I went to LEOMINSTER where I was told the inhabitants were very anxious to see me Mr PENE the organistto whose civility I am greatly indebtedtook much pains for me previous to my arrival and I had one very decent night The old stupid objection however took place I was an impostorand my performance was to be watched very narrowlymy audience were so much entertained however that they encored nine songs  Nevertheless Mr EVANS a  clergyman  proposed to Mr GEARY a  surgeon  a bet of ten guineas that I was an impostor The wager was accepted and Mr KIRKMAN a  country 'squire  was to decide between them This last mentioned gentleman very gravely determined  "that to be sure of all the impostors that ever lived I was the cleverestbut that certainly I was not Mr DIBDIN whom he knew perfectly wellthat not long before he had been  publicly  in his company and heard him sing several jolly songsand that he was  a tall thin man  and  wore a wig  "  Mr GEARY having lost his wager query whether he should not have appealed to me as a court of equity or indeed when this TOUR shall come out may it not be considered such strong legal evidence as may entitle Mr GEARY to the recovery of his moneynay more to a remedy through the medium of that act which makes it felony to obtain money by false pretences for it was certainly a false pretence in Mr KIRKMAN to say he had been publicly in my company Had it so happened I must have known itfor his person could not have been mistaken being remarkably like a ninepin with the addition of sins These premises therefore duly weighed and considered I would advise Mr EVANS to refund the money and Mr KIRKMAN to give a handsome treatwhich he seems very fond ofand pledge himself over the first pint bumper neverin imitation of the longeared gentlemento describe the  roaring of a lion  lest by exerting his own voice he discover the  braying of an ass  From LEOMINSTER we went to that pretty cleanlooking town LUDLOWwhose appearance from the distance of two mileswith the church in the center towering above the housesforms as picturesque a  coup d'oeul  as imagination can conceive  At LUDLOW I would not perform because the players were there I shall not so far lift Mr MILLAR their manager into consequence as to make him a party in this TOUR nor shall I pay the reader so ill a compliment as to relate the particulars of a low contemptible plot whichas every thing founded  in falsity oughtrecoiled and severely wounded the above pretty gentleman its contriver  "A lion preys not upon carcases"  out of pityfor I found by some conversation with one of the magistrates that the story had made him as contemptible at LUDLOW as at WORCESTER We dined and went on to BRIDGENORTH which place and COALBROOK DALE we had a great desire to see As nothing but pleasure engrossed us for some time I shall go on with my account of places roads c  From MONMOUTHwhich commands a beautiful view of both the Wye and the Munowwe passed to HEREFORD the whole time beguiled by extensive rich and variegated prospects Brown CERES every where had spread her golden store and plump POMONA half sunk under the weight of her abundant horn My friend whotill he took this journey with mehad never been forty miles out of LONDON felt as if he had been transported to Elysium and as our journey from MONMOUTH was on a Sunday we took occasion to remark on the decent cleanliness of the villagers and the sober thankful appearance which nature that morning wore We did not go to church but I think we had as much the glow of religion in our hearts as those who did You know among my amusements I practise painting and I declare most sacredly that in delineating the form of a treesweeping with my pencil over hills and valliesreflecting the various tints of fleecy clouds on the smooth bosom of an extensive riverbut more than all thisrolling in the aetherial expanse and commanding the winds to shape a collected vapour into a graceful formHERVEY never had more delicious contemplations in his flowergarden than I in those moments An adoration of the author of nature thrills through my spontaneous fancy and the expansion of my mind lifts me above the dazzling splendour of emperors All this I felt on our journeyand for four hours could talk of nothing else I lamented the evils that persecutions dogmas and schisms have introduced into the world and how often the mildest and most charitable name that ever dignified human nature has been wickedly usedby abominable prieststo enforce slaughter  exaggerated by cruelty How much more consonant to the  essence  would be the  worship  of a SUPREME BEING ifwithout a single reflection on what others doit were comprized in an obedient thankfulness of heart and a sincere and grateful acknowledgment of the imminent favours and distinctions we so bountifully receive from his gracious hand  HEREFORD seems to be as insensible of these blessings as a gorged alderman of true flavour The views continued with very little variation in point of beauty through our whole route till we got to WOLVERHAMPTON when the country became  flat  and the soil  sandy  About five miles before you reach LEOMINSTERwhich circumstance I mention as a remarkable instance of erudition in the commissioners of the highway in that part of the world of which body I hope 'Squire KIRKMAN is not a memberthere is a board placed up with the following words  "Whoever drives of this road shall be informed upon"  For my part I would not make any impertinent remarks on any thing I meet but perhaps they hold some charter in this part of the world by using this sort of orthography It is full as sensibleand much more innocentthan baiting the bull at STAMFORD as howeverthough it was incomprehensibleit must imply some caution my friend made a very admissible alteration and it read thus  "Whoever drives  on  this road shall be  imposed  upon"  Which it must be confessed after the four horses from CHEPSTOW and an extravagant bill at the  Beaufort Arms  at MONMOUTH we considered as no unwholesome hint and it was pretty well confirmed when we set out from LUDLOW going from which place to BRIDGENORTHif the traveller do not take great carehe will be sent twentyfive miles instead of eighteen You are asked if you chuse to make it one stage or two and told that the road is very hilly It is more likely therefore you will preferas we didthe two stages that the horses may be fresh and draw you with more spirit eighteen miles being really a long stage in that country Thus without saying a word more they take you to CLEBURYfor in the direct road over THE MOOR and through ASTON and DOWN there is no  place to  change horses  CLEBURY is  twelve  miles from LUDLOW and BRIDGENORTH  thirteen  more from CLEBURY Thus according to my friend it is plain those who drive on that roadif they are not warywill be  imposed  upon  Passing over the clay hills in Shropshire is perhaps one of the most stupendous and wonderful instances of extent and fertility that nature has in all her domain The objects are so innumerabletheir forms so variedand their colours so beautiful that the eye isif I may be allowed the expressionagonized with enjoyment Every hundred yards presents a new scene and every scene more charming than that which went before it till the rapt fancy rises to sublimity and exquisite pleasure is lost in mute wonder Nor are these expressions too strong for the subject The hills were  "cloud capt"  and no air balloon could be better situated for a good prospect than was our chaise  In the whole of this journey I was lost in pleasing astonishment and could not help exclaiming in the text of this letterwhich you may call a sermon if you please for even in this age I am not ashamed of moralizing  "When I consider the heavens and the work of thy fingers"  Adieu Confess with me there is not an enjoyment equal to that which pleases on reflection One of which is that I take when I tell you that  I am With truth Your obliged friend C DIBDIN  Sheffield    Jan    LETTER XXVIII  MORE WONDERS  "  What a piece of work is man  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  HAVING woundlike the worm of a corkscrewround that natural fortification that renders BRIDGENORTH a little GIBRALTERwe arrived there and supped on the wonders we had seenfor as to the musty chickens and highflavoured ham there was no eating them The next morning we explored all the beauties of that uncommonly picturesque country and after dinner while curiosity was on tiptoe went on to COALBROOK DALE where we intended to stay the night and see every thing worthy of observation This however was not in our powerfor the stench of the sulphur was so potent that we were taken ill and I protestthough I have as few squeamish sensations as most peopleI never felt myself so overcome in my life Indeed the day was insufferably hot which added to the monstrous piles of coal burning to cokethe furnacesforgesand other tremendous objects of fire and smoke which spread round us to an immense distancemight probably cause that suffocating sensation of which I can give no adequate description but by saying thatas far as conception can pictureit must have a faint resemblance of being placed in an air pumpAnd yet though we laboured under this difficulty of respiration the inhabitants  and the workmen especiallyfeel no inconvenience but on the contrary as we were told are remarkably healthy and live to a great age  Some particulars relative to the place we were determined however to ascertain The tarspring for example was too curious an object to be passed by unnoticed We went into the mouth of a bricked archway which reaches three hundred yards and when we had got about thirty yards we began to see the tar ooze from between the crannies in the rock It must be understood that from the top of the rock a pit had been sunk which went to such an immense depth that it would have been very expensive and indeed almost impracticable to work it But finding the coals of an admirable quality it was thought worth while to form the archway above described at the foot of the mountain and very near the Severn that the coal might be drawn out in carriages which mode of getting at theminstead of the usual wayit was thought would be so much more expeditious and convenient as to make a savingin a short timeequal to the expence of having formed the archway In the prosecution of this scheme the tar made its appearanceat first oozing as we had seen it and afterwards pouring like an inundation fairly flowing into the Severn The discovery was made known and the course of the tar diverted by means of iron pipes which I assure the reader are nearly as large as those which convey the water from the new river in LONDON Large pits were immediately dug and caldrons of a prodigious magnitude sunk and by boiling in those it hardened into pitch There are three springs one of which emits an astonishing quantity The first when we were there was nearly dried up which induces the workmen to believe that in time the whole will cease But who can say in  what  time The same rock may be traced seven milesand every body knows at that distance they are now extracting tar from coal which very probably is a drossy part of the very tar thatabout half a mile from the iron bridgeruns thicker than treacle but as pellucid as Burgundy  I have since conversed with a chymical gentleman who has bought a great deal of it and he assures me it has the strongest similitude of any thing he ever saw or read of to the famous black pitch used by the Egyptians for embalming This tar is remarkably free from impurity is as bituminous as asphaltum and has an agreeable odour not unlike benjamin  I must not leave COALBROOK DALE without saying something of the famous iron bridge That stupendous  pattern card  for it may well be called sois in every respect one of the most  artful  and ingenious contrivances that ever was conceived or executed by man  It consists of one archand the river is in that place an hundred yards over  for at the same time that it proves the dusky inhabitants of that gloomy region are equal to any thing in the way of iron workthough ever so ponderous and immenseit is a source of continual profita constant toll being kept up which cannot be for the repair of the bridgefor though it looks like network wrought in wire it will apparently last uninjured for ages  I offered Mr HARRISas will hereafter be seena number of ideas wrought into complete scenes which might in future supply matter for different Pantomimes This would have been one of them He rejected the offer however as uselessI am nevertheless well assured that I could have furnished him with admirable matter in that wayto accomplish which I had nothing to do but look around and express those feelings musically and poetically with which the object at that moment impressed meIf in future any of the scenes I describe in this work should be introduced into a pantomime I hope the credit of the  original idea  will be given to menot for the  value  of the thingonly that the saddle may be placed upon the  right horse  This place wants nothing but CERBERUS to give you an idea of the heathen HELL The Severn may pass for the Styxwith this differencethat old CHARON become a turnpikeman ushers you over the iron bridge instead of rowing you in his crazy bark The men and women might easily be mistaken for devils and furiesand the entrance of any one of those blazing caverns for the approach of TARTARUS Jesting apart If an atheist who  never heard of COALBROOK DALE could be transported there in a dream and left to wake at the mouth of one of those furnaces surrounded on all sides with such numbers of infernal objectsthough he had been all his life the most profligate unbeliever that ever added blasphemy to incredulityhe would infallibly tremble at the just punishment he was in imagination going to receive  My friend's first remark when he saw these dingy gentlemen wasthat he should be sorry to meet any of them in a bye lane Having made the very same observation to my friend BOYTON upon the colliers at KINGSWOODand being by him satisfied as to the fallacy of itI was able to refute his apprehensions by saying that I made no doubt but some reformer had done the state so much service as to have reconciled these people to their situationby an assurance that if they would be honest they should only have a hell in  this world  This turned out to be the case One half of them are quakers and the other methodists Thus was gloom familiar to themNor do I mean to be sarcasticfor I declare I think that the civilizing the  colliers  of KINGSWOOD does more honour to Mr WESLEY is a better fight and crowns him with more laurels than ever were reaped by all the heroes of the  holy war  the upright perpetrators of the massacre of St Bartholomewor the pious tortures of all the unfortunate victims that ever were brought to an inquisitorial stake  "What a piece of work is man"  and yet while there are such characters as the above  "man delights not me"  except indeed a few select friends to whom I devote myself and among whom no one more than yourself has the good wishes of  I hope I may sayThe ample hearted C DIBDIN  Sheffield    Jan    LETTER XXIX  RESUSCITATIONWITHOUT THE HELP OF THE HUMANE SOCIETY  "  I wonder men are not afraid to look into a newspaper lest they should meet with something to make them unhappy for the rest of their lives  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  HAVING washed the sulphur out of out throats by a dish of tea we set out for SHEFFNAL and afterwards for WOLVERHAMPTON where it was said we should find the best inn in the kingdomnamely the  George  Arriving there however at eleven o'clock and finding every body in bed did not give us an idea of the most watchful inn in the kingdomand getting no supper till one o'clock and then a very bad one did not prove it was the best provided larder in the kingdom  The next day we moved to the  Red Lion  where we were really well treatedand the assembly room being in the house I advertised my entertainment for one night which was a very indifferent one indeed as however it was an unfavourable time and the notice was short I sincerely believe I should have mended my success if I had stayed longer I have in the little time which I was there to thank Mr LANE a merchant and Mr SMART the bookseller for several civilitiesand I believe this is all I have to say of WOLVERHAMPTON except that we saw the process of working up that very iron which at COALBROOK DALE was in so crude a state into every possible kind of formwith the addition of all that belongs to the art of japanning  I must not forget to remark that the wonderful discovery of the tar spring was at WOLVERHAMPTONthough at so small a distanceconsidered as a mere fable  Leaving WOLVERHAMPTON we went to BIRMINGHAM and from thence to LICHFIELD Here I resolved to give my entertainment and procured for that purpose the vicar's hall which requiring the consent of a certain number of gentlemen it came out among my enquiries that Mr PETER GARRICK was living and in good health As the newspapers long agoindeed just after the death of his two brothershad been inhuman enough to kill him I never was more surprized at any thing in my life for never having seen the account of his death contradicted I own I firmly believed him at rest with his ancestors  The moment I found where Mr GARRICK lived I hastened to pay him my respects He was very glad to see me and we chatted together I believe an hour The old times of the  Jubilee  and the levees of HAMPTON made great part of our conversation and we felt mutual pleasure and pain at the recollection There were so many points of superior abilities about GARRICK that though historical justice obliging one to be  faithful  impels a retrospect of  little  One of the most striking of these is I believe the following GARRICK one dayjust before the  Christmas Tale  made its appearancewent into the painting room and seeing as he imagined a prodigious quantity of gold strewed about the floor began to abuse first the man who was grinding the colours and afterwards to bawl out lustily for FRENCH the painter FRENCH made his appearance and was thus accosted  'Whawhyheydammewhy you Mr FRENCHis not iteythe cursedest thingthat you will in this harum skarum mannerheadammeruin me'  "God bless my soul"  cried FRENCH  "what is the matter Sir"  'The matter Sirwhy where are youwith your damned lacklustre eyesdon't you see the ground all strewed with gold I believe you think I roll in money'  "Gold Siroh what the Dutch metal that we have rubbed off in gilding the new sceneit is not worth twopence"  'Welltwopenceand pray why the devil should I lose twopencedo you consider what twopence a day comes to in a year'  "Well Sir it is nothing out of your pocket"  'Yes Sir butayawyouare a damned curious sort of aheyhow is it nothing out of my pocket'  "Why you know Sir I have a salary for finding all these things"  'Ohaheya salarywhy then damme if I care twopence about it'  as well as  great  actions yet in recollecting the pleasureable moments passed in his company one naturally rejoices that in the duty  of a  recorder  we can mingle a little the task of a  panegyrist  I certainly had many differences with GARRICK and they arose from nothing but thisI would never flatter him Indeed had I been capable of that creeping adulation without which no man can arrive to a responsible situation in the theatrical cabinet or at least keep itunless perhaps he be independantI might certainly now have been in possession of a decent appointmentroundly assessed by the byetogether with the superlative happiness of being puffed in all the newspapers  GARRICK notwithstanding I sincerely believe had as good an opinion of me as of any man he ever was connected with and on my part I declare that nothing ever gave me more pleasure than my reconciliation with him before he died which happenedand it is a remarkable circumstanceat the last rehearsal of my pantomime of  The Touchstone  on the night before he went to LORD SPENCER's from whence all the world knows he returned to the ALDELPHI to breathe his last  Mr PETER GARRICK attended my performanceand for one testified much satisfaction The company however in general were extremely grave which I could not possibly account for especially as Mr SAVILLEwho made me many professions of kindness and servicetook minutes of the most striking serious songs with a view of singing them himself The truth however at last came out It seems Miss SEWARD was therewithout whose permission nobody at LICHFIELD dares to judge of any thing literary My entertainment therefore coming in some degree under this description and that ladyangry I suppose that I should burlesque the  Siege of Troy  or conjure up the spirit of an  old maid  or for some other notable reason no doubtdid not chuse to wear a smile the whole evening What was the issue  The DEAN looked graveMr SAVILLE looked graveevery body but Mr PETER GARRICK looked grave I announced the second eveningevery body looked grave I attended the second eveningNOBODY CAME  It has been confidently said to me that a musical man at LICHFIELD was very industrious first to prevent and afterwardsfinding that impossibleto decry my entertainment If this be not a fact the man I allude tounconscious of illwill suffer nothing If it be let him reflectfor I will not give myself the pain of saying morethat illiberality was never yet the companion of real genius  Before I quit LICHFIELD I must not forget to mention Mr GREEN's museumwhich certainly for its size is one of the completest in the kingdom The ores of various sorts are remarkably curious The coins medals and impressions largein point of numberand valuablein point of neatness correctness and preservation The display of the force of magnetism is singularly worth attention but indeed to enumerate every particular of this cabinet of curiositieswhich is wonderfully well filledwould go far beyond my limits and yet fall infinitely short of what the subject deserves  Adieu LICHFIELDand adieu Mr GARRICKmay he long enjoy that solicitous attention he so amply receives from his friends nor may the dart of death or any other human ill for years have more power to hurt him than the ineffectual calumny of a  newspaper  Yours Most sincerely C DIBDIN  Sheffield    Jan    LETTER XXX  A NASTY SUBJECTTREATED AS DELICATELY AS POSSIBLE  "  What's bred in the bone  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  WE came to DERBY a day after the races which might be said to befor mea day after the fairfor though during two nights that I performed there I was not so thinly attended as at WOLVERHAMPTON yet it turned out nothing of consequence Here we saw that wonderful effect of human ingenuity the  silk mill  We purchased some of the productions of the  Peak  and we were witness to the whole process of forming drying painting and burning porcelain  It has happened among the uncommon circumstances which have attended this TOUR thatlike Sir ROGER DE COVERLY with his watermen and hackneycoach menI have employed by way of billcarriers scarcely one who has not had some natural infirmity At OXFORD I had two men who had not an arm and a half between them at another place I had a sailor with a wooden leg I have had men with one eye out of number but here at DERBY my  factotum  had been twice screwed up in his coffin He gave the account of it himselfand described that having lain so long in the cold had given him ever since such a pain in his bones thatas HAMLET says  "mine ached to think on't"  He had had from his cradle a lethargic  habit and the first time he was supposed to be dead he laid in a profound sleep for several days the second time longer butbeing aware of the probable consequence of nailing him up too soonthey kept him till they were convinced he was actually dead and having screwed him upbeing nearly suffocatedhe knocked as before and was let out His senses were considerably impaired after thisyet as far as they went they were so acute and collected that he never made a single blunder in all the messages I gave him  Though human calamities are the last subject on which I should chuse to be facetious yet I cannot here refrain from recording an anecdotebut little knownof THE CIBBER This strange eccentric wag in company with three other  Bon Vivants  made an excursion to FRANCE THE had a false set of teetha second a  glasseye  a third a  cork leg  but the fourth had nothing particular except a remarkable way of shaking his head They travelled in a post coachand while they were going the first stageafter each had made merry with his neighbour's infirmitythey agreed that at every baiting place they would all affect the same singularity When they came to breakfast they were all to squintand as the countrymen stood gaping round when they first alighted  'od rot it'  cried one  'how that man squints'  'Why dom thee'  says a second  'here be another squinting fellow'  The third was thought to be a better squinter than the other two and the fourth better than all the rest In short language cannot express how admirably they squintedfor they went one degree beyond the superlative At dinner they all appeared to have cork legs and their stumping about made more diversion than they had done at breakfast At tea they were all deaf but at supperwhich was at the Ship at DOVEReach man reassumed his character the better to play his part in a farce they had concerted among them When they were ready to go to bed CIBBER called out to the waiter  'Here you fellowtake out my teeth'  "Teeth Sir"  said the man  'Ay teeth Sir Unscrew that wire and you will find they'll all come out together'  After some hesitation the man did as he was ordered This was no sooner performed than a second called out  'here youtake out my eye'  "Lord Sir"  said the waiter  "your eye"  'Yes my eye Come here you stupid dogpull up that eyelid and it will come out as easy as possible'  This done a third cried out  'here you rascaltake off my leg'  This he did with less reluctance being before apprized that it was cork and also conceived that it would be his last job He was however mistaken The fourth watched his opportunity and while the poor frightened waiter was surveying with a rueful countetenance the  eye teeth  and  leg  laying upon the tablecryed out in a frightful hollow voice  'come here Sirtake off my head'  Turning round and seeing the man's head shaking like that of a mandarine upon a chimney piece he darted out of the roomand after tumbling headlong down stairs he ran about the house swearing that the  gentlemen  up stairs were certainly all  devils  This is a proper place to notice that at WORCESTER a  madman  took a great liking to me He is perfectly harmless and suffered to go to all their public entertainments He promised to subscribe five thousand pounds towards building me a room and said Mr PITT would repay him out of the overplus after saving the million a year I should not have mentioned this man but for one circumstance He calls himself Sir EDWARD MASON Knight of the pokercarrying a large one constantly in his button holeand has badges of distinction sewed all over his clothes Asking him how he came by a fine star upon his sleeve  'Sir'  said he the KING OF PRUSSIAthe KING OF PRUSSIAlast battlemark of  'honourhe and Ifought the whole armykilled conquered and plunderedtied the commander to a treerobbed him of  forty thousand pounds  and his WATCH'  Thus how naturally he consolidated the characters of  warrior  and  thief  Having been on a flat sandy soil ever since we left Shropshire we began to look about us in our way to NOTTINGHAMwhere there are certainly many picturesque viewsand for people not just comeas we werefrom the borders of WALESfor I affronted a Welch waiter in Monmouthshire by asking him if we might not call ourselves in WALESto which he  answered  'Cot pless hur and luff hur to be sure it is  Waales  but it is not  Welch Waales  look you'  NOTTINGHAM castle is a very handsome object and the uniformity of the piazza in the marketplace gave me an idea of its being a very likely town for my purposebut I was born to bear and laugh at disappointmentsas you shall hear  We are told that NOTTINGHAM was by the  Saxons  called SNOTTINGHAM upon which word one might so pun as to make it truly describe the inhabitants for they are a kind of  mucus  which though useful in the general work of commercial circulation cannot avoid being in itself  nasty  After having consulted with Master BURBAGE the printer I thought it necessary to see Mr MAYOR who passed by the shop door as we were talking and at BURBAGE's desire walked in I do not recollect the gentleman's namebut having told him my business he exclaimed  "niow you actor man what would you  hay  I hope you don't coom with ony  drooms  and  troompets  "  'What Sir'  said little BURBAGE  'drums and trumpets Mr DIBDIN with drums and trumpets Good God Mr MAYOR Sirwhy Sirdrums and trumpetsdo you know the price is halfacrownyou don't know Mr DIBDINhow could youLord have mercy Mr MAYORdrums and trumpets'  "Well well well well"  cried the MAYOR  "I do not know about these things but I don't want a hooboob in the tiown Will you onswer that it wawnt corrupt the morals of the prentices and the work folk"  BURBAGE undertook for mebut not till he had completely gone over the business of the drums and trumpets once more  After Mr MAYOR had retiredquite satisfied no doubt with having shewn his consequence and great regard to the morals of the SNOTTINGHAMITESI enquired of my friend little BURBAGE how the taste of the town stood in relation to entertainments and he very honestly told me that if I would advertise to swallow pins or eat burning tow I should stand a better chance than by furnishing any thing that appealed to the understandings and liberal feelings of mankind  'Or suppose'  said he  'you was to let them come in gratis at a shilling apiece'  I could not possibly conceive what he would be at Upon asking him to explain  'Oh'  said he  'the CHEVALIER TAYLOR practised such a  manoeuvre  with wonderful successHe wrote a letter indiscriminately to every inhabitant of NOTTINGHAMsayingthat he would give a lecture on the eye  gratis  His room was not only thronged but every lady made a point of dressing herself in her best in return to the CHEVALIER's politeness They were first admitted into an outer room and attended by a kind of master of ceremonies who informed them with great good breeding and deference that as the lecture the CHEVALIER meant to give was very abstruse and could not possibly be rendered familiar to the comprehension of such as did not anatomically understand opticshis employer the CHEVALIER had with great condescension and good nature caused a book to be printed which would clearly  explain the most difficult passages of the lecture even to the meanest understanding that indeed this book was worth  half a crown  but the CHEVALIER determined in all things to shew his candour and disinterestednesswould have the very great kindness to sell it at no more than  one shilling  Some few murmured but the major part bought the book and thus the crafty CHEVALIER put in his pocket about five hundred shillings through an impudent stratagem when by the common mode of advertising two shillings admittance he would have been a fortnight receiving five pounds God'  said little BURBAGEfor he is a talkative goodnatured fellow  'I'll tell you another story of the CHEVALIER He bespoke a wig Sira tie wigof a poor harmless fellowa barber here in our good town of NOTTINGHAMand went away to LOUGHBOROUGH without it It happened to be marketdayI had some business at LOUGHBOROUGH and I  sees  a fellow stalking along with a devilish great bandbox under his arm I thought I knew himand who should it be but our barbershaves memakes my wigs All he is angry at isthat I wear my red cap so long in a morning that I make  one  wig serve the time of THREE Well Sir Who the devil are you looking for says I Why says he the CHEVALIER TAYLORthe poor dear gentleman forgot his wig Good lack And you have been so civil to tramp with it sixteen miles after him Very kind indeed Well but Master BURBAGE 'twas worth whilea deal of money To make short of the story to you Sir The  barber  carries the wig to the  Chevalier  What do you call this says the  occulist  A wig Sir says the barber A wig Why 'tis no more like a wig than a cabbage The hair is frizzled and crampt and hedgehogg'd and porcupin'dOh take it away In short after having so abused it that he almost persuaded the barber to be out of conceit with it himselfhe offered about a fourth for it of what they originally agreed for and at length the poor shaverrather than carry back a wig that would suit nobody elsereceived the money and they parted'  Thus was the CHEVALIER collectively and individually too cunning for the fraternity of stocking weavers I could not however buckle to any thing that carried  with it the face of an imposition and therefore thought but little of my chance As however I had incurred some expence I resolved to performbut so determined were theythis timenot to be tricked that if I had not actually held out a  manoeuvre  though a very honest oneI should have made nothing of NOTTINGHAM So much had they the old proverb with them  Adieu  Yours very faithfully C DIBDIN  Leeds    February    LETTER XXXI  ON INCREDULITY  "  I pray you think you reason with a Jew  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  THE old contemptible business of supposing me an impostor was brought up at NOTTINGHAM The report had gone out and one WISE gentleman assured me that he had seen Mr DIBDIN in  a black wig  three years before at the  Circus  Finding matters were taking an unpleasant turn I advertised thatas I understood such a rumour had prevailed and as it was a very serious thing for me that it should be cleared upif any at the end of the entertainment should feel the smallest difficulty to believe that I was in no respect an impostor their money should be returned This brought me a good room and ten minutes had not passed before I plainly saw all their doubts were vanished At the place I generally pause many apologies were made me to which some spirited officers present answered that  'the best thing they could possibly do was to be totally silent for the utmost in their power to say would rather aggravate than lessen the absurdity of their conduct  I introduced upon this occasion in the  Readings  what follows The poet related a whimsical distress he had once laboured under Said he  'I once took it in my head to deliver a little entertainment at different places which I called  Readings  and being possessed of good professional reputation it was sometimes suspected that a man of my standing would not think such an experiment worth his whileand in consequence I was now and then treated as an impostor foras one may saypersonating myself This induced me to relate to my next audience the following poetic tale'  IN ROME where arts spring up 'tis said  As spawn shoots in a mushroom bed  Two theatres of some renown  Aspir'd alike to please the town  Bothon the plan of ours in LONDON  Were sometimes rich and sometimes undone  Were sometimes emptysometimes cramm'd  And prais'd and

common sense and reason  All arguments were out of season  And while the frenzy rages high  Fair truth itself shall seem a lie  From selfconviction then be wise  The task's not hardbelieve your eyes  I thought my business was now to make an honourable retreat which I did having previously agreedwith the only gentleman who paid me any thing like attentionto return in the month of November when it was imagined they would think I did them a favour and consequently make up for their former neglect Whether this was a reasonable conjecture or not will appear in due time  On the following Thursday we arrived at that pretty clean town NEWARK I made some enquiries concerning the place and found little prospect of performing to advantage therefore after dining at the  Kingston's Arms  the history of which house I shall give in its placeon the best cutlets that ever were eaten we extended our journey to LINCOLN where we put up at the  Rein Deer  I could make nothing at all of this place Every thing seemed so grave and inanimate that I conceived it would be a great folly to stay This resolution was accelerated by finding that the corporation was in a sort of demur about the propriety of my performance I might however have been assured that every thing was perfectly safe when they sent a message by the waiter to invite me to supper I nevertheless excused myself and though the MAYOR told me I might  act  whenever I pleased we left LINCOLN passed through SPITAL BRIGG and BARTON and arrived in the afternoonafter a very good passage across the HUMBERat HULL  Here I was to be introduced to a gentleman who could give me every possible accommodation for my entertainment and on my friend's account was to do this gratis According to custom however I was to be disappointed This gentleman was then in LONDON nor did he arrive in time to do me any material service so that this part of the worldwhich I expected would do such great thingsfailed nor could I in four nights at HULL and three at BEVERLY muster more than my expences  In my next letter I shall carry you a longer circuit to as little purpose all which loose matter I shall bring to an end as soon as possible that I may not tire either you or my readers in general with repeated ill successupon which indeed I should be silent if I did not conceive it my duty to set down every thing As to the men of NOTTINGHAM I made up my mind to their incredulity as firmly as  Antonio  did to the arguments of  Shylock  which had not more of cruelty than the declaration I now make youhas of kindnessthat I am  Most heartily Yours C DIBDIN  Newcastle    Feb    LETTER XXXII  A LONG DANCE WITHOUT A FIDDLE  "  For this among the rest I was ordain'd  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  AT HULL my friend left me with a viewas his affairs in town pressed his returnto prosecute the remainder of his journey with more expedition than my scheme would permit From HULL I went to YORK where I performed by way of essay without mentioning any specific time I was tolerably attended and a gentlemanin the name of the restadvised me as the oratorios at DONCASTER were to be in the following week not to do any thing more at YORK till they should be over I took his advice and went to MALTON and SCARBOROUGH At the first place I received many promises which as they were made by the parson and the attorney it is not wonderful that they came to nothing At SCARBOROUGH nobody would stir without the DUCHESS OF RUTLAND and as I had neither time nor interest to conciliate her patronage I returned with my jaunt for my pains At my next essay at YORK the company were to be sure returned from DONCASTERbut they were not recovered from their fatigue I thereforeto give them a little more breathing timewas coaxed into another excursion and promised great things on my return  My intention was to have a few nights alternately at LEEDS and WAKEFIELD Having however a very thin audience indeed at the first place and being out of temper with YORK I went by the advice of a clergyman at WAKEFIELDin whose company I had the pleasure of passing some happy hoursto SHEFFIELD Having however very little time to sparethis being the fifteenth of October and my advertisements standing for the eighteenth at YORK I performed two nightsone of which was a very decent oneand received so much private and public civility that I promised when the players should be gonewhich was not expected to be till after Christmasto return Coming back to WAKEFIELD I had a third night which was a very good one At SHEFFIELD I met with Dr MILLER of DONCASTER and Mr F SHARP of GRANTHAM both of whom gave me warm invitations to their respective towns which you will find in the sequel I accepted  I shall not say a word at present of these different placeshaving to touch at them againnot even of YORK to which I returned to worse purpose than ever and left it in disgust From thence I went to BEVERLY to call a council of war with my friend SOUTHERN to whom I shall introduce the reader This gentleman has the whole business of HULL and BEVERLY as a dancing mastera character not always worthy a conspicuous situationbut here and in the instance of Mr SOUTHERN's son at WAKEFIELDwho I could not place before his fatherremarkably so  Mr SOUTHERN is no foreign impostor of which descriptionto the disgrace of our schools the injury of the scholars' morals and too often the destruction of family peacethis kingdom swarms  I must confess I never feel any thing like satisfaction at the distress of others except when these frontless gentlemen meet with men as crafty as themselves There are instances however when foreigners are as much imposed on in ENGLAND as ENGLISHMEN are in FRANCEand the following is one of them FIERVILLE who wallowing in English riches did notlike his countrymen in generalretire and laugh at his patrons but gave into every extravagant folly he could devise had among the rest a MENAGERIE and would give any sum for extraordinary objects to fill it This a certain dealer in wild beasts and foreign birdsnot far from the top of the  Haymarket  hearing he demined to make something out of FIERVILLE For this purpose he called one day at his country houseaccompanied by a man with a large basketand desired to speak with him Being shewn in he accosted FIERVILLE  'Servant Sir hearing as how you was a gemmen worry fond of curiosities I have brought you two of the most beautifulest birds in the whole world'  "I am very glad to see you Sare"  said FIERVILLE  "Vill you please to tell me vat it is"  'Why you must know Sir I have had a lord or two after them and several fine ladies and I believe one duchessbut I loves the foreign gentlemen d'ye see by reason all my goods come from abroadand so Sir I had rather you should have these PINK GEESE of mine than another'  "PIG GEESE God bleash me I was never hear of Pig Geese"  'Why no please your honour Sirthey be'nt a common thing No no 'tis well known I deals in nothing but kurus affairs so you fee if you likes it they be yours for twenty guineas'  "Vell dat is not great deal of monies indeet When will you please Sare to let me see dem"  'Why lord love you they be without here BOB bring in the basket There Siryou never sawed a statelier finer bird in the whole course of your life'  "Pon my vord hiss very hansey indeet Cot bleash my soul it is all over sine ret How much you say  twenty guineas  Vat I shall do I must have the geesebut I got no monies"  O Lord never mind that I don't want 'money There is two sine cows and a calf under the window I'll take they for the  geese  '  FIERVILLE who was in deep contemplation on the beauties of his new acquisition exclaimed  "pless my soul well toughtyou shall have dem Here Chon Go kif that gentleman dat koes and de kofe"  In short the man drove away the cows and the calf and left the  pink geese  behind which were deposited in an outhouse till a proper place could be prepared for them The next morning a friend of FIERVILLEa blunt honest fellowcame to visit him on whom he opened immediately  "Ah my teer friend I haf de most crate curiosity ever was see Do you know I have cot two very fine  pig geese  "  '  Big geese  '  cried the other  'so have I twenty what the devil curiosity is there in that'  "No no you don't understandfine colour ret peautiful Come along vid me"  He then took his friend to the outhouse which having carelessly been lest open the geese had made their escape After a close search for some time they found them feeding in an adjoining paddock but it having rained in the night the  pink geese  were become as  grey as a badger  and nothing could have discovered they were the same but now and then a little red spot under the wings  'Why damme'  cried the friend  'you have been imposed uponthese are nothing but a couple of common grey Lincolnshire fen geese'  "By cot"  said FIERVILLE  "he vas ferry fine ret indeet last night Hole your tongue perhaps by um by he come ret again"  'Red again'  said the friend  'why you are a damned foolthe fellow has imposed upon you I tell you What did you give pray for this pretty bargain'  "Two koes and a kofe"  After reprobating FIERVILLE's credulity in pretty strong terms his anger all turned on the bird merchant who he swore should smart for this impudent fraud To put his design in execution he went immediately to him and having threatened to take him before Sir SAMPSON WRIGHT procured a restitution of fourteen poundsthe sum for which it was pretended the cows and calf were sold  There is another anecdote of this same monstermongerHe sold to a lady of distinction a number of what he called JAVA SPARROWS which were of course no more than common ENGLISH SPARROWS stained a fine blue At the time of their moulting they became exactly like other SPARROWS when being sent for and taxed with the imposition he had the address to make it believed that it was the climate and the common food of birds in this country that made them degenerate and that if they were carried back to JAVA they would infallibly recover their former beauty  He is an honest plain  unaffected wellmeaning manis a father himselfhas brought up a large family creditably and industriously and therefore proper to have the care of youth entrusted to him He is universally beloved and his companyfor he is remarkably cheerful and heartyevery where courted His advice and his influence has been of great use to me for there is scarcely a place in Yorkshire since I first left BEVERLY where his name has not done me service  My journey to BEVERLYas I before remarkedwas more for a consultati on than from any prospect of success Mr SOUTHERN however hadprevious to my arrivalconsulted with all the principal people and I was to be invited as soon as I came to a supper in order to form the best possible plan for making me two good nights Out of  nineteen  however who attended the  supper  but  four  came to the  performance  I must not neglect to say that Mr ACKLUM Mr HARDEN then the  Mayor  and some few others merit my acknowledgments for their attention but as to the rest they had skimmed the cream of the entertainment for nothing and how could I be such an ideot as to suppose they would afterwards be contented to pay for the skimmilk But  "for this among the rest I was ordained"  and so I was to tell you very frequently but always truly that I am  Yours most fervently C DIBDIN  Newcastle    February    LETTER XXXIII  THE SOLICITUDE OF A FRIEND  "  I should not call you scoundrel if I did not love you  "  To Mr DIBDIN  DEAR SIR  GO to INDIAdig in minestempt any dangerdo any thing to better your fortuneto place yourself beyond the power of such humiliation I declare to heaven I could not  sustain  the mortifications that you have  smiled  at let what might be the consideration The nasty  Snottinghamites  alone would have sickened me to such a degree that when I appeared before them it would have given me all the qualmishness and have produced all the effect of an emetic And yet you promised to return It will disappoint me andthough I warmly wish you welldisplease me if it produce any advantage to you  What shall I call you That you are susceptiblequickly vividly soI am convinced and yet where sensibility might laudably honestly take fire you exhibit a stoicism beyond all example I cannot comprehend you I have traced you now since you first corresponded with me nearly fourteen hundred miles What to do It is impossible it can have been worth your while Can the conversation and attention of a few individuals of taste and discernment approach any thing near to an amends for all the contumely heaped on you by the suspicions of a set of people who have placed you in  every unpleasant point of view and who believe nothing but that you levy contributions among them Have I not myself seen doubts and difficulties started in every corner of the room nods winks and shrugs have gone round and when at last in spite of their teeth they have been obliged to confess their suspicions were invidious and unhandsome their selfconviction has put them so out of humour with themselves and the tardy lagging justice came out in so reluctant a concession that they seemed to wish you had been proved an impostor rather than that their own ignorant and illiberal suspipicions should be falsified  If you restrain your real feelings to teach you patience give you fortitude and brace your mind to an endurance and make it up to all the consequences of your intended voyage you must have a philosophic heroism but little known and less practised In which caseand indeed in any caseI now give you leave to go to INDIA where a small part of this perseveranceI should thinkmust enable you to return in comfort and enjoy years of  happiness  sweetened with INDEPENDENCE which desirable situation no man more truly wishes to see you in than  My dear Sir  Your faithful and obliged friend *****  Feb    LETTER XXXIV  THE DUTY OF A PUBLIC MAN  "  Fame's an echo  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  YOUR last letter is so pointed that I shall stop short my narrative to answer it and that the world may be in better possession of the subject I have a printed proof of it before me  You have taken more pains to abuse me than I have to deserve it and I could silence all that warmth and vivacity in which you calumniate me under the title of a susceptible stoic by singly asserting that I am a PUBLIC CHARACTER  'Good God'  say you  '  so am I  '  Have patience  You  can dictate to your audience you can win them by honest and fair persuasion to a discharge of that duly without the exercise of which they can neither be good men nor valuable citizens Butadmirable as your doctrines aredo you think no pulpit oration of yours has been criticised Did you never see a guttling alderman asleepwhile some fortune hunter was making love to his daughterin one of your very best sermons When you have strove with benevolent mildness to inculcate the principles of reasonable religion and blend public worship with private morality were you upon your honour never blamed for tameness and insipidity and censured for not frightening your hearers into a sense of their miserable sinful condition by lowering out damnation with uplifted hands  A field preacher is not fairly inducted into his calling till he has been forty times stunned with brick bats and blind puppies But this is nothing to what is every day sustained by men in much more conspicuous situations than you or I Is Mr Fox's poisoned bag forgot the difficulty with which Mr PITT made his escape from the grocers' company or the dingy appearance of Lord JOHN CAVENDISH after he had been rolled in the kennel at YORK Beside these matters fluctuate What is a mark of disgrace at one time shall at another be a badge of honour and it has been often seen that a man who has been pelted with dead cats todayby the hands of the MOBhas tomorrow received a ribbon at the hands of his SOVEREIGN  A French authorby way of commenting on general mannerscarries several different characters to a variety of parts and among the rest places them among a horde of savages Doubtful what may be their reception they consult together what to dolest by some mistake in their mode of addressing the natives they my get murdered At lungth a CARTHUSIAN MONKwho has observed that in their ceremonies they use among one another are mixed many extravagant actions and gesticulationsgoes up to their chief and having sworn at him in a good round hand brandished a cudgel over his head kicked him in the guts and spit in this face the whole troop pay homage to the strangers and they are treated with every possible civility while they remain among them  Shew me the most fulsome puff you ever saw to prop a sinking play or recommend a faded actress and I will shew you an advertisement from a parliamentary candidate to match it How completely has CHURCHILL written a lampoon on himself in the  Conference  I think it is the paragraph which begins with that nonsensical distich  "May Ican greater ill mankind befal  "Be born a WHITEHEAD and baptiz'd a PAUL"  He goes on enumerating what in his idea contains the sum total of  opprobrium  and  obloquy  and finishes with sayingthat the friendship of one WILKES will makeamends for all In another placeand I believe another poemhe pants for fame and fondly fancies that some one straying in  the churchyard where he lies buried shall read his works over his grave by way of  epitaph  No bad stroke of vanity by the bye for the  manly  CHURCHILL But how would his dust feel if the gentleman by accident should hit upon  the above quotation  Every man has his motives for his public conduct mine arenotwithstanding the conjectures of a few unbelieving individualsneither more nor less than those I announce I will be free to acknowledge that in the prosecution of my scheme I have met with sore disappointments but these are the very spurs the very incentives to a further pursuit If I had retired upon meeting a rebuff or two what would have been the conclusion of my enemies  'This man fondly fancied himself a favourite of the public but they have convinced him they do not care threepence about him'  Having persisted they will see that it has procured me such friends as will silence the tongue of envy and blunt the poisoned arrows of malignity If CHURCHILL gloried in his WILKES what must I do when I can name more than twenty who  really possess  those valuable mental requisites which in his favourite he  doatingly fancied  The firm attachment and persevering kindness of that gentleman alone who made with me a circuit of more than seven hundred milesfirst left me at HULL and afterwards took his final leave at YORKis more than enough to compensate for all the arrogance ignorance and empty consequence that have disgraced those who could not distinguish between a fair and liberal compact with the public and the dirty impudence of a depredating itinerant It is true I did not acquire this gentleman's friendship in consequence of my tour I have possessed that pleasure for some years but it confirmed and strengthened it So many mortifications has he been witness to and so much has he pitied and commended me for a temporary perseveranceas the foundation of ultimate independencethat I am sure I have secured his valuable esteem upon so firm and permanent a basis that nothing can shake it Let me here assure him that the many and handsome instances of broad and generous liberality that I have repeatedly received both at the hands of  his father and himself neither time nor distance shall erase from my memory and that I never employed any moment to more grateful or pleasurable advantage than that when I have endeavoured to promote their interest which after all is but a mutual obligation between them and the public Many other very marking traits of friendship and attention you have already seen and many more are to come among which I cannot help noticing the kindness of a small number in LONDON where I protest I began to fear I had scarcely a friend The many struggles I have there made to enfranchise myself from the shackles of dependencethe general hurtful falacious opinion that I have often had fortune in my power but have wantonly and prodigally spurned the courteous benefit  The truth of this will he seen by an estimate of my pieces which having explained to a friend he assured me he thought it an information of a most  important  nature to the PUBLIC  laid so firm a foundation for the dexterous exertions of slander that like the mutilated picture of PRAXITILES I conceived myself in LONDONwhere any man's fame can be murdered with impunityto have been all  one blot  Happily however through the filth and dirtiness of all the malice sputtered out by irritated dulness and bursting envy a chosen few have been able to discern the neglected condition of an inoffensive traveller andlike the good Samaritan opened their hearts to a sense of his ill treatment Not that I mean to paint my case as a deplorable one No pride and my good spirits forbid it but there isas I have remarked beforesomething for me so winning so warm so exhilirating in spontaneous goodnature that I receive from it the same cheering and invigorating ray of genial comfort that a plant imbibes from the cherishing influence of the sun I shall hereafter particularize some of the instances to which I here only allude and will conclude this letter while my heart is full of the kindness of my  friend  and  fellowtraveller  above with saying that though I consider  "fame as an echo"  andas much as SHAKESPEAREhold it ridiculous to  "seek the bubble reputation in the cannon's month"  yet I hope demeaning myself with proper humility as a public character will not render me unfit for the  duties of private friendship or induce me to make an ill use of fortune should it ever be in my power Those will best command who know how to obey is an established maxim and I believe the best command and obedience within the exercise of the human mind is a peremptory subduction of all feelings but those which tend to the expansion of the heart and promote the wide and benevolent circulation of universal liberality and an implicit submission to all those moral duties which soften the manners humanize the soul and impel us to beneficent acts of general fraternal kindness that can alone  dignify reason  and lift us into MANLY PREEMINENCE  Adieu  Yours ever and truly Though indeed one implies the other C DIBDIN  Newcastle    February    LETTER XXXV  A STORM IN A DUCKPOND  "  Blow winds and burst your cheeks  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  HAVING pretty wellI hopequieted your scruples in my last letter I shall now proceed in my narrative whichlike the man with a black and white coat in the masqueradesometimes presents you with one colour and sometimes another You have seen the black side too much I confess but in future the white will be predominant I have men to introduce you to who will convince you that honesthearted liberality is not extinctbut they are stars that can shine without any borrowed lustre and therefore let them come in their place  At BEVERLY I first issued my proposals for printing this work after whichtaking one night at HULLI passed on to LINCOLN where my friend SOUTHERN was toldon his return from LONDONthey would be glad to see me On the fourth of Novemberfalling on a Sunday and being exactly ninetynine years since the memorable revolutionthe wind being almost due south very strong and squally accompanied with a severe and incessant rain I set sail from HULL to BARTON Nor is all this preparation unworthy the occasion I am sure I shall endure nothing in my voyage to INDIA that will exceed what I then experienced for if it did we should be all past endurance ANSON it is said was in the same situation and was  heard to exclaim that  "he feared after having been safely round the world it was his fate to be drowned in a fishpond"  But he escaped and so did I which I believe is all we can either of us say But to proceed  As we were getting out of the harbour a man fell overboard from a brig which lay very near us and disagreeable as the weather was three or four boats hastened immediately to his assistance but will it be believed that when they found he was an exciseman it was with the utmost difficulty they could be prevailed upon to afford him relief I declare to God I never felt so wretchedly in my life That private piques between admirals and generals should restrain their public exertions and so tarnish the glory of nations one does not wonder at that a judge should recommend a jury to find a man guilty rather than break through an established  etiquette  or lose his dinner that the  ax  should now and then be poised and the  halter  frequently stretched and the executioner glory in his dexterity that a merciless attorney for the sake of thirteen and fourpence should coolly advise his client to ruin a whole family none of these surpise one But that a set of wretches should mock the agony of an expiring fellowcreaturemerely because he was discharging a disagreeable office by the king's authorityis a wanton cruelty so unnecessary and so disgraceful that I sincerely hope it never was practised before nor will ever again The poor exciseman through much earnest persuasion was lodged safely in one of the boats and I had the pleasure before we got out of the harbour to see him standing upright At first however he seemed quite gone  'Damme the exciseman's dead'  cried one  'So much the better'  cried another  'he is gone to his father the devil then'  'No no'  said another  'he stirs he is only drunk'  'Ay ay'  said a  genteel man  on board our  sloop    'he could not help  tasting  he has been gauging you see the good liquor below Ha ha hathe dogs always drink more than they measure'  Many more things were said equally smart and equally humane For my part I thought I should stand but little chance by mixing in the conversationnot having wit enough to make calamity a subject  of merriment or stupidity to curb what would have been as impracticable a task as commanding the wind to be still which was then whistling in my ear  This nation pretty well knows that there are no people under the sun possess such consummate subtlety as the ITALIANSA man whose name is GRIMANI after he had been in ENGLAND about a month happenedas he was strolling aboutto find himself near BILLINGSGATESeeing him a foreigner he was presently hustled about and in short the fishwomen and watermen determined to give him what they called a complete  blackguarding  GRIMANIwho scarcely understood a word of Englishhearing the word  damn  frequently usedwas struck as quick as lightening with an idea that he should conquer them with their own weaponsHe thought he had nothing to do but think of a number of names unknown to the moband therefore begandamn CICEROdamn PLUTARCHdamn ARISTOTOLEdamn DEMOSTHENESdamn PLATOdamn ANAXAGERASdamn SCIPIOdamn HANNIBALdamn damn AGAMEMNONdamn damn ACHILLESand thus he went on with extreme volubility throwing his muscleswhich was a pretty easy thing to dointo the most frightful contortions till at length one of the mob cried out  'damme come along Jack we stand no chance with this fellow he blackguards ten times better than any one of us'  I therefore contented myself with seeing the gasping object of their pleasantry return to life and when that event was established sneaked into a corner of the cabbin to ruminate  The first thing that struck my attention was a dispute between the sailors whether they should take in two or three reefs in the mainsail and foresail the majority howeverbeing two to one for our ship's company consisted of no more than threewas in favour of the two reefs and presently we were a mile from land It now blew and rained very hard and three sailors who happened to be passengers came down into the cabin They were asked by the rest many questionsfor an universal terror had began to prevailand they all agreed that we carried too much sail but refused to interferefor they were  "not afraid of weatherbeside it was no concern of theirs"  The dissentient voice upon deck was continually heard to exclaim  "don't you see what short seas she ships Damme my lads but you'll repent not taking in another reef"  The other two swore she could carry every thing that was set and declared there was not a cap full of wind while the first as confidently affirmed 'it blew like the devil' For my part I always think that if those who  manage the ship do not feel themselves in danger I have no right to fancy I am but here being evidently a difference of opinion and the squalls so frequent strong and sudden I own I began to think with the sailors below that there was certainly a chance of  "our being capsized"  and this I had more opportunity to reflect upon than the rest being the only one out of more than forty passengers  two  of the sailors exceptednot seasick which I have in some moments since lamentedfor it has lost me a fine occasion to describe in imitation of Mr BARETTI all the various effects of that important and very delicate embellishment to the observations of a traveller though upon second thoughts I have been consoled with the reflection that it might have tainted my stile in all the rest of my narrative and made itlike hisas tasteless as warm water  After our poor little sloop had been buffetted three hours and forty minutes during which she above a hundred times as fairly dived as ever did a duck our sailors were so kind to run us aground at the mouth of BARTON harbourthe tide however still continuing to flow we were soon got off and at length arrived At which time the sailors who managed the vessel were not one whit drier than the poor halfdrowned exciseman  Being safely moored a long side of a cold ham I left care once more to the winds congratulating myself that there were yet some desirable considerations for which one would wish to live one of which has since turned out to be the enjoyment of that kindness you are pleased to afford to  Your obliged And faithful humble servant C DIBDIN  Newcastle    Feb    LETTER XXXVI  A TOUCH OF THE FORECASTLE  "  That such an oystershell should hold a pearl  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  IN the coach which carried me from BARTON to LINCOLN were two of those sailors who came passengers and who had been sent from LONDON to HULL and now were returning back to LONDON in search of a little prizemoney which had been due to them ever since the last war They said they did not know how such things came about but it had always been the way to send poor fellowswho earned their little at the risk of their livesfrom agent to agent till what they received was not worth having To be sure they might have saved their journey but they thought it was better to see into it themselves than trust their affairs in the hands of those landsharks the  lawyers  When Sir ELIJAH IMPEY was on his passage from INDIA he continually kept in the cabin from indisposition while her ladyship was in very good health and constantly on deck One fine day she coaxed him out to enjoy a little air and as he was walking the deckit having blowed pretty hard the preceding daya  shark  was playing by the side of the ship Having never seen such an object before he called to one of the sailors to tell him what it was Being asked the question  "why don't you know an please your honour"  said honest JACK  'No'  said Sir ELIJAH  'what is the name of it'  "Why"  replied the Tar  "I don't know what name they hail 'em by ashore but here we call 'em  sea lawyers  "  That there was something wrong but they hoped one day or other every thing would be righted for they were sure  when his majestyGod bless himcame to know how the poor honest fellows were served who manned his woodenwalls some of the understrappers would get a  salt eel  This was one instance out of a great many in which I have had opportunity to notice the strong intellectual feelings of sailors They are honest and liberal to a proverb and it has been remarked that public depredators who have gone to church to pick pockets have been converted into good citizens on the forecastle of a man of war A friend of mine says  "their honesty and good sense are fully accounted for by considering that they have very little commerce with mankind owing to this they despise money and therefore have no inducement to become knaves and as their wants are few and those soon supplied they have no occasion to rack imagination to keep up a constant deception in their words and actions Thus their ideas go immediately to the point they want to express and their tongues transmit those ideas faithfully and without embellishment"  I must do my friend the justice to confess that he gives us here a very ingenious argument and for so very extensive a theme as pithy a one as any of those for which the sailors receive from him such warm encomiums It is certain honestly and good sense are very congenial and I should sooner suspect that an argument which threw out a strong and brilliant display of logical and rhetorical figures was calculated to  disguise  rather than  ornament  THE TRUTH I have certainly in the course of an hour heard a  sailor  utter as many good thingsand I am sure with as little affectationas Dr JOHNSON Nor do their technical allusions rob what they say of its beauty  The character of  Kit Keel  in the  Touchstone  came with meon my return to ENGLANDin the coach from DOVER to ROCHESTER His real name is SPRAT and he is a  pilot  at HARWICHThe words I there set down he uttered And can there be any thing more striking than  "Money was made for our friends and the landlords along ashore"  Or again  "My money's my friend's my heart my wife's and my life my country'smy name is SPRAT which he really said and that's my way of thinking"  I declare I never witnessed a greater fund of wit than that he possessed in my life Speaking of fashionssaid he  "I'll tell you what Before I went my last voyage my POL d'ye see stowed every thing snug the hatches were properly battened down sail set modesty used sparingly decently reefed nothing shook in the wind and there was enough spare canvass in the old chest in case of weather When I came homeonly an eighteen months voyageDamme if I did'nt think I had got among the WANGHEES or some lubberly outlandish place where they dress themselves up in feathersThere they weresprit sails and studding sailsevery thing set they could carry and more toI sayI expected to see them every minute bottom upwards Well thinks I to myself this won't he the case with my POLWould you believe itShiver my jib if POL was not as bad as the best of 'em You see before I sailed I could take her little tight head tuck it under my arm and give her a hearty smackNow Damme every time I went to salute her I stuck my eyes full of black pins"  A ship is a glorious epitome of the world and its management is the strongest instance of ingenuity that human invention has furnished us  With these sailors in the coach I held some conversation concerning our narrow escapefor they assured me it might be so calledand they said it arose from this the men who in conduct those passage boats are in general tolerable pilots but bad sailors they said this I might have noticed not only by their neglecting to take in more than two reefs but keeping the sails continually shivering in the windby which means we lay at the mercy of every squall and the vessel had so many different motions that she shipped twice the sea she would have done had they laid her fairly close to the water I mention this the more particularly because I think it will operate as a good caution to all those who draw the conclusionwhich I didthat if the people themselves will venture the passengers are in no danger when at the same time we have every day so many instances of peoples losing their lives through foolhardiness  Not a fortnight after I came from HULL there was an account in one of the papers of  thirteen people  that were lost in crossing the SEVERN  The journey to LINCOLN having been in proportion as disagreeable as the passage to BARTON I was glad after a slight supper to get to bedwhere the  whole night I was tossing about in the HUMBER nor could I believe I was really in an inn when I awakened for never were those lines in  Hudibras  more applicable  "On a sudden  "By a huge clamour and a loud one  "As if all sorts of noise had been  "Collected into one loud din  "Or that a member to be chosen  "Had got the odds above a thousand  "And by the greatness of his noise  "Prov'd fittest for his country's choice"  This noise having awakened meand I your curiosityI shall postpone an explanation of it to my next letter being in the interim  Yours very faithfully C DIBDIN  Newcastle    February    LETTER XXXVII  ENGLISH AMUSEMENT  "  Can there be any cause in nature  "  "  For these hard hearts  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I lay I am sure half an hour before I could form the most distant conjecture of what this noise could proceed from Bells kettles horns hallowing hooping huzzaing by men women and children conveyed to my drowsy fancy a noise more horrible than did the angry billows which lashed the yawning cavern of the six mouthed SCYLLA to the affrighted mariners of ULLUSSES for I will not suppose but that HE  delighted in the danger  At length by a few oblique words which catched my ear I was let into the secret It was the  fifth of November  and the mob were carrying about a figure of GUY FAUX which they informed me when I came down to breakfast was a ceremony performed on this day at LINCOLN with great  regularity  and  solemnity  and that there was also to be a bullbaiting at twelve o'clock and another at four I enquired particularly  where  and was told if I wanted places to see it I must be very expeditious for they were not only dear but perhaps all bespoke My answer was that I only asked that I might avoid so disagreeable a sight I received nothing but a contemptuous  look for my declaration and was extremely mortified to find that I unfortunately run into the very predicament I was so studious to avoid for though I did not see the bull  baited  I was by accident so hemmed in that I could not avoid witnessing the miserable lacerated condition of the poor creature afterwardsand they were then leading him to where he was to be again baited in the afternoon Heavenly God I have heard of savages who have tortured their prisoners and afterwards eat thembut I could find something like a motive for this A bull is baited we are told to make him eat tenderlet him be hunted thenlet him become the fair victim of the chacelet us feel nobly like our ancestors nor degenerate from the brave EARL OF WARWICK by  cruelly cowardly  tying a noble animal to the stake and stimulating a number of peaceful domestic creatures to worry him that human brutes may relish their dinner I am told at STAMFORD they let the bull loose after baiting itif so I most sincerely hope the next time that event takes place he may toss the first man who sets a dog at him Lions  tear  their prey Hyenas  betray  itbut these are provoked only by the calls of hunger But a wanton unnecessary crueltyto which there cannot be a possible incentive but savage hardness of heartis a  refinement  on brutality reserved alone for the ANIMAL OF REASON and to make the case more lamentable this most contemptible of all unmanly pastimes is the peculiar disgrace of the bravest nation upon earth  TOM CLOUGHan under strapper for many years at Drurylane theatrewas the man of all others who had the truest genuine taste for the English amusements A cockfight was his delighta bullbaiting was to him as delicious a repast as a turtle feast to an aldermanbut a hanging matchHe called one morning on a friend to accompany him to Tyburnwhich place he as punctually attended as a hypocritical bigot would a place of devotionHis friend however neither chusing to be waked so early in the morning nor relishing this diversion gave him a good round volly of abuse and sent him away The other giving him a contemptuous look swore he would never speak to him again  'for damme'  said he  'my maxim is never to have any thing to do but with  people of  TASTE  Mr CLOUGH's accounts of the conduct of the different COCKS as he called themthat he had seen  die  would fill a pretty large duodecimo which might not be unaptly called  The Newgate Jest Book  When I first came to  Drurylane Theatre  I used to listen to some of his remarks in the  matted room  His doctrine fairly was that thieves in this country are so little checked in their approach to the gallows that they go on methodically professionally step by step till they are what the  informers  call worth  forty pounds  and as these principles are inculcated from their infancy they talk as naturally and with as much unconcern of their deathbed at  Tyhurn  as a sailor leaps into that hammock in which he may be sewed up or a sensualist enters between sarsinct sheets to press that mountain of down where he is born to become a prey to the gout or stoneI shall upon a future occasion endeavour to recollect some of his anecdoteswhich I truly believe are not exaggerationsThe only execution I ever saw in ENGLAND was at WINCHESTER when I was about fourteen years old I declare to heaven I heard one of the poor hardened wretchesnot ten minutes before they were turned offask a sheepstealerhis companionif he should like a bit of mutton BANNISTER repeatsor has inventeda very witty thing said by Jack Ketch as he was tying the halter A culprit asked him  'if he had any commands to the other world'    "Why"  said Jack  "not muchI'llonly"  added he as he adjusted the knot under his left ear  "  Justtrouble you  WITH A LINE"  I performed at LINCOLN three nightsthe second of which was tolerably well but the first and last miserably bad Dr KAYE was unfortunately  while I stayed but a few hours in town He attended me however and had the goodness to send me afterwards a polite invitation which I am sorry I could not accept Mr MONEY to whom I am almost wholly indebted for the little company I had gave me proof of as liberal attention as I have any where met with In short I believe through that gentleman's means every body was asked though so very few chose to come In the round of invitations however it would be an unpardonable omission if I neglected to mention the excuse of one gentleman with whom I  think  I had the honour of riding in the stage coach to NEWARK This gentleman was pressed very hard to go to my entertainment and would have been there he said with great pleasure if there had been  no music  I hope this gentleman is a  bull baiter  At length being very closely pressed he said  "you know my  detestation  of  music  and if you will only prevail on Mr DIBDIN to introduce something  to abuse it  in order to give colour to my appearing there I will go with all my heart"  I hope it will be allowed that this is one of the most curious anecdotes I have yet recorded  I here pay my acknowledgements to Mr VANEIL to whom my friend SOUTHERN introduced me by letter for his very kind attention to me both at LINCOLN and at NEWARK in which he did honour to his friends recommendation and to me particular service  I must endeavour before I leave LINCOLN to account a little for the capriciousness I experienced There is a  high town  and a  low town  and they are as much at variance as the MONTAGUES and the CAPULETS Thus the place having separate interests and taken aggregately standing upon a very limited circumference and containing but a scanty number of inhabitants it is madness to think of an entertainment there A playhouse at LINCOLN I should suppose must be in this predicament if it was situate on the hill it must be all  boxes  if under the hill all  gallery  and if in the midway all  pit  and as a playhouse cannot live but by  box pit  and  gallery  COLLECTIVELY I should conceive the last place for the drama in this kingdom is LINCOLN  From LINCOLN I went to NEWARK where I performed one night to a very thin audience who promised great things if I would return in the course of another week This being in my power I did so and met with no better success Upon soliciting LADY LINCOLN however I received a most generous and elegant answer appointing a night and giving me the liberty to make use of her name and LORD LINCOLN's This produced me as good a night as I believe the place can afford and manifested one instanceamong many I have experiencedthat  real  distinction dignifies itself by easy and amiable affability while all the pride and ostentation of affected consequencelike a deformed figure conspicuously situatedsolicits contempt when by a decent conscious humiliation it might command respect But it is the nature of folly to expose itself  I have ever remarked that the crooked women are always the first to go without cloaks the ugliest to expose their faces and those with thick legs  are sure to wear short petticoats I am returning to NEWARK when I shall illustrate this and some other positions in the mean time beg your company to NOTTINGHAM where your warm wishes for my ill success will be fully gratified where little BURBAGEafter receiving a  good price  for the billscould not help remarking that it was a damned shabby business But I believe there is no more cause in nature for  thick heads  than  hard hearts  therefore let us blame not those who do not enjoy the pleasures of goodfellowship and sociality equal to ourselves but rather thank providence for giving us the charming enjoyment of that sort of sensation I feel when I tell you I am  Yours very truly C DIBDIN  Durham    February    LETTER XXXVIII  A JAUNT FROM POST TO PILLAR  "  Promise crammedyou can't feed Capons so  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I thank you for your impromptuI deserve it and a great deal more  On hearing of Mr  DIBDIN's  ill success at  NOTTINGHAM  Were you mad or bewitch'dthus 'mongst nature's worst dregs  The effusions of genius to shed  Aspiring no higher than sitting of LEGS  How should they know what's  fit  for the HEAD  but one cannot be always infallible Who for instance would have believed that  genteel  DERBY should on my return have served me as scurvy a trick as  shabby  NOTTINGHAM I had the folly to linger on three nights each of which was to be great things and turned out nothing at all  Let me however before I mention the particulars of these matters bring you upas the sailors sayas to the time and place My first night at NEWARK was on the tenth of November I then went to NOTTINGHAM had one night proceeded to DERBY and returned to NEWARK to perform on the  seventeenth  then to give opportunity for the night bespoke by LADY LINCOLN I went to GRANTHAM and returned to NEWARK for the performance on the  twentyfourth  I found DERBY split into factions in consequence of the establishment of a new assembly the etiquette of which could not be settled to the general satisfaction One lady was desirous of being queen or conductress and this gave offence to the rest Thus the partizans of Mrs A turned up their noses at the friends of Mrs B while Mrs Cwhose adherents were also numerousretorted the contempt upon them both and in her turn was saluted with a whole volly of gibes and sarcasms by the staunch abettors of Mrs D A decent poet might have picked up something tolerable among them for satires and lampoons How it operated with me is very apparent Water and oilfire and icemodern music and geniuscould not be more inimical than were these parties to each other If I would have performed four times in the day I might have had them all separately but together no consideration upon earth could have induced them to mix One lady certainly did trifle with me in a strange kind of waybut as no longer ago than yesterday I received intelligence that she subscribes for four copies I should hope matters were misrepresented to me for as to her uneasiness lest I should introduce her into my TOURwhich has also been hintedI cannot suppose she has any apprehensions on that account To be sure her conduct was a good deal like the ladies at BATH she did appoint a time for me when nobody could be there and afterwards made me keep a company waiting more than an hour under an idea that she was coming at the head of a large partyand at length sent word that neither they nor her could attend methough she knew the performance of that night was an additional one in compliment to her  The most curious treatment I met with at DERBY was from old surly DREWRY the printer This grossly ignorant  man of letters  took it into his headbecause I thought proper to pay some attention to Mr PRITCHARD who was once under him and to whom he cannot have the smallest objection except that he begins very fast to take away his customto be offended and the method he took of shewing his resentment was to charge halfacrown a hundred for the same sort of bills which he had printed the first time I was  there for eighteenpence I really thought an  advance  of forty per cent even in so trifling a business was worth a remonstrance This was what he wanted He boiled with rage and the truth came out I asked him how he would like to be put in the TOUR  "Damme"  said he  "clap me up in your  Tower  at your peril"  I told him I always did what I was dared to and here he may perceive I am as good as my word My discovery however has nothing new in ithis overbearing purseproud ignorant consequence are as much known in DERBY as the accommodating modest and obliging behaviour of MR PRITCHARDthe object of his envyand it will have this operation in proportion as one grows malicious the other will be prosperous I mention this circumstance with some regret as it is the only instance of incivility I have to this day met with from printers To  all  I am indebted for some kindness to MANY for much civility and kind attention and to SOME FEW for a liberality and friendly solicitude which will ever make the warmest impression on me even little BURBAGEas far as it consists with a  money getting man  I sincerely believe would do any thing to serve me  I returned to NEWARK on Friday the twentysixth and took up my abode with honest worthy JEMMY WALLIS who keeps the  Wing Tavern  and makes  monuments  being at once employed on  feasting the living  and  commemorating the dead  Nor is he more inadequate to one than the other his  cellar  is as full of  good wine  as his  head  of  tasty  and  neat ornaments  But as no man is better beloved or studied to do me more friendly offices so my panegyric even were it twenty times as strong will answer no other purpose than that of doing common justice to a valuable character Some indeed may blame me for telling the world of the merits of a man only particularly known at NEWARKand cry out  'what is Mr WALLIS's wine to me who shall never drink any of it'  Sir RICHARD STEEL had his ESTCOURT and why should not I have my WALLIS No ESTCOURT upon earth ever deserved to be better spoken of The only difference is the two pens are not alike equal to the task which certainly is not an unworthy one for it has  drawn from the editor of the  Spectator  in that nervous touching eulogium which he concludes with saying the pen drops out of his handone of the brightest effusions of his genius It is true this beautiful glowing tribute of warm friendship to private worth deplores the  death  of ESTCOURT while WALLISthough every day recording the deceased virtues of otherskeeps a state of robust health that seems like a towering elm to defy the depredations of time  The history of my jaunt to GRANTHAMduring the preparation for LADY LINCOLN's nightwas this I took a letter to a gentleman who told me he could do me no manner of service and in particular that he could not be present on the first night of my performance Finding however that LORD and LADY BROWNLOW and some other people of distinction were there he came also but advised me not to have another night till the following week to which I did  not  consent He however propagated that I  did  and in consequence nobody attended This gentleman's kind conduct was owing to his being director of the GRANTHAM concert and it is evident he feared that if I drew too much company  his  appearance would be but thin All this Mr F SHARP can testify for me who was very solicitous to oblige and do me service This nonsense and the arrival of the DUKE OF RUTLAND's corpse sent me back to NEWARK to prepare for the next Saturday and set JEMMY WALLIS a cursing the GRANTHAMITES  From the evening of my performance at the desire of LORD and LADY LINCOLN I date the commencement of my itinerant prosperity whichdiffering from the matter in this letter as widely as  earth  and  air  will be the subject of another and I shall finish it as I do this with complete sincerity by assuring you that I am most faithfully  Yours C DIBDIN  Durham    Feb    LETTER XXXIX  LOCAL MATTER  "  To catch the living manners as they rise  "  And boldly shoot at folly as it flies  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  AT GRANTHAM on the d of November I received a letter from Mr HARRIS the contents of which I shall defer mentioning till I go over that matter regularly Before I left NEWARK for GRANTHAM in order to accommodate LORD and LADY LINCOLN I made an application respectively to the corporation for use of the assembly room and having obtained leave  individually  I was astonished to find on my return that  collectively  they objected to it In consequence of this I found myself unpleasantly situated I was relieved however from my anxiety by Mr MIDGELEY who keeps the  Kingston Arms  the history of which house in a former letter I promised to give in its place Mr MIDCELEY offered to let me have his large room gratis and I accepted the offer in consequence of which I fancy he expects to be spoken very well of in this publication and handsomely recommended to the notice of  people of fashion  whose accommodationto the great annoyance of  stagecoach travellers  and  bagmen  he very anxiously studies I shall however go no step further than the truth to oblige all the Mr MIDGELEYS upon earth And the truth is this When I first passed through NEWARKas I mention in its placeI ate a dinner remarkably  well dressed and in consequence returned to the same house I then found that the landlord had been cook to the PRINCESS DOWAGER OF WALES and that the house was famous for culinary excellence I therefore indulged myself in two or three favourite dishes the merits of which I so loudly chaunted the praise ofhaving eaten them in perfection in FRANCEthat he I suppose fancied me UN MY LOR Finding however I wasaccording to the mayor of NOTTINGHAMonly an  actor man  I suppose by what followed he was determined to be revenged of me for being innocently the cause of his paying me a little respect He therefore gave me a miserable bad pair of horses to NOTTINGHAM one of which fell down and detained me half an hour on the road and though he promised that he would very faithfully take care of any letters that might be directed for me to his house yet he refused some that were brought in my absence which but for the kindness of JEMMY WALLIS I should notwithout great difficultyhave received When he found LORD and LADY LINCOLN had bespoke a night the tables were turned again and it was impossible with all his consequence to put on a more fulsome shew of adulation If he thought this was the way to procure my praise he will find by reading the above how far he succeeded  NEWARK like MALTON in some degree failed owing to my having imprudently placed my dependance on a  parson  and a  lawyer  but in return I became acquainted with another attorney who paid me much attention and without an interested motive I therefore record the circumstance according to my promise as one of those which in all my lifemuch less during my tourI have seldom had the good fortune to meet with  On Sunday the twentyfifth I arrived at DONCASTER and that evening paid my respects to Dr MILLER I own I had nohopes of this place and if I had entertained any they would have been baulkedfor it was like DERBY  divided into parties each of which seemed determined to deprive itself of its own pleasure rather than not disturb the tranquillity of its neighbour  This instance in country towns of destroying that sociality which they seem so peculiarly situated for the enjoyment of is astonishing Some author mentions a circumstance of four persons who were going to the land's end in a stage coach The first twenty miles they all spoke together further on they were the best friends in the world but were content with speaking one at a time presently they all yawned by and by fell asleep and before they parted cordially wished one another at the devil Now all this is natural enough These people were never to meet again But the first idea of settling in the country is a sociable neighbourhood and as those who are so situated must necessarily be near each other during a number of dull months common policy would induce them one should think to give and receive as much rational pleasure as possible But pride attends every situation in life Mrs DOUBLE TRIPE the cook looks with contempt on the scullion Mrs HANDY my lady's maid addresses Mrs DOUBLE TRIPE by the title of  good woman  Mrs CRINGE the toadeater sneers superciliously at Mrs HANDY while she in her turn is huffed and dinged about by My LADY and blamed for putting her out of humour spoiling her complexion and losing her lovers A  corporal  is as proud of relieving a  centinal  as a  general  of commanding an  army  and a  strolling actor  is as much a monarch for the time being as the EMPEROR of GERMANY  A foolish  stagestruck  young man ran away from his friends and got among a most low and miserable set of strollers A relation after a time discovered him just as he was going on to the stage in KING RICHARD and on reading him a pretty severe lecture on his folly and disobedience received an answer suitable to all the ridiculous consequence and assumed pomp of a mock monarch To which he answered  'these are fine lofty words but 'tis a great pity Mr KING RICHARD that you could not afford to buy a better pair of shoes'  The actor looking at his toes which were staring him in the facewithout loosing his vivacitycried out  "shoesOh damme shoes are things we KINGS don't STAND UPON"  At DONCASTER the ladies of independent fortune had established an assembly and finding on a former occasion they were intruded on by others of inferior distinction they came to a resolution of admitting no tradesman nor any of his family to the assembly This of course gave umbrage to the major part of the place who in return determined to have an assembly apart Here for a little time the matter rested and it must have been no unpleasant thing to see the lower house muster numerously when the upper house could get scarcely any members to attend it At length this second assembly began to divide Miss LATITAT the attorney's daughter made Mrs FRIZ the barber's wife no  return  to her curtsey while Mrs PTISIC the physician's lady sneered at the upstart consequence of Miss BUMPER the innkeeper's daughter and wondered that she should have the impudence to  precribe  rules of good breeding to her A second division was the consequence and a third meeting formed which for distinction was called the  checked apron assembly  This caprice destroyed every expectation of enjoyment among them their meetings being ill attendedand of course unsociableinstead of answering the desired purpose produced nothing but envy bickering and discord and were a sample of rational manners to be taken from them would give an idea that human creatures were born to plague instead of accommodate each other All this would have been the consequence at NEWARK which LADY LINCOLN very sensibly foreseeingwith an amiable complacency truly nobleheaded the assembly and dispensed her favours with so equal a hand that it caused every where an emulationnot to assume false consequence but imitate true greatness  DIOGENES being asked how he could live in a  nasty tub  when he might bask in the favour of a  court  repliedIt is true I am deprived of the smiles of KINGS but I don't find the  sun  is more ashamed of my  tub  than a  palace  Yours very truly C DIBDIN  Sheffield    March    LETTER XL  ANOTHER CLERICAL CHARACTER AND A THOUSAND MUSICAL ONES  "  While in a heap the jarring atoms lay  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I shall trouble you with nothing concerning the entertainment at DONCASTER which I did but twiceeach time to a loss Not however to be inconsistent I stick to my assertion that my plan began to brighten up at DONCASTER The business of the subscription went on pretty fast and I received such good intelligence from WAKEFIELD LEEDS and other places that I could no longer doubt of good success Besides DONCASTER introduced me to the intimacy of Dr MILLER and the countenance of Mr DRUMMOND who I sincerely hope will not be offended if according to my pursuit of common justice I take the liberty to speak of him It is not however necessary to say muchfor when it is known that a clergyman is venerated by his neighbourhoodthat the poor among his parishioners look up to him as a fatherthat he is the benefactor of meritthe comforter of the helplessthat born largely to enjoy the promiscuous blessings of life his sole delight is the rational and enchanting pleasures centered in the amiable duties of a husband and a fatherand then add that this example of human perfection is no more than  twentysix  I believe it will be pretty difficult to advance any thing stronger on the subject I cannot however debar myself the pleasure of relating one circumstancein corroboration  of the abovewhich happened while I was there The small poxof a confluent and fatal kindhad raged very violently and was continually sweeping off numbers of the inhabitantsMr DRUMMOND having attended several burials determined to stop as much as in his power the progress of this alarming evil preached a sermon full of good sense and strong feeling in favour of inoculation and afterwards proclaimed that those who chose to have their children inoculated might do so at his expence So blind however is human folly that but nine applied while I stayed One poor woman being asked why she did not avail herself of Mr DRUMMOND's goodness answered  'I thank God my children are all blessed angels in heaven'  I was in the whole a week at DONCASTER which I passed very happily in the company of Dr MILLER I know no man of more liberal sentiments nor whose studies are applied to more worthy purposes His public letter concerning the  musical fund  and advice towards the establishment of such an institution in the country is full of generous spirited and sensible remarks and it will do him lasting honour that his plan has already been in some measure adopted His institutes are another proof of his wishes to make his abilities of public use They are a work calculated to reduce the study of music to something like rule in the nature of a grammar and for a first attempt in this wayfor he was very conscious that any thing of such a kind would be considered as a dangerous innovationhas great perspicuity and may be made generally serviceable But here I must tell Dr MILLER and the public a secret The masters as they are called fearing their mysteries should be revealed which like the glorious uncertainty of the law is the source of emolument decry this work of his whenever they can and make their scholars believe it is only capable of teaching them a few superficial rules whereas their whole fear is lest it draw aside the veil of imposition and discover that deception by which they contrive to lead on a scholar in the course of two or three years to the knowledge of what they might upon a plain easy simple principle accomplish in a few weeks His elements of thorough bass is another  ingenious work He seems to have kept RAMEAU strongly in mind and he could nottempered with his own observationshave had a better model I am only sorry he did not keep to those useful positions which so dumbfound theorists as they are calledsuch as maintaining that there is not in the system of harmony any thing more than the common chord and the seventhsince by shewing how abstruse resolutions may be made every man will not take the matter upon the ground of its being a severe satire on  mere  professors but suppose he countenances the introduction of such chords It is certain his book would have tended more to simplify harmony without it But then he would have had all the cavillers in full cry after himand every man is not obliged to set himself the Herculean task of a reformer He therefore gave them two roads whichlike those of virtue and viceone is flowery and the other rugged Perhaps he did wisely Those who would be pleased with little trouble will chuse  simplicity  for their guidethose who would search and never come to the end of their journey will follow  difficulty  I cannot introduce  music  so wellfor I confess to you I mean now to dwell some time on that subjectas by a description of  musicians  nor  musicians  as by speaking of the  musical fund  This institution is too well known to need a statement of its origin rise and progress The newspapers give frequent accounts of the thousands which are continually pouring into its coffers But does any one know what becomes of them Is such an institution worthy the benevolent contribution of hundreds and the august patronage of a great powerfuland what is more incomparably morea good and beneficent monarch which suffers the neglected dust of the matchless ARNE to lie without a stone to tell where it perishes Who can suppress his indignation when he considers that the widow of this great manold and friendlessapplied to this societyso supported so patronizedand went away with the tear of distress on her check started by the language of reproof And what think ye was the excuse for this unfeeling refusal  'Dr ARNE had been it was true one of the most ancient members of the musical fund he had  many years given it countenance and support his oratorios had produced it good benefits and'  which one would think was a stronger argument than all the rest  'his catches and glees had caused half the drunkenness and disorder that pervaded their convivial meetings when the reckoning was paid out of the stockbut there was a law which subjected any member to a sentence of expulsion if he or she should neglect to subscribe his or her quota for four several times and Dr ARNE having been in IRELAND and so guilty of this neglect he and his were for ever cut off from any claim to be relieved by the fund'  The widow of MICHAEL ARNE applied with as little success There was something in this case whispered about difference of opinion in religion If it be true it can only be said that the best names may be prostituted to the vilest purposes It is curious at any rate to talk of the religious sentiments of musicians Harmony in its extensive and universal acceptation is certainly allied to a contemplation of that great and expanded symmetry and grace which so wonderfully qualify and knit together the various contrarieties on the face of nature through the influence of contending elements into one concordant wholebut for the members of the musical fund to draw an inference from the similitude of music to moral or revealed religionlisten to the calls of humanityor indeed make any use of their stock except to relieve their tools and gratify their own luxurious pleasureswould be a species of harmony beyond their capacity for it is founded in  nature  it opens to  benevolence  and  modulating  through all the fine and exquisite feelings of nice honour and smiling philanthropy it closes in that best of  keys  the HEART  A consideration of Dr MILLER's public letter and a further investigation of this  charitable institution  shall be the subject of my next after which I shall open my cause in form of NATURE  versus  THEORY The first I take to be the state of music after the chaos and the latter so sweetly described  by DRYDEN  "while in a heap of jarring atoms lay"  to which state in the minds of many of its professors have the want of fancy the absence of taste and the dearth of genius again reduced itfar removed from the harmony of the soul and of course from that pleasure with which I repeat so often that I am  Most sincerely Yours C DIBDIN  Sheffield    March    LETTER XLI  CROTCHETS AND QUAVERS  "  The King should know it  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  DR MILLER addresses himself in his first letter to the noblemen and gentlemen managers of the different festivals in commemoration of HANDEL praying that the musicians in the country as well as those resident in LONDON may be entitled to some relief from that fund which their labours help to accumulate He truly says that charity ought not to be confined to any particular place and urges a variety of strong arguments to support his laudable purpose His second letter is to the directors of  the fund  itselfwhom he advises to admit regular country musicians as members He strenuously appeals to their feelings as men and professors of the same artinstances the numerous charities for whose emolument musicians perform gratis He exclaims  "unfortunate professors of a noble science Unhappy sons of an unnatural parent who while she procures wealth and comfort to others suffers her own children to pine in misery and want"  This effort to procure relief for country musicians is however as extravagantly absurd as it is nobly liberal What have the noblemen and gentlemen to do with dispensing the profit of the Abbey festivals It is sifted as often  as flour andaccording to honest JOEit would be wonderful if some of it did not stick by the way I have had very particular opportunity to notice that if nothing else disgraces the king's patronage in the business of the festivals the paltry haggling bargains that are made with the country musiciansand all in the names of these noblemen and gentlemen who know nothing about itare a scandal to any set of men who boast the smallest pretensions to exercise a liberal profession In short it islike every thing of that kinda job And how should it be otherwise Instead of placing at the head of it such men as Dr HAYES and Dr BURNEY the power is vested in subordinate musicians who like COLONEL COCKBURN never get rid of the  black hole  the  gin  and the  cato'ninetails  This  noble commander  because he could not conceal it was continually boasting of his rise from a private man His constant expression was  "did you ever see me do so and so when I was a private soldier"  One day in the island of St EUSTATIUS as he was reviewing the troops he took notice of a man in the ranks who was very dirty Going up to himsaid he  "How dare you appear in that nasty conditionyour shirt's as black as ink Did you ever see me with such a dirty shirt"  'No your honour'  answered the man  'to be sure your honour I never didbut then your honour will please to recollect that your honour's mother  was a washer woman  '  And these by this appointment are to dictate to men under whose command common policy says they ought to march Can any thing therefore be so futile and ineffectual as an attempt to turn such a tide as thisover which these men are the moon and contrive to influence it into that channel where it can ebb and flow at their pleasure  As to the letter to the directors of the fund itself how could a man of Dr MILLER's good sense expect to have it noticed Will a miser spare a single guinea out of his iron chest to save a life or a drunkard a single drop out of his pint bumper Poor men their fund amounts at present but to thirtythree thousand pounds and I declarethough I have had pretty nearly as much to do with the musical tribe as any manI do not know at this moment any one object who derives a benefit from this charity  These letters however though they could make no impression on that marble to which they were addressed nevertheless roused the resolutions of a few hopeless men whoamong a number of othershad been the sport of that ignorant arrogance that distinguishes the  horn  and  kettledrum  which make up the factotum of this wisely and honestly conducted institution  There is a young man whom from the following circumstance alone I hope to take by the hand in INDIA He was bred to musicbut seventeenand fearing the ill consequences of keeping company with musicians in LONDON he resolved to go abroadfirst sending a letter to his father in which were these words  "The men I am obliged to mix with are so  ignorant  so  envious  and so  profligate  that I dread should I stay among them what might happen to inexperience like mine"  Mr SMARTwho keeps a music shop in OXFORDSTREET and is also a performerapplied to become a member of the musical fund Mr SMART happens to be one of those very few who are blest with good intellects and it is not wonderful that he should in his life have differed in opinion from these consequential musical COCKBURNS at the head of the harmonic army There could not be any possibly legitimate reason for getting rid of his application yet dismissed it must be  "because why"  said one  "if we lets that there feller come among us damme but he'll be up to the rig presently"  As my book is to be read at many places in the country and should not of course be merely calculated for the meridian of LONDON I may as well write to be generally understood I have always thought that there is nothing like making a man tell his own story It is the moment of all others when his heart is most to be seen His habits manners affections and foibles are then so exposed that a tolerably sagacious observer may very easily discover the spot where he is most vulnerable besides it is unfair to rob a man's expressions of any of their brilliancy For these and other reasons equally cogent I shall always endeavour as strongly as possible to place my actors within the mental perception of my readersin the stile however of the ancient drama acting myself the part of a chorus by way of giving a general explanation to all those passages that would otherwise be inexplicable owing to idiom custom profession or locality The instance above is one of the strongest I shall have the necessity to adduce There is a language or lingo in LONDON in the opinion of rhetoricians of a very beautiful kindfor it is entirely figurativecalled SLANG This PATTERwhich is another of its namesis frequently in the mouths of musicians who by imitating the inhabitants of St GILES'swhence this elegant improvement on the vulgar tongue boasts its originin their manners debaucheries and even the  compilation  of NEW MUSIC adopt also their very mode of expression I will not pretend to say that I shall always make myself perfectly clear but when I find I cannot I shall have for consolation the recollection that one of these St GILES's birds once so confounded LORD MANSFIELD that he was obliged to let him go without being able to gather any thing from his evidencebut then this gentleman was an  adept  whereas musicians neither in language nor any thing else aspire to more than  imitation  The trial was concerning some quarrel in the street and the KIDDYthe gentleman's  slang name  was to give an account of all he knew  "Why"  said he  "my Lord as I was coming by the corner of the street I  stagged  the man"  'Pray'  said LORD MANSFIELD  'what is  stagging  a man'  "  Stagging  my Lord why you see I was  down upon him  "    'Well but I don't understand  down upon him  any more than I do  stagging  him Do speak to be understood'  "Why you see my Lordand please your lordshipI speaks as well as I can I was  up  d'ye see me  to all he knew  "  'To all he knew I am as much in the dark as ever'  "Well then my Lord I'll tell you how it was"  'Ayenow'  "Why seeing as how he was a  rum kid  I was  one upon his tibby  "  In short he was sent out of court and was heard in the hall to say to one of his companions that he hud gloriously  queered  old FULL BOTTOM  At length an idea was suggestedfor which the person who started it received the thanks of the meetingthat it being a rule for every proposed member to give in an account of his situation and the state of his family Mr SMART had certainly produced a paper saying he had a wife and four children but in so doing his intention must have been to impose  on the charity for at the very time he delivered in that paper so worded he well knew Mrs SMART was pregnant of her  fifth  child It was moved and carried that Mr SMART had endeavoured to get admission as a member of the  musical fund  by surreptitious means and therefore should never be entitled to any benefit from it  It was after this transaction that Dr MILLER's letter got into Mr SMART's hands he consulted a few others and by dint of a laudable perseverance a NEW FUND is actually established which already consists of a decent sum and has the sanction of many gentlemen of both worldlyas well as professionalrank and consequence  This letter will rouse the charitable musicians more than all the rods with which I mean to tingle them hereafter but I defy them to controvert it Dr HOWARD has an hundred times declared that it was an iniquitous  business Dr BURNEY said some time ago he had washed his hands of them and they will never get over the respectable meeting at the freemasons' tavern where their scandalous conduct was so severely reprobated and the NEW FUND so liberally contributed to In short while the  living  professors of a liberal art are totally discouraged men of real genius will naturally turn their thoughts to something else obliged however to deplore that promotions in  science  like those in the  army  and  navy  go not by  merit  but  interest  and that in future to aspire to musical preferment you must begin by being a fifer in the guards These are the schools as Mrs PEACHUM says which produced so many great men I will venture to say SIMPSON the hautboy player has done more injury to the cause of  real genius  to which he was a stranger himself and therefore hated it in all mankindthan all the festivals in commemoration of HANDEL will ever do good  I shall give a strong instance of this when I speak of  Love in the City  an Opera performed at  Coventgarden Theatre  I do not however pretend to say that the guards have not assisted the cause of music in this country very materially The two PARKES FORSTER poor HOLLAND and many others are convincing proofs that it is the best nursery for wind instrumental performers in this kingdom But surely these are not to be put in competition with men by means of whose expanded fancy and fine judgment are  conceived  those delicious sounds which at best they can but  utter  My whose sensitive faculties revolt when I hear of an imperious  kettle drummer  chaffering with such a man as Dr HAVESand out of the thousands received for admission to the festivalslike a huckster haggling for a few poundswhich at last perhaps may go to furnish out the revels of a guard room at the SAVOY The old women in this country say if any thing is amiss  "the king should know it"  If he  properly  knew thisso graciously benignant are his private virtues so much does he greatly pique himself on being much a MAN as well as a MONARCHthat I sincerely believe the words of the sailor would be verified and that somebody would chance to get a  salt eel  Arm yourself with patience I have dipped into music and you know when I begin I do not easily leave off To shew however that I am consistent there are other things I as closely stick toone of which is my continually assuring you that I am  Most sincerely Yours C DIBDIN  Sheffield    March    LETTER XLII  ON HARMONY  "  From harmonyfrom heavenly harmonythe universal frame began  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  LEAVING DONCASTER I went by invitation to WAKEFIELD where having some leisure I threw a few loose thoughts on paper concerning musicwhich can no where come so properly as in this letter  Philosophers truly say that even the minutest objects have place on the scale of universal harmony andspite of VOLTAIRE's PLATO's  Demiurgos  It is almost unnessary to say I allude to PLATO's dream on general good and evil which having related to his scholars and harrangued them for a considerable time on the subject of it till he and they are tiredone of them yawning cries out  "and so then I suppose  you awoke  "  nettles and toads are not without their use But it does not follow that men are to be continually peeping into the holes and corners of nature for objects that cannot possibly satisfy a single sensation but curiosity which even in its gratification will be accompanied with disgust These positions minutely hold good in relation to music Discords are said to be the soul of harmony whichif this declaration be admittedmust be according to POLONIUS very unlike  wit  discords being the very reverse of  brevity  So much indeed are they the limbs and outward flourishes that one would think they were introduced to  bewilder  what they ought to  elucidate  Yet fear not  ye mere harmonists but I shall allow that discords have their use but dare not to think of them otherwise than as the  spiders  and  hemloc  of music or that they are more material to the  soul of harmony  than those noxious objects to the universal  system of nature  Speaking to men of common sense I cannot be supposed to address myself to more than one out of twenty musicians Nor am I ashamed or afraid of making the declaration No man need be ashamed of telling the truth and for the fearthe whole twenty will respectively believe themselves alluded to by the above exception in which case I shall be thanked rather than blamed for where is the mana musician especiallywho will not chuckle at even an imaginary hit at his neighbour  To express myself less archly and probably more to the point What I am going to say relative to harmony shall or I have lost my aim apply to all men who have understandings be they musicians or not musicians and as it is a subject on which a great deal has been both said and done to very little purposeas it has opened as far as it goes as many doors to imposition as law or priestcraft and as been as conducive to picking of pockets as a seminary at St GILES'sI conceive it my duty at least to attempt a reform  If ever term had a positive implication the etymology of the word music isto  please  to  charm  to  delight  Mr HERON the critic if he felt what I do at this moment would sayI will spurn at common rules and changethe better to express myselfthis  substantive  music into a  verb  and conjugate it through all the moods and tenses It is true music may excite horror but then it is a mimic horror which has its delectable effects The  ear  is the door of the heartand I will venture to pronounce there is no  perfect  music but that which is  pleasing  The demonstration is clear nothing can be  perfect  that is  incomplete  Mere  harmony  is incomplete for it is a BODY to which  melody  is the SOUL  Ergomere harmony  is not  perfect music  The English from their natural goodness of heart take upon hearsay a man's abilities  "I am no judgeI can't say I heard any thing striking in such an airbut the man has great reputation and of course his music is goodthough I must confess it does not seem to me to be very pleasing"  Let this for ever decide upon such sort of judgment  If a man have a disposition to be pleased with musicthough he be totally ignorant of it as a scienceif he can point out what air has ever given him real pleasurewhich he must be qualified to do if he has heard the  Beggar's Opera  or  Comus  if such a man should listen with attention a first a second and a third time to an air and yet cannot feel a delight capable of the clearest explanationand heaven knows that may easily be now a daysthat music deserves to be burnt even though HANDEL were the composer This rule however is liable to some correction  Original  music will never strike at first equal to what it will upon repetition so that original composersand indeed so do writersrun the most risque Care therefore ought to be had to examine whether it is from the stile of the music the hearer cannot immediately decide The infallible way however is to hear the air repeatedlyand if at length it catch hold of the heart the trouble is well recompensed by the pleasure it will ever afterwards afford  By the same token let not the auditor form a  hasty  judgment A familiar air jigging upon the ear may be  pleasing  but it will most probably be  stolen  in which case it can be entitled only to an illegitimate reputation andlike a present imitation of GARRICKthough ever so perfect serve only to make us regret that the incomparable original  is no more  Any man with an ear and a heart made rather of more penetrable stuff than the gentleman at LINCOLN may venture to pronounce his opinion on MUSIC I do not however mean those carping cavilling critics who as it were take the dimensions of sounds and go about to explain their excellence  as methodically as they would to bore a cylinder or weigh air These have  ears  too but they are like that of DIONYSIUS  expanded  to discover  all the faults  Let not therefore any one be deterred from freely giving his sentiments after having consulted his heart Harmony is not intended to conceal the beauties of music but to round and perfect them and men may as well talk of a  picture  without an  outline  as  music  without  air  In short all the labyrinth of harmony may be mechanically explored but melody is that charm from which music receives animation which cannot be attained by the art of man but is an intuitive principle derived from nature I do not understand the text  "from harmony from heavenly harmony the universal frame began"  It could not be harmony till it was completed From a chaos of sounds men of brilliant fancy and good taste select a certain number and model them into form and orderfor it cannot be denied that a song is as perfectly understood with a single voice as accompanied by a band  Harmony  serves to  ornament  and  set off  the  melody  but cannot do more In short  melody  is the  naked figure  and  harmony  the  dress  which now adays is as fantastical and ridiculous as the clothes of men and womenand believe I need not say any thing stronger to prove that harmony should contain nothing but what is  neat convenient  and  graceful  which every body understands  Ergo  every body is musician enough to be a musical critic and thus the stupid nonsense of theorists ought for ever to be silencedbut there would be as much difficulty to do that as to prevent me from telling you how much I am  Yours C DIBDIN  Sheffield    March    LETTER XLIII  A RETURN TO PLACES AND CHARACTERS  "  If variety be a pleasure in life  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I shall drop a little the subject of music to tell you how I sped at WAKEFIELD and introduce to your notice such characters and incidents as are now ripe for your observation Among these let me first speak of one of the most intelligent cheerful pleasant men I have met with I mean Mr CLEMENTSHAW who is by every body admired and respected and whose conversationfor indeed it is very desireableis every where desired He is the organistwas a pupil of Dr MILLERhas all the neighbouring teachingand is in a very comfortable and reputable situation His performance on the harpsichord is second only to BOYTON nay when we consider that this happy easy manwhose face is never without a smile nor I believe his heart without a benevolent sensationis blindwhich I would not declare did I not know his perfect good sense and strong philosophyhe may in some respects be considered as BOYTON's equal No man's conversation is more agreeable for no man has a more perspicuous and decided judgment on all general subjects But his great forte is a rational laugh He shall make you more and better extemporary puns in an hourwith a view to  laugh at punning  than Mr O'KEEFE would studiously introduce in a whole  piece in expectation of  same  I will give a few instances  'Don't you think'  said one  'that is a  striking  argument'    "Why no"  answered he  "I dont think any  blows  past"  'Waiter'  said one  '  fill  that glass  full  '  "So"  said he  "shall he  fulfil  your request"  'This table is made of good wood'  says one  "Yes"  said he  "it is like the Yorkshireman going with his pig to market  ma hog an I  "  And then when we could not get the waiter near us  "Did you ever see"  said he  "such a set of  uncome for table  fellows"  And afterwardsbeing asked to drink winesaid he  "This is perfectly coasting"    'How coasting'  "Why we are already at  Port'smouth  and you are so determined to bring us to  Plymouth  that if we don't take care we shall be at  Failmouth  "  I would have him take care lest he should be sent for to make Operas for as he can  pun  and  compose  he might become a dangerous competitor to Messrs O'KEEFE and SHIELDS But I fancy they need not be uneasyhe has too much good sense to quit his agreeable situation and if he was either to write or compose for the public he would neither disgrace his  piece  by a  pun  nor his  music  by an  imitation  He has read every thing has a wonderfully retentive memory and separates and discriminates sentiments and opinions in an elegant taste and with modest and convincing arguments In short I know not any man in whose company I have felt more pleasure no wonder therefore I take so much in repeating it Mr SOUTHERN of WAKEFIELD who is a fine young man and much beloved is also entitled to my acknowledgements and the Rev Mr VINCENT will I hope pardon me if I take this opportunity of thanking him with great sincerity for the many kind services he did me Nor shall WALLER the printer that wellmeaning kind creature go without my hearty good wishes for I am sure I have his  I had one very good night at WAKEFIELDSaturday December thand after spending the Sunday most agreeably with CLEMENTSHAW went on the Monday to LEEDS On Tuesday I performed to a very decent number among which were some of the principal people who at the end of the entertainment begged I would give it again on the Thursday One gentleman in particular took a great deal of pains procured me the assembly room was in a great measure the cause of its being well filled and gave me a handsome letter to a gentleman at MANCHESTER  I must not pass by an incident which very strongly proves a positionnot a bad one by the byeof Mr ASTLEY the rider Says he  "your SHAKESPEARE there upon the stage says that all the world's a stageDamme I says says I all the world's a puppet shew Why now d'ye see ben't every body shewmen Don't the king good bless him shew his lions at the tower"  But to proceed There happened to be at LEEDS at the time I mention a full grown gentleman six and thirty inches high and about an hour before I began my performance an ambassador from the  little man  was dispatched to negociate with me the terms of an itinerant alliance I listened to the proposal with great coolness and asked if it was the wish of this man in miniature to be produced out of my pocket or exhibited on my finger while I should sing  "say little foolish fluttering thing"  At LEEDS I became acquainted with Mr WARBURTON an independant professional man who has it amply in his power to assist the amusement of the public without the necessity of submitting to humiliation His spirited and sensible conduct in a business that happened just before I came to LEEDS as above gives a striking proof of this I had heard at WAKEFIELD that it would be impolitic to apply to Mr WARBURTON for he was  out of favour  'How out of favour'  Why he had neglected to attend one of the concertsMy answer was that I supposed he was better engaged The fact however was thisMr WARBURTON was chosen by the managers of the concert as commander in chief for it would have been an affront to his situation in life to have considered him in any other light Notwithstanding this he was continually thwarted and though out of pocket by the concert expected to be at their beck and call upon all occasions This he overlooked with the contempt it meriteddetermined to go on as smoothly as he could till the end of the season but being ill  they  say through having drank too much the day before at a turtlefeasthe thought it could be no such great matter if they were for once to make a trial of spelling out the  concertos  and  sonatas  by themselves A resolution was immediately formedand immediately repented of  to admit Mr WARBURTON no more who on his part very properly determined to have nothing more to do with them What is the consequence It never would have given him any pleasure to have his ears tortured with the dissonance and false time of  gentlemen players  who after all he must not dare to commandfor they were in the situation of  Trinculo  in the  Tempest    "You shall be king and I'll be viceroy over you"  He must therefore secretly rejoice at being rid of a trouble which nothing but his own good natureof which no man possesses a larger shareever induced him to give himself and they repine at their nonsensical folly which has deprived them of the only means by which their concert could stand the smallest chance of flourishing or being respectable As to the business of the turtlefeast 'tis too illiberal to talk about it but admitting it were true it only proves that Mr WARBURTON cannot stand liquor quite so well as themselves I have so particularly mentioned this circumstance that it may serve as a hint to the  diletanti  in the country whoand they may take my word for itbecause they can  scrape  upon the  fiddle  out of tune  toot  a little upon the  flute  or  growl  upon the  violoncello  are neither qualified to command such men as Mr WARBURTON nor give the  ton  to the MUSICAL WORLD  My TOUR has already pretty well shewn that I have as much patience as any public man need but I declare were I in the affluent situation of Mr WARBURTON whichas he truly deservesmay he long comfortably enjoy I should content myself with the eligible and distinguished attention paid me by LORD MEXBOROUGH SIR GEORGE ARMYTAGE Mr FAWKES c and feel very little inclination indeed to be at the devotion of a set of  mechanics  who think themselves of prodigious consequence by having taken it into their heads to become  gentlemen fidlers  Among these God forbid I should have the ingratitude to rank any of those who attended me  LEEDS is a town of great trade so much so that a gentleman belonging to one of the banks assured me the whole returns of the place could not be  less than from five to seven millions a year This cannot be done but by men who have thrown  fortunes  into  trade  who as I have often experienced have nothing of the littleness that springs in low minds from  turning the penny  I desire also I may not be understood to say that there are not tradesmen who have heads and hearts that would do honour to the highest situations  Kings  may do  little  actions and  coblersgreat  ones I aim at nothing but to distinguish between meanness and generosity Those who possessand that largelythe latter quality are now among Mr WARBURTON's friends and I fancy any man upon the same terms will not feel uneasy at beingin the way he is  out of favour  Such favour is as indifferent to him as yours is material to  Dear Sir  Your obliged friend C DIBDIN  Sheffield    March    LETTER XLIV  MORE CROTCHETS  "  Nature's above art in this respect  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  HAVING in my last letter but one spoken generally of  harmony  and shewn that it is the mere  wood  and  stone  of MUSICwhich might as well have lain dormant as a part of the original chaos if  melody  did not lend it order symmetry and proportion I shall in this investigate it something more minutely and shew that what is called harmony is now  refined  into such a pitch of barbarismwhich though it may seem a paradox is literally truththat the ear would be better gratified by the grossest violation of the rules of composition as they are called than by such abstruse subdivisions of tones and resolutions of discords asaccording to  theorists  are the very essence of  harmony  Nor am I unable or unwilling to prove what I advance  Every rule of composition except avoiding consecutive fifths and octaves arein the hands of men of geniusto be violated with considerable advantage else the great HANDELthe masterly CORRELLIthe charming natural easy ARNEthe graceful GALUPPIand almost every body of real consequence must be excluded from among the adepts To these two standing rules however the boldest sons of nature have paid some respect and it is true that two  major fifths should never be consecutive Upon this I ground my argument Let any man play two sensecutive fifthswhich would be a musical sacrilegeand it shall sound more pleasing to an indifferent ear than the introduction of the chord of the thirteenth ever so well prepared and resolvedwhich is a  musical excellences  But who shall answer when I go further and say that the very harmonists themselves have only to play on a full organ and they will infallibly add to the charms of their own ingenious modulation all these complicate violations of harmonyfor the  diapason principle  and  sesqualtra  compounding the very distances which musicians are commanded to avoid the beauties and faults are blended together and how must the understanding be shocked by the admission of error into a system of perfection How then shall this be reconciled The organ is a noble instrument Some  poet  says it is calculated to inspire holy love The  musician  therefore cannot lay the fault on the  instrument  as the  devil  did upon the  water  because he could not swim This will be found to be the fact Let a simple unadorned melody be accompanied only by such modulations as arise from the general and perfect nature of the subject andnotwithstanding the violation of the rules in consequence of the complicate construction of the instrumentmy life for it the right effect upon the passions will be produced without which  harmony  is no longer  pleasing  and consequently no longer  music  One should think these dogmatic musicians knew their own defects and encouraged themlike callous hearted lawyers who dare not indulge the softer feelings lest they should incline them to pity and compassion I am told there is a certain great harmonist who wears the  hind  part of his shirt  before  by way of armour against CUPIDfearing lest any thing  tender  and  natural  should get into any of his compositions and as to Mr BAUMGARTEN who is at this moment supposed to be the best  theorist  in the kingdom he has so wonderfully  improved  upon fuguing that he never  leads  the band at  Covent Garden  theatre  but the instruments all  follow  Mr SHAW who leads the band at  Drury Lane  and who manifests more style and taste in the conducting of any one  overture  than Mr BAUMGARTEN ever did in his whole life has it seems put himself apprentice to this great man Thus in time we may have lively hopeswhen the bagpipe shall have done squeakingthat theatrical music like theatrical government shall be distinguished by its discords that a knowledge of thorough bass shall be the indispensible requisite in a comic singer that clowns and chambermaids will sputter out their nonsense in fugues and dying lovers warble their distress in counterpoint  Indeed were I to enumerate all the tricks of these profound theorists it would take up a larger portion of time and pains than I am willing to allow so unprofitable a subject As far however as it conduces to the point I wish to carry I shall in my free way go a little further regardless how they may feel so I but serve the public cause Some of theseand for a man of such admirable genius it is a pity justice obliges me to say one of them is HAYDNgive you an idea of a ropedancer who though you cannot too much admire how prettily he frisks and jumps about keeps you in a constant state of terror and anxiety for fear he should break his neck If this country had produced nine HOOKS and they had divided among them the manuscript of HAYDN's compositionsor indeed were to work upon them now they are published which is just as fair play as times gothere would be materials enough to furnish each a musical reputationand yet is there a fair wellwroughtup movement in his whole works Do they consist of any thing more than strong effusions of genius turned into frenzy and labouring as ineffectually to be heard as a flute in a belfry or equity in a court of justice In short pursue every thing that is cold unnatural complex and dry and it is the road to the altar of APOLLOif  discord  be the high priest But I rather thinklike the usurper who as he worshipped at the shrine of folly fondly thought he knelt in the temple of famethey will find imagination sensibility and expression are as necessary requisites to the accomplishment of a perfect musician as courage clemency and humanity are to make up the true renown of an hero In short teach a child to walk upon his hands that he may  be more expert with his feetlet him play with fire to endure the smart if he chance to be burntinstruct him in  algebra  to teach him  multiplication  or do ought but take the plain easy natural course of setting about any thing and you shall have an idea of the shallow miserable resources of these empty men to hide the sterility of their intellects which after all is like the goose that thrust its head in the hedge to conceal itselfforgetting that its body was exposed But if they are so reprehensible while they stick to straight forward thrumming as many notes at a time as they have fingerswhich they would if they had as many as BRIAREUSwhat shall we say when we go with them into chromatics Dr WAINWRIGHT is known to have rejected every thing natural maintaining that a  tone  by a man of ingenuity might be softened into as many shades as a  colour  Here is glorious ground work for the theorist Who knows but the full tone which is now only divided may one day or other be so subdivided as to form a  new  system of theoryin which case a man would find it as tedious to go from one end of the gamut to the other as it was formerly to take a journey from YORK to LONDON If it shouldthe utmost that can be said about it is that a learned musician like a greyhound jumps over hedges and ditches at the risk of his hidewhile the child of nature like a horse jogs on safely contenting himself with the turnpike road  "Nature ever was above art"  and will be ages after I have the powerfor so long shall I have the inclinationto subscribe myself  Yours With fervent sincerity C DIBDIN  Sheffield    March    LETTER XLV  SETTLING OF ACCOUNTS  "  Populous cities please me then  "  And the busy hum of men  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  MY account of places manners c is of a long standingtherefore I may as well give you time to digest my arguments concerning music and clear my ground as far as I have goneas gardeners dig in the old cabbage stalks to make the surface of the bed the fairer on which they are preparing to plant a new crop Indeed I have generally spoken of every place but I would willingly leave nothing undone To set about this completely I believe I must go back as far as BIRMIGNHAM the ingenuity and populousness of which place are wonderful The increase of buildings both for convenience and pleasure has extended the place to a space at least as large again as when I knew it twentyfive years ago The first however is as praise worthy as the last is ridiculous Not that I would not have men enjoy the money they have earnedlet it be procured through whatever medium it honestly maybut the country houses of the BIRMINGHAMITES are embellished to as little purpose as a chimneysweeper washes his face and as awkwardly as a Guineapig imitates a squirrel As to their manners I am sure they are not  good  ones A tenacious man must infallibly in BIRMINGHAM be affronted ten times a dayfor even if you go to  buy  any thing it is fifty to one if you receive a civil answerand this rudeness extends  to the most opulent among them A man who is said to possess two hundred thousand pounds used me with a style of incivility that would have disgraced a porter in Thamesstreet and I called upon another man of the first consequence there whom I could not single out from the journeymen blacksmiths that surrounded him Indeed master and servant is confounded among them for each leads the same life works as hard drinks as much fat ale and undergoes as much drudgery as the other nor do I see that one has more felicity in counting useless guineas than the other in carding buttons I really speak here without acrimony and it may be seen by this I had no better success at WOLVERHAMPTON than at BIRMINGHAM and yet there I found civility not incompatible with trade  I have been trying what to say more of LICHFIELD but can find nothingunless I were to go over the old ground of the massacre of DIOCLESIANin which a thousand christians were martyred and their bodies exposed to wild beasts For this cruel event it seems to have mourned ever since for it is so melancholy that one would wonder Miss SEWARD could write verses that have so many charms for the reviewers in a place apparently calculated to engender only the vapours but indeed those gentlemen in general seem to have a peculiar knack of speaking  eloquently  upon  dull subjects  I shall say nothing to the antiquity of DERBY but only mention it as a clean prettylooking genteel town where I sincerely believe the inhabitants want neither spirit nor taste As to what happened to me it was one of those strokesa  traverse  that have attended me all my life and which like the mistake of a figure in the solution of a mathematical problem in proportion as you expect to come home to your point carries you out of your way  NOTTINGHAM as I have before said has something charming in its situation the castle has a beautifully romantic effect and the  Trent  breaks the country near it in a most delightful and picturesque manner Indeed I know not at times whether the mind does not as strongly pant for objects that derive their grandeur from simplicity as for those surprising natural effects which as it were pain and giddy the senses till sober reality is lost in intoxicated imagination  NEWARK is something in the style of DERBY I do not think the inhabitants are so rich but they do not want spirit NEWARK is a very desirable place for persons of small fortune to settle at House rent is reasonable and the corporation being for the size of the place richpaving highways public building and repairs maintaining the poor and many other necessary but heavy charges are defrayed without assessing the inhabitants and yet they are better paid than in any other town of its standing that I have seen The  townhall  and the  poorhouse  are in  proportion  I believe I may venture to say the best in ENGLAND  If it be true that LINCOLN formerly contained fifty two parish churches and one thousand and seventy one houses of entertainment it is certainly very much fallen into decay The situation from the hill is wonderful and the clergy who are astonishingly numerous there seem to have got on as high a  pinnacle  as they can with a view I hope to evince how idle to them are all the vain pomp and glory of this world I am not honoured with the knowledge of these gentlemen nor had I the least conversation with any except Dr KAYE who though a certain newspaper is extremely angry that he should be praised at the expence of the rest of the clergy has in the opinion of many others as well as myself set an example in the business of the  tithe child  that we shall stand very little chance of seeing imitated The manners of LINCOLN seem to be a constant internal enmity and a remarkable shyness to strangers Their musical taste I have given an instance of  HULL originally a small fishing village is now a very considerable sea port and lying between YARMOUTH and NEWCASTLE is remarkably convenient either for homeward or outward bound ships The increase of their commerce is apparent in the new dock already made and that lately applied for to parliament Round the dock is formed a kind of crescent consisting of magnificent houses which form an appearance of extraordinary novelty by being the boundary of one of the dirtiest places in the kingdom On the opposite side of the dock is a row of warehouses to a prodigious extent very spacious and admirably well stored As to their taste I do not think they relished much of my entertainment except  Grog  and for their mannersbeing all seamenthey are blunt honest and careless I must not forget to mention the kind attention of Mr MARLEY whom I should have been happy to have know better that I might have spoken of his professional merit with the same certainty as that of BOYTON and CLEMENTSHAW It is universally allowed to be very brilliant and I am sure if it bear any proportion to his kind and obliging private conduct his friendswho are a very large numbercannot speak too highly of it Nor will I neglect to record the kindness of poor HUDSONhow no morewho died like the wife of BONIFACEbut in this life we have need of CORDIALSso peace to him  Poor HUDSON puts me in mind of a brotherinlaw of GRIFFIN the bookseller who was killing himself by drinking A friend of his as he was creeping along one day asked him how he did  'Very bad indeed'  anwered he  "I am sorry for it"  said the friend  "what do you take"    'Every thing'  said the sick man  '  hot brandy  and  cold brandyhot gin  and  cold gin  but none of it does me any good  As this subject is rather dry I shall now speak alternately of music and places till I have fairly brought up my account as far as my second visit to LEEDSafter which I shall open a new field and expatiate largely on a variety of public subjects Adieu  Yours Most sincerely C DIBDIN  London    March    LETTER XLVI  A MUSICAL ALARM  "  The adventure of the bear and fiddle  "  Is sungbut broke off in the middle  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  THEORY in music and the empty nonsense of its professors being the subject of my last letterin which I think I have plainly shewn that a single air with simplicity for its object and expression for its effect is infinitely preferable to the most laboured production that can be worked up mechanicallyI shall proceed to remark on the pernicious effects of following a doctrine so very false and delusive and point out that it has step by step perverted and vitiated the English taste First of all  theorists  content themselvesindeed they want invention to do otherwisewith very indifferent and in general  trite  melodies Thus having acquired great reputation by the pomp annexed to their being professed musicians their music is listened to and at length liked upon the principle of a man's eating biscuit at sea because he can get no bread The human mind is so prone to the reception of pleasure that it very often takes it upon credit and is swindled into a belief of the reality of what upon examination turns out to be only counterfeit Thus the manly and I will venture to say correct taste of the English which admired the works of PURCELL ARNE and BOYCEand surely they have among them some of the sweetest melodies that ever spoke  to the heartis now dwindled into an admiration of the grossest insipidity It should seem as if music had expired with the singers who uttered it and that LEVERIDGE and BEARD  I do not mean to say BEARD is literally no moreI am informed he possesses at this moment all his faculties in full vigour may he long do so I was very young when Mr BEARD knew me and he must remember through the ersuasion of others he treated me very unhandsomely but I acquit him of all intention to do so and take this public opportunity of assuring him that I never had of any man a higher opinion nor for any a greater value  having given way to the use of effeminacy and falcetto the style should sink in proportion otherwise how can it be accounted for that the  "Hark forwards"  of the present day should be ten times more in circulation than  "With horns and with hounds"  or  "The early horn"  Has not a single insipid song called the  Mansion of peace  brought six times the profit to the composer that the whole  Chaplet  did to BOYCEthough to mention the comparative merits would be like talking of a Scotch bank note and the riches of the treasury Nothing in nature can be more beautifully delicious than  "Vain is every fond endeavour"  and  "What med'cine can soften the bosom's keen smart"  Pshaw what are these trifles says a theorist to a  fugue  To which I answera great deal for they can make only the  fugue  whereas Dr BOYCE could make BOTH But to enumerate other instances Is it not true that at this moment were the beauties of ARNE collected together headed by all the melody sweetness spirit character and expression in  Comus  the charming peculiarly natural airs to which he so enchantingly set the Songs of SHAKESPEARwhich task I will venture to say no man in the world could have executed equal to ARNEand made up of those innumerable charms which pervade his voluminous works would they not be all neglected for that miserable unmeaning imitation of  La virginella  and twenty other thingscalled  Ma cher ami  And to give yet a stronger proof Were all PURCELL's duettos brought forthwho had beyond all question a more vigorous mind than HANDELwere  "Let CESAR and URANIA live"    "To arms"    "As I saw fair CLORA"  and in short all those admirable compositions which so honourably mark the  strength of English genius  CORELLI is said to have visited ENGLAND on purpose to see PURCELL but hearing at ROCHESTER of his death he did not even visit the CAPITAL but returned saying  "There can be nothing worthy my curiosity since PURCELL is dead"  would they not be despised for that most execrable of all apologies for MUSIC the  Duetto  sung by Mr KELLY and Mrs CROUCH  I beg I may not be understood to mean by what I have here advanced that the compilers of such contemptible stuff are the  theorists  of whom I have spoken above These are only the dabblers who take advantage of the bad taste of the times But to come more closely to the point and satisfy every enquirer what are the steps which have caused this gradual declension in the public taste I answer in great measure a blind predilection for the works of HANDEL and an indiscriminate avidity for German compositions What shall any man dare to make so bold a declaration I dobut let me have fair play HANDEL was a composer of wonderful abilities his conception was strong his imagination immense his knowledge of music as a science clear and profoundand those masterly combinations of sounds which make up many of his chorusses abundantly prove it but like hounds led on by the huntsman on a false scent he is admired in ENGLAND for his very errors  HANDEL has been frequently compared to SHAKESPEARE though nothing can be upon more opposite grounds than the admiration which has been respectively paid them SHAKESPEARE has been always praised for his genius and HANDEL for his judgment He who wished so much of the writings of SHAKESPEARE obliterated would I fancy have been at a loss where to have laid his finger whereas it were very easy to point out which half of HANDEL's works might be consigned to oblivion and yet leave all that is pleasing in his compositions behind  When I say errors I do not speak as to his knowledge as a musician but to his taste as a man of genius These errors in HANDEL relate to expression which was sometimes false like tinsel in poetry sometimes ridiculous like bombast often begun upon a principle which sunk in the end to  absurditymaking exactly the bathos and very frequently indeed sound without either meaning or expression answering exactly to nonsense verses  I believe it will be allowed me that the parts of any thing which offers itself to human observation are complete only as they regard the whole In music no man ever did or will greatly succeed who takes up  particular  instead of  general  expression HANDEL was a slave to thisbut to adduce my proofs  His false expression was this If the subject happened to be joy he toO frequently invetend something  sprightly  without considering  time place  or  occasion  as  "Rejoice oh daughter of SION"  which surely should convey a holy joy expressive of religious soulfelt rapture instead of which this song was first a  jig  and afterwards a  hornpipe  Another instance occurs in  Judas Maccabeus  in the song  "Let honour with desert be crown'd"  The word trumpet here happening to be introduced he has taken such an  advantage  of it that the whole song seems as if it was set to display the effect of the trumpet in a key which does not belong to it and where of course it has the  worst effect  that can be imagined and as if this was not enough the words seem to be written as a burlesque on the music for they run thus  "The trumpet ne'er in vain should sound"  I have heard this song praised as the best in all his works  The second instance which I call ridiculous or bombast is a worse fault than the otherand yet it occurs as frequently Who can listen to such a pantomime tune as  "The land brought forth frogs"  and call it any thing but burlesqueand yet this is a popular favourite I heard a man in the gallery say while the chorus was performing which begins  "And he spake the word and there came all manner of flies and lice in all their quarters"  that he itched from head to foot Would the gentleman have been obliged to HANDEL for giving him this sensation if he had lived in the days of JAMES I who is said to have prohibited scratching  "THAIS led the way"  and  "The king seized a flambeau"  are again of this complexionfor they both convey a kind of drunken gaiety and give you more the idea of their going up stairs to bed together than to set the Persepolis on fire  As to the bathos it occurs in such instances as the chorus in the  Messiah  beginning  "All we like sheep are gone astray"  which profanes the words it should express and might with great propriety be put into the  "Peep behind the curtain"  where the story of ORPHEUS is burlesqued The sheep certainly dance and frisk about very curiously and run away from each other but unfortunately conceiving himself under a musical necessity of making a close in the line  "We have turned every one to his  own way  "  he brings them all back and they finish by huddling lovingly together Query whether so great a man as HANDEL might not with impunity have invented some new species of inverted counterpoint that might have finished the chorus with their all baaing to one another at a distance But I am getting into length and therefore shall in imitation of HUDIBRAS break of in the middle I will resume the subject however after the next letter till when and at all times I am  Most faithfully Yours C DIBDIN  London    March    LETTER XLVII  A FURTHER SETTLEMENT  "  Over steeples towers and turrets  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  BEVERLEY is said to be one of the prettiest towns in ENGLAND To this I cannot wholly agree It is a snug decent town has a spacious market place and its minsterwhich is very ancient and was formerly a sanctuary to bankrupts and criminalsis yet a very handsome church but I think it inferior to many towns in Yorkshire as to beauty consequence or situation The inhabitants however appear to be independent and by mixing socially together promote very pleasantly all that is necessary or agreeable towards forming a friendly and comfortable neighbourhood This town has many advantageous privileges among which is their being exempt from toll and custom  I know not what to say of YORK except that it fell infinitely below my expectations in every point of view I expected to see a large oppulent populous placesecond to nothing in ENGLAND but LONDONinstead of which except the  church  and the  gaol  there is no one object that conveys an idea of superiority to the other towns around it It is not near so populous as LEEDS nor half so much frequented Talking to a gentleman at LEEDS I told him YORK put me in mind of a man in conversation  who though rich in volubility finished as he beganhaving impressed no one with either truth or reason in his argument whereas LEEDS put in only a word now and then but always to the purpose YORK is  in proportion  the poorest place in the whole county of which it is the capital Its situation being in the very center of all the great north roads which are now very fine and astonishingly frequented it is continually  busy  without having  any thing to do  and though constantly  crammed  thinly  inhabited  The inns alone seem to thrive there In short it has many churches and but little  devotion fine clothes  and  spare purses  a  magnificent prison  always  full  and a  theatre royal  where they perform  at a constant loss  As a proof of their musical taste they think Mr KELLY and Mrs CROUCH's  duetto  comprizes all the excellence of all the masters that ever bowed at the shrine of APOLLO It must be remembered I have one exception to these general rulesand I believe when I say I have  but one  I write as strong a satire as words are capable of conveying  MALTON is a shabby town apparently in every respectI will therefore leave it and go on to SCARBOROUGH which is one of the prettiest seaports I have seen Every body knows it is maintained upon the principle of BATH One thing however surprized me though I was cautioned against the unreasonableness of their charges I found them so much the reverse that I paid less for better things than at any place on that side the HUMBER  WAKEFIELD I confess is one of my favourite places There is such a sprightly cleanliness about it that the inhabitants seem as if they were born for the real purposes of life The village of HEATH near it is one of the sweetest spots for neatness and simplicity that imagination can form The vicinity of WAKEFIELD is filled with opulent and respectable inhabitants all of whom inherit or have accumulated fortunes by trade Their manners appear to be simple and unaffected their conversation is polished and in their musical pursuits they go my way to work and praise every thing that pleases them upon reflection  DONCASTER has all the neatness of a quaker and on a first view begets very strongly your sober admiration but when you come to consider that they have no soul no taste no characteristic but insipidityafter having admired the  church  the  mansion house  and the  guildhall  you wish yourself any where but at DONCASTER  As to the roads to all those different places there are now no bad ones but what are necessarily so through situation and soil and near manufacturing towns where time can be more valuably employed than in mending roadsthough one would think that work would contribute to their convenience since the goods must be  carried  after they are  made  Thus almost every where in  swampy  LINCOLNSHIRE the roads are generally very disagreeable especially in winter and great part of DERBYSHIRE on account of the hills render your journeys unpleasant and not always very safe I must not forget in particular to mention that the nine miles from WAKEFIELD to LEEDS is so scandalously neglected that even in a postchaise and in the middle of the day you expect every moment to be overturned  Having now spoken of all those places to which I shall not find it necessary to return except perhaps for some general observations I shall go on from LEEDS to HALIFAX where I was advised to perform a night or two previous to my touching at MANCHESTER When I came there however they had a company of players and were otherwise so full of amusements that after sitting down a few days and writing a part of this TOUR I went on to MANCHESTERpromising if I could make it convenient to call on my return  On my arrival at MANCHESTER I not only found that the theatre was open but that Mr ASTLEY was figuring away in great style with his  horsemanship  to which amusement I have the same aversionand perhaps for better reasonsthat some men have to a CAT I therefore enclosed a letter  I had brought with me to an opulent gentlemaninformed him I would take another opportunity to pay him my personal respectsand posted away to LIVERPOOL  As my success at this place and the subjects on which it must necessarily induce me to speak will make a most essential and interesting part of this work I shall introduce them as conspicuously as possible in the following letter but one and in the interim supply the next with the remainder of my argument respecting HANDEL and German music which ideas I threw loosely on paper at HALIFAX which is said to be the most musical spot for its size in the kingdomfor there Mrs BATES received her musical educationthere Mr BATES has so planted a veneration for the works of HANDEL that children lisp  "For unto us a child is born"  and clothmakers as they sweat under their loads in the clothhall roar out  "For his yoke is easy and his burden is light"  I have been assured for a fact that more than one man in HALIFAX can take any part in the chorusses of the  Messiah  and go regularly through the whole oratorio by heart and indeed the facility with which the common people join together throughout the greatest part of YORKSHIRE and LANCASHIRE in every species of choral music is truly astonishing  This kind of cursory work is like posting the daybook into the ledger by and by we shall take out the different articles and come to a general account  Adieu  Yours Most sincerely C DIBDIN  London    March    LETTER XLVIII  ANOTHER TOUCH AT MUSIC  "  Strange so much difference should be  "  'Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  THE instances of HANDEL's total neglect of expression occur much more frequently than any of his other faults How many of his oratorio songs consist of a complex accompanimentingeniously worked up indeed but without the smallest relation to the subject of the wordswhile the voice drawls out an unmeaning train of sounds destitute of melody or any power of conveying a pleasing sensation Sometimes in these songs that the voice may have no reason to complain of having less to do than the instrumentsfor in this species of music every thing is upon a footingit floats away upon a long division and often such a one as no voice upon earth can execute This is surely the very reverse of what  vocal music  ought to be where every thing manifestly should be subordinate to the  voice  and even in a hautboy song or any other where a particular instrument may have an  obligato  accompaniment the voice ought to be every where  assisted  but no where  eclipsed  Vocal MUSIC is clearly the essence of whatever can render sound delectable that which is simplest and most expressive is the best vocal MUSIC and I will add that a song perfect in all its qualities is the utmost height of  excellence to which MUSIC can arrive This position I shall hereafter more fully go into as I mean to leave what I advance on this subject unanswerable  In solo songswhere one point of expression should be observed where a single unembarrassed subject should be well  begun followed  and  finished  HANDEL very often falls below mediocrity This proves that he is a better  instrumental  than a  vocal  composer for in the major part of his chorusses where the expression need not so much depend on the voicefor there it acts only as a kind of instrument to fill the partshe is much more happy and in his other works where the voice has no share at all he is incomparably greater than any where Who can deny this when they recollect the minuet in Ariadne There is not a superfluous note in it and being made up of one simple and yet grand objectregularly pursued and greatly worked upnothing in MUSIC for what it is can exceed it To which if you call in the other minuets together with the marches and gavottes which make up the last movements of his overtures the balance will be considerably in favour of my argument And yet while we whistle all these with the greatest facility without considering to whom we owe this satisfaction we get crowded at the abbeyto the tune of  two guineas  to be  stunned  with the  abstrusest  of his works which if the heart has any thing to do with MUSIC is the  worst  To prove this let me ask any man in his senses not a mere  theorist  if he ever felt so much real pleasure in hearing  "The horse and his rider"  as in the last movement of his famous coronation anthem of  "God save the king"  where there is scarcely a discord that might not be admitted without wounding simplicity into the most familiar song After a tedious and tiresome reiteration of discords placed unnecessarily in every point of view how are we charmed in the  Messiah  with  "For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth"  Why Because it is full of grandeur and simplicity The soul is struck with the sublime greatness and beauty of the expression and we feel the DEITY  in our hearts  Thus I think I have proved my position without injuring the reputation of HANDEL He his certainly left behind him some wonderful MUSIC but it cannot be denied that this  ore  is plentifully surrounded with  dross  Let us thereforewhich would be infinitely more to his honourtake his MUSIC upon credit of our own feelings and not blindly and implicitly from those who living in a labyrinth wonder how any one should prefer a direct road  As to the other  Germans  as they have no  opera  so they import no vocal MUSIC and thus by torturing sounds into new positions to make old ideas wear a novel shape  difficulty  is the only characteristic of their compositions and by this means the ear gets accustomed  not  to what  pleases  in MUSIC but to what  surprizes  I will venture to say  solos  and  solo concertos  have done but little good to the cause of MUSIC LA MOTTE's great merit was to figure away in  alt  till at last approaching to the bridge he played himself as it were out of sight The  dexterity  was  wonderful  but for heaven's sake where was the  pleasure  This is a solid factand to prove it let me ask how came GIARDINI and BARTHELEMON constantly to call in  Lango Lee The Dargle  c to help out their concertos  The human mind cannot pay proper attention but to one object at a time ZOFFANI's admirable portrait of the gallery of FLORENCEat which one might look a month and not discover half the beautiesthough it contains more grand objects than any twenty pictures that ever were painted has the meanest  tout ensemble  that can be imagined It is a chaos of exquisitely charming objects which cannot be properly distinguished because one confounds the effect of the other There is a soberness in real pleasure that cannot bear the impertinence of tickling and teazing In architecture it is the same Mr WOODFALL may remember as he and I were near each other in HENRY  the seventh's  chapel to see the ceremony of installing the knights of the Bath he took notice of the wonderful  labour  that had been bestowed  in ornamenting that place that there was such a variety and the parts were so minute that the eye was at a loss where to fix I said if this was the case he must confess it was  labour in vain  and the observation holds good in every thing that appeals to the senses And as to MUSIC if a man invent a tolerable melody and prevent its effect by complex accompaniment he will have no better success than the Irish painter who undertaking the portrait of a gentleman going a shooting hid the figure behind a large tree for fear he should frighten the partridges  I understand there has been already much curiosity concerning what I can possibly mean in my proposal by an exposition of  musical quackery  by the time the crotchetmongers shall have read this letter they may perhaps smell out what I am diving at I have yet however spoken only of impositions on the senses I mean hereafter to mention under the article of teaching something concerning designs on the pocket I shall first however place the different merits of dead composers side by side in which task I have no doubt but I shall prove to the satisfaction of every reasonable man that had not ARNE all his life been discouraged and HANDEL considered as another APOLLO the fame of the ENGLISHMAN would have exceeded that of the GERMAN This will nearly involve all that it will be necessary for me to sayand without mentioning a single name throw the merit or the want of it if you will of many living composers into that point of view in which it is but common justice to have it seen Then as the business of teaching is a serious evil I shall lay it open as bare as possible and give a receipt to heal the wound after which if the public chuse to be gulled with it no teaching tickets ought to pass between masters and scholars without a stamp that thus  musical quacks  may be at once upon the footing of  physical  ones Strange says SWIFT so much difference should be 'twixt tweedledum and tweedledee The world is more imposed on by trifles than is generally imagined It is a trifle to be surebut however no impositionto say I am truly yours  C DIBDIN  London    March    LETTER XLIX  A TRAIT OF ENGLISH OPULENCE  "  No foreign faction shall we need to rue  "  If England to herself do prove but true  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  TO LIVERPOOL I went without the smallest recommendation except indeed a letter to Mr PYE who keeps a music warehouse there and to whose attention and indefatigable pains to oblige and accommodate me I confess myself greatly indebted The difficulty I had to get at the  Mayor  and the doubtful reception I at first met with had at one moment nearly worked me up to a resolution of returning from thence as I went On my first performance however which was attended by about thirtyfive people and greatly relished several gentlemen made strenuous application to me to repeat it and proposed a better room for the purpose The next evening I had a very handsome audience on the third a better still and on the fourththough it was christmas eve and a concert nightI had the very best room I have experienced at any place since I first began my rambles Having done very handsomely at LIVERPOOL in relation to my entertainment and mustered so many more names to my subscription than at any other place except LONDON it may be suspected by the uncandid that I am induced on this account alone to speak well of that truly spirited place Those however who think liberally and who by the way are of the only description I care threepence about obliging will seeas I have every where  been justthat I give to LIVERPOOL as I do to BIRMINGHAM only its due  Throughout life it holds good as an infallible maxim that the mind will be influenced by its employment  Able financiers  have seldom in any country been  great ministers  because their measures have been constantly clogged by the cold regularity of mere calculation Retired tradesmen live still in the misery of fearing to spend a superfluous penny but merchants though expert at every qualification for the accumulation of profit are in their minds like their traffic extensive and expanded It is astonishing to witness the difference between a  counting house  and a  counter  For my part I look upon merchants to be the first of characters and an English one to be the first of merchants VOLTAIRE having drawn a paralleled view of different distinctions among men after mentioning the good sense of the English in intermarrying their nobility with commercial characters goes on and says  "After all it were worth while to consider which is the more truly noble he who knows to a moment when the king rises or goes to sleep orsomething elseor he who trades to every part of the globe thereby contributing to the comfort and convenience of human nature"  Nothing shews an object so well as a contrast therefore as I am not yet come to MANCHESTER and NEWCASTLE where at one place they measure  serret  by the  yard  and at the other  coals  by the  bushel  I cannot to my satisfaction dwell on LIVERPOOL On my return to that place I shall be more competent to display that openhearted liberality which in so short a time I might only have  imagined  they possess But my observation cannot but be well founded as they have less of hypocrisy than any set of people I ever met with in my life  A compact with any part of the public is with me a very serious thing thereforethough I was offered very handsomely to stayI left LIVERPOOL  and returned to HALIFAXwhere my advertisements stood for Thursday the twentyseventh  On christmasday therefore I left LIVERPOOL for MANCHESTER and the following dayafter being nearly lost in the snow near ROCHDALEarrived at HALIFAX I think it would be doing injustice to so well known a character if I were to omit mentioning that in the diligence from LIVERPOOL to MANCHESTER I was accompanied by Mr ASTLEY who at that time was returning from LIVERPOOL after having taken the town From eight o'clock in the morning till five in the afternoonfor so long is that diligence crawling thirtysix milesI am sure he did not cease I will not say  talking  but BAWLING for this gentleman being eternally on his hobbyhorse always fancies he is holding conversation with Mr MERRYMAN In the course of this curious rant he was so kind as to oblige me with his idea of improving the theatres the courts the parliament and the nation He wished he had known what I was about he would have given me such hints for my entertainment In short if I would but have listened to him I should have had new rules for making music writing singing playing and speaking English  "But"  hallowed he  "there is no talking to any of you Now there about lawLORD THURLOW told me in my riding housebut that's no matter There now you see there's that there PALMER if I had a mind I would have shewed him a trick that would have laid them all flat on their backs For you

you see what I am about now I thinks our licences will carry us throughbut if they should not you knowI am at a heavy chargeso you see I goes about and gets the profit of a season  before the season comes"  And good generalship it has turned out for I am credibly informedat BIRMINGHAM MANCHESTER and LIVERPOOLhe cleared nearly two thousand pounds  While I was at LIVERPOOL the business or the  slave trade  began to be agitated and out of curiosity I learned some particulars concerning it These however I shall defer till I mention what I gathered afterwards on that subject at MANCHESTER and add the rejoinder of the people of LIVERPOOL on my second visit to that place  Whether any thing be done in this important business or not the national character of the English will derive an additional lustre from the humane endeavours that have been exerted to annihilate a traffic which those who have petitioned against it think cruel and oppressive Perhaps an investigation of the abuses under the line may lead to an exposition and an amendment of those at home If so MANCHESTER will have unwittingly begun a reform of more magnitude than they were aware of and become the fortuitous perfecter of a constitution which wants only to be purged of  humours  contracted by  too much health  which performed it cannot be rendered more pure than the sincerity with which I profess myself  Yours C DIBDIN  London    March    LETTER L  THE HARMONY OF HALIFAX AND THE SINCERITY OF SHEFFIELD  "  Promising's one thingperforming another  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  IT is my business at present to speak of my success at HALIFAX and my return from thence to SHEFFIELD which MOUNTAIN for I love to use  hackneyed  expressions to  mediocre  subjects notwithstanding LORD CHESTERFIELD to his son reprobates them as vulgar that he may keep them to himself I suppose for nobody has more brought forth  A MOUSE  But first for HALIFAX  I had two nights at this place and considering the inhabitants of the  neighbourhood  for this black dismal town has  in it  very few people of any consequencewere locked up in their houses by the frost and snow they turned out decent but that was all My audience and indeed all HALIFAX and its environs men women and children being musical and as some think squall in tunejust as the negroes swimas soon as they are born my performance was  critically  attended to but I am afraid not much liked  MANZOLI and GUARDUCCI were competitors in ITALY the public were to determine which sung bestMANZOLI had the voice of the  spectators  and GUARDUCCI of the  musicians  what was the consequence MANZOLI made a fortune and GUARDUCCI did nothing  I am however not very sorry this circumstance occurred for it gives me  an opportunity which will be more strongly confirmed when I get to MANCHESTER of noticing that the  conoscenti  ever receive the least pleasure and in fact are the least infallible I sincerely believe however having paused on the second night and considered whether it was right to be pleased or not they would have attended with more satisfaction a thirdWhile they were deliberating however I was gone for having received a letter from Mr GALES who was so kind to make the necessary enquiries concerning the entertainment I got away to SHEFFIELD on Monday December the thirtyfirst  Of Mr GALES I scarcely know how to speak He is the printer of this work if therefore I should use slight language it will look like a compact between us  GARRICK and LACY had this compact between themwhatever one praised the other abusedWhen I made my article for seven years immediately after the  Jubilee  GARRICK was for giving me a  carte blanche  and LACY for beating me down in every thingThey so well carried their point by thisGARRICK having previously promised me that whatever I consented to through LACY's whims he would through his own generosity amply make up to methat I agreed to receive seven pounds a week for what was worth more than double that sum LACY having always had a regard for me I could not help a few days afterwards telling him that he had been very hard on me in the business of the agreement  "What the devil would you have"  said he  "'twas DAVID's doingshe prompted me"  and if I am lavish in my praises of him some may be apt to quote from SHAKESPEARE and say  "a little flattery sometimes does well"  I should therefore feel myself awkwardly situated but for one circumstance which has  major  MINOR and CONCLUSION in its favour as  clearly  as any problem in EUCLID  Before  I ever saw Mr GALES I had received numberless civilities at the hands of different  printers  from many of whom I have had offers to print my TOUR  after  I knew Mr GALES I preferred him to all the printers I had seen Thus I am enabled by a selfevident circumstance to express my sentiments as strongly as by trying my hand at a studied panegyrick which had I done in the sort of style my wishes led me to I should have been obliged to have enjoined Mr GALES's foreman  to have printed it unknown to his master for so diffident is he of his own worth that I should never have prevailed on him to let that issue from the press which would have been as great a credit to the public as any thing that ever did or ever will pass through it Another circumstance will by and by oblige me to speak in Mr GALES's favour in spite of his teeth Among my general subjects it will be very proper to take up newspapers in which case it would be very  improper  not to mention the  Sheffield Register  with that degree of praise it deserves  My  first  night at SHEFFIELD notwithstanding I had beat about almost expressly for ten weeks with a view of properly paying them a visit was a very bad one and feeling myself a little let down I should not have announced a second but for the persuasion of two or three gentlemen and the conditions I made were that my continuing the performance for any length of time at SHEFFIELD should depend wholly on the degree of success on the second evening which turning out but very little better than the first I gave the matter upnor could any persuasions induce me to resume it I can scarcely account for that strange kind of caprice through which people take so much pains to manifest the instability of their minds Nothing could be warmer than the apparent heartiness with which I was entreated to return to SHEFFIELD nor any thing cooler than my reception when I did return My welcome to a stranger would have seemed as if I had been sent away with contumely and they had wondered at my impudence at intruding myself among them a second time I looked down upon it as I can doheaven be praisedwhen I ought with a calm and tranquil mixture of pity and indifference and though not one of all the number who testified such satisfaction at my  first  visit came near me on my  second  I contented myself with a reflection that as it is the lot of mankind to be fickle and this worthy quality is generally influenced by local prejudice it must have arisen as the French say from  L'air du pais  and I have only to consider that the  iron  which was  hot  when I first went there had  cooled  in my absence  To shew however that I have a pleasure in being just I here publicly thank the inhabitants of SHEFFIELD for bringing me back even with all this obloquy for through it I acquired the friendship of Mr GALES and the satisfaction of employing him to print this work  Adieu  Yours Most sincerely C DIBDIN  London    March    LETTER LI  ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT  "  One woe doth tread upon another's heel  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  MY labourinvain expedition to SHEFFIELD hav+ing trifled away that whole week a nonsensical business started up which lost me the next From the little town of ROTHERHAM a proposal was sent me which to this moment I can scarcely make head or tail of My intention was to have performed at MANCHESTER on the Tuesday I however received a message that it would be a profit to me and a pleasure to the people of ROTHERHAM if I would give them a night there and that LADY EFFINGHAM had expressed a wish to that effect The inhabitants of that place after putting me to some expence and making me lose my time chose however to affect a perfect indifference about the matter and no night took place  The following letter which I wrote to clear myself from any suspicion of disrespect to LADY EFFINGHAM who suffered me to say in the bills that the entertainment was at her particular desire will elucidate this curious business a little better  To the Right Hon the COUNTESS OF EFFINGHAM  MADAM  I scarcely know in what words to apologize to your LADYSHIP for making so ill a return to your condescension as to disappoint you of my performance at ROTHERHAM The actual reason however which I shall briefly state will infallibly exculpate me from any intention of abusing the very generous and handsome liberality with which you did me the honour to permit the use of your name which circumstance had I not been precluded from circulating it must have procured me an ample attendance  A proposal through Mr WEBB of SHEFFIELD came to me from YOUR LADYSHIP and Mr WALKER and Mr WEBB went so far as to ask what sum would satisfy me for my trouble of going to ROTHERHAM My answeras it has constantly been whenever I hear of liberal names and liberal intentionswas that I was certainly safe in relying on whatever the gentlemen of ROTHERHAM influenced by your LADYSHIP and Mr WALKER might think proper to do and as I am very tenacious of not being considered merely as a common exhibitermy entertainment having been fabricated solely with a view to testify my gratitude to a generous public previous to my embarkment for INDIAI told Mr WEBB that if the night failed there would be abundant opportunity of making me amends without any extrapecuniary gratification by promoting the subscription of my MUSICAL TOUR Mr WEBB undertook to procure me an answer by  noon  on Sunday and I promised not to go so soon to MANCHESTER On Sunday night however hearing nothing of Mr WEBB I wrote to him and received a verbal answer that I must wait on Dr WAINWRIGHT Determined to know something more of this business I called at Doctor WAINWRIGHT's in the morning I saw only Mrs WAINWRIGHT who corroborated all that Mr WEBB had told me adding that the Doctor had commissioned Mr WEBB to treat with me that he would be on that day at  ROTHERHAM that there would be a meeting of the gentlemen and her advice was that I should immediately go there This I fully intended had I not by accident seen your LADYSHIP This circumstance determined me to stay at SHEFFIELD and solicit your name to my bill which request you did me the honour so handsomely to grant In the interim however I wrote to Dr WAINWRIGHT and sent some general bills for circulation but Dr WAINWRIGHT having left ROTHERHAM before the arrival of my letter it was referred to the gentlemen at the meeting and they agreed to write me word that they were ALL ENGAGED on Tuesday evening and could not attend me This letter not being given to the man till past nine o'clock in the evening he did not return to SHEFFIELD till yesterday morning  after  I had set out to ROTHERHAM prepared for the performance  On my arrival there the woman at the postoffice informed me that Mr WALKER had written me a letter and if I had not received it Mr TUCKER would tell me its contents I waited on Mr TUCKER who blamed me for not giving more notice and letting the gentlemen know  my  intention sooner I represented that I had but one intention about itwhich was  not  to go to ROTHERHAM had I not been strongly solicitedbut that hearing your LADYSHIP's name and Mr WALKER's so repeatedly mentioned I had been induced to comply with what was extremely inconvenient to me Mr TUCKER informed me that if I performed nobody could be therebut to comfort me that gentleman was so good as to say that even if he did not come himself he would send his half crown I smiled at the compliment but could not help so far feeling for myself as to say that half a crown was probably no more an object to me than to him He advised me at all adventures to see Mr WALKER for whom I immediately sought but finding he was gone to SHEFFIELD I saw I had nothing for it but to wait on your LADYSHIP make my apology and inform you honestly of what had happenedbut on coming to the inn I found that in my absence the landlord had put the horses which drew me to ROTHERHAM to Mr WALKER's carriage  Thus prevented every way from paying your LADYSHIP that deference and respect which are not more your due from your high and distinguished situation than from your affability and condescending benevolence I have nothing to resort to but this letter which will I doubt not sufficiently convince you that I have in no respect been to blame but on the contraryas this transaction has put me to some expence and prevented my receiving advantage elsewhereI have a right to consider it as as a piece of very unhandsome treatment which I feel the more severely having through it though not wilfully disappointed your LADYSHIP and given you so much unnecessary trouble  I have the honour to be Madam Your Ladyship's Most obliged And obedient servant C DIBDIN  Sheffield    January    As I could have proved loss of time and money in this transaction I think it would have been no bad hit to have proposed to Mr TUCKERwho be it known is a worthy member of the lawan action against Mr WEBB for if one may judge by the liberal offer of the half crown he would have joined issue in such a business with me But adieu Mr TUCKER and adieu ROTHERHAM An Irish jolmon to whom I was relating the story cried out  "ROTHERHAM Ah now for the future will you be after changing the R into a B and calling it BOTHERHAM  Laughing at these disappointments I began to anticipate the advantages of a visit to MANCHESTER where as my recommendations were good and the inhabitants were said to emulate the spirit of LIVERPOOL I had no doubt but I should reap a plentiful harvest In my next you will be able to judge how far my expectations were verified Adieu Yours  C DIBDIN  London    March    LETTER LII  LOCAL PREJUDICE  "  Time that on all things lays his lenient hand  "  Yet tames not this  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  ON Saturday January the th I went from SHEFFIELD to MANCHESTER by the way of CASTLETON and of course over those tremendous hills which form the most romantic part of the wonders of the Peakbut these I shall more particularly describe hereafter On the Sunday I waited on two gentlemen of consequence in MANCHESTER and came away so satisfied that I flattered myself I should find equal success there to that I met with at LIVERPOOL In the highest spirits therefore I advertised at a venture three nightsTuesday the fifteenth Thursday the seventeenth and Friday the eighteenthand on those three nights I received almost  one half  of the sum which the  last night  yielded me at LIVERPOOL The reception of the entertainment smacked a little of HALIFAX the judges  "bore a  wary  eye"  and people holding tight the captive half crown made strict enquiries into the value to be received before they could muster up resolution to liberate the coin To say the truth I was at last ashamed of them and out of pity relieved them from their uneasiness by bidding MANCHESTER adieu  To reverse what I have said of LIVERPOOL let me not be censured iffaithful to my promise of telling the truthI should be obliged to place MANCHESTER  in an unfavourable point of view My disappointment there will tell the story for me At LIVERPOOL I had no previous recommendation that could influence the leading people At MANCHESTER a gentleman of the first consequence in the town introduced me personally to all whom he could devise might be of service to me and on my account gave a supper to which he invited a large number of his particular friends on the night  before  the first performance Nor did they want a reporter and a very able one of what they were going to hear One of the gentlemen present had been at the amusement the last night at LIVERPOOL and spoke in the kindest way not only of the thing itself but of the liberal treatment I had received instancing in particular that as the concert had been on that very night many who had indispensible engagements there just made their appearance and then devoted the remainder of the evening  to me  a kind of attention he wished to see imitated at MANCHESTER Nevertheless the fact was as I have related At my coming away I might have had any thing if I would give them a night or two more which I took as it was meanta mere promiseand declined it as it deserved  It was allowed on all hands I had been very ill treated and it was said as I had failed in the  entertainment  it should be made up to me in  subscription  and they hoped if I found that to be the case I would yet in the course of some weeks pay them another visit This I promised to do but passing two months afterwards through the place and finding that there was not a single  additional  name to my  subscription  I forewent my intention of calling on any person beside the booksellersand left MANCHESTER with an opinion which I am very sorry to be convinced it merits  Let me not however be so ungrateful as to neglect saying that from one gentlemanwhose name all MANCHESTER will recollect without my mentioning itI received a warm and friendly attention beyond my abilities to describe If he had intreated for a favour to be conferred on himself he could not have been more solicitous more anxious or more industrious Indeed I  wish I had never gone to MANCHESTER for I am sure there are many of those who call themselves his friends whomafter this businesshe can never cordially think so I take leave in this place to thank that gentleman and to assure him that no length of time or change of situation shall ever efface his kindness from my memory  The business would have turned out better if it had been undertaken by any body but this gentleman and will it be believed why He knew nothing of music 'Twas in vain that he held out with the greatest goodnature  'Am I obliged to learn  sol fa  to receive pleasure when I hear an agreeable song'  "Mr DIBDIN ought to have been taken up by the conoscenti"  who I would lay my life would be the very first to pick a hole in his coat  This and the promised pleasure of the ensuing week when a new organ was to be opened at their concert room deprived me of all the  gentlemen  musicians Mr GREEN who was putting up the organ was a deity among them Have you seen him What sort of man is he Oh sir he is a wonderful creature In short they were so full of it that I expected to see a portrait of the organ and organmaker in the next MANCHESTER  print  and yet with all this fuss when the grand day came they had notafter such an expence and so long a noticetwothirds of the number that usually attend a common concert at LIVERPOOL  The narrowness that characterises the people of MANCHESTER is not confined to their pleasures it is evidently apparent in their trade Considering them as a community they are like an army of MERCENARIES At their head are a few individuals of consequence under whom all the rest are doomed to serve in perpetual subordination but LIVERPOOL is a corps of volunteers in which any may rise by industry merit and perseverance to the highest posts Some few at MANCHESTER must assuredly be immensely wealthy but it is impossible that it can boast within a prodigious sum indeed the aggregate riches of LIVERPOOL As therefore the wealth falls comparatively  into a few handsthe tradesmanlike plodding routine of whose business is to pay weekly wages and settle short creditsthere cannot be the same extension of ideas the same necessity for a large scale of calculation for a competent knowledge of the comparative interests of nations for clear and welldigested general intelligence and all those other important mental requisites which make up the broad comprehensive pursuits of a merchant In short MANCHESTER where a small number hoard considerable wealth and the rest are merely paid for their labour cannot on the scale of commerce be put in competition with LIVERPOOL where the tide of treasurelike the sea that produces itrolls in a wide and expansive circulation nor is it more conducive to private and partial advantage than general convenience  Men however of these contracted principles generally are strictly honest and possess the lesser virtues with as much punctuality and exactness as they honour a bill of exchange and there can be no doubt but from the timidity attendant on the common moral duties of life and an anxiety to comply as far as men can with the letter of that religion they punctually attend the ceremonies ofby way of example to their children and servantsthe humanity so evidently manifest in the present efforts to abolish the  slave trade  had its rise The motive beyond contradiction is laudable  After examining in my next letter whether the people of MANCHESTER get or lose by setting themselves up rather as  judges  than as  lovers  of MUSIC I shall proceed to investigate their arguments relative to this important subject place those of LIVERPOOL by the side of them and see whether their general policy merits that attention from the legislature they expect or whether it has proceeded from that ruling passion which POPE says time itself cannot tame and he might have added had he known my friendship any more than it can the sincerity with which I profess to be  Truly yours C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LIII  CRITICS AND CRITICISMS  "  The sports of children satisfy the child  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  SOME years ago there was a party of critics who constantly made a point of attending the  theatres  They were always headed by a chief whom they distinguished by the name of Mr TOWN and this gentleman being chosen for his superior adroitness at discovering the faults of authors very gravelyin the name he had the modesty to assumepronounced the fate of many a trembling poet and composer It happened however after a length of time that indifferent people who really went to the  theatres  to be pleased and to judge for themselves thought proper to take up the business and a few ineffectual struggles over Mr TOWN and his partizans were obliged to leave the field in disgrace and withdraw to pot houses their master's offices or such other obscure retreats from which they originally issued in arrogant expectation of giving the ton to an opulent metropolis in an enlightened age  A most ludicrous instance of the dismission of an actor through the  fiat  of Mr TOWN happened in Goodman's Fields A GENTLEMAN was announced for the character of MACBETH and went thro' it with so much reputation that it was agreed to give it out for the following night A Miss BUDGEL played LADY MACBETH and it so happened that during his acquaintance with that lady at the different rehearsals he fell passionately in love with his  theatrical  wifewhich misfortune might not have happened to him had she been his  real  one During the time of the performance he was more enraptured than ever After it was over standing near her by the side of the scenes receiving her warm compliments and congratulations an actor who had personated one of the witches was sent on the stage to announce a repetition of the performance on the following night The audience the moment the man appeared burst into a loud laugh MACBETH could not conceive whence this arose till looking on the stage he saw the actor who had began to arrange himself for the farce with his hair sinely dressed and some of the witches rags hanging about him  "God bless me"  cried he  "'tis mighty ridiculous to send this stupid fellow on the stagewhat shall we do"  'My dear Sir  said Miss BUDGEL  'you have nothing for it but to give it out yourself'  "My dear creature"  returned the charmed MACBETH  "I'll do itmy sweet Miss BUDGELdear charming Miss BUDGEL"  On he rushed full of the idea of Miss BUDGEL and as soon as he could be heard he thundered out  "Ladies and gentlemen to morrow eveningMiss BUDGEL will be  done over again  "  Mr TOUN found something indelicate in this business and poor MACBETH was banished from the theatre  This party has never been entirely quelled their fury however now vents itself only in bickerings at coffee houses snarling in the box lobby or now and then a squib in the newspapers but this last never happens unless interest be made with the understrappers when the editor is out of the wayfor free tickets the performance of now and then a farce and other douceurs have locked up the newspapers from the admission of any strictures relative to the theatres but such as are within the description of Mr SHERIDAN's list of  puffs  in  The Critic  Lest this last policy however should not be sufficient to insure to the  managers  all the success it may be  convenient  to commandfor that it has been sometimes thought expedient to accelerate the damnation of pieces I  know  to be a facta formidable phalanx of  orderly  people are stationed to crush in its infancy every attempt at a riot These have their various tasks assigned them and to say the truth they have often as hard parts to play as those on the stage  Sometimes it is the duty of these  theatrical  auxiliaries to make the most disturbances themselves in order to drown one clamour with another An Irishman being witness to this and asking a person near him what could induce those people to make such a noise was informed they had all come in with  orders  "Well then upon my soul"  said he  "I never saw a set of  orderly  people so  riotous  in all my life"  Through these and other wise precautions theatrical matters are put upon so desirable a footing that it is not what the town has  an opinion of but what the manager through interestto oblige a favourite or some such equitable motivechuses to obtrude on the public which we see continually crammed down their throats and which has so perverted the original institution of the drama that it would be as useless to search for morality wit taste genius or any intrinsic requisite of the stage in most of the modern dramatic productions as for  charity  in the heart of an USURER or  truth  in the tongue of a HYPOCRITE  Scions from this old stock of party seem pretty freely to have spread themselves over most of the towns of consequence in this kingdom Playhouse critics however have in the country very little to do for by then they have seen  Macbeth  two or three times break his truncheon  Richard  start at the ghosts all the men have fallen in love and all the women envied some  blooming  actress of  sixty  and a few of the first rate having gone to LONDON for orders and seen the performers there have pronounced the country actors to be  damned stuff  expended curiosity dies away and the unfortunate sons and daughters of  Thespis  having stamped roared grinned and squalled as long as any 'prentice boys are to be found to make up their gallery are obliged to take to their cart and undergo the same humiliation in some other place  Musical critics  have a great deal more to do An attorney's clerk who can play WEIDEMAN's minuet joins a mercer's apprentice who from frequenting hops has learnt to scrape a little of one of the city waites The attorney decampedperhaps after being pilloried for perjury and the mercer become a bankrupt the clerk and the apprentice are in business for themselves Perhaps one becomes an alderman and the other a townclerk A subscription is now proposed a concertroom is built where the MERCER  leads  and the ATTORNEY  plays solos  The plan is at length extended till in the raceweek at the assizes or some other public season whatever singer happens then to be popular is invited an oratorio performed and Messieurs LATITAT  and REMNANT quit the  red tails  and the  quality binding  to emulatein noise at leastthe festivals of the Abbey  I really mean no more by my MERCER and ATTORNEY than the latter would by A and B did he put a case What I have instanced is virtually the fact and it has this operation If it so happen that the  lovers  of music outnumber the  judges  as they call themselvesevery thing will be conducted upon a broad liberal plan and the concert do honour to the place by giving encouragement to men of abilities and refining the taste of the inhabitants if on the contrary the  judges  have a majority it will be carried on upon a narrow jealous contracted scale The music will be injudiciously chosen an unnecessary consequence assumed and at length what was meant as an harmonic meeting will become a scene of confusion till the gentlemen players have no opportunity to display the brilliancy of their superior talents but thro' the mortifying medium of private meetings at each other's houses At LIVERPOOL the  lovers  have the majority  twenty  perhaps  fifty  to one At MANCHESTER I am afraid it goes as strongly in favour of the  judges  Let them therefore take care not to follow the example of LEEDS whereand I have already shewn whythere will not in all probability next year be a concert at all None of this would however be worth a comment if the sports of these childrenlike the others in the fable of the frogswas not the death of genius and consequently the cause of stagnating that profession they pretend to encourage  Yours Very sincerely C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LIV  MANCHESTER VERSUS LIVERPOOL  "  You have among you many an hired slave  "  Shall I say marry them to your children  "  Let them be free  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  THE objections which originated at MANCHESTER and which have since extended to a large part of the kingdom against the slave trade are as follow  That it is a disgrace to humanity and a reproach to a nation which boasts the mildest government and professes the justest religion upon earth to buy and sell our fellowcreatures  That the English not contented with the prisoners taken in those wars among the different powers o  the coast of AFRICA which are provoked by their own jealousies and other private motives irritate the natives to commit partial depredations on each other and thus unnecessarily are the cause of spilling human blood and laying waste the habitations of harmless and peaceable individuals for the purpose of supplying slaves for the markets in the WESTINDIES  That these poor wretches are treated with the most inhuman cruelty that on board of ship they are stived down in the hold without the smallest respect to sex or age or any regard to common decency and that if they repine chains whips and thumbscrews bring them to a sense of their miserable condition and the scene often ends with their embracing death to free them from a worse calamity that this cruelty extends throughout the whole term of their slavery whichunless they can raise a sum generally impossibleis for life that they are cartwhipt and treated with much other cruelty under which a white man would expire for the most trivial faults and that four years generally wear outowing to this reiterated torturethe most robust constitutions among them when they fall willing victims to their dreadful fate which becomes a standing and indelible reproach to the name of Englishman  That there have been some instances to the contrary since all the world is not possessed of the same want of feeling that indeed they have been rare but when they have happened the planter has found his first stock become sufficiently numerous to answer all his purposesfor by gentleness and kind treatment they have increased astonishingly and as his humane endeavours have been evidently visited by a blessing from heaven he has amassed immense richeswhile the negroes have extolled  him  as a  benefactor  whom they expected to find a grievous and oppressive  task master  That a planter may take away the life of a slave without being in the smallest degree accountable for his actions  That the GUINEA trade over and above the other evils which attend it is the destruction of many brave Englishmen inasmuch as that the flower of our intrepid tars find a grave upon the coast of AFRICA  That the abolition of this unnatural traffic would be rather a benefit than a disadvantage as to the consumption of our commodities for that we might then have returns in articles the produce of that country  That a total abolition of the slave trade and nothing less would go to a reform of the grievances arising from it for by being convinced that they could no longer recruit their stock from the old market planters would cease to be wantonly cruel and naturally turn their thoughts to the care and preservation of the slaves then upon their hands imitating the single instance of the merciful WestIndian before mentioned which would produce many great and salutary effects The planter contenting himself with the slaves already in his possession would as the negroes are naturally prolific increase his stock every year also having no more purchasemoney to pay he could in a short time be enabled to part with his sugar and rum cheaper than formerly and thus we could afford to undersell all the other WestIndia islands That these desirable blessings would perpetuate the merciful reign of GEORGE the Third and finally to the end of time stand forward as as an example of humanity unparalelled in the annals of the world  Many other inland towns having caught fire at the long enumeration of  grievances  sustained and advantages that would arise from the extirpation of the cause of those grievances have to their honour taken up the subject and in a variety of petitionsamong which that of SHEFFIELD is one of the best writtenbesought parliament to interpose their authority and put a stop to this growing evil and they hold out what appears to be a strong proof of the handsome disinterestedness of MANCHESTER namely that their goods go now to purchase the African slaves whereas they are willing to forego all advantage as  dealers  rather than be remiss in their duty as  men  These petitions look forward to the happy consequences that they say would be derived from so noble an exercise of English philanthropy In them  is introduced every argument that generosity can dictate and the most powerful language used to intreat the legislature to protect the savages and to induce the merchants who have an interest in that trade nobly to throw it up with the same greatness of mind in which they have been set so laudable an example by the benevolent inhabitants of MANCHESTER  Besides the petitioners a number of societies have formed who split the different questions into every possible division but as this would take off from the solemnity of the business and seem as if I wished to supply LIVERPOOL with opportuity to introduce palliating subterfuges I shall in my next letter let them meet the question on its present ground After which the reader and I will fairly compare both argumentswhich done I shall leave him as a jury to decide upon the merits of the case  Mercy upon poor LIVERPOOL if the arguments of MANCHESTER be found as infallible as that I am  Most truly And faithfully yours C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LV  A VINDICATION  "  To do a great right do a little wrong  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  IN reply to these charges LIVERPOOL says  That if there can be no reason supported by sound policy legislative necessity or any of those indispensable urgencies which in all politics occasionally introduce a partial and apparent oppression for the sake of general convenience the African  slave trade  is as it has been representedan infamous traffic and a disgrace to the national character of the English but if it be made appear that it is perfectly expedient and also that it is a blessinginstead of a misfortuneto the savages whose Situations are so loudly and vehemently deplored they conceive the various petitions for its abolition ought to be thrown outthough certainly originating from benevolent intentionsas frivolous and vexatious  That so false is the report that the English provoke wars up the country on the coast of AFRICA for the purpose of purchasing slaves no Englishman ever yet returned who ventured five miles from the shore That were the English so inhuman as to meditate any such thing it is perfectly unnecessary The nations on the coast of AFRICA are remarkably prolific and naturally  lazy cultivation is scarcely known among them and fishing and hunting procure them the only blessings of life their savage nature is capable of entertaining a conception of There are among them many tribes and they are never without being in some place or other at war The prisoners made in these wars are doomed some to be  sacrificed  some  eaten  for they are cannibals to a manand some  sold  These last are purchased by the ENGLISH the DUTCH the FRENCH the PORTUGUESE the SPANISH the DANES and as all the world knows by many other nations Do all those go up the country to provoke wars Or do they lay in wait for the poor captives who are tricked by the insidious arts of Englishmen into unnecessary quarrels Bravery and all the generosity attending on it is the characteristic of Englishmen Why then should their fellow country men load them with such unworthy suspicions But the wars alone do not furnish the slaves sold upon the coast of GUINEA If a negro have thirty wives they are his slaves so are their children and it is not uncustomary to see a man sell his whole family Of the poor devoted wretches taken in war those who are sold are the happiest unless it can be proved that they are treated with all that cruelty which again is rather harshly laid to the charge of Englishmen in which case indeed  death  were desirable These poor wretches are brought forthsuch a number are put apart to be EATEN at the public sacrifices the rest are carried to marketthe refuse of whom which always amounts to a considerable number are beheaded and thenor perhaps alive as a prey to the sharksthrown into the sea A gentleman from whose mouth this is taken says that a Captain FARRER after having purchased as many as his ship would conveniently contain saw those he had refused to buy beheaded before his face to the number of sixtytwo  That on board of ship no slave was ever treated but with the greatest mildness and lenity unless he were mutinous in which case common policy will make it necessary to be a little rigorous That the accommodations are studiously laid out for their convenience  This I am competent to speak to having myself examined a Guineaman with the most minute attention  and every effort exerted to preserve  them in health and vigour Indeed if Englishmen had all that ferocity at present attributed to them if they could be hardened enough to gall a poor defenceless slave with chains flog him into sickness and invent new horrors to increase the calamity of his situationtheir interest would forbid it They must be madmen to brave an unhealthy clime and expend immense sums to purchase a set of miserable objects merely to exercise on them so much wanton barbarity When the slaves come to the WestIndian by being repurchased at a higher price it still more behoves their masters to attend to their treatment They are certainly set to work but their labour is not within any degree of comparison equal to that of a farmer's man who at the harvest time has not a single hour's cessation from binding and carrying from three o'clock in the morning till nine at nightwhereas a negro can never work but from six to six In short any English labourer is worked much harderbut then the climate Why it is congenial to their naturebut the cart whip Is nothing They are lazy beyond any thing that can be conceived and if they were not stimulated to it would do nothing But it is a mistake that a planter can whip a negro to deathhe must receive but thirtynine lashes and if every one of the thirtynine were ten they would be still nothing to a dozen at the gangway That so far from the planter's treating them with any thing but general kindnessfor he must not suffer them to get the upper hand of him unless he chuses to have his throat cutevery negro has his little spot of ground from which the markets are supplied with vegetables on a Sunday with the produce of which they make little parties of pleasure have their balls and different pastimes and unless it be some few moody malecontentswhich are to be found in all statesare as happy as any people under the sun Neither is this ground taken away from themas some assertwhen they have brought it to perfection for if this were the case where would they get the money to purchase their freedom which happens every day  In short a negro's idea when he is purchased is that he is to be eaten and as nothing can induce him to drive this idea from his imaginationfor  persuading him to the contrary confirms it the stronger as he thinks he is only told so that he may become  chearful  and get  fat  therefore they generally come to market very thin which probably has given rise to the report of their being cruelly treated at seabut when he finds he is only to work and sees himself in the midst of his countrymen who have wives and families and are happy only upon condition that they labour a little he like them buckles to his situation and finds that the bread he regularly earns by industry is sweeter than the precarious subsistance he before picked upwhich perhaps was not procured till his poisoned arrow had drank the blood of his countryman  I will not say how far 'tis expedient by doing a little wrong to do a great rightbut we will go on with the reasons of LIVERPOOL after I have once more subscribed myself  Yours Very faithfully C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LVI  THE ARGUMENTS OF LIVERPOOL FINISHED  "  If this be trueas true it seems to be  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  THE objections of LIVERPOOL to the assertions of MANCHESTER go on thus  That certainly those who treat the slaves with the most lenity stand a chance of being best assisted by their services but the instance adduced that they are likely through good treatment alone to grow sufficiently populous for the WESTINDIES to need no further supply of them is a most extraordinary assertion It is well known there are very few women brought from AFRICA and many of these through their connections with white men get their liberty This is certainly a subject not to be defended upon rational principles but it is a worldly blessing which the negroes have a very strong relish for and that the fact exists witness all those degrees of complection under the titles of Mulatto Mustee c who at last enjoy the immunities of Englishmen and become planters themselves Besides it can never be credited that if there were any possible means of keeping up a sufficient stock without a fresh supply that men would lavish away large sums to purchase new slaves merely for the pleasure of treating them ill  That a planter cannot take away the life of a slave without being accountable for his actions The laws formerly were very loose on this subject and murder of this kind has been committedand so it has in ENGLANDwith impunity There was always however a heavy fine for this crime and in aggravated cases the punishment was never less than death and what is this but our distinction of manslaughter and murder These laws however before MANCHESTER said a word on the subject it was thought necessary to render more rigid and JAMAICA has already determined to make this crime death without benefit of clergy  An act to this effect has since passed  but even if these laws did not exist there is an unfeeling cruelty beyond description in a man's coolly sitting down and supposing that his fellow creatureshis countrymencan depart from those sensations by which alone they deserve to be linked to society and deliberately commit murder to their manifest disadvantage in the moment a poor wretch needs most his pity and compassion merely because that wretch is in his power No animal in the circuit of creation ever took a life but to gratify hunger or satiate revenge To the latter ignoble propensity man most assuredly is too much addictedbut not more in the WESTINDIES than in ENGLAND or any other part of the world nor indeed are Englishmen more remarkable for this savage brutality than the inhabitants of any other nation why then in a moment of forward and unnecessary zeal single out the English West India planters in particular as the perpetrators of unprovoked and useless barbaritywhich were they capable of they would deserve to be swept from the face of the earth  That nothing can prove so decidedly the superficial and fallacious principles upon which the inhabitants of MANCHESTER ground their arguments as their assertion that the GUINEA trade is the destruction of some of our bravest seaman It is well known that when king's ships are paid off unhappy sailors who have so nobly maintained during a war the glorious naval superiority of Englishmen take to bad courses for want of employ and that the  gallows groans with those neglected objects of bravery who perhaps a few months before were the dread of their enemies Is it wonderful then that those who have the resolution to withstand the temptations which seduced their companions should leave their countrywhich they must do or starveupon  any terms  But this object is scarcely worth contending forthe sailors who man the Guineamen are very few of them of this descriptionthey are mostly such wretches as having escaped justice in this country are obliged to fly for it may be fairly averred that the vessels bound to AFRICA by taking such pests of society with them go more to the prevention of depredations on the public than all the watchfulness of the English police To say the truth these ought most to be terrified at the chains in which they are sure to be manacled whenever they treat the slaves with cruelty  That if the assertion be founded  "that it would be rather a benefit than a disadvantage to abolish the slave trade because we might then have returns for our commodities in articles the produce of AFRICA"  it contradicts that which went before for in this case would not the sailors be as likely to find a grave upon that coast in any common  trading voyage  as by  bartering for slaves  Besides this holds out a sort of argument that the disinterestedness of MANCHESTER is not quite so clear as upon the first blush it appeared for if a mutual commerce of produce for produce could be brought about the MANCHESTER goods might in that case not only be sold in as large quantities but probably to much greater advantage But after all what is the value of the produce of AFRICA What of consequence have we ever done even with SENEGAL If we could  colonize  indeedbut then would not the death of the emigrants be an improvement on the cruelty which it is said has stimulated us to carry so many sailors to their graves in that unwholesome country  That a total abolition of the slave trade would shake the very existence of our WESTINDIA possessions for there cannot be a falser argument than that  a stock of slaves is to be kept up without a constant supply from AFRICA and as to the visionary notion of putting them on a footing with hired servants 'tis too ridiculous to deserve a thought In short were the slave trade put an end to the French and others who at present participate with us upon an equal footing the advantages arising from the produce of the Caribbee Islands would then come at their produce upon better terms and in greater abundance and thus would one exertion of humanity perfectly laudable in private speculation in its public operation train with it the most pernicious and destructive consequences  These arguments have branched into a multitude of others to which MANCHESTER has  replied  and LIVERPOOL  rejoined  the material points however are contained in what I have already set down but this controversy has drawn from LIVERPOOL a question of certainly much greater magnitude than the slave tradeand it is this  "Were it not wiser and even more humane before we carry our clemency to AFRICA to exert it a little for the relief of that oppression under which our fellow subjects groan  at home  "  Some of their observations on this subject which are very pointed shall make up a part of the next letterthis I finish without any farther comment since this important subject is a pending one and will no doubt undergo a full and satisfactory investigation Then to say that at any rate the exertions of MANCHESTER are praiseworthy and if their prayer had gone no further than to a correction of abuses not one word would or could have been said against it for in that case the reasonableness of their demand would have been as evident as that I am  Yours With the most perfect sincerity C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LVII  A PROOF THAT THERE ARE MORE SLAVES THAN THOSE UPON THE COAST OF AFRICA  "  Charity begins at home  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I shall now speak to the grievances which exist at home and are said by LIVERPOOL to have thrown such a shadow over the present  soi disant  philanthropic exertions as almost totally to eclipse them  These are comprehended in a general abuse and wilful perversion of the spirit of our laws Hence all the distresses to harmless and industrious families by kidnapping and pressing for the army and navy through which deserted wives and children are committed to the care of merciless overseers and unthinking boys in time of peace flogged to death for desertion  An instance of this kind lately occurred which plainly evinces that if the  laws  of this country are mild the  execution  of them is cruelly rigourous In the course of last month at DOVER a lad of eighteen was sentenced to receive a thousand lashes for desertion They had given him five hundred whenin terms of the most moving supplicationhe implored a respite of the remainder of his sentence crying out in accents scarcely utterable through the violence of his agony  "that his heart was breaking and he should die under it if they flogged him any longer"  regardless however of his entreaties they continued their unmerciful work till at the end of six hundred and fifty lashesperceiving him actually dyingthey removed him to the guardhouse where he expired the next morning Query whether this is not at least a march for any cruelty that has been practised in the WESTINDIES There is certainly great opportunity for abuses to creep into martial laws and it originates from this Those who are most likely to commit crimes cannot be tried by their peers Thus private soldiers and foremast men are generally punished with rigour and the  crimes  of officers too often palliated and softened into  errors  My brother assured me the following is a fact A strange eccentric fellow who was a cook's mate on board a man of war among other singularities used to amuse the sailors with tricks on the cards cups and balls and other feats of  legerdemain  The captainwho was not blest with a very brilliant understandinginstead of seeing this matter in the harmless light it deserved found in his idea something very reprehensible in it The sailor was ordered into his presence and told that he had heard strange things of him  'Have you indeed your honour'  said JACK  'what are they sir if I may be so bold'  "Why"  said the captain  "they say you are a  conjuror  "  'Lord bless your honour'  answered the tar  'why then if that's the case they says strange things of your honour'  "Of me you rascal why what you impudent dog do they say of me"  'Why they says and please your honour as how your honour is  no conjuror  '  This tho' there was no offence in it from the heart ought to have procured the sailor at least a reprimand if not a slight punishmentfor certainly the barrier of subordination ought never to be overleaped The captain however determined upon a more complete revenge than was then in his power dismissed him with a smilebut from that moment privately set him down in his black book No effectual opportunity occurred to gratify this smothered revenge till the sailor having got drunk ashore neglected to return at the appointed time with his companions This being the moment the captain wished for poor JACK was tried for desertion and sentenced to be  keel hauled  When he was brought forward to suffer his sentence he begged leave to speak to the captainto whom he said  'I am sentenced your honour to undergo a very heavy punishment though I have done nothing to deserve it but I have been tried by a court martial of  captains  had I been an officer my tricks upon the cards would have been a  genteel amusement  my  crimes  all  errors  and my  slaying ashore  a  frolic  God bless you sir and all the harm I wish you is that for the next crime your honour commits you may be tried by a court martial of  foremast men  and now for DAVY JONES's  locker  '  Saying which words he jumped overboard  Hence all  the injuries sustained by the constitution owing to smuggling through which the  fair  trader fails and the  nesarious  one becomes opulent  Certainly this fact exists  through which the exciseman keeps his horse and his girl and spends five hundred a year though he receives from government but fifty  I saw myself a letter from an exciseman to a captain of a ship in which were these words  'Sir I understand you want to land some goods on Friday in the afternoon therefore at that time I shall contrive to be three miles off on  government business  "  through which are levied shop and other grievous taxes whose produce the customs and excise alone would yield were they not defrauded by those who smuggle and others who countenance smugglersand through which a few halfankers of brandy are  seized by consent to cover the running of valuable goods to an immense amount Hence come all the evils arising from imprisonment for debt through which an unmerciful creditor has been known to decide upon the  liberty property  and even LIFE of an oppressed debtor  Instead of commenting on this subject in a note I shall reserve it to make up my next letter  through which attornies swarm in this country like locuststhrough which the villain is sure to escape and the unfortunate man to be punishedthrough which rogues in prison banquet in luxury and innocent men envying the milder lot of felons  petition  to be transported to BOTANY BAY  This instance happened about a twelvemonth agothe debtors in Newgate seeing the preparations for transporting the felons to BOTANY BAY petitioned to go with them  and lastlyfor were I to enumerate all the instances they adduce and the variety of partial evils arising from them the remainder of this publication would not contain themhence come the inefficacy of the penal laws through which thieves thrive in the neighbourhood of justicethrough which informers who are the only instruments to put the laws in force are deemed infamousthrough which justice is made a trade and lawless bandittis are every thing but protected by those whose duty it is to exterminate them  This is a field on which Mr CLOUGHof whom I had formerly the honour to speakwould largely expatiate His doctrine was that thieves are encouraged by the runners of rotation offices tillas they express it  "their time is come"  and to inure them to their certain fate they make a point of attending executions He tells a story of one of these who used to be so much favoured as now and then to be permitted  for love  to help JACK KETCH to adjust the knot When his own hangingday arrived with all imaginable unconcern he looked up at the clock and said to one of his companions  "I say GEORGE I think we are  rather late today  "  His stories of the placid indifference with which these poor wretches submit to their fate were numerous and every one of them proved that it strong habit and example had not confirmed in them a belief as rivetted as that of soldiers and sailors as to their fate in battle that they were predestined to the gibbet many of them by being roused to their rational duties through the vigilance of the police might have become useful members of societybut the magistrates themselves know that as other children learn something to give the man idea of religion and morality so those in  St Giles's  are taught to lisp out the exploits of their fathers and nothing is so common as to hear a boy of five year's old talk of  "dying game"  I shall select one more of Mr CLOUGH's stories to finish this note  A poor fellow whose irons had just been knocked off in the pressyard was seen to whimper upon which Mr AKERMANwho bears the character of a thinking and considerate manpleased probably to see an unexpected example of feeling in one who had always appeared very hardened asked him with great kindness what troubled himsaying that any thing in his power that could alleviate this distress for the few short moments he had to live he should be welcome to  "as to your fate"  said he  "you seemed a few minutes ago to be very resigned to it"  'Lord love you'  replied the poor wretch sniveling  ''tis not thatas to hanging 'tis as well now as another timebut I have not sixpence to buy a natty nightcapand a man you know Master AKERMAN may as well go  dessent  out of the worldbut I should not mind it so much if that NED NUBBING CHEAT had not refused to lend me hisand that you know was damned illnatured for he can't want it till next sessions'  All these the people of LIVERPOOL are of opinion require a reformnot that they would wish any amendment that might go to the extirpation of the laws for they are evidently a  benefit  though their execution may be an  evil  and they conclude what they have offered on this subject by saying that though they would recommend a cure of home abuses as a project of amore sane and rational nature rather than a reform on the coast of AFRICA yet should the present complainants be really able to point out any abuses in the  slave trade  and hit upon an expedient that may go to their redress they will be the first to offer them their public thanks not from any ostentation of greater liberality than their neighbours but because in that case they will have done a desirable and material service to the community in general and in particular to the inhabitants of LIVERPOOL  In this state I leave the subject of the slave trade It was in some degree my duty to report as much as I knew of it and it would have exceeded my duty to say whose arguments are the most worthy attention The only circumstance I can speak to from my own conviction is the accommodations on board the Guineamen which are wonderfully calculated for the comfort and convenience of the slaves indeed the crew and even the officers themselves are very ill accommodated merely that the whole ship may be appropriated to the use of those objects on whose health and good treatment certainly depend the success of their voyage  Yours Very truly C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LVIII  A DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAW AND EQUITY  "  A Lawyer's is an honest employmentso is mine like me too he acts in a double capacityfor rogues and against them  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  HOWEVER expedient however wise however salutary may be the  political  JUSTICE of the laws respecting debtor and creditor in this country nothing can teem with more  moral  INFAMY than their execution A detension of the person has been thought by every wise man to be oppressive and even impolitic but I will not go upon that the laws  warrant  or at least  tolerate  it and I shall hardly betray so much folly as to offer a sentiment on what will never be effected till law lords cease to dictate on subjects that wholly apply to their own interest though the very same plea is at all times sufficient to render the testimony of a witness inadmissible in the courts  Any man who will make oath to a debt of ten pounds may arrest another and if he cannot give bail to the action put him in jail It is not necessary that there be such debt in actual existence for if any accounts have passed between the two persons and there should be only a balance of twenty shillings an oath may be  legally  made of the  whole  let the amount be ever so large and when the debtor is once in jail it will take  five terms  to bring the matter to a final issue provided the creditor chuse so long to procrastinate the  dispute Thus a man who only owes  twenty shillings  may in this country be imprisoned a year and a quarter lose his time and reputation pay fifty pounds for law and emancipate from his confinement a beggarwhereas common reason says that the creditor ought to have been compelled in the first instance to state the account fairly and receive his due without having it in his power to indulge an indignant and implacable revenge from which motive alone could spring a wish to harrass a fellowcreature for the pleasure of contemplating his sufferings But it will be asked whether creditors in general are so unnecessarily oppressive and if they are what can induce them to it My answer is there are three times the number of attornies that can honestly get employ in this kingdom From this it arises that when one of them is consulted instead of  healing  a breachwhich is his dutyhe makes it  wider  for indeed he must do so or starve Vengeance is always advised instead of compassion and this must be gone about in the most expensive way possible that they may more completely hamper the poor devil who has the misfortune to come under their hands The action commencedthe next object is to serve it in as disgraceful and inconvenient a manner as possiblefor lawyers as naturally study the interest of bailiffs as physicians do that of the apothecaries By this means they look out for red letter days and such other adventitious means as may put it as much as possible out of the power of the poor debtor to escape tillto use their own words  "every man has had a leg or a wing"  To explain myself We will suppose Saturday and Monday red letter daysthe defendant in this case is always arrested on a Fridaybut not before six o'clock in the evening Thus though he be prepared to give bail or pay the money he cannot be released till the following Tuesdaybecause the intervention of the two holidays and the Sunday preclude all possibility of searching the office though at the moment of the caption fifty to one but they know that there is nothing else against him During the four days he is in custody to a certainty every art is usednine times out of ten by the attorney but always by the bailiffsto induce other creditors to lay detainers against him At length after accumulated disgrace mortification  and expence by signing notes cognovits and warrants of attorney he purchases a temporary liberty at an immoderate disadvantageand after finding it impossible to fulfil these engagements so extorted he goes to prison for life at the will of the creditor If he be advised to resign himself to exonerate his bail he is told that if his creditors do not proceed in such a number of terms he can get a complete release from their power by superseding their actions This advice taken and a release obtained after a tedious imprisonment he is just where he set out and may be sued again on every debt for which he was imprisoned which is sure to happen if he have any thing to pay the costs  If the creditor go on to execution the prisoner is certainly locked up for life and the instances of disease famine and suicide in consequence which are apparent in more than that of JOHN SMITH and his wife who cut their children's throats and hung themselves prove pretty strongly that in this country a creditor may have a virtual power over the life of a debtor in which case I do not see why he should not be like SHYLOCK not only obliged to relinquish his demand but forfeit a part of his own property for the service of the state Then in vain might he retort  "Nay take my life"  and all he would be answered  "How shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none"  At the time LORD EFFINGHAMwith a benevolence that will reflect on him lasting honourineffectually owing to the interference of the law lords attempted a reform on this subject he gathered together many well attested cases to strengthen his arguments and prefaced them by saying that every case was a deep tragedymore were in preparation for him and one of them I know to be truth It was this A man in the year eightythree was five hundred pounds in debt An attorney a partner and a bailiff by false reports brought all his real creditors against him and added fictitious ones till having been in prison two years he obtained a release upon supersedeases from debts for which he could again be sued and having paid upwards of six hundred pounds  for law  he found himself between seven and eight hundred pounds in debt though in the interim he had not contracted a single new one One of these fictitious debts is worth notice This man was arrested for a  debt he  did not owe  The account on which it was pretended to arise having long before been liquidatedhe went to trial and obtained a verdict in his favour the plaintiff when an execution came to be sued out for the costs was in prison The defendant therefore was obliged to pay his own costs in this unjust action which amounted to seventeen pounds In short when a man delivers himself implicitly into the hands of an attorney there is no advantage that may not be taken of him and with safety for let the attorney undertake what he pleases the client is obliged to acquiesce and for God sake what man of common plain understanding unacquainted with all the different and equivocating constructions of the law can guard against the consequences that are sure to attend even a winning  cause    A plain wellintentioned farmer who appeared to be blest with strong intellectual faculties once set this matter very clear in the court of King's Bench On a trial before LORD MANSFIELD an action was brought to ascertain some privileges concerning the boundaries of two parishes upon which a great deal of money was spent to elucidate a question which was not of threepence consequence to either party In the course of the trial LORD MANSFIELD having taken notice of some strong pointed observations which had fallen from the farmer above mentioned he begged leave to ask him a few questions merely for information concerning the customs of overseers and other officers who manage the parish money The farmer with great chearfulness appeared ready to satisfy him and his LORDSHIP said  'in the course of your evidence I think you noticed that the parish money was very often improperly appliednow I do not mean to insinuate that you would be likely to misuse it but as you mentioned that you were once churchwarden if you have no objection I should wish to hear what was done with the money at that time'  "Why my LORD"  said the farmer  "the money was worse applied while I was churchwarden than ever I knew it in my life"  'Indeed'  said his LORDSHIP  'I should be glad to know how'  "Why my LORD"  said the farmer  "I'll tell you A gentleman who had lived some time among us went into Yorkshire where he died In his will he bequeathed about an hundred and twenty pounds to the poor of our parish We appiied for it often and often but 'twould not dothe executors and the lawyers and one or another were glad enough to keep the money in their hands for you know my LORD 'tis an old saying that might can overcome right Well we did not know what to do and I came to your LORDSHIP for advice You were then COUNSELLOR MURRAY I remember my LORD you advised us to file a bill in Chancery We did so and after throwing a great deal of good money after bad we got I think they call it a decree and such a decree it was that when all expences were paid I reckon we were about an hundred and seventyfive pounds out of pocket Now my LORD I leave you to judge whether the parish money was not likely to be worse employed while I was churchwarden than ever I knew it before"  what then must be a losing one  Look at the common expences of the most trifling trial and see what fortune can make a stand against going often to law No no let every man be wary how he is imposed upon but when he is so let him sit down contented with the first loss He may easily cure the sting of one  hornet  but what a plight he must be in if he be unwise enough to rouse THE WHOLE NEST But a  "lawyer's is an honest employment"  says  Peachum  I wish it was half so honest as I am sincere when I assure you that I am  Very faithfully Yours C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LIX  THE TOUR ENLARGED  "  A poor petty larceny rascalhe goes off the next sessions  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  FROM MANCHESTER I returned to SHEFFIELD where on the following week this TOUR was put to pressthe dates of the letters will shew how much of it was at that time written Having inspected the first sixtyfour pages whichexcept one or two half sheetsis all I have had opportunity to examine I went to LEEDS where with the advantage of LADY MEXBOROUGH's name I had a very good night at the assemblyroom on Monday February the eleventh My friend WARBURTON also acquainted me it was very much the wish of Mr FAWKES that I might have another night at YORK This I confess I had no great relish for but knowing well the powerful influence of Mr FAWKES and how much the inhabitants of that dull region are obliged to the taste and fashionable elegance of Mrs FAWKES for teaching them how to distinguish what ought to amuse them and set them examples of polished manners and finished good breeding I did myself the honour to call on that gentleman who assuring me his utmost interest should be used to make a night worth my while it was fixed for Thursday February the twentyeighth and in the interim I went on to DURHAM and NEWCASTLE Passing DURHAM I arrived at NEWCASTLE on Friday the fifteenth and the next day after delivering a recommendatory letter to a gentleman of some consequence who like the Irishman at BATH promised  GREAT THINGS and did  nothing  I waited on the  Mayor  and began my attack in form I performed four times with very nearly as bad success as at MANCHESTER The kind way however in which Mr HODGSON the printer testified his concern for what he was pleased to think want of taste in the people of NEWCASTLE was truly flattering and obliging He put a paragraph in his newspaper to induce a better attendance and he was indefatigable in promoting the subscription I here thank him for his handsome and gentlemanly treatment of me  I had trifled away ten days at NEWCASTLE when I was determined to repass DURHAM and get on to YORK For this purpose I setout on Sunday the twentyfourth but the weather being remarkably disagreeable I went no farther than DURHAM that night and having seen Mr EBDON the organist of the Cathedral whose candid and  untheoretical  sentiments greatly pleased me I resolvedas I had to play with my time till the following Thursdaythat I would stay and see what Monday night would produce It not only greatly exceeded my expectations but I was entreated to perform a second time which turned out to be nearly as productive as the first  During the time I was at DURHAM I had many kindnesses shewn me which I would more particularly notice but that my TOUR is hastening to its close Those that were public I received from Dr COOPERwhich has been a fortunate name to meMr BIRD Mr SMITH and several others whose names are in the list of subscribers the private ones from Mr EBDONfor I never acknowledge any thing as kindness but what is meant as an unaffected intention to please and oblige As to familiarity unnecessary and illassumed consequence and invitations to dinner merely to sport a sideboard it never yet had any attractions for me and therefore if any person at DURHAM should recognize this for the portrait of his conduct let it be a secret between him and mebut let him also endeavour to persuade himself that every man who accepts his acquaintance upon those terms laughs at him in his sleeve  Master HOULT at the  Red Lion  seemed anxious to be celebrated in this TOUR I am willing to tell the truth which I dare say is all he desires He appeared very anxious to please and undertook to give his sister at NORTHALLERTON a caution how she treated me on my return as that lady had been so accommodating on my road to DURHAM from YORK to put me into a damp bed What the caution was I will not pretend to say but certainly she gave me horses that knocked up between NORTHALLERTON and EASINGWOULD as to himself he saw I had two tolerable nights and thought I suppose he had a right to his share of themfor having left the bargain concerning the room to a sort of eventual decision though there could be no such virtual construction put on it he adhered to his bond as rigidly as SHYLOCK I had a part of the TOUR with me which he read and I remember appeared charmed with my account of JEMMY WALLIS at NEWARK If he conceived he merited a similar panegyric he will now see he and I are of different opinions  On my return to YORK the business of Thursday night was so spoken of that I really thought out of compliment to the lady who had taken so much painsand in obliging whom the inhabitants by the way would have paid themselves a complimentthat I should have found reason to change my tone I remember it was suggested to me that I should be obliged to rewrite that letter where speaking of cities I put YORK in so unfavourable a point of view Not a bit The night though it proved to the clearest demonstration the weight and consequence of Mrs FAWKES's name only confirmed me the stronger in my belief of their general shabbiness for I had not a promiscuous audience but a  party  of  ninetynine persons  which is an astonishing number to be brought through one interest to an assemblyroom in the country  A very extraordinary adventure happened to me at this time A decent man came into the parlour in which I was sitting at the Inn and after the most confused unconnected preface that can be imagined told me I had been  innocently the cause of injuring him with the people of YORK I begged to know how and he informed me that his business in that place was to deliver an entertainment somewhat similar to mine but that of course he was silenced by my arrival He then entered into a description of his distresses in most pathetic language calling himself a ruined clergyman saying he was driven to the last despair and that he had frequently been on the point of shooting himself at length calling me out of the room he said the smallest trifle would be of infinite service to him and entreated I would lend him  half a crown  This I gave him without hesitation and at his request also a ticket for the performance and he went his way When I came to examine his bills I found them so worded that he might have been mistaken for me He had followed exactly in my track and announced nothing more than that the gentleman who had some time before at such and such a town given his  Readings  and  Music  meant to repeat that entertainment and I afterwards learnt that at HULL and BEVERLY he entertained his audience with nothing more than the same lively picture of his distresses till they consented to go home and leave their money behind them  I should not have mentioned this here or at allespecially the business of the  half crown  had not Mr BLANCHARD the printerwho is another of my favouritescome soon after into the room when upon giving directions for some bills on the morrow something induced him to notice that there was a strange kind of man who had made some application to him to print bills  "but"  said he  "he made use of an odd recommendation for he said he was in the greatest distress"  In short listening to Mr BLANCHARD's account I heard every word that had just been repeated to me by the ruined clergyman which ended with the old request of the half crown which was of course given to him  This brings to my recollection an anecdote of Dr JOHNSON which has certainly escaped all his biographers though it be nevertheless truthat least if I may believe Dr GOLDSMITH who told me so on the very day that he said it happened GOLDSMITH and DAVIS the bookseller called one morning on Dr JOHNSON and found him in company of a man not only very worthless in his character but one who had been forward in abusing the doctor himself They saw him as this man went away put something in his handupon which GOLDSMITH expostulated with him saying no wonder such vipers got a living when they could be fostered by the very hand they wounded  'Fie doctor'  said he  'this man is one of the most infamous rascals that ever existed'  "I have nothing sir"  said the doctor  "to do with the man's  vices  he asked me for  half a crown  and I  gave it him  "  "But"  said Mr BLANCHARD  "I should have let the half  crown business die had I not afterwards had reason to believe he is an impostor of some consequencefor a very little time after I saw him bowling along in a post chaise alone and having the curiosity to ask the landlord where he baited whither he was going I found the chaise was to take him  twentytwo miles  "  This gentleman attended at the room and what became of him ultimately I know not but he was certainly taken out by some man he had swindled and who had followed him from another town  Thus after having been so frequently taken for an impostor myself I at last met with a person who was really one and this  "petty larceny rascal"  after all was probably in many places more respected Here I recal to mind your kind letter now printed and the several friendly remarks you have since madeall which convince me how much credit I do myself in so often assuring you that I am  Yours Very truly C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LX  A THANKFUL ADIEU TO LIVERPOOL  "  Hail dear retirement  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  HAVING returned to SHEFFIELD and given directions for advertising three nights at LIVERPOOL I repaired thither and arrived on Tuesday the fourth of March As I necessarily passed through MANCHESTER I thought I might as well make some enquiry concerning the subscription which would of course set me to rights as to the attention that had been paid me in my absence Finding as I before represented that not a single name had been added to the list I thought it would be a folly to see MANCHESTER any more  At LIVERPOOLthe only place in all my  tour  to which I  returned  to any good purposeI had six handsome nights taking the average of them and it gave me pleasure to announce that I should finish my career in that spirited town My reception was certainly flattering to an excessif I could have dined in ten places at once  LIVERPOOL is remarkable of course for fine turtle A gentleman who is well known for distinguishing the best morsels received two cards of invitation to dinc on a turtle the same day at the same hour After balancing for some time which he should accept he determined to dine at both places To manage this he waited on the stewards of one feast and represented what an awkward hour they had chosen for their dinner  "What an absurdity"  said he  "to dine at  three o'clock  people who are on business all the morning will be starved besides all the world is getting into early hours now"  The stewards in short consented to have the dinner at  two  This point gained he posted away to the other stewards  "Good God"  said he  "what could possess you to appoint your dinner at  three o'clock  we shan't have done upon 'Changeour appetites won't be half upbesides how unfashionableall the world is getting into late hours In short when people meet at a feast business is over and therefore you should always have it as late as you can"  Here also he carried his point Repairing to the dinner at  two o'clock  he stuffed unmercifullywhen having previously ordered himself to be called out he went home took an emetic and appeared in high spirits at the other feast which had to oblige him been appointed at  sour  To keep my consistency however perfectly clear this gentleman is not a  merchant  but a  physician  I should have been welcome and indeed  kindness of this sort came so thick that I was obliged to decline all invitations lest I should be incapacitated from affording that entertainment for which purpose I went among them  On Tuesday the eleventh I attended at their concert and declare that I heard two acts from the  Messiah  performed much more respectably than I could have conceived Mr MEREDITH and Miss HARWOOD are known to have much merit in this style of singing Mr WILTON's precision and care in leading the band cannot be too much praised and Mr WAINWRIGHT conducted the chorusses in a very able and spirited style and also in a very delicate way gave us the second of HANDEL's concertos I have already noticed how expert the singers of YORKSHIRE and LANCASHIRE are at chorusses Those who performed them the night I speak of at LIVERPOOL did HANDEL as much credit as if they had been drilled by Mr JOAH BATES which between seven and eight hundred persons who were present can testify  Were I to speak fully of the attention paid me at LIVERPOOL I should have nothing else to say As therefore those who were so forward to please and serve me are the least conscious of itthe whole sum of their kindness being no more than the common exercise of that liberality which so remarkably characterises themI must content myself with feeling that which I cannot properly describe  I quitted LIVERPOOL on Friday the fourteenth of March having the night before exhibited myself as a public character for the  last time  passed on through BIRMINGHAM in my way to BRISTOL whither I went on private business spent three or four days with my friend BOYTON and finally arrived in LONDON on Saturday the twentysecond  My running account of places inns c and a few more gleanings will now wind up my TOURprevious to which however I shall go into the business of my negociation with Mr HARRIS and endeavour to account for its failure This I shall enter upon in my next letter That done my last remarks on the subject of music will naturally introduce a statement of my pieces and the profits which arose from them Thus every letter will lessen the frequencythough never the pleasurewith which I assure you I am  Most cordially Yours C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXI  THEATRICAL MATTERS  "  Time was when my approach  "  Had made a little holiday  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  YOU already know the nature of my application to Mr HARRIS in March and the substance of the answer I received From YORK in the following October I sent that gentleman a musical farce telling him that I had a firstpiece nearly ready and three other afterpieces which in a very short time I could perfect and also some good materials for pantomimes  I will confess to you that I chose to send the piece I set the least store by firstfor I have unfortunately upon these occasions a sort of  presentiment  and my feelings at that time I am free to declare did not very much lead me to place any great faith in Mr HARRIS's sincerity It was however a farce that as times go  CoventGarden  need not have been ashamed of Mr HARRIS returned one act of it saying  "it was taken from the French and like Sir JOHN VANBRUGH's  Country House  therefore it would not do but that whenever I would send any thing  completed  that would be of service to the theatre he should be glad to treat with me but not for hints or detached music for that they were crowded with unappropriated music by  the  best composers  "  I wrote him an answer to his letter saying  'I should be glad of  the other act of the farce  that I was sorry he thought indifferently of itthat I certainly took partly the idea of it from a French piece but I had not literally translated a single speech nor had I ever read VANBRUGH's  Country House  therefore it could not be so like either as to make his objection a substantial one for it was very easy to shew from whence almost every piece that had appeared for some years was taken and one might venture to add the same of those which would appear for some years to come I went on saying that I hoped he and I should agree better on what I should next send I begged however that he would explain himself in one point If he meant by the word  completed  that he expected me to send music as well as words I certainly could not consent to it as I thought I ought to be considered as perfectly competent to decide on its merits myselfthat I desired fairly and honourably to be understood to mean exactly what I had asserted that I was going to INDIA and wished very much to leave something behind me to have my fame rememberedfor which I should never stand candidate again I said that when I wrote to him some years ago on the same subject he thought that  hints  or  any thing else  from ME would be valuable to him and that I really did not believe my rivals had since given him reason to alter his opinion I had a variety of materials which would certainly be useful and indeed he must think so otherwise why  crowd  his theatre with  unappropriated music  for I flattered myself I had no right to be considered as an  inferior  master In short I told him if he thought I could leave him nothing that would be of advantage to him it would be a folly for us to have a single moment's further trouble on the subject'  This was the substance of my letter to which at GRANTHAM five weeks afterwards I received an answer and the second act of the farce  Mr HARRIS said  "He was sorry I had the trouble of sending again for the second actit had been mislaid by an accident"  "He had only to repeat to me that any work I might send completed should be read with attention and without delay and if found likely to succeed he should readily treat with me for the purchase of itbut not for any unappropriated or detached music"  This letter determined me to let nothing out of my hand till I had come at a fair explanation of the word  completed  and to do this I once more wrote to Mr HARRIS telling him  'that till he should please to explain that word matters must stand in  statu quo  for that I could not consent to send music for  inspection  Having received no answer to this letter not even when I arrived in LONDON the first thing I did was to take my final leave of Mr HARRIS in a letter a copy of which shall be transcribed for your perusal after I have once more subscribed myself  Your very faithful And obliged friend C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXII  AN ADIEU TO THE THEATRE  "  The post of honour is a private station  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I Shall now lay before you my letter to Mr HARRIS  To THOMAS HARRIS Esq  SIR  I have waited three monthswhich is something more than good manners allowsfor an answer to my last letter but as that quality makes no part in the  etiquette  of a MANAGER your silence excites in me no wonder It speaks however pretty emphatically and tells mewhich I really did not think in this instancethat you have been near a twelvemonth laughing at me In the month of March last I wrote to you offering to sale such materials as I had by me or could finish before I should quit ENGLAND You encouraged me in answer to send either pantomimes firstpieces or afterpieces  completed  Of this indefinite expression I have since repeatedly entreated an explanation telling you that if you expected me to send music for inspection I could not agree to itnor would I believe any man in his senses advise me The only answer I have received from you is a reiteration of the word without any elucidation of it and upon my pressing you three months ago for a  final  answer you  think proper to drop all correspondence with me I shall therefore take the liberty in this letterwhich you will be charmed to hear is the last you will receive from meto say that it is impossible but you must have a predetermined resolution not to accept any thing of mine  Had I gone upon the extensive sense of the word completed I must have sent you models for pantomimes as well as the stories and the musicand to what end To have had my pains requited by a refusal and hints taken from the materials Not by you however I acquit you of any such ideabut your people barren of genius would have been happy to catch at any thing original As to musicI must have been mad to have sent anythat would have been a glorious feast indeed for your compilersstill without your knowledge for they would find no difficulty in passing it on you for theirs I once imposed on you as  completely  though not so  nefariously  myself I certainly the first season after I returned from FRANCE took a particular pleasure in implicitly complying with every request you made me and this is I suppose what you meant when at the end of that season you said something very handsomely in a letter of my  zeal  for the interests of the THEATRE During the getting up of the  Touchstone  you desired me to remove a tune and make a new one in its stead It was my full intention to have been as complaisant in this instance as the rest but having an engagement I forgot it till the next morning There being no time to get it ready when I came to the THEATRE before the rehearsal and in FOULES's  The copist  room I made some trifling alteration in the accompaniments and marked the tune to be played a tone higher  I frequently did this with GARRICKfor why should one be dictated to by the absurd observations of men without cars who give unnecessary trouble to shew their own consequence  as to the melody there was not a note altered and every body but yourself knew it to be the same tune Thus  their  remarks that it was bettermeaning the alteration  your  coinciding with themthinking it a new tuneand  my  acquiescence  with both made as good an equivoque as ever Mr O'KEEFE introduced into any of his pieces  You  must  have known that I meant not to have sent you music subject to inspection but that you should take it upon my promise that it would be original and the best I could make Nay I particularly marked that in what I left behind me I should look to my professional fame in the strictest manner Upon this footing you certainly did not think proper to receive my productionsotherwise you would not have trifled with me  The conclusion is you either think my abilities impaired or that I have not now so much  zeal  for the interest of the THEATRE as I had ten years ago  'Tis evident I cannot now write any thing to please you for you return every thing I send you whereas formerlyand I can shew your own hand writing to prove ityou admit the merit of six pieces sent at one timeall of which it is true had success  See the statement of pieces  Will not the world be apt to think that the decay is rather in your judgment than in my abilities You very well  know  and I believe have  allowed  that I have as little of arrogance as to my productions as any man and yet I cannot but be alive to what I hear every day It has been my good fortune in the course of the last twelvemonth to see the public a little face to face and it happens to have been that part of the public which in great measure makes up your boxesand they assure me to an individual that I greatly improve both as an author and a composer you will therefore excuse me if I rather credit my benefactors than you  This allowed it can be nothing more than that in your opinion my  zeal  for the interest of the THEATRE  slackened  If vamping up old matter by giving it a new face if introducing stale hackneyed tunes and passages to the disgrace of taste and the total exclusion of genius and originality or if a servile obedience to the  ipse dixit  of the manager against the evidence of plain reason and common sense be  zeal  for the interest of the the THEATREaway with such zealI'll have none on'tand for this I believe I shall again be praised by the public  I should not have written this letter but have let the whole business die awayfor it otherwise had been scarcely worth a thoughthad I not been accused by many opulent and respectable characters of having in some way so deported myself as to have made it impossible for MANAGERS to treat with me otherwise I could not set up as an excuse for going to INDIA my having been driven from the THEATRE  I am sure you will allow that I have fairly stated the matter and that there is nothing between us but a difference of opinion concerning the meaning of a very common word which like TOUCHSTONE's  if  has so operated as to prevent any thing coming of our negociation in the course of which we have both acted in our situations  I  have as dependants should entreatedand  you  have not deigned to answer  My time therefore being so short as to make all accommodation impossibleand indeed were it longer nothing should shake my resolution of having done with the THEATREI shall finish this letterwhich I dare say has sufficiently tired youwith a most serious and solemn assurance that as a man I have and ever had the highest respect for youthat I have to thank you for a thousand instances of attention and politeness and the part of your conduct wherein I had only to consider you as a private gentleman  was ever handsome and manly and this opinion you may remember I felt and professed at the very moment those around you falslely persuaded you I had written a libel against you  A pamphlet was published in the year called  Coalition  or  Theatrical Monopoly  I really know not which It abused Mr HARRIS and I was said to be the author Mr HARRIS was undeceived and behaved very handsomely upon it Some of his privy counsellors however  now  are the same who were  then  Feeling these sentiments let me conjure you as a manager to open your eyesbanish every thing from your stage that can check the growth of geniuslet not quaintness tricks and shifts usurp the place of  weeping taste  and  desponding originality  In short with the MANAGER blend the MANso shall judgment rear its fostering standard and COVENTGARDEN be no longer the fountain of caprice but the source of real merit  Yet think not in this arrangement I affect to include myselffor I declare upon my veracity and let the world judge of its validity as I adhere to the declararion or recede from it that half the profits of your THEATRE should not bribe me to return I am sure never was the post of honour more a privater station than at present  Sir AdieuThough I have considered it as a duty incumbent on me to write you this letter be assured I do not mean it in any respect to breathe rancour You have seen how I make the distinction and I once more assure you that as a  man  and a  gentleman  you have not in the world a truer advocate or a sincerer wellwisher than  Your most obedient servant C DIBDIN  London    March    This matter has thus terminated and through you I give to the public a strong factwhich is worth a thousand arguments As a proof that every man who thinks independently must lay his account to having no concern with the THEATRE Mr SHERIDAN has the boldness to say in  The Critic  "that very few go through the fatigue of thinking for themselves"  If so we have only to lament that stage manoeuvres are not as  honest  as they are INGENIOUS and that the first dramatic writer of the day holds out fallacy as the principal ingredient in a theatrical composition That he has as little of originality in the plots of his pieces as Mr CUMBERLANDagainst whom he seems to head the whole force of his satireis certain I do not mean however to accuse him of imbecilityhe has genius equal to any thing but the generality of English audiences have been so used to  cayenne  and  high cookery  that he knew plain nature would stand no chance among them He is however the only man who has ventured to impose upon them and tell them so in the same breath but the English have such a redundancy of good nature that if a man arrogates a superiority supporting his pretensions at the same time with any formidable shew of ability their characteristic benevolence is at once appealed to and they implicitly give him credit for the very merit he asssures them he possesses  Thus men who have the constancy and resolution to climb any given height atchieve the task they have set themselves by adding perseverance and intrepidity to strong intellectual endowments strengthened by intense wary and correct observation There is however a want of feeling in this'tis a sort of poaching for fame  "while the fair hunter's cheated of his prey"  I know you think it a sort of dramatic sacrilege to attack the works of Mr SHERIDAN and this will in my next letter put me upon a cursory view of them for if I were capable of advancing any thing I could not prove I should be unworthy your friendship and have told you a falsity every time I have asserted that  I am Sincerely yours C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXIII  A BOLD UNDERTAKING  "  One man may steal a horse better than another look over the hedge  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  A Few words on Mr SHERIDAN's dramatic works and adieu to the  Theatre  except such circumstances relative to it as will necessarily come out in my statement of pieces  The Rivals  has had the least success and yet it is the most original of all his pieces It was nearly damned on the first night and Mr SHERIDANprofiting by the experience with which its reception furnished himwithdrew it with this remark  "I have now got the  last  and it shall be my fault if I don't make the shoe to fit next time"  His labour however being only cobler's work it required too much of method for his volatile genius to buckle to and we may venture to pronounce without any great outrage on probability that had not Mr SHERIDAN so much influence in the  theatre The Rivals  would never have made its appearance a  second season  It is a neat well written piece but has that sort of cold correctness which will not go to the galleries The incident from  The Nutbrown Maid  though written with great sweetness and delicacy is no more proper for the  theatre  than the fine strokes of a miniature painter would be in the finishing of flats and wings  All this perhaps inducing Mr SHERIDAN to think with the chairman in relation to POPE he produced  The Duenna  where there is not a single new situation from beginning to end The whole plot of turning the daughter out of doors and passing the maid for the mistress is conjointly the  Scicelienne  of MOLIERE and  Il Filosofo di campagna  where every circumstance is to be found from the serenade at the beginning to the marriage at the end The other plot is  The Wonder  which the moment it is told must be obvious to every bodybecause every body knows both pieces Not even any single subordinate circumstance is original  Father Paul  is MARMONTEL's  Philosophe soi disant  who as he eats delicacies talks of the roots of the earthand as he drinks burgundy praises the wholesome chrystal stream The dialogue is by no means brilliant but Mr SHERIDAN was determined it should penetrate every where and in particular the  aside  speeches of  Isaac  shewing beforehand how clearly he shall himself be taken in by his different attempts to deceive others is the most artful species of anticipation that ever was practised and shews a judgment of theatrical effect powerful new and extraordinary  The School for Scandal  is no more original than  The Duenna  The  school  itself is CONGREVE's  Cabal  and the play may fairly be called a sequel to  The Way of the World  The scandal has all been detailed in different pieces but principally in  The Plain Dealer  When in NOVEL  Lord Plausible Olivia  and  Eliza  will be found  Sir Benjamin Crab Lady Sneerwell  and  Mrs Candour  The brothers have been in a variety of things from  The Adelphi  to Mr CUMBERLAND's  Fashionable Folly  but the  Squire of Alsatia  on the stage and  Blifil  and  Tom Jones  in the closet are the closest resemblances The uncle lately returned from abroad and introduced to the drunken company is extremely like the  The Intriguing Chambermaid  The circumstance of the uncle's picture is in a French piece called  L'ecole de la Jeunesse  and  Joseph  and  Lady Teazle  are  Constant  and  Lady Brute  Mr SHERIDAN has said that there is not a new character or incidentand all that can be done is to take old matter and give it a novel appearance Had he said that it is safer to do so I would join with him for certainly when any thing comes in contact with the imagination that has been before familiar or rather congenial to it without consideration we give credit for its merit on the spot whatever we may do upon reflectionand having once praised a thing a false pride prevents us from discovering that we were deceived The dialogue of this piece is as accommodating as the rest of it Mr HERON points out the tinsel scattered up and down by way of sentiments which by the theatrical people are known by the name of  clap traps  and Mr SHERIDAN cannot take it amiss if in justice to his abilities and our own discernment one is obliged to say that he canwhenever he pleases write ten times better  The  Monody  which seems written expressly to desire all the world to  forget  GARRICK has again very little of originality in it LLOYD's  Actor  furnished the outline in addition to which Mr SHERIDAN certainly has touched in some beautiful strokes but after all it is but a sketch and much more likely to be forgotten than him whose memory it laboriously professes to prove ought to be buried with his ashes My great quarrel with Mr SHERIDAN in this business is that he has with great skill and ability spoken of all the arts except  music  He has shewn that the same of the statuary is most perfect when the statues themselves are broken to piecesthat RAPHAEL and SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS are cotemporaries  I once saw at Blenheimhouse what would make this line pass for satire It was a portrait of the DUCHESS OF MALBOROUGH and her CHILD in which the colours were all flown by the side of the VIRGIN and our SAVIOUR by RAPHAEL in which the tints were in as high preservation as if it had not been painted six months  and that these arts are subordinate to  poetry  but he has not once even hinted that there is any such study as musicto which I insist upon it none of the arts are superior I beg to ask Mr SHERIDAN a question Does he believe ifadded to his own consummate knowledge of stage effecthe could borrow the pen of SHAKESPEARE and by  blending such talents form a play beyond all conception the most perfect that ever graced a theatre that the audience would notspite of their anxious suspencespite of their bruised hides in crowding to the househiss down the curtain if they were deprived of the first music But indeed whatever may be the conscious haughtiness with which this gentleman may think proper to look down on an art to which I hope he owes no grudge he had good sense enough to court its alliance before he thought proper to put his  dramatic  fame to a  second  trial  The Critic  is surely nothing equal as a satire to  Tom Thumb  and when we talk of  The Rehearsal  it sinks to nothing FIELDING and BUCKINGHAM have taken in the whole round of tragedy and properly conceived that DRYDEN LEE and the old standards were fair game What has Mr SHERIDAN done Why truly except indeed where he chuses to ridicule SHAKESPEAREwhich by the bye I do not think an English audience would have suffered in any body elsehe has exposed the puerile modern stuff which if it be deficient in merit heas a managermust bear his share of reprehension for obtruding it on the public The business of  Sir Plagiary  is severe enough but unfortunately the very words he intends should give the deepest wound recoils on himselffor they are a  plagiary Puff  is full of pointed observation but that part of the piece is the first instanceas I before observedwhere an audience have quietly sat down and consented to be laughed at by an author As to the drift of the piece it appears to be written with a view alone to discourage writers of tragedy for there is no possible situation that can excite pity terror or any of those passions which it is the business of tragedy peculiarly to call forth but this work which  "professes to be critical"  attempts to laugh atand really not always with success for if figure and imagery may at all be introduced in this species of writing the criticism itself is more an object of ridicule than the thing it professes to criticise In short I defy Mr SHERIDAN himself to write a tragedy so as to steer clear of his own lash and how absurd must a man appear who provides a castigation for himself  The matter relative to the clock at the beginning of  The Duenna  shews evidently that he is vulnerable as well as his neighbours and as the circumstance goes to a reprobation of the unities it were as modest to propose some better criterion before he invited us to explode the admitted standard  "but one man may steal a horse better than another look over the hedge"  says the old proverb Mr SHERIDAN can write in any style and to any degree of perfection he pleases but his public writing like his public speaking is more  catching  than CAPTIVATING it  dazzles  but does not IMPRESSit  charms  but does not CONVINCE In short as that gentleman's aim is popularity he does every thing for the moment and it is a question after he has sunk into ease and independance from his natural indolence of mind whether he will ever again be known but by a few eminent trifles written to grace the private cabinet and make up the  delices  of the elegant and euridite  Mr SHERIDAN having most probably done with the stage as an author it is but fair to examine how far in that capacity he has been an acquisition to the public and when we consider that he has deprived the world of the best singer beyond all comparison that we have ever heard it is very doubtful whether what he has given be adequate to what he has taken awayand admitting this the public would rather have gained than lost had Mr SHERIDAN originally kept to politics and have had nothing to do with the theatre  This gentleman from his earliest youth resolved to be at the top of his profession be it what it might May his integrity equal his abilities and there is no situation but he will adorn  Adieu  Yours most perfectly C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXIV  MUSICAL JUSTICE  "  So ceas'd the rival crew when  PURCEL  came  "  They sung no more or only sung his fame  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  FINDING in LONDON the musical world up in arms at what they had heard concerning this book I cannot resume the subject better than by taking them while they are warm I am only sorry the small remaining portion of room which I can dedicate to this subject will prevent me from going into it so fully as I could wishfor it is prolific and cannot for the sake of the public be too closely inspected  I have advanced that PURCEL had a  stronger mind  than HANDEL and that had ARNE been encouraged he would have been a greater man At the time PURCEL lived music was in its infancy in this kingdom and all the perfection composers had an idea of was to shackle themselves with rules and thus they dared not give way to the brilliancy of their geniusfor there was as much good sense in this practise as there would be in tying a man's legs to make him run the fasterbut where in spite of dull custom the imagination of PURCEL beamed forth It had a majesty and a resulgence like the sun breaking from a cloud How beautiful is that heavenly bit  "I call you all to WODEN's hall"  What a bar or two will be found in  "Let not a moonborn elf"  Can any thing for exquisite simplicity and sweetness  exceed  "Lovely isle"  Nor will I go out of this very piece to prove my position relative to HANDEL  "Come if you dare the trumpet sounds"  gives me a fine opportunity to throw down my gauntlet and I challenge all the world to shew me any thing in music that can go beyond it HANDEL had a glorious opportunity had it been possible but in his attempt to excel it he has fallen to an immense distance indeed The words for both are written by DRYDEN and those which HANDEL set for grandeur has the preeminence one runs  "Comeif you darethe trumpet sounds  "Comeif you darethe foe rebounds  "We come we come we come  "Says the double double beat of the thundering drum"  I cannot correctly remember the remainderbut this will be enough for my purpose the other words are  "The trumpet's loud clangour  "Excites us to arms  "With shrill notes of anger  "And mortal alarms  "The double double double beat  "Of the thund'ring drum  "Cries hark the foes come  "Charge charge 'tis too late to retreat"  PURCEL's expression is one great soulfelt effusion of simple sublimity and as it ever will be the case with great minds at the same time that these few bold notes carry us to the rough manners of the court of King ARTHUR there is a natural ease and irresistable grace in them that will vainly be imitated by all the studied polish of the Italian school and indeed so strongly from genius did PURCEL possess that symmetry in fancy whichlike the native dignity of some formscannot in any position be ungraceful that the very error Dr BURNEY reprobates in HANDELwhich he qualifies by the bye saying that it was not reformed till  lately  is here in PURCEL who lived in ruder  times better than  corrected  it is  avoided  for his great conceptionwhile others  labour  to improve  nature  into  ease  derived  ease  from  nature  What I allude to is the accommodating the melody of the capacity of the trumpetswhich HANDEL scarcely ever doesand surely there is something like barrenness of invention in this But to examine what HANDEL has done with the other wordsand here I am afraid integrity obliges us to say he has servilely imitated PURCEL I say servilely because the time and the construction is the same butlike a clumsy translationthe literal intention is barely preserved and all the beauty and correctness left out Indeed the curious mode of accenting the beginning of every barfor it runs thus  "The  trumpets  loud  clangour excites  us to  arms  "  the  lovely  introduction of the  fourth  for the trumpet and the lameness of the double beat of  the  thundering drumthough thundering happens to be of three syllables and thus there can be no excuse for itshews that though HANDEL came  after  PURCELwhich is admitted to be an advantageit was in such a  hobbling  kind of way and he was at such a distance that he never was able to come up to him The words  "Charge 'tis too late to retreat"  though they are materially hurt by the continuation of that bastard kind of minuet which accompanies them throughout have much of HANDEL's natural grandeur which certainly characterized him wherever he is helped out by instruments but which seems perpetually to forsake him when the  voice  should convey the MIND  PURCELthough probably very unconscious that he had successfully challenged all the world to excel himfollows up  "Comeif you dare"  with  "To arms"  which harmony HANDEL has twenty times played upon and  "Britons strike home"  and if any man will shew me a superior selection from any one piece composed by HANDELas no man is more open to convictionI will confess that PURCEL and I are conquered  ALEXANDER is said to have emulated ACHILLES and CHARLES XII ALEXANDER It has also been remarked that SPENCER had only the  ANCIENTS to consultDRYDEN the ANCIENTS and SPENCERand POPE all theseand that we may by deduction pronounce that SPENCER was the greatest  poet  DRYDEN the  next  and POPE the  most inferior  It is certain whatever DRYDEN and POPE have come in contactwitness for example the  Ode on St Cecilia's day  and  Alexander's feast  POPE has constantly been worsted and probably all the fancy in DRYDEN's works together bear no proportion to the wonderful imagery in the teeming imagination of SPENCER let me therefore be allowed when I speak of PURCEL the time in which he lived the little information he could have gathered from what went before him and the many discouragements he laboured under and I am not afraid but every man who has the candour to take up my arguments upon this liberal ground will allow me that this wonderful composer had a  stronger mind  than HANDEL  My next task will be to prove my position in relation to ARNE and this I shall endeavour to do in my next letter In the mean time I cannot either introduce  that  or finish  this  better than by remarking that when ARNE came to alter the music of King ARTHUR for  Drurylane  with that good sense and philanthropy of which no man possessed a larger sharethough he introduced some charming thingsso far from mutilating PURCEL as a modern compiler would have done with proper reverence for such great abilities his whole study was to place his idolized predecessor in that conspicuous situation the brilliancy of his reputation demanded for ARNEand I well know ithad as much of the harmony of  humanity  as of  sounds  His latter excellence I am now going to examine Give me however an agreeable relaxation by suffering me once more to repeat that I am  Yours most heartily C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXV  MORE MATTER OF THE SAME COMPLEXION  "  Till the rapt soul earth forsaking  "  Heavenward its flight is taking  "  On the wings of harmony  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  IF any of the lovers of HANDEL were to open this book exactly at this page they would think it was written in  Bedlam  and immediately pitying the poor maniac of an author shrug up their shoulders and lay it down As to their opinions whose minds are shut against conviction I am perfectly indifferentbut I will not let them pass without remarking that those who admire one man of genius to the exclusion of all others must naturally possess such narrow contracted sentiments that their very blandishments are tainted with poison and destroy that reputation they profess to cherish  I start ARNE against HANDEL by saying that HANDEL has not produced a piece so complete from first to last as  Comus  As a man of  genius  by infinite degrees  Acis and Galatea  is HANDEL's best work and I will venture to say but for that piece he could not have borne that great rank notwithstanding all that has been vaunted of the  Messiah  among men who know  really  how to distinguish  Acis and Galatea  contains a number of beautiful melodies and what lists it into great consequence is that the subject is every  where  pastoral  and yet HANDEL has contrived without injuring it to make it every where  different  Even  Polypheme  and the  octave flute  are  consistently  coupled together The famous trio  "The flocks shall leave the mountains"  is a composition replete with sweetness and expression and  "Wretched lovers"  is an astonishing chorus  "Hush ye pretty warbling quire"  and  "Love in her eyes"  are delicately pretty though if there were not so great a maze of modulation in the latter it would be more pleasing In short there is prodigious merit in  Acis and Galatea  and yet I am not afraid but ARNE can stand fairly up to his competitor I would not wish to match my HERO with a  pigmy  Comus  has one character as well as  Acis and Galatea  and the  bacchanalian revels  of ARNE is every where  equal  to the  pastoral simplicity  of HANDEL and in many places SUPERIOR ARNE has diversified his subjects and in a very peculiar way given them a  masculine  and a  feminine  colouring Among the first are  "When Phoebus sinketh in the west"  "By the gaily circling glass"  "Fly swiftly ye minutes"  and several others and amongst the latter  "By dimpled brook"  "Would you taste the noontide air"  "Come bid adieu to fear"  and many more Nay he has contrived to  blend  this colouring in  "Live and love enjoy the fair"  which is a most happy composition indeed and fairly equal in its kind to  "The flocks shall leave the mountains"  All these songs are full of rich and pleasing melody and in them there is not a superfluous note There ARNE takes the lead of HANDELbecause music does not want alone fancy to  conceive  but judgment to  complete  it and in many of the songs of  Acis and Galatea  "Shepherd what art thou pursuing"  "Consider fond shepherd"  "Cease to beauty"  and some others the subject is  worked  on till the ear can bear it no longer and the composer seeming to be aware of this lassitude takes his advantage of it and comes any how to a close while the stupor prevails that so the hearer may not with precision judge of his desects  So far  Comus  is at least upon a par with  Acis and Galatea  and when we call in  "Nor on beds"  that heavenly melody so greatly conceived so delicately pursued and so exquisitely finished  "On every hill"  which is a species of pastoral music peculiar to ARNE and being in a minor key and consequently of a more primitive nature especially as its simplicity appeals wonderfully to the heart may be said to be superior to any other  "Sweet echo"  which  "takes the rapt soul and laps it in elysium"  and many of inferior kind such as that pretty song  "By the rushy fringed bank"  there can be no doubt but  Comus  is a greater effort of genius than  Acis and Galatea  But there are more complete pieces to assist this argument  Artaxerxes  is a most powerful performancethere the  hearer  may be gratified with every style of serious music and yet the whole is managed with such judgmentwhich outgoes Mr SHERIDANthat though perfectly in nature the  stage boxes  are not more satisfied than the  upper galleries  If we search further we shall find  Judith  an oratorio that does honour to English geniuswhere we may see sacred ideas without burlesque accompanimentssweet air and forcible expressioncapital songs perfectly  vocal  and astonishingly brilliant  chorusses  without a  fugue  If we have still to shewfor I would willingly satisfy every bodywhether ARNE knew music  scientifically  I'll beg leave to instance the chorusses in  Abel  which it must be admitted explore the regions of harmony with a latitude as bold and as masterly as any thing in music And now I think if ARNE had been equally patronized with HANDEL if he had not been obliged to humour managers to consult the caprice of actors and actresses to witness the arrogance of Italians whose base metal became a fashion while his sterling coin was disregarded to do jobs for now and then twenty guineas and dance attendance at catch clubs to make up an annual benefit he would have had better reason to think himself properly encouraged and perhaps been stimulated  to the accomplishment of various other works for which his exalted genius so eminently qualified him This alone has made him apparently inferior to HANDEL and this induced him to keep within the limits of his mediocre situation contenting himself by the exercise of his own cheerful and even temper with that precarious pittance which is too often allotted to real merit in this country  Certainly ARNE's faults were  few  HANDEL's  innumerable  and when we consider that HANDEL composed when he was in the humour and to please  himself  ARNE when he could get a job and to please his  employer  that HANDEL was rich and ARNE was poorour wonder ought rather to be that he left so many and such admirable compositions behind him But DRYDEN is said to have been prevented from writing an epic poem by his engagement with the theatres which obliged him to write four plays in a year and thus are we constantly deprived of the best efforts of English genius by lavishing that on foreignerswho laugh at uswhich is so honourably due to our own countrymen  My next letter will speak of teachingwhich will be all I shall have occasion to say  generally  of music I am charmed that I have opened your eyes relative to Mr SHERIDAN ARNE is a favourite of yours and therefore this last task has not been so hard I hope you believe me just to every body is I were not so I should not deserve the pleasure with which I subscribe myself  Yours Most faithfully C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXVI  MORE QUACKERY  "  Reform it altogether  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  A Shall now speak of that mystery by which so many young ladies at a great expence in the course of seven years attain the supreme felicity of exposing themselves by playing MALBROOK out of tune and hammering out unmeaning progressive lessons by which the taste of whole families is vitiated through the ignorance of mere strummers and octave players through which the foundation of genius is sapped and destroyed and through which pretenders to a liberal professionmere  quacks  are lifted into consequence and permitted to vilify and  traduce  those productions they have not the taste and judgment to  understand  A  teacher  nurses a  scholar  as an  apothecary  does a  patient  and a  slow sever  and a  dunce  are much about upon a par it is not the intention that one should  recover  or the other  improve  the business is to keep them in hand as long as possible and if a  robust constitution  in one and  strong intellects  in the other manifest signs of  health  or  merit  'tis wonderful to what shifts the poor devils are putto curb  nature  in order to swell out the bill  Good teacherslike good lawyersare very scarce Those who are really good ones will first of all inculcate the principles of music to a certain degree prove those principles in every possible manner and strongly root their efficacy in the scholar's mindand nothing in nature to men of real ingenuity is easier than this  Bad  teachers swarm all over the kingdom and their practice is to their scholars immediately to the instrument to explain nothing but as it occurs to make a mystery of every thing and at lengthsome wilfully and others out of ignoranceto confirm in their scholars so many bad habits and perplexities that they are further from the real mark when they leave off than when they began  A third sort of teacherswho are certainly bad ones too but not so mischievousare those who go about every thing scientifically and teach  thorough bass fugue and counterpoint  instead of  Foot's minuet  One of these had taken a young lady in hand and taught her in the course of three quarters of a year every possible situation of the sixth and fourth and common chord Dr MILLER and  I  had a laugh about this for we calculated that taking in all the concords and discords with their proper and inverted relations this young lady might entertain lively hopes in the course of two and thirty years and a half of accompanying a concerto  Both sorts of  bad  teachers do equal mischieffor those who wilfully impose on parents decry the works of genius  out of envy  as much as the other description  out of ignorance  and the consequent evils are the loss of time and expence and the introduction of bad taste From this last abuse springs half the musical folly for which this country is so celebrated which like Vesuvius is frequently breaking out bearing down taste genius and every cultivated object in its way for whether a human voice an octave above a  blackbirda Frenchhorn that plays every thing but what is natural to ita fugue or an Irish jiga double drum or a bagpipebe the object this monster this devourer rages like the  Minotaur  and taste is the bleeding sacrifice devoted to appease his ravages Alas that some musical Theseus would but destroy this pest and rid our country of its barbarism But a clue to the labyrinth where it is concealed will hardly be found while there are so many to participate the golden fleece  There is no coming to the end of this subject especially circumscribed as I am I can therefore only say in addition to the above remarks that a practical knowledge of music as far as it can be necessary for common purposes is very easily attained for it consists of nothing more than learning the gamutthe names lengths divisions and measure of the notesdistinctions of all the major and minor keysthe situations of the semitones and the doctrine of using the sharp seventh to modulate into the fifth of the key and the flat seventh to return to the original key These with all colateral matters are nothing like so difficult as the first four rules of arithmetic with the fractions relative to them and yet upon the same principle that Addition Subtraction Multiplication and Division comprehend the whole study of figures so do these rules in music comprehend the whole system of harmony and all there is more to be done is to blend separate diversify and in short use them in every possible point of view Let not a scholar then learn more than this let it be learnt perfect and then put in practicewhich done it is a thousand to oneif there is any genius to assist studybut the whole science will lay clearly open to viewif it should not by the union of what has been learnt it may be easily attained and it would be as absurd to teach music upon any other plan as to set a sum in the  Rule of three  for a scholar who had not learnt his Numeration Table  With all this great care must be used in the choice of a master and as to teachers decrying good music and introducing false taste I see no cure for  this but my former rule which islet no man subscribe to the  goodness  of any music that is not  pleasing  It would be good indeed if it were as pleasing as the sensation I feel when I repeat to you that I am  Very heartily Yours C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXVII  A FINAL ACCOUNT OF PLACES  "  Such marches and countermarches  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  AS a dramatic writer collects all his matter together at the beginning of the last act in order to introduce his  Coup de Theatre  which as it may suit him either leads to or finishes the catastrophe so shall I immediately carry into one general account all the remains of places inns and other subordinate matter in order to introduce such a  Coup de Theatre  as shall command applause at the fall of the curtain  I have mentioned already the opulence and populousness of LEEDS and shall take my final leave of the inhabitants as a spirited manly and enlightened people who have the industry to get money and the liberality to spend it It has two very large clothhalls and the assemblyroom is by far the handsomest I saw in my tour for a single room  HALIFAX is an astonishing trading town for its size I saw the clothhall on a market day and it gave me an idea of a beehive the prodigious number of cells and the porters coming in and out with their bundles of cloth were exactly the loaded bees The parish contains twelve chapels of ease and is said to be worth about twelve hundred a year  MANCHESTER is a charming town and I have seen nothing superior to  Moselystreet  but  Portlandsquare  The number of people on a market day is astonishing and the entrance into the town from STOCKPORTwhich is to MANCHESTER what WOLVERHAMPTON is to BIRMINGHAMis very magnificent The choir in the Collegiate church is beautiful and the progress of the manufactories and in particular the cutting fustians and passing even the finest muslins over a red hot iron are matters astonishingly curious and which if time permitted I should have great pleasure in dwelling on  LIVERPOOL is beyond all question the first town in the kingdom after LONDON its capacious docks its roomy storehouses its entensive and wellfilled harbour the prodigious plenty in its markets particularly of cornits spacious squares its magnificent public buildings of which the Change is a most capital oneits churches and indeed all that great variety of edifices for duty business and pleasure to which by act of parliament they are now making considerable additions abundantly prove the truth of this assertion I did not see the theatre at MANCHESTER but that at LIVERPOOL which is altering upon an admirable plan under the direction of Mr TAYLOR is spacious convenient and handsome I counted in the directory nearly an hundred streets and this circumstance obliges me again to speak disadvantageously of MANCHESTER which place has unlike LIVERPOOL neither  directory  nor  hackney coaches  DURHAM in summer must be one of the most beautiful situations in ENGLAND The river the castle the cathedral the bishop's palace and the straggling suburbs present you with a new and picturesque view wherever you turn It is remarkable for a good choir of singers indeed the salaries are higher here than any where and in consequencefor encouragement wonderfully nurtures geniusour concerts have been well stocked from thence The more genteel part of the inhabitants are more a community than a neighbourhood a family than a society  NEWCASTLE is ancient and romantic and the inhabitants seem to relish of both They give you an idea of a man who piques himself on his birth and extraction though his mansion is mouldering and his estate falling to decay I do not mean to say that NEWCASTLE is not richit is remarkably so and I am informed hospitable However there must be a manner with meit is not the size of the dish but the style in which it is dressed not the number of eatables but the mode of their being put on the table and after all it is not the wine but the conversation that accompanies it NEWCASTLE seems to have very little taste There is a new and remarkably handsome  theatre  which is a hobbyhorse at present and will in all probability be thrown away next year for some other bawble In shortfor I am always obliged to have recourse to LIVERPOOL when I would make an advantageous comparisonNEWCASTLE is proud LIVERPOOL industriousNEWCASTLE is near LIVERPOOL liberaland one may pretty well conclude that if they did not dig their riches out of the bowels of the earth and unload them in the river Thames they would not count on their riches for they would never have the spirit and courage to adventure for them with any degree of intrepidity to the farthest corner of the world The road from YORK to DARLINGTON is beautiful It is a heavy stage from DARLINGTON to DURHAM and on account of the hills still heavier from DURHAM to NEWCASTLE  For the inns I must go back again to BIRMINGHAM where there are several good ones but all immoderately dear At LICHFIELD which is in the public road from LONDON to LIVERPOOL they are pretty good and tolerably reasonable At DERBY much better for accommodations but much the same as to their charge At NOTTINGHAM the  Blackamoor's Head  is an inn where travellers will be shewn every civility get good entertainment and accommodation and upon moderate terms I have spoken of NEWARKAt LINCOLN I would recommend the  Spread Eagle  which is a decent civil house and reasonable At BARTON where it may sometimes happen that  you are obliged to stay several hours and where you generally arrive wet from HULL there is but one miserable inn the smallest accommodation or any thing decent by way of eating and drinking BAKER's at HULL is a very good innand so is the  Tyger  at BEVERLY At YORK and every where in the north road there are good inns but in general very dearthe  Angel  at DONCASTER in particular At LEEDS there is not a real good inn in the town At HALIFAX they are not remarkable for appearance but they are for decent neatness and good eatables and drinkables and the lowest charges any where in Yorkshire At WAKEFIELD the  Stratford Arms  is a very good inn and they pay you attention and charge pretty reasonable At MANCHESTER there is not a single good inn and the treatment is insolent beyond descriptionat least where I have been Only see the gradationat HALIFAX I paid  four  shillings for the same tea supper and breakfast which at DONCASTER cost me  nine  and at MANCHESTER  thirteen  but this last was at the  Hotel  which exactly gives you the idea of a bagnio in LONDONThis  Hotel  belongs to the man who keeps the  Bull's Head  at which house I had a room and an indifferent one for the performance yet were my friends under a necessity of asking it as a sort of favour though the man was handsomely paid and the accommodations were very contemptible indeed As to DIXON at the  Swan  the last time I was at MANCHESTER I was from seven o'clock in the morning till eleven getting away in a postchaise and during that time having a letter to seal and a parcel to tie up afterin the course of an hour and a halfintreating the favour of a wafer and a bit of pack thread I was at length obliged to go to a shop to buy it and the man told me he did not wonder at it for it was a remark that the innkeepers of MANCHESTER spit in people's faces in return for their favours As far as my experience goes this usage extends also to lodginghouses Every body knows where I lodged at MANCHESTER and I paid there for board and lodging full  four times  as much as I was charged at LIVERPOOL for  better living  I did not think when I was most shamefully imposed upon in FRANCE I should have an opportunity of celebrating a more scandalous piece of knavery in ENGLAND At NANCY in LORRAINE I lodged in the house of a Mr VILLEMETTE and having experienced a few of their tricks I had previously determined to be on my guard I paid him at the end of every week and took his receipt When I came to a final settlement he gave me the week's receipt as usual but begged I would settle the remainder I asked what he meant for that I had paid him every thing He said it was true that I had paid him every thing supposing our agreement to have been in money of LORRAINE but that it had been in money of FRANCE and reckoning the difference of the currency I was then in his debt just thireen guineas I answered that fortunately I knew so much of their laws as to be well convinced that all bargains were good only for money of LORRAINE unless made before two witnesses this he said he had taken care of and immediately produced the witnesses whom I had never seen before I saw I was to be tricked and asked them if they would go before the general of the police and swear it VOLUNTIER MONSIEUR was the answer I put them to the test and they swallowed the oath with all the calmness imaginable I asked the general of the police what he thought of the business he said he knew them all to be infamous scoundrels that it was a pity I could not stay to do myself justice but if I would leave ten guineas in his hand he had no doubt but he should give me a good account of the  siness I however contented myself with my first loss and went away without even thanking the general of the police for his politenessThe imposition at MANCHESTER was proportionably more shameful than this  The inns  at LIVERPOOL are pretty rich and therefore of course pretty consequential Master FORSHAR in particular whose room I had has a good deal of consequence but he has an idea of respect and would be the first to reprove his waiters for the smallest incivility to strangers As to their charges the diligence took me to the  Cross Keys  where I was very comfortable for a day or two upon very reasonable terms The roads in Lancashire are in general very sandy and bad but this is sometimes remedied by paving them and in great part of Yorkshire there is a stone causeway which is a very agreeable recommendation to foot passengers  Leaving all these and ceasing at once to be a public character I arrived in TOWN as I told you where the first news that I heard was that GRIMALDI that incendiary by whom was bred so much of my public uneasiness that viper who bit me because I fostered him was no more Perhaps it is a good omenand having completed my resolution of quitting all theatrical pursuits in which it is plain I could not hope for prosperity the malignant fiend has ceased his detestable influence He has not living left his  equalfor if fifty ABURNOTS were to lend their assistance they could not write an epitaph expressive of him whose corrupt heart harboured more vice than could reside in the soul of fifty CHARTERISES  I could not refrain from writing a few lines on the death of this monster and I was induced to do it by being informed that just before he died he said the devil was waiting for him and that he knew he was going to hell and yet had the wretch an idea of being spoken of after his death He said  "Oh I go the Devil and if any body write 'bout me let them finitchalas poor Grim"  EPITAPH  GRIMALDI's gonewere we to say at rest  'Twere to make truth what he was wonta jest  Internally convuls'd AETNA will roar  And stormswell'd seas lash the affrighted shore  So conscience struckspent his pestiferous breath  Yet shall he fear "that something after death"  He's gonenor more on holy rites can trample  "To guilty minds a terrible example"  Fiends as they catch him tear him limb from limb  'Till e'en the devil cries  alas poor Grim  See how my plot winds up The monster is dead that obstructed my former fortunein my next I shall introduce the guardian spirit whose benign goodness has sent me smiling hope to protect my fortune in future  Adieu  Yours Most faithfully C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXVIII  THE COUP DE THEATRE  "  A combination and a form indeed  "  Where every god did seem to set his seal  "  To give the world assurance of a man  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  IT had long been my ambition to bring out this work under the protection of the PRINCE OF WALES For this purpose I solicited the kindest and most generous friend I have who frequently has the honour of being where his ROYAL HIGHNESS visits to do what he could with propriety to procure me this high and flattering advantage Indefatigable to oblige and serve me he did not let the matter rest a single moment but watching the first opportunity to mention it with proper decorum the PRINCE with all that amiable affability which ever distinguishes the truly noble condescendingly signified a wish to see me  By his ROYAL HIGHNESS's gracious appointment I had the great honour at the house of a gentleman where my kind friend is very intimate of playing and singing in his presence those songs with whichnot less as a correct and perfect judge of music than of nature expression and discriminationI thought he was most likely to be entertained and though I did not perform fewer than twenty I had the singular satisfaction to find I did nothing but what received perfect approbation nor for nearly two hours did the time seem to weareven tho'  MARCHESI had during the interval made his first appearance  The PRINCE did not get to the  Opera  till twenty minutes before  ten o'clock  at the  Opera  and vainly looked round for this illustrious auditor who at that moment was perhaps paying the tribute of a sigh to the memory of poor JACK RATLIN or regretting the unhappy fate of the worn out race horse  I must take the liberty to mention that his ROYAL HIGHNESS upon my singing the  Race Horse  informed the company that he had fortunately about a fortnight before rescued a poor old half blind race horse from the galling shafts of a hakney postchaise  "Why 'twas a princely act"  My friend took an opportunity before the PRINCE retired to request the honour of his name to my subscription to which his ROYAL HIGHNESS thought proper to answer  "I might use his name in any way that I thought would be of service to me"  No terms can convey a panegyric adequate to this noble condescension what could induce it but that true greatness of mind which as PORTIA says of mercy  "becomes the throned monarch better than his crown"  But the genial sun cherishes not more the  spreading  ROSE than the  humble  VIOLET  Having this honourable and flattering  Carte blanche  my first wish I own was a  dedication  but upon considering how many of these sort of addresses teem with such ridiculous hyperbole and fulsome adulation as would make one think they attempted to  satyrize  that PATRONAGE they professed to  solicit  though never did opportunity occur where flattery was so impossibleI thought an  inscription  for what with such a name is not an advantagewould be most adviseable and I could then give a latitude to those  feelings  in a letter to you which addressed to the ROYAL PERSONAGE from whose bounty I have the happiness to derive them could not without wounding respect have been dressed in terms forcible enough for the purpose nor indeed with this scope do I flatter myself with perfect successfor the real language of a susceptible heart never yet found its way to the pen  Yet I cannot finish without a word or two more on this generous subject In this TOUR will be found many noble and illustrious persons with whom I have had the honour to converse I have in that warmth which truth alone inspired spoken of these in terms of praise and I do not upon recollection repent of any syllable to this effect I have seen courtly breeding in FRANCEI have ever made it my particular felicity to notice the talents of ingenious menbut I confidently declare that all I have witnessed sinks into nothing before the object of my present panegyric In deportment never was there such an union of  ease grace  and  dignity  as in the PRINCE OF WALES His manners are  gentle mild  and  affable  or as SHAKESPEARE has it  "sweet as summer"  and yet always PRINCELYHis observations are  keen  and  penetrating  his intellectual intelligence  strong diffusive  and  refined  his information  select  and  judicious  in short that beautiful picture in which HAMLET paints the mental as well as the personal perfections of his father never called for application so strongly as in the present instance for if ever  countenance form manner  and  understanding  are to be relied on those of this ILLUSTRIOUS YOUTH clearly point him out as the  protector benefactor  and FRIEND of MANKIND  But I must force myself from this indulgent employment lest  that  should become  disrespect  which ought to be  humility  for who can trust the effusions of a HEAD full of  praise  and a HEART full of  gratitude  With these auspicious feelings I finish my TOUR and beg you to believe that I am now as ever  Very truly Yours C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXIX  STATEMENT OF PIECES  "  And then Nab has no head  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I shall now as faithfully as my memory will permit me proceed to state the success both in profit and reputation of every piece I have produced to the public I am afraid however I shall not be very accurate in my account of the more subordinate kind for were I to be put to the torture I could not enumerate some of the interludes and pantomimes which have been done at  Sadler's Wells  and some other places nor can I place those I do recollect in accurate order as to their dates I shall however be as correct as possible and where my intelligence is uncertain I will myself sustain the loss rather than fill up the blank by exaggeration    The Shepherd's Artifice  performed in May and This piece which I wrote and composed at  seventeen  was only got up for my own benefit It has a thousand faults and in particular as at that time I did not know how to put my musical thoughts upon paper but by mere strength of imagination 'tis impossible to describe the number of its inaccuracies These however the same force of fancy enabled me to correct and without any assistance I produced the same piece in a perfect state by only listening to the faults as I heard them in the band It was performed at two of my benefits  and each time brought a tolerable housebut it never came forward in the common business of the  theatre  The music was very much applauded  It will not here be improper to remark that I never learnt more of music than the gamut and the table which points out the division of the time Mr FUSSEL the organist of WINCHESTER cathedral I am told says I owe my musical education to himwhich assertion contains so much truth that five or six very common tunes which I now have in his hand writing are all I ever was taught Mr KENT had afterwards the credit of having taught mebut except some anthems which he composed for me and which I learnt by ear I never received the smallest instruction from him The music I have was strongly in my mind from my earliest remembrance and I do not think any master would have been of the smallest service to me It lay quietly a hidden sparkwhich in the country found nothing to vivify itbut coming in contact with that proper fuel for it the different musical performances in town it at once expanded and nothing could keep it within bounds I scarcely knew this myself till being present at a rehearsal of  Thomas and Sally  all that past so tenaciously adhered to my memory that I went home drew out a score and after attending another rehearsal filled up the accompanyments It was certainly incorrectbut for such an effort in a very trifling degree for I was not then sixteen I found however I was in the secret and immediately took the concertos of CORRELLI in single parts and put them into score Here I went upon good authority through every turning and twining in the labyrinth of harmony I next got hold of RAMEAU and having proved theoretically by one and practically by the other the difference between passing and emphatic notesthe nature of supposed bassesand found by a fair trial of these matters in every point of view that two chords comprehend the whole system of harmony I determined fearlessly to give a loose to my fancyto what purpose is pretty well known    Love in the City  performed in the year a piece written by Mr BICKERSTAFF and performed but six nights In this I composed the  overture  the  firste horus  the  finales  of the  first  and  second acts  and three songs  Love in the City  has since been altered into the farce of the  Romp  in which the  chorus  the  quintetto  the  boxing trio  and  "Dear me how I long to be married"  are mine  I cannot here omit an anecdote which tells greatly to the honour of Dr ARNE SIMPSON the hautboy player and some others persuaded Mr BEARD t at my music would do his theatre discredit and that in particular the overture and a song beginning  "Ah why my dear"  were written entirely against the  rules of harmony  This Mr BEARDwho had more goodnature than any other quality in the worldwas easily brought to believe Hearing what was going forward I took the copy of the overture and song and prevailed on honest TOMMY BAKERwhom all the world knowsto accompany me waited on Dr ARNE The Doctor after looking carefully over the scores said there was nothing against the rules of harmony that it was a pity Mr SIMPSON would not stick to his hautboy without pretending to judge of what he was not at all acquainted with and that if I would privately inform him when there was to be another rehearsal he would himself attend This I sailed not to doand finding those pieces altered by some other person the Doctor begged to hear the original copies These were produced and played over when he pronounced the whole business a scandalous attempt to injure the reputation of a young man whom if they had had any liberality it would have been their duty to encourage In consequence of the Doctor's decision my music was restored and performed with success  This music I made Mr BICKERSTAFF a present of    Lionel and Clarissa  written by Mr BICKERSTAFF and performed in the season of and By looking at the index it will be seen that from first to last I composed for this piece about twentyfive things for which trouble I received at different times fortyeight poundsgiving up the copyright The sale of this music did not yield much till it came out under the title of  The School for Fathers  otherwise I think I should not have been so completely overreached in the following agreement    The Padlock  written by Mr BICKERSTAFF and performed at  DruryLane  in October The success of this piece is pretty well known all over the kingdom it may not however be amiss to mention that no conception can be formed of the sale of the music  Comus  is known to have sold very extensively but after upwards of thirty years three fourths of the original plates are still in use What then will be said when I assure the public the  Padlock  had  seven  years ago nearly worn out three entire sets But how will their wonder be augmented when I declare upon the faith of a man that I never received in the whole for composing that music but fortyfive pounds though I dare say the sale of the music alone yielded Mr BICKERSTAFF nearly five hundred pounds In addition to this his benefit yielded two hundred pounds Mr GARRICK made him a present of one hundred pounds  It has been some times a private compact from  managers  to  authors  to give an extra benefit on the twentieth night of a piece Mr RICH introduced this custom in a very handsome way On the twentieth performance of  Miss in her Teens  GARRICK when he received the bills in the morning found the farce advertised without any previous notice for the benefit of its author which was himself In the instance of the  Padlock  he gave Mr BICKERSTAFF his choice of an extra benefit or an hundred pounds  and the words must have also been greatly productive for he  kept the copyrightand twelve years ago there had been upwards of twenty three thousand copies sold My agreement however was made before the piece came out and I conceived his recommendation of me to Mr GARRICK in the light of a great obligation whereas had I not been the stupidest of all idiots I might have seen that my being pinned to  DruryLane  upon such  easy terms  was a matter concerted between them I hate to think of ittherefore let me pause and bring myself into temper by assuring you that I am  Ever yours C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXX  THE STATEMENT PURSUED  "  But to whom am I to make out my bill  "  Doubtless to the vestry  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  PLEASE to go on with me    The Maid the Mistress  performed in the summer of at  Ranelagh  and written by Mr BICKERSTAFF Having made an agreement that season to compose for  Ranelagh  and occasionally sing for which trouble I was to have an hundred guineas this piece comes within that article and the music has never yet been published    The Recruiting Serjeant  performed the same season on the same terms I published the music on my own account and found it unsuccessful    The Jubilee  written by Mr GARRICK and performed in October It would be an endless task to go through the variety of circumstances which distinguish this memorable business but nothing deserves notice more truly than that SHAKESPEAR might have laid very quietly in STRATFORD churchnobody would have disturbed his asheshad not such a popular measure been the probable means of insuring a plentiful harvest to  DruryLane  on the following season And yet it was  managed  with so much caution so much wariness that according to the representation of the matter to every body who was concerned in it there did not appear any such thing in agitation This cautiousness answered two purposesit not only drew many to STRATFORD who would otherwise have suspended their curiosity till they should see it in LONDON but it served as a feasible excuse for requesting every body's trouble and attendance for nothing Thus among the rest I took unwearied painsnot seeing that I should materially assist in filling the coffers of  DruryLane  treasurywithout any emolument to myself All this however I could have forgiven if I had not been obliged to sustain fifty humiliations I will venture to say that had it not been for  my  music the audience would have shewn much more dissatisfaction They were not in very good humour as it was They heard certainly Dr ARNE's beautiful Oratorio of  Judith  and his charming music of the Odeand what was the most exquisite and inexpressible treat that ever transcendent abilities could convey or longing ears experience they heard GARRICK repeat that Ode Yet being disappointed of the Pageantbeing wet through at the Masquerade  The booth being built on a swamp close to the river and nobody having considered that sometimes in the month of September it rains the company had scarcely assembled when the wet began to ooze through the crevices in five minutes after they were paddling in the wet five minutes after that it was over their shoes and presently they were obliged to take to the benches then to the orchestra and then to the windowsthus there was not a creature out of about four hundred people that escaped being wet through  they were certainly very much discontented which dissatisfaction would more than silently have manifested itself had not  "The Warwickshire Lads c"  brought them into good humouryet was that very song privately set by Mr AYLWARD and the  "Mulberry Tree"  by Dr BOYCE and had not my kind friend Mr GARRICK been told at a rehearsal where I was  not present  that mine were set the best for effect he would have waved all delicacy to me and have had theirs performed GEORGE GARRICK who where DAVID's immediate interest did not clash could be just to all the world informed me  of this fact  GEORGE GARRICK who I have said before was warmly attached to his brother was remarkably attentive to all his little whims and caprices upon this great occasion Indeed he had so many admirable traits of real goodness that it is no wonder partly from gratitude partly from the amiable worthiness of his heart he should consider DAVID as a being who had a right to exact an extraordinary degree of attention from every body but particularly from him The other who never failed to encourage adulation wherever he found it improved the influence he had over GEORGE till he brought it to something so very like meanness that it could not be palliated but by the real motives to which I have ascribed it In consequence of this slavish attention GEORGE was always in anxiety lest in his absence his brother should have wanted him and the first question he constantly asked on his return was  "Did DAVID want me"  GEORGE GARRICK died about three months after his brother which circumstance being mentioned in the greenroom and marked as something extraordinary  "Extraordinary"  aid BANNISTER  "not at allDAVID  wanted him  "  In short GARRICK in relation to the  Jubilee  manoeuvred every where and with every body He procured abuse to be inserted in the papers which he got all his friends to answer He enlisted a prodigious number of volunteers whose exertions he pretty liberally extracted at their expence and at length performed the same entertainment ninetyfive times in one season at  DruryLane  which he sent people an hundred miles  not  to see The music of the  Jubilee  having sold it previous to the performance at STRATFORDexcept some trifling part of ityielded altogether about fortythree pounds    Damon and Phillida  the same season This piece I was desired by Mr GARRICK to alter and new set I was told that there was no settled price for such a job but I might make out a bill I conceived this a good opportunity to make me amends for the trouble I had with the  Jubilee  and did it cheerfully The piece was not often performed but before the time arrived to talk of settling for it Mr GARRICK proposed to enter into an article for seven years at six pounds a week for the three first years and seven pounds for the other four and in making the agreement he contrivedor LACY instructed by him as I mentioned beforeto include every thing that was yet unaccounted for so  Damon and Phillida  went for nothing except fifteen pounds for which I sold the copyright of the music    The Ephesian Matron  written by Mr BICKERSTAFF The same article went over to a second season at  Ranelagh  where this piece was performed and under this article I composed it The publication of this music was sold on some eventual agreement and I think yielded me only a few poundsbut I cannot at this moment say what This piece was performed about thirty times    The Brickdustman  a little musical piece performed at  Sadler's Wells  written by Mr BICKERSTAFF This trifle had great success and introduced an engagement which I entered into with Mr KING which though no great matter as to emolument was as good as  Sadlers Wells  could afford and one of the pleasantest I ever made Indeed I am happy to have this opportunity of acknowledging my great regard and respect for this gentleman which I hold from principle and the result of many years experience of his manly liberal and uniform conduct and he must forgive me if feeling thus I here make a public acknowledgment of the letter I received from him at MANCHESTER wherein he subscribed to this book and gave as a reason that  "he should be sorry to be left out of the list of my wellwishers"  This friendship dear sir is of the complexion of yoursfor which give me leave to say  I remain your kind friend And obliged humble servant C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXXI  FURTHER STATEMENT  "  Why he deals them by the score  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  WE now return to  Drurylane    The Pigmy Revels  a pantomime which was performed in the season of and with considerable success I know not who wrote the words I only set the music and it produced me no emolument as it came under my article    The Wedding Ring  the season of and This piece I wrote and composedbut foreseeing the difficulties I was likely to encounter had no intention of making myself known as the author The world recollects the ignominy with which Mr BICKERSTAFF left this kingdom and an invidious public print had the audacity to attribute this piece to him Finding the attack a very serious one I immediately made an affidavit that Mr BICKERSTAFF was  not  the author and published it This oath was called a prevaricating one because it did not say  who was  the author and a whole string of paragraphs of a most abusive kind were immediately levelled at me in the same paper I did not wait for the tedious forms of law but endeavoured to take that sort of revenge which men perhaps imprudently endeavour to do when the offence is beyond legal reparation The printer however had as little  courage to meet my anger as he had principle in seeking to wound my character He left town to avoid me and for some time was not to be seen I therefore moved the Court of King's Bench for him to shew cause why an information should not lodge against him for printing a libel The rule was  granted  and afterwards  made absolute  and there is no doubt but the gentleman would have been publicly exhibited had not my attorney taken it into his head to decamp to FRANCE with the money which to the great credit of the  Drurylane  performerswho insisted upon taking up this attrocious matter as a public causewas raised by a subscription among themselves to defend the action On the first night of this piece I was called on the stage and required to declare the author which I did without hesitation and the matter taking this turn I resolved instead of concealing my name always in future to announce it and rely on the public for the event I had a benefit for this piece over and above my article which yielded me upwards of an hundred pounds The publication of the music I undertook myself and got nothing by it Indeed I have always made this remark that the music I have sold has yielded but very little except to the publishers and that I have published on my own account has constantly brought me in debt    The Installation  the same seasonwritten by Mr GARRICK and composed under my article This I sold with a set of harpsichord lessons for a conditional sixtyfive pounds The conditions were fulfilled and I received the money    The Ladle  a little piece for  Sadler's Wells  in the season of written and composed by me    The Mischance  the same place and also written and composed by me For the publication of this piece  The Ladle  and  The Brickdustman  I received thirty guineas  Two pantomimesthe names I cannot recollect The publication of one of these I sold for ten guineas    The Grenadier  written for  Sadler's Wells  the same season by Mr GARRICK    The Widow of Abingdon  written also for  Sadler's Wells  the same season by Mr HULL All these were composed under my article They made up the entertainment of the whole season    Trip to Portsmouth  written by G A STEVENS and performed at the  Haymarket  with good success I received for the composition and the publication of the music nearly fifty pounds    The Deserter  altered from the French and performed at  Drurylane  in the years and the music partly retained partly supplied from  Philidor  and partly mine For this piece I had a benefit which yielded me about ninety poundsthe music turned out a very trifleI got by the publication of the words about thirty pounds    The Christmas Tale  written by Mr GARRICK and performed the same season The intrinsic value of this composition being equal to my whole salary I expostulated with Mr GARRICKwho said he considered it in the same light and I should have no reason to complain My trouble on this occasion was inconceivable and I expected my extra reward would be proportionable but when the end of the season arrived in the office were found two promissory notes of ten pounds each which I had given by way of memorandums at two different settlements and these were sent me by GEORGE GARRICK as a valuable consideration for my additional trouble The publication of the music I sold for twentyfive pounds down twentyfive pounds on the twelfth night twentyfive pounds on the eighteenth night and twentyfive pounds on the twenty  fifth  The piece was performed twenty  four  times  Two pantomimes and four little pieces for  Sadler's Wells  under my article  A short masque in  Amphytrion  in the season under my article of course I sold this music for some trifling sum  Two pantomimes and four little pieces for  Sadler's Wells  Two of these I wrote but though I recollect the subjects I really do not the titles'tis however no great matter these six performances made up the entertainment of the season I had nothing of consequence bid for the music and I did not chuse to venture the publication of it on my own account    The Waterman  performed the same summer at the  Haymarket  The success of this piece is well known The benefit yielded me but thirtyfive pounds The publication of the words about fortyeight and the music I believe about thirty pounds    The Cobler  performed in the season and Mr GARRICK would insist upon having this piece I had taken to him  The Seraglio  which was afterwards performed at  Covent Garden  and which if I had been on the spot I am convinced would have had better successbut he had conceived great displeasure at my bringing out  The Waterman  at the  Haymarket  though under different pretences he refused to perform it himself and therefore I must write he said a direct  farce  and nothing else which the more I altered the less I liked though the alterations were to please him At length I understood he did not intend to perform any thing but having urged him pretty strenuously he said it should be done if I would get it up in a week This I did to his astonishment and the next news was that the Lord Chamberlain would not license it Upon my talking of waiting on Lord HERTFORD about it as there was nothing immoral in it all of a sudden a license arrived and the picce came out It was not greatly received but after the fourth night it went on very well till the  tenth  whenlike  Liberty Hall  it was  damned by a party  I got from first to last by it about an hundred and twenty pounds  I am afraid this matter of fact business tires you I'll please you however

To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  FOR BRERETON's benefit in I brought out    The Quaker  This piece meeting with success he bought it of me for seventy pounds and sold it afterwards to GARRICK for an hundred Had I not parted with it in this way however I might have kept it by me for GARRICK had for some time determined not to produce any thing of my writing if he could possibly avoid it He had no idea that I intended to dabble in this way when he signed the article and therefore conceived my whole employ would be to set words of his writing and a blessed time I should have had on't if I had never done any thing else For this purpose he was scheming to get rid of Mr BICKERSTAFF as fast as he could and the very particular civilities he just then shewed that pretty gentleman to cover his intention probably procured him that scandalous and undeserved poem from Dr KENRICKhis wishes however were anticipated as the world knows When I produced him the  Wedding Ring  and afterwards the  Deserter  he found I could make some stand in this way and his discontent from that moment was evident to every body He was like  Captain Plume  he would not have a man who could write in his company Indeed the most tremendous weapon in  the world to GARRICKwas  a pen The Waterman  following up the  Deserter  and becoming also very popular my business was done I have shewn how he behaved in the affair of the  Cobler  and as to the  Quaker  he would not have suffered it to be got up at BRERETON's benefit had not the latter insisted upon it as his right Even then the copy was submitted to his inspection and he returned it with a sneer saying  "he wished him success but he was rather afraid the spirit would move the audience to damn it"  BRERETON took fire at this and shewed it to his friend Mr SHERIDAN who spoke of it in terms of commendation All difficulties were now at an end Mr SHERIDAN's pen was more to be feared than mine The next season Mr GARRICK purchased it as I mentioned before but not with a view of performing it for this piece did not make its second appearance till the management of  Drurylane  fell into other hands Added to the seventy pounds I received forty pounds for the publication of the words and about the same sum for the music It will be seen that I did nothing of consequence under my article since the  Christmas Tale  which was entirely owing to this jealousy of GARRICK'sin consequence of which he gave the  Maid of the Oaks  to Mr BARTHELEMON and  Alfred  to THEODORE SMITHin both of which pieces by the bye I received  orders  to make alterations and set additional songs Alterations I peremptorily refused to make thinking it scandalously indelicate to those gentlemen nor would I compose an additional song for  Alfred  which Mr BLANCHARD of  Covent Garden  then a child may remember was intended for himbut menaced with an action for the penalty of my article rather than incur the forfeiture of five hundred pounds I reluctantly set the song beginning  "What cannot beauty lovely beauty do"  in the  Maid of the Oaks  My usual quantity of business for  Sadlers Wells  ia the season    The Metamorphoses  an afterpiece brought out at the  Haymarket  in the summer of When this piece had been performed four nights I  left the care of it to Mr FOOTE who promised to do every thing handsome in it and went to FRANCE The moment my back was turned however he forgot his promisefor he only performed it once more and I reaped no manner of emolument from it whatever Indeed every thing about this time went at sixes and sevens with him for he never  "joyed himself"  after the business of the coachman  At the end of this season as every body knows FOOTE was advised to go to FRANCE to dissipate his chagrin The morning he left NORTH END going into his parlour he fixed his eyes for some time on the print taken from that picture so admirably painted by ZOFFANI of FOOTE and WESTON' in the  Devil  and Dr  Last  At last heaving a deep sigh he exclaimed  "Alas poor WESTONvery soon it will be alas poor FOOTE"  He died about three weeks after  On the words I had a loss and the music was never published  Business for  Sadlers Wells  Mr KING did not call on me for more work this year    The Seraglio  This piece was accepted by Mr HARRIS previous to my departure for FRANCE and performed in the season and I should mention also that I then left my affairs in the hands of Dr ARNOLD who superintended them till my return and common justice bids me say that he discharged his trust with great honour and fidelity for which kindness I now give him my public thanks I have yet every letter he wrote me and really there are many of the kindest and most disinterested sentiments of friendship I ever read To say the truth he had trouble enough on my account for the first stipulation Mr HARRIS made was to alter the pieces in whatever way he pleased In consequence of this when I came to read in the paper the plot of the  Seraglio  at CALAIS I found it totally different from that which I had sent and I remember the doctor's letter that accompanied the account of its reception says that if I were to see it I should scarcely know my own piece Mr HARRIS also obliged him to new set some of the songs which he assures me was a most irksome task but he rather undertook it than that  the piece should not be performed The benefit for this yielded me fortyeight pounds the words fifty and I sold the music for an eventual sixty poundsfortyfive of which became due    The Razor GrinderYo Yea or the Friendly TarsOld Woman of Eighty  and  The Mad Doctor  four pieces which I sent Mr KING from FRANCE These pieces were sold out and out at a very reasonable price But I again repeat that all my engagements with Mr KING were pleasurable ones and had I made him a present of half I have done for him I should still be under obligations to him    Poor Vulcan  a burletta performed in the season and at  Covent Garden  and which I boldly pronounce had it been given to the public in the state I sent it would have had much greater success It is uniformly said that the first act of this piece is remarkably complete and it must be confessed that from the beginning of the second act to  Vulcan's  soliloquy is as dull as any thing possibly can be and the reason is the burlesque is totally dropt and  Adonis  by the assistance of Mr HULL's somniferous museconverted into a sighing dying sleeping swain whereas I had made him a burlesque character as well as the rest  I am glad of this opportunity of shewing how authors are treated by managers and their privy counsellors and am ready to stand or fall by the decision of the public on the merits of what has been taken away and what substituted This shall be considered in the next letter In the mean time rejoice with me that at the end of two more we shall have waded together through this rubbish  Yours C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER LXXIII  THE THEATRICAL PRUNING KNIFE  "  The king's a good poetwith a little of my help  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  MY idea of making  Adonis  a  burlesque shepherd  I thought perfectly a new one  His first song was a parody on  "When forc'd from dear Hebe to go"  The first verse ran thus  When forc'd from dear MAUDLIN to go  Of a large humming glass she drank part  And I thoughtbut it might not be so  That the poor creature took it to heart  We guzzled till tipsy we grew  For my path I could scarcely discern  And for her stead of saying adieu  She hiccup'd out"Prithee return"  His second song was a parody on  "Dear Chloe come give me sweet kisses"  I shall not have room for it at length but I'll give you the last verse  Count the coin at the mint they are weighing  Count the cash at the bank that's conceal'd  Count the rouleaus at BROOKES's they're paying  And what Pharoah and Quince nightly yield  Count the Exchequer tallies so even  Go number the Treasury's store  And when so many guineas you've given  I still shall be asking for more  But my great favourite is the following imitation of HORACE and LYDIA  JOE  When Serjeant BELLSWAGGER that masculine brute  One day had been drinking to swear a recruit  He kiss'd you I saw him or else may I die  And you  cruel  MAUDLIN ne'er once cried O fie  Again when the squire had come home from the chase  You receiv'd him O Gods with a smile on your face  Henceforth then my sheep harum skarum may run  For MAUDLIN is faithless and I am undone  MAUDLIN  Ah JOE you're a good oneone day in my place  My husband at home I was forc'd to send GRACE  I know for a truth which ye cannot gainsay  You touzled her well on a cock of new hay  Nay swore you'd be hersand what is worse yet  That you only lov'd me just for what you could get  As for charms then I ne'er will believe I have one  For JOEY is faithless and I am undone  JOE  Will you know then the truth on'tI touz'd her I own  Though I rather by half would have let it alone  But I did it to see if you jealous would prove  For that people say  is a sure sign of love  MAUDLIN  And for me if the SQUIRE said soft things in my ear  I suffer'd it thinking he'd call for strong beer  And as to the serjeant 'tis always a rule  One had better be kiss'd than be teaz'dby a fool  I could not resist the insertion of these songs that it may be seen whether either justice or judgment is generally exercised in mutilations of this sortThe benefit for  Poor Vulcan  yielded about ninetyfive pounds the music was sold for fifty pounds and the words for sixty pounds At this time the expence  of the benefits was raised by the famous coalition of Mr SHERIDAN and Mr HARRIS to an hundred guineas I however would not pay it nor was it after my positive refusal insisted on    The Gypsies  an afterpiece written by me and composed by Dr ARNOLD It was performed at the  Haymarket  in the summer of but was rather a losing game The profitshad there been anywere to have been divided    The Touchstone  performed in the season and a pantomime written and composed by me under a verbal agreement with Mr HARRIS at the rate of three hundred pounds for the quantity of three afterpieces and every thing over and above to be paid for in proportion This piece has been attributed to Mr PILON and to Mrs COWLEY The fact is that in spite of all I could do Mr HARRIS would be trying to foist in alterations which had very nearly parted us before this entertainment came out I consented however to none but a few that were made by Mr GARRICK After the piece was out however and fairly Mr HARRIS's property it was not in my power to prevent his doing what he pleased with it and by this means that contemptible scene got into it of the  rout  which I with particular pleasure acknowledge is  not  mine the emoluments however  were  and they consisted of an hundred pounds for the piece as a performance an hundred pounds by Mr HARRIS for the copyright of the words and twenty pounds for the music    Rose and Colin  a piece of one act performed very frequently and with great applause    Annette and Lubin  of the same description and performed as successfully    The Wives revenged  rather longer but of the same description These piecestogether with the  Saloon  the  Graces  and the  Statue  afterwards performed with great success at the  Circus  are what I allude to in my letter to Mr HARRIS I received fifty pounds for each of them and sixty pounds for the music of the three from Mr HARRISthe words I kept which according to custom were unproductive  A pantomimethe name of which I do not recollect In it was introduced that song  "Give round the word dismount dismount"  It was only a revived thing and together with the song sung so well by Mrs KENNEDY in the  Comedy of Errors  and some other matters estimated at fifty pounds    The Chelsea Pensioner  same season This piece came out with Miss MORE's  Percy  which tragedy though it is by no means devoid of merit was not well received and my opera had like to have suffered by being in company with it The success of the  Chelsea Pensioner  however afterwards was very flattering yet it was done but three nights in allowing to the lateness of the season Why Mr HARRIS has not repeated it since he knows best as there were four songs encored on the last night it was performed This piece was an overplus charge of an hundred pounds

however what I neglect in  detail  I must make up in  point    Mirror  a pantomime burletta performed with considerable success at  Covent Garden  in the season of and This piece was strong satire and therefore  "  cavier  to the multitude"  who however were charmed with the scenery One circumstance marks this performance very strongly The character of  Punch  whose  bibbery bino  begot all the  fal de rals  and  te de rees  which have so largely contributed to make up the reputation of Mr EDWIN and which was a satire upon  nonsense  is now forgotten for nonsense itself For this piece I received a sixth of the six first nights amounting to about an hundred and thirty pounds The words yielded me about twenty pounds and the music ten pounds    The Shepherdess of the Alps  an opera in three acts This piece fell for want of support I remember VERNON's saying when he was asked why he did not get perfect and play his best  "that he saw it was the general wish  the piece should be damned and as in duty bound he lent it a hand"  My agreement for this piece was to have a third of the nine first nights It was performed but three I received about seventeen pounds    Plymouth in an Uproar  a piece brought to me by a seafaring gentleman I made some alterations in it at his desire and it succeeded pretty well being performed about twelve nights My share of the profits came to about sixtyfive pounds    The Islanders  an opera of three acts performed in the season of and This piece had very good success and is remembered to have contained some of Mrs KENNEDY's most favourite songs and many other very popular things I was to have had for it a third of the nine first nights but the KING coming to the performance on the sixth I was obliged to submit to take in the tenth which made a difference to me of more than fifty pounds I however from first to last got by this piece about three hundred and fifty pounds Instead of coming out in the course of the business in the second seasonwhich it might have done with considerable reputationMr HARRIS made me cut it down into a farce and call it  The Marriage Act  The alterations this piece underwent previous to its coming out were innumerable Some few of them were suggested by Mr HARRIS but I'll venture to say it gained nothing by that Mr WOODFALL saw a sketch of the first act in a rough state and in a letter which I have by me declared it bid the fairest for popularity of any thing he had seen It was certainly a very great favourite with Mr HARRIS who advised me not to confess myself the author urging me with words  "more than belonged to such a trifle"  for he said JUNIUS was not yet knownand therefore he would not advise me to declare myself To be sure there were some flying reports that Mr HARRIS wrote it himselfbut it will hardly be thought he wished those to be credited    Harlequin Free Mason  same season This piece had a prodigious run I wrote the words and composed the music My emoluments were seventy pounds from the theatre I sold about books which yielded mefor so well are these things managedabout thirtyfive pounds and the music was distributed in a work called the  Lyrist  which publication yielded me nearly fifty pounds    Amphytrion  performed in the season of and This piece was the only instance in which I made a point of  securing myself  Mr HARRIS and I parted as I have before mentioned I had nothing to do with conducting it and it was performed but two nights I received for it two hundred and eightyfive pounds    The Barrier of Parnassus The Graces The Saloon The Milkmaid The Refusal of Harlequin The Land of Simplicity The Passions The Statue Clump and Cudden The Benevolent Tar The Regions of Accomplishment Lancashire Witches The Cestus Pandora The Long Odds  These two or three other pantomimes four or five  intermezzos  of a more trifling kind and at least fifteen ballads each taking twelve or fourteen airs and an overture with a variety of other matter make up what I did for the  Circus  where in the first season I cleared upwards of nine hundred poundsbut from that moment my connexion with this place has been a series of trouble loss and vexation which to enumerate would make up as long a work as this I shall say a few words on this head however in a future letter    Liberty Hall  performed with the success I have already stated at  Drurylane

bargained for no great matter    Harvest Home  performed at the  Haymarket  I was nine pounds in debt on the benefit the words I sold for forty pounds and the music did about as much as  Liberty Hall  These pieces were I to go over every ground would come up to very near an hundred but  Richmond Marybone Exeter Change  and some other places where I have produced performances shall be given in to heap up the measure What I have done will astonish the reader sufficientlyfor he will see that in twentythree years I have received only about five thousand five hundred pounds even when I add my

often delivered and frequently to very little purpose under the title of READINGS and MUSIC This I shall follow up with some finishing observations a very brief recapitulation of all I have advancedplaced by way of critique on myself in every possible point of viewand at length a farewel to that country which I hope I have shewn that I quit not upon slavish and narrow but liberal and

nature and tendency The first would be no very easy matter to accomplish for it is of  so eccentric a kind that it will not in any respect tally with whatever may be measured by the standard of regularity But as to its drift I believe it may have as legitimate pretensions to public favour as any other amusementMatters of this kind in general aim at satisfying the auditors with an eye to the advantage of their fabricators like the physician who as he held out his hand for a see and was professing how disinterested he gave his advicesaying  'I take all this pains for you'  was answered by the sick Irishman as he put the guinea into his hand  'true true  all  for me and a little for yourself doctor'  Were I kept to the letter of my promise it would be my indispensible duty to improve

These will be my moments of triumph Besides I have a resource to which many have resorted with wonderful success Sound has often proved a fortunate succedaneum for sensefor music like charity covers a multitude of faults How often has the rickety deformity of a hobbling line been wrought into symmetry by the elegance of a beautiful passagean uncouth rhime rendered as smooth as the honey of Hybla by the force of modulationand a whole mouthful of expletives gracefully swallowed by the operation only of a few chromatics  Various friends however have suggested various improvements on my own ideas One of these you would have taken for a cook for he said he would undertake to supply my mental banquet with a curious and plentiful collection of dishes suitable to all palates He told me he had  roasted  NABOBS and  stewed  PATRIOTS  surprized  GENERALS and  devilled  LAWYERS For needy gentlemen become gamblers in their own defence he had a choice quantity of  pigeons  He had  ducks  and  drakes  for speculators in the alley Then  for fish he had a  plaise  for  sycophants  who chose to apply for it He had  good soles  for the promoters of  conviviality  and he had  gudgeons  for political and physical quacks That to be sure he could not brag much upon the article of  maids  but then to make amends he had a liquorish  old wife  in high season for a ruined  spendthrift  Then for a deserthe had  sugar plums  for the  conscientious trifles  for  fops whip syllabubs  for  orators ice  for  young widows  and  hard crusts  and  bitter almonds  for  critics  But what he most of all recommended was his  flummery  which he said was made of such delicious materials that it would be greedily swallowed by all distinctions from a  bishop  to a  beggar  A Frenchman advised me to fill my entertainment with dances which he assured me was not only the very essence of all public amusement but contained every requisite accomplishment for the completion of a fine gentleman But I will endeavour to give you his own words  '  MonsieurSare  look all over de varld every ting depend pon larn to  danse Sans cela  vidout larn to  danse  you cannot vat you call see lifeyou cannot know

Opera house telling him if he should chance to get paid he might perhaps dance away with English bank note too  An Italian let me into the secret of all that has been done in the way of taking people by the ears since this country could boast an opera house He told me it was as easy to make music by receipt as macaroni But as an Italian never explains himself so well at when he sings I will endeavour to give you his idea of a recipe for a  bravura  song to musicand to music in the next page follows the very song I introduced upon this occasion I therefore finish this letter with

thus went on  I could not help confessing there was certainly some ingenuity in this mode of spinning music but I thought it too much like the labours of the spider whichthough curioushave neither  beauty  nor  durability  I consequently determined to rely on my own judgment You will thereforeproceeded Isuppose me a painter with my canvass upon an eifel and my whole apparatus lying before me preparing to present you with a faint sketch of human nature not as I have sometimes seen it described with the virtues rising on each other like the Alps and Apenines altogether as STUPENDOUS and altogether as  cold  nor again as a thing so fraught with depravity so pitiably contemptible that a man would rather be an  oyster  than an  emperor  but as we see it every day without making it either a flattering likeness or a  caricature  for though I shall throw the human mindif I may be allowed the figureinto every possible situation yet I shall not place it where I have not actually seen it It may sometimes be  ludicrous  but it shall be always  like  Imagine then that I have now filled my canvass with a number of lines curves parallels perpendiculars and dots faintly to represent a large groupe of charactersone projecting a leg another an arm and another a head and then suppose melike the man who shews the tombs in Westminster abbeyabout to explain their good bad and indifferent qualitiesjust as it may suit to illustrate my position and to this man I may be aptly comparedfor like him I have all the talk to myself and like him am paid before I shew any thing  Very poor however would be my reward if it was only derived from pecuniary gratification A warmer and more thankful sentiment fires my breast no less than that as I am impelled alone by gratitude to appear before you I may hope for your kind and gentle wishes for my safety health and prosperity  When I did not finish the exordium in this manner it ran as followsfrom the words  "my own judgment"  I shall therefore present you with a melange which I trust will be found to be neither regularly dull nor ridiculously eccentric but a sort of medium between these extremes tending sometimes to provoke an involuntary sigh but much oftener a spontaneous smile and though I profess it to be out of all rule class or distinction yet I am sanguine enough to hope it will have as regular a beginning middle and end as an epic poem that it will commence with  curiosity  be followed up with  attention  and conclude withAPPROBATION  THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE  When impelld by my fortune new worlds to explore  I shall cheerfully leave the deminishing shore  Each hour bearing gratefully proudly in mind  How nobly a generous Public was kind  How nobly a generous Public was kind  How freely they'll give to their kind wishes  scope  As gayly I double the Cape of Good Hope  As gayly I double the Cape of Good Hope  How freely they'll give to their kind wishes scope  As galy I double the Cape of Good Hope    When from perils of dangerous Neptune set free  Trade winds and monsoons left behind me at sea  I make Rajahs and Nabobs in harmony chime  And gay palanquins march in regular time  Through the wishes to which you shall then give a scope  I shall double with ease for fortune's Cape of Good Hope    When by dint of my crotchets my catches and glees  I have chang'd current notes into sterling rupees  Sighing still for that pow'r of attraction sweet home  I'm no longer impell'd by a motive to roam  I shall still to my strong grateful feelings give scope  That through you I first doubled the Cape of Good Hope  This song finished the exordiumI then began as follows  PART I  CASSANDER cut to the soul at being tornthrough the avarice of her fatherfrom the arms of his SOPHRONIA retired to a remote part of the kingdom to contemplate on her virtues  HORTENSIA the beautiful and envied wife of the gallant FERDINAND had been married but a little month when provoked by the insolence of a saucy calumniator her husband fell defending her honour Grief induced her to retire and chance directed her to where CASSANDER sighed in secret for the loss of his SOPHRONIA Accident brought them togetherwhen urged by the congeniality of their sentiments they vowed on the spot an eternal friendship and agreed to meet every morning in the same place to recite such stories of private misery as had fallen within their notice occasioned either by false honour or the insatiable cruelty of avaricious parents  CASSANDER on his return ransacked his library to find food for new friendship which at its birth demanded to be nourished HORTENSIA came homesat down to her harpsichordsighed and sung  AIR  Who to my wounds a balm advises  But little knows what I endure  The patient's pain to torture rises  When med'cine's try'dand fails to cure  What can the wisest counsel teach me  But sad remembrance of my grief  Alas his counsel cannot reach me  It gives but wordsI ask relief  After this the subject changesI shall therefore stop short for the present with a fresh assuranceand as true as the restthat I am  Most sincerely Yours C DIBDIN  Liverpool    March    LETTER LXXVII  A JOVIAL MEETING  "  Mirth admit me of thy crew  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  To chequer the entertainment and render it a little more lively I thus went on  I shall now introduce you to a set of gentlemen whose evenings were  jovially  employed in the same degree as the mornings of CASSANDER and HORTENSIA were devoted to despondency  This company consisted of a PROJECTOR who had tired the royal society and impaired his fortune by schemes that had every thing to  perfect  them but  practicability  A SPECULATOR who had invented an instrument which was to foretel the coming change of the stocks upon the principle of a barometer but whounfortunately trusting too far to the infallibility of his projectwas obliged to  waddle out  A COMMODORE who had risen by his merit from the forecastle and had retired in disgust A POET who had never been able to get a play heard to the end of the first act A wild IRISHMAN who had blundered through a large patrimony fill he had nothing leftto use his own wordsbut the  purse  of a  beggar  and the  heart  of a  prince  And a LEVEE HUNTER who in the course of  thirteen years  was  once  within  five minutes  of seeing the  great man himself  These six grown wise from their disappointments had gathered together the scattered remains of their broken fortunes and determined to laugh away the rest of their lives Health followed them to the chace pleasure filled the teeming bowl and the only contention at their meetingswhere ANACREON might have been proud to sit presidentwaswho should be forwarderst to promote harmless mirth and inoffensive hilarity  The board being met and a few toasts drank the poet was called upon for a song He said he would give them a little satirical touch which he had that morning written against a lady who had been cruel to him He confessed it was maliciousor sobut he sincerely believed exactly in point for all that  AIR  That all the world is up in arms  And talks of nought but CELIA's charms  That crowds of lovers near and far  Come all to see this blazing star  Is truewho has not heard on't  But that she all at distance keeps  And that her virtue never sleeps  I don't believe a word on't  II  That for one lover had she ten  In short did she from all the men  Her homage due each day receive  She has good sense and I believe  Would never grow absurd on't  But for soft dalliance she'd refuse  Some favourite from the crowd to chuse  I don't believe a word on't  III  That in the face of standersby  She's modesty itself's no lie  That then were men rude things to say  'Twould anger heroh I would lay  A bottle and a bird on't  But to her bedchamber d'ye see  That BETTY has no private key  I don't believe a word on't  The conversation next turned on the lawand one of the company had mentioned the frequency of executions in this country From this the PBOJECTOR who was a bit of a wag took occasion to relate the following anecdote  A carpenter who could not get his money for two gibbets that had been bespoke refused to make a third and an execution having been in consequence delayedthe jailor being called to accountblamed the carpenter who was at length summoned before the judge The judge told him he had ordered the gibbet and demanded in a very preremptory way the reason it had not been made The carpenter with the greatest simplicity in nature excused himself by telling the truthsaying  'I refused the hangman and the jailor to make a  third  gibbet because I had not been paid for the  two first  but if I had known the gallows had been for your LORDSHIPwhy lord love you it should have been  done out of hand  '  The POET was noticing how sometimes the most trivial and unforeseen accident overturns an author's hopes  'A thing'  said he  'once happened to me which was enough to make a man forswear ever taking a pen in hand I had a tragedyGARRICK performed in itI must confess the principal incident was a little similar to LEAR's abdication of the throne in favour of his daughters Mine were two daughters and the kingafter giving them a lesson fraught  with legislative advantages that might have done honour to SOLON or LYCURGUSfinished his harangue with saying  "and now I divide this crown between you"  Sir a malicious scoundrel peeping over the spikes of the orchestra and staring GARRICK full the face cried out  "Ah that's just  half acrown apiece  "  Sir an incessant laugh immediately prevailed and if it had been to save your soul another syllable was not to be heard and thus the world lost for ever four acts and a half of the finest writing'  "I am glad on't"  said the COMMODORE  "if you had not been disabled in giving chace to the public you would never have come to safe moorings in grog harbour Here"  said hetaking the bowl  "is the only sheet anchor a seaman can trust to Blow high blow low let the storm tear the cable from the cathead or the shrouds from the catharpin  grog  will bring us through all weathers and shew a smiling face in the bowl when clouds and billows are in the maddest contention"  The COMMODORE's song of  grog  shall begin my next letter in the interim I finish this as usual with assuring you that I am  Ever yours C DIBDIN  Liverpool    March    LETTER LXXVIII  A SEA SONG AND AN IRISH ONE  "  Drink drink and defy  "  The mad spirits that fly  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  NOW for the COMMODORE's song  AIR  A plague of those musty old

swigg'd and all of us swigg'd it  And swore there was nothing like  grog  IV  Then trust me there's nothing like drinking  So pleasant on this side the grave  It keeps the unhappy from thinking  And makes e'en more valiant the brave  As for me from the moment I twigg'd it  The good stuff has so set me agog  Sick or well late or early  Wind foully or fairly  Helm alee or aweather  For hours together  I've constantly swigg'd it  Anddammethere's nothing like  grog  The COMMODORE then gave May our sea of delight never ebb The POET said it was impossiblefor they drew their mirth from the follies of mankind which source was inexhaustible This gave rise to a mixed conversation in which scarcely any subject escaped them Impostors of all denominations were severely handled and particularly pretenders to courage This naturally brought up duelling and one of them said in a country like this where there are such admirable laws he wondered it was not put a stop to Laws

story about fighting which he finished the conclusion of by saying he had killed three men I told him that his three men was nothing at all at all a jolman in my country would kill thirteen and eat

paltroon and a  puppy Oh it would have done your heart good to see me rouse from my lethargy of passive endurance I appointed them all at different times and places on the same morningkilt 'em and retired to the Continent About a month afterwards I was in a coffeehouse in France where a great big Swiss officer who was poring over the papers seemed extremely offended at the vacant silliness of a young Frenchman whoas SHAKESPEARE says of  Gratiano  was talking a great deal about nothing at all at all Ahsaid old crusty  le diable soit le petit jean foutre  The youngster in a  hop step  and  minuet jump  skipt up to him and demanded in the civilest manner who he had thought proper to honour with so elegant an appellation He was answered  VousMoiVousvous etes un petit jean foutre  They went out and in ten minutes the Swiss returned in all the easy tranquillity imaginable having killed the Frenchman The affair became presently the talk of the coffeeroom  c'etois bien dommage mais comment faire  Monsieur  avois le humeur noir  I could not help saying that  Monsieur's humeur noir  was but a poor excuse for having kilt the young man I was asked to explain myself To be sure I did not civilly comply with his request by knocking his Ramilee wig about Out we went and by as pretty a little genteel cunning lunge as ever made an eyelet holeI cured Monsieur of his  humeur noir  and fait every other care This was my seventh man my eighth was a Dutchman whom I was obliged to fight with knives over a table for nothing in life only because I happened to say by accident that their women their ships and their pugs dogs were all cast in the same mould My affair in ENGLAND being now pretty well blown over I ventured to return but that I might be sure every thing was sung I got a friend to look out for me while I lay quiet at a lodging in DEAL"  "In the family you see dere was an old gentleman who out of four children had three sons and a daughter I had not been there a week before the daughter fell in love with me Dat you know was natural enough 'Tis a dillycate affairbut a pregnancy was the consequence What was to be  done The brothersOh they watched me with the eyes of a cat or a rattle snake They were determined it seems to massacre me I had an intimation of their design from the dear girl herselfa charming lovely dear tender delicious creature I appeared before them and desired I might be permitted to defend myself My request was generously granted Oh it cut me to the soul but I performed my part as nobly as  Horatius  with  Curiatii  I kilt 'em all three

him that as I had not discredited his story I should insist on his not doubting mine At this the laugh became general and the poor devil of a duellist was glad enough to sneak out of the room  And serve him right toosaid the COMMODORE There are three occasions and only three that justify a man's risking his lifehis country his wife and his friend for life d'ye see is a ship that providence has

same express the crew commanded  Once more to view their native land  Among the rest brought JACK some tidings  Would it had been his love's fair hand  Oh fateher  death  defac'd the letter  Instant his pulse forgot to move  With quiv'ring lips and eyes uplifted  He heav'd a sigh  and dy'd for love  As I never sung this song but I was obliged to pause a little till the buz of the company ceased I

To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  YOU may remember after the songI said  Neither the COMMODORE's remarks nor his song could do away the vein of conversation that had before taken place Every notorious lie that could be thought of was related One said he had heard a lawyer aver his business was of so vast and extensive a nature that he cleared two hundred a year by only melting the wax of the chancery and other seals in the course of his practice This gentleman however was outdone by another who said he had such a countinghouse full of clerks that he saved double that sum in ink and expedition by only leaving out tittles and dashes But the thing that seemed to be best relished was an account of a man who undertook to jump off the monument  'The fact'  said the speculator who told the story  'was as follows One PETER WILKINS a biscuit maker by trade undertook to jump off the monument He was to mount on the rails when St PAUL's clock should strike twelve and he was to jump off at the last stroke Every precaution was of course taken to keep the poor devil from breaking his neck Feather beds loads of straw and woolpacks were piled upon each other to an immense height The day camethe  streets seemed to be paved with faces and the houses roofed with people The usual accidents happened Broken limbs dislocations fractures and contusions were plenty Women with children in their arms were thrown down and trod upon while old chimney stacks tiles and brickbats flew about like hail Well Sir the moment arrivedthe clock struckand honest PETER true to his trust mounted upon the balustrades At the last strokeoff he went Icod Sirwhen he was half way downhis heart failed him  and  HE JUMPED BACK AGAIN'  The company getting a little into disorder silence was commanded and a hunting song called for which was given them by the POET  AIR  At the sound of the horn  We rise in the morn  And waken the woods as we thunder along  Yoix yoix tallyho  After reynard we go  While echo on echo redoubles the song  II  Not the steeds of the sun  Our brave coursers outrun  O'er the mound horse and hound see us bound in full cry  Like Phoebus we rise  To the heights of the skies  And careless of danger five bars we defy  III  At eve Sir we rush  And are close to his brush  Already he dies see him panting for breath  Each feat and defeat  We renew and repeat  Regardless of life so we're in at the death  IV  With a bottle at night  We prolong the delight  Much Trimbrush we praise and the deeds that were done  And yoix tallyho  The next morning we go  With Phoebus to end as we mount with the sun  I then returned to my desponding lovers butlest the matter should grow too graveI gave it the following turn  CASSANDER met his friend HORTENSIA as usual and while they were moralizing on the uncertainty of sublunary felicity a conversation on the other side of the hedge attracted their attention I should have told you that ROBIN CASSANDER's confidential servant retired from a disappointment in love as well as his master nor was JENNY the handmaid of HORTENSIA behind hand with her mistress in heroic sentiments These two it seemsprofitting by the lessons of their superiorshad sought also for consolation in each others friendships  'And so Mr ROBIN'  said JENNY  'you really say you have a pleasure in my company'  "So much Mrs JENNY"  said ROBIN  "that I almost begin to forget PEG already But if this is the case what sort of things we lovers must be I certainly did love that jade else what need had I to run two hundred miles to shut myself up among woods and grottos dripping fountains and murmuring brooks I'll tell you how the thing is"  'No no'  said JENNY  'let me tell you how it is You  men are a set of easy credulous foolish creatures and the simplest

again who being still very loud on the subject of braggadocias are stopped short by one of the company who sings the following song  AIR  CURTIS was old HODGE's wife  For vartue none was ever such  She led so pure so chaste a life  HODGE said 'twas vartue over much  For says sly old HODGE says he  Great talkers do the least d'ye see  II  CURTIS said if men were rude  She'd scratch their eyes out tear their hair  Cry'd HODGEI believe thour't wond'rous good  However let us nothing swear  For says c  III  One night she dreamt a drunken fool  Be rude with her in spite would fain  She makes no more but with joint stool  Falls on her husband might and main  Still says c  IV  By that time she had broke his nose  HODGE made a shift to wake his wife  Dear HODGE said she judge by these blows  I prize my vartue as my life  Still says c  V  I dreamt a rude man on me fell  However I his project marr'd  Dear wife cried HODGE 'tis mighty well  But next time do'nt hit  quite  so hard  For says c  VI  At break of day HODGE cross'd a style  Near to a field of newmown hay  And sawand curst his stars the while  CURTIS and NUMPS in am'rous play  Was not I right says HODGE says he  Great talkers do the least d'ye see  They then talked of authors The PROJECTOR who once had an idea of inventing a windmill to grind poetry maintainedthroughout the whole  time he was bit with this schemefourteen authors The company being very desirous of hearing something of the project and these scribbling dependants he gratified them by saying that his plan was in  idea  so constructed as to grind poetry according to the degree of violence or serenity with which the wind blew Zephyrs were to make pastoralsan unequal squally wind was to write pindaric odesMay breezes were to fabricate love songsand thunder storms were to give a faithful description of warlike exploits Then proceeding to speak of his poetswhat was the most extraordinary said he no two of them seemed to know each others profession any more than if they were of different professions Upon inquiring how this came about I found that poetry no more than physic is ever done in the  lump  for that one is employed to write tragedies and another dying speeches just as you have one doctor for the  teeth  and another for the  corns  Thus of one I learnt punning by rule  "By rule"  said the POET Yesthus A man says  'Mr LOCKE was a great  metaphysician  '  "Oh Lord"  says you  "that's nothing at allI  met a physician  myself yesterday"  The next rule is to lay a trap for a pun by a previous question Says you  'do you think the dinner is ready'  "I really don't know"  says one of the company  "I am going to  see  "  'Oh to  sea  are you'  says you  'I wish you  a good voyage  '  Or thussays you  'what do you think of this

sentiment manifested itself that they seemed animated with one soul Every lookevery sighevery wish was the same and they neither of them believedthough nothing could be more certainthat  friendship  had long since softened into  love  About this timeas CASSANDER was preparing to entertain HORTENSIA with a story calculated to awaken the whole force of her sensibilitya shower of rain obliged them to take shelter in the house where the first object that presented itself was a portrait of SOPHRONIA It is wonderful to what advantage the little subtel god turned this accident CASSANDER could not

horse and the vicissitudes of fortune that mark that creatures different stages of life naturally introduced a song which it seems was a favourite of the company  AIR  See the course throng'd with gazers the sports are begun  The confusion but hearI bet you Sirdone done  Ten thousand strange murmurs resound far and near  Lords hawkers and jockies assail the tir'd ear  Whilewith neck like a

racer is sold for the hounds  A whimsical extract from an entertainment was next producedwhere a magician had confined two unfortunate lovers who were tormented with the severest and most ingenious rigour This duty sometimes fell on a journeyman  conjurer who not being exactly  au sait  to this diabolical business did not always execute it so as to operate to his master's wishes In the extract I mentioned he is left with an injunction to conjure up every spirit of distress he can think of to terrify these lovers Poor TYCHO is horribly put to it to conceive how he can possibly find out these  spirits of distress  Having however determined to make the best of it he thus begins his incantation  AIR  Spirits of distress of ev'ry occupation  Persuasion mode complexion temper climate inclination  Come here come here  Spirit of a friar oblig'd to go to mass  Spirit of a sailor who leaves his pretty lass  Spirit of a drunkard deprived of his glass  Appear appear  II  Spirit of a

 Spirit of an alderman the dinner thrown down  Spirit of a lover who has just receiv'd a frown  Spirit of a beauty disappointed of her gown  Appear appear  Our TYCHO did not conceive there could be greater spirits of distress than these The poet however could not get his piece on the stage The history of its refusal brought up the subject of the theatre and this introduced several theatrical anecdotes among which the following one relative to THE CIBBER gave the company some pleasure  THEwho all the world knows to have been a great voluptuaryand who would give his last guinea for an ortolan and confiscate something to get it dressedhad dined in the city at a public entertainment and rendered himself very agreeable by relating a number of anecdotes and sporting other sallies of wit A few nights afterwards being in the boxes of the theatre he saw there one of the citizens he had dined with He spoke to him with great familiarity but was astonished to find his salute scarcely returned A second and a third attempt were as unsuccessful He therefore went into another box where sat one of his boon companions who had noticed the transaction The  bon vivant  began upon THE immediately  'What'  said he  'the old gentleman would not speak to you'  "No"  answered THE  "and I cannot for the life of me divine the reason It was but three days ago we were as intimate as gormandizing and hilarity could make us Why Sir I made him chuckle and shake his fat sides and rosy gills as often as there was a pause between a glass of  burgundy  and a mammoc of  green sat  Now he affects not to recollect me"  'And you pretend you don't know why'  said the other  "I have not the smallest conception"  said THE  'I'll set you right then'  said his companion  'Your intimate friend over a bottle chuses to disclaim you in the face of the world that's all He is a merchant of the city of LONDONa man of credit and reputationpays twenty shillings in the pound'  "Oh that's it is it"  said THE  "why then damme if I speak to him for  I pay  FIFTY"  I shall let the company enjoy their laugh and take that opportunity to give myself pleasure by assuring you once more that I am with great truth yours  C DIBDIN  Liverpool    March    LETTER LXXXIV  MORE VIVACITY AT THE EXPENCE OF ACTORS  "  For they are the abstract  "  And brief chronicle of the times  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  AS one anecdote naturally produces another I at different times took the opportunity while the club were on the subject of the theatre to introduce those which follow  An actor who had been used to perform  tragedy  and  comedy  indiscriminately was sent on for BUCKINGHAM in  Richard the Third  but not being very perfect he floundered through the part with great hesitation and in much confusion When he came to that soliloquy where RICHARD leaves him with these words  "I'm busythou troublest meI am not in the vein"  he was quite at a lossand so intimidated that he could not catch the word from the prompter The audience began to hiss and poor BUCKINGHAMafter the loss of the  "Earldom of HEREFORD"  had very nearly been pelted with rotten apples At length he recollected that he had played HODGE in  Love in a Village  the night before and feeling the situation to be exactly the same as that of BUCKINGHAM he hollowed out  "I thought it would come to this I'll be shot if I did not"  Another related an anecdote of Mrs CHARKE the daughter of COLLEY CIBBER She was playing IAGO in a barn and they were in great confusion about the difficulty of managing the business of the quarrel between CASSIO and RODERIGOfor which they wanted  three  swords whereas they had among them but  two  It was agreed however that one of them should stagger into the corner and so let his sword fall as if by accident between the scenes that thus she might find it and come on to wound CASSIOThis however was neglectedand seeing it was impossible to get a sword  'What the devil shall I do'  said she  'I must knock the fellow down'  Saying these words she ran into the dressing roomwhich was also a bedchamberand catched up an old bedpost with which she ran furiously at CASSIO and not to be worse than her promise laid on him pretty severely He speaking mechanically when he heard his cuewhich was accompanied by a blow on the  head  cried out in the words of his part  "Oh my LEG is cut in two"  The company being all lovers of theatrical merit these anecdotes induced them separately to hold forth in praise of those actors or actresses who had been their greatest favourites and having arrived to that pitch of tenacity when no one of them would cede his opinion the poet set them to rights by saying  'Gentlemen we have all our prejudicies I once illustrated this position pretty strongly in a fable'  A large company went to see a collection of various animals A  soldier  admired the  lion  a  sailor  the  nautilus  a  fine lady  the  ostrich  a  courtier  the  jackall  and an  hypocrite  the  hyena  A  humpbacked man  declared they were all fools each he said might have its particular merits but he would venture to prove beyond contradiction that for beauty and symmetry no  animal  upon the face of creation could equal theCAMEL  This reproach set them all into good humour and produced the folowing song from the COMMODORE  AIR  A sailor's love is void of art  Plain sailing to his port the heart  He knows no jealous folly  'Twere hard enough at sea to war  With boisterous elements that jar  All's peace with  lovely Polly  II  Enough that far from sight of shore  Clouds frown and angry billows roar  Still is he brisk and jolly  And while carousing with his mates  Her health he drinksanticipates  The smiles of  lovely Polly  III  Should thunder on the horizon press  Mocking our signals of distress  E'en then dull melancholy  Dares not intrudehe braves the din  In hopes to find a calm within  The snowy arms of  Polly  The COMMODORE now cried out  'POET I shall call upon

t'other  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  THE SPECULATOR before the company broke up entreated the POET to favour them with a song for which he had a great partiality It was a description of the confusion that about two years ago happened at Westminsterhall when an officious maid servant was washing the leads of the house of commons upon which a general panic ensued and in two minutes the court of king's bench exhibited the most ludicrous scene of whimsical consternation that ever was beheld  AIR  I'll tell you a storya story that's true  A story that's tragic and comical too  'Tis of a

C DIBDIN  Newcastleunderline    March    LETTER LXXXVI  EXTRANEOUS MATTER  "  About it goddess and about it  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  AT this place you may remember I pausedduring which interval I never failed to receive much kind attention from some part or other of my auditory to go into which would be in a degree to recapitulate  briefly  all those public remarks that I have already given AT LARGE I shall however though the harvest is over look through the field and pick up the gleanings Foras I set out with remarking that by means of taking my hearers at the moment I made them feel I became possessed of their fair unadulterated sentiments in a purer and more ingenuous manner than I should otherwise have been competent to doso you and my readers in general may not be displeased to get the essence of these cursory conversations  They consisted of kind enquiries whether I was not fatigued congratulations on a full room condolence on a thin onewhich last was nine times out of ten the case the solicitations that  never  failed to be made on a first night for a repetition of the performance all the insinuating cunning of asking whether I  really  meant to go to INDIA solicitude to know how I came to leave the  Theatres  questions concerning the present state of them  wishes to know why MALLET MURPHY and other ingenious men do not write for the stage how the town formerly so fond of trite sentiment is now become altogether as mad after puns and jests if Mr SHERIDAN has really given up the management of Drurylane theatre what can be the possible reason why  ladies  who write for the stage always introduce more balderdash than  men  A gentleman who I am sure would not care if I mentioned his name assured me he took some pains to get acquainted with one of these  soi disant  FEMALE SHAKESPEARES and very gravely recommended the following anecdotewhich I shall tell as decently as I canto be introduced as a monstrous good thing in one of her  comedies  He said it was in the stile of FOOTE only a little  fatter  A juryman who was troubled with the strangury entreated one of the gentlemen of the bar sitting near him to represent his situation and beg that he might be permitted for a short time to go out of court The judge having heard the request interrupted the trial by saying he had a new question for their observation and on which indeed he should be remiss in taking any step till he had submitted his reasons for so doing to the court Said he  "one of the jury hath craved leave to retire for a few minutes onlyfor an urgent purpose procured and caused by a grievous malady with which the poor man had the misfortune to be greatly afflicted The malady I allude to is the stranguryand it is a disorder which has some similitude to the stone or gravel or indeed both inasmuch as some learned physicians are of opinion"    'Indeed my lord'  said the juryman making a wry face  'it is very painful I wish your lordship would permit me to go out of court'  "Patience my good friend patience"  replied his lordship  "I greatly wish to oblige you but every thing here must be done according to form There are if I mistake not some cases on record and I believe on a cause folio B Yes I am right it was on an action brought for the recovery"    'Indeed my lord if you will let me go out of court'  cried the tortured juryman  'it will be the kindest  action  your lordship ever did in your life'  "Pray"  said his lordship  "don't interrupt me when I am expounding the law Yes yes it  was  so and then in another case HOGES  versus  WATKINS"    'Oh dear'  cried the juryman  "Where"  continued the judge  "a juryman as in the present case had with modest and becoming demeanour"    'Oh'  cried the juryman screwing up his muscles  "preferred to the bench upon the same emergent occasion a similar request"    'What shall I do'  bellowed out the juryman  "and if my memory fails me not there are two or three other cases which I could cite at length"  After reiterated pain which he was no longer able to endure the juryman cried out  'My lord you need not cite any more cases for I have pd my breeches'  If this elegant anecdote should grace the  lady's  next play I hope she will have gratitude enough to acknowledge to what patron she is indebted for it  why I always cut harder at the  law  than any other profession how much I am more than thirty years of age and whether the  Padlock  was not performed five and twenty year agothus endeavouring  to make it appear that I was on the stage before I was born and composed music before I could speak How I should have acted if ever I had been hissed  I had made up my mind upon this Had it ever happened I was determined to relate the following circumstance which really occured at EDINBURGH LEE and LOVE were mutually concerned in that theatre and they disputed as to the mode of conducting their different departments till at length the controversy arose to such a pitch that the town took part in it Thus whenever LOVE appeared LEE's friends hissed him and  vice versa  That part of the town that came merely to be amused and had too much good sense to interfere in so ridiculous a business by this means deserted the theatre and left it wholly occupied by the hisserswho also getting tired mustered thinner and thinner till the house exhibited very little more than empty benches LOVE finding his interest materially injured came to his senses first and determined if possible to put a finish to the matter For this purpose the first time he was hissed he came forward and having obtained a hearing said  "Ladies and gentlementhe next time you come to  hiss  I should be much obliged to you if you would bring  a few more with you  "  The consequence was inevitablenot only the audience but LEE him self felt the propriety of the reproof and the quarrel was made up from that moment  whether every thing I had given them was my own and in particular whether I wrote the words of the race horse which was the proper way to learn  music  whether it were better to begin with  thorough bass  the  gamut  or  by ear  and if a scholar should touch the instrument  at first  or a  year and a half afterwards  These together with many tenders of civility particularly letters to INDIAwhich I always took the freedom to acceptmade up the interval between the first and second parts of my

 "  Nature's nature every where  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  WHILE ULYSSES is lamenting his bad success he is surrounded by an APE who had been a COXCOMBa SPARROW who had been a COQUETTEa BEAR who had been a PLAIN DEALERa HEN who had been a WIDOWand several others who wondering at his impudence in attempting to set up the blind and uncertain dictates of REASON against the sure and unerring impulse of INSTINCT fairly hoot him off the island  This  extract  was then succeeded by the following sketchwhich I thus introduced  I shall now proceed to shew that the passions of  envy  and  resentment  are as  implacable  and as full of  subtile refinement  in the hearts of the most  uninformed  as the most  polished  CUDGO was a NEGRO and QUACO a MULATTO See how QUACO ridicules CUDGO for being further degenerated only in  one  degree from the European complexion than himself  "Ah damn you"  says QUACO  "you a black dogyou a  Jenny Neger  you don't tan like a me"  He then sings  "Common NEGER go down the road side  "UUCLE BEN walk up in the high road  "Tan yanda you black  Jenny  rascal  "Common NEGER drink out of  wooden bowl  "UNCLE BEN drink out  of china bason  "  Can there be more pointed satire than this Does it not convey all the conscious force of pride preeminence place and precedence as strongly as words can express He then goes on upbraiding him with his ignorance  "Ah you black dog do'nt you know bout the rum when you savee put letter under a tone"  CUDGO it seems was carrying a jug of rum and a letter to a friend of his master but meeting with another negro on the road he accosted  "Ah how you do buddy"  'Ah'  replied the other  'what buddy CUDGO wat a divle you carry one someting dere'  "Oh dishe da buckra rum master savee send um to anudder buckra lib in great house yonder"  'Ah buddylet us all two take a lilly sup'  "Ah dam"  says CUDGO  "you no see paper Paper la talkhe savee tell massa"  'Ah buddyappose we put paper under a toneden he no see'  Charmed with this idea they agreed to hide the letter under a stone  'Ah buddy dis be good stuff savee make a heart jump'  Having drank pretty heartily they begin to think of the consequence  "Ah damjug no full now"  'Buddy buddy'  says the other  'come to the ribbor put lilly wee drop water'  This executed CUDGO takes the letter and jogs on with the jug to his master's friend who not finding the rum above proof exclaims  'Why what is all this you scoundrel You have been drinking the  rum  and filled the jug with  water  '  "Ah massa"  says CUDGO  "do'nt you vexindeed I no do nothing"    'Nothingwhat do you think I can't read  "Ah massa if I no tell buddy Tom sodat dam paper savee talk very wicked for poor neger man"  These and other taunts and reproaches which have in them all the ridiculous pride and contemptible folly of selfconsequence at length rouses the NEGROwho falls foul of the MULATTO with equal success and in such  terms that had JUVENAL been a NEGRO he would have written in the language of CUDGO  "Why now"  says CUDGO  "you tink you dam creber fella too I apposeyou no NEGERno BUCKRAno  any ting  You dam  yellow copper kin  you  no nation  you a  mule  I make a sing upon you  SONG  QUACO BUNGY go about  Ca'nt tell him nation  BUCKRA make him foot ball  JENNY NEGER hate him  MUSTER won't own him  So he ca'nt tell him nation  Now I make a sing upon your sissy  II  FANNY BUNGY have  pickiny  No know him fader  Some say the soldier man  Some say the sailor man  Some say the fisherman  But he no know him daddy  The MULATTO who bore with great patience the satire on  himself  is roused to the highest pitch of indignation at the lampoon on his sisterat which moment the gentle ORRAa real Indian who had imbibed nothing beyond the uncontaminated simplicity of her native wilds and consequently approached nearer to primitive virtueORRA who had for the first time left her home in search of her YANKO whose absence though compelled by duty she could no longer bearthis ORRA surprized the uplifted arm of the  MULATTO just when his insidious revenge impelled him to aim a death blow at the heart of CUDGO ORRA though a  woman  seized QUACO like a  lioness  crying out  'Ah shame kill your buddy'  This enraged QUACO the more He cried out  "Buddywhat dam neger rascal from Jenny QUACO buddy"  'Yes'  replied ORRA  '  every man  your  buddy every woman  my  sissy  poor dear YANKO tell soand he honest man for true  AIR  Poor ORRA tink of YANKO dear  Do he be gone for ever  For he no dead he still live here  And he from here go never  Like on a

She then relates how many enemies she had forgiven in battle and shews with wonderful force and energy the comfort the convenience and even the strong political necessity of universal philanthropy and benevolence till at length won by her exemplary virtue both NEGRO and MULATTO forget their animosity and agree in their own language to take MISSA ORRA to de house and give her  nin yam  At this moment comes by an English sailor who highly applauding the sentiments of ORRA bursts into the following  forecastle  song  AIR  What argufies pride and ambition  Soon or late death will take us in

is that in comparison with my walk of characters Why during the last fortnight I played  Hamlet Richard Oroonoko  the  Earl of Warwick Petruchio Chamont  and the  Drunken Colonel  and make  nothing  of them"  Here enters the carpenter with  "Gentlemen if you please you that act in tragedy I wish you'd be so good to listen to the new thunderit is spick and span"  'Stop a minute'  says one  'before you go any further let me tell you a story about thunder LEE when he was manager at EDINBURGH was determined to improve upon thunder and so having procured a parcel of nine pound shot they were put into a wheelbarrow to which he affixed an octagon wheel This done there were ridges placed at the back of the stage and one of the carpenters was ordered to trundle this wheelbarrow so filled and accoutred backwards and forwards over these ridges'    "And I hope"  says the carpenter  "he would not get any of them to do it for him"  'Not one'  said the actor  'they had too much partiality for their old friend the thunder trunk'  "And they were right too"  said the carpenter  "The best feather in your wing Master  Tragedy  You may rant  gemmen  but if the thunder did not come for the  corps de resarve  and introduce the  handy climax  as a body may say your lungs I believe would cut but a poorish figure"  'Well'  said the actor  'what was to be done LEE was resolved to have his thunder and employed an  Elve  of his an actor of all work to turn carpenter on the occasion The play was  Lear  and really in the two first efforts the thunder had a good effect At length the poor baldpated king was braving  "the pitiless pelting of the storm"  when the thunderer's foot slipt and down he came wheelbarrow and all The stage being of course on a declivity the balls made their way towards the  orchestra  and meeting with but a feeble resistance from the scene presently laid it slat on its face LEAR was now to be encountered by a storm  much more difficult to stem than that which he had before complained of The balls taking every kind of direction he was under the necessity of skipping about to avoid them exactly like the man who dances the  egg hornpipe  nor was this allthe fiddlers fearing a demolition of their  catgut  catched up their instruments and skuttled out of the  orchestra  as hard as they could drive while to crown this glorious scene of confusion the sprawling actor in the sight of the audience lay prostrate like another SALMONEUS'  The actors being gone to hear the new thunder a female singer took that opportunity of trying a song with which I shall begin my

appear  I shall  pardon  the  treason  the TRAITOR'S SO DEAR  The song over and the actors returned from making an experiment of the new thunder the conversation became general again and the story of LEE and his thunder insensibly produced another anecdote of LEE When this strange manwho would have been a good MANAGER but for his  pride  and second to but very few as an ACTOR but for his  particularity  had the  management  of the theatre at BATH one of the actresses wanted to get up  Tamerlane  for her benefit LEE was determined not to oblige herindeed he had done nothing but thwart her the whole seasonbut he found it difficult to find a  reasonable excuse  She got the better of every obstacleand at length being driven fairly into a corner he cried out  "Why zounds Madam what

they went over the old matter of his being a strong object of GARRICK's  envy  This brought up GEORGE GARRICK and his attachment to his brother  'Have not you observed'  said one  'how anxiously he always attended to the minutest matters that he conceived would give pleasure to DAVIDin particular the nights he performed all must be as still as deathnot a mouse must stirwhile through  affection  to the BROTHER and  gratitude  to the FRIEND the worthy GEORGE was every where entreating persuading and threatening to induce all those who were behind the scenes to be silent Hushhushwas he every minute heard to say'  "Why if this be the case"  said another  "it is not wonderful DAVID should allow him so handsome a salary for it is plain he received it for  hush money  "  'His attachment to DAVID'  said another  'was exemplary what trouble he had in the business of KENRICK Do you know the story of the challenge'  "Not exactly"  said the first  'I will tell it you then'  said the other  'KENRICK wrote an infamous poem for which the world very justly held him in detestation GARRICK's first feelings in this business were pretty  vif  and he sent by  his brother  a message which he called a challenge GEORGE perhaps out of tenderness delivered it rather delicately and KENRICK taking advantage of this ambiguity made an equivocal reply to it GARRICK after this said he had challenged KENRICK and he would not meet him This being the general talk came to KENRICK's ears who sent GARRICK the following letter'  "SirAs I find you report that you sent me a challenge and that I have not spirit enough to meet youI now inform you that I received no sort of message from you but through YOUR BROTHER which was worded so doubtfully that added to his being  an  improper person  for the transaction of such a business I did not feel myself obliged to understand it in the light you  now  say it was meant To shew you however you have mistaken me I will finish the matter in two words You have a large fortune and no familyI have a large family and no fortuneIf therefore you will settle only three hundred a year on those I leave behindprovided you kill meI will not only fight YOU

can recollect will be welcome to the public  Yours C DIBDIN  Bristol    March    LETTER XCIII  THE CURTAIN DROPT  "  Men are but children of a larger growth  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  THESE anecdotes having received their due share of applause one of the actors run through a song which had just been put into his hand by the copist It was in the character of pantomine and ran thus  AIR  I've made to  marches  MARS descend  JUSTICE in  jigs  her scales suspend  MAGICIANS in  gavots  portend  And FURIES black wigs bristle  To  prestos  PALLAS' Aegis blaze  SNAKES twist to  fugues  a thousand ways  And JOVE whole towns with lightning raze  At sound of the  prompter's whistle  II  I've made a SUN of  polish'd tin  DRAGONS of  wood  with ghastly grin  A  canvas  SEA the which within  Did  leather  DOLPHINS caper  I've strung with  packthread  ORPHEUS'  lyre  Made SHEEP and OXEN dance with  wire  And have destroy'd with  painted  FIRE  GRAND TEMPLES of  cartridge paper  III  I've made a SWAIN his love asleep  Chide  warbling  BIRDS and  bleating  SHEEP  While he himself did bawling keep  Like boatman at a ferry  I've RACKS made that  no blood could spill  Foul POISON that could  do no ill  And DAGGERS QUEENS and PRINCES kill  Who are  alive  and  merry  In the same pantomime was a scene of a whimsical nature PIERROT is left at a tavern to watch out for HARLEQUIN who is expected there and told he may call for what he chuses If he wants any thing to eat he has but to say  what  and they will bring it to him If he would amuse himself he has only to say  how  and he may take his choice of entertainments And if he would chuse any sorts of wine he has nothing to do but say  which  and they will be instantly brought to him Having conned his lesson and beginning to get sleepy he wishes for a little dancing and singing to keep  him awake and hollows out  '  How  '  After he had repeated this word several times the waiter comes in asks him if he called and says he shall be very glad to wait upon him PIERROT repeats  '  How  '  The waiter answers in any way he pleases Thus the word  how  is played upon till PIERROT finding it procures him no amusement changes it to  what  which bawling out pretty powerfully the waiter thinks he is affronted and begins to apologize saying he plainly sees he has mistaken him being a foreigner but that he meant no offence There are good and bad of all countries PIERROT by this time tired of calling out  what  has recourse to his third expedient and cries louder than ever  '  Which  '  "Why all countries"  replies the waiter  '  Which  '  vociferates PIERROT At length the waitergetting nothing from him but  howwhatwhich  says  "why surely this fellow is either mad or drunk"  '  Which  '  says PIERROT  "Oh damme if I know  which  "  returns the waiter  "but I'll swear you are either one or t'other"  A repetition of this scene brought on an account of the plan of the pantomime itself It was constructedin the opinion of the actor who mentioned it and who had the confidence of the poetupon a very new and entertaining idea HARLEQUIN runs away with COLUMBINE the DOCTOR's wife and leaves his own wife HARLEQUINETTE in the DOCTOR's house These last two with their familiar spirits are through the whole business the pursuersbut their power being rather inferior to that of HARLEQUIN they obtain their wishes  figuratively  but not  literally  Thus HARLEQUINETTE dooms them in one place to  death and destruction  and the scene immediately changes to an apothecary's shop In another place she entreats her spirits to convey them to where they will be surrounded with  voracious animals  and instantly they find themselves at a LORD MAYOR's feast  This pantomime I put into the hands of the Drurylane managers a considerable while before  Harlequin Junior  came out at that theatre That piece has certainly some smack of mine and as Mr SHERIDAN spoke very handsomely of it to me in  Great Queenstreet  without mentioning its having the smallest similarity to any thing else it is not unfair to conclude that it furnished them with a hint since they did not perform my pantomime However I will not say it was their intention to reject it for before I knew their positive determinationwhich indeed might possibly have remained untold to this momentI withdrew it myself in conformity to my agreement at the  Circus  which precluded me from getting any piece performed elsewhere  I shall take this opportunity of mentioning that I sent a piece to Mr COLMAN through the  medium  of Mr WOODFALL called  The Wits  which was returned From this piece a whole scene was taken into the  Managers in Distress  almost literally Mr COLMAN may sayfor no man as may be seen by his works has read more French authorsthat the scene in question was borrowed from the FRENCH and therefore  fair game  but it may be retorted that it was  imitated  not  translated  and though the original will furnish a hint which any body has a right to take it is a very curious thing that two men should  imitate  a French author in almost the same words Besides the ingenuous way would have been at the time the piece was rejected to have given for a reason that there was already in his hands something on the same subject  They finished the subject of the pantomime by reading two of HARLEQUINETTE's songs which they found to be a tolerable burlesque of  operatical poetry  The first ran thus  AIR  Do but thy recollection jog  And thou wilt soon remember  That thou hast seen an English fog  In the dull month of November  At first 'twas thickbut changing soon  Red tips did clouds  bedizen  And ere the clock struck twelve at noon  All  smiling was the horizon  The other was as follows  AIR  No more of waves and winds the sport  Our

useless  SHROUDS  And WENCHES come aboard in  crowds  Pantomimes in general were now talked about and one of the actors gave an account of a Dutch one upon the subject of ABRAHAM and ISAAC ABRAHAM is on the point of offering up his son and having tied him to a stake he very leisurely takes out an old rusty horse pistol and measuring six paces with great deliberation presents his piece when all of a sudden he finds some wet descend into the pan and damp the powder when looking up he sees an angel in a certain attitude who had caused what he had mistaken for rain In the midst of ABRAHAM's consternation he cries out  Der traple Abram wilt ta te youncker slauken  In another scene there are a number of windmills which HARLEQUIN in the most  delicate  way that can be imagined  sets a going  Getting further into the subject of Dutch pieces they talked of their tragedies The famous  Cid  of CORNEILLE it seems is curiously translated for the edification of the  Mynheers  There is a wellknown passage in the play where the father of RODORIGO stimulates his son to revenge and not satisfied with the assurance he had before given him stopping him  BONNY KITTY  Moderato  When last from the straits we had fairly cast anchor  I went bonny Kitty to hail  With quintables stord for our voyage was a spanker  and bran new was every sail  But I knew well enough how with words sweet as honey  They trick us poor Tars of our gold  And when the sly Gipsies have  finger'd the money  And when the sly Gipsies have finger'd the money  And when the sly Gipsies have finger'd the money  The bag they give poor Jack to hold    So I chac'd her d'ye see my lads under false colours  Swore my wishes were all at end  That I'd sported away all my good looking dollars  And borrow'd my togs of a friend  Oh then had you seen her no longer my Honey  Twas Varlet audacious and bold  Begone from my fight now you've spent all your money  For Kitty the bag you may hold    With that I took out double handfulls of shiners  And scornfully bid her good bye  Twould have done your heart good had you then seen her fine airs  How she'd leer and she'd sob and she'd sigh  But I stood well the broadside while Jewel and Honey  She call'd me I put up the gold  And bearing away as I sack'd all the money  Left the bag for ma'am Kitty to hold  short he says  '  a tu un coeur Rodrigue  '  He replieswhich is surely very pointed  "  Tout autre che mon PereLe trouvera sur l'heure  The DUTCHMAN determined to be as  phlegmatic  as the FRENCHMAN was brilliant has rendered it thus  'Ap ye un  hart  RODRIGUE'  "  Yaw Papa  "  cries RODRIGUE  'Come come have done'  cried one  'with Dutch tragedies and let THRUM try this song for meit is in the character of a sailorthough upon second thoughts it is a little out of character too for the author makes him too cunning to be duped by his lass'  I will frankly own to you that I have introduced more into this greenroom scene than I ever gave in the READINGS but I thought it good matter for that situationbesides it has given me another opportunity of noticing an instance or two of theatrical conduct which I had before omitted Indeed if MANAGERS are to be considered as caterers for the PUBLIC and will buy  refuse  the better to snack a good handsome  market penny  it is but common justice to shew those who sit down to this  mental ordinary  how they are  crammed  and if afterwards they chuse to  swallow  it they have nobody to blame but themselves  I shall now drop the curtain on the actors and actresses from whose theatrical world in little we are furnished with a specimen of the childish pursuits of mankind at large  "Men are but children of a larger growth"  says DRYDENand so true is the remark that whether the TOY be a  crown  a  sceptre  a  ribbon  or a  rattle  the motive is the same and the pleasure proportionably  perfect One of my greatest pleasures which I will not call a  toy  because it has  reason  torecommendit is that which

praise of ill men being the most wounding of all satire And I particularly request all manner of persons whatsoever if they hear of any encomiums panegyrics or any sort of commendations paid me by men of the above description that they will have the liberality to consider such encomiums panegyrics or commendations as so many studied attempts to abuse and injure me and that they will in their charitable goodness treat them accordingly  At the same time I beg leave to recommend myself and this work to the kind attention and good wishes of the  worthy very few  who make the laws a benefit and a blessing to their fellow creatureswhose study is to spare to mediate and to consolewho poise the balance of justice so even that it may not  incline  in the estimation of a single hair while the

all manner of persons to attend as the only court where JUSTICE and EQUITY go hand in hand and therefore whose competency to determine they and I ought to acknowledge  I desire all managers and their adherents not to have the smallest uneasiness concerning me but to sleep perfectly at ease depending upon their alliances with the newspapers to blacken and confound those assertions of mine which they cannot controvert I advise them also not to put themselves to any inconvenience concerning the style and manner of their entertainments but since genius and judgment are not to be commanded jog on in the old way relying upon the goodnature of the English and the fecundity of their own imaginations in the art of puffing In their report of me I court their reprobation upon the same principle and for the same reason I do that of the lawyers I desire they will indulge themselves to the full extent of their wishes and in particular let them not fail to  cut  a great many JOKES and  let  a great many PUNS As to my future intentions I would wish them to believe that I am  not  going to INDIA but on the contrary that I shall by and by solicit to be received among them and I recommend them to enjoy in  contemplation  the slavery subjection and humiliation which they shall hereafter see me in and to meditate the most expedient modes of varying and continuing such treatment against the timewhich I would have them flatter themselves will arrive upon holding up a fingerwhen they shall have me again in their clutches And I entreat all and every person or persons to whose knowledge this subject may come if it so happen that nothing shall be advanced by way of answer to whatever I may have asserted to believein spite of the affected indifference such conduct may seem to conveythat it will be put on for no other reason than because my arguments are unanswerable and because an attempt to refute them would only shew the weakness of their cause but betray that secret envy which would operate equal to a confession of the truth  My next jubject will be the Reviewers a few twigs of whose critical rod at least I shall be able to break and if every writer had the same constancy that tremendous object that terrific hobgoblin which men of weak minds and slender intellects worshipas Indians do the devilout of fear would very soon appear a poor inoffensive thing engendered only by splenitive ideas and a contemplation of cobwebs in libraries Adieu  Yours C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER C  CRITICAL ANTICIPATION  "  Yes and you shall hear what I'll say to the justice of peace  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I THANK you for your fears because they arise from friendship but be assured they arise from a false view of the matter Tell me what you think when you have read the following letter  To the REVIEWERS  GENTLEMEN  I should be glad to know by what authority you take upon you to pronounce away the good name of those authors who come under the lash of your criticism or bid others rise into fame whose works have the transcendant advantage of your decree in their favour  If you are a chartered bodythough I never heard of any power competent to confirm such establishmentand have an exclusive right to exercise laws not cognizable by other courts of criticism I have only to lament that in a country like this there should be a literary inquisition for as no persuasion is so likely to breed schisms as the study of letters so every man's opinion may by the exercise of very slender abilities be construed into critical heterodox for which impietyshould it really appear that he is amenable to your jurisdiction  what racks and slow fires may not be dreaded on the first day of every month when you regularly celebrate your  aute de se  Being an Englishman therefore I call upon all others to protestas I do myself upon this present occasionagainst the competency of your power having no scruple to declare that as wounding the mind is a torture of a much more exquisite nature than lacerating the body so the cruelties you practise are as reprehensible a violence on erudition as those of SPAIN or PORTUGAL were on religion I know your advocates have thrown out to palliate the matter that you wound with  blunt  arrows which in my opinion is an aggravation of your inhumanityfor every body knows the  keenest  weapon inflicts the least pain  I have often laughed at the susceptibility of literary men concerning your criticisms Some have gnashed their teeth and imputed all you have said to ENVY which as far as my humble judgment serves me does not appearfor by the little I have seen your temperaments are too frigid to admit of any such tingling passion Others have been ready to burst while they swore they endured their torture with all the intrepidity and resolution of primitive Americans In short the sensibility of all is in some degree wounded and every one threatens you with a cutting answerwhich he dares not write  On these occasions my constant advice is not to read you at all and then you might as well have not written at all for if the writer himself be not hurt the rest of the world find in you only what they expected and after your reviews have wrapt up stuff black pins or pectoral lozenges or been appropriated to other useswhich if they were written to mortify unfortunate authors are at least as worthy as those for which they were designedyou are as little regarded as any other temporary casualty which excites our wonder today and tomorrow is forgotten  Some however look into you upon the principle of the man who wants to be taken upin hopes of being abused COLLEY CIBBER used to tell his son that so he contrived to let the world speak of him it did not matter what it said and as far as it relates to you I look upon this maxim of his to be much about the fact But lest you should imagine I affect all this carelessness in the moment I am under the keenest apprehensions as to what you may chuse to say relative to this TOUR I'll put the certainty of my enjoying the very tranquillity I describe so fareven beyond  your  power to doubt or reason awaythat you shall in this instance at least confessthose who review the imperfections of others do not always appear the most perfect upon a review themselves  When a prejudice has taken root in an early mind it is pretty difficult to remove itespecially when planted by  reason  and strengthened by  experience  Eighteen years ago I wrote a piece called  The Wedding Ring  and so much did I dread the reviewers that in the most irresolute state I walked up and down GEORGE's  coffee house  with a review in each hand for a considerable time without the courage to open either of them At length plucking up spirits I sneaked into the most obscure corner I could find and was presently lifted into ecstacy by reading as nearly as I can remember the following words  "This piece is an imitation of  Il Filosofo di Campagna  It is done into English by Mr DIBDIN who has improved on the original and rendered it a very pleasing entertainment"  Having swallowed with avidity these  "honey words"  I began to think if I were to fortunate in my first search that probably on a second I should still have greater reason to rejoice and like a man who instead of quietly pocketing the money for a twenty pound prize in the lottery leaves it behind for a ticket which comes up a blank I was determined to stand another literary chance regardless of what might be the consequence  Upon opening the other review I found these words or at least perfectly the sense of them  "This piece which is taken from  Il Filosofo di Campagna  has very little to recommend it to the notice of the public'tis much inferior to the original and Mr DIBDIN has no pretensions upon this occasion to think himself capable of furnishing an agreeable entertainment to the public"  I have already said that this happened eighteen years ago therefore I will not swear to the  letter  of these articles to the  spirit  however I do most peremptorily It had as strong an effect upon me as being introduced behind the curtain of a jugler or a puppetshewman and so completely was I in the secret that I made a resolution which I have ever since religiously kept not to read a single review of any thing I should write from that moment As therefore I pique myself upon acknowledging obligations I desire you will accept my sincerest thanks for grubbing up by the root as it were all those mortifications which on reading that abuse sure to be levelleddeservedly or undeservedlyat public characters I might have felt in common with other men for to the detection of the inconsistency recorded above I owe my never having answered in my whole life a single printed calumny unless it has been of so injurious a nature that it could not be passed over and then I have constantly signed my name Whatever you say therefore of this TOUR will be unread by meI advise you however to look to your own consistency and properly to do so it will not hurt you if you peruse the following letter to my reverend friend which will treat wholly of general criticism  I am Gentlemen Your obedient servant C DIBDIN  And my dear friend I am  Yours Most faithfully C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER CI  A CRITICAL EXAMINATION  "  Asham'd she marks the passage with a blot  "  And hates the line where candour was forgot  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  IT has often been allowed that the talents for a  writer  and a  critic  are distinct and separate If by this it be meant that the knack of finding fault is easier than the capacity to invent and improve the position is a fair one but this would prove mere cavilling to be true criticism which I will not admit The truth is no man can with the proper degree of perspicuity feeling and tenderness analyze the work of a writer  but a writer  and all those who poach for errors and take away imperfections without the ability to leave beauties in their place are not real judges of what they arrogate a right to decide on and consequently ought not to be entitled critics  In this light perhaps the matter has not always been seen and yet it is the only one which will give it its true colour Modern criticism is like looking at the sun to discover only the  spots  while the  servour  and  brilliancy  of  his lustre  are disregarded but ought an ingenious and enlightened age to pay the effusions of such folly a moment's attention No Let the decisions upon works of genius come from men who possess congenial sentiments these only are qualified for the task and will be most likely to treat with candour and delicacy that which they know the pain and labour of producing and look with  care and circumspection before they venture to wound those parts in others which upon fair inspection they may find vulnerable in themselves  I will not say should personal enmity or rooted difference of opinion interfere that severity in place of lenity will not sometimes be adopted Men are fallible and a bold and flowing pen is a tempting instrument to accelerate the dictates of revenge but even then they will always remember that their antagonists can weild the same weapon and for the world's improvement 'tis well such conflicts are the  loss of victory  is some triumph in a noble contest I know not whether KING JOHN of FRANCE waited on by the BLACK PRINCE is not almost at that moment as much an object of envy as his ILLUSTRIOUS CONQUEROR  I am clearly of opinion that if literary works were to appear only before such a tribunal the press would be more employed and the amendment have this operation dawning merit would be fostered mature abilities stimulated to a repetition of their exertions and what would be equally a public benefit  pretenders  would be at once  silenced  whereas thanks to  reviews newspapers  and  pamphlets  men of real talents are deterred from ornamenting the world with their productions and the dull vapid offspring of insipidity and ignorance puffed into fame Let me beseech therefore all those who read weigh and approve these reasons to prescribe for themselves the following simple and efficient rule  When any man decries a work of genius let him be asked if he can do as well or if his opinions be public let enquiry be made as to his  own productions  and do not let him be credited unless something be found equal in consequence as to every literary requisite to the work he undertakes to criticise  As to pointing out mere inaccuracies it is not more invidious and contemptible than it is an affront to the reader by whom these critical gentlemen chuse to act in the quality of schoolmaster besides there cannot be a higher compliment to him they would affect to condemnfor it both implies that his FAULTS are  trifles  and his MERIT  beyond the reach of their capacity  The observations here made have this drift I do not know that from any body a volume of this size would be more considered as a piece of consummate arrogance than from myself and when it is understood that I have presumed to speak plainly of popular subjects and advanced decided sentiments which were they to obtain would go to the correction at least of several favourite follies I know not where the clamour may stop Should it be very loud however I shall beg leave of the candid and ingenuous to enquire  who  are clamourous and if it turn out to be the very men whose impositions on the public are the objects of my reprehension every one whose opinion I have a legitimate right to value will rank on my side and then let us see whether an army of critical malecontents will stand any chance with such a phalanx  Nothing in nature is so easy as to find fault  Bright geniuses  as naturally breed  critics  as the  sun  engenders  flies  Who has fed more grubs than Dr JOHNSON  One of these was congratulating another on some recent success when he was answered  "Oh this is nothing at allstay till I do the Dictionary"  "Why surely"  said the other  "you would not have the impudence to attack thatno no he's safe there"  'Aye how so'  "Why he has given the real etymology of all words from every authority he could gather"  'God'  said the critic  'I did not know that  for I never read it  but if that is the case it won't do sure enoughfor what  every body says  MUST BE TRUE'  therefore let the witlings take care for they may be assured in proportion as they are abusive so they will lift me into consequence  Yet will I by way of caution to the judicious say a few words If when I am gone it should be advanced that any of my assertions are false let  the manner of my making them be considered the proofs I adduce examined and the ground of their probability looked into  If it be said that while I reprobate criticisms I arrogate the title of critic myself thereby insinuating that I have a right to rank with the only description which according to my idea are competent to decide on works of literature I beg to say that mine are not  criticisms  but mere  observations  and that they do not go to the correction of  errors  but  abuses  For instance What does all I say of Mr SHERIDAN amount to but that he could have written and invented much better and probably would have done so had he not conceived that if he had outgone WYCHERLY and CONGREVE he would have been gazed at as a  comet  and then lost whereas his business was to move like a  planet  in the regular course of periodical revolution  If it be remarked that I  irregularly bred  according to my own confessionin the school of music have presumed to hold forth a rod for the correction of public tastewhich has been formed by the combined excellence of men whose abilities have received universal admirationlet it be remembered that I only wish to prune the luxuriant and superfluous branches off this  tree of taste  and throw away the  rotten  and  withered fruit  that so it may produce  vigorously  that  quantity  it is capable of bearing giving it  beauty maturity  and  flavour  My next will contain a discussion of these matters in a lighter way by the end of which I shall have pretty well anticipated all objections in a literary point of viewexcept my general errata which I reserve for the last letter but one Adieu I shall soon have done  subscribing myself  but never  being  Yours Most faithfully C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER CII  MORE ANTICIPATION  "  Do not be too servile neither  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  IT has been frequently considered by authors as a sufficient apology for the incongruity of their works that they were written in a hurrywhich by the way is the last excuse that ought to be made Is it done to give an idea that the public will swallow any thing be it ever so crude or immature Or would they seem to say See what an excellent composition I have given you in so short a timewhat would it have been if I had taken  pains  about it  How unfortunate am I then who am obliged to offer this hacknied excuse for the crudities that are to be found in this book which has been written in a greater hurry than ever book was A friend of mine was firmly of opinion that I should be at least a twelvemonth in getting it out from the first day I began to print and I really may venture to affirm that so much  ground of argument  and  English ground  have never been gone over together in so short a time but I will not be so unfair however as to avail myself of this opportunity of getting off but honestly confess that though I have chosen a pretty extensive field I do not think I could have explored it to better purpose had I taken ever so much timefor I have put up plenty of game and to have gone  over all the shiftings and doublings would perhaps have rendered the chace tedious instead of amusing  To speak literally I might have expressed myself with more variety and closer accuracy than I have done but  correctness  is with me a  cold word  and if a revision of any thing take away of  spirit  more than it add of  elegance  let me go into the world with whatever faults the critics can point out so that men of strong feeling and candid discrimination will but acknowledge in me lively fancy decent language poignant remark apt epithet and argument something like axiom  As times go the art of keeping people awake has its merit and if I can but accomplish this I shall have triumphed over many writers and thosenot to speak it profanelythat I have heard praised too who believing that a man takes up a book to shun his thoughts the more effectually to obliviate themif they literati will admit my expressionseem as if they invented a sort of literary laudanum which should set him asleep without an obligation to the apothecary  The temperatures of all authors are not alike Some only muddy and confound their ideas by frequent thinkinglike the actor who reproved by RICH for being imperfect on the  fiftythird  night of the  Beggar's Opera  cried out  "Good God sir would you have a man remember a thing for ever"  Others catch hold of superficial ideas which leave no perceptible trace in the mind any more than a  meteor  in the air these though beautiful in the conception come to nothing upon proof They are as absurd as would be a specimen of a fine hand writing in vitriol which would be lost upon being committed to paper and destroy that which it solicited to embellish  I shall be blamed by some for introducing so much figurebut I own I love imagery and where description is necessaryparticularly in the latitude  of epistolary writing which it will be pretty difficult I believe to square by any rule as to its mode of languageI see no reason why this powerful literary auxiliary should not be called in to the assistance of  prose  as well as  poetry  ADDISON writes on the pleasures of the imagination as critically exact and in language as correctly chaste as he introduces WILL WHIMBLE or SIR ROGER DE COVERLY's rookeryall which is perfectly laudable as far as it relates to establishing a reputation for a just and accurate style but surely if he had been a little more volatile and stretched a point to have given us a glowing description or two on a subject so full of inspiration it would not have hurt but rather lent assistance to that sober solemnity which throughout his whole writings partakes a little too much of his Spectatorial taciturnityBut it was his waylike the gravity of the BATH audience or CERVETTO's  yawn  and this granted 'tis not impossible but that praise which POPE thought was meant to  damn  it was so faintconveyed or was intended to do so as warm an encomium as the frigidor rather elegantconception of the writer was capable of admitting  For this reason I think DRYDEN's prose is the best in our languagefor though yet  prose  it has all the fire strength and imagination of  poetry  Yet cannot I quit this subject without noticing how much I admire the wonderful ease of SWIFT I would indeed go through a list of all those who have delighted me but that I hasten very fast to a finish of my journey and cannot stay to bait on the road however agreeable may be the fare provided for me and because by the side of their superior productions mine would shew like a simple  field flower  compared to the beauty and richness of a variegated  parterre  You however prize it and for that and a thousand other reasons I remain  Most sincerely yours C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER CIII  A CURSORY RECAPITULATION  "  There I gave it her home brother Bruin  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I Have this moment finished reading for the first time in a collected state all the letters that are at present printed and instead of a general recapitulation of the whole matter which I thought would be positively necessary so well is the proper connection preservednotwithstanding the manifest disadvantages I have laboured underthat I shall only have occasion to rub off hardnesses and throw in some finishing touches to make this picture have a proper roundness and harmony in its general effects  I have said early in the work that I expected to leave ENGLAND in the beginning of  April  which it was certainly my firm determination to accomplish had it been eligibly practicable but I will candidly declare that when I found should I do so I must have gone abroad in a more unpleasant way thanI thank my  able  and  willing  friendsI am now likely to do I thought I might take the liberty of altering my intentionespecially as I can now make so desirable an apology to those who wish me well which number I am sure is in a multiplied state and by  no mean figure  since I have had it in my power to tell my own story  It was my intention to have gone into the laws respecting the regulations of public entertainments but as that business has not only been argued on in every possible way but at length taken the very form I long ago predicted it would a further investigation of what is passed were totally unnecessary I shall take the liberty however to offer a few words as to what may come of it and mention how in my sense the matter ought to be And first it would be but common policy to introduce into the new bill how the amusements are to be regulated beyond the circle of twenty miles out of LONDON for I can assure Mr MAINWARING that the proprietors of  Theatres Royal  in the country begin to grow very jealous of their privileges and if they should form a mistaken zeal orwhat is full as likelywith an eye to their own advantage put down all the  Unlicensed Theatres  or indeed should any indifferent personnow the laws are explaineddo so for the reward there is not an actor out of LONDON who would not starve for it is not by the  Theatres Royal  where they have a large rent a number of servants and heavy nightly expences to pay but by the snug comfortable returns and reasonable disbursements that a scheme of this kind maintains itself YORK is sure to lose money but LEEDS and WAKEFIELD never fail to bring the company up again In short let the matter be equalizedlet men without respect of persons who pay a sum of money and give security have licences which may be of various prices according to the nature of the entertainment meant to be given This would exclude all possibility of monopoly stimulate men of talents to exert themselves and make the name of  Actor  and why it should not be so no man upon earth can give a sensible reasonRESPECTABLE It might also ultimately contribute towards the exigencies of the state and by a general regulation be made like the amusements in FRANCE of national consequence Mr SHERIDAN has I know held out that it would not be productive but the matter was not at that time pressed otherwise there can be no doubt but he would have seen to the contrary for it can be proved without difficulty that public amusements would yield as a tax forty thousand pounds a year He has also talked lately that it would be a hardship were the privileges of the  TWO  Theatres  as if they were guaranteed by patents to the exclusion of all others  should be trenched upon  for they are a property worth little less than two hundred thousand pounds This is  speculatively  TRUE but  substantially  FALSEbut if it were literally the fact there is not the smallest equity in this mode of argument The  Royalty Theatre  or the  Circus  cost as large a sum  originally  as either  DruryLane  or  Covent Garden Theatre  and if the  wardrobe scenes  and other articles have swelled the property to such an immense sumwhich by the bye is a little extraordinary for the last time they were put up to sale one yielded but sixty and the other seventy thousand poundsis it  money  or  success  that has produced it  But to ask what this boasted property is worth stript of the patent is the only way to know its intrinsic value in which case I believe we should find that the trappings would be about equal to the mock honours of the actor who wears them that ninetenths of the scenes have been considered only as so much spare wood and canvas ever since the tragedy opera or pantomime they embellished was damned or finished its run and the gilt chariots plumed caps spears shields and all that waste of spangles and gilt leather that make processions stared atthrown by to crowd up the flies or encumber the propertyroom In short to render Mr SHERIDAN's meaning so as to make it consonant to common sense is to suppose he says this We had a large  ideal  property which you  realized  by giving us a power to exercise our trade of which that property is the  working tools  if you give these people an equal power their property will be as large as oursand this is not fair WhyShall one merchant entreat government to prohibit the commerce of another lest he also should grow rich Nolet each do his utmost 'tis for the general good Thus will a laudable emulation stimulate them to industry and a watchfulness over each other prevent mutual abuses  The sensible part of the world set down public amusements as ruined when Mr SHERIDAN and Mr HARRIS coalesced and the short time that monopoly  went on confirmed this truth so strongly that it was clearly demonstrable a petition for the emancipation of  theatrical slaves  would soon have been full as necessary as those at present preferred in favour of the  Africans  I profess to be a little  au fait  to this matter and therefore it must not to  me  be objected that more than two public places cannot subsist in LONDON at the same time Have not houses at an immense price been purchased to be pulled downhas not invention been racked to prop the crazy walls and roofs of the  two theatres  till they have been stretched into the size of  four  and has not this expence been repaid first by laying an additional charge on the benefits of authors and actorswhich were first sixty guineas afterwards eighty and now an hundredand then ten fold by the receipts of first nights which as the  theatre  is sure to fill must of course pay all the expence of a first performance whether it succeed or not which clearly proves the manager is safe whatever may be the fate of the poor author In fact ten places of public entertainment might in the metropolis thrive supported by  real merit  and  proper variety  for that wonderful place has grown more rich and populous every day since the establishment of the present  theatres  But were this to obtain there would be an actual necessity for calling in the assistance of men of real abilities who will not after the treatment they have received lend their help without being properly rewardedand this would overthrow the whole of the present system for it is evident the  theatre  can as it is yield money enough without the smallest aid of genius or ability at all  There are but two thingseither let the management of  theatres  be considered as a traffic that every body has a right to derive a benefit from who chuses to adventure in it or let it be understood as a grant to the proprietors of  two houses  in LONDON and if you will one in every other city or opulent town in the kingdom who are to be considered as the purveyors of the public and obliged under that idea to provide the best entertainment that can be had How will it operate No single  theatre  in the kingdom except those in LONDON  produces the smallest noveltyif therefore performances void of merit are permitted at the  two theatres  they go through the whole nation and are sure the source being contaminated to poison the general taste Thus geniusfor whose support and encouragement  theatres  were surely originally intendedmay retire unknown and neglected to deplore the ingratitude of the most benevolent country upon earth  Had I time to go over the ground of establishing theatres by purchaseable licences I should not despair of proving that it would answer every desirable end to the managers the public and the legislature but since at present however the subject does not seem likely to take this turn I shall content myself with sayingas more cannot be meant by vesting partial powers in the hands of individuals than that such men should act in conformity with the wish and properly provide for the  pleasure  of the publicthis law like any other should be watched and managers laid under a restriction not to reject works of acknowledged merit For this purpose a sort of board of controul might be instituted who should have power to take cognizance of every omission of this kind and let the authority of that body determine in what way pieces should be produced so as to conduce to the mutual advantage of author and manager If it be objected that the cure is worse than the evil it selfevidently proves that the measure is in itself wrong and that the legislature by giving an unlimitted power to managers will check that genius it is their duty to encourage and cherish that very licentiousness they are so solicitous to curb  In a word as the laws now are a managereither from want of principle or abilitybeing absolute may exercise what tyranny he shall think proper I therefore hope for the sake of consistency this power will be in some way restrained if it were only for the  propriety  of not countenancing  despotism  in a LAND OF FREEDOM Adieu  Yours with great truth C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER CIV  MORE ACCOUNT OF MATTER BROUGHT UP  "  Is it in the newspaper I don't like that  "  Now I dofor then 'tis likely it mayn't be truth  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  HAVING done with the theatresto which subject I wish I could have allotted more room I proceed to my task of looking further over those parts of the work which may need elucidation and others that may with propriety be revived in order to be heightened  I have said that I should be able to point out many errors in Mr PATERSON's Travelling Dictionarywhich is certainly in many places incorrect I have shewn how I calculated falsely all the way from BURY to WORCESTER owing to the faith I gave to that book From HALIFAX to SHEFFIELD which according to Mr PATERSON is  forty miles  is really no more than  thirtysix  from SHEFFIELD to MANCHESTER said to be  forty  miles is  fortytwo  from MANCHESTER to LIVERPOOL set down  forty  miles is but  thirtysix  from LEEDS to HALIFAX said to be  sixteen  miles is  eighteen  from HALIFAX to MANCHESTER set down  thirty  is but  twentyeight  and indeed there are many other errors of the like kind  I shall next take an opportunity of mentioning which I look upon as common justice that long after the letter was printed containing an explanation  of the business between Mr DALY the Irish manager and myself the note of ten pounds was paid This however I had no notice of till I received a letter at LIVERPOOL mentioning it on the eighth of March lastmaking very nearly a twelvemonth from the time of the original transaction but I do not yet repent of noticing it in the way I have for the pieces which are far more valuable are not to this moment returned  At the latter end of the  twentyfirst  letter I have mentioned leaving my kind friends at COLCHESTER before I have actually been therethis arose from writing the twentysecond letter  first  Or the reader may if he please believe that I purposely left myself this opportunity of recurring to a circumstance which will certainly ever furnish me with grateful reflections the fact is however as I have set it down  I have to speak of newspapers and the first thing I shall say is that it is astonishing to see how they multiply I remember when  The Daily Advertiser The Public Advertiser The Gazetteer The Ledger  and two evening papers made upexcept  The Craftsman  on a Saturdaythe whole stock of public prints in LONDON and  one  or at most  two  papers  in a county  contented the people in the country and really at that time there was something like independent principles in the conduct of the public prints  The Morning Chronicle  even outwent this and for a few years was conductedparticularly as to theatrical stricturesupon the most disinterested and impartial plan that ever was characterized by candour and fearless truth but alas what force of abilities and integrity can hold out against free tickets countenance attention compliments and in fact an anticipation of every little pleasurable wish and convenience But TROY fell and so did  The Morning Chronicle  which having first implicitly bowed to the mandate of managers to finish the business took a decided part in politics and is now  decidedly  NOWHERE  The Morning Post  blazed on us at onceit attacked every thing and seared nothingconsequently its popularity was very soon confirmed This paper  is memorable for teaching advertisers how to write and what  Puff  says in the  Critic  has certainly its origin from the superior style in which auctions were advertised in  The Morning Post  which set every body mad for highflown paragraphical descriptions of trifles for as FOOTE has it they had as much to say upon a  ribband  as a RAPHAEL The dauntless attacks however were its staple commodity its stamina through which it presently grew vigorous and rich At this time thinking I suppose that abuse alone was necessary to lift a public print into popularity a set of levelling gentlemen brought out  The General Advertiser  which to be sure did deal about sheer mud and filth in a most liberalor rather illiberalway without regard to sex age or condition Having however forgot that the satire in the  Morning Post  was written in the style of a  gentleman  and though very severe gave evident marks of genius and conveyed good strength of argument they presently found themselves decried among all those who had ability to judge or taste to distinguish Yet as in this country are to be found plenty of those who love to feast now and then on a neighbour's reputation this worthy paper though full of nothing but the grossest and most ignorant scurrilitywhich accomplished quality it retains to this very daybecame a great favourite among the lower sort of people  I shall go through a remainder of this subject in my next letterbeing the last but two on which I shall trouble the public or telling you except privately how much I am  Your very obliged friend C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER CV  MORE NEWS  "  How are we ruined  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  THUS did the newspapers with all the calmness and goodnature imaginable revile abuse and vilify each other by mutual agreement for a considerable time without receiving the smallest interruption to their laudable endeavours  At length some of the underlings belonging to the  Morning Post  headed by that renowned veteran DOCTOR KENRICKresolving to have a  Morning Post  of their own without any previous intimation came out all of a sudden with a new paper under that title This scheme was as expeditiously stopt as it was ridiculously put into practice The malecontents however were continually fomenting disputes till thinking themselves equal to the conduct of the paper without assistance from their principal they proposed terms of separation which were handsomely and honourably acceded to and the establishment of  The Morning Herald  was the consequence which is now without doubtexcept in that virulent and disgraceful party heat which some have not spared to think is a convention with the  Morning Post  to make both popularis the most brilliant paper extant indeed how should it be otherwise when in addition to the keen and penetrating judgment and solid good sense  of its fabricator it is notorious that the flower of the opposition have at times made it the conveyance of their public sentiments  After they had gone on in this manner for a time gathering strengthlike ANTEUS by being abased  The Universal Register  now called  The Times  was produced

declineit circulated pretty well  Last of all came out  The World  of which paper I shall not say an unkind word if it be only for its sensible and steady attachment to that most noble and manly of all subjectsthe virtues of THE PRINCE OF WALES Certainly it was stimulated to this theme by an act of public justice unparalelled in the annals of any country for is there an instance upon recordworthy equal attention to thiswhere the heir of such a glorious crown with a ripened wisdom and Spartan greatness of soul  at twenty  preferred to see his palace in ruins rather than his tradesmen should go unpaid There are no words adequate to the praise of such an action Admiration must tell it It must be feltnay it  is  in that uniform heartfelt transport with which men gaze on their idol who gave them so early a proof that he is not more a  munificent prince  than an HONEST MAN  It would not be credited were it not as evident as light that these NINE papers are so pampered with success that though advertisementswhich are charged equally at the stampofficeare now rated from five and sixpence to fourteen or fifteen shillings they garble  what  they think proper disappoint  when  they think proper and advertise for  whom  they think proper In short the very end proposed in advertising is defeated by their shameful neglect or scandalous perversion of what is committed to their care  This it seems has roused a number of opulent and respectable men who having themselves sustained great inconvenience from such kind of conduct are now at an immense expence and with a spirit hitherto unequalled bringing out a paper to be called  The Star  This paper will be out before what I am now writing can be read and this TOUR will finally go to press before this  Novel Hesperus  will have made its appearance therefore I cannot at any rate give more than a blind judgment on the business It will however be fair to conclude that the immense property the gentlemen engaged in this undertaking are able to musterwhich is an ingredient by the bye never yet possessed by the establishers of a new public printwill certainly if they go the right way to work render their undertaking a very popular one It has one novelty to recommend it it will be published  every evening  and if their source of intelligence be genuine and within themselves and they can in consequence anticipate the articles of the following day it will really become a very valuable acquisition to the public Some amendment most assuredly has long been wanted and by the easiest assent in the world they may rise to the summit of their wishesfor it consists of nothing more than to avoid the errors of the other daily prints which are so glaring that it is not only those who run may  read  but those who run may  correct  I shall not speak of  evening papers  for they are a sort of moons to the others and it would be only to  reflect  a  reflection  In the whole there are in LONDONtaking in the three Sunday papersabout twenty under different titlesall which yield prodigious profit indeed more individually than when there were but  four  which I think is a pretty conclusive proof that an increase of theatres would be proportionally productive  In the country where several fortunes have been made by newspapers alone there are I should suppose  ten  for every  one  that was to be seen  twentyfive years ago  and the short history of them in general is this They are indefatigable to procure entertaining and useful intelligence till they fill with advertisements and then a pair of scissars become the editor which are indiscriminately brandished by  compositors  and  devils  to the great annoyance of  Lloyd's Evening Post  and the unmerciful mutilation of the  St James's Chronicle  Some exceptions however there are to this rule and the strongest I know by infinite degrees is  The Sheffield Register  I do not know how soon my friend GALES may make a fortune which ultimately must inevitably happen if unwearied industry fair dealing the world's regard and a well stocked head as well as shop are the materials to procure it but let it happen when it will I shall change my good opinion of himwhich is at present pretty strongly rootedif he so far forget his patrons the public as to neglect them in return for their favours I think however he will not and so much do I approve his paper that I have made choice of it to announce what will publicly be known of me in future and I here conformably to such resolution give notice that nothing relative to me is to be considered as authentic but what shall appear in or through the medium of  The Sheffield Register  There may be other matters which are yet untouched if so in that state they must remain leaving it to the goodnature of my readers to overlook what in my haste I may have omittedwhile I make use of the little time I have to draw up a general correction of errors in minuter matters  Adieu My next letter though necessary will be tedious I shall endeavour thereforein the way of a story or a song on a tiresome journeyto enliven it with a few remarks not forgetting however first to remark that I am as usual  Yours very truly C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER CVI  A GENERAL ERRATA  "  All offences my Lord come from the heart  "  Never came any from mine  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I Had a great mind not to write this letter but there is something so easy in me that I may be persuaded into any thing What I am about to set down is a candid exposition of all the errors this book containswhich being given in a new way I may perhaps from some be credited for having committed these faults on purpose to introduce  novelty  even in my very ERRATA  One reason for my wish to say nothing about it was that the ingenuous part of my readers when they meet with a typographical mistake will have the goodness andwhat is better in the reading of a bookthe  good sense  to believe that the best substitute for the improper word their invention could supply was the very individual expression meant by the author  A second reason was that it would really be a pity to deprive the critical fry of a little nibblingwho live upon the errors of the press as young trouts do upon May flies till by and by the insects are all gone when searching for their prey with the usual avidity they get  hooked  for their pains  I had many others but the most substantial was that my modesty would become the sacrifice in such a trialfor if I say any thing about it at all common justice will oblige me to pronounce that this book though abounding with  errors  is the most PERFECT that ever was published  Having so far dipped into this subject as to have been guilty of an apparent solecism my reputation demands that I should set the matter to rights relying therefore on the candour of the public I blush and go on  Nothing can controvert that assertion which affirms that comparison is the only criterion by which any thing ought to be judged let it then be considered that when this book was first begun I had not the smallest idea what form it would take that I have been three thousand miles to search for the matter with which it is furnished that it was utterly impracticable I should myself superintend more than the first sixtyfour pages that I have not had recourse to a document of any kindnot even my own letters of which it was impossible to write or keep a copy that during the whole time till my last arrival in TOWN I had on my mind the weight of performing a most laborious entertainmentperhaps four times a week that I have been under the necessity of accepting a great number of invitations that in the course of the time I have not written so few as five hundred private letters let all this I say be put against the advantages which attend the productions of writers in general in their way to the world and then try by what degree of comparison this work is more or less perfect than any other 'Tis CLEARand  every  reader has given it in my favour confessing that instead of so small a number of errors 'tis wonderful there are not twenty times as many Every reader Yes My friends have  proclaimed  it and my enemies cursed me bit their lips and  owned  it  in secret  I shall begin with those errors which are of the greatest magnitudebut these are not typographical The language in many places is not sufficiently  perspicuous and frequently aiming at strengthfor I hate any thing lukewarmI am afraid I have been now and then a little uncouth in my style  The errors of the press are at least twothirds of them chargeable to me In the first place I writeespecially when imagination is hard at worka most  villainous hand  and as more than threefourths of the copy has gone letter after letter by the post there was nothing for it but to print awayin doing which Mr GALES has proved himself possessed of no mean abilities at decyphering But I'll go over the errors in the order they happened  The first p is a very curious one for it describes LIVERPOOL to be  east  of LEEDS Nine out of ten however upon reading it would have said this is an error of the press it should be  west  P l it will easily be credited that I meant to say the dean and chapter of LICHFIELD were  providently  repairing their cathedraland not  providentially  P l dele  in  before  conduct  for it should read the men who conduct those passage boats P l read on the stageand not on  to  the stage P l read POLLARDand not HOLLAND Same page last line but two dele  much  and read on being a MAN as well as a MONARCH This ought to be set right for it is that trait of his character on which our most gracious sovereign prides himself P l Here is a mistake occasioned without a doubt by some omission of mine How I intended to express myself at that moment it is totally out of my power at this distance of time to say but the passage will read tolerably well if the reader will entirely omit the words  "then to say that"  After all there is some whim in this kind of errata for it lookswholly without intention howeverlike a satire on the amendments of motions in the  house of commons  P l read of a more  sane  natureand not  sape  In the letter to Mr HARRIS to say I did not mean to say  more privater  though it might have been in the style of some of his people is unnecessary therefore the reader will please to dele  more  and let  privater  stand alone P l place a  comma  after  arguments  and put a  period  to  theatre  l Read  level  instead of  head  l same page P l for  when  read  where  P l read accommodating the melody  to  the capacity of the trumpets  Jack in the wood  read  Jack in thy mood  Every body knows it 'tis a speech of MERCUTIO P l for  sconce  read  nonce  P l read  der tiple  instead of  der traple  P in the motto of a few of the copies  The vizor speaks the art  instead of  heart  P last line but one  expose  not  explore  false charms P l after the word  dangers  add  scars  P l instead of  recommendation to passengers  read  accommodation to passengers  In the note P instead of  prevailed  read  having prevailed  P In the account of GARRICK's manoeuvres relative to the  Jubilee  it should be  "he raised a prodigious number of volunteers whose exertions he pretty liberally  exacted  "  not  extracted  In the song from  Poor Vulcan  read  quinze  not  quince  P last line but one instead of  wish safe  read  wish me safe  P last line but one instead of  only  read  not only  P read  auto de fe  not  aute de fe  P l instead of  if they literati  read  if the literati  There are other errors of less note such as  sensecutive  instead of  consecutiveinvetend  instead of  inventeddiving  instead of  driving  a  the  to be taken out before  theatresubtel  instead of  subtlewhetever  instead of  whereeverseviture  instead of  serviteurpbojector  for  projector  ABURNOT instead ARBUTHNOT and perhaps a few others  The pointing also has in some places altered the sense and perhaps a turned letter or two will now and then be met with in return however for all these imperfections the work is beautifully printed the letter is new and clean the lines are leaded that they may be read without confusion and the pressworkwhich is no trifle in a large publicationcarefully and nearly executed Indeed so much solicitude has Mr GALES shewn in the getting out this work and real judgment and understanding in being able to conduct it under such circumstances that he has as usual anticipated my praise by letting his labour  speak his panegyric I do not know what degree of influence my recommendation of him may have but if his mode of treating others be equally obligingand there is no reason to doubt it for I am sure my pretensions to a preference are slight indeedhe will  recommend  HIMSELF which it must be confessed is a very enviable style of patronage  Before I quit this  comedy  or  farce of errors  if you please I must not omit to set one very material matter to rights in doing which however it will appear that we were obliged to manoeuvre now and then and pretty ingeniously to get out this TOUR through the medium of the general post  When I went last from SHEFFIELD to LIVERPOOL the matter then written went no farther than Letter which the reader will see is dated SHEFFIELD March As I well knew the hospitality I should find at LIVERPOOL on my return and the variety of pleasures that would be kindly chalked out for me I felt myself conscious that to keep pace with Mr GALES would be no easy matter We therefore agreed that as soon as Letter should be finished to go on upon Letter which begins  The Readings  as instead of  inventing  I should in that case have nothing to do but  copy  Thus we calculated that there would be a vacancy of thirty lettersa number sufficient to contain all that it would be necessary to say on the TOUR itself and the statement of pieces We outreckoned ourselves however two ways In the first place in bringing up the matter to page instead of or we found ourselves entangled with an odd quarter of a sheet and were thus obliged to have duplicates of the  pages  and though the  matter  will be found different This will all be clearly understood by noticing that Letter is dated as above SHEFFIELD March Letter which begins  The Readings  is dated LIVERPOOL March Letter which finishes  The Readings    s dated LONDON March and Letter which returns again to the main subject is dated LONDON March  The advantage of this manoeuvre superadded to that which I have already mentioned was  supposed to be  that I should be able to superintend all that remainder of the work the proposed end however was defeatedfor I have not seen SHEFFIELDexcept for about eighteen hourssince the fourth of March  Another error necessary to be mentioned is this letting the pages remain on the form after the matter was distributed those two half sheets which are distinguished by the colating letters Q and R will be found to be the same pages viz though different matter These particulars are mentioned merely for the information of the public you may remember I privately apprized you of them as we went on  These are the hardnesses I thought it necessary to rub off to which perhaps it will not be unnecessary to add that as there can be no doubt but that my absence will be immediately taken advantage of and as it is not impossible not only that much spurious trash may be given out for mine but also that my real compositions may surreptitiously get into the world I entreat the public not to credit any declaration either in print or otherwise to this effect not properly authenticated and I also give notice that I shall have left authority behind me to prosecute all those who shall either  perform  or  publish  any composition of mine without my written permission  This last declaration has put it in my power to finish this letter very pleasurably by mentioning Mr PRESTON in the Strand I desire he will accept my public thanks for the innumerable kindnesses I have received at his hands and I sincerely hope that the music of  Liberty Hall Harvest Home  the  songs  in  The Readings  and the variety of other things he has liberally purchased of me may by being productive to him in some degree acquit me of so large a load of obligations To advise all persons who may have dealings in his way to apply  to him is only asking them to consider their own interest 'Tis upon that principle I am happy to find that it has been in my power to contribute some little towards the extension of his immense country correspondence for I have never returned to any place where I have not been thanked for my recommendation In short if a large capital a strong back a well conducted home manufactory the best materials a reasonable price strict fidelity the most minute care and attention and a remarkable dispatch and punctuality are the true requisites of an opulent and respectable man of business Mr PRESTON certainly answers the description to which he addsand my own feelings strongly evince itall the  warmth sincerity  and  generosity  of a  faithful  and  valuable  FRIEND  The heightening touches will come in the next letter and finish this picture after which it may be hung uplike of that of PRAXITILESon  the second day  when I'll venture to say if there be any beauties in truth some of them will be here allowedif it were only a repetition of those truths which have marked me as  Your very thankful friend C DIBDIN  London    April    LETTER CVII  CONCLUSION  "  And now I am come to the end of my song  "  To the Rev Mr  DEAR SIR  I Come now to that moment to which I have so long looked with panting anxiety To GARRICK it was  "an awful one"  for he had every enjoyment  "his  little  heart could wish"  He was courted encouraged flattered and caressed his productions were shewn to all possible advantage his very foibles were objects of imitation  and all this  HE LEFT To me it is a welcome moment for I have had but little enjoymentexcept that chearfulness of heart which has so often galled my oppressors I have been envied discouraged vilified and traduced obliged to sustain every possible humiliationwhile my poor attempts have been ushered into the world under the most mortifying disadvantages  and from all this  I EMANCIPATE  It was with peculiar propriety that I put this resolution in practice by an appeal to the public In the course of such a length of time I must of necessity have noticed many shameful impositions To communicate such information as might go to the  detection  if not the  cure  of these I conceived it my dutyas a mite of gratitude in return for the innumerable instances of kindness I have received at the hands of my liberal benefactors and I flatter myself this  duty is discharged in that proper candid way that actuates the feelings of all who aim at the good will of the benevolent and can smile with contemptuous disregard at the malignant and unworthy  I have purposely reserved this place to thank one more friend whose exertions in procuring subscribers for this work have been as flattering as beneficial to me I have already mentioned this gentleman for it was owing to him I am honoured with that ROYAL NOTICE which so greatly distinguishes theI hope  propitious hour  that if fortune smile must lead me to independance His generosity however did not stop here for through the medium of his application has been procured the name of almost every noble personage in my listbesides a large number of others My only difficulty is how to thank him He will not feel the consciousness of any merit in what he has donefor  his  gratification has been equal to  mine  nevertheless he must not be offended if I assure him with all this philanthropy he cannot be more pleased than I am nor more  disinterestedly  for when he shall have taken still further painswhich I know he meditateshis  kind wishes  and  unparalleled attention  will be a welcomer pleasure than  the advantages arising from them  And nowhaving paid this tribute of gratitudenothing further remains than most seriously and solemnly to assure the public  That in the prosecution of this work I have not had an unfair an unworthy nor an unhandsome wish to gratify that if I have spoken in  strong language  it well became the dictates of TRUTH and so may I prosperas that cheerful fearless manly monitor prompts mewhile I declare that in this moment of parting from every public connection I have not an ungenerous nor unkind wish to any human being in the whole round of existence  Thus my dear friend I commit myself to the world and as to my particular good wishes to you when you shall have summed up the finish of every letter and seen what they all amount to I desire it may be considered that I subscribe to the truth of the sum total by assuring you  now  that I am as ever  Most cordially yours C DIBDIN  London    May    FINIS  DIRECTIONS TO THE BINDER  Place the song of Pomposo to face page  The Cape of GoodHope page  The
