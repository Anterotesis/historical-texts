 CONSIDERATIONS ON RELIGION AND PUBLIC EDUCATION WITH REMARKS ON THE  SPEECH  OF  M DUPONT  DELIVERED IN THE NATIONAL CONVENTION OF FRANCE TOGETHER WITH AN ADDRESS TO THE LADIES c OF  GREAT BRITAIN and IRELAND  BY HANNAH MORE  FIRST  AMERICAN  EDITION  PRINTED AT  BOSTON  BY WELD AND GREENOUGH SOLD at the MAGAZINE OFFICE No State Street MDCCXCIV  A PREFATORY ADDRESS TO THE LADIES c of GREAT BRITAIN and IRELAND IN BEHALF OF THE FRENCH EMIGRANT CLERGY  IF it be allowed that there may arise occasions so extraordinary that all the lesser motives of delicacy ought to vanish before them it is presumed that the present emergency will in some measure justify the hardiness of an Address from a private individual who stimulated by the urgency of the case sacrifices inferior considerations to the ardent desire of raising further supplies towards relieving a distress as pressing as it is unexampled  We are informed by public advertisement that the large sums already so liberally subscribed for the Emigrant Clergy are almost exhausted Authentic information adds that multitudes of distressed Exiles in the island of Jersey are on the point of wanting bread  Very many to whom this address is made have already contributed O let them not be weary in welldoing Many are making generous exertions for  the just and natural claims of the widows and children of our brave seamen and soldiers Let it not be said that the present is an  interfering  claim Those to whom I write have bread enough and to spare You who fare sumptuously every day and yet complain you have little to bestow let not this bounty be subtracted from another bounty but rather from some superfluous expense  The beneficent and right minded want no arguments to be pressed upon them but I write to those of every description Luxurious habits of living which really furnish the distressed with the fairest grounds for application are too often urged as a motive for withholding assistance and produced as a plea for having little to spare Let her who indulges such habits and pleads such excuses in consequence reflect that by retrenching  one  costly dish from her abundant table the superfluities of  one  expensive desert  one  evening's public amusement she may furnish at least a week's subsistence to more than one person  Mc Bowdler's letter states that about Six Shillings a week included the expenses of each Priest at Winchester  as liberally bred perhaps as herself and who in his own country may have often tasted how much more blessed it is to give than to receiveto a minister of God who has been long accustomed to bestow the necessaries he is now reduced to solicit  Even your young daughters whom maternal prudence has not yet furnished with the means of bestowing may be cheaply taught the first rudiments of charity together with an important lesson of economy They may be taught to sacrifice a feather a set of ribbons an expensive ornament an idle diversion And if they are thus instructed that there is no true charity without self denial they will  gain  more than they are called upon to  give  For the suppression of one luxury for a charitable purpose is the exercise of two virtues and this without any pecuniary expense  Let the sick and afflicted remember how dreadful it must be to be exposed to sufferings without one of the alleviations which mitigate  their  affliction How dreadful it is to be without comforts without necessaries without a home  without a country  While the gay and prosperious would do well to recollect how suddenly and terribly those for whom we plead were by the surprising vicissitudes of life thrown from equal heights of gaiety and prosperity And let those who have husbands fathers sons brothers or friends reflect on the uncertainties of war and the revolution of human affairs It is only by imagining the possibility of those who are dear to us being placed in the same calamitous circumstances that we can obtain an adequate feeling of the woes we are called upon to commiserate  In a distress so wide and comprehensive many are prevented from giving by that common excuse "That it is but a drop of water in the ocean" But let them reflect that if all the individual drops were withheld there would be no ocean at all and the inability to give much ought not on any occasion to be converted into an excuse for giving nothing Even moderate circumstances need not plead an exemption The industrious tradesman will not even in a political view be eventually a loser by his small contribution The money raised is neither carried out of our country nor dissipated in luxuries but returns again to the community to our shops and to our markets to procure the bare necessaries of life  Some have objected to the difference of  religion  of those for whom we solicit Such an objection hardly deserves a serious answer Surely if the superstitious Tartar hopes to become possessed of the courage and talents of the enemy he slays the Christian is not afraid of catching or of propagating the error of the sufferer he relievesChristian charity is of no party We plead not for their faith but for their wants And let the more scrupulous who look for desert as well as  distress in the objects of their bounty bear in mind that if these men could have sacrificed their conscience to their convenience they had not now been in this country Let us shew them the purity of  our  religion by the beneficence of our actions  If you will permit me to press upon you such high motives and it were to be wished that in every action we were to be influenced by the highest perhaps no act of bounty to which you may be called out can ever come so immediately under that solemn and affecting description which will be recorded in the great day of account  I was a stranger and ye took me in  THE following is an exact Translation from a  SPEECH  made in the National Convention at Paris on Friday the th of December    in a Debate on the Subject of establishing Public Schools for the Education of Youth by Citizen  DUPONT  a Member of considerable Weight and as the Doctrines contained in it were received with unanimous Applause except from two or three of the Clergy it may be fairly considered as an Exposition of the Creed of that Enlightened Assembly Translated from  Le Moniteur  of Sunday the th of December  WHAT Thrones are overturned Sceptres broken Kings expire And yet the Altars of GOD remain Here there is a murmur from some Members and the Abbé ICHON demands that the person speaking may be called to order Tyrants in outrage to nature continue to burn an impious incense on those Altars Some murmurs arise but they are lost in the applauses from the majority of the Assembly The Thrones that have been reversed have left these Altars naked unsupported and tottering A single breath of enlightened reason will now be sufficient to make them disappear and if humanity is under obligations to the French nation for the first of these benefits the fall of Kings can it be doubted but that the French people now sovereign will be wise enough in like manner to overthrow those Altars and  those Idols  to which those Kings have hitherto made them subject  Nature  and  Reason  these  ought to be the gods of men These are my gods Here the Abbé AUDREIN cried out "There is no bearing this" and rushed out of the Assembly A great laugh Admire  nature  cultivate  reason  And you Legislators if you desire that the French people should be happy make haste to propagate these principles and to teach them in your primary schools instead of those fanatical principles which have hitherto been taught The tyranny of Kings was confined to make their people miserable in this lifebut those other tyrants the Priests extend their dominion into another of which they have no other idea than of eternal punishments a doctrine which some men have hitherto had the good nature to believe But the moment of the catastrophe is comeall these prejudices must fall at the same time  We must destroy them or they will destroy us  For myself I honestly avow to tile Convention  I am an atheist  Here there is some noise and tumult But a great number of members cry out "What is that to usyou are an honest man" But I defy a single individual among the twentyfour millions of Frenchmen to make against me any well grounded reproach I doubt whether the Christians or the Catholics of which the last speaker and those of his opinion have been talking to us can make the same challengeGreat applauses There is another considerationParis has had great losses It has been deprived of the commerce of luxury of that factitious splendour which was found at courts and invited strangers hither Well We must repair these lossesLet me then represent to you the times that are fast approaching when our philosophers whose names are celebrated throughout Europe PETION SYEYES CONDORCET and otherssurrounded in our Pantheon as the Greek philosophers where at Athens with a crowd of disciples coming from all parts of Europe walking like the Peripatetics and teachingthis man the system of the universe and developing the progress of all human knowledge that perfectioning  the social system and shewing in our decree of the th of June the feeds of the insurrections of the th of July and the th of August and of all those insurrections which are spreading with such rapidity throughout EuropeSo that these young strangers on their return to their respective countries may spread the same lights and may operate  for the happiness of Mankind  similar revolutions throughout the world  Numberless applauses arose almost throughout the whole Assembly and in the Galleries  REMARKS ON THE SPEECH of Mr DUPONT ON THE SUBJECTS OF Religion and Public Education  IT is presumed that it may not be thought unseasonable at this critical time to offer to the Public and especially to the more religious part of it a few slight observations occasioned by the late famous Speech of Mr Dupont which exhibits the Confession of Faith of a considerable Member of the French National Convention Though the Speech itself has been pretty generally read yet it was thought necessary to perfix it to these Remarks left such as have not already perused it might from an honest reluctance to credit the existence of such principles dispute its authenticity and accuse the remarks if unaccompanied by the Speech of a spirit of invective and unfair exaggeration At the same time it must be confessed that its impiety is so monstrous that many good men were of opinion it ought not to be made familiar to the minds of Englishmen for there are crimes with which even the imagination should never come in contact  But as an ancient nation intoxicated their slaves and then exposed them before their children in order to increase their horror of intemperance so it is hoped that this piece of impiety may be placed in such a light before the eyes of the Christian reader that in proportion as his detestation is raised his faith instead of being shaken will be only so much the more strengthened  This celebrated Speech though delivered in an assembly of Politicians is not on a question of politics but on one as superior as the soul is to the body and eternity to time The object here is not to dethrone kings but HIM by whom kings reign It does not here excite the cry of indignation that  Louis  reigns but that  the Lord God omnipotent reigneth  Nor is this the declaration of some obscure and anonymons person but an exposition of the Creed of a public Leader It is not a sentiment hinted in a journal hazarded in a pamphlet or thrown out at a disputing club but it is the implied faith of the rulers of a great nation  Little notice would have been due to this famous Speech if it had conveyed the sentiments of only  one  vain orator but it should be observed that it was heard received  applauded  with two or three exceptions onlya fact which you who have scarcely believed in the existence of atheism will hardly credit and which for the honour of the eighteenth century it is hoped that our posterity being still more unacquainted with such corrupt opinions will reject as totally incredible  A love of liberty generous in its principle inclines some good men still to favour the proceedings of the National Convention of France They do not yet perceive that the licentious wildness which has been excited in that country is destructive of all true happiness and no more resemble liberty than the tumultuous joys of the drunkard resemble the cheerfulness of a sober and well regulated mind  To those who do not know of what strange inconsistences man is made up who have not considered how some persons having at first been hastily and heedlessly drawn in as approvers by a sort of natural progression soon become principalsto those who have never observed by what a variety of strange associations in the mind opinions that seem the most irreconcileable meet at some unsuspected turning and come to be united in the same manto all such it may appear quite incredible that well meaning and even pious people should continue to applaud the principles of a set of men who have publicly made known their intention of abolishing Christianity as far as the demolition of altars priests temples and institutions  can  abolish it and as to the religion itself this also they may traduce and for their own part reject but we know from the comfortable promise of an authority still sacred in this country at least that  the gates of hell shall not prevail against it  Let me not be misunderstood by those to whom these slight remarks are principally addressed that class of well intentioned people who favour at least if they do not adopt the prevailing sentiments of the new Republic You are not here accused of being the wilful abetters of insidelity God forbid  we are persuaded better things of you and things which accompany salvation  But this  ignis fatuus  of liberty and universal brotherhood which the French are madly pursuing with the insignia of freedom in one hand and the bloody bayonet in the other has bewitched your senses and is in danger of misleading your steps You are gazing at a meteor raised by the vapours of vanity which these wild and insatuated wanderers are pursuing to their destruction and though for a moment you mistake it for a heavenborn light which leads to the perfection of human freedom you will should you join in the mad pursuit soon discover that it will conduct you over dreary wilds and  sinking bogs only to plunge yon in deep and inevitable ruin  Much very much is to be said in vindication of your favouring in the first instance their political projects The cause they look in hand seemed to be the great cause of human kind Its very name insured its popularity What English heart did not exult at the demolition of the Bastile What lover of his species did not triumph in the warm hope that one of the finest countries in the world would soon be one of the most free Popery and despotism though chained by the gentle influence of Louis XVIth had actually slain their thousands Little was it then imagined that anarchy and atheism the monsters who were about to succeed them would soon stay their ten thousands If we cannot regret the defeat of the two former tyrants what must they be who can triumph in the mischiefs of the two latter Who I say that had a head to reason or a heart to feel did not glow with hope that from the ruin's of tyranny and the rubbish of popery a beautiful and finely framed edifice would in time have been constructed and that ours would not have been the only country in which the patriot's fair idea of well understood liberty and of the most pure and reasonable as well as the most sublime and exalted Christianity might be realized  But alas it frequently happens that he wise and good are not the most adventurous in attacking the mischiefs which they perceive and lament With a timidity in some respects virtuous they fear attempting any thing which may possible aggravate the evils they deplore or put to hazard the blessings they already enjoy They dread plucking up the wheat with the tares and are rather apt with a spirit of hopeless resignation  To bear the ills they have  Than fly to others that they know not of  While sober minded and considerate men therefore sat mourning over this complicated mass of error  and waited till God in his own good time should open the blind eyes the vast scheme of reformation was left to that set of rash and presumptuous adventurers who are generally watching how they may convert public grievances to their own personal account It was undertaken not upon the broad basis of a wise and well digested scheme of which all the parts should contribute to the perfection of one consistent whole It was carried on not by those steady measures founded on rational deliberation which are calculated to accomplish so important an end not with a temperance which indicated a sober love of law or a sacred regard for religion but with the most extravagant lust of power and the most inordinate vanity which perhaps ever instigated human measures a lust of power which threatens to extend its desolating influence over the whole globe a vanity of the same destructive species with that which stimulated the celebrated incendiary of Ephesus who being weary of his native obscurity and insignificance and prefering infamy to oblivion could contrive no other road to fame and immortality than that of letting fire to the exquisite Temple of Diana He was remembered indeed as he desired to be but only to be execrated while the seventh wonder of the world lay prostrate through his crime  It is the same over ruling vanity which operates in their politics and in their religion which makes Kersaint  See his Speech enumerating their intended projects  boast of carrying his destructive projects from the Tagus to the Brazils and from Mexico to the shores of the Ganges which makes him menace to outstrip the enterprises of the most extravagant hero of romance and almost undertake with the marvelous celerity of the nimbly footed Puck  To put a girdle round about the earth  In forty minutes    It is the same vanity still the master passion in the bosom of a Frenchman which leads Dupont and  Manuel to undertake in their orations to abolish the Sabbath exterminate the Priesthood erect a Pantheon for the World restore the Peripatetic Philosophy and in short revive every thing of ancient Greece except the pure taste the wisdom the love of virtue the veneration of the laws and that degree of reverence which even virtuous Pagans professed for the Deity  It is surely to be charged to the inadequate and wretched hands into which the work of reformation fell and not to the impossibility of amending the civil and religious institutions of France that all has succeeded so ill It cannot be denied perhaps that a reforming spirit was wanted in that country their government was not more despotic than their church was superstitious and corrupt  But though this is readily granted and though it may he unfair to blame those who in the  first outset  of the French Revolution rejoiced even on religious motives yet it is astonishing how any pious person even with all the blinding power of prejudice can think without horror of the  present  state of France It is no less wonderful how any rational man could even in the beginning of the Revolution transfer that reasoning however just it might be when applied to France to the case of England For what can be more unreasonable than to draw from different and even opposite premises the same conclusion Must a revolution be equally necessary in the case of two sorts of Government and two sorts of Religion which are the very reverse of each other opposite in their genius unlike in their fundamental principles and widely different in each of their component parts  That despotism priestcraft intolerance and superstition are terrible evils no candid Christian it is presumed will deny but blessed be God though these mischiefs are not yet entirely banished from the face of the earth they have scarcely any existence in this country  To guard against a real danger and to cure a final abuses of which the existence has been first plainly proved by the application of a suitable remedy requires diligence as well as courage observation as well as genius patience and temperance as well as zeal and spirit It requires the union of that clear head and found heart which constitute the true patriot But to conjure up fancied evils or even greatly to aggravate real ones and then to exhaust our labour in combating them is the characteristic of a distempered imagination and an ungoverned spirit  Romantic crusades the ordeal trial drowning of witches the torture and the Inquisition have been justly reprobated as the soulest stain of the respective periods in which to the disgrace of human reason they existed but would any man be rationally employed who should now stand up gravely to declaim against these as the predominating mischiefs of the present century Even the whimsical Knight of La Mancha himself would not fight wind mills that were pulled down yet I will venture to say that the above named evils are at present little more chimerical than some of those now fo bitterly complained of among us It is not as Dryden said when one of his works was unmercifully abused that the piece has not faults enough in it but the critics have not had the wit to fix upon the right ones  It is allowed that as a nation we have faults enough but our political critics err in the objects of their censure They say little of those real and pressing evils resulting from our own corruption which constitute the actual miseries of life while they gloomily speculate upon a thousand imaginary political grievances and fancy that the reformation of our rulers and our legislators is all that is wanting to make us a happy people  The principles of just and equitable government were perhaps never more fully established nor public justice more exactly administered Pure and undefiled  religion was never laid more open to all than at this day I wish I could say we were a religious people but this at least may be safely asserted that the great truths of religion were never better understood that Christianity was never more completely stripped from all its incumbrances and disguises or more thoroughly purged from human infusions and whatever is debasing in human institutions  Let us in this yet happy country learn at least one great and important truth from the errors of this distracted people Their conduct has awfully illustrated a position which is not the less found for having been often controverted That no degree of wit and learning no progress in commerce no advances in the knowledge of nature or in the embellishments of art can ever thoroughly tame that savage the natural human heart without RELIGION The arts of social life may give a sweetness to the manners and language and induce in some degree a love of justice truth and humanity but attainments derived from such inferior causes are no more than the semblance and the shadow of the qualities derived from pure Christianity Varnish is an extraneous ornament but true polish is a proof of the solidity of the body it depends greatly on the nature of the substance is not superinduced by accidental causes but in a good measure proceeding from internal foundness  The poets of that country whose style sentiments manners and religion the French so affectedly labour to imitate have left keen and biting fatires on the Roman vices Against the late proceedings in France no fatirist need employ his pen that of the historian will be quite sufficient Fact will put fable out of countenance and the crimes which are usually held up to our abhorrence in works of invention will be regarded as flat and feeble by those who shall peruse the records of the tenth of August of the second and third of September and of lie twenty first of January  If the same astonishing degeneracy in taste principle and practice should ever come to flourish among us Britons may still live to exult in the desolation of her cities and in the destruction of her finest monuments of art she may triumph in the peopling of the fortresses of her rocks and her forests may exult in being once more restored to that glorious state of  liberty and equality  when all subsisted by rapine and the chace when all O enviable privilege were equally savage equally indigent and equally naked may extol it as the restoration of reason and the triumph of nature that they are again brought to feed on acorns instead of bread Groves of consecrated misletoe may happily succeed to useless corn fields and Thor and Woden may hope once more to be inverted with all their bloody honours  Let not any serious readers feel indignation as if pains were ungenerously taken to involve their religous with their political opinions Far be it from me to wound unnecessarily the feelings of people whom I so sincerely esteem but it is much to be suspected that certain opinions in politics have a tendency to lead to certain opinions in religion Where so much is at stake they will do well to keep their consciences tender in order to which they should try to keep their discernment acute They will do well to observe that the same restless spirit of innovation is busily operating under various though seemingly unconnected forms To observe that the same impatience of restraint the same contempt of order peace and subordination which makes men bad citizens makes them bad Christians and that to this secret but almost infallible connexion between religious and political sentiment does France owe her present unparalleled anarchy and impiety  There are doubtless in that unhappy country multitudes of virtuous and reasonable men who rather silently acquiesce in the authority of their present turbulent government than embrace its principles or  promote its projects from the sober ccnviction of their own judgment These together with those conscientious exiles whom this nation so honourably protects may yet live to rejoice in the restoration of true liberty and solid peace to their native country when light and order shall spring from the present darkness and confusion and the reign of chaos shall be no more  May I be permitted a short digression on the subject of those exiles It shall only be to remark that all the boasted conquests of our Edwards and our Henrys over the French nation do not confer such substantial glory on our own country as the derives from having received protected and supported among multitudes of other sufferers at a time and under circumstances so peculiarly disadvantageous to herself  three thousand priests  of a nation habitually her enemy and of a religion intolerant and hostile to her own This is the solid triumph of true Christianity and it is worth remarking that the deeds which poets and historians celebrate as rare and splendid actions and sublime instances of greatness of soul in the heroes of the Pagan world are but the ordinary and habitual virtues which occur in the common course of action among Christians quietly performed without effort or exertion and with no view to renown but resulting naturally and necessarily from the religion they profess  So predominating is the power of an example we cave once admired and set up as a standard of imitation and so fascinating has been the ascendency of the Convention over the minds of those whose approbation of French politics commenced in the earlier periods of the Revolution that it extends to the most trivial circumstances I cannot forbear to notice this in an instance which though inconsiderable in itself yet ceases to be so when we view it in the light of a symptom of the reigning disease  While the fantastic phraseology of the new Republic is such as to be almost as disgusting to sound taste as their doctrines are to sound morals it is curious to observe how deeply the addresses which have been sent to it from the Clubs  See the Collection of Addresses from England c Published by Mr Mc KENZIE  College Green  DUBLIN  in this country have been infected with it as far at least as phrases and terms are objects of imitation In other respects it is but justice to the French Convention to confess that they are hitherto without rivals and without imitators for who can aspire to emulate that compound of anarchy and atheism which in their debates is mixed up with the pedantry of school boys the jargon of a cabal and the vulgarity and illbreeding of a mob One instance of the prevailing cant may suffice where an hundred might be adduced and it is not the most exceptionableTo demolish every existing law and establishment to destroy the fortunes and ruin the principles of every country into which they are carrying their destructive arms and their frantic doctrines to untie or cut asunder every bond which holds society together to impose their own arbitrary shackles where they succeed and to demolish every thing where they failThis desolating system by a most unaccountable perversion of language they are pleased to call by the endearing name of  fraternization  and fraternization is one of the favourite terms which their admirers have adopted Little would a simple stranger uninitiated in this new and surprising dialect imagine that the peaceful terms of fellowcitizen and of brother the winning offer of freedom and happiness and the warm embrace of fraternity were only watchwords by which they in effect  Cry havoc  And let slip the dogs of war  In numberless other instances the fashionable language of France at this day would be as unintelligible to the correct writers of the age of Louis the XIVth as their fashionable notions of liberty would be irreconcileable  with those of the true Revolution Patriots of his great contemporary and victorious rival William the Third  Such is indeed their puerile rage for novelty in the invention of new words and the perversion of their taste in the use of old ones that the celebrated Vossius whom Christine of Sweden oddly complimented by saying that he was so learned as not only to know whence all words came but whither they were going would  were he admitted to the honours of a sitting  be obliged to confess that he was equally puzzled to tell the one or to foretel the other  If it shall please the Almighty in his anger to let loose this insatuated people as a scourge for the iniquities of the human race if they are delegated by infinite justice to act as storm and tempest fulfilling his word if they are commissioned to perform the errand of the destroying lightning or the avenging thunderbolt let us try at least to extract personal benefit from national calamity let every one of us high and low rich and poor enter upon this serious and humbling inquiry how much his own individual offences have contributed to that awful aggregate of public guilt which has required such a visitation Let us carefully examine in what proportion we have separately added to that common stock of abounding iniquity the description of which formed the character of an ancient nation and is so peculiarly applicable to our own  Pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness  Let every one of us humbly inquire in the selfsuspecting language of the disoiples to their Divine Master  Lord is it I  Let us learn to fear the fleets and armies of the enemy much less than those iniquities at home which this alarming dispensation may be intended to chastize  The war which the French have declared against us is of a kind altogether unexampled in every respect insomuch that human wisdom is baffled when it would pretend to conjecture what may be the event  But this at least we may safely say that it is not so much the force of French bayonets as the contamination of French principles that ought to excite our apprehensions We trust that through the blessing of GOD we shall be defended from their open hostilities by the temperate wisdom of our Rulers and the bravery of our fleets and armies but the domestic danger arising from licentious and irreligious principles among ourselves can only be guarded against by the personal care and vigilance of every one of us who values religion and the good order of society  GOD grant that those who go forth to fight our battles instead of being intimidated by the number of their enemies may bear in mind that "there is no restraint with GOD to save by many or by few" And let the meanest of us who remains at home remember also that even he may contribute to the internal safety of his country by the integrity of his private life and to the success of her defenders by following them with his servent prayers And in what war can the sincere Christian ever have stronger inducements to pray for the success of his country than in this Without entering far into any political principles the discussion of which would be in a great measure foreign to the design of this little tract it may be remarked that the unchristian principle of revenge is not our motive to this war conquest is not our object nor have we had recourse to hostility in order to effect a change in the internal government of France  See the Report of Mr Pitt's Speech in the House of Commons on Feb  The present war is undoubtedly undertaken entirely on defensive principles It is in defence of our King our Constitution our Religion our Laws and consequently our  Liberty  in the found and rational sense of that term It is to defend ourselves forn the savage violence of a crusade made against all Religion as well as all Government If eve  therefore a war was undertaken on the ground  selfdefence and necessityif ever men might be li  rally  said to fight  pro  ARIS  et socis  this seems to be the occasion  The ambition of conquerors has been the source of great and extensive evils Religious fanaticism of still greater But little as I am disposed to become the apologist of either the one principle or the other there is no extravagance in asserting that they have seemed incapable of producing even in ages that extent of mischief that comprehensive desolation which  philosophy falsely so called  has produced in three years  Christians it is not a small thing  it is your life  The pestilence of irreligion which you detest will insinuate itself imperceptibly with those manners phrases and principles which you admire and adopt It is the humble wisdom of a Christian to shrink from the most distant approaches to sin to abstain from the very appearance of evil If we would fly from the deadly contagion of Atheism let us fly from those seemingly remote but not very indirect paths which lead to it Let France choose this day whom she will serve  but as for us and our houses we will serve the Lord  And O gracious and long suffering God before that awful period arrives which shall exhibit the dreadful effects of such an education as the French nation are instituting before a race of men can be trained up not only without the knowledge of THEE but in the contempt of THY most holy law do THOU in great mercy change the heart of this people as the heart of one man Give them not finally over to their own corrupt imaginations to their own heart's lusts But after having made them a fearful example to all the nations of the earth what a people  can  do who have cast off the fear of THEE do THOU graciously being them back to a sense of that law which they have violated and to participation of that mercy which they have abused fo that they may happily find while the discovery can be attended with consolation that  doubtless there is a reward for the righteous verily there is a  God  who judgeth the earth  THE END
