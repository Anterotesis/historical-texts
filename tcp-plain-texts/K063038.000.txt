FOR J WILKIE NO ST PAUL'SCHURCHYARD FIELDING AND WALKER PATERNOSTERROW G KEARSLEY FLEETSTREET P ELSMLEY STRAND W DAVIS PICCADILLY MDCCLXXIX  PREFACE  Tthose who judge of dramatic merit from the Greek models the rules of French critics or the examples of modern writers a justification of the following piece would be attempted in vain They would call it a motley performance deficient in almost every article which constitutes a true and proper tragedy If the author was to alledge that he never meant to compose a tragedy according to their acceptation of the word but that his intention was to fill up a picture of real life in a certain given time the outlines of which were taken from historical facts his reason would be deemed unsatisfactory  Regardless of the end proposed they would continue to exclaim that the unities were neglected that the grave was intermingled with the ludicrous that the business of the drama frequently stood still that the dialogue was too familiar and the metre little better than measured prose  How far some of these objections may be valid and how many more might perhaps with  reason be urged against particular passages the author would not determine The force of others of them he would endeavour to diminish by answering that they militate equally against human life itself and that while he should be sorry to have this denominated an artificial poem he would flatter himself it cannot be justly thought an unnatural one  Dr Johnson indeed in the preface to his edition of Shakespeare seems to have sufficiently vindicated this particular species of writing to which those who please may instead of tragedy give the more simple name of history Neither are there wanting many good judges of composition who wish that the less studied diction and more plain and level metre of the school of that immortal poet which seems to have ended with Southern had been continued to the present time Even this performance with all its imputed irregularities and deficiencies will perhaps be preferred by them to those translated tragedies or imitations which of late years have through novelty lived their nine nights on the stage and been damned for ever after in the closet tho' they had been corrected and metamorphosed by managers calculated to afford to favourite actors or actresses opportunities of shining and curtailed by lord chamberlains  A diversification of characters hath been attempted in this piece and to give to every character the mode of sentiment and expression peculiarly suited to it It is not at all difficult for a man of a very middling genius to contrive a regular plot to pen down a certain number of sounding lines and though his Dramatis Personae are distinguished by particular names to put his own sentiments in their mouths throughout five acts Had the author been solicitous of adapting his plan to the stage or wished to conciliate the favour of the indiscriminating multitude he might probably have followed the same method  However it may appear to us when we are reading no small attention is requisite in written dialogue of any kind for an author entirely to cast off self This was the characteristic of Shakespeare and perhaps after all the author of this play hath deceived himself and it may with reason be applied to him  Sudet multum frustra{que} laboret  Ausus idem  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  TARQUIN

JUNIUS BRUTUS  ACT  SCENE  Rome  VALERIUS LUCRETIUS  VALERIUS  YES we may weep the ruin of our country  And so must all good men but there's no remedy  The evil is too rank t' admit a cure  Oppression wide hath spread her bane and tainted  The universal air scarce are our souls  Our own much less our words The secret curse  Is frequent offer'd up to all the gods  The midnight silent deprecation calls  For vengeance on the proud the imperious Tarquin  But in the day each wears the face of loyalty  Nor dares so jealous are these groveling times  E'en in his brother's bosom pour the secret  Which ulcerating preys upon his heart  How we two thus have dared communicate  Our thoughts either to other is to me  Most strange and passing marvel  LUCRETIUS  Had I not known thee long thou noblest Roman  Amid these worst of times immoveable  In honour's steady course invariably  Upright and just in thy domestic life  Untainted too I would not thus have open'd  My inmost breast or given the passing wind  An opportunity to bear my words  On its licentious wing to th' tyrant's ear  VALERIUS  A mutual confidence henceforth be ours  Scarcely can I express with what abhorrence  I look upon this monster of a man  Scan the whole catalogue of horrid crimes  And if you find one he hath not committed  I will retract my words and call him virtuous  His brother first he poison'd to possess  His wife to gain the crown assassinated  Most ruffian like the good old king by marriage  His father I beheld the elder thrown  Down from the senatehouse his aged limbs  Bruised by the flinty pavement his white locks  Which from the lawless robber would have gain'd  Respect and veneration wildly scatter'd  Over his sace defiled with clotted gore  Raised from the ground with utmost difficulty  And tottering t'ward his home he met his death  Still did insatiate cruelty pursue  His breathless corse denied the common rites  Of burial all men struck with horror shunn'd  Th' accursed spot yet then his savage wife  Drunk with hot draughts of empire or possess'd  By the infernal furies every tie  Of human nature cast aside drove on  High in her stately chariot and impell'd  Th' affrighted horses o'er him where he lay  O'er the dead body of her murder'd father  LUCRETIUS  Had I been told the fact as perpetrated  In any foreign country my belief  Would have rebell'd I wonder that the sun  Turn'd not his course as at th' inhuman feast  Of Grecian Atreus ever to reflection  As the deed rises in its native hue  My blood runs cold No wonder if his throne  Founded by means like these should be supported  By the same means Hence in what copious streams  Hath flow'd the blood of princely senators  Their crimes were worth or riches hath he spared  One but whom absolute necessity  Compell'd or mean opinion of his faculties  Suffer'd to live  VALERIUS  To this his cruel policy  He adds superior talents with a soul  That penetrates mankind he bears conjoin'd  The fiery spirit of the warrior God  Talents by virtue guided which might place him  Among the first of kings but now serve only  To make him bold and resolute in vice  And what is worse create an awe a dread  On which as on a base not to be shaken  Stands fix'd hightowering tyranny  LUCRETIUS  Yet we  Need not complain us he hath spared and me  While 'gainst the Ardeates he wages war  In trust exalted to be governor  Of this fair city  VALERIUS  Indeed were life alone to be esteem'd  We should not murmur but to breathe the air  To walk about at large eat when we please  Sleep at our will this is not lifethe beast  Upon the mountain leads a life like this  When I'm so selfish as to center all  My sense of pleasure here when I cast off  Tender humanity which feels as relative  To all the members of society  Joy or affliction may I then be cursed  With such a life as this  LUCRETIUS  Didst thou remember  Among the senators by Tarquin slain  The name of Marcius Junius  VALERIUS  Well I knew him  But what of him  LUCRETIUS  Oh He was placed above  The strain of men his many virtues made him  Respected as a god by th' sons of Rome  His ancestors came hither with Aeneas  From flaming Troy the valour of his race  Th' heroic ardor which inflames the breast  Of conscious greatness and uplifts mankind  To something of divinity dwelt in him  He was a man that had he 'scaped the wreck  Of those tempestuous days would ne'er have suffer'd  Gigantic tyranny to take such strides  At least some check he would have been some curb  Upon the mouth of headstrong appetite  And wild ambition This our Tarquin knew  And at the same time looking with an eye  Of greediness upon his large possessions sent  And slew him and his elder son a youth  Of gracious hopes the younger being absent  Escaped the ruin  VALERIUS  And now dwells with Tarquin  Lucius the fool the laughingstock o' th' court  Whom the young princes always carry with them  To aid their sport and jocund merriment  The but at which they shoot their shafts of wit  Whose paucity of sense and mode uncouth  Aukward and blundering hath deservedly  Got him the name of BrutusBut why waste  Our talk on this same ideot  LUCRETIUS  'Solve the question  I did but hint him speaking of his father  VALERIUS  Indeed why talk at all when all must end  As bootless as beganThere is a bound  Which checks they say all evils in their course  And good ensuesOur evils know no change  Nor have they this extremest limit proved  Tho' that they should be in progression still  Is past beliefYet there's no chance in nature  No possibility of alteration  No man alive to aim at alteration  And his three sons Titus and Aruns Sextus  All equal to their father in ability  Beyond if possible in the black deeds  Of villainy of lust and treachery  Are three firm pillars added to the pile  Which threats to stand for ages Oh these thoughts  Are capable to banish moderation  From the prepared breast and make the wise  Turn fools and madmen  LUCRETIUS  Let us drop the subject  Who knows the secrets of avenging Jove  Perhaps though we shortsighted as we are  Think liberty bound in eternal thraldom  His counsels otherwise decree e'en now  Haply the dread events are bursting forth  Like light'ning from the gloomy firmament  To sweep this race of hellhounds from the earth  VALERIUS  What may be I'll not say but hope long since  Hath ceased with me to wear her sanguine hue  Why should free agents e'en on Jove depend  To sway the will he gaveMan rules himself  His own fate's arbiterTho' o'er these times  Broods desperation shall we not beneath  Her wings immew'd this galling tempting theme  Again reviveWords cannot pluck the thorn  But soothe the smartFarewelI'll to my house  Whither if in the evening you will come  Still on a genuine Roman citizen  My Lares smile  LUCRETIUS  I would attend unbidden  But thy inviting voice should charm me thither  Spite of disease or pain At evening close  I come then farewel    Exeunt  SCENE II  The Camp before Ardea  TITUS ARUNS  TITUS  Why Aruns in what corner sits the wind  What not a word to say quite down i' th' mouth  ARUNS  I am and stranger cannot guess the cause  Unless 'tis living in inaction thus  I would I was in Rome or Rome was here  Or that these coop'dup Ardeats would but sight  I wonder that our father sits contented  Lounging in's camp Plague on their petty sallies  Why doth he not attack the nest at once  With fire and sword and rouse up all the swarm  It was not thus he triumph'd o'er the Sabines  Or wrested from the warlike Volsci's hands  Suessa Pometia with whose glorious spoils  Turning religious all at once he built  The temple in the capitol to Jupiter  Though had he ask'd of me I could have told him  A better way of laying out his money  TITUS  I do believe thee Aruns well I know  To what divinity thou would'st have rear'd  Thy golden altars  ARUNS  Aye and wisely too  Pleasure's my deity my Jupiter  My Juno and Minerva Titus too  If I mistake not is no Atheist there  But worships with as warm enthusiasm  As any votary of them all 'tis true  He wears a graver brow and commits sin  With a more serious philosophic face  There's all the difference between me and thee  A touch of feature only in our hearts  We are most cordially alike  TITUS  Alike  Why now indeed thy airy spirits dance  Sparkling in either eye but when I met thee  What wert thou then Inwrapp'd in discontent  What wilt thou be anon Chiding at straws  For lying in thy path then quick by th'sparks  Of angry passion kindled into flame  Still varying like the windThy heart like mine  When didst thou find my skittish temper start  And fly like thine from one to to'ther side  ARUNS  Well be it so heaven speed us both But Sextus  I envy that same Sextus for his genius  Soars o'er us both and robs us of our birthright  Not that I think we halt behind him much  In our design'd intentions but success  Befriends him farther one would swear he kept  Fortune in pay and that the blindeyed goddess  Accepted bribes from him There's not a woman  He looks on with desire but he possesses  He says but to an enemy Fall down  And down he falls Hah say'st thou is he not  A son of Tarquin and a glorious villain  TITUS  Glorious I grant but not a villain Aruns  Pshaw that's a name may suit a vulgar mouth  A tradesman talking of his brother knave  But rank and station sanctify men's deeds  A king successful cannot be a tyrant  Nor a king's son deserve a title less  Than that of prince  ARUNS  Thou reason'st well by Mars  When I want oracles to be delivered  I need not go to DelphosOut Alas  My blood's again obstructed and I feel  A pain here in my head or in my heart  A sort of creeping kind of lethargy  Are you e'er seiz'd thus Hah here comes my antidote  TITUS  Brutus true he's a doctor for the spleen  You mention'd Delphos when we two went thither  Through the unknown seas of Greece sent by our father  T'enquire the meaning of the prodigy  The snake portentous which with dreadful crest  Appearing in his palace hiss'd aloud  A direful omen Brutus then went with us  Oh I remember well the precious scenes  Of folly which he acted When we gave  Rich presents to the God He offer'd him  A walking stick as if the god would walk  And take the air but that the god was lame  Coming from out the temple gazing back  As loath to leave a place so fine he fell  Over the threshold and plough'd up the ground  Fixing his face i' th' earth  ARUNS  You may remember  The oracle too said that he should bear  Chief sway in Rome who first should kiss his mother  When we came home both at one time we kiss'd her  In that I think we are at least before  Our brother Sextus jointly we reign  After our father  Enter  Brutus  TITUS  Brutus where so fast  Why thou art running like a loaded horse  ARUNS  Or like a slave with fetters on his legs  What have the Rutili attack'd the camp  That thou art posting in this plaguy hurry  BRUTUS  Pray my Lords stop me not I'm sent to you  On special ord'nance from the king farewel  I must return again  ARUNS  But wert thou sent  Only to see us Tell the king our father  We're in good health we thank him for the message  Which thou hast well remember'd to deliver  BRUTUS  Oh my good Lord I had forgot indeed  But in the multitude of public cares  And daily businessif my memory fails  A little'tis no wonderand you know  Memory is such a thing as  TITUS  As a cartwheel  BRUTUS  Indeed my Lord you've hit it mine turns round  And roundsometimes I think my head is turn'd  ARUNS  I too have thought it oft  BRUTUS  Have you my Lord  I'm always glad when you and I agree  You have just such a wit as I should choose  Would I could purchase such an one and put it  Into my brain Yet so I fear 'twould split  My head as air shut up does water bubbles  TITUS  Thou hast spoke wittier Brute than thou'rt aware  ARUNS  But what wilt give me now for a recipe  To make a wit I had it from the Sibyl  Her thou saw'st t'other day who sold to th' king  Her books at such a rate  BRUTUS  Pray let me see it  What will I giveTen acres of my land  ARUNS  Thy land where lies it  BRUTUS  Ask the king my cousin  He knows full well I thank him he's my steward  And takes the trouble off my hands  TITUS  Who told thee so  BRUTUS  The king himselfNow twenty years are past  And more when he sent for me from the farm  Where I had liv'd some time studying philosophy  And such like serious matters  TITUS  Noble sophist  I bend with the profoundest admiration  Of thy rare hidden knowledge  BRUTUS  Yes yes all men  Must grant that I have no small smattering  But where was I OhKinsman says the king  Says he and smiled most graciously upon me  For deeds of blackest and most treasonous nature  Thy father and thy brother were accused of  They've paid the forfeit with their lives for thee  Who knew'st not of their crimes as I love mercy  Nor take delight in wanton deeds of cruelty  Live and be happy the ingenuous heart  And simple manners speaking in thy face  ARUNS  Aye 'tis a simple mannersspeaking face  BRUTUS  Nay is it right to interrupt me thus  ARUNS  Pardon most noble Brutus  BRUTUS  These thy qualities  Promise says he thou ne'er wilt form a plot  Of damn'd conspiracy against thy sovereign  TITUS  Indeed for that I'll be thy bondsman Brutus  BRUTUS  Live in my house companion of my children  As for thy land to ease thee of all care  I'll take it for thy use all that I ask  Of thee is gratitude  TITUS  And art thou not  Grateful for goodness so unmerited  BRUTUS  Am I not Never by the holy Gods  Will I forget it 'tis my constant prayer  To heaven that I may one day have the power  To pay the debt I owe himBut the charm  For wit you told me of  ARUNS  Ohtake it gratis  First then attend with cautionBut the message  You brought from Tarquin  BRUTUS  Father Romulus  That I should loiter thus Why would you keep me  Engaged in talk The king your father calls  A council to consider of the siege  Of Ardea and the future operations  Against the stubborn Rutili your presence  Is ask'd immediately shall I before  And say you're coming  ARUNS  If thou wilt good Brutus  Or else behind or otherwise in th' middle  Come we'll all go together or stay there  And follow at thy leisure    Exeunt  Aruns  and  Titus  BRUTUS  alone  Yet 'tis not this which ruffles methe gibes  And scornful mockeries of illgovern'd youth  Or flouts of painted sycophants and jesters  Reptiles who lay their bellies on the dust  Before the frown of majesty All this  I but expect nor grudge to bear the face  I carry too demands itBut what then  Is my mind fashion'd to the livery  Of dull stupidity which I have worn  These many a day Is't bent aside and warp'd  From its true native dignity Else why  How is't that vengeance now hath slept so long  O prudence ill delayer of great deeds  And noble enterprizesYetnot so  Chance may and accidental circumstance  Crown bold and lucky rashness with success  But oftener not There is perhaps a time  A certain point which waited for with patience  Seiz'd on and urg'd with vigour will go near  To banish chance and introduce assurance  And fixedness in human actions  T' avenge my father's and my brother's murder  And sweet I must confess would be the draught  Had this been all oft hath the murderer's life  Been in my hands a thousand opportunities  I've had to strike the blowand my own life  I had not valued as a rushBut still  There's something farther to be donemy soul  Enjoy the strong conception Oh 'tis glorious  To free a groaning country from oppression  To vindicate man's common's rites and crush  The neck of arroganceTo see Revenge  Spring like a lion from his den and tear  These hunters of mankindGive but the time  Give but the moment gods If I am wanting  May I drag out this ideotfeigned life  To late old age and may posterity  Ne'er know me by another name but that  Of Brutus and the Tarquin's household fool    Exit  SCENE III  HORATIUS HERMINIUS  HORATIUS  Whither away Herminius to the council  HERMINIUS  I go to the assembly call'd by th' king  I know not if you justly can term that  A council where there is no consultation  HORATIUS  We need not now be nice i' th' definition  Of words Horatius which become a soldier  But ill at any time at no time more  Perhaps than now If we are not consulted  We shall be told what Tarquin and his sons  Have predetermined no small share of confidence  As in the city they're the only source  Of government and law so in the camp  They form each enterprize direct each motion  And by the gods were government and law  Temper'd with equity or war with justice  I would not wish for abler lawgivers  Or leaders  HERMINIUS  HoldNo more Horatius  What know you not that tents have often ears  Hearing distinctly If the times are bad  Heav'n in its mercy mend them Pray however  But softly lest the statues of the gods  Should turn informers too Who passes there  Across our path beyond that farther tent  HORATIUS  Is it not Collatine who lately married  Lucretius's daughter  HERMINIUS  Trust me she's reported  The fairest and the worthiest of her sex  HORATIUS  Fairer than ever was a form created  By youthful fancy when the blood strays wild  And neverresting thought is all on fire  The worthiest of the worthy not the nymph  Who met old Numa in his hallow'd walks  And whisper'd in his ear her strains divine  Can I conceive beyond her the young choir  Of vestal virgins bend to her 'Tis wonderful  Amid the darnel hemlock and base weeds  Which now spring rise from the luxurious compost  Spread o'er the realm how this sweet lily rose  How from the shade of these illneighbouring plants  Her father shelter'd her that not a leaf  Is blighted but array'd in purest grace  She blooms unsullied verdure Such her beauties  As might call back the torpid breast of age  To longforgotten rapture such her mind  As might abash the boldest libertine  And turn desire to reverential love  And holiest affection  HERMINIUS  From a praise  So warm a stranger might form some conclusions  HORATIUS  I speak as an acquaintance as a friend  But yet impartially not sway'd by passion  But as I really think had life's gay prime  Presented such an object to my view  You would have thought me mad in my applause  I should have flown above the shining spheres  Of th' azure vault for new comparisons  Yet then not thought them hyperbolical  I loved my wife I praised her but the height  I raised her to reached not to this Lucretia  Though since I've thought it much surpass'd the truth  Here transport would have urged me far beyond  All sober bounds and yet close by my side  Reason would have stood smiling to see herself  So justly superseded  HERMINIUS  Such a prodigy  Should have a husband of no vulgar mould  But Collatine I see him ev'ry where  The princes intimate at their carousals  The first in noise and mirth and jollity  Of the unruly crew  HORATIUS  You are deceiv'd  He's young perhaps unsteady flexible  And yielding to example though indeed  As a relation and being near to th' king  I don't see how if 'twas his inclination  He could do otherwise but he possesses  Many good qualities is gentle kind  And generous wants not courage and I know  Doats with the most impassion'd tenderness  Upon Lucretia Haply 'tis in hopes  To ease his mind from the sharp grief of absence  That thus he mingles with the festive train  And joins the roar of idle rioting  And dissipation though I ne'er observ'd  He join'd it heartily I've seen him oft  Lost in reflection there and oft alone  Musing in melancholy as just now  Thou saw'st him when he pass'd us meditating  With his eyes cast on th' ground But let us haste  To the king's tent  HERMINIUS  BeforeI'll follow you    Exeunt  SCENE IV  Collatia  LUCRETIA LAVINIA  LUCRETIA  How long is it Lavinia since my lord  Hath chang'd his peaceful mansion for the camp  And restless scenes of war  LAVINIA  Why in my simple estimation Madam  'Tis some ten days or thereabout for time  Runs as it shou'd with me in yours it may be  Perhaps ten years  LUCRETIA  And what should make thee think so  LAVINIA  Nay I know not but I have heard folks say  I think my grandamyes my grandam 'twas  That she when she was young in days of yore  And parted from her newlymarried husband  Found the whole method of time's progress chang'd  Instead of wings t' his back posting in haste  And flitting by so quick you could not seize him  By his lank lock a gouty hobbling wretch  That noting of the pain he took in walking  Gave sympathetic pangsShe was a shrewd one  And had if I'd believe her in her spring  Felt all the power of love Oh she could talk  E'en then of purling streams and cooing doves  And of the arms clasp'd thus and brow bent thus  Of aking hearts and such a deal of stuff  That had I not e'en from my tender years  Been guarded well by the superior powers  I should have sought me out a swain and married  And now perhaps been moaning for the absence  Of my true trutle  LUCRETIA  So thy heart ne'er knew  What 'twas to love  LAVINIA  No I thank holy Vesta  Never I've cast indeed sometimes the eyes  Of approbation on a proper man  But never sent deep glances off they darted  From him upon another O my heart  What 'twas to love Why men are all alike  All mothers' sons  LUCRETIA  Thou hast a gadding tongue  But still thy mind is right thou hast no meaning  Affix'd to what thou utter'st  LAVINIA  None to speak of  All that I mean is that if I were married  And that my husband were call'd forth to th' wars  I should not stray through the grove next my house  Invoke the pensive solitude and wooe  The dull and silent melancholy brood  O'er my own thoughts alone or keep myself  Within my house mew'd up a prisoner  I should do like the rest of my sex repair  To company and noise 'tis for philosophers  To love retirement women were not made  To stand up like to statues in a niche  Or feed on their own secret contemplations  LUCRETIA  Go to thou know'st not what thou say'st Lavinia  'Tis for the light of heart to range abroad  To brave the general and licentious eye  To mingle with the fickle trifling crew  Of merriment who laugh aloud if Folly  Shake but the cap upon her head or lift  Her finger up before their face The praise  Of woman is to play the housewife well  Ambitious in her husband's sight t' appear  Grateful and amiable not indeed careless  Of others but preferring him to all  And his society not cloying neither  But manifested in a way known only  To nice affection and distinguished by it  'Tis hers with care to oversee his family  And govern with sure reins of government  No easy task  LAVINIA  Jove bless us what is this  If a superior place in life give not  The power of tasting greater liberty  Of dancing to the honey'd notes of gladness  And walking hand in hand with dainty pleasure  If that the dame of rank must act the housecat  Sit at the hole and watch and cry bopeep  Or sing herself asleep the peasant's wife  Or dull mechanick's is as happy nay  And happier as by necessity  Tied ever down she knows she must comply  And feels she can't attain what most she wishes  LUCRETIA  And why should I believe she wishes more  Than she possesses Why not think there is  A jewel call'd content Why circumscribe  The habitation of true happiness  Within the narrow gawdy idle circle  Of swelling wealth and airblown empty pomp  Why think she cannot dwell with humble duty  Beneath the hut of uncemented stones  Covered with flags well pleas'd to tend her children  Healthy and smiling babes and when her husband  Comes from the field and pacing by his side  Her elder sturdy boy spring t'ward the door  And give them that sincerity of welcome  Which greatness never saw with busy care  And sedulous prepare their evening viands  List to the scant adventures of the day  What passing stranger rowsed their faithful dog  What tree secured them from the scatter'd shower  What distant undistinguish'd noise they heard  And having drawn in their brief chronicle  And thereto added her own little journal  With mutual interchanged looks of love  Retire to rest unbroken No Lavinia  The true delight I'm well convinced dwells there  With nature and her offspring and if those  To whom 'tis giv'n beneath the cedar roof  High overarch'd to sit would relish life  They must as far as possible pursue  Her paths unhackney'd and must imitate  Her unaffected simpleness  LAVINIA  Ah me  I much suspect there are two natures then  For ever since I was a tiny thing  Not higher than this I warrant I have thought  Of nothing all the livelong day but shew  And glitter and rich toys and ornaments  And I have gone to bed and in my sleep  Have dream'd I had them then with the greatest pleasure  Have waked and wept full bitterly to find  That I was disappointed I must own  I have no notion of that other nature  Give me things quite the ontrary give me  To enjoy life like I know who some ladies  And those of the best quality in Rome  Possess a pretty comfortable share  Of that same nature I esteem the best  LUCRETIA  Let others act as they think fit nor let it  Be call'd in them a fault to please themselves  In me a virtueBut I thank the gods  Who made me what I am who gave to me  A father whose indulgent tenderness  More than supplied a mother's loss who died  E'er memory set her stamp on my heart's tablet  Who taught me wealth was dross and that the mind  Possess'd of conscious virtue is more rich  Than all the sunless hoards which Plutus boasts  Oft would he say O my beloved daughter  I've tried nor yet in vain to set thee right  To ope' thine eyes against the Siren charms  Of vanity deluding womankind  Act to approve thyself to thine own heart  Despise the ideot custom which breaks down  The fence which ever should remain strong built  Between the sexes woman's chiefest glory  Is in retirement and her highest pleasure  Results from homeborn and domestic joys  Hear me Lucretia so shalt thou obtain  The crown of woman a deserving husband  Who not a prisoner to the eye alone  A fair complexion or melodious voice  Shall read thee deeper nor shall time which palls  The rage of passion shake his firmer love  Increasing by possessionThis again I thank  The gracious gods this husband too is mine  LAVINIA  I should be glad to see this husband now  These eyes are not the sharpest in the world  Is not that he gay as the morning lark  And laughing with the sons of Tarquin there  His heart is bent on mirth he thinks not he  Like other absent men of his Lucretia  He did not hear a syllable o' th' praise  Her tongue just now bestow'd  LUCRETIA  No more no more  Lest I be angry with thee for a fault  Thou can'st not help thy tongue runs idly  Yet say e'en what thou wilt I'm not offended  LAVINIA  Then I will say I don't believe that lady  Hath truer lord more fix'd in loyalty  And how can he be otherwise Were I  In his condition fickle as I am  And wavering in affection a true woman  Unschool'd untaught by father or by mother  I should cast anchor and forbid my bark  Ever to leave the portWhat shall I say  Unless I say that now I speak the truth  E'en from my heart  LUCRETIA  I know full well thy honesty  Come let us in and we will talk together  Of the stern dangers which attend on war  And rouse the passion fear I know not how  But there is something grateful to the soul  Even in terror though we dread th' event  'Tis pleasing while 'tis but imagined  That my fears ever may be realiz'd  In thee O Collatine ye gods forbid    Exeunt  ACT II  SCENE I  The King's tent  TARQUIN TITUS ARUNS SEXTUS  TARQUIN  MY glory and my pride my three bold sons  Whom I rejoice in more than in th' increase  Of empire and dominion Where's the king  Can say with me his children are his senators  His judges and his generals while you  The first supply I find they were as I  Esteem'd them justly mere superfluous branches  To the commonweal which I with prudent hand  Have lopp'd For government can't be too simple  Torn by variety of ranks and orders  Action is lost in fruitless canvassing  Empty harrangues and vain deliberation  While vigorous enterprize amid the jar  Of bickering parties dares not shew his face  No secrecy observed the enemy  Knows well the bent of every expedition  As soon as plann'd and as th' event's foreseen  Prepares against it warily and strongly  Is this to be a king Oh only name  Of royalty in fact a vassal slave  Tied down and manacled condemn'd to act  Not from himself but as by others tutor'd  While some bold party swallowing up the rest  Seizes the reins of empire and bestows  All the offices of trust He flimsy shadow  Titular monarch cannot help himself  But like a wretched fisher in a boat  From which the sails are rent by the rude winds  The rudder clove asunder and oars lost  Still rides indeed upon the billows backs  Born by the flux and reflux of the tides  At random till despair and famine end  His miserable life or the crazed hulk  Admit the briny wave then both together  Sink in the deep and ne'er are heard of more  Who'd be a king like this  SEXTUS  Who would my father  Rather would I betake me to the plough  And till with utmost toil a land ungrateful  A barren desart where but here and there  A blade of corn would rise and my whole harvest  Scarce serve to keep body and soul together  Till the next year's return Such servitude  Were not to be sustain'd 'twere worse than death  TARQUIN  Still keep these sentiments my son they shew  The man not the poorspirited mean creature  That generally is call'd so but the man  Born to command to lord it o'er these earthworms  To sit in the exalted seat of empire  And wield the sceptre to be plac'd a god  Above the rest as the gods are 'bove him  Had I been guided by the moderate maxims  Of doating politicians had I not  Acted on principles which my soul started  And hands dared execute I should have lived  Coop'd up within the walls of Rome and call'd  Only that petty city those few acres  My sum of territory have pursued  The canting superstitions of old Numa  Or thought with Ancus that to build a bridge  Or thought with Ancus that to build a bridge  Over the Tiber was a wonderous work  Or like old purblind Servius have recorded  Offices ages deaths births marriages  And kept the public register o'th' state  But I resolved to rise above controulment  To seize the glorious substance of true majesty  To be a king indeed and men are not  The restive beings some have but supposed  They on timidity encroach but dare not  Look settled resolution in the face  Habit makes even slavery easy Hence  I turn'd my conquering arms 'gainst all the states  Around and made Hetruria pale with fear  Now may the proudest nation yield to Rome  And own her its superior hence I'm honour'd  Dreaded abroad and courted hence at home  Absolute lord and hence shall leave my children  A stable throne which shall continue firm  To latest ages if not wantonly  Or foolishly they deviate from my steps  TITUS  May Titus perish if he deviate wantonly  ARUNS  And Aruns if he deviate foolishly  SEXTUS  And Sextus if he deviate either way  TARQUIN  I know you better each than to suspect you  Nor think that my example or my precepts  Have been so little view'd or weigh'd so lightly  Keep but you three together in the band  Of mutual fix'dness and you may defy  Time and th' adversity of accident  Or force of maliceBut my sons the reason  Of this our meeting this strong city Ardea  Like to a mighty mound dams up the current  Of our progression were but this our own  The whole Rutilian state of course would follow  The question is how to attain this end  Assault we've tried and wept our hardy veterans  Slain in th' unequal task their walls are high  And in few places only they're assailable  Th' inhabitants are numerous and resolv'd  To sell their freedom dear plenty as yet  Makes them highmettled and they laugh to scorn  Us and our strength Speak each what you advise  Whether again t' advance our scalingladders  And strive with fire and sword to gain admission  Or whether change our siege into blockade  And starve them to surrender Titus speak  TITUS  I see no reason here for much debate  Or many words to fix determination  Our soldiers with their late successless toil  Dispirited and faint theirs with the contrary  Valiant and bold again th' uncertainty  Of being more successful than before  The probability that we shall not  Th' ill consequences if we make th' assault  In vain all tempt me to dissuade from action  To gird the city well harrass the country  Debar them from supplies sap their high walls  Wait till we gain a lucky time for onset  Or deeplaid stratagem this gives a conquest  Certain tho' slow and this do I advise  ARUNS  Think not I speak through contradiction Titus  But I can bring as many arguments  As cogent too and couch them full as briefly  Why we should not delay in every sally  Made since that trial they've been beat to th' gates  This hath restored the courage of our soldiers  And shame now adds a double sting to bravery  Delay breeds relaxation in our duty  The Rutili and their allies may join  Hem us between them and the walls of Ardea  Or march to Rome itself Delay breeds danger  I do not like delay it is a word  I hate 'tis ominous as the raven's croak  It bears with it a cold and deathlike sound  Might I but lead the army once again  To the attack I'd be myself the first  To mount the wall and answer for th' event  If not let the events speak for themselves  Or speak you for them who determine otherwise  SEXTUS  Could I by sly imposture hope to win  This Ardea as I did the town of Gabii  I would again submit my back to th' scourge  And from my father's cruelty a suppliant  Intreat the gull'd inhabitants nor wait  His hint by cutting down the tallest poppies  I'th' presence of the messenger I sent him  To slay their leaders If this could be done  Or any thing like this I'd not advise  Speedy assault or to protract the siege  In both of which I can espy no small  Degree of danger Titus well advises  And so doth Aruns A small grain would turn  The scale in either's favour If our father  Determine for th' assault about it speedily  I'll climb to the top o'th' wall as soon as Aruns  If Titus shall be thought t' have better counsell'd  I'll watch the turn of every circumstance  And hard it shall be if some dexterous craft  Suit not with th' opportunity which must  I'th' course of things present itself  TARQUIN  I wish  That circumstance may offer if it doth  I doubt not of thy ready apprehension  Aruns must be o'erruled he knows my temper  As little brooks delay as his but ardour  Must yield to the necessity o'th' times  ARUNS  Aruns is pleased if every one is pleased  He yields contentedly is quite resign'd  Enter  Brutus  TARQUIN  Say what would'st thou  BRUTUS  Horatius and Herminius  And others the centurions of the army  Came with me to the door o'th' tent they ask  If 'tis your pleasure they should be admitted  TARQUIN  Horatius and Herminius may come in  Let the rest to their tents these two shall bear  Our orders  Enter  Horatius  and  Herminius  Say Horatius and Herminius  Whether you either of you know a reason  Of any force why we should not block up  This town of Ardea and by protracting  The time render ourselves more sure of conquest  With freedom speak  HERMINIUS  I have but only one  Kept from their homes so long the populace  Already thither cast a longing eye  They had been taught t'expect an easy prey  With speed to be obtain'd I fear their murmurs  TARQUIN  Say'st thou the murmurs of the populace  Shall I be moved by th' manyheaded beast  No if thou dost not know these truths already  Learn them of me The grosser herd of men  Nature hath mark'd for servitude to bear  The yoke with passive neck and walk in trammels  Woe to the king who gives a tittle up  To th' unsoul'd brutal rabble He shall find  When 'tis too late and sorely rue his folly  Stop a wild horse when he hath slipp'd his bit  Stick close your knees and make him slack his pace  At your command guide him with gentle words  And tell him that he should not throw his rider  Who talks of liberty he means licentiousness  Let the fat soil put forth that dangerous weed  But one poor inch and you shall see it rise  With growth gigantic till it reach to heaven  And blast the golden firmament He knows  But little of mankind who thinks by mild  And gentle usage to exact obedience  What follows Mean opinion of his talents  Contempt then Discontent is quickly seen  To ope her muttering mouth close on whose heels  Treads bold Conspiracy and rank Rebellion  I know them well fond of variety  And novel change bold where they see no sign  Of opposition like the highswoln tide  Through every open gap they rush amain  I know them well the slavish animals  Let them but see the sternlyfrowning face  Of awful majesty let but authority  Lift high her iron whip and they will cringe  And creep before your face like spaniel dogs  Nor dare to wag a tongue or move a limb  Or even draw their breath or let the strokes  Of their quickpalpitating hearts be heard  I know them well they cannot bear indulgence  It breeds corrupted humours in their minds  And subtile venom which would blast the world  Like the wing'd plagueThe murmurs of the populace  Why let the populace still murmur on  Like the vague murmurs of the empty gale  They blow at random and soon pass away  You cannot trace the wrinkles which they made  On the smooth ocean's face 'tis the fierce voice  O'th' ruinating whirlwind which must rouse  The godhead from his deep abode and cause him  Display his angry trident  TITUS  Might I speak  I would presume to say Herminius meant not  Aught derogating from your power of majesty  But from his real fears and his goodwill  TARQUIN  I do not think he did but let him learn  Henceforth if he will needs produce his reasons  To produce better nor dare tell a lion  That he must not chace down his prey because  A swarm of gnats buz in the path he takes  ARUNS  There's one ere Tarquin tells his resolution  Whose sage opinion hath not yet been ask'd  TARQUIN  I beg his pardon and will ask it strait  Well kinsman Lucius what is thy advice  Shall we with speedy onset or delay  Subdue these Ardeates  BRUTUS  Humph humphNo no  That scheme won't doI have it here but cannot  Express myself in presence quite so full  As I could wish but e'er long time is pass'd  I hope t'acquaint you with a plan of mine  By which the greatest enemies of Rome  Shall sink before her but as yet excuse  If I conceal the principles I go on  TARQUIN  We do and render thanks for thy goodwill  And Lucius when thy plot is ripe acquaint us  Full many a year have we experience had  Of thy sagacity in admonition  And quick dispach in business'Tis determined  To slack the arm of war and give it rest  The sword be still but let pale meagre hunger  Scowl in their streets and let the torrid thirst  Parch them without remorse extremity  Must conquer and to that these haughty Ardeates  Must yield perforce Be't yours Horatius  And yours Herminius to acquaint the people  With our resolves tell them that tho' 'tis slow  Yet the possession of the town is sure  Enlarge upon the riches of the place  Which must be theirs if patience be but theirs  Quiet their murmurs if they will be quieted  If not our will is fix'd and dread example  Shall punish the seditious  HORATIUS  We shall do  As we're commanded    Exit  Tarquin  SEXTUS  Has any one seen Collatine this evening  HORATIUS  We saw him as we came towards this tent  He cross'd our way to th' right and we soon miss'd him  SEXTUS  He should be with us at our feast tonight  ARUNS  I know his haunts The gentleman of late  Since he was married is grown melancholy  No wonder that you'll say I'll undertake  To find him out however and produce him  At the appointed time    Exit  Aruns  SEXTUS  You'll sup with us  HORATIUS HERMINIUS  We shall my Lord  SEXTUS  And thou without all doubt  BRUTUS  I pray excuse me May I be excused  This once  SEXTUS  By no means Why I tell thee what  Thou art the life the soul of company  Such wit such humour and facetiousness  As thou possessest more especially  When the brisk flagon hath been circling round  And the young god with laughter in his eye  Expands the liberal soul why I would rather  Not feast for half an age than want thy company  Without thy flighty bursts of merriment  Wine would be quite insipid and the hours  Drag sluggishly their heavy heels along  BRUTUS  Say you so There's my hand if I don't meet you  And be as merry as the best of you  And rally with as good an air and smart  And cut my joke and laugh at it myself  As loud as you and shew the wit in my teeth  Call me an ass the stupid animal  I most abhor  TITUS  Strange that he should abhor  His nearest of kin  SEXTUS  Come let us hence this night our brows shall shine  With the gay glories of the god of wine  We'll seize the leisure which this calm shall yield  And for the foaming bowl lay by the spear and shield  If ne'er relax'd war's sinews would be faint  The bow is useless which is always bent    Exeunt omnes  SCENE II  Another Part of the Camp  ARUNS CLAUDIUS  ARUNS  Where was he when thou saw'st him Claudius  CLAUDIUS  My lord between the camp and where our troops  Possess the neighbouring heights where thrown across  The hasty brook a rafter bridge is seen  O'erlain with sod which totters as you pass  There where beyond a path winds up the bank  Trod only by the cottager who lived  Hard by at morn and 'eve while fortune smiled  Now exiled by our arms beneath an oak  Whose bare top of its leaves bereaved and trunk  Dented with thunder like a veteran looks  Who many a hard campaign hath weather'd out  Cover'd with scars yet tho' with sinews shrunk  And pithless limbs now bending o'er his staff  Still claiming veneration there lay Collatine  In musing wise a knotted root o'th' tree  Upheld him halfreclined his eyes were fix'd  Nor did he see me as I quick brush'd by  When I had passed the bridge I turn'd me round  And saw him suddenly spring from the earth  And dart into the grove where 'mid the boughs  And thickening underwood I lost him soon  ARUNS  And where hast thou been school'd Where hast thou got  This tedious dull prolixity this quaint  Descriptive fribbling coxcomblike minuteness  This web spun from the vacant brain O Jove  Lash me and lash me well these trite describers  These murderers of clear language and intelligence  I ask'd thee where thou mett'st with Collatine  Hadst thou but told me in the neighbouring wood  South of the camp say should I not have found him  As easily as now Besides the trouble  Of seeing in my mind a clumsy painting  Drawn by a bungling artist Pr'ythee learn  At least when I ask a plain question of thee  To give as plain an answer Gracious powers  And is the gift of speech of so small value  That we must lavish it away thus prodigally  As 'twere a trifling knickknack Oh reform  ReformNo words reform and hold thy tongue  CLAUDIUS  My lord to pleasure you in every thing  Shall still be my endeavour  ARUNS  No it will not  I bade thee but this moment lock thy lips  Why but because I liked thy silence best  But hence thou know'st the horse we saw today  Dost thou not recollect it Find me out  Its owner understand'st thou 'Tis the horse  Which I so much admired dost thou remember  The chesnut with the hyacinthin mane  Enquire me out its owner let him know  I would possess that horse  CLAUDIUS  My lord I will    Exeunt  SCENE III  A Grove near the Camp  COLLATINUS  alone  Whence are thy charms ambition I have look'd  With piercing eyes but none can I perceive  Why art thou so pursued by human kind  Is it that thou lift'st thy aspiring front  Despising earth and all her groveling sons  And bidding bold defiance to the gods  Is it that cruelty thy fostermother  Thou laugh'st at pity dropping the humane  And tender briny drop o'er sacred misery  Is it that like a whore thou leavest thy lovers  And to the first newcomer brought by fortune  Thy ancient bawd givest all thy joys the joys  Which unessential power presented to thee  Begot on lawless thirst of fancied greatness  For what is power if taught not its due aim  By widedispensing goodness What is greatness  If singular it stands selfvivified  Selftaught selfloving selfpossessing all  Center'd in self detach'd from what gives to it  Its substance its inestimable worth  And true original intrinsic value  The willing tributary love of those  Who feel its warm irradiance and rejoice  I see no graces in thy towering look  In thy unfeeling mind in thy deceit  And treacherous air thy sceptre sway'd in vain  And grandeur dazzling foolsThou cursed sorceress  Whose birth the furies smiled when they beheld  And shook their snaky locks Thou bane of peace  Of every pure and every holy tie  Connecting man with manCould prayers avail  Oh hear me heaven drive to her native hell  This harpy pest and chain her firmly there  That she may ne'er embroil the world again  But harmony may reign and peace and love  And friendship's bright unsullied maiden fire  And every grace and virtue  Enter  ARUNS  Whom have we here  Say man of melancholy mood what dost thou  Moping alone Beneath th' umbrageous boughs  Of this deep wood what secret wizard spells  Exert'st thou to enslave the struggling moon  To make the wolves howl and the shepherddogs  Start from their unsound sleep To make the trees  Set free their earthclench'd roots the rivers turn  Back to their source and the old bedrid earth  Tremble for fear Nay do not think I view thee  With dreadful apprehension Did thy eyes  Glance fire as sure I think the rays are dim  Thy mouth spit flames as sure it never will  Didst thou lead growling in thy right hand chain'd  Th' infernal tripleheaded dog as now  I think I only spy a pinebranch there  I'd tell thee with unterrified aspect  Thou art my prisoner Come along with me  Dost thou draw back What reason can'st thou urge  Sextus expects thee at his feast tonight  I am for thy appearance bound to answer  I heard that thou wert here and come to bear thee  Willing or not Come leave tonight thy love  Of solitude e'en in this place and meet her  Tomorrow morning if thou wilt and welcome  COLLATINUS  My lord I am not well I'm very sick  ARUNS  Sick and by what physician's wise advice  Walk'st thou expos'd to the damp evening air  Hangs not the dew upon the dropping leaves  And doth not Philomela at the pause  Of every pensive strain turn back her head  And wipe the trickling moisture from her wing  Go to thou art not sick  COLLATINUS  Indeed I am  ARUNS  Indeed thou art thy hand ah ah I know  A lover's pulse rather a wencher's ah  Were I to beat the bushes well around  'Tis ten to one but up the hare would start  There are three kinds of men whom I have found  Most notable that wayFirst your shy fellows  Who hang the head and if you speak to them  Are blushing ripe immediately Next those  Who shun society and swear that man  Is a curst creature whom they cannot live with  Thirdly and lastly all religious  Of all denominations These three kinds  Of men have all hot amorous blood which tingles  Through every vein and will not give them rest  Among the second thou comest in point blank  A mixture hast thou of the first and third  Though were the gods to shake thee thy religion  Might fall from thee for aught I know as fast  As leaves blown from a sapless tree in Autumn  COLLATINUS  Dost thou then think it hangs so loosely round me  Were it indeed bound with firm bands of brass  And knit with pins of hardest adamant  Whatever of religion I might have  Were Aruns but permitted soon he'd strip me  And leave me naked as himself  ARUNS  I own I have no notion of these tricks  These ceremonial farces sacrifices  Prophetic entrails truthforeseeing birds  Chicken who teach by hieroglyphic pease  And all the holy jugglings which our priests  Would fain persuade us owe their origin  To th' essences divineWilt thou deny  That Numa's nymph Egeria was a strumpet  Who met him often in a wood like this  COLLATINUS  What profits my denying or affirming  But say is Aruns likewise ignorant  Of that pure incense which the breast unspotted  Offers to heaven that fine ethereal fire  Which by the gods created first and placed  I' th' human bosom sed by the fair deeds  Of moral goodness rectitude and truth  Flies upward to its native origin  Hath he no notion of that holy instinct  Which bids us look with awe t'ward the great Ruler  Of heaven and Earth and of that conscious pleasure  Arising in the soul when bending low  In humble reverence we pay homage due  To the prime Power of all Who call'd us forth  From the abyss of nothing into being  Placed us above th' unthinking grazing herd  Gave to us reason by whose power we stand  Foremost of all his works lords of this world  Who framed the universe for us alone  And for our pleasure hung the flaming sky  With all its glowing orbs Adorn'd the earth  With fruits with flowers and herbs of various sorts  Fill'd earth and air and ocean's womb immense  With subject creatures who might yield him homage  Or be to him for food Hast thou no notion  ARUNS  Plague on thy notions Plague upon thy questions  Think'st thou the gods highthroned if such there be  E'er heed such sneaking abject twolegg'd animals  As thou and I are From our praise what glory  Can they obtain Or from our first existence  What satisfaction Speculative dreamers  May fancy things like these but chief your busy  Crafty pretenders who well know to soothe  The ear of ignorance tell these curious tales  They know to profit by't The easy fool  Swallows their canting potion glibly down  And looks on them as heaven's own oracles  'Tis all a jest a maygame or what's worse  Whatever knaves may teach or asses credit  Ease is the pleasure of th' immortal gods  And interest is the god of mortal men  COLLATINUS  Easy 'twould be to prove how ill they merit  The name of deities who sit inactive  In slothful state while chance that is while nothing  Governs the world and turns heaven's hinges round  To prove that man is from contemptible  Far far removed that there are some of real  And undissembled piety who feel  What they profess and from these feelings teach  Who in the exercise of their devotion  Taste greater joy than kings have power to give  Nor would for th' unlock'd wealth of the wide earth  Offend 'gainst that fixt monitor within  Easy it were these things to prove to ears  Of sober sense and serious meditation  ARUNS  Oh mock me not I am as serious  As father Winter when the cold northeast  Blowing between his shoulders through a chink  Brooding he sits and rakes the embers up  In his illfurnished heartTo prove it hence  Take it ye winds 'Tis my religionhence  Lighten'd of this now Collatine and I  May talk together without quarrelling  I know not what 'tis good for but to make  Men sour and splenetic I'll ne'er speak more  Or for it or against it Pr'ythee Collatine  Forgive me if in too impertinent  And bold a strain I spake in its defence  'Twas irony my friend sheer irony  I thank thee that thou didst retaliate  I see th' absurdity and bid a long  Adieu to it for everHold thy tongue  'Tis gone 'tis hence 'tis no where 'tis a theme  For priests for ideots thou hast cured me quite  I have no qualms not one away away  Adieu'tis wellAnd now my Collatine  I pr'ythee tell me nay without a jest  In earnest seriousness what dost thou here  And what employ'd thy meditations  When first I saw thee  COLLATINUS  Wilt thou tell me Aruns  How I shall answer thee for never yet  That I remember did I give to thee  An answer thou wert pleased withal if grave  'Twas mighty dull if gay 'twas vastly silly  E'en answer for me Aruns here I am  Look round what say the objects which thou see'st  What say the objects which thou left'st behind  ARUNS  The objects which I left behind are good  The objects which I see are good all's good  I should not speak at allA camp a wood  A wood a campWhy I might beat my brains  For ever e'er rouse up one new idea  Thou art indeed a moralizer thou  Canst pick a sentence out of every stone  And make the springy grass on which thou tread'st  Thy monitor I'm stupid fancy with me  Is long since dead to each external thing  I'm as indifferent as if they never  Fill'd up their corner of existence Blessing  Upon the Powers above who steel'd my nerves  And blunted every sentient faculty  So that in vain they'd dart before my sight  Their flaming thunderboltBut what of me  I from this time appoint thee my preceptor  I have improved already I'll improve  Still more tell me thy meditations  COLLATINUS  I will nor do I think what I'd not utter  To all mankind I wish with equal truth  All the whole world could say soI will own  I came not to the camp with my good will  I have no quarrel 'gainst the Ardeates  They never injur'd me nor do I know  A Roman whom they did but 'twas my duty  I was commanded and obey'd where danger  Raged in the fight I was not backward thou  Canst witness for me 'mid the foremost bands  I braved the ruffian DeathMy mind's my own  My service is my king's I own I pitied  Those against whom I fought nor wish'd to conquer  The brave the injured 'Mid the roar of war  I long'd for peace and when the fight was o'er  I would have found it in my tent but there  It was denied if I gave up one moment  To short reflection strait intruded on me  Shoals of your newcreated officers  Pert coxcombs who in words flame in the front  And stare each terror of the field i'th' face  Though when in arms halfdead they only know  Each motion by report these brother soldiers  For such they scruple not to call themselves  Worried my ears to death I left the camp  ARUNS  No wonder such as these disgrace the name  Of manhood oft I've seen them pale and wan  Not dare to lift an arm against the foe  Yet talk at such a swelling boisterous rate  As they would equal our god ancestor  And slay whole hosts alone  COLLATINUS  Quite discontented with myself and them  I hither cameI cast my eyes around  I saw the labours of the husbandman  Destroy'd I saw the smoaking villages  A thousand horrid thoughts of misery  Struck on my mind I heard a thousand groans  Of fathers mothers childrenI could not  Refrain from tears I could not as I live  To think that industry and innocence  And sweet content and genial homebred joy  Should from their native mansions be expell'd  And their possessors slain perhaps by th' hands  Of brutal violence or doom'd to lead  A life not worth the name the prey of want  Of woe of anguish 'twas indeed with tears  I thought upon it and each human glory  Faded before me  ARUNS  'Twas most lamentable  And melancholious I could weep methinks  At the relation had I not sworn solemnly  When some years since lost in the melting mood  I play'd the fool egregiously ne'er more  To weep at any rateThese are sweet feelings  I lose a deal of joy I know full well  By not indulging them but 'tis no matter  What a fine tale hast thou been telling me  Of troublesome companions dismal sights  And soft compassion melting into tears  Think'st thou I can't see through all these pretences  Once but not lately once when yet a boy  I felt I know not what of odd emotions  The peevish amorous whining doating god  Had with his arrow pierced my liver through  When absent from my love but not my wife  I sigh'd and groan'd and shook my pensive head  And sought out desert rocks and nodding pines  And murmuring streams to soothe my sickening soul  And if a friend by chance had found me out  And ask'd what ail'd me Ail me gravely said I  I'm pitying the vices of the world  And thinking of its follies though myself  Was then a child of folly and as true a one  As any she e'er bore a woman's fool  But do not weep again when these same wars  These cursed wars are over it shall see  Its own true love again yes that it shall  It shall it shall  COLLATINUS  Now may I die  ARUNS  No false professions good my friend die say'st thou  No live live while thou may'stwe stand upon  A hanging bank fast crumbling in the stream  Of headlong time if swoll'n by rains or vex'd  By raging winds perhaps an hour a moment  Sweeps us away and shall we aid ourselves  Each fatal accident Heap up a load  Upon our shoulders doubling our own weight  And plunging in the waves before our day  Likest thou the metaphor Come then with me  And we'll tonight laugh off these clogging weights  So that at least we will insure ourselves  Some twelve hours longer hence with discontent  Why should we purse our brows up when the hand  Of youth would keep them smooth Come we're expected  Sextus will have no Nay and go with me  Willing or not you must  COLLATINUS  Well I will follow  Go you before  ARUNS  No thou shalt with me go  If once the fowler cast aside his eyes  The stricken bird he thought a destined prize  Hides in the sedge he looks around in vain  The shy eluder ne'er shall he obtain    Exeunt  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  The Tent of  Sextus  SEXTUS TITUS ARUNS BRUTUS COLLATINUS HORATIUS HERMINIUS  And others as drinking after the Banquet  BRUTUS  pretending drunkenness  I Say it was not right it was not right    To  Herminius  And had you been in Greece you'd have learn'd otherwise  Contrary to all the rules of war Why look ye  SirWhat's your nameYou know no more o'th' matter  Than a crack'd eggA general indeed  What signify numbersSuperiority  I say superiority is a word  I have no complaisance forNo Sir none  And I would beat the Rutili though their armies  Were full of superiorities  ARUNS  He would indeed  You stand no chance Herminius if you talk  With Brutus on the art of war  BRUTUS  I think so  I think so truly let my head alone  For th' art of war I have a brain I have  Look yethe art of waris a fine art  You must not talk with me indeed you must not  No noHard grating task But 'tis the end the end  Lie still each spark of reason deep obscured    Aside  Beneath dissimulation's closedrawn veil  HERMINIUS  I humbly ask your wisdom's pardon Brutus  I did not mean offence and know in argument  I should come off with you at second best  BRUTUS  I do believe 't indeedthe art of war  You talk of th' art of war  SEXTUS  No more no more  Come fill your glasses round till they o'erflow  Here's to the art of war and noble Brutus  ALL  Here's to the art of war and noble Brutus  SEXTUS  Would I'd a crown of laurel here to bind  Around the brow of Brutus green as that  Which shades Apollo's everyouthful front  Ne'er fear'd by th' blasting light'ning or burnt up  By the sun's scorching rayBut I have none  What honours shall we give to noble Brutus  TITUS  Resign thy seat create him arbiter  And bend before him  BRUTUS  Yes I'll be arbiter  What we've more virtue's friends than one or two  Bacchus himself is but a fool to me  I will cry Iö longer than he shall  I'll teach you how to drink Come never flinch it  Here's to the cultivation now of Ethics  Ethos our Mos it is of Greek extraction  Aye and I'd have you all to know it too  I am a scholar that I am and learning  I suck'd it with my milk  COLLATINE  Aside    O miserable and degraded type  Of man unhandy and halffinish'd work  Of nature Is this a thing to laugh at No  I could not laugh though smiles were plenty with me  As th' hairs upon my head  SEXTUS  Come my good Brute why sit we still Our lips  Are thirsty and with earnestness desire  The beverage of the god put round put round  BRUTUS  We will so when we please Brute say you Brute  Are we not arbiter Are we not royal  King of the feastBrute Brute Sir in your teeth  What Brute indeed  ARUNS  Most noble arbiter  TITUS  Most royal king o'th' feast if it please your greatness  The dignity and height of your large excellency  SEXTUS  Most worthy and renown'd absolute Sir  BRUTUS  We're mollisied and bear not callous ears  SEXTUS  Come then here's to the fairest nymph in Italy  And she's in Rome  ARUNS  Here's to the fairest nymph in Italy  And she is not in Rome  SEXTUS  Where is she then  ARUNS  Ask Collatine he'll swear she's at Collatia  SEXTUS  His wife  ARUNS  E'en so  TITUS  Is it so Collatine  Well 'tis praiseworthy in this vicious age  To see a young man true to his own spouse  Oh 'tis a vicious ageWhen I behold  One who is bold enough to steer against  The wind and tide of custom I behold him  With veneration 'tis a vicious age  HERMINIUS  to  HORATIUS  True things are spoke in jest I like not this  HORATIUS  Nor I  BRUTUS  Aside    Our youths are waxing warmTo my feign'd part  Pretended sleep shall give some little pause  COLLATINUS  Princes I ask you not to stay  Your mirth though I'm the subject if to love  My wife's ridiculous I'll join the laugh  Though haply I shall not laugh at myself  ARUNS  The conscious wood was witness to his sighs  The conscious Dryads wiped their watery eyes  For they beheld the wight forlorn today  And so did Ibut I shall not betray  Here now he is however thanks to me  That is his semblance for his soul dwells hence  How was it when you parted SheMy love  Fear not good sooth I'll very constant prove  HeAnd so will I for wherefoe'er I steer  'Tis but this mortal clay my soul is here  SEXTUS  And pr'y thee Collatine in what array  Did the god Hymen come to thee How dress'd  And how equipp'd I fear me much he left  His torch behind so that thou could'st not see  A fault in thy beloved but hast since  Judg'd by the touch alone or was the blaze  So burning bright that thy bedazzled eyes  Have since refused their office  COLLATINUS  And doth Sextus  Judge by his own experience then of others  To him I make no doubt hath Hymen's torch  Discovered faults enow what pity 'twas  He had not likewise in his other hand  A mirror brought wherein t' have read himself  SEXTUS  'Tis well I like thee now and this I answer  Now thou art gay I will be mighty grave  And much we shall not lose by th' interchange  In sober sadness this my own experience  Hath taught me this is my opinion  Of which I would not give a tittle up  Though straitlaced Pallas should appear in person  That women are most dear delicious  Inconstant creatures artful amorous  Fruitful in schemes to please their changeful fancies  And fruitful in resources when discovered  Before assurance and a tongue wellhinged  They fall by thousands a strait back a leg  Wellturn'd and nimble cutting quick vaults well  A lively eye yet in their presence bending  As if o'erawed these with th' aforesaid graces  Will madden them by millions from the girl  Who feeds on chalk to the grave married matron  Who is so chaste forsooth she wipes her mouth  After her husband lest the breath of man  If settling there too long should taint her virtue  I use them as they are their native passion  I know is love of novelty however  Others more subaltern as love of riches  Grandeur and shew may seem to oversway it  Hence tho' they swear they love me wonderous well  After some little time I know the gentle  And pretty creatures heed not the strict truth  I know it is not for myself they love me  So delicacy bids me rove again  I please their darling passion and am bless'd  COLLATINUS  This is the common cant the stale gross idle  Unmeaning jargon of all those who conscious  Of their own littleness of soul avoid  With timid eye the face of modest virtue  All those who to the name of womanhood  Join dignity of soul and innocence  Unstain'd by inward base desire who flush'd  With triumphs over those they dare attack  The weak or forward those whose lines of feature  Proclaim there's no resistance to be made  Or those who spring obtrusive forth and meet  Halfway the doughty champions strait declare  And fain would make their shallow notions current  That womankind are all alike all arrant  And willing daughters of the game and hoot  At virtue wheresoever she passes by them  I have seen sparks like these and I have seen  A little worthless village cur all night  Bay with incessant noise the silver moon  While she serene throned in her pearled car  Sail'd in full state alongBut Sextus' judgment  Owns not his words and the resemblance glances  On others not on him  SEXTUS  Let it glance where and upon whom it will  Sextus is mighty careless of the matter  When to the moon we stray for similes  'Tis to be fear'd our wit is lunatic  However my intent went with my words  Now hear what I have seen I've seen some fathers  Who have with care kept up their daughters housed  For no deformity of mind or person  No not i'th' least though wherefore otherwise  They chain them thus heaven knows I have seen men  Who have these monsters married pardon me  I meant these extraordinary beauties  Young men indeed and novices that way  And they at such a rate have doated on them  COLLATINUS  Sextus no more lest I forget myself  And thee I tell thee prince  ARUNS  I tell you bothGreat king of gods and men  Why must we tonguetied sit and mute attending  To brawls like these Are these fit offerings  For Bacchus' shrine He peaceful god delights  In other gifts a plague upon you both  If ye must needs rail thus stay till tomorrow  And to it fastingCollatine think not  I discommend thy warmth it is becoming  TITUS  Indeed I rate it high in estimation  Fidelity in love is a rare quality  And merits praise but how much rarer is it  And more deserving praise in married life  Hold Sextus hold for shame  SEXTUS  Why pray good Sir may I not praise the wife  Of this same testy froward gentleman  Her shape slender and delicate her face  Breathing the air of beauty her sweet eyes  Their fire mellowly temper'd though I never  Beheld her in my life yet why might not  My tongue prompted by pregnant fancy form her  A type of excellent perfection  And from her person turning as I should  Had I not been withheld by interruption  Have on her many virtues descanted  But on his cheek offence must quivering sit  And dream'dof insult the abortive child  Of misconstruction whose nearsighted eye  Discerns not jest from real  COLLATINUS  And would Sextus  Persuade me that I am indeed so weak  As that my brain confused blends opposite  And sundry kinds of phantasies together  Letting go all distinction that I read  The acts and words of others always contrary  To their intent E'en think so there's no harm in it  I heed it not jest on I'll aid your humour  Let Aruns use me for his mirth and laughter  And Titus deck me with ironic praise  With all my care I'll foster the mistake  Nor shall my selfimportance undeceive you  But when you touch a nearer dearer subject  Perish the man nay may he doubly perish  Who can sit still and hear with sneaking coolness  The least abuse or shadow of a slight  Cast on the woman whom he loves though here  Your praise and blame are equally alike  Nor really add the least or take away  From her a hundredth minim of a grain  Of her true value more than they would add  To th' holy gods or from their state diminish  ARUNS  If that a man might dare to ope his lips  When Collatinus frowns he I presume  Without incurring censure of prophaneness  Or blasphemy 'gainst his domestic private  Conjugal goddess might enlarge upon  The qualities belonging to his own  I grant you that Lucretia is divine  I don't deny her apotheosis  Yet will I say my wife is not amiss  That is taken as a woman your divinities  Need not regard the duties of the house  Their minds are too sublime 'tis theirs to range  In quest of pleasure pleasure is divine  And mortals must not think to grasp at it  Yet as a woman could my eyes but reach  As far as Rome I make no doubt they'd see  My wife far otherwise employ'd and better  Far better as a woman than the deity  Residing at Collatia  TITUS  And mine beyond them both employ'd more careful  More housewife like  SEXTUS  Welltimed I'll seize th' occasion  View this Lucretia e'er I sleep and satisfy  My senses whether bruiting Fame says true    Aside  I'll stake my life and let us mount our horses  And post away this instant toward Rome  That we shall find thy wife and his and his  Making the most of this their liberty  What 'tis the sex enjoying to the full  The swing of licence which their husbands' absence  Affords I'll stake my life that this is true  And that my own ill as I may deserve it  Knows her state best keeps best within the bounds  Her situation claims that she is with her family  While yours are feasting at their neighbours' houses  Or rioting at homeWhat say'st thou Collatine  COLLATINUS  Had I two lives I'd stake them on the trial  Nor fear to live both out  SEXTUS  Let us away then  ARUNS  With all mine heart  TITUS  And mine  COLLATINUS  What mean you pray  You are not really mad  SEXTUS  He would retract  What he hath said but we'll proceed to trial  You go with us by Jupiter  COLLATINUS  Is't right  Think you had we a cause more urgent thus  To quit the camp Should Tarquin hear of it  SEXTUS  Oh heed not Tarquin pray you good Sir peace  We'll wing our horses well we may get there  And back again e'er the shrillsounding bird  Pipe to the morning star Yet e'er we go  Once let the flagon circle to our wives  What says our arbiter  BRUTUS  starting out of his feigned sleep  Wives aye aye yes yes wives there's mine  A paragon when time was aye and virtuous  Chaste as the lily aye and prudent too  And a good housewife sour a little or so  Tart tart and humoursome Sextus Tarquin Sextus  You old king's youngest son say am I drunk  I am not drunk by Saturn you are Aruns  No you are Sextus ah I love thee Sextus  I will be heard what dost thou laugh at villain    To  Claudius  who attends  I'm arbiter I say I'm arbiter  And to be laugh'd at Why Herminius  Laugh'd at why how what Oh  Pretends to sleep again  SEXTUS  What my unconquerable Brute again  Deceas'd quite gone Come crown the arbiter  The empty bowl sit emblem of the head  It sits uponCome let us haste to horse  I long to see this phoenix of her sex  This earthly deity this divine mortal  Who hath alone possession ta'en of heaven  And keeps out all the rest of women a plague  'Tis rather hard on them rather in her  Shews not an overburthen of goodnature  To hoard up all perfection in herself  Her qualities dealt forth among the rest  Would make them oreads dryads no contemptible  Objects of worshipCollatine why grave  Tut man thou'rt not the first that hath mistaken  A cloud for a substance women have fine outsides  Fair blushing cheeks and modestlooking eyes  And tongues more sostaye and hearts too hearts hearts  My Collatinus and in themCome come  Be gay  COLLATINUS  I am not sad  SEXTUS  But fearful for th' event  COLLATINUS  Not in the least  SEXTUS  A little  COLLATINUS  Not a whit  You do not know Lucretia  SEXTUS  But we shall  Come without more delay Do you along  Horatius and Herminius  HORATIUS  We are ordered  On duty by the king your father  SEXTUS  Well  E'en what you will  ARUNS  But what of Brutus there  Shall we take him with us  SEXTUS  Oh by all means  His shallow brain is soon o'erflowed with wine  And soon the quick tide ebbs and leaves him dry  We'll to thy tent Aruns let him sleep here  Just e'er we mount our horses we'll send for him  Though he's so poor a brute yet some how custom  Makes necessary vile society  Come will you hence    Exeunt  BRUTUS  alone  Poor poor indeed for no one is my friend  And I am friend to none but I say false  For I'm a friend to all mankind but tyrants  Yet have I never known the dear affinity  Which springs from mutual trust when the full heart  Bounds to meet heart ne'er felt the double joy  Caught from communication and fierce grief  Hath in my breast emptied his store of arrows  Nor have I dared seek out one kind physician  To pour his lenient balm Pitied by some  Laugh'd at by most by my own wife despised  Who for convenience wedded as did I  For sake of offspring Would to heaven I had not  For I have been no father to my sons  I could be none their minds unschool'd nay worse  Corrupt which they I fear and I shall rue  And let us rue it friendship I give up  And tear each private tie from my fix'd heart  Happy beyond all possibility  Of small contracted life could I achieve  That purposeCould achieve aye that is it  Why can I not achieve it Oh that gnaws  I feel it deeply hereThe tyrant lives  A politic tyrant curse on 's policy  Forever hath he kept the state in motion  Nor given a restingplace on which to set  A foot against him War eternally  Abroad or works of slavery at home  Busy the youth of Rome these last I know  Ill suit their freeborn minds and discontent  Sat lowering in their looks when they left Rome  The hopes of plunder only drew them thence  And that forced ardour cool'd by this delay  They murmur in their hearts and curse the power  And wild ambition which hath brought them hither  Enter  CLAUDIUS  Ho Brutus  BRUTUS  Say what would'st thou  CLAUDIUS  Come with me  BRUTUS  Thou might'st at least have said if I so please  CLAUDIUS  So please the princes did not please to say so  BRUTUS  Go tell the princes then whether they please  Or thou I beat thee thus and thus  CLAUDIUS  O Jove  I'll ne'er jest with a fool more when he's drunk  His wit lies in his hand  BRUTUS  Begone unless  Thou waitest for the other blow and please  To tell the princes I'll be with them strait    Exit  Claudius  BRUTUS  This bears a face HoldLet me seeTo give  These madmen now the slip and when they're gone  Rush in the midst o'th' camp put on myself  And with th' impetuous language of the soul  Rouse up th' enthusiast flame  The soldiers without doubt will see the change  With wonder and amaze and to possess them  Some god had wrought the miracle would be  An holy lie which they perhaps would swallow  And so their passions might be work'd t' a pitch  Even of desperation which would prove  Fatal to the archtyrant But these passions  Will soon subside and fond of novelty  They'll from the son expect a milder reign  And by fair words and silver promises  Again be bubbled and repent too late  And what becomes of me I die nought done  Or skulk away my life in banishment  For ever prey'd on by remorse not chear'd  By one faint gleam of what hath long sustain'd me  Hope and which still forsakes me not Besides  His sons may have possession of the city  And there are hostages the wives the children  Of all the soldiery sure certain pledges  Of their fidelity Of this no more  As I am known to none for what I am  To me all men are open and discover  Their inmost thoughts though not in words express  Yet in the speaking motions of their eyes  And lines of face in which my mind unseen  As th' airy ministers reads those of others  Valerius is the soul of honesty  Brave generous hating arbitrary sway  So is Lucretius so are th' prime o'th' army  Horatius and Herminius say to these  I should unsold myself I will Tonight  When I reach Rome I'll seek out the two first  And if I find on trial they are apt  Will lay some share o'th' load on them which I  Have borne so long alone I think together  E'er leaden time shall creep on many a day  We may contrive some glorious means to free  Our bleeding country from the savage gripe  Of lawless power heal all her festering wounds  And once again attire her in the robes  Of godlike freedom    Exit  SCENE II  Rome  LUCRETIUS  to a Servant  If any messenger comes from the camp  Or with particular and urgent business  You'll find me with Valerius otherwise  To whomsoe'er enquires give for an answer  That I am gone abroad you know not whither  SERVANT  I shall my lord  LUCRETIUS  This night in undisturb'd society  I'll commune with Valerius What a man  In whom I doubt which most t' admire the strict  Severity of manners he possesses  And unaffected virtue which might well  Become the days of yore e'er Saturn left  These our Hesperian fields and the just maid  Sought the supernal mansions or th' unfeign'd  And pious love he bears his bleeding country  Or the sincere strongbeaming warmth of friendship  Friendship Oh truly glorious name not that  Giddy and thoughtless which instinctively  Leads t'ward a fancied good deluded youth  By health begotten and quick flow of spirits  Oft fading from the moment it is born  Not that which courtiers deal in and the knave  Professes to his mate which lasts no longer  Than shines the sun of fortune but which proved  By true experiment and frequent use  Is found a settled principle a tie  Strength'ned by habit what is fair and honest  Link'd to what's fair and honest sure the man  Who knows not this is wretched he who knows it  Can ne'er be totally unhappy    Exit  Enter  BRUTUS  to the Servant  Belong'st thou to Lucretius  SERVANT  Yes  BRUTUS  I pr'y thee  Tell him unless business of consequence  Employs his time I fain would speak with him  SERVANT  He that would speak with him at present wants  What he's not likely to obtain  BRUTUS  Why so  If he's at home  SERVANT  But if he's not at home  My if for yours  BRUTUS  But know'st thou where he is  SERVANT  Perhaps I do what then  BRUTUS  Acquaint me where  He may be spoke withal  SERVANT  Bring you a message  Came you from Tarquin  BRUTUS  No  SERVANT  Then I know not  Where you can find him  BRUTUS  But he must be found  Matters of moment have I to impart  And what concern him nearly  SERVANT  Nothing material can he have I warrant  His company may always well be spared    Aside  I know not where he is nor can I give  Directions where to find him but some time  E'er midnight he'll return or if you stay  Until the morning chance is on your side  But you may see him  BRUTUS  Pr'ythee honest friend  SERVANT  Honest indeed but not a fool I trow  BRUTUS  Dost thou know me  SERVANT  Oh mighty well good night  I mean not to get cold by waiting on you    Exit  BRUTUS  alone  Thus 'tis we plan and thus our favourite schemes  Are blasted in the bud we travel on  The road of life we cast our sight far forward  We think we spy the goal our eyes are fix'd  And fancy gives us earnest of possession  Meanwhile ten thousand thousand accidents  Each as minute and imperceptible  As the fine floating threads of Midsummer  Obliquely cross us small yet strong as fate  Our progress is denied the nerves of action  Are firmly fetter'd as with idle toil  We strive to extricate ourselves dark night steals on  We fall and haply never rise again  Ne'er see the ruddy face of morn or lost  In fogs and mists rove darkling till arriv'd  At where we first set out we strive again  Again are baffled by the sturdy trifles  And sink at last fatigued and quite o'ercome  Into the arms of death Sorrowful thought  But yet in strictness trueCome life come death  He hath not lived in vain who so hath lived  To satisfy himselfPoor argument  In reason good in practice weakFor me  I am not satisfied nor will be satisfied  Missing the markTutThis is woman's play  Meer words meer wordsdeeds are the test of man  And there I fail a pufillanimous  Tame indolent vile drivelerBut cease cease  Can I command occasion Wrest the sway  Of mortal things from the strong rule of Heaven  And to my will bend the reluctant step  Of coy contingency O you high Powers  Into your hands do I resign myself  Might I be used the humble instrument  To free my country Oh how bless'd were I  If Rome must sink if I must live in vain  And die as I have lived I will not murmur  I'm nothing you are wise and just and good  Yet why not seek Valerius Heaven and earth  It is too late here come the rioters  I can't escape them yet a time may be  Yet hence despair still thou and I are twain  Enter  SEXTUS TITUS COLLATINUS ARUNS  ARUNS  May they all hang or starve or drown themselves  And may each several kind of death be mine  When I again presume to promise aught  Upon a woman's head  TITUS  We're trapp'd indeed  And Collatine will bear away the bell  SEXTUS  I do not think so man What though our wives  Love music there is music at Collatia  What though they love dancing and jollity  There are trim gallants at Collatia  What though they love feasting and revelry  Are they not feasts and revels at Collatia  ARUNS  But such a hubbub such a monstrous din  So wild a roar I never heard before  I could have sworn the frantic Bacchanals  Were come from Thrace The shrieks o'th' Sabine maids  When ravish'd were not heard so far away  As this shrill mirth I fear'd to pass the threshold  And trembled for my head yet it was well  That they were all together for it saved  Our precious time Yet do not triumph Collatine  Or rather triumph now for now thou may'st  Crestfallen shalt thou be anon  COLLATINUS  For me  To triumph were absurd more sober joy  Believe me shall be mine As for my crest  I trust a single fibre of the plume  Shall not be soil'd tonight  SEXTUS  We'll try that soon  Whom have we here Hah 'tis our runaway  Come hither fugitive where hast thou been  How daredst thou leave us What art doing here  BRUTUS  Doing here I was doing nought at all  At yonder corner of the street I miss'd you  And thought you turn'd this way  SEXTUS  My witty Brute  Give thee a possibility of wrong  And thou wilt ne'er go right  BRUTUS  I could not help it 'twas no fault of mine  I came this way and deem'd that I was right  Though baulk'd by fortune I could not attain  The soughtfor end But will you turn again  Toward my house Shall we not see my wife  SEXTUS  Thy wife without a doubt we'll see thy wife  But not at present some weeks hence or months  Will serve the turn and in the interim  Take heed thou givest her warning of our purpose  That she may be at homeNow to our horses  Come hurry it grows late I'm all impatience  To place this haughty Sir on an equality  With those he seems to mock a little hour  Will turn the laugh when he may dear repent  This fancied mastership  COLLATINUS  Proceed and try  Speak at your leisure  SEXTUS  So sanguine still so full of hopes  COLLATINUS  So sure  In stable knowledge  SEXTUS  Vain selfflattery  I'll hear no more haste haste Brutus before  And lead the wayTh' alertness of our chief  Methinks should animate us  TITUS  Certainly  ARUNS  It doth I haste with all convenient speed    Exeunt  SCENE III  Collatia  LUCRETIA  at work with her maids  LUCRETIA  I thank thee for thy tale Lavinia  Though little heeded it would raise my mirth  Sometimes though now I could not but retreat  To that which Clelia had before related  And didst thou know the youth my Clelia  CLELIA  Full well I knew him 'twas my sister's son  Oft e'er he died for he was long a dying  I went to see him oftimes he ran o'er  Each circumstance of his unhappy love  And the cold scorn which prey'd upon his heart  And when his cheeks were wan and his fair eyes  Which once the liveliest that e'er glanced the flame  Of ardent faithful passion were grown dim  And scarce to be perceiv'd when his strength sail'd  And in a low weak tone he call'd me to him  Entreated me if ever I esteem'd him  To keep the secret from the cruel maid  Nor offer his departed soul a violence  By giving of her pain then with a feeble  And trembling motion press'd my hand t' his bosom  Till I was almost dead as well as he  LUCRETIA  And what became of her I think thou said'st  She with remorse was seiz'd and at the hour  Of midnight starting from her bed sought out  The grave where he was buried  CLELIA  There she died  I think that with th' assistance of Camilla  I can make out a dittie which was framed  On that occasion but 'tis melancholy  And you have heard enough of woe already  LAVINIA  Oh for the sake of heaven keep to yourself  Your gloomy dirge remember that my mistress  Lies all alone she will not wink an eye  Or if she does will dream of them and wake  In sad affright  LUCRETIA  Oh fear not my Lavinia  Though much I like these tales of native woe  I have no superstition and no fears  Which will disturb repose How thou art moved  I know not but to me a pleasing calm  Succeeds these narratives of grief o'erpast  And though I sympathise when they are told  It is a joy I would not be without  For always in my mind Lavinia  The soft delight which feeling pity brings  Though but indulged a moment far excels  An age of wanton gay festivity  Which the vague soul enjoys not while it tastes  Clelia begin Camilla you assist her  BALLAD    Daughter of fruitless woe arise  And quit this yewtree's noxious shade  O'er Nature midnight brooding lies  And poisonous vapours load the glade  II  Ah gentle stranger leave I pray  A wretch with woe forlorn like me  I wish to be alone thy stay  Doth but augment my misery  III  Daughter of fruitless woe arise  The clouds of heaven begin to lour  The cold northeast now bleakly flies  And drives along the sleety shower  IV  Stranger in vain thou seek'st to move  This pillow shall support my head  This grave in which lies my true love  Ah when alas shall I be dead  V  Daughter of fruitless woe arise  Dost thou not know how vain thy tears  Canst thou recall him by thy sighs  Will he return to all thy prayers  VI  Stranger thou didst not know the youth  Nor yet the love to me he bore  Thou wert no witness to his truth  Ne'er heard'st thou his persuasive lore  VII  Too well I know my fruitless woe  Can ne'er recall his vital breath  But I to his embrace can go  And seek him in the house of death  VIII  Daughter of fruitless woe arise  Alas to ears all deaf I speak  Cold damps suffuse her dying eyes  Life's quivering beam forsakes her cheek  LUCRETIA  Thanks Clelia thanks Camilla In this humour  I'll pray unto the gods and then to rest    Aside  How wears the night my damsels Are your tasks  Near endedGracious Powers who enters here  My lord most welcome  Enter  COLLATINUS TITUS SEXTUS BRUTUS ARUNS  COLLATINUS  Welcome these my friends  Lucretia our right royal master's sons  Passing this way I have prevail'd with them  To honour our poor house  LUCRETIA  Welcome yourself  And doubly welcome that you bring such friends  To whom I offer silent thankfulness  My heart is full of joyRetire my damsels  And think on other work  ARUNS  Rather fair lady  You should be angry that unseasonably  And with abrupt intrusion we've thus broke  Upon your privacy  LUCRETIA  No my good lord  Those t' whom my love and my respect is due  Can ne'er intrude upon me had I known  This visit you perhaps might have been treated  With better cheer not a more kind reception  This evening little did I think my house  Would have possess'd such lodgers  TITUS  Rather lady  Such birds of passage we must hence tonight  LUCRETIA  To night Doth not my lord say no to that  COLLATINUS  I would Lucretia but it cannot be  If the house yields a small collation  To set before your guests I pray prepare it  We must be at the camp e'er morning dawn  An hour or two will be the utmost limit  Allow'd us here  LUCRETIA  With all the speed I can  I'll play the caterer though I am tempted  Would that delay your journey to be tardy  And prove a sluggish housewife    Exit  ARUNS  This is indeed a wife here the dispute  Must end Henceforth there's no comparison  I could have sworn it was not in my nature  To envy any married man his bargain  Nor do I envy thee but 'tis a wife  Of wives I can't but own a jewel pick'd  From out the common pebbles To have found her  At work among her maids at this late hour  Plying the needle is not strange at all  When I have seen what I beheld just now  And yet I could not have believ'd e'en that  But to be pleas'd at our rude interruption  Not to squeeze out a quaint apology  As "I am quite asham'd so unprepar'd  "Who could have thought Would I had known of it"  And suchlike tacit hints to tell her guests  She wishes them away this carriage causes  Some little wonderEnvy NoYesNo  I give thee joy my friend and yet her beauty  Might in some men raise envy but I know not  What envy meansThou'rt happy Collatine  Thou must be happy if thou know'st thy happiness  What think'st thou Brutus  BRUTUS  Happiness consists  In thought in thinking that's to say that happiness  Is ours if we are happythat's to say  We're happy if we think that happiness  Is ours then we are happy  ARUNS  That's all true  Or that's to say in verity thy words  Are truly wise the cream of rhetoric  And marrow of morality is thine  TITUS  I must express my satisfaction too  And glad I am that our dispute occasion'd  This journey hither if once Collatine  Complain'd of my ironic praise his conscience  Must tell him I'm sincere when I affirm  I think him bless'd beyond comparison  In such a peerless dame  COLLATINUS  Enough enough  The gods forbid I should affect indifference  And say you flatter me I am most happy  But Sextus heeds us not he seems quite lost  ARUNS  Regard him not these reveries you know  Are common to him He will soon recover  SEXTUS  to himself  Had she staid here till now I should have done  Nothing but gaze Nymphs goddesses  Are fables nothing can in heaven or earth  Be half so fair Venus in flesh and blood  Love's true divinity If such the charms  Which meet the eye Oh what delicious beauties  With what a frenzy of delightBut these  The husband must aloneto me the senses  Are bounded yet my warm imagination  Pregnant with rapture  ARUNS  Brutus go and wake  Yon absent dreamer  BRUTUS  What ho Sextus Sextus  SEXTUS  What ho Sir Brute Come Sir a Salian dance  Well done most brisk and active Why a nimbler  And lighter heel an attitude more graceful  I ne'er beheld by Jove I'll recommend thee  To th' priests and thou shalt head the band what say'st thou  And spite of thy nickname we'll have it posted  In flaming characters upon thy back  "This is a man" lest by thy motions cheated  The people take thee for a bearWhat mean'st thou  How darest thou laugh at me Am I thy jest  Say Sir  BRUTUS  I know not what you mean not I  I did not laugh Say did I Aruns Titus  ARUNS  You did I needs must say it  TITUS  And at him  BRUTUS  At him I never laugh'd at him in all my life  TITUS  Nay then thou didst at us  ARUNS  What dost thou see  In us ridiculous Are our faces changed  Look we like monkeys Are our noses flatten'd  And tails grown out  BRUTUS  Nay now I see you laugh  At me now are you not in jest I pray  Was you not Sextus Yes you think perhaps  I can't see through it when you laugh at me  But I perhaps read men a little deeper  Than you imagine  ARUNS  Why I never doubted  Of thy sagacity I always found thee  Most wise most apt shrewd quick and capable  Yet when thou pleasest to relax thy wit  Leaves me in doubt whether I should prefer  The mirthengendering friend or cool adviser  BRUTUS  That's spoken like himself now that's like Aruns  TITUS  Brutus I heard the strangest thing last week  BRUTUS  Aye aye What was it Tell me  Ar Brut Tit Coll  apart  SEXTUS  I must and willWhat then I do not care  Marriage A trick nature ne'er meant itmarriage  Why how dare any man assume a

thought he was a soldier of indifferent  Moderate valour 'twas reported though  A little fearful but being son to th' king  The common people dared but mutter it  SEXTUS  I thank you what you think me meditating  I know not but both now and heretofore  My mind was in the camp How wine could heat us  To such a mad exploit at such a time  Is shameful to reflect on let us mount  This instant and return  COLLATINUS  Now we are here  We shall incroach but little on our time  If we partake the slender fare together  Which will by this await us Pray my lords  This way  SEXTUS  Along I'll follow straitYe walls disclose not  My dark conceptions I'll ere long return  Till when my soul by this fierce sting tormented  Will rage  unsatisfied and feel  no rest    Exit  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV

would not  But force perforce he shall A slavea traitor  I'll have the horse were there a guard around it  Of fifty thousand men all of them knights  Aye and his head to boot  TITUS  What brother hath the wind affronted you  Talk you to air And chide the passing gale  For blowing in your face  ARUNS  He had th' assurance  To reason with me too but if I do not  Marr all his reasoning for the future may I  What Titus  TITUS  Even he  ARUNS  You see me moved  Would you have thought it Such a paltry base  I'llmanner'd groom A Roman knight d'ye call him  A Roman hinda vile unpolish'd hind  An unlick'd cub  TITUS  Say who is this my brother  ARUNS  Who is this He therewhat d'ye call him Fabius  A knight a villain but may all the gods  Lay on me all their heaviest punishments  If he within these two hours doth not treat  The hungry worms Nay and I'll mount his horse  The horse he loves so well the horse he would not  Part with to me I'll mount that very horse  And make him prance upon the very spot  Where his warm corpse lies buried and ram in  His earthen bed full closely round about him  Then see who'll reason who'll pretend to prate  Then see  TITUS  Why what is this I hear of Fabius  Of Fabius and a horse and threats on threats  Be calm be cool  ARUNS  I've not been in a passion  No not in the least but if I don't make him  A fearful specimen of my revenge  A lesson to be read with shivering horror  By all the knights i'th' armyIf I do not  Ne'er may my pallid cheek again be red  Ne'er may my wrinkled brow again be smooth  Ne'er may the flash of anger quit my eye  May my whole visage ne'er regain its turn  Of native feature If I'm not revenged  May all the complicated ills of life  Assail me  TITUS  Oh ye gods how passion alters  The noblest of your works And is this Aruns  Is this the son of Tarquin This the brother  Of Sextus and of Titus Fie fie fie  What turn'd a woman Had my wife thus raged  In impotence of words denied a bauble  I should not thus have wonder'd Oh for shame  Had'st thou desir'd what thou could'st not possess  I might forgive thee could'st thou not revenge  I might excuse this storming with thy tongue  But when thou may'st possess what thou desirest  And when revenge attends upon thy beck  Ready to punish insult why this clamour  This idle ineffectual rhapsody  Of empty words  ARUNS  Empty or not I reck not  I spake to please myself Must I be curb'd  By every one Not speak Nay Titus stay  You leave me not  TITUS  Then pr'ythee speak to th' purpose  ARUNS  I'll speak of this same horse no other theme  And of the baseborn varlet who bestrode it  A currish miscreant but that's no matter  Should one of Phoebus' steeds tire in his wain  This would supply its place A whoreson slave  I ask'd him if he would exchange with me  And bade him cull my studThe head so form'd  Answering in nicest symmetry each limb  Such harmony of shape Such just proportion  I ne'er saw strength with beauty so combined  An eye of fire A neck clad in effulgence  And glorious as the arched bow of heaven  He told me 'twas the only thing he loved  His sole delight his pride ask'd me if I  Would willingly give up the thing I loved  Suppose my mistress begg'd I'd not desire him  Was sorry that he must refuse me would I  Give him the best Italia e'er produced  Nay give him three for one in brief he could not  He would not part with itSuch a fine creature  It ne'er was got by mortal sire the dam  Must have been by the northern wind impregn'd  The grass bends not beneath his feet he's swifter  In his career than is a morning sunbeam  And graceful as the wing of Mercury  Sliding to earth upon an azure cloud  The herald of the gods A vital spirit  Informs each fibre and directs its motions  TITUS  Enough enough  ARUNS  No it is not enough  This horse is mine it shall be mine at least  I would not part with it for half a kingdom  Poor foolish Fabius Little doth he think  My minister of vengeance dogs his heels  When thou dismountest Fabius clap his neck  Speak lovingly to him as thou wert wont  Take thy last leave nor see the hand of death  Aim'd at thy unarm'd side  Enter  CLAUDIUS  ARUNS  Is the deed done  CLAUDIUS  Fabius is fled my Lord  ARUNS  Fled say'st thou Whither  CLAUDIUS  Suspecting as I think my Lord some ill  And conscious of his just deserts he rode  Toward the postern gate I follow'd him  Resolv'd to execute what you commanded  Far off upon the distant hills appear'd  A band of the Rutilian foragers  He both his spurs stuck in his horse's sides  Gave him the reign and mingled with them strait  They shouted wheel'd away toward the right  And soon escap'd my eye  ARUNS  Thou wert too slow  My purpose known thou should'st have put on wings  As quick as thought thou wert too slow too slow  CLAUDIUS  My Lord unless I had been more than human  And could have trod with step invisible  And swifter than the passing moments do  I could not have done more it was impossible  ARUNS  Impossible tut there's a word impossible  There's no such thing but in the vapid brain  Of fools and cowards Why thou sluggish varlet  Dost thou not know it  CLAUDIUS  What my gracious Lord  ARUNS  If thou dost not go hence about thy business  And dream of it by th' way    Exit  Claud  No matter tho'  He that lets slip an opportunity  Deserves to lose the sight of it for ever  'Tis but an accident it doth not signify  TITUS  Why thou art quite become the slave of humour  Tetchy and froward as a squalling child  Of two months old ever dissatisfied  Unless he feels the nipple in his mouth  Or cries himself asleep  ARUNS  Oh Heavenly Wisdom  I see thy shining progress mid the stars  Brightening the galaxy To thee the orbs  Pay adoration from their lucent spheres  Thou crown'st the everlasting fount of day  With dazzling radiance Thou lead'st on the year  The seasons in their varied liveries  And more than all the rest inspir'st the soul  Of thy warm votary TitusLet me feel  Oh sacred goddess but the faintest touch  Of thy benignity and I will look  With such a gravity an air so solemn  As doth thy bird from out the hollow oak  Circled with clasping ivyOh what pity  That I should pray in vain who pray so seldom  What then remains To hurl a curse or two  At that blind strumpet Fortune who takes care  Always to break my shins with her damn'd wheel  To laugh in spite of her a peevish laugh  To wish all men no happier than myself  To wish that I were such a fool as Brutus  As they are happiest whose sense is smallest  Since I can't be so wise so sage as Titus  And so farewel I'll e'en go to my tent  And try if I can sleep out this long siege  For waking slumber is the worst of sleep  And so farewel  TITUS  Farewel  ARUNS  But stay inform me  If all thy gravity and wisdom knows  Where Sextus leads his vagrant feet Last night  I miss'd him Privately as I'm inform'd  He left the camp but for his destination  I could not learn it know'st thou  TITUS  No I know not  ARUNS  I might have guess'd so 'twere a thing as easy  To say when last Jove put on his disguise  Slunk out at heaven's back gate and what Alcmena  Received him to her arms A plague on secret  Mysterious hidden letchery I say  Why can't a man be open in his dealings  Give me the easy fair who will not blush  Though the broad sun should stare her full i'th' face  A plague on pains taking Your fly intriguers  Are th' only whoremasters all the rest are chaste  And fornication is necessity  Imagination must forsooth be tickled  Your squeamish stomachs must be tantalized  E'er they'll be hungry Hence your amorous parlies  Whispering from windows squeezing of the hand  Glances the lewd interpreters of thought  Hence all the monkey tricks which e'en the woman  Who causes laughs atFoh I'm sick to death  Such worse than asses in the shape of men  A pimping pleasure too not worth the toil  Of stretching out an arm thus far When Juno  Will be my paramour I'll turn gallant  Get me a pair of wings and every night  Mount up to her etherial bedchamber  Till when I leave intrigues to thee and Sextus  And so farewel I'll to my contemplations    Exit  TITUS  I know thy contemplations well beneath  That garb of chiding spleen and discontent  Ambition couches though thou seem'st unsteady  As the vague moon now gay as Florio spring  Intent upon delight now clouded o'er  And four as bleak December rating i'th' morn  What thou i'th' evening prized'st yet the eagle  Looks not with eye more fix'd upon the sun  Than thou on royalty I've seen thee through  And Sextus is not so enslaved to pleasure  But that ambition claims the upper seat  In his aspiring mind I've seen through both  Three kings at once no that can never be  One only bird arises from the ashes  Of the imperial phoenix in the sky  There's but one glorious light Let Tarquin die  And these young scyons must not spoil the growth  Of th' elder towering oak t' o'ertop their heads  And keep them down cannot perhaps be done  They grow too quick But still they may be blasted  The cankerworm may prey on them in secret  Or one good blow of a keen axe urged home  In all their pride of foliage lays them low  But peace Sextus I see is near at hand  Enter  SEXTUS  Sextus well met What you've I'll warrant you  From when the sun left his wavequilted couch  Full of anxiety and watchful care  Been traversing the camp How stand the soldiers  Affected to their duty Dost thou think  Our ditch and palisades will guard us well  And is the rampart strong in every quarter  Or hast thou been a spy toward the city  Keep they the guard o'th' wall with usual strictness  Hast thou found out a weaker place unknown  Or hath thy working brain yet wove the net  Or limed the twig or dug the fatal pitfall  For their destruction  SEXTUS  Every hour of time  Hath got its business allotted to it  There is an hour for war and vigorous action  There is an hour for counsel and advice  There is an hour for wine and noise and madness  There is an hour for pleasure and the feats  Which wanton Venus ever joys to look on  Last night my Titus  TITUS  Was the hour of time  When Sextus  SEXTUS  Pr'ythee take the fact at once  Lay with LucretiaWhy that mooneyed stare  Lay with LucretiaDost thou understand me  Lay with LucretiaNeed I to repeat it  'Tis what my tongue could dwell upon with rapture  Through th' infinite descent of rolling ages  Let my eyes sparkling with the newcaught joy  Let my cheeks stain'd with a more genial hue  Let all the dancing transports which play o'er  My face let these two arms which held her close  In twined embrace let these two lips which kiss'd her  Suck'd in her charms and now still taste th' impression  Let every atom of this body tell thee  That I enjoy'd Lucretia  TITUS  What the wife  Of Collatine thy friend thy kinsman  SEXTUS  The wife of Collatine my friend my kinsman  Nearer related now indeed than ever  But what is Titus' conscience then grown squeamish  Was it debauch'd last night that 'tis so sickly  So puling in the morning  TITUS  Not a whit  But struck with some astonishment however  Lucretia and the wife of Collatine  By her consent too  SEXTUS  Yes  TITUS  By some sly trick then  Some damn'd insidious circumvention  Some dark thick plot some artifice closecouch'd  Of cunning stratagem or else through fear  Of some worse ill than death Say now how was it  For if there ever was among the sex  Or purity or innocence 'twas there  She could not be a hypocrite her face  Her look her outward manners spake a heart  Unknowing of deceit a soul of honour  Where frozen chastity had fix'd her feat  And unpolluted nuptial sanctity  I do suspect thee much 'tis but a boast  Or else an act of low of mean revenge  To blast that virtue which thy utmost efforts  Can ne'er subdue  SEXTUS  Sextus is wont to boast  Of favours which he ne'er received or take  A pleasure in thin unsubstantial mischief  TITUS  No I acquit thee there  SEXTUS  E'en as thou wilt  But I suspect shrewdly thou enviest me  Which more to raise know that this soul of honour  This piece of unthaw'd snow this pattern rare  Of nuptial purity I found to be  A woman found her all alone at midnight  Found her in bed undress'd found her reluctant  Found her indeed chaste to outrageousness  Tho' that but added fuel to the flame  Yet used no violence and yet enjoy'd her  TITUS  Thou talk'st in riddles  SEXTUS  Hear then the plain truth  Now two nights since when first we saw Lucretia  Her air her voice her look her every motion  Inkindled passion in me e'en to madness  Thou dost remember how my soul was buried  In senselessness to every object round  Though then perhaps thou didst not guess the cause  I swore then to possess her All that evening  She unadvisedly with new incentives  Stirr'd up my purpose but quite unresolved  How to pursue that purpose I last night  Again went thither only one attendant  Accompanied me business of importance  Feign'd for my quick return Her husband's friend  And Tarquin's son she could not but receive  A nightly guest yet in her eye methought  She bore no great goodwill to Tarquin's son  She without doubt had heard his character  And hard 'twas to dissemble I nought heeded  This air of coldness but with sage discourse  And temperate entertain'd her talk'd of modesty  Of selfdenying virtue of strict honour  And mutual holy faith 'twixt man and man  Of wedlock's happy league and the young brood  Of smiling innocents then turn'd my talk  To battles sieges dreadful deeds of arms  Adventures rare by martial prowess won  A subject to the which all womankind  Open a greedy ear but not a word  Of love nor yet a sally of loose thought  Escap'd me thus I fell in with her humour  And unsuspecting she retired to rest  TITUS  And whither thou But I'll not interrupt thee  SEXTUS  Now was the depth of midnight silence reign'd  Through all the house not the least sound was there  You might have heard a feather fall to the ground  And sleep on every brow had fix'd his dead  And leaden hand as Nature lent her aid  To my design Kind Nature lent her aid  Nor I refus'd the call with cautious tread  Suppose thou seest me entering the room  Where lay that sleepy Venus in one hand  My sword a lamp in th' other think thou seest me  Reading her naked charms think but thou canst not  It is impossible had'st thou not seen her  What I then felt my soul was all on fire  My limbs all trembled and my salient heart  Beat as 'twould find a passage through my ribs  Half between sleep and wake Lucretia cries  Art come my lord But when she thoroughly waked  What a wild look of horror and surprize  She knew my purpose well or if she did not  I kept her not in long suspence nor wasted  The time in vain apology my sword  Threatened her instant death without compliance  And willingly she cried yes willingly  I'll die ten thousand deaths Oh my dear lord  Where where art thou Oh Sextus I conjure thee  By every sacred every tender name  Make me not despicable to myself  But slay me and I'll thank theeAll that feeling  Passionate nature could suggest she utter'd  TITUS  And didst thou still proceed Didst thou not find  Thy bosom mov'd  SEXTUS  I did but with desire  For fear had from her every other thought  Remov'd her hair dishevel'd hid but loosely  Her blaze of beauties as she kneeling strove  To clasp my knees I rais'd her and embraced  She shriek'd aloud fearing she might awake  The menial train I had but one resource  I rush'd forth to the door where I had placed  My trusty slave and dragging him by 's locks  Swore I would slay them both upon her bed  And publish to the world I caught them there  I'th' act of shame she found resistance vain  The conflict 'twixt the dread of public infamy  And private crime inwrapp'd her in despair  I mark'd the strugglings of her soul and seiz'd  The joy she would but dared not to refuse  TITUS  Thus having spoke forever hold thy tongue  My breast is not cast in that tender mould  Strongly to feel the goadings of compunction  Nor have I dealt in those punctilious niceties  Which bind the vulgar But this act of thine  Almost calls up the water in my eye  And raises new emotions in my heart  For her I'm touch'd with pity and on thee  I look with something tending toward horror  Oh hold thy tongue ne'er mention what thou'st done  Lest that the very earth on which thou tread'st  Cry out against thee  SEXTUS  This rebuke from thee  This to a stranger urge to him who knows thee not  And he may be deceived I can't but laugh  When I behold hypocrisy array'd  In th' unbecoming robe she stole from virtue  Not hiding half her nakedness Come swear  By all the gods and gulp down th' perjury  That all thy life hath been inculpable  That thou hast never broke the chains of wedlock  Nor ever wilt and then to prove thy truth  Lust after the next Roman dame thou seest  And as thou'rt wont pursue her to possession  TITUS  Whatever artifice I may have used  Howe'er with bribes corrupted or with prayers  Assail'd the silly soul of yielding woman  Ne'er did I use the argument of force  SEXTUS  Because thou never met'st with the temptation  TITUS  'Tis just I well deserve his infidelity  Nor have so lived as to be credited    Aside  But setting this apart dost thou behold  No future perils from this bold effect  Of unrestrain'd desire Compell'd to suffer  What she detested in the frantic rage  Or deep despair of violated virtue  May she not to her husband or her father  Disclose the cause  SEXTUS  What then thou think'st her something superhuman  Did I not tell thee that she was a woman  And on my life she'll act like any woman  With words like these she'll lull her frantic rage  And puff the depth of her despair away  'Tis done and can't be undone 'tis not known  So there's no harm guilt is no guilt in secret  Why should I make myself a wretch by blabbing  Why tell my husband what he can't find out  Sextus must love me wonderfully well  Or he would ne'er have undergone this hazard  No marvel though when beauty such as mine  Enticed him then she looks upon her mirrour  Vanity shews her figure passing fair  She smiles and thus proceeds beauteous as ever  Why what a peevish thing this virtue is  And Sextus is a prince and what is Collatine  Now comes she mark me to comparisons  What's Collatine A private man Ambition  Now flits before her eyes and she is blinded  To hold the prince a captive in her chains  Grandeur is hers and pomp and dignity  And all the world holds dear and precious  Oh your strongworking passions ne'er last long  She cool'd e'er I had mounted on my horse  E'er I had rode ten paces she saw things  In the same light which I have represented  And now no longer coy reserv'd and stubborn  Sends off a messenger t' invite me back  Oh I shall riot after this my Titus  And shall possess her to satiety  TITUS  If thou art not found a deceitful prophet  I'll give up all pretensions to the reading  Any event hereafter It can't be  I wish we may not all repent of this  At least I see perplexity and trouble  Which will ensue inevitably  SEXTUS  Whence  Can danger come Her father and her husband  And will they dare to think of a revenge  They may as well contrive to wrest the club  From th' hand of Hercules But lest mischance  Should work a miracle as for the husband  I'll give e'er long a good account of him  If he doth not meet death placed in the way  Of every mortal sally there are means  To bring him to his grave and mother earth  Is a most admirable vengeancecooler  As for the father riches are a crime  Which th' hand of Tarquin never fails to punish  Upon due accusationBut our father  Hath he enquired for me Or found me absent  TITUS  I do believe he hath not  SEXTUS  Well we'll go  This instant to his tent from thence to mine  Where we will hold some farther intercourse  Touching these loose imperfect hints I've offer'd    Exeunt  SCENE II  COLLATINE BRUTUS  COLLATINE  No moreMy business is not of that consequence  Or private nature but that thy society  Upon the road will be acceptable  Nay and when we arrive at Rome we'll go  Together to the dwelling of Lucretius  And I'll take care no servant shall again  Refuse thee enterance what then would'st with him  If thou wilt not reveal keep to thyself  I shall not trouble thee  BRUTUS  Whate'er it is  You'll know in time perhaps too with no small  Degree of pleasure  COLLATINE  Yes it may be so  Enter a  MESSENGER  Whence comest thou thus begrim'd with dust and faint  And breathless with fatigue How is Lucretia  Is all well  MESSENGER  I know no more than that I bring this letter  Which I was order'd to convey to you  With utmost speed another messenger  Was sent at the same time with the same orders  To Rome unto Lucretius  COLLATINE  Reading  A deed too dreadful for my pen to write  Extremitywithout delaybring with you  One only friendEternal gods what means this  A friend the time is precious I'll take him  A moment can't be lost to cull and choose  Wilt thou with me Lucius I know thou wilt  Haste then this moment bring our horses forth  What dire portending mystery My mind  Attempts in vain to fathom itIf sickness  That cannot be she would have told me so  Her father sent for too with equal speed  Thought wastes but time come Lucius hence with me  We go not now to Rome but to Collatia    Exeunt  SCENE III  Collatia  LUCRETIA  alone  Oh agony of agonies down heart  Down swelling bosomO shame shame shame  Cover'd with shameOh conscious innocence  Where art thou fled Long inmate in my breast  Are we forever parted Shall my soul  No more attend thy gentle whisperings  Or when I rise in early morn or when  I seek my bed of slumber where by thee  Shadow'd calm sleep and happy dreams were mine  No more No more Must I ne'er see again  My husband's face with joy Ne'er to my heart  Strain him with rapture While he too with joy  Would listen to my tale of tenderness  No never never No Lucretia  Thou that wert once chaste pure and virtuous  Art now polluted vile abominable  How I detest myself wretch that I am  How loathsome to my soul which fain would fly  From out its odious prisonWhy had I not  Braved the adulterer's sword So had I fallen  A spotless victim Yet so too my name  Would have been render'd infamous declared  A most abandon'd prostitute no tongue  My vindicator and the bleeding proof  Of my supposed sin weltering by my side  Bitter alternative dreadful to think on  Turn turn reflection for across thy course  Lies madness and each desperate deed of frenzy  I cannot bear it  Enter  LAVINIA  Say did you call my mistress  LUCRETIA  Nobegone  Yet stay come hither is thy lord arrived  LAVINIA  He is not madam  LUCRETIA  Would to heaven he were    Fixing her eyes on the ground  LAVINIA  What fatal accident hath caused this misery  I know not but so good so kind a mistress  Never had servants never till this instant  Heard I a word expressive of impatience  Come from her lips Good heavens what load of grief  Works in her breast and labours for its birth  Would that I could remove that look of woe  From that sweet face I would myself endure  No small misfortuneThat still silent anguish  Pierces me through I'd speak to her but sobs  Won't suffer me  LUCRETIA  What ails thee Art not well  Why dost thou weep  LAVINIA  Ah can you ask me madam  What ails thee do I not behold you miserable  LUCRETLA  I am indeed LaviniaBut thy lord's  Arrival will heal allI pr'ythee go  And quickly to the end o'th' garden wall  And when thou seest him at a distance haste  And bring me word  LAVINIA  I will Oh you good gods  Give her relief Pour comfort in her bosom    Exit  LUCRETIA  That was a look of prayer of prayer for me  May it with blessings fall on her own head  A thousand fold For me the time is o'er  Fruitless are all petitions unless Jove  Could bid the past be as it had not been  Could render void existence root out memory  Poor honest wretch I could methinks drop tears  In sympathy with her but for myself  Not one have I to spare my grief's too great  'Tis all within no tears but tears of blood  Can speak my feelings or wash off my guilt  What though with all th' abhorrence virtue knows  When forced to look on sin I saw the deed  Yet 'twas committed 'twas permitted too  Fatal necessity Oh wherefore was I  Form'd all alive to honour's nicest sense  Why from my mother's breast did I imbibe  Its generous pride Why foster it with care  Brood over it delighted hold it here  More precious than a diamond of price  If thus  Enter  LAVINIA  LAVINIA  Madam my lord is just arriv'd  With him your father and Valerius  And Lucius Junius  LUCRETIA  'Tis wellTremble not heart  Keep fast thy fix'd intent form'd from that moment  This dagger's point is sharp but sharper far  The tongue of calumny its wounds more painful  Sharper the loss of that selfsatisfaction  With which in th' happier days of purity  Thou could'st thyself contemplate and admire  Can I endure to move the spectacle  Perhaps of insult and exulting baseness  Glorying o'er humbled virtue Can I bear  To see the gaze of curiosity  The nod the whispers Or to be at all  Mark'd out as something that's peculiar  Or can I bear myself and my own thoughts  No thou must die Lucretia thou must die  Hark hark 'tis theyHow shall I bear my husband's  And father's faces Oh support me heaven  This once support me in this interview  The thoughts of which almost take life away  Oh how shall I go through it  Enter  COLLATINE LUCRETIUS VALERIUS BRUTUS  COLLATINE  How is't Lucretia  How does my dearest wife  LUCRETIUS  My daughter say  Why hast thou sent for us  LUCRETIA  Nay come not near me  Thou must not call me wife thou my dear lord  Prized by me as my soul nor thou my father  Whom from my infancy unto this day  I have beheld almost with adoration  Thou must not call me daughter thou Valerius  Must not call me thy friend nor Lucius thou  I am not now myself cut off deprived  Of every near relationship each name  Of tender estimation I am lost  Lost to my friends lost to myself  COLLATINE  What accident  Of more than human power can cancel thus  Thy interest in my breast I must embrace thee  Press thee close to my heart call thee my wife  My best beloved faithful wife Assure thee  That all thy grief is mineOh calm this extasy  Thou shak'st all o'er as in an ague fit  And deadly pale now throws upon thy cheek  A hue like to the grave now suddenly  Glowing with hot vermilion  LUCRETIUS  Oh Lucretia  Believe me when I tell thee not thy mother  Was dearer to me when as chaste and pure  As Dian's self blooming in innocence  I led the virgin to her bridal bed  Than thou her pledge and lively pourtraiture  No nothing can withdraw my love from thee  While like that pattern of her sex thou livest  And so thy life hath been in thee wellpleased  I have beheld her form revived her virtues  And femalegracing ornaments of soul  LUCRETIA  There was a time when praises from that mouth  Would have thrill'd thro' my secret mind with pleasure  Tuned to harmonious selfcomplacency  Discover'd in each corresponding action  Wing'd with alacrity and joy But now  'Tis far far otherwise Thou good old man  These words have pierced me to the quickMy pain  Was keen enough before why would'st thou make it  Doubly excruciating Why bring my guilt  In stronger colours to my view  COLLATINE  Thy guilt  Not heaven itself is freer from all taint  Of guilt or the least stain of blame than thou  Is reason thine  LUCRETIA  Reason is mine indeed  Though I could envy those who are distracted  The mad is happier on his bed of straw  Than the poor wretch bereaved of innocence  Who yet esteems that innocence though lost  And who with fixed eye gazing on her  Is hurried into evil  LUCRETIUS  Explain thyself  How dreadful is thy prelude keep not thus  In torturous suspence thy father husband  And friends  LUCRETIA  Oh would one word could tell it all  Can you not guess the whole when I name Sextus  The youngest son of Tarquin  BRUTUS  Aside    Curse on the name  I fearI fearLuckless undone Lucretia  VALERIUS  Say what of him  LUCRETIUS  Speak daughter speak  COLLATINE  From him what ill could flow to thee Thou never  Saw'st him but once and that the other night  Brought here by me say what is this Lucretia  LUCRETIA  Would I had seen him but that other night  Or would that other night that I had died  A sudden death But a sad fatal night  Hath pass'd between Oh tongue perform thine office  And tell my husband that these eyes beheld him  That second night tell himOh Collatine  Oh hide me hide me from myselfHow vain  No let me stand and dare your piercing eyes  With bold assurance wherefore are they fix'd  All fix'd in silence on the ground On me  Direct them full Lo here I stand the mark  Of shame of ignominy  LUCRETIUS  Daughter patience  If without thy consenting heart this deed  LUCRETIA  No 'twas by my consent He would have slain  His slave and me laid both on the same bed  Then publish'd to the world that I with him  Was a vile base adulteress  LUCRETIUS  Oh woe is me Off off ye hoary hairs  Oh daughter ruin'd Ruin'd yet in virtue  COLLATINE  Burst heart Oh how shall I find utterance  VALERIUS  Damn'd be the wretch Doubly and trebly damn'd  When forth he walks may the red flaming sun  Strike him with livid plagues May he be shunn'd  By all mankind be odious to himself  Breed vipers in his conscience gnawing vipers  Wish hourly for his death yet be in tortures  A thousand years expiringIf this fate  Attends on virtue let us to the stews  For wives bring up our daughters prostitues  No more let holy wedlock be esteem'd  But rank commixture like the general herd  Of beasts inform the dwellings of mankind  BRUTUS  Aside    Oh noble warmth from forth a generous mind  With such a colleague might I shake the Tarquins  From off their throne Now is the time arrived  But staynor yet let me unfold myself  COLLATINE  When came he hither Say Lucretia  LUCRETIA  Last evening in the dark Affairs of consequence  Brought him he told me to Collatia  My soul above suspicion thought no ill  I entertain'd him as became myself  And him At midnight to my chamber stole  The ruffianWitness all ye powers above  I heeded not the sword which arm'd his hand  I pray'd for death with greater earnestness  Than the departing miser prays for life  He told me of his love his odious love  Intreated promised intermingled threats  Assail'd on every side my woman's soul  At length dragg'd in his slave and would have slain us  Together on the bed  COLLATINE  Oh fool fool fool  Vainglorious boaster that could'st not conceal  Thy treasure but rather than not be known  To be possess'd of wealth must take the thief  The first notorious thief thou met'st and shew him  The glittering store unhooded let him trace  Each winding avenue and give to him  A guiding clue by which whene'er he pleased  He might return and bear it all away  Oh my Lucretia all the fault is mine  To me may guilt with justice be imputed  Thou art as free as the young innocent  Hid in its mother's womb  LUCRETIA  Yes Collatine  Believe me when I tell thee not the least wish  That e're was form'd in deepest secrecy  Hath my soul breathed toward another man  Yet though my mind is free my body's guilty  The load from thence recoils upon my mind  Which shrinks beneath as shunning intercourse  With its polluted yokemate Death must break  These links of union e're she can be happy  LUCRETIUS  What say'st thou Death Oh daughter hold I charge thee  The thought is horrible it harrows up  My soul committing there the wildest waste  I charge thee if thou hast the least regard  For this old hoary head which many a time  When thou unconscious young one slept'st full sound  Hung o'er thee and survey'd thy infant face  With tenderness fondest love unsay that word  Let me conjure thee by thy mother's memory  By all her soft anxieties for thee  Her sleepless nights and busy days attendant  Upon thy welfare from thy breast unharbour  That rash intruding thought  LUCRETIA  Can any word  Fall from that tongue unheeded by thy daughter  But death's the only test the only evidence  I now can give of my integrity  And undefiled intentions  COLLATINE  No one can  Suspect thee my Lucretia hesitation  Will not against thee dare to elevate  Her stuttering tongue No many happy days  Shall yet be ours many sweet social years  Blessing and bless'dand our delighted children  Alas what sudden thought what new emotion  Scatters a wilder terror o'er thy face  Dyed with a deeper pale  LUCRETIA  Didst thou say children  Oh 'tis a thought which darted cross my brain  Like to the blasting lightningChildren saidst thou  Who knowshow ifthe ravisherThat thought  Would of itself determine As to him  Be't yours to judge what chastisement is due  For me when I am dead the babbling world  Perhaps will do me justice in your minds  At least my memory shall survive unsullied  Though I absolve myself from wilful crime  I can't from punishment nor shall a woman  Hereafter by the example of Lucretia  Outlive her loss of honour    Stabs herself  COLLATINE  Oh hold thy handWhat dost thou'Tis too late  Who could have thought so suddenly Rash action  Too surely doneThat groan life issued with it  Oh could my arms bring back thy fleeted breath  Thus ever would I hold thee even thus  In one indissoluble union  Ne'er to be sever'd would we live Lucretia  That blow hath kill'd us both Oh wife wife wife  LUCRETIUS  Horror of horros Wherefore did I wed  Why get a daughter Why with pride elated  BeholdOh ruin'd virtue Damned monster  Had he e'er lov'd a child with my affection  No breathquite still and silentCome Despair  And welcome to my breastFix'd are her eyes  Ne'er shall I drink their genial beams again  Ne'er hear that voiceNow now could I blaspheme  Oh godsPatience patiencehere I stand  Mute and resign'd to your eternal wills  But is it thus the good meet their reward  Art  thou  my daughterOh oh oh  VALERIUS  No tongue can blame this grief Thou gentlest best  Bedeck'd with every grace each ornament  Which dignifies exalts  BRUTUS  grasping the dagger  Now by this blood I swear immaculate  Before the Tarquin rape and you Oh gods  Bear witness to my oath that I'll pursue  With fire and sword and every other means  Which righteous indignation shall supply  Tarquin the proud his impious wife his sons  And all th' accursed race nor suffer them  Or any other to be kings in Rome  If that I break one tittle of this vow  May death be mine but not like thine Lucretia  Triumphant glorious but detested base  And ignominious as the meanest slave's  The most contemptuous vilest malefactor's  VALERIUS  What do I see What hear Surely my senses  Are bassled by some vain illusion  And my eyes see not nor my ears draw in  What I suppose they see and hear    While  Brutus  is speaking  Lucretius  and  Collatinus  are divided sometimes looking with astonishment on  Brutus  sometimes with grief on  Lucretia  when he ceases the latter gets the mastery and they are wholly taken up with her  COLLATINE  Oh wife  Dear dearest half of me Gone gone for ever  LUCRETIUS  Child of my soul Supporter of my being  But soon my heart will burst and I shall be  Lock'd in the arms of death as thou art now  Staff of my age Lost lost for ever lost  BRUTUS  What are ye men There lies your bleeding child  There lies your tender wife will tears again  Her lifeless corse reanimate Will tears  Revenge her timeless death I now methinks  Behold the ruffian glorying in the deed  Telling the tale of shame to his lewd brothers  And riotous associates who agape  Listen with greedy ear and grin applause  To the rank act of lust while thus says he  I said thus did and thus and thus the wife  Of Collatinus and Lucretius' daughter  You choose to have your names garnish the tale  Of foul obscenity without a doubt  You like it well and to be bandied round  Mid bawdy revellers Think you to live  Thus branded with ignominy Go shew  Your bloodshot eyes and furrow'd cheeks to Tarquin  And beg him on your knees for that his son  Hath done this damned deed to spare your lives  Tell him you are meek men you bear no malice  Your hearts are form'd for injuries your weapons  Are shortdrawn sighs and briny flowing tears  He will believe you he is credulous  So are his sons an inoffensive race  And merciful witness that bleeding wound  Witness this reeking steel Is this a time  For tears for vain laments Now rouse up all  That is of manhood in us Swear with me  Swear all upon this dagger to revenge  This execrable deed unparallel'd  This deed at which the conscious night which saw it  Turn'd pale with horror at which nature shudders  Oh Jove Supreme And thou paternal Mars  And unpolluted Vesta hear again  My oath repeated To the death I swear  I will pursue the two prime regal monsters  And all their progeny Should they take wings  They shall not 'scape my vengeance Should they hide  In deepest caverns there I'll penetrate  And drag them forth nor rest till they are swept  From off the earth which groans beneath their wickedness  This from the bottom of my soul I swear  Deeds soon shall follow words Here take it swear  Lucretius  LUCRETIUS  Wonder and astonishment  Seize on  BRUTUS  Of that hereafter speak Now swear  LUCRETIUS  I swear  BRUTUS  Swear Collatine  COLLATINE  I swear  BRUTUS  Valerius  Swear  VALERIUS  I swear  BRUTUS  And now my friends the first I e'er could call so  Let me embrace you round Now after long  Long penance done I am again myself  I see you hardly yet believe your eyes  Wondering but scarce convicted in suspence  Though strong persuasion tell you all is real  Think my good friends that hitherto you saw  My shadow only and my mock resemblance  The mimic of myself and ape ridiculous  Never till now appear'd I as I am  Heretofore in my place to th' eyes of men  Hath an impostor a poor stupid wretch  Insensible to insult void of shame  Contemn'd by all though in his own opinion  Of great importance which but served to make  His folly more conspicuous to the eyes  Of men I say this brutish character  Hath in my place appear'd now is he vanish'd  And I roused up from that lethargic slumber  In which I lay for twenty years or more  Now take again my rank i'th' file of men  Call reason mine and boast me in the name  Of longlost lateassumed humanity  My soul feels double strength from this inertness  I burn for action for the glorious day  When freedom shall be ours when I may say  To the chaste manes of Lucretia  Now rest at peace ye are at full revenged  When I shall say Rejoice imperial Rome  For tyranny is extinct and oppression  No more shall rule you with an iron rod  Bear forth the body to the marketplace  Then shut the gates that none may from Collatia  Bear any news to the camp go you before  And tell the melancholy tale myself  Will follow after and discourse the people  Thence unto RomeAnd Oh you powers on high  Propitious prove and let your aid be nigh  Still prompt the generous thought keep firm my soul  That I may safely reach the purposed goal  That I may pull Ambition to the ground  And Liberty may pour her gifts around  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  A Street in  Rome  Enter two Citizens one of  Collatia  the other of  Rome  FIRST CITIZEN  I Told you how this melancholy sight  The history of the deed shewn in its true  And native colours by th' afflicted husband  And father with the artless eloquence  Of real grief how the discovery  Of Brutus and his speech affected us  Each braver youth stood quickly by their side  Array'd in arms burning with indignation  Pent in their breasts We left Collatia  And enter'd Rome a sight so new and strange  With the arm'd multitude first struck th' inhabitants  With fear and terror but when they beheld  The order of our march peaceful and solemn  They soon put off their fears and throng'd to gaze  Undress'd unornamented on her bier  Lay scarce yet cold Lucretia's chaste remains  Beauteous in death you might have ta'en her so  And placed her in a temple 'twould be sworn  'Twas Venus' image cut in alabaster  Or for her hair confusedly scatter'd over  Her comely face and neck Dian reclined  After her toil upon a mount exposed  To the rude winds while in her breast the wound  She gave herself would cause you to admire  What sacrilegious hand should dare to stab  And give a deity to death  SECOND CITIZEN  Where now  Is this procession And how far behind you  FIRST CITIZEN  They must by this have wellnigh reach'd the forum  Where Brutus who is tribune of the guards  A place of trust which Tarquin only gave him  As he appear'd an object of contempt  Hath call'd together all the centuries  He and Valerius are mean time to meet  The snators who are by this convened  The few whom Tarquin's sword hath left alive  To lay before them his intent his plans  And to be guided by their wise advice  While in the forum with Lucretia's corse  Laid forth to view the father and the husband  Relate the manner of her death when this  Is finish'd Brutus shall harangue the people  SECOND CITIZEN  Great matters as I think may rise from this  FIRST CITIZEN  The greatest that can rise the most desired  And least expected ever to have happened  If you at Rome equal in generous sentiments  Us at Collatia  SECOND CITIZEN  What they are I guess  And would myself with joy hazard my life  Was there a probability shewn to me  Of gaining what we now so long have lost  But rash adventurers seldom meet with profit  And a dead sleep of five and twenty years  Is what men can't be easily awaked from  But curiosity if nothing else  Will lead me to the forum  FIRST CITIZEN  I'll attend you  I came this nearer way to avoid the crowd  And glad I am I found you    Exeunt  SCENE II  The Forum at  Rome  Lucretius  and  Collatinus  standing by the Body of  Lucretia  The  Roman  People round them The Rostrum behind  LUCRETIUS  Thus thus my friends fast as our breaking hearts  Permitted utterance have we unfolded  This narrative of sad distress for us  What now remains robb'd as we are of all  Which gave a joy to life but to pursue  The example she hath set us to invoke  The timeless destinies and end our beings  With our own wretched handsOh vile oldage  Which for her sake alone I wish'd to see  Oh luckless youth whose sorrow equals mine  For thou alas hast lost an equal blessing  Merciless villain Dearest dearest daughter  Yet let us mix our sorrows let us drop  Our tears together on her lifeless clay  Nor will your tender hearts my countrymen  Forbear to sympathize with us and join  Your sigh of grief to ours  FIRST ROMAN  Oh piteous deed  SECOND ROMAN  Oh lamentable sight  THIRD ROMAN  Illfated husband  FOURTH ROMAN  Oh lamentable sight  THIRD ROMAN  Illfated husband  FOURTH ROMAN  Most wretched father  FIFTH ROMAN  Let us all attend  And pay due honour to Lucretia's corse  SIXTH ROMAN  Let all our matrons mourn and let our virgins  Strew roses on her bier  FIRST ROMAN  Come then away  And let us all prepare the funeral pile  LUCRETIUS  For this compassion  FIRST ROMAN  Silence all attend  LUCRETIUS  For this your tenderness my gentle friends  I thank you from my soul But know you not  The tribune of the guards hath call'd you hither  Hear Lucius Junius first you know not what  He hath to impart to you private affairs  Must yield to public until he hath finish'd  I will not suffer you bestow a thought  On me and mine unusual is this call  Your meetings long neglected Nay I'll tell you  For why from you should I hide any thing  It is for me and mine that he appears  For me for him for every Roman here  But lo he comes Make way my countrymen  And I beseech you list to what he utters  With deepest silence  FIRST ROMAN  Room there room make away  SECOND ROMAN  Let him ascend the rostrum  THIRD ROMAN  Surely this  Is errant madness hear a fool harangue  FOURTH ROMAN  Be patient fool or not is he not tribune  And don't the laws permit him to harangue  FIFTH ROMAN  Besides Lucretius hath desired our silence  SIXTH ROMAN  Hist he begins methinks his looks are alter'd  BRUTUS  Romans and friends you see before you now  No blundering ideot bearing to your ears  The mandates of a tyrant and disgracing  This rostrum with the servile repetition  By many who are present this assertion  May not be credited so warily  I've play'd th' imposture which necessity  Compell'd me to assume For when your king  King do I call him when the monster Tarquin  Slew as you most of you may well remember  And those who do not may have heard reported  My father Marcus and my elder brother  Envying their virtues and with covetous  And greedy eye desiring to possess  Their tempting wealth what treatment at that time  Could I have hoped for Where could I have found  Protection had I not put on the mask  Of unsuspected unrevenging folly  The mask which having to this day preserved me  This day of my discovery which I long  Have wish'd I now forever throw aside  FIRST ROMAN  Most wonderful  SECOND ROMAN  Who ever heard the like  THIRD ROMAN  I'm lost in admiration  FOURTH ROMAN  'Twas well thought on  He had no other way to save himself  I should myself have done the very same  FIFTH ROMAN  How we were all deceived  SIXTH ROMAN  Aye and the king  And his three sons who used to laugh at him  FOURTH ROMAN  Well I saw always something in his face  That look'd I thought like as if who should say  I am not what you take me for  FIRST ROMAN  Peace peace  He can't proceed silence he speaks again  BRUTUS  Would you know why I summon'd you together  Ask you what brings me here Behold this dagger  Clotted with gore Behold that frozen corse  See these unhappy men whose tale of woe  Of horrid woe you from their mouths have heard  And mingled social tears Oh chastity  Is this thy fate Oh Rome how wilt thou mourn  Thy thinn'd inhabitants if goodness virtue  Treated as crimes must meet the stroke of death  If youth and beauty must be fingled out  First prey'd on by rapacious lust then murder'd  Oh I could mourn thy fate Lucretia  Could like thy father and thy husband mourn  Could in laments vie with each Roman soul  Who now beholds thee and lament I will  I can't refrain my heart is wrung with grief  Unutterable inconceivable  FIRST ROMAN  Alas Lucretia  SECOND ROMAN  Poor unhappy matron  THIRD ROMAN  Why wert thou good and beautiful and young  FOURTH ROMAN  Her father and her husband are half dead  FIFTH ROMAN  Brutus methinks is moved as much they  FOURTH ROMAN  Brutus Why Brutus Didst not hear him say  He was no more an ideot  FIFTH ROMAN  True I heard it  But use is not so easily o'ercome  SIXTH ROMAN  Silence attend see he proceeds again  BRUTUS  Did I my countrymen say I could mourn  Lucretia's deathWhat sorrow must I feel  When I beheld before my eyes as now  Methinks I do each Roman matron dead  When I behold each Roman maid abus'd  For who shall circumscribe the range of lust  What numbers shall fill up his ravenous gorge  And bid his raging appetite be still  When I behold each Roman citizen  Who hath a muchlov'd wife a darling daughter  Doom'd like these two to death because with grief  Surcharg'd they do not sit in silence down  But dare proclaim their feelingsPublic murder  For such a crime shall snatch them from the world  Or they shall fall by the midnight assassin  Nor must their friends say how they met their death  But lay the blame upon their own despair  FIRST ROMAN  They shall not die  SECOND ROMAN  We will protect them both  THIRD ROMAN  We will defend them from the tyrant's wrath  BRUTUS  Defend them say you Miserable men  You know not what you say Protect them both  Can you protect yourselves You have committed  Treason against the tyrant and his brood  Of monster sons you've dared to look with pity  You've dropp'd a tear on murder'd innocence  You've seen Lucretia and have wept her fate  You're partners with her father and her husband  In guilty sorrow You have listen'd too  To me a wretch who twenty lingering years  Have for your sakes imposed upon the tyrant  And borne the grossest insults You have done  All this and do you not expect to feel  The weight of punishment which is your due  Are you not Tarquin's slaves for so he calls you  And don't you dread the whip Doth he not name you  The herd The beast with many heads And will not  The fury Massacre let loose among you  Revel kneedeep in blood  FIRST ROMAN  Instruct us Brutus  What we shall do  SECOND ROMAN  We'll follow thee in all things  THIRD ROMAN  Thou shalt direct us  FOURTH ROMAN  Give us thy commands  And we'll obey  FIFTH ROMAN  Instruct us Brutus  BRUTUS  Must you be taught then what to do Look there  Once more look that way She one night alone  Outrage and violence sustain'd not all  The entreaties of her friends her weeping father  Begging as he'd extort a gift from heaven  Not all her husband's tender supplication  Could shake her purpose with a fearful hand  But an undaunted soul a woman's feelings  But more than manly thought deep in her breast  She plung'd this sharpedged steel which set her free  Yes thou art free Lucretia thou art gone  Noblest of women where no Tarquins dwell  Lust gloats not on the dead nor cruelty  And bestial fierceness riot in the grave  Oh most illustrious of thy sex inspire  Our spiritwanting minds with but a portion  However small of thy bright excellence  Yet even that I fear would be in vain  We are inured too much to slavery  To dare resist we are quite reconciled  Determined still to drudge beneath the yoke  To shrink each hour at sight of some new murder  Some deed of baseness treachery and horror  Yet with our lips cry Hail allgracious Tarquin  To work in sewers all day shut up mid damps  Denied the sight of heaven's blessed sun  Yet in the eve when we halfchoak'd revisit  The upper air to praise benignant Tarquin  To see his sons rush into every house  To see our wives ravish'd before our eyes  To see each ripening tender maid deflower'd  To see them kill themselves to see their pale  And ashy corses in the public forum  Ranged all arowYet then we are determined  To bless kind Tarquin mercyloving Tarquin  And beg him to beget some dozen more  Of sturdy sons with such like acts of kindness  To bless his humble faithful citizens  If this were not your fix'd determination  Say would you seek instructions Would you ask  What you should do Ask ye yon conscious walls  Which saw his poison'd brother saw the incest  Committed there and they will cry Revenge  Ask ye yon conscious street where Tullia drove  O'er her dead father's corse 'twill cry Revenge  Ask yonder senate house whose stones are purple  With human blood and it will cry Revenge  Go to the tomb where lies his murder'd wife  And the poor queen who lov'd him as her son  Their unappeased ghosts will shriek Revenge  The temples of the gods th' allviewing heavens  The gods themselves shall justify the cry  And swell the general sound Revenge Revenge  ALL  Revenge Revenge Revenge  BRUTUS  And we will be reveng'd my countrymen  Brutus shall lead you on Brutus a name  Which will when you're reveng'd be dearer to him  Than all the splendent titles earth can boast  Nor I alone see where Valerius brings  The noblest of the city See where stand  Lucretius Collatine Nor age nor grief  Depress their spirits so as not to seek  Glorious revengeYou are this moment free  I see the tyrant fled his soul dies in him  The voice of liberty hath reach'd the camp  I see the gladful soldiers hasting home  Big to enjoy that freedom you possess  Each one clasps close his friend weeps on his neck  Unable to express the bursting pleasure  Stretching his heart But when you name revenge  His eyes flash living fire and he resolves  With you to hunt the monsters through the world  For tyranny once having found a foe  Meets not with an upholder Once again  Let me pronounce you free Again 'tis yours  To bring your votes and the first case before you  Is what becomes of Tarquin  ALL  We banish him the city we banish him the city  BRUTUS  And now what course will you yourselves pursue  ALL  Arms Brutus arms We'll march against the tyrant  Lead us against him  BRUTUS  If you'll by my advice be oversway'd  ALL  Give it us give it we will follow it  BRUTUS  Myself with some of the Patrician youth  Wellmounted will away unto the camp  Do you each man furnish'd with arms prepared  For action or advice immediately  Haste to the Campus Martius there Valerius  Shall with the senate to your ears impart  And to be ratified by your consent  That plan of government by me delineated  When in my fatuous state each thought was busied  For you and RomeGuard well the city gates  Pay the last duties to Lucretia's corse  And soon expect to see my safe return  And with me all your friends Th' immortal gods  Are your defence fear nothing but be bold  FIRST ROMAN  Oh noble Brutus  SECOND ROMAN  Giver of liberty  THIRD ROMAN  Father of Rome  FOURTH ROMAN  Deliverer of his country  FIFTH ROMAN  Our guardian god  SIXTH ROMAN  A temple shall be his  Next that of Romulus  BRUTUS  Oh my dear countrymen should I pretend  T' express the joy I feel for you the gratitude  You raise within me for this high applause  Shewn to my poor deserts the time we now  Possess were much too scant e'en years would fail  I'm wholly yours and long as I shall breathe  The breath of life will only live for you  Now I descend and will accompany you  Without the forum there we'll separate  You for your arms I to the camp at Ardea  The gods who long have in the book of Fate  Foreseen this time the gods who hate injustice  Who punish perfidy and cruel deeds  Go with us both their influence I obey  The humble instrument they have appointed  To rescue you from bondage to restore  Your ancient rites to give you days of peace  And liberty the attribute of man  But grant me one request tho' real joy  I know ill brooks restraint keep back this tumult  Of your applause your love I'd fain acquire  Heaven is my witness I would die t' acquire it  But clamour ever shews illguided counsels  The voice of rashness th' argument of numbers  Of reason destitute Not so the plan  Which we pursue the surest grounds are ours  Maturely founded and late brought to light  Let us accomplish then the end proposed  With prudent zeal with decent vigour firm  Intrepid hope and silent resolution    Exeunt  SCENE III  The Camp  Tarquin's  Tent  TARQUIN MESSENGER GUARDS  TARQUIN  Take this Collatian scarecrow guard him safe  If that the news thou bring'st shall be found false  Prepare thee for the tortures of the cross  MESSENGER  My Lord it is too true  TARQUIN  Away with him    Exeunt Messenger and guards  Brutus it cannot be The gods themselves  Could not bestow on him the use of reason  Brutus incite the people to sedition  As soon shall the Tarpeian rock turn vo  al  As soon the wooden Jove i'th' capitol  Hurl the Vulcanian bolt This knave hath heard  Some vague report when drunk or in his sleep  Hath dream'd of this account an unconnected  Improbable impossible adventure  Enter an Attendant  My Lord another hasty messenger  Begs your immediate hearing  TARQUIN  Bring him before us  MESSENGER  prostrating himself    Pardon most gracious Tarquin e'er I speak  TARQUIN  Speak boldly man for thou hast nought to fear  MESSENGER  I come dread sovereign from Rome where Brutus  Hath urged the people to rebellion  TARQUIN  How and which way  MESSENGER  My Lord this morn a herald  I'th' name o'th' captain of the guards convok'd  The general people to the public forum  Curious to know the cause I too went thither  Soon was brought forth the body of Lucretia  Attended by Lucretius and her husband  And a large body of Collatian youth  In arms by turns they spake unto the people  Oft interrupted were their words with sighs  And tears  TARQUIN  Proceed be brief  MESSENGER  They said Lucretia  By Sextus ravish'd had foredone herself  The people moved with pity heard the tale  And every eye was wet  TARQUIN  Thy tediousness  Is insupportable haste to the end  MESSENGER  Then Brutus came and mounting in the rostrum  First having shewn that his stupidity  Was only forged proceeded  TARQUIN  'Tis enough  No more Without Prepare with utmost speed  A band of chosen horse Where are my sons  Why stand you thus Where are my sons I say  What follow'd after he had spoke  MESSENGER  The people  All with one voice when he proposed the question  Of what becomes of Tarquin cried We banish him  TARQUIN  HowDared theyHah 'tis well What afterwards  MESSENGER  He then directed them first to take arms  And while he hasted hither to the camp  To meet Valerius and the senators  I'th' Campus Martius who would lay before them  A scheme of government This having heard  I hurried straight away  TARQUIN  Thy loyalty  Shall meet with its reward for themWho waits  Where are my sons Quick bid those horsemen mount  And wait for my commands Deep hypocrite  Beyond exampleOh I see through all  But short shall be his reign mysterious dark  Unfathomable villain But his life  His forfeit lifeand the quick easywrought  Inconstant crowd them I'll reduce much lower  Than beasts of burthen they have lived too fat  Kick they their master thusWhy did I leave  One senator alive I had done well  T' have extirpated all both root and branch  Had done  is pass'd the present hour is mine  And that shall be well used On danger's verge  To act unmoved recoil into himself  See every train of possible design  And judge the best is the great character  Of the superior soul This is the time  Of trial Tarquin this the grand event  To stamp thee fortuneproof This enemy  The tenor of his life his perseverance  Marks the most dangerous thence the most worthy  Thou ever hadst to cope withal But he  If he hath gain'd not every mortal engine  To aid his purpose draws upon his head  Sure ruinTo leave Rome and seek the camp  He falls in his own snare  Enter  ARUNS  and  TITUS  My sons you come  In wish'dfor time you know these accidents  TITUS  We heard them with amazement  TARQUIN  Where is Sextus  The ravisher of matrons who inspires  Idiots with sense and raises insurrections  Against his father  ARUNS  We in vain enquired  He was not in his tent  TARQUIN  Well may he fear  To meet my presence by th' immortal gods  This hand should slay him for a fool a dolt  A common thief would ere he robb'd a house  First kill the mastiff at the gate who else  Might worry him returning As this tale  By busy rumour to the soldiers' ears  May get access and if it doth his presence  May be with fatal consequence attended  Bid him still hide himself or to withdraw  Entirely from the camp Myself will hence  And with these lightarm'd horsemen intercept  This Brutus on the road which being done  I doubt not but to get speedy admittance  Into the city where th' unruly mob  Distract with fear and multitude of counsels  Will of themselves be ready for submission  Should he escape my hands in every avenue  Place trusty guards and give strict orders to them  To slay him ere he reach the camp  TITUS  We shall not  Be wanting on our part  TARQUIN  Alas my sons  ARUNS  What ails my father  TARQUIN  I am well again  A sudden damp and creeping horror seiz'd me  'Tis over now I thought my throne fix'd firm  As th' everlasting basis of the earth  Fool that I was to trust to quibbling gods  When to the Delphic fane you took your way  What said the dark expounder who perplexes  In double maze what she pretends t'unfold  These were the words o'th' Pythian sorceress  "Beasts shall enjoy the reason of mankind  "E'er Tarquin from the snake disturbance find"  This is the beast this is the fated snake  Whom you and I have cherish'd in our bosoms  And now he brandishes his forked sting  And casts his baneful mortal venom round  Threatening destruction But avaunt vain fears  I have been scared by omens but the wretch  Who yields to superstition well deserves  To fall its sacrifice I'll haste away  Cowards and fools misfortunes antedate  In his own hand the brave man holds his fate    Exeunt  SCENE IV  Sextus  's Tent  ARUNS SEXTUS TITUS  ARUNS  I do not blame the deed the simple deed  Oh you mistake me quite the deed might stand  Inroll'd I'll read it rape nothing but rape  Plain rape I'd turn my eyes another way  Nor add one transient slight remark of mine  To those of conscientious babbling sniveling  Mouthwatering knaves who envy every man  The dainty morsel they can't eat themselves  But I see wrote in equal characters  Bad consequences such as these to wit  Revenge and mutiny and insurrection  And banishment and loss of empire these  Denominate the deed with me and these  I still will harrass and perplex thee with  And ring thee such alarms that thou shalt wish  The cutthroat Brutus or the cuckold Collatine  Stood by thee rather with their sharpen'd swords  Levell'd against thy throat  SEXTUS  Pr'ythee no more  I don't repent the deed as for the consequences  Thy words can't add a sting to my reflections  ARUNS  Yet I will sting thee I will taunt thee still  No rather let me like a loving brother  Turn thy apologist and make excuses  As thus When lust revels predominant  Folly and frenzy cut wild capriols  In Reason's court Or thus with languid eye  And whining toneWhen beauty fires the sense  Beauty soft tyrant amiable invader  Consideration turns an hoodwink'd ass  Or thus in grave and philosophic vein  What mortal man can with his finite glance  Survey the boundless waste of future time  And cull out the events which there are sown  Crude unexistent till th' allpotent hand  Of Jove uplifts them from the dark abyss  And gives them form substantialOh man man  What a vile fool art thou By heaven and earth  The stalking monster man grows every day  More and more stupid and ridiculous  See the erect machine he lifts his head  Proclaims himself a godling Bend ye abject  Inferior animalsOh could I set thee  Proud miscreant in thy place there's not a beast  But I would raise above thee Reason thine  The matchless gift of speech An ox an ape  Could I interpret talks as well as thou dost  His actions prove itNot foresee events  With all thy reason Instinct then is better  Which of the herd will plunge into the tide  Expect the liquid element to change  And bear him as on land Did e'er the eagle  Forth from his lofty ayerie dart to th' ground  And not expand his wings E'er he enjoys  His loving mistress the stern bull knows well  That he must beat his rival from the pasture  But why thus throw away my time on trifles  The most insipid theme that man can talk of  Is of mankind Titus see there behold  He too will boast his reason yet he knows not  The veriest insect will when trod upon  Endeavour at resistance  TITUS  To what purpose  This tends I can't conceive Oh Aruns Aruns  E'er we set up for masters it were well  Did we ourselves still practise what we teach  ARUNS  Thou with thy musty rulesPatience herself  At opening of thy mouth would stop her ears  Or run away fast as her heels could bear her  Pour in thy potions Titus his hot blood  Wants cooling medicines sedative morality  Sextus attend thy fever shall abate  And thou shalt fall into a leaden slumber  And so I leave you both either to other  Wise leach may Phoebus aid thee at thy need  So shall thy patient's health be sound as thine    Exit  SEXTUS  Adieu dissatisfied and chiding humorist  TITUS  Did I not tell thee what I fear'd would follow  SEXTUS  I pr'ythee do not thou reproach me too  Rather advise me in this hour of danger  How I had best dispose myself to leave  The camp would argue fear would argue shame  Nor would I mid the rabble so exalt  Their selfconceit to think I aught could do  To make me in their presence hang my head  For one or t'other cause Besides I doubt not  But that our father's everready mind  Which like the sierce tide 'gainst the rushing tempest  Still rises stronger meeting opposition  Will prompt him with the means of wish'd success  That he will gain admittance into Rome  I little question and should Brutus turn  A different way toward the camp those bands  Which with strict orders watch each avenue  Will render us as good account of him    A Shout  What sound is that Methought it was a shout  As of a multitude  TITUS  It was perhaps the guards  Have taken Brutus prisoner or slain him  Enter  CLAUDIUS  CLAUDIUS  Fly fly my Lords Brutus is in the camp  I saw him with these eyes he waves aloft  The bloody dagger all the soldiers hear him  With wildest admiration and applause  He speaks as if he held the souls of men  In his own hand and moulded them at pleasure  They look on him as they would view a god  Who from a darkness which invested him  Springs forth and knitting his stern brow in frowns  Proclaims the vengeful doom of angry Jove  Herminius and Horatius too have join'd him  All cry aloud Revenge Revenge on Tarquin  Death to his sonsFly fly and save yourselves  TITUS  Herminius and Horatius TraitorsHow  Pass'd he the guards  CLAUDIUS  They brought him in triumphant  TITUS  Where's Aruns  CLAUDIUS  He is fled my Lord to Caere  And bids you follow him with utmost haste  TITUS  Whither wilt thou  SEXTUS  I shall straitway to Gabii  As to a safe asylum Fare thee well  TITUS  Farewel to SextusOh pernicious fortune  From this day forth I date the utter ruin  Of Tarquin and his sons    Exeunt  SCENE V  The Walls of  Rome  TARQUIN  at the Gate above  LUCRETIUS COLLATINUS VALERIUS  and  Roman  People  LUCRETIUS  Whate'er he says to you ye gentle Romans  Let me intreat you answer not a word  Who's he that asks admittance  TARQUIN  Am I then  Alter'd so much of late that old Lucretius  Knows not his king Why are these gates fast barr'd  And who is it that dares refuse me entrance  LUCRETIUS  This shall I answer strait As for my king  I know thee not tho' Tarquin well I know  And know him for a tyrant who long time  Many a dreadful year of servitude  Held Rome inslaved against that cruel tyrant  These gates are barr'd those who refuse him entrance  Are all the Roman people who have dared  Proclaim him banish'd from their land for ever  TARQUIN  Is this thy gratitude old man From me  Thou hadst th' authority thou now usurp'st  The government of Rome  LUCRETIUS  When thou wert king  I held from thee the government I own it  Thou from the people then didst hold thy crown  Who've since deposed thee from the people now  I hold the interregal dignity  When Brutus from the camp shall with him bring  Th' enfranchis'd army if to him and Collatine  As they've determin'd they deliver up  The delegated trust their future consuls  I shall with readiness and pleasure yield  Into their hands my transitory sway  TARQUIN  Had any others in the Roman state  Fomented mid the people this rebellion  I should not thus have wonder'd but that you  You three whom I've admitted to my councils  Loaded with honours dignities and gifts  Of price that you should with th' ingrateful Brutus  Whom as my child I've foster'd join to ruin  Your gracious master and kind benefactor  Is one of those strange accidents I labour  In vain to reconcile to probability  LUCRETIUS  For all the various favours I've received  From Tarquin and his race I am most grateful  But chiefly grateful for my murder'd daughter  COLLATINE  I for my ravish'd and selfslaughter'd wife  VALERIUS  I in the name of all the Roman people  Confess my gratitude the many favours  On them bestow'd now for these many a year  My greatest happiness have constituted  For Brutus who is absent let me thank thee  Both for his murder'd father and his brother  TARQUIN  Oh Collatine Lucretius all the powers  Who rule this universe can witness for me  How I detest that hateful deed none feels  More for the injured father and the husband  None curses more the impious perpetrator  Though from these loins he sprang than I myself  No let the criminal bear all the weight  Of your just vengeance let him be brought forth  Before the Roman people stand his trial  As by my royal word I swear he shall  Were he three times my son and is his death  Decreed he surely dies But must the innocent  Be with the guilty punish'd Must the father  Bear the son's crimes the crimes which he abhors  Yes when I heard the tale Lucretius  I started back with horror while my heart  Wept tears of blood  LUCRETIUS  Such tears thou shedd'st over thy poison'd brother  COLLATINE  Such o'er thy wife brought to her timeless end  VALERIUS  Such tears thou shedd'st over thy good old king  LUCRETIUS  Such over each assassinated noble  COLLATINE  Such over every murder'd Roman knight  VALERIUS  Such over every deathdoom'd citizen  TARQUIN  How much you wrong my nature you yourselves  Shall be the living judges Prove my mercy  Return to your allegiance reconcile  To my authority the ductile croud  By you seduced do this and here I swear  In presence of the gods by every tie  Which binds mankind my eyes shall overlook  All that is pass'd nay more I will submit me  To your advice in all things nor shall ought  That you can ask not be by me perform'd  LUCRETIUS  Canst thou restore my daughter to my arms  COLLATINE  Canst thou call forth my wife from her dark tomb  VALERIUS  Canst thou bring back to life ten thousand Romans  By thy ambition slain or cruelty  TARQUIN  Oh Romans Oh my countrymen to you  Do I appeal from these injurious men  Lo here I stand helpless and destitute  Imploring pity only where I ought  To claim obedience prayers are th' arms I use  Does this bespeak a tyrantSee these locks  Grey with the cares of government these rather  Bespeak the father I have govern'd you  For five and twenty years during which time  I've fought your battles 'gainst your enemies  From whom you have return'd with honour crown'd  Loaded with spoils I'm cover'd o'er with scars  For you received for ill doth he deserve  The name of royalty who braves not peril  Who shrinks affrighted at the frown of death  Yet tells his subjects he's not terrible  And bids them meet the fury face to face  For you and for your glory hath my life  Been still employ'd I'm wearied out with toil  Endured for you To raise your name abroad  And make each kingdom round you mention Rome  And what belongs to Rome with aweAll this  I've done for you For you have borne the frost  Of keen December and for you sustain'd  The torrid dogstar Have I ever hoarded  My share o'th' plunder Fill'd my treasury  With stuff which I despised but as it served  To add to Rome new lustreLook behind you  Are not for you these sumptuous buildings rais'd  And for your honour Let the gods themselves  Declare my motives who now dwell in temples  Fitting their dignity and Rome's magnificence  For which of these my works am I exiled  Oh you have been deceived grossly deceived  If I'm accus'd of any fancied crimes  Artfully lodged against me till the time  You bid me reign I shall as it behoves me  Lay by my crown Admit me then unarm'd  Thus as a suppliant with his naked head  Admit your king he begs at your tribunal  To plead his cause he asks but common justice  But to be heard before he is condemn'd  LUCRETIUS  Who can refrain from laughter at this sight  Tarquin the most unjust of mortal men  Requiring justice Tarquin who ne'er heeded  A suppliant's prayers or in his wrath remember'd  Sweet mercy asking pity of a people  Whom he hath ever harrass'd with oppression  Their glory didst thou seek No 'twas thy own  Proud man Hadst thou thy people's glory sought  Or hadst thou truly known wherein thy own  Consisted thou would'st have desired to see them  Happy and free What glory e'er did slaves  Receive from conquest Or what happiness  Can slaves enjoy seeing a splendid palace  Or gorgeous templeWhile within the heart  Freedom sits not inthron'd and in that shrine  Where heaven's pure flame should dwell lurks discontent  And struggling though depress'd the generous ardor  They from their ancestors inherited  What Roman is alive to any thought  But one the secret wish of righteous vengeance  Retire false wretch odious to gods and men  Retire e'er 'tis too late lest now provok'd  We ope our gates indeed and rushing on thee  Thy sentence change from banishment to death  Enter  CLAUDIUS  to  TARQUIN  CLAUDIUS  I come sent by the princess  TARQUIN  In thy face  I read thy news draw nearer and disclose it  But whisper low that none may overhear thee  CLAUDIUS  The guards instead of seizing Brutus brought him  Into the camp he gain'd the soldiers there  As he before had gain'd the citizens  Titus and Aruns are to Caere fled  Sextus to Gabii Brutus is at hand  With all the cavalry if you delay  My gracious lord a moment you are lost  TARQUIN  Ye factious demagogues and stubborn people  Once more attend your king This messenger  Brings me advice the army is at hand  To aid their master Brutus the archrebel  Is by their loyal ardor done to death  Now then prepare to feel the utmost weight  Of my avengement if I enter in  In all my terror by th' immortal gods  I will have no remorse I'll shew no pity  I'll decimate the rebel crew your limbs  Shall feed the foxes and each bird obscene  Unburied scatter'd o'er the bloodstain'd earth  What do ye trembleYet deluded people  If e'er the army come you ope your gates  Throw down your wearpons ask my clemency  You shall as little as you have deserv'd it  Or may expect such clemency from me  All meet with mercy and a gracious pardon  Nay and at your request I'll spare your leaders  Provided they exile themselves from Rome  VALERIUS  Tyrant thou speak'st in vain thy artifice  Is shallow and pierced through I saw pale fear  Sit on the chalk'd face of thy messenger  The army can't degenerate so far  From those brave men whom they have left behind  They are not from thy native place Tarquinii  But Romans born and will with joy receive  Him who proclaims them freeBut should he perish  Should Brutus which avert ye righteous powers  Have fail'd in his great enterprize and met  A glorious death glorious in such a cause  And hallow'd though by th' hands of villains slain  Of regal fools know Tarquin there are still  Enough t' assume the part which he began  Not one but fifty Brutus's are here  Who will in the defence of liberty  Resist thy power till the last drop shall leave  Their noble hearts we are resolved while life  Is ours to live like men if die we must  As soon or late all shall like men to die    Shout at a distance  LUCRETIUS  Hear tyrant hear this is the sound of fate  Which peals forth thy destruction 'tis the shout  Of liberty the signal of success  Brutus returns in triumph let us all  Prepare in worthy manner to receive  Our great deliverer This is the hour  By destiny decreed to teach mankind  But chiefly guilty kings that there are gods  Who care for mortal deeds and rule with justice  The realms of heaven above and earth below    Exeunt  TARQUIN  Ye furies glut yourselves if there are gods  Who bend so much from their prerogative  To league with rebel subjects 'gainst their kings  Make sure your work strike here blast me at once  Use me as I would use the Roman people  Were they all as one worm beneath my feet  Thus would I trample them and thusI leave thee  Hightowering city keep thy bulwarks firm  With double strength cement thy stones together  For if I err not I'll raise such a flame  Throughout Hetruria as shall not be quench'd  Till thou and all thy sons be burnt as stubble  Fired with one general blaze should to their aid  Their traitors' guardian gods descend I'll bear  The hurrying storm along the troubled air  By vengeance rais'd impell'd by brave despair    Exit  SCENE VI  Rome  BRUTUS  and  COLLATINUS  as Consuls with Lictors  VALERIUS LUCRETIUS  and others  BRUTUS  Indeed my noble friends you judge me rightly  These honours little move the mind of Brutus  Ne'er did I covet gewgaws or the farce  Of windblown pomp 'Tis not the purple robe  The curule chair the lictors' keenedg'd ax  Inforcing homage which e'er drew one thought  Of mine aside But to behold a state  Deliver'd from oppression to expel  Base ignominious slavery with those  Who forg'd her chains for a free people's neck  To see that people bless'd with liberty  And think that we shall hand down to our children  The most invaluable gift of heaven  'Twas this expectancy alone which cast  A light through that black shade in which I dwelt  And now this having seen could I enjoy  Th' assurance of its being still continued  Again without a scruple I'd retreat  To my obscurity known to myself  Alone hail'd by no tongue seen by no eye  VALERIUS  That may not be yet in her infancy  Her joints quite slack unable to perform  Their motions and proceed alone Rome wants  Thy thinking head thy executive hand  And father's careI will not say my joy  Superior is to thine but sure 'tis equal  At least the force of it can't strain a point  Beyond its present stretch Lucretius too  And Collatine may now feel comfort calm  As a mild evening when the sun looks forth  Placidly shining after the fierce storms  Which overwhelm'd the day  LUCRETIUS  We do we do  COLLATINE  Such fellowfeeling with my noble colleague  Methinks my spirit hath that I almost  To see this hour could venture to pass through  Those agonies which tore my soul in twain  Enter a Messenger  MESSENGER  All health to Rome her senate and her consuls  BRUTUS  Speak on what thou hast farther to impart  MESSENGER  I hither come sent by th' inhabitants  Of Gabii they desire to mix with you  Their share of pleasure for your late success  And pray the gods you daily may increase  In every earthly blessing They intreat  You'll still esteem them as your firm allies  And ancient friends Chiefly they hail the man  Who first conceived and dared with brave resolve  Reduce to action what his mind inspired  Lastly I bring advice of Sextus' death  Who came no sooner to the gates of Gabii  Without his usual train attending him  Than mindful of their injuries sustain'd  Resenting his most cruel deeds to which  They had been long unwilling witnesses  The populace surrounding him with clubs  And stones the weapons which first came to hand  Slew the unpitied homicide  BRUTUS  This message  Thou must deliver to th' assembled fathers  From them receive thy answer Now Lucretia  Thy ghost may cease to wander o'er the earth  And rest in peace  LUCRETIUS  Blessed inhabitants  Of Gabii Oh ye gods your ways are just  Now will I sit me down and try to bear  Hateful old age th' affliction of mortality  But hastening on its remedy and cure  COLLATINE  Yet I regret the villain should be slain  By any hand but mine  Enter  CLAUDIUS  CLAUDIUS  Is Brutus here  My business is with him  BRUTUS  Another messenger  I know thee well disclose thy errand strait  CLAUDIUS  I come from Aruns what he bade me utter  If liberty of speech be granted me  I shall deliver  BRUTUS  Speak thy words are free  CLAUDIUS  Then thus he says tell Brutus tell that traitor  That fool who was that knave who ever will be  That should I meet him in the field of battle  Were his skull trebly thicker than it is  I'd thoroughly examine its contents  Is this denied me When I bear the sway  With Titus which perhaps he may remember  We earn'd together I will send to Delphi  On purpose for that cudgel he presented  Unto the God with which each day his shoulders  Shall be so flay'd that he shall wish his feign'd  Were turn'd to real insensibility  Treated with this correction during life  Ask him too if his bravery wars with women  And whether he hath slain the aged queen  BRUTUS  And dost thou bring no other message  CLAUDIUS  None  BRUTUS  'Tis worthy of the sender and the sent  Go tell thy pleasant master that I bear  Jointly with Collatine chief sway in Rome  Tell him the oracle is now fulfill'd  Tell him I kiss'd my mother when I fell  E'en in the very portico o'th' temple  The earth the general parent of us all  And if 'twill farther please him that the cudgel  I to the god presented was an emblem  Expressive of myself a golden rod  Beneath a case of wood As to his threats  Tell him I heed them as the chiding gale  Or th' ocean wave beating at the fix'd base  Of a high promontory Though should I meet him  Mid the ensanguin'd field in glorious fight  Engag'd for the great cause of liberty  I'll dare the proudest of my country's foes  And with the sword of vengeance on his crest  Engrave a mark indelible tell him  No Roman murders women that we leave  To Tarquin and his sons even the croud  Pursued her only through the streets with curses  Invok'd the furies of her parents on her  And saw her pass the city gate so hence  In safety go to him who sent thee hither    Exit  Claudius  VALERIUS  That missionary did but ill deserve  So civil a discharge  BRUTUS  Were Aruns us  Neither would he have found it Now my friends  Tomorrow will Horatius and Herminius  The Ardeates having to a truce agreed  For fifteen years lead all the army homeward  Then in the common meeting of the people  Lest they should think two kings instead of one  Though chosen annually may lord it o'er them  One of us Collatine will lay aside  Our symbols of command only resumed  Alternate month by month The good Papirius  King of the holy things shall offer up  Our general sacrifice while we again  And every individual then assembled  Both for ourselves and our posterity  Renew our solemn oath ne'er to admit  One of the Tarquin race This night more grateful  Than cloudsof inconse let our secret prayers  Our private gratitude and thanks ascend  To the highruling powers For howsoe'er  Vain man may think he plans with arduous care  'Tis they alone his sentiments inspire  They fill his breast with more than mortal fire  'Tis they alone light up the patriot flame  They lift the humble and the haughty tame  They every human accident foresee  To them not accident but certainty  FINIS
