you really have been three weeks without seeing Miss Bloomer  Sedl  True I assure you Woodford and intend if my resolution holds never to see her again  Woodf  But I understood every thing was settled between you both and that nothing remain'd but to name the happy day  Sedl  Prithee Woodford no moreIt adds to my uneasiness to hear her mention'd  Woodf  Why so  Sedl  Because I find this too susceptible heart of mine cannot so readily erase the impressions her youth beauty and innocence have made upon it  Woodf  Indeed But what reason can you have for wishing it  Sedl  The greatest in the world Woodford  Woodf  I cannot think soexplain or I shall certainly imagine you whimsical and capricious  Sedl  When I first paid my addresses to Miss Bloomer such were the beauties of her mind as well  as person that I fancied I had found one all perfect as the first before she fell  Woodf  Then were you in an Adamitical paradise  Sedl  A fool's one rathershe received me with such a flattering distinction that I thought myself the happiest of mortals when unluckily her guardian's dying put her into the immediate possession of a large fortune  Woodf  Now I should have thought that the luckiest circumstance that cou'd have happen'd  Sedl  Quite the contrarythus freed from restraint at the age of eighteen she emerged into all the fashionable follies of the great world without a real friend to advise or direct her  Woodf  Why did not you undertake that office  Sedl  I did but soon found it was an ungrateful oneso fine a girl independent of interested motives cou'd not fail of attracting a crowd of admirers and  Woodf  You naturally grew jealous  Sedl  Jealous My heart was torn in pieces'Twas then I discover'd a levity of temper a thoughtlessness a love of pleasure that destroy'd my hopes  Woodf  Psha triflesFoibles like these are as specks upon the sun  Sedl  Ay but in time they threaten a total eclipseNo character however contemptible but was encouraged as a loverNo scene of gaiety however censurable but was pursued with avidityA thousand instances did I patiently bear with in hopes of amendmentOft in the gentlest terms did I convey advice and represent the hazards she ran as oft was I forbad her presence  Woodf  Ha ha ha upon my word you took an excellent method of rendering yourself agreeable to a girl of her age and spirit  Sedl  But when I intended that girl as a partner for life cou'd you blame my cautious conduct No  Woodford though never man was more sensible of beauty's charms than I yet unless those charms are adorned with virtue they make not half the impression  Woodf  That's a little romantic but pray go on  Sedl  Many times did I rescue her from the most imminent dangers which her indiscretions plunged her into yet still she perseveredAt length  Woodf  Hold who comes here  Sedl  Oh 'tis Monsieur Finesseone of my rivalsa fellow whose impudence can only be equall'd by his ignorance  Enter  FINESSE  Fin  Ah gentlementVotre tres humble serviteurI be most glad to see you bothMonsieur Sedley I beg a to speak von word or two wid you  Sedl  Any thing particular Finesse  Fin  Oh oui ver particularfor your own ear  Sedl  You may speak out before Woodford I have just been acquainting him with the whole affair  Fin  Qu' avez vous fairMa foy dat be wrong doneYou shou'd say noting to hurt de fine Lady's reputation  Sedl  He is my particular friend and I can answer for his discretion  Fin  Parbleu particular friend sometime do de mosht mischief  Woodf  That will not be the case with me I promise you  Sedl  Come what news of Miss Bloomer  Fin  Ah pauvre Lady she had de grand escape yesterday  Sedl  Escape how  Fin  Why she be taking de innocent diversion at Vauxhall wid de bon companie as she suppose and engage in de partie wid tree gentlemen and deux ladie to be entertain in a boat on de Thames  Sedl  In a boat on the ThamesWellGo on  Fin  Dey be all stranger to her but vat of dat She not tink any harmSo dey row row along have de musique sing de petite chanson and be all so merry and gay till dey land at de Cousin as dey call her but begar she beVat you call Fille de joie  Sedl  Woman of the town  Fin  Ouishe be woman of de townden Miss Bloomer find her mistake and vant to return home againDey say no no and grow hardisat last when she be almost excedée etrois gentlemen by accident hear her cries and tout à fait rescue her  Sedl  Wou'd I had been thereVillains  Fin  Oh ouiVillains indeed  Sedl  You see Woodford there's another instance of her conductDo you think it possible for me to be happy with such a woman  Woodf  I tell you man you are too delicateTho' appearances are against her yet I dare affirm that these are all mistakes of the heart which in time her better judgment will rectify  Fin  True dey be all in de heartall vivacité noting elseI must find some oder opportunity when I shall have him to himself  aside  Well Monsieur Sedley I vill bid you de good mornI am going to visit de Lady I shall hear someting more dere and den I vill call on you at home in privateGentlemen sans compliment I have de honneur to be your very humble servant  Exit  Woodf  Hearky' Sedley do you build anything upon this fellow's intelligenceA wretch that's an outcast and disgrace to his nation  Sedl  Yet this very outcast as he really is does she treat in the most encouraging manner and without the least enquiry into his fortune or character admit amongst the number of her admirersBut let us change the subjectSo then it seems your Uncle has civilly dismiss'd you his house  Woodf  Not so civilly I assure you  Sedl  Don't you think you deserved it Captain Helm you know has spent the greater part of his life in ploughing the tempestuous ocean and tho' possest of an excellent heart has not the least idea of the refined sentiments inspired by a liberal educationYou were certain that your whole dependance was upon him yet refus'd flattering the harmless foibles which peculiarly mark his character  Woodf  You mistake me Sedley I often did till this last affairBut when he commenc'd my rival my happiness was too much concern'd to trifle any longer  Sedl  Well and has he declar'd his passion  Woodf  No but as a preparatory step he has given Lady Younglove who is just return'd to town with her daughter to understand that for the future she must not encourage my pretensions as I have nothing to expect from him  Sedl  So your hopes are all over in that quarter  Woodf  Entirely I called yesterday to welcome my dear girl my beauteous Flora to London and was refused admittance  Sedl  Indeed  Woodf  True and I am now reduced to such distress that unless you can assist me with your advice and  Sedl  Here's my handDepend upon my utmost I feel too much myself tho' from a different cause not to compassionate you  Woodf  I expected no less from your generous friendship but how shall we actWhat can I do  Sedl  Upon my word I don't knowI own yours is a critical caseBut we must not despairI believe as matters stand we had best work by stratagem Luckily I stand high in the estimation of your Uncle as well as Lady Younglove  Woodf  You'll find him inexorable and her  Sedl  Not proof against flatteryall mankind have their weak side Woodford and much may be done by taking a proper advantage of their follies  Woodf  I wish you may not be mistaken in the present case  Sedl  Never fearLet me see  Panses  No that won't doStay I believe I have itSuppose I attack Lady Younglove myself and persuade her that I am dying for love of her  Woodf  No no that's impossible'twould be too ridiculous  Sedl  Ha ha ha I'll lay my life there's nothing easierAttack Widows by storm and they can't resist youBesides her time grows short and as she was in such a violent hurry to get a second husband there's all the reason in the world to imagine her still more impatient for a third  Woodf  But what end do you propose by this scheme  Sedl  To serve you but in what manner I have not yet determinedCome let's home to my house and consider fartherNay nay no excusesI see you are unfit to be left to yourselfAnd the heart which does not feel the distress of a friend is not worthy of existence  Exeunt  SCENE Miss BLOOMER'S  Enter  FONTANGE  and  FINESSE  Font  Ha haAnd so Monsieur Sedley believe all de Mensonge all de story you tell him of my

Fashion  Miss Bloom  This intelligence has given me new spiritsI protest I began to be apprehensive that my charms were on the fadeA whole week passed and not one new admirer  Enter Miss  BELGROVE  Miss Bloom  My dear Belgrove you are come most opportunelyDo you know that since I saw you last I have made a fresh conquest  Miss Belg  I don't find any thing so surprizing in that  Miss Bloom  Why no that's true but I have now rose a step higher and captivated a Lord  Miss Belg  Lord or commoner I suppose he'll share the same fate with the rest  Miss Bloom  Certainly my dear you would not have me be unjust  Miss Belg  No really I would not therefore entirely disapprove of your making such fools of them  Miss Bloom  You mistake child the generality of them were fools ready made to my hand  Miss Belg  Some of them might be so but I don't find you are in the least more favourable to men of sense  Miss Bloom  Oh I hate your sensible men and take a particular pleasure in tormenting them  Miss Belg  That's very extraordinaryBut why so  Miss Bloom  Because it adds more to my reputation to lead in chains one of those wise Lords of the creation who has sense enough to know I use him ill yet not power sufficient to break his fetters than a thousand of those mincing whiffling trifling goodfornothing pretty Master Jessamys  Miss Belg  Well tho' I shall never approve of your scheme I almost wish for your spirits  Miss Bloom  Spirits my dearLord what should put me out of spiritsTime enough for me to pine and languish when the Heyday of my charms are overMine I'm afraid will be but a short reign so am determin'd to make the most of it  Miss Belg  Then I find you do intend to marry  Miss Bloom  Yes yes some time or other It wou'd mortify me prodigiously to die an old maidNo no I assure you I have not the least ambition to lead apes no more than I have at present to be led by one myselfI wou'd only play with the male creatures as a skilful angler does with his fishAmuse myself the sportive summer's day bait my hook well for gudgeons see the pretty innocents nibble nibble nibble as fast as I could cast inDraw them out when I pleasedStroke the delicate things and then throw them in againtill evening sun having disagreeably lengthen'd my shadow pick out the hero of the stream and retire to my rustic cottage content with the pleasures of the day  Miss Belg  But pray in the midst of this round of amusements do you never feel a pang for the loss of Sedley  Miss Bloom  If I really thought I had lost him for ever I should be heartily mortified  Miss Belg  Don't you think it begins to look like it  Miss Bloom  Why I am a little alarmedfor to confess the truth sincerely which in those cases I very seldom doOf all the men that ever address'd me he is the only one who has made an imprestion on my heart  Miss Belg  Why did not you use him better  Miss Bloom  'Tis not in my nature to be serious long together therefore why should he expect it  Miss Belg  Consider the many obligations you are under to himThe many dangers he rescued you from which your innocent levity exposed you to  Miss Bloom  That's true but then he should not have taken so ungenerous an advantage of them as to tell me that I did wrong and prescribe rules for my future conduct  Miss Belg  Were not those rules for your good  Miss Bloom  Yes but we are not always dispos'd to relish advice  Miss Belg  I really think if you lose him you'll never meet with such another  Miss Bloom  If I am disappointed of him I shall never have any other that's past a doubtAnd as a proof were he now to return I would frankly own that though I am innocent even in intention of acting wrong yet my thoughtlessness many times leads me into great errors which nothing but the sincerity of my heart can excuse  Miss Belg  'Tis great pity you did not make this declaration before  Miss Bloom  Psha he must take me as he finds meCan he be so unconscionable as to expect that I should draw up my head hold down my eyes put my hands together drop him a low curtesy and sayI have been a naughty girl to be sure but pray forgive me this time and indeed and double deed I'll do so no more  Miss Belg  No but he might reasonably expect that you'd dismiss your numerous train of followers  and as you have often sacrificed men of worth at the shrine of folly so in return to make a general oblationOffer up a hecatomb of fools at the altar of discretion  Miss Bloom  Do I bid the creatures follow me  Miss Belg  Nor don't you encourage them when they do  Miss Bloom  Ay that is because I hate illnature  Miss Belg  But are not you afraid your reputation should suffer  Miss Bloom  Oh my dear not in the leastEvery thing we do becomes usOur very frailties are pleasing  Miss Belg  Consider the  Miss Bloom  Positively I won't consider about the matterSo come along and always remember these neverfailing lines  If to her share some female errors fall  Look on her face and you'll forget them all  End of the First Act

Helm  Avast avast tack about and pay away no more of that cableMy nephew d'ye see is a lazy landlubberIf he had taken my advice I would have made a man of him and taught him to hand reef and steer with e'er a seaman in the navy  Sedley  These are accomplishments Captain not suitable to every man's taste and genius  Helm  Then their taste is not worth a rope's endI myself tho' a younger brother made my own fortune while his father was squandering away hisI was twice round the globe before I was fortyIn every birth from cabbinboy up to Captain of the TerribleAnd now having sufficient to lie by I am resolved to enjoy it and ride in a smooth harbour all the rest of my days  Sedley  But Captain tho' you was so fond of the ocean and had such success your nephew may not have the same inclinations and you should make some allowance  Helm  No that's not my waySo if he has a mind to gain the wind of my affection he must sheer off from the little frigate he has so long kept in chace and let me fit him out for a vovage in the Tempest which sails in a few weeks for the EastIndies  Sedley  Then your resolution is fixed  Helm  As the Poles  Sedley  And in his absence I suppose you intend attacking Miss Flora yourself  Helm  Right I have some thoughts of bearing down that way  Sedley  But Captain don't the great disparity of years between you and her deter you  Helm  No the more danger the more honourMayhap you may think it strange that after steering so long clear of a wife I should all of a sudden veer about and clap the matrimonial tack aboard  Helm  He that's long at sea will find the wind blow from every point of the compassI have seldom been six months ashore at one time since I was a boy so never had opportunity of coming alongside any but such as your Portsmouth or Plymouth fireships who damage every vessel they grapple with  Sedley  And them I suppose you avoided  Helm  Why aySo d'ye see being lately weatherbound in a trip I made to take observation of some land that lay ahead of Lady Younglove's I was forced to put into port at her house  Sedley  Where you saw her beautiful daughter  Helm  I did and in the three glasses we staid there she drew my heart with as strong an attraction as ever the loadstone did the needle  Sedley  Have you communicated your sentiments to the mother  Helm  No not yet but I intend shaping my course that way directly  Sedley  I believe Captain I can be of service to you in this affair  Helm  As how pray  Sedley  I am this moment going to pay my addresses to the mother  Helm  What the old hulkAh my boy I'm afraid you are out of your reckoning thereYou don't know the trim of herShe'll not be brought to obey either the helm or the sheet and if you'll take my advice you'll e'en let her drop to pieces where she lies at anchor  Sedley  I'll venture howeverThe more danger the more honour as you say and if you'll assist me I don't doubt of succeeding  Helm  Well well since the current of your inclination sets that way I shan't attempt to stem itthof let me tell you she saw her two former consorts go to the bottom and if you don't take care you'll share the same fate  Sedley  I confess I have a terrible prospect but nothing shall deter meIf you'll suspend your visit I'll return as soon as our interview is over and in form you of my success  Helm  Ay ay I shall lie by 'till thenBut harkye Sedley may I never strike an enemy's flag again if I would not rather be rak'd fore and aft by a whole French squadron than stand one broadside from such a Turkish pirate  Exeunt  SCENE  Miss  BLOOMER'S  Enter

so where could I six but on so deserving an object You seem surprized let us adjourn to Lady Younglove's and in our way thither I'll let you into my whole design  Miss Bloom  Here take my handMy heart has not been so much at ease a long timeAnd if girls were but wise enough to consult their own happiness instead of their trisling with fools and coxcombs they would seek for it where it can only be foundIn the arms of men of sense and virtue  Exeunt  End of the Fourth Act  ACT V  SCENE  Lady  YOUNGLOVE'S  Enter  FLORA  and  FRIPPERY  Frip  UPON my word Miss this is the most oddest affair I was ever extricated in during the whole current of my lifeAfter getting so artificially off as you did for Mr Sedley to dissuade your lovyer to return you to your mamma again instead of flourishing away to Scotland without redemptionWell I own its above my compacity to find out  Flora  Ay or mine eitherI'm sure I never looked so foolish in all my life as when I found we were not to be married  Frip  And well you might Miss to have all your schemes confisticated in such a manner  Flora  And then Frippery to be disappointed of such a delightful jaunt and exposed to the ridicule of all one's acquaintance'Tis enough to make me cry my eyes out  Frip  Ay my dear so it isAnd pray what end did he impose by this wise scheme  Flora  Why as by such a precipitate step we should entirely forfeit the favour of his uncle and my mamma without the least chance of recovery he persuaded Woodford to wait the issue of a scheme which he is going to execute immediatelyFor my part if it does succeed I shall lose half the pleasure I expected in being married in Scotland  Frip  You are right Miss and speak the sensations of most of the girls who go thereWhy I might have been married three years ago to Mr Scraper Lord Supple's footman but that we could not raise  money enough between us to get there and I was determined never to follow the vulgar fashion of being asked in church  Enter Lady  YOUNGLOVE  Lady Young  So my pretty runaway Miss I have you safe once more thanks to Mr Sedley and shall take care to keep you so  Flora  Perhaps you may be mistaken  aside  It is mighty well mamma but you would not like to be served so yourself  Lady Young  Go hussey you are a pert spoiled girlNow Frippery after this last generous act of Mr Sedley's I think I can't have the least doubt of his sincerity truth and tenderness  Frip  Doubt Madam it would be downright fidelity even to inspect him of such a thing  Lady Young  How tediously the lazy minutes drawl to a heart impatient of its bliss like mineFrippery do you think I am elegantly enough dressed for my bridal day  Frip  Elegant my LadyWhy you are the very moral of gentilityYour new corkrump becomes you mightilyAnd Mr Friz the hairdresser  your head is now at least half a foot higher  the handsome Duchess's  Lady Young  I am glad of itO the dear sweet  He promised to be here about this timeI  he was comeMy patience is almost exhausted  I tremble left any accident should rob me of my expected happiness  Flora  If she should be disappointed now  aside  Frip  I warrant your Ladyship need not fearNo no Mr Sedley is too much of a gentleman to refuse you any thing  Enter  SEDLEY  Captain  HELM  Miss  BLOOMER WOODFORD  and  SWAB  Sedley  My beauteous widow  Embracing  Lady Young  My long expected love  Flora  I wish my mamma would not be quite so fond before company  aside  Sedley  My dear Lady I have been obliged to trespass on your patience in order to bring these witnesses of my happiness  Helm  Ay ay widow we have crowded all the sail we could to be in at the first broadside and now as we all seem in the line suppose we hoist the signal for engaging  Lady Young  With all my heart Captain the sooner the better  Helm  Bravely spoken and I'll answer that you'll not be the first to cry out quarter  Lady Young  Oh Miss Bloomer I am happy to see youMy dear this is an unexpected favourWell now after your known partiality for Sedley can you forgive his infidelity to youI protest it gives me pain to rob you of such a sweet man  Miss Bloom  Your Ladyship is too goodI should be vain indeed were I to pretend to dispute a heart with one of your Ladyship's age and experience  Lady Young  Ha ha ha very pleasantAnd yet I really wonder what the men can see in me so to follow and admireEspecially when they sacrifice such youth and beautyBut I hope no bad consequences will follow your disappointmentNo hanging or drowningO lud I positively will give up all thoughts of him sooner than be the death of any person  Sedley  What a malicious devil  aside  I hope Madam I have now removed every shadow of doubt which your Ladyship might have entertained of my sincerity  Lady Young  Entirely Sir entirelyAnd in order to convince the world of my disinterested love for so deserving an objectPrevious to the ceremony which is to make me happy for everthere  is a deed of gift  Presenting it to Sedley  properly attested of half my fortune at present and the other half at my death  Sedley  My dear Lady what can I say to such unbounded such unmerited proofs of your goodness  Helm  Say zounds man say nothingThe widow had rather be thanked in deed than in word  Sedley  I am afraid Captain it is not in my power to please the Lady either way  Lady Young  O fie Mr Sedley don't think soI assure you I am not the unreasonable woman you take me for  Sedley  I am glad of it Madam as I must speedily put you to the trial  Lady Young  I think Sir I can stand any trial you'll please to make  Sedley  I wish we may find it so MadamBy your misplaced and with justice I may say ridiculous inclination my Lady for I cannot call it love you have been so far blindly infatuated as to make me sole master of your fortune without reserve  Lady Young  HowAm I awake  Helm  Faith I believe notBut there seems a storm rising that will quickly call all hands to work  Flora  Well I declare this is charming  Sedley  I am above making an improper use of such an advantageI designed at first but to serve my friend and now my end is fully answeredGive me leave therefore in the presence of this good company to restore these writings to their just owner    Delivers them to  FLORA  Lady Young  Oh I shall faint this is too much too much to bear  Sits  Flora  Poor mamma So it is indeed to lose both money and husbandSir I have not words to thank you as I ought    To  SEDLEY  Lady Young  Am I betrayed thenYou base deluder villain  Miss Bloom  Ha ha ha I hope your Ladyship will forgive his infidelity to youI protest it gives me pain to rob you of such a sweet man  Lady Young  Confusion are all my ravishing dreams of happiness come to thisOh the inconstancy of mankind there's neither love faith truth or honour amongst them  Miss Bloom  But I hope no bad consquences will follow your disappointmentNo hanging or drowningO lud I positively will give up all thoughts of him sooner than be the death of any person  Sedley  Come my Lady forgive this innocent artifice and look upon me as your best friendYou might have fallen a dupe to some designing villainwho taking advantage of your weakness would have ruined your family and entailed perpetual misery on yourself  Helm  So we are all run on a lee shore hereWhy widow you have kept a devilish bad reckoningBut I thought how it would beAs for your generosity Mr Sedley in favour of my little cockboat why I heartily thank youAnd as soon as the parson can tip us a cocket we'll steer away for matrimony harbour directly  Flora  I'm afraid Captain wind and tide are so much against you that you'll hardly be able to reach the port this trip  Helm  How's thisDo you refuse to take convoy too  Flora  No provided I chuse my confortI'm sure if I kept company with you I should soon be obliged to take you in tow  Helm  Whew  whistling  Here's a fresh gale sprung up  Lady Young  I think Captain you have kept a bad reckoning  Flora  And now Woodford thanks to Mr Sedley's  generosity I have it in my power to manifest my loveHere take my hand my fortune's more than sufficient to enable us to live happily though not splendidlyBut were it not be assured I would chearfully prefer poverty and a cottage with the object of my choice before riches and the most splendid palace with the man I dislike  Sedley  Right Madam the temple of Hymen was reared by virtue and only occasionally embellished by PlutusCaptain I am sure if you seriously consider every thing you will soon be of the young Lady's mind  Helm  Mayhap not for when I am resolved on doing any thing I never think about the matter  Woodf  Dear uncle make my happiness complete by restoring me to your favourRecollect what a cruel constraint you were putting upon both our inclinations  Helm  And you young dog do you recollect what a cruel constraint you are putting upon mine  Sedley  I know Captain you are a noblespirited worthyhearted BritonOnly reflect with such a great disparity of years and temper what a ridiculous figure you must make united to so blooming a girl  Flora  Ay for all the world like David and Abishag in our old tapestry hangings  Sedley  Come be generous and act like yourselfFill up the marriage settlements with your nephew's name instead of your own and receive the thanks nay the blessings of the young couple for so laudable an act  Woodf  Upon my knees uncle let me beg  Helm  Rise you land spanielWhen did you ever see a seaman in such a postureHad it been for a brother tar why I should not have held council about it  Lady Young  Well it is some comfort to find others in the same situation with myself  Helm  So after rigging myself out for a cruize to the unknown islands my orders are countermanded I am to be dock'd and laid up for life as unfit for service  Swab  Why an please your honour I do think your works are too much damaged to venture out to sea againYou'd certainly founder in the first storm  Helm  Do you think so SwabThen let us tack about and alter our courseCome hither nephew I forgive you what's pastYou shall go master in my stead and here are bills of freight and lading for the voyageBut harkee as you are a young seaman take my adviceDon't crowd too much sail or you'll be apt to overset  Woodf  Never fear uncle I'll steer by your directionyour goodness to me on this occasion  Helm  No fairweather

your addresses to me  Crosses over to him  Helm  To youAvast there sheer offNo sooner than be tack'd to such a spitfire I'd turn a gun into my powderroom and blow myself up  Lady Young  A monsterA savage bearFit only for Greenland  Helm  Well a Greenland bear is better than a Lapland witch at any time  Lady Young  Come along FripperyThe men have neither eyes ears or understanding  Exeunt Lady Young and Frip  Helm  Ay ay let her have searoom enough or she'll run foul of some of you  Swab  Please your honour since you are sharing the prizemoney I hope you'll not be angry if I put in my claim

 No your honour never while I have life she seems a neat tightsailing thing and her upper works are in such nice order that I should like of all things to go master  Helm  But hearkee have you hail'd her yet to know whether she'd chuse to take you on board  Swab  Why no your honour I'm too good a seaman to launch out on so long a cruize without my commander's leave  Helm  Well then Swab if that's the case after her directly and bring her too as soon as possible  Swab  I warrant your honour to give a good account of herHe must stand many a hard broadside that takes her from me  Exit  Enter Miss

brought to so agreeable a conclusionI only beg leave to remarkThat though our follies and vices justly deserve the comic lashYet when instead of persevering we nobly acknowledge our errors and
