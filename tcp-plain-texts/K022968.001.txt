COTEMPORARY WRITERS NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED  IN TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  foliis tantum ne carmina manda  Ne turbata volent rapidis ludibria ventis  VIRGIL  pulverem Olympicum  Collegisse juvat  HOR  LONDON PRINTED FOR H BALDWIN T LONGMAN R BALDWIN G ROBINSON T CASLON G KEARSLY AND J RIDLEY  PREFACE  HOWEVER sparing modern Authors are in giving due praise to their Cotemporaries they seem to be more united in acknowledging the merit of those who to use the language of the Psalmist  "have ceased from their labours"  Writers whose works have stood the test of years have acquired a kind of prescriptive title to celebrity not on account of that superior wisdom which is often attributed to times we have survived or the supposed degeneracy of the present but because what has been long known has been more reflected upon and what undergoes this examination is better understood  In the catalogue of Authors whose writings have met with public reception none have been more justly celebrated than those of POPE and  his Cotemporaries  insomuch  that their names have not only been honourably recorded but the period in which they lived has been preeminently distinguished by the title of the  Augustan Age  Other points of time have here and there given birth to a great genius who like a leading star has enlightened the horizon of literature but no particular aera at least of our history has produced so general and collected a light as this a light which at once shone upon every part of science at the same time that it illuminated the circle of morality  What could have been the cause why such a cluster of great men flourished at the same period of time and why we have had no similar succession ever since Whether the first arose from the emulation of authorship which like the collision of hard bodies struck a fire from each other or that the latter was occasioned by the number of finished pieces they gave to the world which has ever since occasioned a kind of literary satiety is a question perhaps not so readily decided This however  is as generally known as assented to that from the very few eminent geniuses who have arisen since the flourishing days of this illustrious Junto nature seems to have indulged herself in a temporary repose  When Authors therefore have thus long engaged the public attention when their works are read with avidity and universally receive a classical stamp those who can add any thing to their illustration and recover by time what has eluded former diligence bring an acceptable present to the public It is with good Authors as with good men the nearer and more intimately they are viewed the more we are able to set a proper value upon their characters and look up to them as more enforcing examples of imitation and instruction  Under this idea the Editor thinks he need make no apology in presenting the public with two additional volumes to the Works of Mr POPE which contain such of that celebrated Bard's pieces in prose and verse together with  many of his Cotemporaries as for particular and local reasons were then suppressed might have been mislaid or perhaps got into too remote hands to be collected with ease He is aware at the same time that the public rage for the remains of celebrated men has occasioned many spurious productions being fathered on them under the wellknown titles of  second parts  and  posthumous works  Our best Authors and principally our best have been subject to such impositions which tho' they have been in time detected have yet answered the illiberal purposes of such a temporary publication The Editor of the present Work to get clear of the shadow of an imputation in this line is the first to remind the public that several of the pieces here exhibited originally appeared in  The St James's Chronicle  The favourable reception they met with in that fugitive mode of publication first suggested to him a wish to give them a more durable form he accordingly communicated  this wish to his friends who assisted him in his design so much beyond his expectation that instead of  one  volume his original intention he has by their favour been able to make out  two  composed of such materials as he flatters himself will acquit him of the charge of an hasty or selfinterested compiler  Many of the  Letters  and  Poems  of which this publication consists were transcribed with accuracy from the originals in the collections of the late Lords Oxford and Bolingbroke who are well known to have lived in the strictest intimacy with Mr POPE as well as his literary friends and associates Some of the  latter  will be found no way inferior to other productions of the same Authors All of the fragments more or less carry the marks of a master Others of the Letters are taken from pamphlets printed some years ago which in the detached manner they then appeared will it is to be hoped fully justify their present mode of publication They for the most part treat of critical  friendly humorous and literary subjects and abstracted from these throw new lights upon the character of Mr POPE as a man  His Letters to his favourite Miss Blount lead to the support of a charge often urged against him  his want of original invention  for tho' the extent of his erudition and his elegant turn of thinking gave him a superiority to all his Cotemporaries in polishing to a degree of  originality  other people's sentiments yet here whether from the carelessness arising from intimate friendship idleness or the supposition of his not being detected by his fair correspondent he has committed a plagiarism on Voiture which would be unworthy a much less celebrated pen than his  His Letter to Jabez Hughes Esq brother to the author of the Siege of Damascus with that of his to Mr Dennis the critic are melancholy proofs that the greatest genius cannot always shield men from duplicity of conduct in their literary characters and bring  another corroboration to the testimony of Gay's assertion that  "Wits are gamecocks to each other"  But if these Letters shew the weaknesses perhaps the inseparable weaknesses from human nature others will shew some of its fairest and brightest sides they will exhibit the strongest  traits  of his humanity and friendship his wit his learning and his morals they will confirm his more than Roman affection to his parents and particularly to his aged mother whose life he watched over with such soothing solicitude and exemplary reverence as force us for a while to turn from the lustre of his talents to admire the superiority of his silial character  A few Poems and Letters will be found in this collection which appeared only in some of the editions of his works in none of them quite perfect which are particularly distinguished in the latter by the additional paragraphs being printed in Italics This will  justify their republication here more particularly as many of them are written in that unreserved open manner which his original Editor might have a wish to conceal for many reasons that now no longer remain at present the restoration of them can neither indulge vanity nor gratify spleen they may be read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure and are therefore only to be praised as that object is obtained  To many in an age like this where hypocrisy in morals is much practised as is shewn by our dramatic and other writers perhaps a few of the Poems may appear too loose and descriptive particularly "The Farewel to London" the conclusion of the "Address to Miss Blount on leaving Town" and some passages in "The Sober Advice from Horace c" by Mr POPE together with the Poem called "Virtue in Danger" and others by Lady Mary Wortley Montague but on a proper examination this charge of indecency will be found to lie more in the readers turn of thinking than the defects of  the writer A poet who wants to give his subject due force should comply with the rules of his profession by using  "proper words in proper places"  and provided he keeps a steady eye on the moral of his piece the more he colours from nature the more he assists his design whilst the  hint  and  double entendrez  those mock draperies of delicacy often create a more indecent meaning than the circumstance will allow and urge the young and inexperienced reader more to the exercise of his passions than his reason  Swift's delicacy has been often arraigned on the same principle and his "Lady's Dressing Room" and others of his Poems of a similar stamp are ever sure to be adduced as convincing proofs of this charge But where is the woman of real sense and cleanliness offended at it Conscious she deserves no such reprehension in her own conduct she sees the general force of the satire only directed to the slatterns of her sex and is pleased with the hope of a consequent reformation In short the Editor is entirely  of opinion that the same rule respecting decency which a modern artist has laid down in painting will equally hold good in poetry  "It is not in shewing or concealing the naked that modesty or lewdness depend They arise entirely from the choice and intentions of the artist himself A great mind can raise great or pleasing ideas though he shews all the parts of the body in their natural way whilst the Cheapside prints of the  Buck and Quaker Girl  the charms of the  Garter  and  Highwind  are proofs that very lewd ideas might be produced though little or nothing of the naked be discovered and there is no doubt but that the  Venus De Medicis  might be converted into a very lewd figure  by dressing her out for that purpose  Barry on the Arts  "  The letters which passed between Mr POPE and his booksellers which are to be found in the second of these volumes may appear to those who are to be no otherwise  pleased with human genius than seeing it eternally on the stretch rather too trisling and as the public voice is not a little raised upon like occasions the Editor thinks it may be necessary to say something on this subject  It is objected that most of our great writers no sooner establish a reputation for their works but there are never wanting interested people who preferring a private lucre either to the fame of the author or national honour busy themselves in gleaning up their most uninteresting thoughts on the most uninteresting subjects such as letters to tradesmen c and that kind of domestic correspondence which to use the language of a modern author  "a wise man should be ashamed to remember"  Was a collection of this kind purposely made for the filling up a volume without the least regard to amusement curiosity or instruction it must soon defeat its own purposes for however common readers may for  a while be pleased with the novelty the reprobation it must receive from men of sense would soon distinguish it as the  mortal part  of an author and in this state consign it to oblivion But trifling as these Letters appear to be many of them referring to literary business help to settle dates and explain references which perhaps before were not quite so intelligible and like those well digested questions on a legal examination which however simple they may appear in respect to their immediate enquiries are yet important as they strengthen or elucidate a fact in their connections Others will serve to shew the degree of intimacy between the poet and bookseller of that time the process of publication and many other little anecdotes of parties and places too  trifling  to be otherwise recorded but by this mode of preservation and yet too  curious  at least to literary enquirers to fall down the stream of obscurity  The Editor having now made those apologies which he thought necessary for offering these volumes to the public he will no longer  detain them from the exercise of their own judgement He cannot however conclude without assuring them that his design in this compilation was no more than to collect in one view such pieces of our celebrated English Bard and his Cotemporaries as may be lost to the world from a fugitive mode of publication and others which might be equally lost from their being only open to the inspection of the few In this as he has spared no industry or expence himself and stands much indebted to the researches and interest of many of his friends he hopes to have the merit of a faithful and useful Compiler and that these volumes may not be thought improper appendages to the present edition of POPE'S WORKS  CONTENTS OF THE

Didascalic is the most valuable if aiming at the good of mankind be what justly entitles any thing to that character The descriptive kind is like a fine landskip where you meet with two or three principal figures the rest is all rocks rivulets hanging woods and verdant lawns amusing to the eye shewing the taste of the painter but carrying little instruction along with it But the Didascalic is like a curious piece of history painting where every figure must be highly wrought every passion strongly represented all contributing in their several degrees to express the main design in short it must be a finished piece  That this is a very difficult work may be collected from the small number of those poets who have ever attempted it In the early ages of the Grecians I remember none who have wrote any thing in this way but old Hesiod Aratus and Nicander for Dionysius the Periegetic and  Agesilaus Oppian's father was a man of great learning and merit as well as wealth and power in the city of Anazarbus in Cilicia where he liv'd Severus making a progress came to that town and Agesilaus being not at the procession to meet the Emperor at his entrance probably on account of his age and infirmities that prince to punish him for so heinous a crime banish'd the poor old man to Malta Oppian to amuse his father under his misfortune took to writing of poetry and afterwards dedicated his Halieutics to the Emperor's son The Emperor was so pleas'd with the poem that he order'd him a piece of gold for each line and offer'd him any other favour he would ask The first part of the story is not at all wonderful but I must confess the last part is a little surprizing  Oppian liv'd not 'till the  time of the Roman Emperors Hesiod's works and days is the only piece remaining that is allow'd to be genuine without dispute but by Virgil's and especially Manilius's compliments to him 'tis highly probable he wrote others and perhaps more valuable ones tho' Quintilian allows him the  Palma in illo medio genere dicendi  only and Le Fevre is much more hard upon him when he makes him little better than an almanackmaker and his work a mean performance Paterculus and Plutarch set him next to Homer as well in the value of his works as in the period of his age says Mr Kennet but perhaps that may be the other extreme Aratus wrote a poem in two books which he calls the Phaenomena and Diosemeia the one astronomical giving an account of the situation and the affection of the heavenly bodies the other astrological shewing the particular influences arising from their various dispositions and relations  Kennet's lives of the Greek poets  Tully commends him for his versification  and Quintilian says he has fully answer'd his argument which put together should make up a pretty good character As to Nicander Vossius places him amongst his Greek historians but allows him to have been  egregius grammaticus    poeta    medicus  His surviving works are however only poetry upon poisons and the methods of cure for them Of the two latter Greek poets Dionysius and Oppian the one wrote a survey of the world and the other Cynegetics and Halieutics in both which 'tis certain there are very fine parts however judgments may differ about them  Amongst the Romans Lucretius and Manilius may justly be said to be the chief of the Didascalic poets They both wrote with all the fire of their youth about 'em for neither of them liv'd to be old I have always fancy'd Manilius imitated Lucretius in his manner the beginning of his books being pretty much in the same way besides that he loses no occasion of launching out into descriptions and is florid to a fault He has likewise some reflections  The beginning of the fourth book  on the follies of men so very much of a piece with what you meet with in the th book of Lucretius that one would almost think them taken from thence In general it may be said they are both very noble poems tho' that of Manilius is far from being finish'd as it might have been if the author had liv'd What errors are to be found in the philosophy of the one  and the astronomy of the other are owing perhaps as much to the age of the world at that time as their own and their beauties may in some measure atone for their faults  Virgil's Georgics are in the same kind tho' the subjects are of less dignity and I don't know whether I might not likewise add Ovid on the account of his Fasti the most correct of all his works Gratius too about the same time wrote his Cynegetics which are very justly esteem'd  Amongst the moderns Fracastorius's  Syphilis  Quillet's  Callipaedia  and Vida's Art of Poetry are the best poems of this sort Rapin of gardens and Vanier's  Praedium Rusticum  are not without their merit but much inferior to the others In our own language too we have some poems of this instructive kind The Essays on Poetry Translated Verse and Criticism are fine instances of the worth and excellency of this manner of writing to which may be very truly apply'd what Dr Young says of Satyr  " Heroes and gods make other poems fine  " Plain satyr calls for sense in every line  Universal Passion Sat II  "  The strength of just observations convey'd in smooth and flowing numbers has a prevailing influence insinuates itself into the mind almost imperceptibly and makes a more lasting impression there than one would easily imagine 'Tis true these subjects are purely critical and so of less consequence to mankind  in general but yet polishing the understanding improving the judgment and regulating the taste are far from being things indifferent to the world since they tend not a little to the shaming out of it that rusticity and barbarism those follies and affectations in one word all that littleness of mind which is so effectual a bar in the way of generous and noble undertakings But we have had of late an undeniable proof that the finest and most useful sort of philosophy which consists in the knowledge of ourselves may be convey'd in such clear strong easy and affecting strains at the same time convincing and captivating the understanding that there remains no doubt but that poetry in the hands of a great genius may be made as beneficial as ever it has been entertaining to mankind The latter effect is indeed what has been generally most aim'd at as it is compass'd with less difficulty to the writer and meets with a more universal reception amongst the common sort of readers  Nec in turbam nec turbae carmina condam  MANIL L II  Imagery fine colouring and bright antitheses often disguise the want of justness and force and by pleasing the imagination do as it were steal away from the judgment or sometimes impose upon it as shadows pass for substances with weak distemper'd or fanciful men  The  Os magna sonaturum  of Horace would make one almost think the muse must never appear without  her buskins and that all simplicity of expression were to be totally banish'd out of poetical writings 'Tis true the Epic Poem the Ode and the Tragedy very often require and consequently justify the use of elevated language as it may be more suitable to the greatness of the subjects and better fitted to raise the several passions they are design'd to work upon But where the appeal lies only to the understanding selfevident truths naturally and beautifully express'd can never fail of the approbation of a sound head and a good taste And even Horace himself as elevated and great a poet as he must be allow'd in his  Odes  appears to much more advantage in his  Sermones  and  Epistles  where as my Lord Roscommon observes on another occasion  " Fancy labours less but judgment more"  Sir John Denham's Cooper's Hill has met with universal applause tho' its subject seems rather descriptive than instructing but 'tis not the hill the river nor the stag chace 'tis the good sense and the fine reflections so frequently interspers'd and as it were interwoven with the rest that gives it the value and will make it as was said of true wit everlasting like the sun  The late Mr Prior's Solomon seems to have cost him much time and pains and was I believe his favourite performance He is in some doubt whether to call it a Didascalic or Heroic poem It has  indeed something of both and yet strictly speaking is perfectly neither It has not fable machinery nor variety enough to be an Heroic poem and it is too diffusive and luxuriant in the style too florid and full of descriptions to be of the Didascalic sort In general it may be justly said to be a very fine piece though I must confess I cannot help giving the preference to his Alma in which the design is more closely pursued carried on with more spirit and never loses your attention  Upon the whole what Mr Dryden has said in the preface to his  Religio Laici  is I think very true  "The expressions of a poem design'd purely for instruction ought to be plain and natural and yet majestic for here the poet is presum'd to be a kind of lawgiver and those three qualities which I have named are proper to the legislative style The florid elevated and figurative way is for the passions for love and hatred fear and anger are begotten in the soul by shewing their objects out of their true proportion either greater than the life or less but instruction is to be given by shewing them what they naturally are A man is to be cheated into passion but to be reasoned into truth"  The following short piece may be perhaps a little too pompously introduced by the foregoing observations all I shall say for it is I endeavoured to  follow Mr Dryden's rules how far I have succeeded I can be no proper judge myself But whatever may be said of the poetry and about that I am very indifferent the sentiments must surely be allowed to be just and good and I am entirely of Mr Prior's opinion  "I had rather be thought a good Englishman which is but another word for an honest man than the best poet or greatest scholar that ever wrote"  AN ESSAY ON HUMAN LIFE  The Essay on Human Life was printed soon after the Essay on Man was ushered into the world by the same publisher and asserted in the title to be written by the same author This circumstance was never contradicted by Mr Pope The hint for the performance was probably taken from Dr Swift's letter July where he observes  From these volumes of letters might be collected the best system that ever was wrote for the conduct of Human Life  As to the other poems they speak for themselves and as they were universally acknowledged to be Mr Pope's at their first appearance they will not we presume be disputed now  By Mr POPE  PLEASURE but cheats us with an empty name  Still seems to vary yet is still the same  Amusement's all its utmost skill can boast  By use it lessens and in thought is lost  The youth that riots and the age that hoards  Folly that sacrifices things to words  Pride wit and beauty in one taste agree  'Tis sensual or 'tis mental luxury  Sad state of nature doom'd to fruitless pain  Something to wish and want but never gain  Restless we live and disappointed die  Unhappy tho' we know not how nor why  Reason perhaps may lend her gen'rous aid  Reason which never yet her trust betray'd  Let her direct us in the doubtful strife  Let her conduct us thro' the maze of life  Is human reason then from weakness free  Partakes she not of our infirmity  Can she apply with neverfailing art  The healing balsam to the wounded part  Correct those errors which the passions cause  And teach the will to follow wisdom's laws  Alas experience but too plainly shews  That man can act against the truths he knows  By customs led or by allurements won  Discern that evil which he cannot shun  Whate'er we do the motive's much the same  'Tis impulse governs under reason's name  Each eagerly some fav'rite end pursues  And diff'rent tempers furnish diff'rent views  Is it for fear of wrong or love of right  That statesmen labour or that warriors fight  T'enrich his country does the sailor brave  The cruel pirate and the threat'ning wave  In search of truth unwearied sages try  By certain rules to fix uncertainty  No 'tis desire and hope that drive them on  Thus greatest things for meanest ends are done  Selflove howe'er disguis'd misunderstood  Howe'er misplac'd is still the sov'reign good  Virtue or wisdom but the vain pretence  These may direct but passions influence  Presumptuous man why boasts thou thy freewill  By constitution doom'd to good or ill  What feeble checks are all those studied rules  Unpractis'd lessons of the useless schools  Say can thy art oppos'd to nature's force  Obstruct her motions or suspend her course  Go change in Africa their sable hue  Or make our Europe bring her negroes too  Roll back the tides forbid the streams to flow  Nor let this earth returning seasons know  Slave to thyself whilst lord of all beside  Surmount thy weakness or renounce thy pride  That moving pow'r which first produc'd the whole  To every thing has fix'd a certain goal  Thither all tend and must their circles run  For such the order when the whole begun  To diff'rent creatures diff'rent ranks assign'd  Man claims the first as of a nobler kind  How just that claim what wisdom must decide  Reason is his alone by which 'tis try'd  Inferior creatures silently submit  'Tis his to talk and therefore to have wit  Thus haughty Greece despis'd the world around  And barb'rous all she understood not found  Look o'er the wide creation see how all  Its several parts obey the Maker's call  The earth how fertile and how rich the sea  In various salts for nature's chymistry  Slow air digests what burning suns exhale  And dews and snows and rains by turns prevail  Beasts birds and reptiles see 'em all conspire  To act whate'er their sev'ral states require  But wiser man disdains this meaner part  Nature with him must still give way to art  Vain of conceit he boasts his fancy'd skill  And arbitrary rules the world at will  Now fierce and cruel then as mild and kind  Each action owing to each turn of mind  One day a friend the next as great a foe  As humour pique caprice or int'rests go  Wisdom and folly thus by turns preside  And chance alone inclines to either side  Ask the bold freeman or the coward slave  What makes one abject and the other brave  What gives to sools their faith to knaves their wiles  To cynicks fourness and to flatt'rers smiles  This one great truth must stand by all confest  Some ruling passion lurks in ev'ry breast  That weakness by a specious name they call  For 'tis that weakness still which governs all  Wisely the springs of action we conceal  Thus sordidness is prudence fury zeal  Ambition makes the public good her care  And hypocrites the mask of saintship wear  Inur'd to falshood we ourselves deceive  Oft what we wish we fancy we believe  We call that judgment which is only will  And as we act we learn to argue ill  Like bigots who their various creeds desend  By making reason still to system bend  Customs or int'rests govern all mankind  Some biass cleaves to the unguarded mind  Thro' this as in a false or flatt'ring glass  Things seem to change their natures as they pass  Objects the same in diff'rent lights appear  And but the colours which we give 'em wear  Error and fraud from this great source arise  All fools are modish and all knaves are wise  Who does not boast some merit of his own  Tho' to himself perhaps 'tis only known  Each suits reward to his own fav'rite vice  Pride has its crowns and lust its paradise  Bonze priest and dervise all in this agree  That heaven must be pomp or luxury  Man slave to sense no higher bliss can know  Still measures things above by things below  Joys much the same but differ in degree  As time enlarg'd becomes eternity  How vain is all that science we pursue  Scorn'd by the many useless to the few  Since short of truth our utmost labours end  Who knows but ign'rance is our greatest friend  The fruitless pains but shew the weakness more  And we like misers 'midst our wealth are poor  Much hoarded learning but like lumber lies  Or ends in guesswork and obscurities  What tho' proud Greece her seven sages boast  The names alone remain the race is lost  Satyrs and Centaurs too might live of old  For so we are in ancient story told  But should we doubt in this our faithless age  Who can produce a Centaur or a sage  Such mighty births were nature's first essays  The lusty offspring of her youthful days  Our latter times can no such wonders shew  But what were giants then are pigmies now  Of all the painful follies of mankind  Still to be seeking what they ne'er must find  Is sure the greatest not unlike the toil  Of him who labours in a barren soil  Beyond our state if our fond wishes tend  Means must be vain where we mistake the end  Pride whispers mighty projects in the ear  Bids us be great be wise be happy here  But sad experience shews the laws of fate  And teaches us to know ourselves too late  Error is a distemper of the mind  Hard to be cur'd because 'tis hard to find  So mixt and blended with our very frame  It lurks secure and borrows reason's name  In diff'rent persons diff'rent ways it springs  'Tis factiousness in subjects pride in kings  Boundless alike they in extremes agree  These in oppression those in anarchy  Both aim at what 'twere ruin to obtain  A civil phrenzy or a tyrant reign  The wise must into nature's secrets pry  The weak believe they know not what nor why  And we may equally deluded call  Who doubt of nothing as who doubt of all  Profane or pious bigotry's the same  The motives terror avarice or fame  Opinion is but int'rest in disguise  And right and wrong in strength of parties lies  Some wou'd be happy know nor want nor care  Others still find more evils than there are  Whilst truth unheeded in the midway lies  And all extremes are like absurdities  Wrong turns of head are nature's greatest curse  Improving everyday from bad to worse  In some odd light all objects still they view  Thus true with them is false and false is true  In trifles solemn diligent and wise  Important things as trifles they despise  Caressing enemies their friends they shun  And doat on knaves by whom they are undone  Deaf to advice or taking wrong for right  They boldly blunder on in reason's spite  And under clearer light's obscure pretence  Are the antipodes of common sense  Wou'd you persuade a wretch intent on pelf  Tho' he starves others not to starve himself  To sence at lead his sapless trunk from cold  Nor seem as fond of tatters as of gold  No he's too cunning for your fly design  You'd have him like yourself be poor and fine  But he in spite of envy richer grows  And scorns the luxury of meat and cloaths  Ask the ambitious why he wastes his life  In needless struggles and uncertain strife  Why not in peace enjoy what plenty gives  So the obscure the weak the lazy lives  Exalted spirits have a nobler aim  And know no happiness but toil and fame  Well must it suit a selfish hollow heart  To act the honest patriot's gen'rous part  No tool of party nor no slave of state  No mean dependant on the guilty great  Boldly he pleads for liberty and laws  Content to perish in his country's cause  When lo a ray divine of favour gleams  Quite diff'rent topicks then become his themes  Old friends old notions are at once forgot  And shame and wages are the hireling's lot  The little mind whose joy in mischief lies  Hates all mankind but most the good and wise  Proud of his shame he boasts his spitefull skill  And places all his worth in doing ill  But baseborn fear oft checks what rage devis'd  And leaves him disappointed and despis'd  Endless the task to point the various ways  How each wrong head its diff'rent gifts displays  How poverty in boasts its wants wou'd hide  And meanness shews itself in awkward pride  How knaves are cunning at their own expence  And coxcombs fancy forwardness is sense  Vain is th' attempt to be what heaven denies  As vain the art that weakness to disguise  Prudence alone can teach the useful skill  T'improve the good and to correct the ill  True wisdom lies in practice more than rules  For what are maxims when apply'd to fools  Of wit and folly reason all you can  Who acts most wisely is the wisest man  Each state of life has its peculiar view  Alike in each there is a false and true  This point to fix is reason's use and end  On this success all other must depend  But in this point no error can be small  To deviate e'er so little ruins all  The mark once miss'd however near you aim  Miss'd by an inch or furlong 'tis the same  Who sets out wrong is more than half undone  Error has many ways and truth but one  Wrong estimates wrong conduct must produce  They lose the blessing that mistake its use  Who value wealth or pow'r but more or less  As that can riot or as this oppress  What say they else but that they both are given  To execute the wrath of angry heaven  Fools ever vain at some distinction aim  And fancy madness is the way to fame  No matter how the deathless name's acquir'd  By countries ravag'd or a  Erostratus a very obscure

Prince unto this land  Skill'd in the arts of war and peace  Your birth does call you to command  Your nature does incline to peace  II  When Holland by her foes opprest  No longer could sustain their weight  To a native Prince they thought it best  To recommend their dying state  III  Your very name did France expell  Those conquer'd towns which lately cost  So little blood unto you fell  With the same ease they once were lost  IV  'Twas not your force did them defeat  They neither felt your sword nor fire  But seemed willing to retreat  And to your greatness did conspire  V  Nor have you since ingrateful been  When at Seneff you did expose  And at Mount Cassal your own men  Whereby you might secure your soes  VI  Let Maestricht siege enlarge your name  And your retreat at Charleroy

Gay has even adopted the measure of his original and has comprized his design in almost the same number of lines viz in twenty one octave stanza's instead of nineteen  written by Mr GAY Upon Mr POPE's having finished his Translation of HOMER's ILIAD  I  LONG hast thou friend been absent from thy soil  Like patient Ithacus at siege of Troy  I have been witness of thy six years toil  Thy daily labours and thy night's annoy  Lost to thy native land with great turmoil  On the wide sea oft threat'ning to destroy  Methinks with thee I've trod Sigaean ground  And heard the shores of Hellespont resound  II  Did I not see thee when thou first sett'st sail  To seek adventures fair in Homer's land  Did I not see thy sinking spirits sail  And wish thy bark had never left the strand  Ev'n in mid ocean often didst thou quail  And oft lift up thy holy eye and hand  Praying the Virgin dear and saintly choir  Back to the port to bring thy bark entire  III  Chear up my friend thy dangers now are o'er  Methinksnay sure the rising coasts appear  Hark how the guns salute from either shore  As thy trim vessel cuts the Thames so fair  Shouts answ'ring shouts from Kent and Effex roar  And bells break loud thro' every gust of air  Bonfires do blaze and bones and cleavers ring  As at the coming of some mighty king  IV  Now pass we Gravesend with a friendly wind  And Tilbury's white fort and long Blackwall  Greenwich where dwells the friend of human kind  More visited than or her park or hall  Withers the good and with him ever join'd  Facetious Disney greet thee first of all  I see his chimney smoke and hear him say  Duke that's the room for Pope and that for Gay  V  Come in my friends here shall ye dine and lie  And here shall breakfast and here dine again  And sup and breakfast on if ye comply  For I have still some dozens of champaign  His voice still lessens as the ship sails by  He waves his hand to bring us back in vain  For now I see I see proud London's spires  Greenwich is lost and Deptford dock retires  VI  Oh what a concourse swarms on yonder key  The sky reechoes with new shouts of joy  By all this show I ween 'tis Lord May'rs day  I hear the voice of trumpet and Hautboy  No now I see them nearoh these are they  Who come in crowds to welcome thee from Troy  Hail to the bard whom long as lost we mourn'd  From siege from battle and from storm return'd  VII  Of goodly dames and courteous knights I view  The silken petticoat and broider'd vest  Yea Peers and mighty Dukes with ribbands blue  True blue fair emblem of unstained breast  Others I see as noble and

of Howard flies  Now Harvey fair of face I mark full well  With thee youth's youngest daughter sweet Lepell  IX  I see two lovely sisters hand in hand  The fair hair'd Martha and Teresa brown  Madge

the triumph bears his part  This is no more than a compliment to the vanity of Sir Godfrey which Pope and other wits were always putting to the strongest trials  "Sir Godfrey says Pope I believe if God Almighty had had your assistance the world would have been formed more perfect"  "Fore God says  Kneller  I believe so"  He was likewise as Mr Walpole observes very free and singular in his conversation on religion This adulation of Pope Addison Prior c appears to have heighten'd his natural absurdities as he had not discernment enough to discover that they were only foothing him to paint for them gratis or diverting themselves at the expence of his credulity Sir Godfrey had drawn for Pope the statues of Apollo Venus and Hercules Pope paid for them with the following stanza  " What god what genius did the pencil move  " When  Kneller  painted these  " 'Twas friendship warm as Phoebus kind as love  " And strong as Hercules"  On these lines which their author wisely

Treasurer  The epigrammatical Petition of your Lordship's most humble Servant JOHN GAY  I'M no more to converse with the swains  But go where fine people resort  One can live without money on plains  But never without it at court  Yet if when with swains I did gambol  I array'd me in silver and blue  When abroad and in courts I shall ramble  Pray my Lord how much money will do  The Duchess of QUEENS BERRY's Reply to King GEORGE II when she was forbid to appear at Court  Thursday Feb  THAT the Duchess of Queensberry is surpriz'd and well pleas'd that the King hath given her so agreeable a command as to stay from Court where she never came for diversion but to bestow a great civility upon the King and Queen She hopes by such an unprecedented order as this that the King will see as few as he wishes at his court particularly such as dare think or speak the truth I dare not do otherwise and ought not nor could I have imagined that it would not have been the highest compliment that I could possibly pay the King to endeavour to support truth and innocence in his house  C QUEENSBERRY  Particularly when the King and Queen had both told me that they had not read Mr Gay's play I have certainly done right then to stand to my own word rather than his Grace of Grafton's who hath neither made use of truth judgment or honour through this whole affair either for himself or his friends  What follows was written by her Grace at the bottom of the copies of the above answer which she gave to her particular friends  "This is the answer I gave in writing to the Vice Chamberlain to read to the King in answer to the message he brought me from the King to refrain coming to court"  All the seven following Copies of VERSES were written on the foregoing Subject  THY dull request my friend give o'er  Against that place I vow  Whence truth was long discharg'd before  And beauty's banish'd now  On the forbidding Command to the Duchess of QUEENSBERRY  HOW blest the court How loft the fair  Who's banish'd thence where all submit  Such is our prudent monarch's care  To Cibber's  The mention of  Cibber  's modesty is sufficiently authorized by the following particulars in the th chapter of his  Apology  c  "After the vast success of that new species of poetry the  Beggar's Opera  the year following I was so stupid as to attempt something of the same kind upon quite a different foundation that of recommending virtue and innocence c"  This passage which is too long to be quoted here will shew at once the cause of his enmity to Gay and afford a specimen of his very singular modesty It will likewise illustrate the other pieces of poetry written on the same occasionIt may be observed that the  Middlesex justices  have done  Mr Cibber  the honour to adopt his sentiments concerning the immorality of the  Beggar's Opera  Happy  Cibber  modesty and wit  True wit can never want support  Where learned Grafton's the Mecaenas  And ladies must adore that court  Where Ganymede takes place of Venus  BOILEAU Sat IX  EN vain contre le Cid un ministre se ligue  Tout Paris pour Chimene a les yeux de Rodrigue  The same paraphrased  IN vain was ministerial breath  In vain monarchic folly  All eyes saw Walpole in Macheath  And Queensberry in Polly  To the Duchess of QUEENSBERRY  LET the knight  Sir Robert Walpole  on beauty low'r  Loveliest ornament of pow'r  Let him at a stager's nod  Painted prostitute and proud  Hate to real charms display  Basely sworn to ruin Gay  Happy Gay ordain'd to know  Such a friend and such a foe  What though wit and sense to love  Courtiers' idle rage may move  Calmly you unhurt retreat  Banish'd by the vulgar great  Take your beauties thence away  Full revenge is to obey  Let the meaner rank and face  Borrow lustre from the place  There where friendship false beguiles  Basely murd'ring while it smiles  There where proud despotic will  Boasts the power of doing ill  There where paltry gold outvies  All the lustre of your eyes  Generous and just and fair  Why ah why should you be there  To JOHNNY GAY  THE great ones justly Johnny Gay  Have damn'd thy second opera  And to Macheath refuse to give  The favour of three

I  SAYS a friend to a knight shall a friend by whose skill  All the houses are taught all their parts ev'ry day  Let Lincolnsinnfields house do just what it will  There's another Macheath sir prohibit the play  Cibber's your friend  A play he hath penn'd  This play was  Love in a Riddle  See Cibber's Apology for his Life c    In which there is nothing that can be apply'd  For he does not mention  The word bribe or pension  Nor any one vice that can fit you beside  II  So Macheath was forbid by authority good  To Cibber were sent many hands to applaud  But in this house it seems men judg'd as they wou'd  Not by promises sway'd nor by promises aw'd  Harsh catcalls sound  The hiss goes round  The courtiers join hisses and give up the wight  As in this house they show it  They dare damn the poet  Who knows but in t'other they'll give up the knight  III  But Young  Sir William Young who had likewise a hand in some operatical performances  at this omen is nothing dismay'd  He'd shew to the town as 'twas certainly fit  If Broome Floyd and Roome  Broome  had been a menial servant to  Ben Jonson  He was the original author of the  Jovial Crew  which was afterwards altered by  Mr Roome  the son of our first undertaker and since by another hand Concerning  Floyd  even the  Dunciad  is silent  could come to his aid  That the friends of the ministry might have some wit  And so they took  An old play book  Writ in Ben Jonson's time by his man master Broome  Some speeches they mangled  Some songs intertangled  Sing the courtiers in praise of Broome Floyd and Roome  IV  'Tis said that this piece in good breeding so nice  Can ne'er any gentleman's pleasure molest  For they mention no modish no politic vice  They censure no knaves nor make coxcombs a jest  Thus Young and Broome  And Floyd and Roome  Have learnt to be mannerly cautious and sage  From Gay's Newgate satire  Whose vulgar illnature  Treated rich rogues and poor rogues alike on the stage  V  Then sure we must own it was prudent and fit  To stop our Macheath in his second attack  And Cibber to set up against it for wit  Whom two pair of bards with a sequel should back  'Twas Floyd and Broome  And Young and Roome  Clap your hands ye good courtiers and grin at this play  In two days dy'd Cibber  But Young will go glibber  And all these court poets be damn'd the first day  Written in Mr GAY's WORKS  Presented to a

 With rival beams and every grace is thine  Yet three distinguish'd by thy early voice  Excite our praise and well deserve thy choice  Immortal Truth in heaven itself displays  Her charms celestial born and purest rays  Which thence in streams like golden sunshine flow  And shed their light on minds like yours below  Fair Honour next in beauty and in grace  Shines in her turn and claims the second place  She fills the wellborn soul with noble fires  And generous thoughts and godlike acts inspires  Then Honesty with native air succeeds  Plain is her look unartful are her deeds  And just alike to friends and foes she draws  The bounds of right and wrong nor errs from equal laws  From heaven this scale of virtues thus descends  By just degrees and thy full choice defends  So when in

LADY To the Rev Dr BERKLEY Dean of  Londonderry  He was afterwards bishop of Cloyne  which he quits to go and settle a College at  Bermudas  DEAR doctor here comes a young virgin untainted  To your shrine at Bermudas to be married and sainted  I am young I am soft I am blooming and tender  And of all that I have I make you a surrender  My innocence led by the voice of your fame  To your person and virtue must put in its claim  And now I behold you I truly believe  That you're as like Adam as I am like Eve  But then as in you a new race has begun  Are teaching to fly from the shade to the sun  Before the dire serpent their virtue betray'd  And taught them to fly from the sun to the shade  For you in great goodness your friends are persuading  To go and to live and be wise in your Eden  Oh let me go with you oh pity my youth  Oh take me from hence let me not lose my truth  Sure you that have virtue so much in your mind  Can't think to leave me who am virtue behind  If you make me your wife sir in time you may fill a  Whole town with your children and likewise your villa  I famous for breeding you famous for knowledge  I'll found a whole nation you'll found a whole college  And

grass and corn it yields  All to your haggard brought so cheap in  Without the mowing or the reaping  A razor tho' to say't I'm loth  Would shave you and your meadows both  Tho' small's the farm yet here's a house  Full large to entertain a mouse  But where a rat is dreaded more  Than savage Caledonian boar  For if 'tis enter'd by a rat  There is no room to bring a cat  A little rivulet seems to steal  Down thro' a thing you call a vale  Like tears adown a wrinkled cheek  Or rain along a blade of leek  And this you call your sweet meander  Which might be suck'd up by a gander  Could he but force his nether bill  To scoop the channel of the rill  I'm sure you'd make a mighty clutter  Were it as big as city gutter  Next come I to your kitchen garden  Which one poor slug would fare but hard in  And round his garden is a walk  No longer than a taylor's chalk  Thus I compute what space is in it  A snail creeps round it in a minute  One lettuce makes a shift to squeeze  Up thro' a tust you call your trees  And once a year a single rose  Peeps from the bud but never blows  In vain you then expect its bloom  It cannot blow for want of room  In short in all your boasted seat  There's

 The pigeon stuff'd which Noah sent  To tell him where the waters went  A ring I've got of Sampson's hair  The same which Dalilah did wear  Saint Dunstan's tongs which story shews  Did pinch the devil

you delight in dance and song  For ever gay for ever young  But let not Biller's learned eye  O'erlook my feeble poetry  For London's fogs the muses choke  With seas of dirt and clouds of smoke  Not so at Bath where morning air  Breathes on the earlyrising fair  Where love once dipt his fiery darts  And with the waters warms our hearts  Where battledores beat tuneful time  And teach young poets how to rhime  Where snowy arms at once inspire  The flying cock and soft desire  Where happy walks and groves are free  From politicks and calumny  Nor sword nor hoop dares gives offence  Such was the

such nonsense and ly    By telling one Venus must always appear  In a car or a shell or a twinkling star  Drawn by sparrows or swans or by dolphins or doves  And attended in form by the Graces and Loves  That ambrosia and nectar is all she will taste  And her passport to hearts is a belt round her waist  Without all this bustle I saw the bright dame  For to supper last night to Poultney's she came  In a good warm sedan no fine open car  Two chairmen for doves and a flambeau her star  No nectar she drank no ambrosia she eat  Her cup was plain claret a chicken her meat  Nor wanted the cestus her bosom to grace  For Richmond for that night had lent her her face  On a COLLAR Presented for HAPPY GILL  By Mr HUGHES  THOU little favourite of the fair  When thou these golden bands shalt wear

Account of the  English Poets  IF all who e'er invok'd the tuneful nine  In Addison's majestic numbers shine  Why then should Pope ye bards ye criticks tell  Remain unsung who sings himself so well  Hear then great bard who can alike inspire  With Waller's softness or with Milton's fire  Whilst I the meanest of the muses' throng  To thy just praises tune th' advent'rous song  How am I fill'd with rapture and delight  When gods and mortals mix'd sustain the fight  Like Milton then tho' in more polish'd strains  Thy chariots rattle o'er the smoking plains  What tho' archangel 'gainst archangel arms  And highest Heaven resounds with dire alarms  Doth not the reader with like dread survey  The wounded gods repuls'd with foul dismay  But when some fair one guides your softer verse  Her charms her godlike features to rehearse  See how her eyes with quicker lightnings arm  And Waller's thoughts in smoother numbers charm  When fools provoke and dunces urge thy rage  Flecknoe improv'd bites keener in each page  Give o'er great bard your fruitless toil give o'er  For still king Tibbald scribbles as before  Poor Shakespeare suffers by his pen each day  While Grubstreet alleys own his lawful sway  Now turn my muse thy quick poetic eyes  And view gay scenes and op'ning prospects rise  Hark how his rustic numbers charm around  While groves to groves and hills to hills resound  The list'ning beasts stand fearless as he sings  And birds attentive close their useless wings  The swains and satyrs trip it o'er the plain  And think old Spenser is reviv'd again  But when once more the godlike man begun  In words smooth flowing from his tuneful tongue  Ravish'd they gaze and struck with wonder say  Sure Spenser's self ne'er sung so sweet a lay  Sure once again Eliza glads the isle  That the kind muses thus propitious smile  Why gaze ye thus Why all this wonder swains  'Tis Pope that sings and Carolina reigns  But hold my muse whose aukward verse betrays  Thy want of skill nor shews the poet's praise  Cease then and leave some fitter bard to tell  How Pope in ev'ry strain can write in ev'ry strain excell  The TwentyFirst ODE of the Third Book of HORACE translated  By Lord MIDDLESEX  O nate mecum c  O HAPPY cask coaeval with thy Lord  One year to both did equal life afford  What tho' your hidden pow'r alike can move  To quarrel furious or more furious love  Can call brisk puns bid quaint conundrums rise  Or cast a heavy slumber o'er the eyes  O now descend Corvinus bids descend  For him your best your choicest liquor lend  Let him with rules of Socrates be wise  Fear not he'll ne'er your gen'rous juice despise  For well he knows that Cato's self with wine  Oft made his rigid virtues brighter shine  You with soft violence or mirth can wrest  The deepest secrets from the closest breast  By you inspir'd the anxious mind's reliev'd  Thinks but of mirth and wonders why it griev'd  By thee the poor in all their rags grown bold  Unaw'd the pomp of majesty behold  Hear unconcern'd shrill trumpets from afar  Nor dread the thunder of approaching war  Bacchus to whom bright liquor owes its birth  If Venus smiles propitious on our mirth  For you Corvinus will prolong our joy  For how can Bacchus join'd with Venus cloy  Till yon bright tapers cast a fainter light  Till Phoebus rising o'er the mountains bright  Chases the friendly darkness of the night  Upon a GOOSE  By Lord MIDDLESEX  NOW the full barns with yellow sheaves are stor'd  That yield a double product to their Lord  To glean the fields the Geese direct their way  And far from hence through unknown stubbles stray  The jolly farmer views with joyful eyes  The sacred light of Michael's dawn arise  While newshorn vales a pleasant prospect yield  And Geese unnumber'd whiten all the field  Obedient to his voice and wellknown call  A grateful victim to their saint they fall  Before his hospitable gate he stands  And welcomes in his guest with greeting hands  And now the neat though homely cloth display'd  And earthern plates in shining order laid  Provoke each hungry guest The Goose appears  The reeking load a bending servant bears  With sage well stuff'd to add a sav'ry taste  And sugar'd apples crown the rich repast  Brimful with ale the nutbrown bowls go round  While every voice of Geese the praises sound  The gods themselves might envy such a feast  And thund'ring Jove might wish to prove a guest  And thus O sacred bird each coming year  You keep the strictest bands of friends sincere  Oh could I sing your farresounding praise  In Prior's smooth or Pope's sublimer lays  Then should the Mantuan Swan exult no more  Nor higher than the British Goose should soar  Thy glory should the plains and vallies fill  While muses could inspire or Geese afford a quill  On Lady A  YOUNG thoughtless gay unfortunately fair  Her pride to please and pleasureall her care  With too much kindness and too little art  Prone to indulge the dictates of the heart  Flatter'd by all solicited admir'd  By women envied and by men desir'd  At once from full prosperity she's torn  By friends deserted of defence forlorn  Expos'd to talkers insults want and scorn  By ev'ry idle tongue her story told  The novel of the young the lecture of the old  But let the scoffer or the prude relate  With rigour's utmost force her hapless fate  Goodnature still to soft compassion wrought  Shall weep her ruin while it owns her fault  For if her conduct in some steps betray'd  To virtue's rule too little rev'rence paid  Yet dying still she shew'd so dear her fame  She could survive her guilt but not her shame  Her honour dearer than her life she prov'd  And dearer far than both the man she lov'd  Dr WINTER's QUESTIONS to Dr CHENEY  TELL me from what fatheaded Scot

Death  Albi nostrorum sermonum candide judex  SINCEREST critick of my prose or rhime  Tell how thy pleasing Stowe employs thy time  Say Cobham what amuses thy retreat  Or schemes of war or stratagems of state  Dost thou recall to mind with joy or grief  Great Marlbrough's actions that immortal chief  Whose slightest trophies rais'd in each campaign  More than suffic'd to signalize a reign  Does thy remembrance rising warm thy heart  With glory past where thou thyself hadst part  Or dost thou grieve indignant now to see  The fruitless end of all that victory  To see the audacious foe so late subdu'd  Dispute the terms for which so long they su'd  As if Britannia now were sunk so low  To beg that peace she wonted to bestow  Far be that guilt Be never known that shame  That England should retract her rightful claim  Or ceasing to be dreaded and ador'd  Stain with the pen the lustre of her sword  Or dost thou give the winds afar to blow  Each vexing thought and heartdevouring woe  And fix thy mind alone on rural scenes  To turn the levell'd lawns to liquid plains  To raise the creeping rills from humble beds  And force the latent springs to lift their heads  On watry columns capitals to rear  That lift their flowing curls with upper air  Or dost thou weary grown these works neglect  No temples statues obelisks erect  But seek the morning breeze from fragrant meads  Or shun the noontide ray in wholesome shades  Or slowly walk alone the mazy wood  To meditate on all that's wise and good  For nature bountiful in thee has join'd  A person pleasing with a worthy mind  Not given thee form alone but means and art  To draw the eye and to allure the heart  Poor were the praise in fortune to excell  Yet want the way to use that fortune well  While thus adorn'd while thus with virtue crown'd  At home in peace abroad in arms renown'd  Graceful in form and winning in address  While well you think what aptly you express  With health with honour with a fair estate  A table free and elegantly neat  What can be added more to mortal bliss  What can he want who stands possess'd of this  What can the fondest wishing mother more  Of heaven attentive for her son implore  And yet a happiness remains unknown  Or to philosophy reveal'd alone  A precept which unpractis'd renders vain  Thy flowing hopes and pleasures turns to pain  Should hope or fear thy heart alternate tear  Or love or hate or rage or anxious care  Whatever passions may thy mind infest  Where is that mind which passions ne'er molest  Amidst the pangs of such intestine strife  Still think the present day thy last of life  Defer not till tomorrow to be wise  Tomorrow's sun to thee may never rise  Or should tomorrow chance to chear thy sight  With her enlivening and unlook'd for light  How grateful will appear her dawning rays  As favours unexpected doubly please  Who thus can think and who such thoughts pursues  Content may keep his life or calmly lose  All proof of this thou may'st thyself receive  When leisure from affairs will give thee leave  Come see thy friend retir'd without regret  Forgetting care or trying to forget  In easy contemplation soothing time  With morals much and now and then with rhime  Not so robust in body as in mind  And always undejected tho' declin'd  Not wond'ring at the world's new wicked ways  Compar'd with those of our forefathers' days  For virtue now is neither more nor less  And vice is only varied in her dress  Believe it men have ever been the same  And Ovid's Golden Age is but a dream  By Lady MARY WORTLEY MONTAGUE  To Lady IRWIN  This poem has been already printed in Dodsley's Collection and is here reprinted for the sake of the answer which never appeared before In the original copy of the former the fourth stanza is wanting which we may suppose to have been afterwards added by the authoress as in Lady Irwin's reply there is none that corresponds with it    WHY will Delia thus retire  And languish life away  While the sighing crowds admire  'Tis too soon for hartshorn tea  All these dismal looks and fretting  Cannot Damon's life restore  Long ago the worms have eat him  You can never see him more  Once again consult your toilet  In the glass your face review  So much reading soon will spoil it  And no spring your charms renew  I like you was born a woman  Well I know what vapours mean  The disease alas is common  Single we have all the spleen  All the morals that they tell us  Never cur'd the sorrow yet  Choose among the pretty fellows  One of humour youth and wit  Prithee hear him every morning  For at least an hour or two  Once again at night returning  I believe the dose will do  The ANSWER  By Lady IRWIN  THO' Delia oft retires  'Tis not from spleen or hate  No lovers she desires  Nor envies others' fate  Tho' her Damon's dead 'tis true  Yet he lives in Delia's heart  None a constancy can shew  Where a virtue has no part  Should she consult her toilet  Alas she'll quickly find  Her face there's nought can spoil it  So she'll improve her mind  If the morals that they tell us  Cannot cure us of despair  I believe the pretty fellows  Will bring us only double care  'Tis our interest then to shun 'em  Since their practice it is such  They who venture boldly on 'em  Often find one dose too much  An ELEGY on Mrs BOWES  Mrs Bowes was the first wife of Mr Bowes father to the present Lady Strathmore    By Lady M W MONTAGUE  HAIL happy bride for thou art truly blest  Three months of pleasure crown'd with endless rest  Merit like yours was heaven's peculiar care  You lov'dyet tasted happiness sincere  The sweets of love to you were only shewn  The sure succeeding bitter dregs unknown  You had not yet the fatal change deplor'd  The tender lover for th' imperious lord  Nor felt the pangs that jealous fondness brings  Nor wept the coldness from possession springs  Above your sex distinguish'd in your fate  You trusted yet experienc'd no deceit  Swift were your hours and wing'd with pleasure flew  No vain repentance gave a sigh to you  And if superior bliss heav'n can bestow  With fellow angels you enjoy it now  On Lady MARY WORTLEY MONTAGUE's VERSES on the Death of Mrs BOWES  CLOE her thoughts has so exprest  Each chosen word so justly put  And yet how neat soe'er they're drest  We through the lawn may see the smut  Such lechery drest up so clean  And with so chaste a look  Is hardly to be felt or seen  But under Cloe's s  ck  The ANSWER to Lady MARY's VERSES on Mrs BOWES  THO' every one knows  The fate of poor Bowes  Yet doctors about it do vary  Some make a sad face  And pity her case  'Tis the envy of good Lady Mary  She says she don't know  How heaven can bestow  Any joy like the death of that bride  Whence some people say  Could she choose her own way  Before now she had certainly dy'd  But here lies the mistake  If her sense she would speak  Her meaning appears but too plain  She would always be trying  But to Bowes leaves the dying  Her choice is to live in the pain  On a LADY mistaking a DYING TRADER for a DYING LOVER  By Lady MARY WORTLEY MONTAGUE  on Mrs LOWTHER Lord LONSDALE's Sister  AS Chloris on her downy pillow lay  'Twixt sleep and wake the morning slid away  Soft at her chamber door a tap was heard  She listen'd and again no one appear'd  Who's there the sprightly nymph with courage cries  Madam 'tis one who for your la'ship dyes  Sure 'tis delusion what a dying Lover  Yet speak once more what is't you say discover  A second time these accents pierc'd the air  Sweet was the sound transported was the fair  At length mankind are just her la'ship said  Threw on her gown and stepping out of bed  Look'd in her glass confess'd him to be right  Who thinks me not a beauty 'tis meer spite  Assemble ye coquets with envy frown  To see the wonders that my eyes have done  In vain your pert and forward airs you try  Mankind the more you court the farther fly  And 'tis for me and only me they die  But how shall I receive him cry'd the dame  Prudence allows not pityI must blame  Perhaps poor soul he has sigh'd in secret long  Ere the presumptuous thought escap'd his tongue  I am the cause yet innocent by Heaven  Why were these eyes for such destruction given  'Tis not my fault I did not make one feature  Then turn'd her look to view the  dying creature  Butah who should the enamour'd swain now prove  A wretch who  dyes  by  Trade  and not by  Love  No mortal pen can figure her surprize  Willing to trust her ears but not her eyes  Th' approaching storm her swelling bosom show'd  Awhile now pale then red with anger glow'd  She wept she rav'd invok'd the pow'rs above  Who give no ear when old maids talk of love  Fruitless her pray'rs and impotent her rage  Yet sierce as when two female scolds engage  At length the fire was spent all was serene  A calm succeeded this tempestuous scene  And thus she spoke  Ye blooming maids let my example prove  How oft your sex mistaken are in love  When young we're cruel and with beauty play  Which while we vainly parley fades away  When old to encrease the rigour of our fate  We wish and talk of lovers when too late  As idle travellers who've lost the day  And hope in night through shades to find the way  Forlorn they tread the thorny paths in vain  Not of themselves but their hard fate complain  So peevish maids when past their youthful bloom  On sad remains and fancy'd charms presume  Lonely they wander no companion find  Then rail and quarrel with all human kind  But let us to ourselves for once be just  And see our own decays and wrinkles first  Whene'er to melting sighs we lend an ear  Think youth and beauty make the men sincere  No other powers their stubborn hearts can move  Did ever virtue light the torch of love  From sad experience I this truth declare  I am now abandon'd though I once was fair  VIRTUE IN DANGER A lamentable STORY how a virtuous LADY had like to have been ravished by her Sister's Footman  To the Tune of the Children in the Wood  By Lady M W MONTAGUE  I  NOW ponder well ye ladies fair  These words that I shall write  I'll tell a tale shall make you stare  Of a poor lady's fright  II  She lay'd her down all in her bed  And soon began to snore  It never came into her head  To lock her chamber door  III  A  Arthur Grey  Footman of her sister dear  A sturdy Scot was he  Without a sense of godly fear  Bethought him wickedly  IV  Thought he this lady lies alone  I like her comely face  It would most gallantly be done  Her body to embrace  V  In order to this bold attempt  He ran up stairs apace  While this poor lady nothing dreamt  Or dreamt it was his Grace  VI  The candle flaring in her eyes  Made her full soon awake  He scorn'd to do it by surprize  Or her a sleeping take  VII  A sword he had and it hard by  A thing appear'd withal  Which we for very modesty  A pistol chuse to call  VIII  This pistol in one hand he took  And thus began to woo her  Lord how this tender creature shook  When he presented to her  IX  Lady quoth he I must obtain  For I have lov'd you long  Would you know how my heart you gain'd  You had it for a song  X  Resolve to quench my present flame  Or you must murder'd be  It was those pretty eyes fair dame  That first have murder'd me  XI  The lady look'd with fear around  As in her bed she lay  And tho' halfdying in a swound  Thus to herself did say  XII  Who rashly judge it is a rule  Do often judge amiss  I thought this fellow was a fool  But there's some sense in this  XIII  She then recover'd heart of grace  And did to him reply  Sure Arthur you've forgot your place  Or know not that 'tis I  XIV  Do you consider who it is  That you thus rudely treat  'Tis not for scoundrel scrubs to wish  To taste their master's meat  XV  Tut tut quoth he I do not care  And so pull'd down the clothes  Uncover'd lay the lady fair  From bosom down to toes  XVI  Oh Arthur cover me she said  Or sure I shall get cold  Which presently the rogue obey'd  He could not hear her scold  XVII  He lay'd his sword close by her side  Her heart went pitapat  You've but one weapon left she cry'd  Sure I can deal with that  XVIII  She saw the looby frighted stand  Out of the bed jumpt she  Catch'd hold of his so furious hand  A fight it was to see  XIX  His pistol hand she held fast clos'd  As she remembers well  But how the other was dispos'd  There's none alive can tell  XX  The sword full to his heart she laid  But yet him did not slay  For when he saw the shining blade  God wot he run away  XXI  When she was sure the knave was gone  Out of her father's hall  This vertuous lady strait begun  Most grievously to bawl  XXII  In came papa and mamma dear  Who wonder'd to behold  Out Grisle what a noise is here  Why stand you in the cold  XXIII  Mamma she said and then she wept  I have a battle won  But if that I had soundly slept  My honour had been gone  XXIV  A footman of my sister he  A footman cry'd mamma  Dear daughter this must never be  Z  ds we must go to law  XXV  This lady's fame shall ever last  And live in British song  For she was like Lucretia chaste  And eke was much more strong  Epistle from ARTHUR GREY the Footman after his Condemnation for attempting a RAPE  This animated poem is omitted in the latter editions of Mr Dodsley's collection and is therefore reprinted here    By the RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGUE  READ lovely nymph and tremble not to read  I have no more to wish nor you to dread  I ask not life for life to me were vain  And death a refuge from severer pain  My only hope in these last lines I try  I would be pity'd and I then would die  Long had I liv'd as sordid as my fate  Nor curs'd the destiny that made me wait  A sordid slave content with homely food  The gross instinct of appetite pursu'd  Youth gave me sleep at night and warmth of blood  Ambition yet had never touch'd my breast  My lordly master knew no sounder rest  With labour healthy in obedience blest  But when I sawOh had I never seen  That wounding softness that engaging mien  The mist or wretched education flies  Shame fear desire despair and love arise  The new creation of those beauteous eyes  But yet that love pursu'd no guilty aim  Deep in my heart I hid the secret flame  I never hop'd my fond desire to tell  And all my wishes wereto serve you well  Heav'ns how I flew when wing'd by your command  And kiss'd the letters giv'n me by your hand  How pleas'd how proud how fond was I to wait  Present the sparkling glass or change the plate  How when you sung my soul devour'd the sound  And every sense was in the rapture drown'd  Tho' bid to go I quite forgot to move  You knew not that  stupidity was love  But oh the torment not to be express'd  The grief the rage the hell that fir'd this breast  When my great rivals in embroidry gay  Sat by your side or led you from the play  I still  contriv'd near as I could to stand  The flambeau trembling in my careless hand  I saw or thought I saw those fingers press'd  For thus their passion by my own I guess'd  And jealous fury all my soul possess'd  Like torrents love and indignation meet  And madness would have thrown me at your feet  Turn lovely nymph for so I would have said  Turn from those triflers who make love a trade  This is true passion in my eyes you see  They cannot nothey cannot love like me  Frequent debauch has pall'd their sickly taste  Faint their desire and in a moment past  They sigh not from the heart but from the brain  Vapours of vanity and more champagne  Too dull to feel what forms like yours inspire  After long talking of their painted fire  To some lewd brothel they at night retire  There pleas'd with fancy'd quality and charms  Enjoy your beauties in a strumpet's arms  Such are the joys those toasters have in view  And such the wit and pleasure they pursue  And is this love that ought to merit you  Each Opera night a new address begun  They swear to thousands what they swear to one  Not thus I sighbut all my sighs are vain  Die wretched Arthur and conceal thy pain  'Tis impudence to wish and madness to complain  Fix'd on this view my only hope of ease  I waited not the aid of slow disease  The keenest instruments of death I sought  And death alone employ'd my lab'ring thought  Thus all the nightwhen I remember well  The charming tinkle of your morning bell  Fir'd by the sound I hasten'd with your tea  With one last look to smooth the darksome way  But oh how dear that fatal look cost  In that fond moment my resolves were lost  Hence all my guilt and all my sorrows rise  I saw the languid softness of your eyes  I saw the dear disorder of your bed  Your cheeks all glowing with a tempting red  Your nightclothes tumbled with resistless grace  Your flowing hair play'd careless round your face  Your nightgown fasten'd with a single pin  Fancy improv'd the wondrous charms within  I fix'd my eyes upon that heaving breast  And hardly hardly I forebore the rest  Eager to gaze unsatisfy'd with sight  My head grew giddy with the near delight  Too well you know the fatal following night  Th' extremest proof of my desire I give  And since you will not love I will not live  Condemn'd by you I wait the righteous doom  Careless and fearless of the woes to come  But when you see me waver in the wind  My guilty flame extinct my soul resign'd  Sure you may pity what you can't approve  The cruel consequence of furious love  Think the bold wretch who could so greatly dare  Was tender faithful ardent and sincere  Think when I held the pistol to your breast  Had I been of the world's large rule possess'd  That would have then been yours and I been blest  Think that my life was quite below my care  Nor fear'd I any hell beyond despair  If these reflections tho' they seize you late  Give some compassion for your Arthur's fate  Enough you give nor ought I to complain  You pay my pangs nor have I dy'd in vain  Mr JOHN PHILIPS's designed Dedication to his Poem called THE SPLENDID SHILLING  To W BROME Esq of  Ewithington  in the County of  Hereford  SIR  IT would be too tedious an undertaking at this time to examine the rise and progress of Dedications The use of them is certainly ancient as appears both from Greek and Latin authors and we have reason to believe that it was continued without any interruption till the beginning of this century at which time mottos anagrams and frontispieces being introduced Dedications were mightily discouraged and at last abdicated But to discover precisely when they were restored and by whom they were first usher'd in is a work that far transcends my knowledge a work that can justly be expected from no other pen but that of your operose Doctor Bentley Let us therefore at present acquiesce in the dubiousness of their antiquity and think the authority of the past and present times a  sufficient plea for your patronizing and my dedicating this poem Especially since in this age Dedications are not only fashionable but almost necessary and indeed they are now so much in vogue that a book without one is as seldom seen as a bawdyhouse without a Practice of Piety or a poet with money Upon this account Sir those who have no friends dedicate to all good christians some to their booksellers some for want of a sublunary patron to the manes of a departed one There are that have dedicated to their whores God help those henpeck'd writers that have been forced to dedicate to their own wives but while I talk so much of other mens patrons I have forgot my own and seem rather to make an essay on Dedications than to write one However Sir I presume you will pardon me for that fault and perhaps like me the better for saying nothing to the purpose You Sir are a person more tender of other mens reputation than your own and would hear every body commended but yourself Should I but mention your skill in turning and the compassion you shew'd to my fingers ends when you  gave me a tobacco stopper you would blush and be confounded with your just praises How much more would you should I tell you what a progress you have made in that abstruse and useful language the Saxon Since therefore the recital of your excellencies would prove so troublesome I shall offend your modesty no longer Give me leave to speak a word or two concerning the poem and I have done This poem Sir if we consider the moral the newness of the subject the variety of images and the exactness of the similitudes that compose it must be allowed a piece that was never equalled by the moderns or ancients The subject of the poem is myself a subject never yet handled by any poets How it to be handled by all we may learn by those few divine commendatory verses written by the admirable Monsieur le Bog Yet since I am the subject and the poet too I shall say no more of it lest I should seem vainglorious As for the moral I have took particular care that it should lie incognito not like the ancients who let you know at first sight they design something by their verses But  here you may look a good while and perhaps after all find that the poet has no aim or design which must needs be a diverting surprize to the reader What shall I say of the similes that are so full of geography that you must get a Welshman to understand them that so raise our ideas of the things they are apply'd to that are so extraordinarily quaint and well chosen that there's nothing like them So that I think I may without vanity say  Avia Pieridum peragro loca    c  Yet however excellent this poem is in the reading of it you will find a vast difference between some parts and others which proceeds not from your humble servant's negligence but diet This poem was begun when he had little victuals and no moneys and was finished when he had the misfortune at a virtuous lady's house to meet with both But I hope in time Sir when hunger and poverty shall once more be my companions to make amends for the defaults of this poem by an essay on Minced Pies which shall be devoted to you with all submission by  SIR  Your most obliged And humble servant J PHILIPS  Copy of a Letter from Mr PITT the Translator of VIRGIL  To Mr SPENCE  July Blanford  DEAR Jo  I Am entering into proposals with a bookseller for printing a little miscellany of my own performances consisting of some originals and select Translations I beg you to be altogether silent in the matter Mr Pope has used so little of the d Odyssey that I gave Dr Younge that if I put it in among the rest I shall hardly incur any danger of the penalty concerning the patent However I will not presume to publish a single line of it after Mr Pope's Translation if you advise me as I desire you to do sincerely to the contrary I shall send you a small specimen of my Translation which if you approve of I can assure you the remainder of the book is not inferior to it  THE nurse all wild with transport seem'd to swim  Joy wing'd her feet and lighten'd ev'ry limb  Then to the room with speed impatient born  Flew with the tidings of her lord's return  There bending o'er the sleeping Queen she cries  Rise my Penelope my daughter rise  To see Ulysses thy long absent spouse  Thy soul's desire and lord of all thy vows  Tho' late he comes and in his rage has slain  For all their wrongs the haughty suitor train  Ah Euryelea she replies you rave  The gods resume that reason which they gave  For Heav'n deep wisdom to the fool supplies  But oft infatuates and confounds the wise  And wisdom once was thine but now I find  The gods have ruin'd thy distemper'd mind  How could you hope your fiction to impose  Was it to flatter or deride my woes  How could you break a sleep with talk so vain  That held my sorrows in so soft a chain  A sleep so sweet I never could enjoy  Since my dear lord left Ithaca for Troy  Curst Troyoh why did I thy name disclose  Thy fatal name awakens all my woes  But flysome other had provok'd my rage  And you but owe your pardon to your age  No artful tales no studied lies I frame  Ulysses lives rejoins the rev'rend dame  In that dishonour'd stranger's close disguise  Long has he past all unsuspecting eyes  All but thy son'sand long has he supprest  The wellconcerted secret in his breast  Till his brave father should his foes defeat  And the close scheme of his revenge compleat  Swift as the word the Queen transported sprung  And round the dame in strict embraces hung  Then as the big round tears began to roll  Spoke the quick doubts and hurry of her soul  If my victorious hero safe arrives  If my dear lord Ulysses still survives  Tell me oh tell me how he fought alone  How were such multitudes destroy'd by one  Nought I beheld but heard their cries she said  When death flew raging and the suitors bled  Immur'd we listen'd as we fat around  To each deep groan and agonizing sound  Call'd by thy son to view the scene I fled  And saw Ulysses striding o'er the dead  Amidst the rising heaps the hero stood  All grim and terribly adorn'd with blood  This is enough in conscience for this time besides I am desired by Mr Pope or Mr Lintot I don't know which to write to Mr Pope on a certain affair  Original Letter from Mr GEORGE VERTUE  This letter from Mr George Vertue and the other from Prior and Elkanah Settle have no immediate relation to Mr Pope's correspondence but were found in the same Repository    To Mr CHARLES CHRISTIAN  MR CHRISTIAN  PRAY inform my Lord Harley that I have on Thursday last seen the daughter of Milton the poet I carry'd with me two or three different  prints of Milton's picture which she immediately knew to be like her father and told me her motherinlaw if living in Cheshire had two pictures of him one when he was a school boy and the other when he was about twenty She knows of no other picture of him because she was several years in Ireland both before and after his death She was the youngest of Milton's daughters by his first wife and was taught to read to her father several languages  Mr Addison was desirous to see her once and desired she would bring with her testimonials of being Milton's daughter but as soon as she came into the room he told her she needed none her face having much of the likeness of the pictures he had seen of him  For my part I find the features of her face very much like the prints I showed her the painting I have to engrave which she believes not to be her father's picture it being of a brown complexion and black hair and curled locks On the contrary he was of a fair complexion a little red in his cheeks and light brown lank hair  I desire you would acquaint Mr Prior I was so unfortunate to wait on him on Thursday morning last just after he was gone out of town It was with the intent to enquire of him if he remembers a picture of Milton in the late Lord Dorset's collection as I am told this was or if he can inform me how I shall enquire or know the truth of this affair I should be much obliged to him being very willing to have all the certainty on that account before I begin to engrave the plate that it may be the more satisfactory to the publick as well as to myself  The sooner you communicate this the better because I want to resolve which I can't do till I have an answer which will much oblige  Your friend to command GEO VERTUE  Saturday Aug  Mr PRIOR to Mr WANLEY  MY GOOD AND KIND WANLEY  I Send you these sheets as look'd over first by Mr Bedford and then by myself I have made great letters at  ye    me  and emphatical words that this may answer to the tenor of

 Your Lordship's most dutiful servant E SETTLE  LETTERS by Mr POPE  To a LADY  Twitenham  October  MADAM  WE are indebted to Heaven for all things and above all for our sense and genius in whatever degree we have it but to fancy yourself indebted to any thing else moves my anger at your modesty The regard I must bear you seriously proceeds from myself alone and I will not suffer even one I like so much as Mrs H to have a share in causing it I challenge a kind of relation to you on the  soul's  side which I take to be better than either on a father's or mother's and if you can overlook an ugly  body  that stands much in the way of any friendship when it is between different sexes I shall hope to find you a true and constant kinswoman in Apollo Not that I would place all my pretensions upon that poetical foot much less confine them to it I am far more desirous to be admitted  as yours on the more meritorious title of friendship I have ever believed this as a sacred maxim that the most ingenious natures were the most sincere and the most knowing and sensible minds made the best friends Of all those that I have thought it the felicity of my life to know I have ever found the most distinguished in capacity the most distinguished in morality and those the most to be depended on whom one esteemed so much as to desire they should be so I beg you to make me no more compliments I could make you a great many but I know you neither need them nor can like them be so good as to think I do not In one word your writings are very good and very entertaining but not so good nor so entertaining as your life and conversation One is but the effect and emanation of the other It will always be a greater pleasure to me to know you are well than that you write well though every time you tell me the one I must know the other I am willing to spare your modesty and therefore as to your writing may perhaps never say more directly to yourself than the few verses I send here which as a  proof of my own modesty too I made so long ago as the day you sate for your picture and yet never till now durst confess to you  Tho' sprightly Sappho force our love and praise  A softer wonder my pleas'd soul surveys  The mild Erinna blushing in her bays  So while the sun's broad beam yet strikes the sight  All mild appears the moon's more sober light  Serene in virgin majesty she shines  And unobserv'd the glaring sun declines  The brightest wit in the world without the better qualities of the heart must meet with this fate and tends only to endear such a character as I take yours to be In the better discovery and fuller conviction of which I have a strong opinion I shall grow more and more happy the longer I live your acquaintance and if you will indulge me in so much pleasure  Your faithful friend And most obliged servant A POPE  To the same  Twitenham  Nov  MADAM  THOUGH I am extremely obliged by your agreeable letter I will avoid all mention of the pleasure you give me that we may have no more words about compliments which I have often observed people talk themselves into while they endeavour to talk themselves out of It is not more the diet of friendship and esteem than a few thin wafers and marmalade were of so hearty a stomach as Sancho's In a word I am very proud of my new relation and like Parnassus much the better since I found I had so good a neighbour there Mrs H  who lives at court shall teach two countryfolks sincerity and when I am so happy as to meet you she shall settle the proportions of that regard or goodnature which she can allow you to spare me from a heart which is so much her own as yours is  That lady is the most trusty of friends if the imitation of Shakespear be yours for she made me  give my opinion of it with assurance it was none of Mrs  I honestly liked and praised it whosesoever it was there is in it a sensible melancholy and too true a picture of human life so true an one that I can scarce wish the verses yours at the expence of your thinking that way so early I rather wish you may love the town which the author of those lines cannot  immoderately  do these many years It is time enough to like or affect to like the country when one is out of love with all but one'sself and therefore studies to become agreeable or easy to one'sself Retiring into one'sself is generally the  pisaller  of mankind Would you have me describe my solitude and grotto to you What if after a long and painted description of them in verse which the writer I have just been speaking of could better make if I can guess by that line  No noise but water ever friend to thought  what if it ended thus  What are the falling rills the pendant shades  The morning bow'rs the evening colonnades  But soft recesses for th' uneasy mind  To sigh unheard in to the passing wind  So the struck deer in some sequester'd part  Lies down to die the arrow in his heart  There hid in shades and wasting day by day  Inly he bleeds and pants his soul away  If these lines want poetry they do not want sense God Almighty long preserve you from a feeling of them The book you mention Bruyere's Characters will make any one know the world and I believe at the same time despise it which is a sign it will make one know it thoroughly It is certainly the proof of a masterhand that can give such striking likenesses in such slight sketches and in so sew strokes on each subject In answer to your question about Shakespear the book is about a quarter printed and the number of emendations very great I have never indulged my own conjectures but kept meerly to such amendments as are authorized by old editions in the author's lifetime but I think it will be a year at least before the whole work can be finished In reply to your very handsome I wish it were a very  true compliment upon this head I only desire you to observe by what natural gentle degrees I have sunk to the humble thing I now am first from a pretending poet to a critick then to a low translator lastly to a meer publisher I am apprehensive I shall be nothing that's of any value long except  MADAM  Your most obliged and Most faithful humble servant A POPE  I long for your return to town a place I am unfit for but shall not be long out of as soon as I know I may be permitted to wait on you there  To the same  Thursday night  MADAM  IT was an agreeable surprize to me to hear of your settlement in town I lie at my Lord Peterborow's in Boltonstreet where any commands of yours will reach me tomorrow only on Saturday evening I am preengaged If Mrs H  be to be engaged and if she is by any creature it is by you I hope she will join us I am with great truth  MADAM  Your most faithful friend And obliged servant A POPE  To the same  MADAM  I Could not play the impertinent so far as to write to you till I was encouraged to it by a piece of news Mrs H  tells me which ought to be the most agreeable in the world to any author That you are determined to write no moreIt is now the time then not for me only but for every body to write without fear or wit and I shall give you the first example here But for this assurance it would be every way too dangerous to correspond with a lady whose very first sight and very first writings had such an effect upon a man used to what they call fine sights and what they call fine writings Yet he has been dull enough to sleep quietly after all he has seen and all he has read till yours broke in upon his stupidity and indolence and totally destroyed it But God be thanked you will write no more so I am in no danger of increasing my admiration of you one way and as to the other you will never I have too much reason to fear open these eyes again with one glimpse of you  I am told you named lately in a letter a place called Twitenham with particular distinction That you may not be misconstrued and have your meaning mistaken for the future I must acquaint you Madam that the name of the place where Mrs H  is is not Twitenham but Richmond which your ignorance in the geography of these parts has made you confound together You will unthinkingly do honour to a paltry hermitage while you speak of Twitenham where lives a creature altogether unworthy your memory or notice because he really wishes he had never beheld you nor yours You have spoiled him for a solitaire and a book all the days of his life and put him into such a condition that he thinks of nothing and enquires of nothing but after a person who has nothing to say to him and has left him for ever without hope of ever again regarding or pleasing or entertaining him much less of seeing him He has been so mad with the idea of her as to steal her picture and passes whole days in sitting before it talking to himself and as some people imagine making verses  but it is no such matter for as long as he can get any of hers he can never turn his head to his own it is so much better entertained  To the same  MADAM  I Am touched with shame when I look on the date of your letter I have answered it a hundred times in my own mind which I assure you has few thoughts either so frequent or so lively as those relating to you I am sensibly obliged by you in the comfort you endeavour to give me upon the loss of a friend It is like the shower we have had this morning that just makes the drooping trees hold up their heads but they remain checked and withered at the root the benediction is but a short relief though it comes from Heaven itself The loss of a friend is the loss of life after that is gone from us it is all but a gentler decay and wasting and lingering a little longer I was the other day  forming a wish for a lady's happiness upon her birthday and thinking of the greatest climax of felicity I could raise step by step to end in thisa Friend I fancy I have succeeded in the gradation and send you the whole copy to ask your opinion or which is much the better reason to desire you to alter it to your own wish for I believe you are a woman that can wish for yourself more reasonably than I can for you Mrs H  made me promise her a copy and to the end she may value it I beg it may be transcribed and sent her by you  To a LADY on her BIRTHDAY  Oh be thou blest with all that Heaven can send  Long life long youth long pleasureand a friend  Not with those toys the womanworld admire  Riches that vex and vanities that tire  Let joy or ease let affluence or content  And the gay conscience of a life wellspent  Calm every thought inspirit every grace  Glow in thy heart and smile upon thy face  Let day improve on day and year on year  Without a pain a trouble or a fear  And ah since death must that dear frame destroy  Die by some sudden extasy of joy  In some soft dream may thy mild soul remove  And be thy latest gasp a sigh of love  Pray Madam let me see this mended in your copy to Mrs H  and let it be an exact scheme of happiness drawn and I hope enjoyed by yourself To whom I assure you I wish it all as much as you wish it her I am always with true respect  MADAM  Your most faithful friend And most humble servant A POPE  To the same  Twitenham  August  MADAM  YOUR last letter tells me that if I do not write in less than a month you will fancy the length of yours frighted me A consciousness that I had upon me of omitting too long to answer it made me look not without some fear and trembling for the date of it but there happened to be none and I hope either that you have forgot how long it is or at least that you cannot think it so long as I do since I writ to you Indeed a multitude of things which singly seem trifles and yet all together make a vast deal of business and wholly take up that time which we ought to value above all such things have from day to day made me wanting as well to my own greatest pleasure in this as to my own greatest concerns in other points If I seem to neglect any friend I have I do more than seem to neglect myself as I find daily by the increasing ill constitution of my body and mind I still resolve this course shall not nay I see it cannot be long  and I determine to retreat within myself to the only business I was born for and which I am only good for if I am entitled to use that phrase for any thing It is great folly to sacrifice one's self one's time one's quiet the very life of life itself to forms complaisances and amusements which do not inwardly please me and only please a sort of people who regard me no farther than a meer instrument of their present idleness or vanity To say truth the lives of those we call great and happy are divided between those two states and in each of them we poetical fiddlers make but part of their pleasure or of their equipage And the misery is we in our turns are so vain at least I have been so as to chuse to pipe without being paid and so silly to be pleased with piping to those who understand musick less than ourselves They have put me of late upon a task before I was aware which I am  sick  and  sore  of and yet engaged in honour to some persons whom I must neither disobey nor disappoint I mean two or three in the world only to go on with it They make me do as mean a thing as the greatest  man of them could do seem to depend and to solicit when I do not want and make a kind of court to those above my rank just as they do to those above theirs when we might much more wisely and agreeably live of ourselves and to ourselves You will easily find I am talking of my translating the Odyssey by subscription which looks it must needs look to all the world as a design of mine both upon fame and money when in truth I believe I shall get neither for one I go about without any stomach and the other I shall not go about at all  This freedom of opening my mind upon my own situation will be a proof of trust and of an opinion your goodness of nature has made me entertain that you never profess any degree of goodwill without being pretty warm in it So I tell you my grievances I hope in God you have none wherewith to make me any return of this kind I hope that was the only one which you communicated in your last about Mrs H  silence for which she wanted not reproaches from me and has since she says amply atoned for I saw a few lines of yours to her  which are more obliging to me than I could have imagined if you put  my welfare  into the small number of things which you heartily wish for a sensible person of either sex will never wish for many I ought to be a happier man than I ever yet deserved to be  Upon a review of your papers I have repented of some of the trivial alterations I had thought of which were very few I would rather keep them till I have the satisfaction to meet you in the winter which I must beg earnestly to do for hitherto methinks you are to me like a spirit of another world a being I admire but have no commerce with I cannot tell but I am writing to a Fairy who has left me some favours which I secretly enjoy and shall think it unlucky if not fatal to part with So pray do not expect your verses till farther acquaintance  To the same  Twitenham  Sept  MADAM  NO confidence is so great as that one receives from persons one knows  may be  believed and in things one is  willing  to believe I have at last acquired this by Mrs H  repeated assurances of a thing I am unfeignedly so desirous of as your allowing me to correspond with you In good earnest there is sometimes in men as well as in women a great deal of unaffected modesty and I was sincere all along when I told her personally and told you by my silence that I feared only to seem impertinent while perhaps I seemed negligent to you To tell Mrs  any thing like what I really thought of her would have looked so like the common traffick of compliment that pays only to receive and to have told it her in distant or bashful terms would have appeared so like coldness in my sense of good qualities which I cannot find out in any one without feeling from my nature at the same time a great warmth for them that I was quite at a loss  what to write or in what stile to you But I am resolved plainly to get over all objections and faithfully to assure you if you will help a bashful man to be past all preliminaries and forms I am ready to treat with you for your friendship I know without more ado you have a valuable soul and wit sense and worth enough to make me reckon it provided you will permit it one of the happinesses of my life to have been made acquainted with you  I do not know on the other hand what you can think of me but this for a beginning I will venture to engage that whoever takes me for a poet or a wit as they call it takes me for a creature of less value than I am and that whereever I profess it you shall find me a much better man that is a much better friend or at least a much less faulty one than I am a poet That whatever zeal I may have or whatever regard I may shew for things I truly am so pleased with as your entertaining writings yet I shall still have more for your person and for your health and for your happiness I  would with as much readiness play the apothecary or the nurse to mend your headakes as I would play the critick to improve your verses I have seriously looked over and over those you intrusted me with and assure you Madam I would as soon cheat in any other trust as in this I sincerely tell you I can mend them very little and only in trifles not worth writing about but will tell you every tittle when I have the happiness to see you  I am more concerned than you can reasonably believe for the ill state of health you are at present under but I will appeal to time to shew you how sincerely I am if I live long enough to prove myself what I truly am  MADAM  Your most faithful servant A POPE  I am very sick all the while I write this letter which I hope will be an excuse for its being so scribbled  To the same  Twitenham  Nov  MADAM  IT happened that when I determined to answer yours by the post that followed my receipt of it I was prevented from the first proof I have had the happiness to give you of my warmth and readiness in returning the epitaph with my sincere condolements with you on that melancholy subject But nevertheless I resolved to send you the one though unattended by the other I begged Mrs H  to inclose it that you might at least see I had not the power to delay a moment the doing what you bid me especially when the occasion of obeying your commands was such as must affect every admirer and wellwisher of honour and virtue in the nation  You had it in the very blots the better to compare the places and I can only say it was done to the best of my judgement and to the extent of my sincerity  I do not wonder that you decline the poetical amusement I proposed to you at this time I know from what little I know of your heart enough at least to convince me it must be too deeply concerned at the loss not only of so great and so near a relation but of a good man a loss this age can hardly ever afford to bear and not often can sustain Yet perhaps it is one of the best things that can be said of poetry that it helps us to pass over the toils and troubles of this tiresome journey our life as horses are encouraged and spirited up the better to bear their labour by the jingling of bells about their heads Indeed as to myself I have been used to this odd cordial so long that it has no effect upon me but you Madam are in your honeymoon of poetry you have seen only the smiles and enjoyed the caresses of Apollo Nothing is so pleasant to a Muse as the first children of the Imagination but when once she comes to find it meer conjugal duty and the care of her numerous progeny daily grows upon her it is all a sour tax for past pleasure As the Psalmist says on another occasion the age of a Muse is scarce above five and twenty  all the rest is labour and sorrow I find by experience that his own fiddle is no great pleasure to a common fiddler after once the first good conceit of himself is lost  I long at last to be acquainted with you and Mrs H  tells me you shall soon be in town and I blest with the vision I have so long desired Pray believe I worship you as much and send my addresses to you as often as to any female Saint in Heaven it is certain I see you as little unless it be in my sleep and that way too holy hermits are visited by the Saints themselves  I am without figures and metaphors yours and hope you will think I have spent all my fiction in my poetry so that I have nothing but plain truth left for my prose with which I am ever  MADAM  Your faithful humble servant  To the same  Five o'clock  MADAM  I Think it a full proof of that unlucky star which upon too many occasions I have experienced that this first this only day that I should have owned happy beyond expectation for I did not till yesterday hope to have seen you so soon I must be forced not to do it I am too sick indeed very ill to go out so far and lie on a bed at my doctor's house as a kind of force upon him to get me better with all haste  I am scarce able to see these few lines I write to wish you health and pleasure enough not to miss me today and myself patience to bear being absent from you as well as I can being ill  I am truly Your faithful servant A POPE  To the same  Jan  MADAM  AFTER a very long expectation and daily hopes of the satisfaction of seeing and conversing with you I am still deprived of it in a manner that is the most afflicting because it is occasioned by your illness and your misfortune I can bear my own I assure you much better and thus to find you lost to me at the time that I hoped to have regained you doubles the concern I should naturally feel in being deprived of any pleasure whatever  Mrs H  can best express to you the concern of a friend who esteems and pities for she has the liberty to express it in her actions and the satisfaction of attending on you in your indisposition  I wish sincerely your condition were not such as to debar me from telling you in person how truly I am yours I wish I could do you any little offices of friendship or give you any amusements or help you to what people in your present state most want better spirits If reading to you or writing to you  could contribute to entertain your hours or to raise you to a livelier relish of life how well should I think my time employed indeed I should and think it a much better end of my poor studies than all the vanities of fame or views of a character that way which engage most men of my fraternity  If you thoroughly knew the zeal with which I am your servant you would take some notice of the advice I would give you and suffer it to have a weight with you proportionable to the sincerity with which it is given  I beg you to do your utmost to call to you all the succours which your own good sense and natural reflexion can suggest to avoid a melancholy way of thinking and to throw up your spirits by intervals of moderate company not to let your distemper fix itself upon your mind at least though it will not entirely quit your body Do not indulge too much solitariness Though most company be not proper or supportable during your illness force yourself to enter into such as is good and reasonable where you may have your liberty and be under no restraint  Why will you not come to your friend Mrs H  since you are able to go out and since motion is certainly good for your health Why will you not make any little sets of such as you are easiest with to sit with you sometimes  Do not think I have any interested aim in this advice though I long to see you and to try to amuse you I would not for the world be considered as one that would ever require for my own gratification any thing that might be improper or hurtful to you  Pray let me know by our friend Mrs H  if there can be anything in my power to serve or to amuse you But use me so kindly as not to think ever of writing to me till you are so well as that I may see you and then it will be needless Do not even read this if it be the least trouble to your eyes or head  Believe me with great respect and the warmest good wishes for your speedy recovery  MADAM  Your most faithful And most humble servant A POPE  To the same  Twitenham  June  MADAM  IT was an inexpressible pleasure to me to see your letter as I assure you it had long been a great trouble to reflect on the melancholy reason of your silence and absence It was that only which hindered my writing not only again but often to you for fear your goodnature should have been prompted to oblige me too much at your own expence by answering Indeed I never expressed and never shall be able to express more concern and good wishes for you than I shall ever feel for one of your merit  I am sorry the moment you grow better to have you snatcht from those who I may say deserve the pleasure of seeing you in health for having so long lamented and felt your illness  Mrs H  I hope will find it not impossible to draw you to Richmond and if not I dare say will not be long out of Hertfordshire I want  nothing but the same happy pretence she has of a title through your friendship and the privilege of her sex to be there immediately I cannot but wonder you have not heard from her though I should wonder if any body else had for I am told by her family she has had much of the headake at Bath besides the excuse of a great giddiness occasioned naturally by the waters I writ to her at the first going and have not had a word from her and now you tell me the same thing I conclude she has been worse than I imagine I hear she returns on Wednesday when I shall have the satisfaction I doubt not to talk and hear a great deal of Mrs    I wish I could say any thing either to comfort you when ill or entertain you when well Though nothing could in the proper proportion of friendship more affect me than your condition I have not wanted other occasions of great melancholy of which the least is the loss of part of my fortune by a late Act of Parliament  I am at present in the afflicting circumstance of taking my last leave of one of the  Bishop Atterbury  truest friends I ever had and one of the greatest men in all polite learning as well as the most agreeable companion this nation ever had  I really do not love life so dearly or so weakly as to value it on any other score than for that portion of happiness which a friend only can bestow upon it or if I must want that myself for the pleasure which is next it of seeing deserving and virtuous people happy So that indeed I want comfort and the greatest I can receive from you at least unless I were so happy as to deserve what I never can will be to hear you grow better till you grow perfectly well perfectly easy and perfectly happy which no one more sincerely wishes than  MADAM  Your faithful and obliged Friend and servant A POPE  To the same  Twitenham  Sept  MADAM  IT would be a vanity in me to tell you why I trouble you so soon again I cannot imagine myself of the number of those correspondents whom you call favourite ones yet I know it is thought that industry may make a man what merit cannot and if an old maxim of my Lord Oxford's be true That in England if a man resolve to be any thing and constantly stick to it he may even a Lord Treasurer if so I say it shall not be want of resolution that shall hinder me from being a favourite In good earnest I am more ambitious of being so to you Madam than I ever was or ever shall be of being one to any Prince or which is more any Prince's minister in Christendom  I wish I could tell you any agreeable news of what your heart is concerned in but I have a sort of quarrel to Mrs H  for not loving herself so well as she does her friends for those she makes happy but not herself  There is an air of sadness about her which grieves me and which I have learnt by experience will increase upon an indolent I will not say an affected resignation to it It will do so in men and much more in women who have a natural softness that sinks them even when reason does not This I tell you in confidence and pray give our friend such hints as may put her out of humour with melancholy your censure or even your raillery may have more weight with her than mine a man cannot either so decently or so delicately take upon him to be a physician in these concealed distempers  You see Madam I proceed in trusting you with things that nearly concern me In my last letter I spoke but of a trifle myself in this I advance farther and speak of what touches me more a friend  This beautiful season will raise up so many rural images and descriptions in a poetical mind that I expect you and all such as you if there be any such at least all who are not downright dull translators  like your servant must necessarily be productive of verses  I lately saw a sketch this way on the bower of  The lines here alluded to are as follows  In Tempe's shades the living lyre was strung  And the first Pope immortal Phoebus sung  These happy shades where equal beauty reigns  Bold rising hills slant vales and farstretch'd plains  The grateful verdure of the waving woods  The soothing murmur of the falling floods  A nobler boast a higher glory yield  Than that which Phoebus stampt on Tempe's field  All that can charm the eye or please the ear  Says Harmony itself inhabits here  BEDINGTON I could wish you tried something in the descriptive way on any subject you please mixed with vision and moral like pieces of the old provenÃ§al poets which abound with fancy and are the most amusing scenes in nature There are three or four of this kind in Chaucer admirable "The Flower and the Leaf" every body has been delighted with  I have long had an inclination to tell a Fairy tale the more wild and exotic the better therefore a  vision  which is confined to no rules of probability will take in all the variety and luxuriancy of description you will provided there be an apparent moral to it I think one or two of the Persian Tales would give one hints for such an invention and perhaps if the scenes were taken from real places that are known in order to compliment particular gardens and buildings of a fine taste as I believe several of Chaucer's descriptions do though it is what nobody has observed it would add great beauty to the whole  I wish you found such an amusement pleasing to you if you did but at leisure form descriptions from objects in nature itself which struck you most livelily I would undertake to find a tale that should bring them all together which you will think an odd undertaking but in a piece of this fanciful and imaginary nature I am sure is practicable Excuse this long letter and think no man is more  Your faithful And obliged servant A POPE  â˜ž IN the Preface to an edition of Monsieur POUILLY DE CHAMPEAUX's Works very lately published is the Extract of a Letter from Lord BOLINGBROKE to that Gentleman The original and translation are inserted here The comment is left to the reader  It may be necessary to add That Monsieur POUILLY DE CHAMPEAUX is a writer much esteemed on account of the elegance and spirit of humanity that breathe throughout his literary productions The chief of these is his Theory of Agreeable Sensations As to his political powers they have never yet been celebrated by his countrymen in such a strain as to authorize the following compliment to him on the part of Lord BOLINGBROKE  EXTRACT  "ENFIN mon cher Pouilly dans cette foule d'hommes que j'ai pu connoitre et dont j'ai cherchÃ© Ã  Ã©tudier l'esprit et le charactÃ¨re je n'en ai vu que TROIS qui m'aient paru dignes qu'on leur confiÃ¢t le soin de gouverner des nations NÃ´tre amitiÃ© est trop etroite elle est ainsi que le diroit Montaigne trop libre et trop franche dans ses allures pour que je m'enveloppe avec vous  de cette fausse modestie dont il faut quelquefois se faire un bouclier contre l'envie Je vous dirai donc hardiment que ces trois hommes sont vous MOI et POPE"  TRANSLATION  "MY dear friend among the croud of men whom it may have fallen in my way to know and whose understandings and characters I have endeavoured to study I have not yet marked out above THREE that appeared to me worthy of being trusted with the care of governing nations Our friendship is too intimate and as Montaigne would perhaps choose to express himself too frank and free in its paces for me to need with you the wrapping myself up in that false modesty of which there is sometimes a necessity for making a shield against envy I shall then tell you boldly that these three men are YOU MYSELF and POPE"  END OF VOL I
