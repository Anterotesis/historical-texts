 THE LADY'S MUSEUM  BY THE Author of the FEMALE QUIXOTE  VOL II  LONDON Printed for J NEWBERY in St Paul's Churchyard and J COOTE in Paternoster Row  THE LADY'S MUSEUM  The TRIFLER NUMBER VI  MADAM  _I Take up my pen once more to give you the remainder of my sad story and am pleased to find that many of your female readers express a just abhorrence of the character of Belinda I feel my heart too much affected with the remembrance of the sorrows she occasioned me to enter into a detail of all her little artifices to ensnare the heart of my husband there was an endless variety in her temper which kept his attention perpetually awake and prevended all satiety and she had so perfect a command of her features that whatever disposition  she pleased to assume her countenance expressed it as naturally as if she really felt it  My husband grew every day more fond of the company of one who always presented a new face to him sometimes airy and sparkling sometimes tender and melancholy now haughty and imperious then softened into a gentle languishment While I was ignorant of her insidious design I diverted myself with her fantastic behaviour but Alcander now discovered such an extreme attachment to her that I began to grow uneasy I was afraid of examining into the nature of my own doubts and fears the suspicion that my Alcander was grown indifferent to me and loved another was something so new so strange so shocking to my heart that I rejected it with horror yet spite of myself I sought the melancholy conviction and found it in his looks his words and every circumstance of his behaviour  My first thought was to expostulate with him upon his change but my pride opposed this and reason told me that upbraidings would not recal his affections I resolved therefore to seem ignorant of my misfortune and flattering myself that when my dangerous guest had left me the impression she had made would be removed I patiently waited for her departure  When she told me of her intention to return to London in a day or two my heart bounded with joy and I scorned to dissemble so far as to desire her to stay any longer but what became of me when turning my eyes upon Alcander I saw him pale as death and unable to utter a word so greatly  was he affected with the thoughts of parting At length recovering himself he solicited her to stay some time longer with such beseeching looks and such earnestness of intreaty that finding myself unable to support this scene I rose up and complaining of a sudden indisposition retired to my chamber  My husband followed me immediately and I eager to admit every thought that could give me comfort considered this as an effect of his tenderness and concern for me but I was soon undeceived he came only to reprove me for my incivility to my guest in not pressing her to stay longer and he had the cruelty to desire I would use my undeavours to keep her with us  I answered nothing but burst into tears Alcander who doubtless knew the cause and dreaded an explanation left the room without taking any notice of my disorder Oh how unlike was this to his former behaviour I thought I should have died with grief but pride and resentment came to my aid I resolved not to add to Belinda's triumph by suffering my uneasiness to appear I therefore composed my looks and when she came with an affected solicitude to enquire after my health she found me in appearance easy and tranquil  My husband finding me fully determined not to hinder Belinda from leaving us declared his intention to go to London and coldly asked me if it would be agreeable to me I replied that I would certainly accompany him so we all set out together Belinda and I parted with great indifference  on both sides I dropt all intercourse with her and this put my husband into so bad a humour that he treated me with the most mortifying neglect  My father was dead my mother who loved me tenderly and was attentive to the behaviour of my husband soon perceived the estrangement of his affections In her bosom I poured out all my sorrows and regulated my conduct by her prudence she recommended to me patience and silence and above all conjured me to keep the fatal secret from my brother his temper was rash and impetuous he was extremely fond of me and every thing was to be dreaded from his resentment if my husband's injurious treatment ever came to his knowledge This however it was impossible to prevent my unhappy situation became generally known so open was Alcander in his neglect of me and his gallantries to Belinda  My brother expostulated with him upon his behaviour the event was what my mother and I had often apprehended they fought Alcander was wounded he was brought home in a chair in a very weak condition I swooned at the sight of him and when I recovered I found myself in my mother's arms she informed me my brother was not hurt and that Alcander's surgeons had assured her he was not in the least danger The horrors I had laboured under were relieved by this news but my peace was lost for ever I attended my husband constantly during his illness which was but of short continuance he received my cares with a coldness that pierced me to the  heart and when he was so far recovered as to be able to go into the country he gave me to understand that he would dispense with my company there  I was beginning to expostulate with him but he stopped my mouth by telling me with a determined air that he never could pardon me for having exposed him to the insult he had received from my brother that I had made it impossible for him to alter his conduct since the world would construe it into a base fear of my brother he concluded with advising me to go and reside with my mother and without waiting for my answer left me  I will not attempt to describe the various passions which tortured me by turns but fond as I still was of my faithless husband the indignation I felt for his unworthy usage of me helped to support my spirits and hindered me from yielding to the violence of my grief I put myself under my mother's protection and resigned myself quietly to my fate  My husband a few months afterwards went to Italy disgusted as I have heard with the behaviour of Belinda who to recover her reputation which this affair had greatly sullied sacrificed him to her mirth upon all occasions and made her contempt of him as public as his attachment to her had been Her triumph however was short she experienced the greatest misfortune that could happen to a woman who thought beauty the supremest good she was seized with the smallpox  which made such ravage in her face that she was hardly to be known her passion for admiration still remains though the power of exciting it is gone Hence arises her punishment and she who delighted in giving pain to others finds in herself a perpetual source of vexation I am  Madam  Your Obliged Humble Servant PERDITA  TO THE AUTHOR of the TRIFLER  MADAM  AS you confess that you are not superior to trifles will you accept of a trifling criticism which if honoured with a place in your Museum may for the future perhaps occasion a different manner of reading and acting one particular passage in Macbeth that hitherto has been generally if not always misunderstood and misapplied  In the sixth scene of the fourth act a messenger of some rank Rosse comes to let Macduff know that his castle has been surprised and his wife and children savagely slaughtered The young king of Scotland Malcolm who had been some time at the English court solliciting troops and assistance from Edward the Confessor undertakes to comfort his friend and subject Macduff who had attended him to England and was deeply involved in his cause Macduff for some moments remains thunderstruck and silent Malcolm by way of consolation says  What man ne'er pull your hat upon your brows Give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the o'er fraught heart and bids it break  Macduff pays no regard or attention to Malcolm but turning to Rosse says  My children too  Rosse replies  Wife children servants all that could be found  Macduff  And I must be from thence my wife killed too  Rosse  I've said  Macduff makes no immediate answer but enfolding his arms and hanging down his head in all the melancholy silence of inexpressible grief stands fixed like a statue on the farther side of the stage Malcolm endeavouring to awaken Macduff from this lethargy of woe approaches near to him and says  Be comforted let's make us medicines of our griefs revenge to cure this deadly grief  Macduff still remains motionless and unmoved but when he looks up and sees his royal friend Malcolm returned to Rosse on the other side of the stage he sighs deeply and in a low voice expresses himself thus  He has no children What all my pretty ones did you say all what all  The expression  He has no children  is supposed and understood to refer to Macbeth who having no children could not afford to Macduff an adequate revenge The supposition undoubtedly is natural In cases of injury the law of retaliation never fails to occur to our minds and to be the object of our passions but the fact is not true Macbeth had a son his name was Luthlac After the death of his father he was extremely troublesome to Malcolm he claimed the crown and though a very weak deficient young man he answered the intentions of a rebellious party consisting of such followers as had been attached to the late Macbeth They carried him to Scone and he was there saluted king The competition was short nor had it any very dangerous or extraordinary circumstances In less than three  months the usurper Luthlac was slain by Malcolm then and not till then ended the race of Macbeth  From hence it evidently appears that the sentence  He has no children  cannot refer to Macbeth At whom then is it pointed At Malcolm The heartstruck Macduff heard with patience the consolatory advice administred by his royal master but well knew and could not avoid expressing to himself that as Malcolm had no children he could little judge of that torrent of grief with which Macduff must naturally be overwhelmed at the loss of a wife and  all his pretty ones  Malcolm was not married he could not feel the throbs of a parent's heart or the anguish of an husband's love To him the sweet and inexpressible sensations of nuptial happiness were unknown he was ignorant of the decent pride the rising hopes the alluring prospects that occupy and swell alternately a father's breast Young and unexperienced he had not felt those thilling nerves of nature which are never strung but by virtuous love and parental palpitations The good natured Malcolm offered his advice unseasonably he broke prematurely in upon sorrow that must require time and reason to sink itself into the gulph of satiety The intention of Malcolm was kind to the highest degree The effect of that intention was exerted in too hasty and too improper a manner  for Malcolm had no children  This construction seems supported by a sentence which soon follows where Malcolm again comes to the friendly charge of consolation and says  Support it like a man I shall  says Macduff  but I must also feel it as a man  that is  I must feel it as an husband and as a parent  or to expatiate upon the thought Macduff in those few words means thus to express himself  I must in the relation of father and husband suffer the deepest sensations of grief that human nature can imbibe Not all the world can repair my loss By the cruel murder of my wife I am deprived for ever deprived of the best of all my friends Many are dear to me she was the dearest In my children I have lost the pride of my house the comforts of my age the engaging amusements of my domestic hours the future servants subjects and defenders of my king and country You must be a father and a husband Malcolm 'ere you can measure my grief for I cannot but remember  such things were that were most precious to me  According to this interpretation the actor must shew by some gesture some motion either of his head or hand that Malcolm is the person in his thoughts when he says  He has no children  After staying some time in the place where he was first struck motionless he is rouzed at once by indignation and crossing the stage says to Rosse  What all my pretty ones  In this view I think Shakespear displays his own character and reveals his own sentiments as a parent If the sentence had referred solely to Macbeth supposing he had no children it carries with it rage fury and revenge If to Malcolm it is the reflection of a wise considerate man who is thankful  to his friend for his advice but conscious that that advice is for the present to no purpose  Buchanan in his History of Scotland evidently proves that Macbeth had a son at the time when Macduff's wife and children were slain Shakespear the most exact of all dramatic historians could never intend that he should appear he had none The following quotation  Buchanan Book VII the reign of Malcolm III the eightysixth king of Scotland  will support me in my assertion  Whilst these things were transacted at Forfar they who remained of the faction of Macbeth carried his son Luthlac to Scone who was sirnamed Fatuus from his want of wit and there he was saluted king Malcolm assaulted him in the valley Bogian where he was slain three months after he had usurped the name of king out of respect to the kingly race his and his father's bodies were buried in the royal sepulchres in Ionia  I am  Madam  Your most obedient Humble Servant C D  THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED  IT was not long before Sophia had an account of Sir Charles's visit from her mother who forgetting the part she had acted before wrote her a letter full of invectives against her obstinacy and disobedience and bitter upbraidings of her folly for losing by her illtimed pride the heart of such a man as Sir Charles  She told her with a kind of exultation that he had utterly forgot her and repeated every circumstance of his behaviour while he was with her and every word he had spoke as all tending to shew his indifference but though this was done to mortify Sophia and make her repent of her precipitate departure yet her discernment and that facility which lovers have in flattering their own wishes pointed out to her many things in this minute relation which served rather to nourish hope than destroy it  Mrs Darnley added as the finishing stroke that Sir Charles looked pale and thin she attributed this alteration in his health to the efforts he had made  to banish her from his heart and thence inferred that a resolution which had cost him so much trouble to confirm would not be easily broke through and that she had no reason to expect he would ever desire to see her more  Sophia could not read this part of the letter without tears tears that flowed from tender sensibility accompanied with a sensation which was neither grief nor joy but composed of both that Sir Charles should resolve to forget her was indeed afflicting but that this resolution should cost him struggles so painful as to affect his health could not but raise her depressed hopes since it shewed the difficulty of the attempt and consequently that the success was doubtful  This letter gave so much employment to her thoughts that to be at liberty to indulge them she took her evening walk without soliciting the company of her beloved Dolly and wandered far into the wood attracted by those romantic shades which afford such soothing pleasure to a lovesick mind Here while she meditated on her mother's letter and read it over and over still seeking and still finding something new in it to engage her attention she heard the voices of some persons talking behind her and suddenly recollecting Dolly's adventure she began to be alarmed at the distance to which she had unwarily strayed and turned her steps hastily towards home  Mean time a sudden gust of wind blew off her hat and carried it several paces back she turned in order to recover it and saw it taken up by a genteel young man who on a nearer approach she  knew to be the lover of her young friend Pleased at this encounter she advanced to receive her hat from him which he gave her with a blushing grace awed by the dignity of her mein and that sparkling intelligence which beamed in her eyes and seemed to penetrate into his inmost soul for Sophia who was deeply interested for her innocent and unhappy friend considered him attentively and was desirous of entering into some conversation with him that she might be enabled to form a more exact judgment of his understanding and manners than she could from the accounts of the partial Dolly  While she was talking to him they were joined by an ancient gentlewoman who accosting Sophia told her in an affected style and formal accent that her nephew was very happy in having had an opportunity to do her this little piece of service  Sophia who saw an old woman apparently opprest with the infirmities of years drest in all the ridiculous foppery of the last age was so little pleased with her that she would have answered this compliment with great coldness had not the desire and hope of being serviceable to her friend made her conquer her growing disgust she therefore resolved to improve this opportunity of commencing an acquaintance with the aunt of young William and met her advances with her usual sweetness and affability so that the old woman was quite charmed with her and being very desirous to gain her good opinion and to shew her breeding of which she was extremely vain overwhelmed her with troublesome ceremony and to display her understanding  of which she was equally proud murdered so many hard words that her discourse was scarcely intelligible  Sophia would fain have drawn in the youth to partake of their conversation but his aunt's volubility left him very little to say yet in that little Sophia thought she discovered both good sense and politeness  The evening being now pretty far advanced Sophia thought it time to separate and took leave of her new acquaintance Their parting was protracted by so many courtesies and compliments from the old lady that her patience was almost wearied out at last she get free from her and quickened her pace towards home when on a sudden she heard her in a tremulous voice calling out "Madam madam pray stop one moment" Sophia looked back and seeing Mrs Gibbons come tottering up to her with mere speed than was consistent with her weakness she met her half way and smiling asked her why she had turned back  Oh madam replied she I am ready to sink with confusion what a  solsim  in good breeding have I committed to be sure you will think I have been used to converse with savages only  Sophia not able to guess what this speech tended to looked at Mr Gibbons as if she wished for an explanation  My aunt madam said the youth blushing a little at the old woman's affectation is concerned that you should walk home alone and  that I can't offer my service to attend you being obliged to lead her as you see  That is not all nephew said the ceremonious gentlewoman you do not tell the young lady the true cause of the  dilemnia  I am in I would not leave you madam pursued she till I saw you safe home but you live with a family who has affronted me and I cannot endure to come within sight of the house I never can forgive an affront that would be to shew I do not understand the laws of good breeding but I thank heaven no body can charge me with that I was very early  instituted  into polite life but some people are not to be  assessed  with  I hope said Sophia scarce able to compose her countenance to any tolerable degree of seriousness that none of Mr Lawson's family have given you cause of complaint they seem to me incapable of affronting any one much more a person that    Oh dear madam interrupted the old lady courtesying low you do me a great deal of honour but you will find nay you must have observed already that Mrs Lawson is vulgar very vulgar she knows nothing of decorums  I am very sorry for this misunderstanding between you said Sophia and I should think it a very great happiness if I could be any way useful in renewing your friendship  Oh cried Mrs Gibbons you might as well think of joining the  Antipoles  madam as of bringing us together again and I am grieved  beyond measure when I think that it is impossible for me to wait on you  However answered Sophia you will have no objection I hope to my coming to see you  By no means madam replied Mrs Gibbons you came last into the country and you are entitled to the first visit I would not for the world break through the laws of politeness I am sorry you have so indifferent an opinion of my breeding  Sophia perceiving that the old gentlewoman was a little discomposed for this article of good breeding was a tender point with her endeavoured to bring her into good humour by some welltimed compliments and once more took leave of her but Mrs Gibbons now insisted upon her nephew's seeing her safe home saying  She would rest herself under a tree till he came back  Sophia but faintly declined this civility for she feared to offend her again and the joy that sparkled in William's eyes when his aunt made this offer of his attendance made her unwilling to disappoint him of the hope of seeing his mistress so after much ceremony on the part of Mrs Gibbons they separated  As they walked Sophia took occasion to express her concern for the violent resentment his aunt had entertained against Mr Lawson's family and which seemed to make a reconciliation hopeless  The youth told her that nothing could be more trivial than the accident that had occasioned it and yet pursued he sighing deeply  slight as it is the consequences are likely to be fatal enough  During their conversation Sophia discovered so much good sense and delicacy of sentiment in the young William that she more than ever pitied the fate of these poor lovers whose happiness was sacrificed to the capricious temper of an affected old woman she assured him she would neglect no opportunity to improve her acquaintance with his aunt  And perhaps said she with an inchanting smile that expressed the benevolence of her heart I may be so fortunate as to effect a reconciliation between her and my Dolly's family  Mr Gibbons thanked her in transports of joy and gratitude and now Dolly and her sister who had walked out in search of Sophia appearing in sight she mended her pace in order to come up with them soon for in the ardent glances that William sent towards his mistress she read his impatience to speak to her  Dolly who was in the utmost surprise to see Sophia thus accompanied took no notice of William but avoiding with a sweet bashfulness his earnest and passionate looks she fixed her eyes on Miss Darnley as if she wished to hear from her by what chance they had met  I know said Sophia to her smiling that you did not expect to see me so agreeably engaged but Mr Gibbons can inform you how his aunt whom we left in the forest yonder and I became acquainted  She then addressed some discourse to Fanny to give the lovers an opportunity of talking to each other  Dolly asked a thousand questions concerning their meeting and his aunt's behaviour to Miss Darnley  but the passionate youth leaving it to Sophia to satisfy her curiosity employed the few moments he had to stay with her in tender assurances of his own unaltered affection and complaints of her indifference  Surely said Dolly with tears in her eyes I ought not to be blamed for obeying my father  Ah my dear Dolly replied William our affections are not in the power of our fathers and if you hate me now because your father commands you to do so you never loved me  Hate you cried Dolly no Mr William my father never bid me hate you and if he had I am sure I could not have obeyed him he only commanded me to forget you  Only to forget me repeated William in a melancholy tone then you think that little Dolly and perhaps you will be able to obey him but be assured I would rather be hated by you than forgotten  "That is strange indeed" said Dolly smiling through her tears  You would not think it strange replied the youth in an accent that expressed at once grief and resentment if you had ever loved Ah Dolly are all your tender promises come to this little did I imagine I should ever see you altered thus but I will trouble you no more added he sighing as if his heart would break I will endeavour to follow your example perhaps it is not so difficult a thing as I imagined to cure one's self of love you have shewn me it is possible and if I fail in the attempt I can be  but miserable and that you have made me now  As he spoke these words he turned half from her and let fall some tears  Dolly who had no intention to make him uneasy was excessively affected with this sight and not a little alarmed at what he had said  And will you try to forget me said she in the most moving tone imaginable then indeed you will be false and perjured too for you have sworn a thousand times that you would love me for ever  Why should you wish to see me wretched said he you have resolved to love me no longer and it is but reasonable that I should try to forget you  He would have proceeded in this strain but turning to look on her he saw her sweet face overspread with tears  Oh my Dolly cried he we are very cruel to each other but I am most to blame can you pardon me my dearest say you can alas I know I do not deserve it  Dolly's heart was so opprest that she was not able to speak but she held out her hand to her young lover who seizing it eagerly prest it to his lips  Yes I will love you said he though you should hate me I will love you to my latest breath  Dolly perceiving Sophia and her sister coming up to them drew away her hand hastily but looked on him at the same time with inexpressible tenderness Sophia told him with a smile that she was afraid his aunt would be impatient upon which he made his bow and hastened back to her  Fanny now left her sister alone with Miss Darnley who perceiving that she had been weeping asked her tenderly the cause  Oh my dear miss said the poor girl blushing and pressing her hand if I had but a little of your prudence and good sense I should obey my father better but when one has once given one's heart it is very difficult to recal it  Very true my dear said Sophia therefore one ought not to be in haste to give it  I hope interupted Dolly with an anxious look you have observed nothing in Mr William to make you change your good opinion of him  Quite the contrary said Sophia I believe him to be a good and I am sure he is a sensible youth nay more I believe he has a sincere regard for you and that pursued she sighing is saying a great deal considering what reason I have to judge unfavourably of men but my dear I would have you keep your passion so far subjected to your reason as to make it not too difficult for you to obey your father if he is fully determined to refuse his content  I know added she with a gentle smile  That it is easier to be wise for others than for ourselves but I know it is not impossible for a heart in love to follow the dictates of reason I think so highly of Mr Lawson's understanding and goodness that I am persuaded he would not lay an unreasonable command upon you and by what I could collect from some hints dropt by Mrs Gibbons and the little discourse I had with your lover the old gentlewoman is wholly to blame  Did Mr William tell you said Dolly what was the occasion of their quarrel  No replied Sophia I should be glad to hear it from yourself  Well resumed Dolly taking her under the arm let us go to our dear oak then and there we shall be out of sight but I am impatient to know how you met and what conversation you had  Sophia satisfied her curiosity diverting herself a little with the old lady's hard words and her strict regard to ceremony  Ah said Dolly it was those hard words and the clutter she made about ceremony and decorum that occasioned all our unhappiness for as I told you miss she was well enough pleased with her nephew's choice saying that he was in the right to marry like a gentleman and prefer person and breeding to money however soon after she came into the country she shewed herself a little dissatisfied with my education and said that as my father was a gentleman and a scholar he ought to have taught his daughters a little Greek and Latin to have distinguished them from meer country girls  Your mother I suppose said Sophia laughed at this notion  It does not become me said Dolly to blame my mother but to be sure she took great delight in ridiculing Mrs Gibbons indeed it was scarce possible to help smiling now and then at her hard words and her formal politeness but my mother as Mr William often told me with great concern carried her raillery so far that  his aunt would certainly be offended with it at last and so indeed she was and grew every day cooler with regard to the marriage This disgusted my mother more so every thing wore a melancholy appearance at length Mrs Gibbons broke out one day violently upon my mother's sending a dish of tea to another gentlewoman before her I saw a storm in her countenance and dreading the consequence I made haste to carry her her dish myself but she refused it scornfully and then began to attack my mother in her strange language upon her want of breeding and ignorance of the rules of  precendency  that was her word My mother at first only laughed and rallied but when the rest of our visitors was gone and Mrs Gibbons only remained the quarrel grew serious My mother who was out of patience with her folly said some severe things which provoked Mrs Gibbons so much that she rose up in a fury and declared she would never more have any  collection  with such vulgar creatures At that moment my father and Mr William who had been walking together came into the room they both were excessively surprised at the disorder that appeared among us and poor Mr William who was most apprehensive turned as pale as death he gave me a melancholy look as fearing what had happened and had scarce courage enough to ask his aunt what was the matter Mean time my mother in a laughing way gave my father an account of what had happened repeating some of Mrs Gibbons's strange words and made the whole affair appear  so ridiculous that Mrs Gibbons in a great fury flung out of the house declaring that from that moment she broke off any  treatise  of marriage between her nephew and me and that if he continued to make his addresses to me she would make a will and leave all her money to a distant relation Mr William was obliged to follow his aunt but he begged my father's leave to return as soon as he had seen her safe home When he came back he implor'd my father with tears in his eyes not to forbid his seeing me he said the loss of his aunt's fortune would give him no concern if he durst hope that it would make no alteration in my father's resolutions since his own little inheritance was sufficient to maintain us comfortably My father was pleased with his generous affection for me and said a great many obliging things to him as did my mother likewise so that we thought our misfortune not so bad but the next day old Mr Gibbons came plodding to our house and with a great deal of confusion and aukwardness told my father that he was very sorry for what had happened but sister had changed her mind and would not let her nephew marry and he was afraid if he disobliged her she would leave all her money to strangers so he begged him to give his son no encouragement but to tell him plainly he must obey his aunt and his father and he said he was sure his son would mind what my father said to him more than any body else  I am in pain for poor Mr Lawson said Sophia What a boorish speech was this  My father resum'd Dolly said afterwards that if it had not been for the concern he felt for me and Mr William he would have been excessively diverted with the old man's simplicity but he answered him gravely and with great civility he promised him that the affair should go no farther that I should receive no more visits from his son and that he would talk with him and endeavour to make him submit patiently to what his father and his aunt had determined for him The old man thanked my father a thousand times over for his kindness and after a great many bows and scrapes he went away My father was as good as his word he laid his commands on me to think no more of Mr William and forbad me to see or speak to him and when Mr William came next he took him with him into his study and talked to him a long time He acknowledged that Mr William had oftener than once moved him even to tears but for all that he did not relent and we were not allowed so much as to speak to each other alone for fear we should take any measures to meet in private This I thought very severe pursued Dolly sighing we might at least have been indulged in taking leave since we were to be separated for ever  I cannot blame your father said Sophia he was indispensably obliged to act as he did it is to be wished indeed that Mrs Lawson had passed over the poor woman's follies with more temper but this cannot be helped now perhaps I may be able to serve you The old gentlewoman  seems to have taken a liking to me I shall endeavour to improve it that I may have an opportunity to soften her it is not impossible but this matter may end well yet  Poor Dolly was ready enough to admit a hope so pleasing and felt her heart more at ease than it had been a long time As for William his aunt's extravagant praises of Sophia and some expressions which she dropped intimating that she should be pleased if he could make himself acceptable to so fine a lady hinted to him a scheme which might afford him the means of seeing his mistress sometimes he seemed therefore to listen with satisfaction to these dark overtures made by his aunt and upon her speaking still plainer he said it would be presumption in him to think that a young lady so accomplished as Miss Darnley would look down upon him and besides he had no opportunity of improving an acquaintance with her being forbid Mr Lawson's house at her request  The old woman pleased to find he made so little opposition to her desire told him  That he would have opportunities enough of seeing and conversing with the lady she often walks out said she either in the forest or the fields about the house cannot you throw yourself in her way and accost her politely as you very well know how and to  felicitate  your success I will let her know that I am willing to receive the honour of a visit from her though this is against all the rules of decorum for it is my part to visit her first she being the greatest stranger here you  shall deliver my message to her tomorrow yourself  The youth replied coldly that it was possible he might not meet with her tomorrow nevertheless he would go every day to the forest and wherever it was likely she would walk in hopes of seeing her  Mrs Gibbons exulting in the hope of mortifying Mrs Lawson told her nephew  That if he could succeed in his addresses to miss Darnley and give her so fine a lady for a niece she would settle the best part of her fortune on him immediately  William suffered her to please herself with these imaginations having secured the liberty of going unsuspected and as often as he pleased to those places where he could see his beloved Dolly hitherto he had not dared to indulge himself frequently in these stolen interviews lest his aunt being informed of them should take measures to engage Mr Lawson to keep his daughter under a greater restraint but now he continually haunted the park the wood and the fields about Mr Lawson's house here he could not fail of often seeing his mistress and sometimes of speaking to her unobserved by any one  Dolly never failed to chide him as often as this happened for thus laying her under a necessity of disobeying her father's injunctions but she took no pains to shun those places where she was almost sure of meeting him and her chiding was so gentle that he was convinced she was not greatly offended  Sophia happening to meet him one morning while he was thus sauntering about she enquired for his aunt and hearing from him how desirous the old gentlewoman was of seeing her she who was full of her benevolent scheme and eager to put it in execution delayed her visit no longer than till the afternoon  Mrs Gibbons considered this as a proof of her nephew's sincerity and was in so good a humour that she listened without any signs of displeasure to the praises which Sophia artfully introduced of Dolly and even sometimes joined in them Sophia thought this a very favourable beginning and went away full of hope that she should succed in her design but while she was thus endeavouring to make others happy her sister was preparing a new mortification for her  Sir Charles continued to visit Mrs Darnley as usual he passed some hours every day at her house and while he applauded himself for the steadiness of his resolution not to follow his mistress he perceived not his own weakness in seeking every alleviation of her absence He went to the house where she had formerly dwelt because every object he saw in it brought her dear idea to his mind he loved to turn over the books he had seen her read to sit in those places where she used to sit he was transported when he saw any thing that belonged to her and when he was not observed by the inquisitive eyes of Harriot he indulged his own in gazing upon Sophia's picture faintly as it expressed the attractive graces of the original he endured the trifling discourse of Mrs Darnley  and the insipid gaiety of Harriot and left all other company and amusements to converse with them that he might hear something concerning Sophia for he had the art without seeming to design it to turn the discourse frequently upon her and thus drew from the loquacious mother all he desired to know without appearing to be interested in it  Mrs Darnley knew not what judgment to form of his assiduity in visiting her and vainly endeavoured to penetrate into his views As for Harriot who had no idea of those refinements of tenderness which influenced Sir Charles's conduct on this occasion she concluded that her charms had once more enslaved him and exulted in her fancied conquest the more as it was a triumph over her sister who had been the occasion of so many mortifications to her  Nothing is so easy or so fallacious as the belief that we are beloved and admired our own vanity helps the deceit where a deceit is intended and a coquet who has a double portion of it willingly deceives herself  Harriot was now fully persuaded that Sir Charles had forgot Sophia and was wholly devoted to her Impatient to insult her with the news of his change she proposed to her mother to make her a visit Mrs Darnley immediately consented not because she was very desirous to see her daughter but because every thing that wore the face of amusement was always acceptable to her Sir Charles upon being made acquainted with their  intention offered to accommodate them with his chariot and although he only desired them coldly to present his compliments to Sophia yet when he reflected that they would soon see and converse with her he could not help envying their happiness and it was with great difficulty he conquered himself so far as to forbear going with them  To be continued  ESSAY ON THE Original Inhabitants of GREAT BRITAIN CONTINUED  THE tranquility of Britain perished with Constantine the Great He was survived by three of his sons  Constantinus Constantius and Constans  all men of worthless or of infamous characters It would be time very ill employed to notify any particulars of their reigns let the imperial savages and one or two of their successors pass by nameless and forgotten Be it sufficient to say that the ministers and officers whom they appointed were their exact representatives haughty tyrants bloody inquisitors and rapacious governors Britain bore the share of burdens imposed upon her by these taskmasters and her inhabitants like the Israelites  were fruitful increased abundantly and waxed exceedingly mighty  otherwise how could they have withstood the inundation of Picts Scots Saxons and Attacotti  All our historical authors mention the Attacotti but none can tell exactly who these people were Dr Gale thinks them a barbarous sort of Britons living in the north of Scotland about Attarith  who in the first year of Valentinian broke  in at once though in different places upon the Roman territories in Britain  Historians have not told us in what manner the Britains sustained themselves against such numbers of invaders till Severus was sent to their relief in the year But neither Severus nor his successor Jovinus were able to vye with the barbarians who were now dispersed throughout the whole kingdom and had made great devastations in the city of London Valentinian saw an immediate necessity for a reinforcement of troops under the conduct of a veteran and experienced commander he chose Theodosius as a man of great experience and of a most martial character Theodosius lost no time in executing his commission he set sail from Boulogne and landed at Sandwich with the choicest troops that could be gathered throughout the continent He marched directly to London and found the city in the greatest distress He immediately relieved the metropolis and by a division of his army into different parties surprised the lawless freebooters in several places and divested them of their plunder which consisted of captives and herds of cattle For some time afterwards he chose rather to observe than to molest his adversaries His caution and sagacity joined to the force of his arms at length entirely effected the purposes for which he was deputed into the kingdom By degrees he drove back the Picts the Scots and all the invaders into their own territories he replaced garrisons to defend the boundaries he repaired walls and restored cities and at his return to  Rome he left the island in a state of security and peace He was attended to the shore by vast numbers of Romans and Britons all full of expressions of regret and sorrow at his departure He was received by his imperial master with the most public demonstrations of friendship gratitude and affection honours which he most justly deserved  The emperor Valentinian died in the year    He was succeeded in the western empire by his son Gratianus a young man addicted to pleasures resigned to favourites and in every respect unfit for his dignity As only chance of birth had made him an emperor and as nature had given him abilities only for a huntsman he soon found himself under a necessity of summoning a coadjutor to his assistance He chose Flavius Magnus Theodosius  Theodosius the father was put to death by the emperor Valens because  Theod  were the first letters of his name A prophet had foretold that a man whose name began with those letters should be emperor Valens cut off the prophet's head and murdered all those whose names began with  Theod  the son of the Roman general who not many years before had made so considerable a figure in Britain  At the time when the emperor Gratianus made this choice Maximus a Spaniard by birth of a very noble family and an officer of great merit and distinction was at the head of the Roman army in Britain He was personally beloved by the soldiers and had rendered himself much esteemed and revered among the Britons All his military actions had been planned upon the model of that great general Theodosius by whom he had been left in Britain in a high post of command Soon  afterwards probably in the order of succession he became the captaingeneral of the Roman and British forces Maximus was of an ambitious temper and he was much disgusted at the sudden rise of the younger Theodosius He complained loudly of the injustice which he suffered by the election of any other emperor than himself he drew his pretensions from his near degree of affinity to Constantine the Great and his army without an examination into the truth or falshood of those pretensions immediately saluted him Caesar and offered to him their service and obedience  In what a state of confusion were the Romans and the Britons at this period little able to help themselves much less to assist their allies two emperors in Italy and one  Flavius Magnus Clemens Maximus  risen up on a sudden in Britain The account of these times is very elaborately although in many points very differently set forth by the Scotch and English historians But the prospect we receive from all those commentaries are only melancholy and various views of rage and bloodshed Revolutions upon revolutions Gratianus killed by the troops of Maximus Maximus put to death by Theodosius Britain invaded by the Scots and Picts the Scots extirpated by the Picts from Scotland and driven into Ireland in the continent a declining empire in our own island a perpetual civil war throughout the world an iron age  Insidiae{que} et vis et amor sceleratus habendi  Mix'd with curs'd avarice falshood and rapine shone  Such was the dismal scene some little intervals excepted during the whole reign of Theodosius who died in the beginning of the year He left two sons Arcadius and Honorius The western empire fell to the lot of Honorius who was only ten years of age at the death of his father he was committed to the tuition and conduct of Stilico Under his government the Saxons Scots and Picts those perpetual invaders of the British territories were effectually suppressed and repulsed  But Stilico was called off from his attention to the affairs of Britain by the appearance of Alaric  Alaric was rather general than king of the Goths He was one of the most formidable enemies of the Roman empire He sack'd Rome itself A D O  in Italy at the head of a most numerous army of Goths The Roman troops were immediately summoned to the continent as not only the empire but the whole world seemed to be in danger of ruin and was afterwards over run by this set of barbarians  Here I think may be dated the end of the Roman government in Britain Some assistance some legions were sent now and then upon the supplication of the Britons in the southern parts of the island to relieve them from immediate destruction but such succours were few uncertain and at last absolutely withdrawn  At this particular period let us endeavour to take a general retrospect of the Britons their manners their laws and their government as far as the obscurity and the many chasms of our history will allow the search  Caesar and many other authors describe the original Britons appearing in the wildest state of nature savages living upon plunder inhabiting woods and mountains and ignorant of all laws and order The description I am afraid is in many instances too true but however licentious and untamed these barbarians may have been some form of government certainly subsisted amongst them especially as Caesar himself says that the customs of the Britons were almost the same as the customs of the Gauls But he speaks indeed there only of the Cantii  The inhabitants of Kent  who living nearest to the Gallic shores were most humanized  In his account of the Gauls he tells us in how great a degree of obedience the lower classes of people were held by the nobility an obedience which could not have been formed or regulated without a complete and acknowledged system of laws The particulars of those laws are not perfectly ascertained they were always composed by the Druids who never suffered any of their institutions to be committed to writing  Some of them however have been handed down to us and are sufficiently curious to be inserted They are these  I None must be instructed but in the sacred groves  II Misletoe must be gathered with reverence and if possible in the sixth moon It must be cut with a golden bill  III Every thing derives its origin from heaven  IV The arcana of the sciences must not be committed to writing but to the memory  V Great care is to be taken of the education of children  VI The powder of misletoe makes women fruitful  VII The disobedient  By  disobedient  I presume is meant the atheists deists methodists and nonconformists of those days  are to be shut out from the sacrifices  VIII Souls are immortal  IX The soul after death goes into other bodies  X If the world is destroyed it will be by fire and water  XI Upon extraordinary emergencies a man must be sacrificed According as the body falls or moves after it is fallen according as the blood flows or the wound opens future events are foretold  XII Prisoners are to be slain upon the altars or burnt alive inclosed in wicker in honour of the Gods  XIII All commerce with strangers must be prohibited  XIV He that comes last to the assembly of the states ought to be punished with death  XV Children are to be brought up apart from their parents till they are fourteen years of age  XVI Money lent in this world will be repaid in the next  XVII There is another world and they who kill themselves to accompany their friends thither will live with them there  XVIII Letters given to dying persons or thrown on the funeral piles of the dead will faithfully be delivered in the other world  XIX The moon is a sovereign remedy for all things  as its name in Celtic implies  XX Let the disobedient be excommunicated let him be deprived of the benefit of the law let him be avoided and rendered incapable of any employ  XXI All masters of families are kings in their own houses they have a power of life and death over their wives children and slaves  The learning and the religious tenets of the Druids are specified in various authors Diogenes Laertius assures us that their chief precepts were  the worship of the Gods an abstinence from all kinds of evil and a constant exercise of manly fortitude  Pomponius Mela informs us that the Druids were remarkably expert in geography and astronomy  These were the Eubates or lowest order of Druids  and Caesar says that they taught the transmigration of souls and by that means inspired their disciples with an absolute contempt of death which in their articles of faith was looked upon only as a passage from one body to another or as Mr Rowe expresses it from Lucan's description of the Druids  "A stop which can but for a moment last  "A point between the present and the past"  The character of these priests must have appeared extremely venerable had not their doctrines  been attended by the most sanguinary acts of superstition which certainly augmented or at least never could suppress the natural savageness and barbarity of the natives The Bards were a lower order of the Druids their sacerdotal employments were the celebration of the British heroes in verses which they sung to the harp and which were probably composed to excite emulation in the hearers of their poetry Such a design had an a  of policy and might in some measure be conducive to tame the ferocious natures of those who listened either from piety or curiosity to their songs There were still a third and inferior o  of Druids called Eubates and there were also Druids not many I presume of the female  The original constitution of Britain was  monarchical All authors agree that  island was divided into colonies each of  subject to a particular sovereign U  and dangerous emergencies the Britons▪  general assembly of their princes unanimo  one superior chieftain to whom they  the command of the army and the govern  f the state such were Cassivelaunus  Boudicea Carausius and Galga  us  these royal magistrates were temporary or  dictators is a point that does not seem perfec  y cleared up by any of the historians when they had the power it is probable they kept it most if not all of them came to sudden and fatal catastrophes The Britons were subdued by Julius Caesar and they were treated with great tyranny and oppression by all succeeding Roman empe  o  s  governors legates and propraetors till Agricola lightened and diversified if he did not remove the oppression In the reigns of Nerva and Trajan the Caledonians and the Britons were most firmly united and the consequence of their union had almost produced a total extirpation of the Romans Adrian  Successor of Trajan  probably with a design to sow the seeds of disagreement between the two nations enlarged the frontiers of the Scots permitted them to come forwarder towards the south and resigned to them that portion of lands which in the time of the elder Theodosius was distinguished as a fifth province and was called Valentia The Meatae and the Picti settled themselves in this district  Whatever might be Adrian's motives dissension grew up most prosperously and rooted itself so firmly and deeply in the soil that no association was afterwards formed between the Britons and the Caledonians By the Caledonians I would be understood to mean tbe inhabitants of Scotland whether distinguished by the names of Picts Meatae Scots Scythians or any other denominations To fix the time of their arrival and their settlement in Great Britain is difficult if not impossible the inquiry is now intirely useless Their wars their incursions their depredations and their policy are points to reflect some entertainment their origin and the fabulous tales that attend it must in general be despised and forgotten  The Caledonians ever a crafty and a wise nation had tasted the sweets and had experienced  the advantages arising from frequent inroads into Britain Their own country was barren and uncultivated the adjoining territories were rich and fruitful their gains consequently might be great their losses could only amount to a repulse Caesar tells us that the Britons thought it unlawful to taste hares hens or geese of which they kept great plenty for their pleasure and diversion the Caledonians had no such scruple of taste or conscience The British fowl their game of all kinds and their numerous herds of cattle were a sort of plunder easily taken and as easily carried away and these tempting objects of hostility drew the Saxons and the Hibernians almost annually across the sea in search of prizes and acquisitions from Britain They were constantly joined and assisted by the Picts and the Meatae so that a variety of repeated invasions totally employ the first annals of our history and leave us scarce any other characteristical idea of our forefathers than their bravery and resistance  Early in the fifth century the Romans now grown so weak as to perceive within themselves evident symptoms of dissolution took a last farewel of our ancestors and like expiring friends exerted their last efforts amidst convulsive pangs to assist and direct the Britons how to build a wall of stone in the same situation where the wall of Severus had formerly stood and still as a final instance of their friendship they advised the natives to practise the art of war and to become expert and regular in military discipline but most especially to act upon one general confederate plan by making  use of their own collective strength against the Caledonians and all other invaders The advice was excellent and if pursued with constancy and firmness might have rendered the Britons for ever impregnable to their enemies But unanimity among Britons was reserved for distant times and the happiest age that our island has ever known  By the departure of the Romans the Britons looked upon themselves as delivered from their first conquerors but they little considered that they were still subject to a worse set of tyrants their own passions and disunion no people upon earth are formed with more acute sensations or deeper resentments against each other These are the causes that fill our history with such frequent revolutions Our climate is a representation of our nature it is uncertain and in the space of one week affords as much variety of weather as is known in other countries throughout a twelvemonth A single day is often a scene of summer and of winter and of great heat and of violent cold of rain and snow and of warmth and sunshine so various is the temperature of our air The temperature of air governs the minds of the inhabitants we are gloomy or gay sullen or goodhumoured and sometimes religious or immoral according to the state and alterations of our atmosphere What must be the effects arising from such variegated dispositions continual changes and continual discontent Britons left to themselves are like horses unbridled and let out to pasture they wince they roar they kick their heels towards heaven in all the wantonness of liberty Their freedom might be perpetual  if they knew how to direct it or were conscious of their own strength but they employ their time in selfdestruction they impoliticly tread down the pasture which ought to feed them and inconsiderately striking at each other they become so lame as to stand in need of assistance from the first aukward farrier who presents himself Gildas I think defines our island as a  land steady in nothing and greedy of every thing new  Such indeed it proved after the removal of the Romans successive royal idols were set up worshipped and then taken down and trampled to pieces The names of these molten calves are insignificant their actions as sovereigns immaterial and uncertain they were elected adored and destroyed The reign of Vortigern indeed was of longer duration and of more consequence it afforded scenes of variety and importance We are told that while Vortigern was upon the throne the Britons finding themselves overpowered and almost ruined by invasions from the Scots and Picts sent a solemn embassy with most submissive letters to implore the assistance and to require the immediate presence of their old enemies the Saxons Is it possible to believe our ancestors guilty of so absurd a resolution That they were factious discontented and unversed in the rules of government is certain but that they should imagine themselves under a necessity of seeking refuge from Charybdis because they were close upon the rocks of Scylla is highly improbable How indeterminate are the historical accounts of this particular period when the introduction of the Saxons is recorded in a  manner that bears so little resemblance to truth The Britons might not be willing or more probably might not be capable to oppose the Saxons when those invaders were arrived but it is scarce credible to imagine that the Britons sollicited their arrival However by the generality of historians we are to suppose that the sheep invited the wolves A modern writer  Guthrie vol i p  differs from many of his predecessors and tells us from Nennius that the arrival of the Saxons was accidental the only fact that can be depended upon is that  they arrived  The year cannot be ascertained  In all probability about the middle of the fifth century According to Nennius A D  in that point the chronologists differ But of what nation shall we find the chronology ascertained  The Saxons were commanded by two brothers Hengist and Horsa men of judgment and penetration who finding their first design of plunder and devastation insupportable tacitly changed the plan and offered themselves as friends and confederates to the Britons At so critical a juncture they were joyfully received by Vortigern and were incorporated into the British army The island of Thanet was assigned for their settlement their numbers did not exceed fifteen hundred three ships transported them into Britain  Hengist and Horsa soon distinguished themselves as allies of consequence The Picts and Scots were driven back to their several territories some to Caledonia others to Ireland and the Saxons retired to the isle of Thanet with all possible demonstrations of peace  The articles of compact between the Saxons and the Britons were these  That the Saxons were to fight for the Britons against all foreign enemies and were to receive the pay and maintenance from the nation for whom they fought  In the general name of Saxons were included the Jutes and the Angles who had enlisted themselves under the banner of Hengist and Horsa These two brothers were the direct descendants of Woden an Asiatic king who came from Scythia into Europe and seized those German territories that are now distinguished as Saxony The Angles were inhabitants of Sweden The Jutes were a people of Denmark Whilst the number of these Saxons did not exceed fifteen hundred the articles of compact were not difficult to be fulfilled But Hengist and Horsa had farther views than merely a subsistance from the Britons the isle of Thanet was too limited a circumference for their ambition a settlement and some degree of power within the greater island were the objects upon which they had fixed their eyes Of the two brothers Hengist seems to have been particularly vigilant and politic he considered the fertility of the soil the inexperience of the inhabitants and the weak passions of the king and from these circumstances he proposed to himself and to his people all the future advantages that they could wish riches alliance and a kingdom In consequence of such a plan he sent for fresh supplies of his countrymen and they came over in tribes sufficiently numerous to fill seventeen ships With them arrived Rowena the daughter of Hengist her father had particularly observed the amorous disposition  of Vortigern and conscious of his daughter's beauty he proposed to make her the chief step by which he was to ascend The effect answered the design Vortigern saw the fair Saxon divorced his lawful wife by whom he had many children and incontinently married Rowena In consequence of this marriage the kingdom of Kent was allotted to the Saxons and the dominion of that territory was taken away from Guorangonus the reigning prince and was bestowed upon Hengist the fatherinlaw of the chief sovereign in Britain  How unhappy must be the state of government when the king could break through all the bounds of morality and where the people could tamely submit to see one of their most considerable colonies peremptorily given away to strangers These instances shew us that not the least order and scarce any degree of public courage subsisted at this time in Britain they shew us that christianity had not as yet taken sufficient root in our island A religion that was calculated to rescue mankind from the tyranny of fraud and force and instituted to give a true notion of one God and to fix right and justice upon a sure and natural foundation must have little efficacy among a wild and indocile race of men Some churches however were built and some outward appearances of religion were maintained but the antiquities of these times are so fabulous that few authentic commentaries are extant either of ecclesiastical or of civil affairs The facts to be depended upon are these  To be continued  THE HISTORY OF THE COUNT DE COMMINGE CONTINUED  THE meeting between my father and me was on my side full of respect but coldness and  I have given you leisure said he to me to repent of your folly and I am now come to give you the means to make me forget it return this instance of my indulgence with obedience and prepare to receive as you ought the count of Foix and mademoiselle de Foix his daughter for whom I have destined you The marriage shall be solemnized here they will arrive tomorrow with your mother I came before them only to give the necessary orders for their reception  I am sorry Sir replied I calmly that I cannot comply with your wishes I have too much honour to marry a person I can never love therefore I intreat you will permit me to leave this  place directly Mademoiselle de Foix however amiable she may be cannot alter my resolution and if I see her the affront I shall give her by refusing her hand will be more poignant to her  No interrupted my father in a rage thou shalt not see her nor shalt thou be allowed to see the day I will shut thee up in a dungeon a fitter habitation I swear by heaven that thou shalt never be delivered from thy confinement till I am convinced thy repentance is sincere and thy change certain I will punish thee for thy disobedience every way that is in my power I will deprive thee of my estate and settle it upon mademoiselle de Foix to fulfil in some degree the promise I have given her  I made no opposition to my father's tyrannical design I suffered myself to be conducted to an old tower where I was confined in a place at the bottom of it which received no light but from a little grated window which looked into one of the courts of the castle My father gave orders that food should be brought me twice aday but that I should not be suffered to see any person whatever  I passed the first days of my confinement with tranquility enough and even with some kind of pleasure What I had so lately done for Adelaida employed all my thoughts and left no room for reflection on the horrors of my condition but when this sentiment began to lose its force I resigned myself up to despair at being thus doomed to an absence of which I knew not the end My busy imagination tortured me with the apprehension of a thousand other evils Adelaida might be forced  to enter into another engagement I fancied her surrounded with rivals all assiduous to please while I had none to plead for me but my miseries but to a mind so generous as Adelaida's was not this sufficient I reproached myself for entertaining the least doubt I asked her pardon for it as for a crime and my heart gathered new strength from the confidence I had in her fidelity  My mother found means to convey a letter to my hands in which she exhorted me to submit to my father whose rage against me seemed to increase every day She added that she suffered a great deal herself that her endeavours to procure a reconciliation between him and the family of Lussan had made him suspect that she acted in concert with me  I was greatly affected at the uneasiness my mother suffered on my account but as I could not accuse myself of having voluntarily caused her any part of it all I could do was to lament her situation  One day when I was as usual wholly taken up with reflections on my unhappy fate something fell through the window into my dungeon which immediately rouzed my attention I saw a letter on the floor I seized it with trembling haste but what became of me when I read the contents they were as follow  Your father's rage has instructed me what I ought to do I know the terrible situation you are in and I know but one method to extricate you from it which will perhaps make you more miserable but I shall be so as well as you and that thought will give me resolution to do  what is required of me Our cruel parents to make it impossible for me to be yours insist upon my marrying another This is the price your father has set upon your liberty it will perhaps cost me my life my quiet it too surely will to pay it but I am determined Your sufferings and your prison are at present all that I can think of in a few days I shall be the wife of the marquis de Benavides his character is sufficient to acquaint me with all I have to suffer from him but this sort of fidelity I owe you at least that in the engagement I enter into I should find nothing but misery May you on the contrary be happy your good fortune will be my consolation I am sensible I ought not to tell you this if I was truly generous I should suffer you to be ignorant of the part you have in my marriage I should leave you in doubt of my constancy I had formed a design to do so but I was not able to execute it in my sad situation I have need of being supported with the thought that the remembrance of me will not be hateful to you Alas soon very soon it will not be permitted me to preserve yoursI must forget youat least I must endeavour so to doOf all my miseries this is what I am most sensible of you will increase it if you do not carefully avoid all opportunities of seeing and speaking to me Reflect that you owe me this mark of your esteem and oh reflect how dear that esteem will be to me since of all the sentiments you have profest for me it is the only one that I am allowed to require of you  Of this fatal letter which I have related at length I was able to read no more than to these words  Our cruel parents to make it impossible for me to be yours insist upon my marrying another  Pierced to the heart with this cruel this unexpected misfortune I sunk upon the mattrass which composed my bed and lay there several hours without sense or motion and probably might never have recovered but for the assistance of the person who brought me my provisions If he was alarmed at the condition in which he found me he was much more so at the excess of my despair when my senses returned The letter which I held fast in my hand during my swoon and which I at last read quite through was wet with my tears and I spoke and acted extravagancies which made him apprehensive for my reason  This man who till then had been inaccessible to pity was melted all on a sudden he blamed my father for his cruel treatment of me he reproved himself for having executed his orders he asked my pardon on his knees His repentance inspired me with the thought of proposing to him to let me quit my prison for eight days only promising him that at the expiration of that time I would return and put myself into his hands I added every thing I could think of to oblige him to consent Moved at the state he saw me in excited by his own interest and by the fear that I should one day take vengeance upon him for being the instrument of my father's cruelty he agreed to what I desired upon the condition I had myself proposed to him  I would have set out that moment from the castle but there was a necessity for his going to seek for horses and when he returned he informed me that we could not get any till the next day My design was to go to Adelaida to tell her all my grief and despair and to kill myself before her eyes if she persisted in her resolution  To execute this project it was necessary that I should arrive before her fatal marriage and every moment's delay seemed to me an age of misery I read over her letter a hundred times as if I had expected to find still something more in it I examined the date over and over I flattered myself that the time might have been prolonged  She will at least make an effort said I she will seize all pretences to defer it But why should I flatter myself with so vain a hope resumed I Adelaida sacrificing herself for my liberty will hasten the dreadful moment Alas can she believe that liberty without her can be a blessing to me I shall every where find this prison she delivers me from she has never known my heart she judges of me by other men it is to that I owe my ruin I am still more miserable than I believed myself since I have not the consolation to think that she knows how much I love her  I past the whole night in making these complaints the most tedious night I had ever known even in that place of misery At length the day appeared I mounted on horseback with my conductor We travelled the whole day without stopping a moment when towards the evening I perceived my mother in a chariot which took the road  towards the castle She knew me immediately and after having expressed her surprize at meeting me she obliged me to come into the chariot to her I durst not ask her the occasion of her journey in the situation I was in I feared every thing and my fear was but too well founded  I come my son said she by your father's permission to release you from your confinement  Ah cried I then Adelaida is married  My mother answered only by silence My misfortune which was then without remedy presented itself to my mind with all its horrid aggravations I fell into a kind of stupidity and by the force of grief I seemed to have lost the sense of it However my body now sunk under the weakness of my mind I was seized in the coach with a shivering like the cold fit of an ague As soon as we arrived at the castle my mother caused me to be put to bed I lay two days without speaking or taking any nourishment all the symptoms of a violent fever appeared and on the fourth the physician despaired of my life My mother who never left me was inconceiveably afflicted her tears her prayers and the name of Adelaida by which she conjured me to live made me resolve not to obstruct the endeavours of the physician to save me  To be continued  THE HISTORY OF BIANCA CAPELLO CONTINUED  THE polite behaviour and promises of Mandragone gave such agreeable hopes to Bianca that with quite another countenance than before she renewed her conversation with his lady who a little after taking her by the hand said I have a mind to show you our palace that you may tell me if in any thing it resembles your great and noble buildings at Venice and in the mean time the old lady your mother as she is in years and feeble may repose herself here till our return  Aye aye go replied she for I have not breath enough to mount such a staircase  upon which the young women smiling and arm in arm ran from room to room almost over the whole house This palace which stood in the street called Carnesecchi near Santa Maria Novella was so lately built that it was not quite finished though very near so and that with such good taste and so much magnificence that the  Venetian lady admired and praised every part of it and now through many antichambers they arrived at last to a very large one where there was an extreme rich bed and near it a writing closet beautifully ornamented the window of which looked down on a delightful garden Here the Spaniard having opened a scrutore took out a vast quantity of jewels which one by one she shewed her guest to whom while she was looking on them with great attention she spoke in this manner  I have a great fancy to shew you some dresses I have lately made which they tell me are exactly as the Venetian ladies wear them but as I must fetch the key I beg you will divert yourself with these few jewels till I come back  No sooner was Mandragona gone out of the closet but on a sudden the grand duke entered it at whose unexpected presence Bianca trembled from head to foot well imagining the meaning of his coming but collected in herself and alike prudent and virtuous she immediately threw herself at his feet and in the most moving manner said  Since sir it has pleased God that it should be my unhappy fate to lose my parents my fortune and my country and to have nothing in this world left me but my honour permit me humbly to entreat your royal highness's protection for that only good which I esteem more than all the rest  The grand duke hearing her talk in this manner presently raised her from the ground with the greatest respect saying  You have no reason madam to fear any thing from me who only  come here to assist and comfort you under those misfortunes I grieve to see you suffer of the truth of which my actions shall soon convince you let me then beg you to be satisfied that you have found a friend in me both willing and able to make you happy  and so saying he bowed and left her all pale and confused which the Spaniard perceiving at her return said  Don't wonder madam at the abrupt appearance of the grand Duke for he is pleased to live in that familiarity with us that very often and at all hours he comes in this way diverting himself with jesting and frightening my maids and me but this time I believe he is well met withal and I don't doubt but that you have given him an answer that has put him out of countenance and perhaps will make him more cautious for the future  I made him no answer said the Venetian but what the care of my honour obliged me to and which I recommended to the mercy and protection of his serene highness  And you may be certain he will protect it said Mandragone  But can a lady of your sense and quickness added she not perceive that fortune in compassion to your tedious sufferings has at last turn'd her face and will you not seize the golden opportunity Believe me madam these are accidents that seldom happen to have so young so charming and so great a prince devote his heart with the sincerest passion to your service  Many were the arguments that these two ladies used to maintain their different opinions but at the last those of the Spaniard prevailed with Bianca Capello to hear the grand duke and having heard she soon consented to accept his love the charms of his conversation and person encreasing every day her inclination for him till their passion became mutual  Having traced poor Bianca through all those thorny paths that brought her to the flowery precipice into which she fell we will now turn to Pietro Buonaventuri her husband and see how his new fortune became him still young and handsome and still beloved by his wife so that upon her account the grand Duke not only made him master of the robes but gave him a most magnificent palace in the street named Maggio with such great appointments that he enjoyed all the happiness this world could give  His apartment was on the groundfloor from whence he could ascend to his wife's except when the grand Duke was with her and in that case the door to them was fastened on the other side this happened frequently Francisco generally dismissing his train when he came home in an evening and only with one or two confidents going privately to sup with signora Bianca whom he could seldom bring himself to leave till an hour before day obliged him to return to his palace which he did in the same manner he left it  Long did this course of life and round of pleasure last and longer still it might have done had not the prosperity and power of Pietro now become very  considerable all over Florence filled his mind with so much pride and insolence that his desires alone dictated all his actions without the least regard to form or decency Amongst the many ladies whose affections he sought to acquire was a widow called Cassandra Bongianni descended from one of the greatest families in the city whose extraordinary beauty had gained her many admirers to some of which it had proved very fatal her relations to revenge the dishonour done their family having already miserably destroyed two of them one of which a young man of the family of del Caccia after giving him several mortal wounds they dipp'd in pitch and with a straw hat on his head and a basket full of balls of packthread on his arm set him on a stone near the door of his mistress so that all the people who passed thinking it was a country man asleep took no notice of him till towards evening some body going to wake him discovered the truth to the great concern of all who knew him and more particularly his parents who after they had buried him sought in vain for the authors of his death though every body's conjecture centered on the relations of the lady  Notwithstanding all this was well known to Buonaventuri it did not in the least intimidate him from pursuing his enterprize which as he was insinuating young and beautiful he soon attained and not content with his victory he gloried in the publication of it jesting upon and laughing in the very faces of any of her relations whom he met and being one day particularly impertinent to  Roberto Ricci her nephew he unable to endure it complained to his aunt threatning her extremely if she pursued so vile a practice which though she positively denied to him she still continued in such a manner as made it obvious to all the city nor did Pietro from this grow more discreet but as before he had only laughed at them he began now to menace and insult them which for some time they feared to resent out of respect to the grand Duke but at last their patience being exhausted they went all together and represented to his serene highness the injuries they suffered from Buonaventuri begging he would command him to behave in a more reasonable way  The grand Duke was very much concerned to hear of the ill behaviour of Buonaventuri and promised it should be remedied When they were gone he immediately sent for Pietro and taking him into his closet told him the complaints he had received from Ricci and the rest of Bongianni's relations adding these words  You see therefore how great is the uneasiness such things give to families and as this is one of the most considerable in our dominions you ought to have some regard to it instead of which you are not content to possess the aunt but must insult and ridicule the nephew and that in the most public places and most opprobrious manner all this forces me to warn you that as your actions are unjust perhaps they may draw on bad consequences and should these people kill you 'tis not in my power to restore you to life so that if you cannot or will not leave pursuing  this amour at least do it with more secrecy and decorum  The haughty Buonaventuri having heard the gracious admonitions of Francisco which being deliver'd with so much reason and calmness he ought to have esteemed them as the greatest of favours returned this answer  As I assure your royal highness there is not one word of truth in all that these men have said being neither so extravagant nor impertinent as they would make me appear so I have not the least fear of them but the true cause of their anger is their envy they cannot bear to see me in that state to which your highness's bounty has raised me and therefore with calumnies endeavour to deprive me of it envying also their own blood whose fortune like wolves they would devour and as they know I have a friendship for that lady and am some protection to her from their cruelty they are resolved to ruin us both by this monstrous contrivance  I know nothing of these affairs replied the grand duke nor do I mean to enter into them 'tis enough that I have advised you as a friend do as you please what happens after this will be owing to yourself alone  and so saying he dismissed him  Yet little did Buonaventuri profit by the kind remonstrances of the great Duke growing every day more furious and offensive committing so many outrages against all the relations of Cassandra and treating Ricci especially in so despicable a manner that he was often ready to take a full revenge  being only detained from it by the fear of losing his fortune by the grand Duke's resentment at last he resolved to renew his complaints to him and as he was much in favour with the princess Isabella his sister he chose to do it by her means to whom he protested he was not able to support any longer the scorn of the world and abominable impudence of Pietro to deliver himself from which if he could find no other redress he said he should be obliged at last to abandon the consideration of his fortune and every thing else  The princess having heard him out went directly to her brother whom she made sensible of the vile carriage of Buonaventuri and of the mischiefs that might attend it representing the approaching ruin of that whole injur'd family who were so enraged as to have no farther restraint either from their obedience to their sovereign or reason itself  The grand Duke promised a speedy and effectual redress and considering with himself that the only way to it was to send Pietro from Florence till this hatred should be abated by time and absence he determined to employ him in some of his affairs abroad and as soon as he came to Bianca Capello that night he told her all that had passed on the occasion desiring her to use all sorts of arguments both persuasive and threatning that might induce Buonaventuri to change his proceedings and for the future to act more wisely "But if you can't prevail added he I will send him to France where he shall stay till he is sensible of his errors"  This was like a dagger to the heart of poor Bianca who still loved her husband to excess though she did not let it appear to the grand duke and fearing that he would as he said send him away she resolved to try all the rhetoric of prayers and tears to turn him from his dangerous course and keep him with herself For that purpose she waited his coming home which was always late and when she heard him below in his apartment she descended the back stairs and began in this manner  Since my love to you exceeds all that is or ever was of passionate and kind let me by that conjure you to hear me out with patience for what I have to say concerns you in the nearest manner and is absolutely necessary to your preservation  and then in few words she proceeded to tell him all that the grand duke had said to her and the resolution he had taken for his security to send him out of the country  To be continued  TREATISE ON THE EDUCATION of DAUGHTERS CONTINUED  CHAP IV Cautions concerning Imitation  THE ignorance of children whose brain hath as yet taken no impression and who have no formed habits is what occasions their pliancy and inclination to imitate all they see It is therefore a very principal point to set before them none but the best models no sort of persons should be suffered to come near them but such as it would be advantageous to copy after But as it is impossible notwithstanding all our precaution but they must see many irregularities we should teach them timely to remark the faulty behaviour of vicious and irrational people such whose reputation is irretrievably lost they should be shewn how deservedly despicable how miserable they are who abandon themselves to their passions and neglect the cultivation of their reason  By this means we may without fear of giving them a turn for mockery form their taste and inspire a sensibility of whatever is truly graceful Nay we need not refrain from general cautions with relation to some sorts of defects altho' there should be a danger by such proceedings of giving them an insight into the weaknesses of people to whom they owe respect for besides that we ought not to hope nor would it be just to keep  them ignorant of the true maxims relative to those points so is it the surest way of keeping them in their duty to instil the notion that they must bear with another's defects not even judge of them inconsiderately that they often appear greater than they really are that a number of other good qualities atone for them that as perfection is not to be found upon earth we should admire those who have least imperfection in short though this species of information ought to be reserved for extremities nevertheless it is our duty to give the true principles and to preserve them from imitating indiscriminately whatever evil shall happen to come in sight  Besides all this we should discourage them from personating ridiculous people This turn for comic mockery has something in it low and repugnant to genteel sentiment besides which it is much to be feared lest children should catch these manners because the warmth of their imaginations the suppleness of their bodies and their sprightliness together give them an aptness in taking all sorts of forms for the representing every ridiculous object  This propensity in children to imitation produces infinite mischief when they are put into the hands of bad people and who act with no reserve in their company But God hath indued them by the same means with a pliableness to whatever is set before them for their good very often without speaking it sufficeth only to make them observe in another the thing we would have them do  To be continued  The  SWALLOWTAIL'D  Butterfly and the ICHNEUMON Fly in their several States  PHILOSOPHY FOR THE LADIES CONTINUED  The natural History of the Swallowtail'd Butterfly and its Ichneumon  IN a former Number of this work our fair readers may remember we gave them some account of the several metamorphoses or alterations from one state to another which various classes of animals undergo But although we mentioned in general terms the changes of the butterfly kind yet as we entered into no very particular detail in regard to them it will not we hope be look'd on as any kind of repetition if we take up a short portion of their time on that head here  That beautiful and almost infinitely varied genus of insects which is so well known by the names of butterfly and moth the one meaning only a day the other a night fly is to be ranked with those of the most perfect change as every one of this kind passes through the greatest number of  states that has yet been discovered amongst animals viz the egg worm chrysalis and fly But to render these terms more clear and at the same time to relate the general history of this extensive province in the great kingdom of nature we shall illustrate it with an example  The butterfly we have fixed on for this purpose is one of the most beautiful as well as the largest that we know of English growth it is commonly known by the name of the Swallow Tail from the figure of its underwings which terminate in some measure like the tail of that bird Some authors indeed have called it the fennel fly because the caterpillar which produces it is fondest of feeding on fennel though it is not uncommonly found upon dill parsley carrot and several other umbelliferous plants But Linnaeus whose names are frequently as absurdly arbitrary as his system is laboriously ingenious has bestowed on it the name of Machaon who was a celebrated Greek physician and son to Esculapius  His first state is like that of all other insects an egg which is laid by its parent on the plant that is afterwards to become food for the infant worm at the emersion into life She however seldom lays more than two never more than three or four on one plant and those singly and at a considerable distance from each other These eggs are yellow and of a conical form and are so sixt by the female with a strong glutinous matter to the stalk of the plant as to stand all the fiercest attacks of the wind and rain without being forced  from their hold One of them as affixed to a piece of a stalk is represented at  c  in the annexed plate  These eggs which are generally laid in June July or August come to perfection in about a month's time when the young caterpillar breaks forth the same in every respect but bulk that it appears when full grown its body is green annulated or striped transversely with striae of black each ringlet studded with spots of a bright scarlet This caterpillar leads a very solitary life there seldom being more than two to be found on one plant The reason of this may probably be that the umbelliferous plants in general and more particularly the fennel which as we have before observed is the favourite food of this caterpillar afford but a very small quantity of foliage and that this worm before its next change grows to a very considerable bulk The parent instructed by that most infallible of all properties instinct purposely deposits her eggs so sparingly lest the future offspring forming too large a colony to be maintained by one plant should be forced to seek out for fresh quarters in which case unless they chanced to meet with another plant of the same kind with that they quitted they must inevitably perish They are very slow in feeding and in their growth cast their skins several times before they change into a Chrysalis In some the green is more or less bright but in general the colours are more vivid in their infant state than when more fully grown  This caterpillar has one property peculiar to itself which is that on the approach of any fly or  ichneumon it puts forth from the two red spots on its forehead a pair of antennae or horns like those of a snail and then beats about from side to side with the fore part of its body in order to prevent the Ichneumon from emitting or fixing any eggs on its body Two of these caterpillars at their full growth the one at rest the other with its antennae put forth and defending itself from the ichneumon are represented at  d  and  e  His next state is that of the Chrysalis which foreseeing for some little time beforehand he prepares for by abstaining from food and discharging his excrements which done he fixes himself by his two hind legs with a web to some part of the stalk of the plant and then spinning a thin single thread across his body between the third and fourth joint remains as it were suspended and immoveable for about four and twenty hours when by a continued motion the skin is stripped off and he becomes converted to the Chrysalis shewn at  f  This transformation happens in August or September according as the spring may be early or late and in this situation he passes the whole winter and ensuing spring coming out about the May or June following in the form of the large and beautiful butterfly represented at A and B The wings are of a bright yellow with borders and bands of a deep black the under pair still farther decorated with a chain of fine blue spots and two circles of a full orange These flies feed on the dulcet juices of flowers the moisture of which they suck in by means of a long proboscis wherewith they are provided They are frequenly seen  sitting with their wings folded as at  a  on the ground near rivers and ponds  Those who are desirous of breeding these flies themselves in order to see their changes or to procure the butterfly in greater perfection may find the caterpillars during the months abovementioned in places abounding with the umbelliferous plants When discovered they must be carefully supplied with fresh food when the Chrysalis is obtained it must be kept temperate and not much disturbed and the box or cage must be roomy in order for the wings to expand themselves otherwise they will be liable to be injur'd when the fly issues from the shell  They copulate as soon as they appear in the fly state lay their eggs in about a fortnight afterwards and then soon die  As in our description of the abovementioned butterfly we took notice of the manner in which the caterpillar whereby it is produced defends itself from the attacks of the Ichneumon it may not be improper in this place to explain what we mean by that term especially as it opens an entire new scene in the natural history of the insect tribe in which the great parent who provides sustenance for all creatures in different ways and has in general contrived it so that the larger and more powerful shall prey on and destroy the smaller ones seems to contradict herself by enabling a small animal to subsist on the very flesh and juices of one much larger than itself and that even whilst it continues alive and apparently in good health  The Ichneumon then is a class of small flies whereof there are a very great variety of species the proper nourishment of the worm of which is the body of some other caterpillar On this account the parent finds means to deposit its eggs on or rather underneath the skin of such caterpillar which hatching in due time the worm immediately begins to feed on the very entrails of the caterpillar nor ever quits it even though it frequently changes into a Chrysalis as if it were by a metamorphosis to elude its enemy till the time when his own change is to happen which he undergoes first into an Aurelia and then into a Fly emerging in the last form from the very spot where he first found residence in that of an egg  The fly which is represented in the same plate with the Swallow Tail sitting at  g  and in its flying position at  b  is one of this sort preys on the caterpillar of that butterfly and is produced in the following manner  The female fly emits an egg which is represented in its natural size and shape  i  on the caterpillar either at the time when the caterpillar is asleep or soon after it has received a new skin This egg by means of a glutinous matter which the parent emits at the same time with it is so fixed where it is deposited as not to be got off without the utmost difficulty and being in less than seven days hatched by the warmth of the caterpillar's body and the heat of the sun the animal produced from it eats its way thereinto on that part whereby it adheres to the body The empty shell covering the entrance or incision made by the newly  hatched maggot the wound becomes quickly healed and the worm feeds on the entrails of the caterpillar till such time as he comes to his maturity which not being in less than eighteen or twenty days it frequently happens that the caterpillar becomes in the mean while transformed into a Chrysalis The maggot however contained either within the caterpillar or chrysalis when grown to its full bulk will eat its way through and fall to the ground at which time it is in size and shape as represented at  k  and of a dusky white but in less than two hours is formed into a Chrysalis as at  l  in which state if this change happens in summer it continues for only about three weeks but if late in autumn as is sometimes the case it remains during the whole winter in that state and the fly by eating its way through the shell comes forth in the spring following  N B All Caterpillars or Chrysales impregnated by Ichneumons become spoiled and do not produce any butterfly or moth There are great varieties of the Ichneumon fly but the one we have here described is of the kind called by Linnaeus Larvaxum  Description of the copper plate contained in our last Number  Figure    The Calamary compleat with all its arms extended Figure    and    Two of the suckers belonging to the long arms of the Calamary detached and represented in different views  THE LADY's GEOGRAPHY  The MANNERS and CUSTOMS of the Inhabitants of AMBOYNA concluded  THE People who were looked on as the Origines of these islands but which it is probable came thither from other countries were reckoned by the antient writers who however knew very little of them amongst the Anthropophagi or devourers of human flesh and indeed some recent examples seem to confirm that idea of them The grossness of their manners was perfectly correspondent with their simplicity and their ignorance which has however often been favourable to strangers still is apparent in the fabulous and absurd relation which the Amboynians themselves give in regard to their origin Some of them claim descent from a crocodile some from a serpent and others from an eel a tortoise or even the old trunk of a tree on which account they still respect their ancestors in the creature from whom they pretend to have sprung and if any one happens to kill one of these animals they consider themselves in duty bound to avenge their deaths  Ignorance in all ages the mother of idolatry and superstition has introduced into the worship and manner of living of these islanders an infinity of customs as whimsical as their prejudices are ridiculous Demons partake of their principal cares and are the continual objects of their inquietude The meeting of a dead body going to the grave or of a lame or old man if it happens to be the first live object seen in the day the cry of night birds or the flight of a crow over their houses are with them so many fatal presages whose effects they think themselves enabled to prevent by instantly returning back and making use of certain precautions A few cloves of garlic some little bits of pointed wood and a knife put into the hand or laid under the pillow of a child in the night time are by them imagined a sufficient security against evil spirits They never sell the first fish which they catch in new nets being well persuaded that it is unlucky so to do but either eat it themselves or else present it to some one The women who go to market in the morning with certain commodities always give the first piece for whatever price is offered them without which they imagine they should have no business for the whole day after also whenever they have sold any thing they immediately strike on their basket crying out as loud as they can "that's well"  It gives these people no kind of pleasure to commend their children for on these occasions they are always apprehensive of some design to bewitch them unless such commendations are joined with certain expressions which may dispel all kind of  diffidence When a child sneezes they make use of a sort of imprecation by way of conjuring the evil spirit which is waiting for its life and the least thing which ails a child they attribute to the power of witchcraft  These ideas are so deeply rooted among the people of this nation that it would be in vain to attempt destroying them Even those who have embraced christianity are not exempt from them although they are more circumspect on this head than the others They will not admit into a sick person's room any one who has been before where there was a corpse The women of the country will not eat a double pisang nor any other double fruit nor will a slave present her mistress with any such for fear that afterwards when she shall lie in she should bring twins into the world which would be an increase of domestic trouble  When a woman dies either pregnant or in childbed the Amboynians believe that she is changed into a daemon of which they tell stories as absurd as the precautions which they take on such occasions to prevent this imaginary misfortune Persons attacked by the small pox would according to them run a very great risk if not narrowly and closely watched of being carried away on a branch of sagu by the demon who communicated the distemper to them  In short it would be endless to enter into a detail of all the singular opinions of these people with respect to an infinity of other things but the most remarkable one and which shews what an imagination once led to a wrong biass is capable  of is the notion they have formed to themselves concerning their hair to which they attribute the hidden virtue of supporting a malefactor amidst the most cruel tortures without a possibility of forcing a confession of his crime unless by shaving him which never fails instantly to produce that effect  With so strong an inclination for superstition there can be no difficulty in conceiving that they should have a fondness for necromancy This science resides in certain particular families who are in high renown amongst them and although the rest hate them mortally because they look on them as capable of doing them a great goal of mischief yet they all have recourse to sorcery on every occasion where they think it can procure them any information which may favour their loves or aid any of their designs This vice reigns principally among the women who talk the most of it and who are also the most credulous but if their magic is more deeply examined it will be found that it most frequently consists only in the fatal art of subtilly preparing poison and that every thing also in it is no more than a texture of skilful impostures  Inconstancy and a love of novelty are the characteristics of this people in whom therefore there is no placing any great confidence The Dutch have frequently experienced the necessity of depriving them of the means of following their natural bent which incessantly leads them to form plots against them and execute them with as much steadiness as secrecy whenever they find a favourable opportunity  Too much severity however towards them would be equally dangerous sensible of injuries and vexations vindictive and implacable it is ever better to please them by fair than to enrage them by harsh treatment Such moderation therefore is ever strongly recommended in the instructions which the company sends to its officers and it were to be wished for their own sakes that they conformed thereto with more exactness than they generally do  DESCRIPTION of the Island of CEYLON  CEYLAN Ceilon or Zeilan is an island of Asia in the Indian sea on this side of the Ganges near the Cape of Comori upon the streight of Manar or Quiloa It lies in about six degrees of south latitude and near of longitude and is one of the most remarkable of these seas its length being according to the accounts of the Hollanders who have measured it the most exactly about fiftyfive leagues its greatest breadth about thirty and its whole circumference one hundred and ninety seven Its figure is nearly that of a pear or rather of a gammon of bacon for which reason the Dutch have given the fort Cays near Jaffanapatam the name of Hammenbiel or the Knuckle of the Gammon a name which is perfectly expressive of the form of the island in that place  The possession of this island lies between the Hollanders and the sovereign of the country which is called king of Candi or CandiUda The first European settlements that were made on it were by the Portuguese who not contented with the possession of part of the coast carried their incursions as far as to the capital which they burned more than once without sparing even the palaces or temples in short they rendered themselves so formidable that they obliged the king to pay them an annual tribute of three elephants and to purchase peace on many other servile conditions At length however that prince had recourse for assistance to the Dutch of Batavia who joining  their forces to his entirely beat the Portuguese and drove them out of all their fortified places after their having possessed them for near a hundred and fifty years The monarch however was little advantaged by this assistance which was only intended to procure a like establishment for themselves for the Dutch on the cOnclusion of the war and more especially after making themselves masters of Colombo in positively refused to give up a conquest which they thus saw themselves in the easy possession of ever since which time they have applied their whole care and diligence to fortify themselves on the coast Their principal establishments are at Jafnapatam and the island of Manaar on the north Trinquemali and Batticalon on the east the town of Point de Galla on the south and Colombo on the west To say nothing of Negombo and Calpentin which are two other towns belonging to them with several forts at the mouth of the rivers and the openings of mountains for the defence of passes so that the Dutch may properly be considered as absolute masters of much the greatest part of the coasts of this very extensive island  To be continued  THE LADY's MUSEUM  The TRIFLER NUMBER VII  MADAM  _ONE of your correspondents having given you a most entertaining account of the fair and unfortunate Bianca Capello give me leave to offer at your shrine some curious anecdotes of an Italian hero known by the name of Castruccio Castracani I shall draw my materials from Machiavel They begin I believe with a mixture of truth and romance Machiavel never keeping strictly in the road of truth when by going a little on one side of it he could embellish the history of his country In the main the facts are true  In the city of Lucca capital of the little republic of that name Dianora Castracani an unmarried  sister of Antonio Castracani one of the prebends of the cathedral of Lucca going one morning into her garden to gather herbs found secreted among some cabbages an infant boy who at her approach held out its helpless little hands and cried as wanting assistance Dianora was moved at the sight she took up the child and carried him into her brother's house The prebend no less humane than his sister approved of what she had done and resolving to preserve nourish and adopt this foundling immediately gave the child baptism by the name of Castruccio  Antonio and Dianora performed their different parts with equal care and attention in the culture of this young sapling which Antonio intended to plant in a proper season under the shade of the church Fate and Castruccio's own inclinations intended him for a more open situation At the age of fourteen arms were his exercise and books on military subjects his study The boy had discovered so many feats of courage among his playfellows and such an unwearied attention to all the exercises in which he saw the soldiers employed that he had attracted the particular observation of Francisco Guinigi a gentleman of great esteem and authority head of that party distinguished in Lucca by the title of the Ghibellins Guinigi sent for the boy and after having exactly learnt his story and education very generously offered to place him without any expence to himself or friends in the army Castruccio with great eagerness chose to mount a horse rather than ascend a pulpit he quitted the good priest Antonio Castracani  with all the decency of gratitude and enlisted into the Ghibellian troops with all the raptures of an Achilles His person his manners and particularly his modesty soon became extremely attractive He was not only agreeable to the family of Guinigi but to the whole people of Lucca He had scarce been three years in the army when in consequence of a treaty between the Lucchese and the Pavians the Guelfs of Pavia applied to the Ghibellins of Lucca for assistance which was granted by the latter notwithstanding former antipathies the Guelfs and Ghibellines having been long at variance Francisco Guinigi was appointed with the number of auxiliary troops in favour of the Pavians Among these squadrons marched Castruccio then only eighteen years old he distinguished himself in so remarkable a manner and reflected such glory and success upon his countrymen that at his return to Lucca he was received with the most unanimous applause and rewarded with honours seldom or ever bestowed upon so young an officer He was raised in the army and in the state to a rank equal with Uguccione della Fuggivola even his personal losses became to him fresh acquisitions of power his great patron and benefactor Francisco Guinigi died and left Castruccio tutor and sole director of the education and fortune of his only son Pagolo Guinigi A trust of such importance still exalted the character of Castruccio especially as his intentions of discharging it with honour and fidelity appeared in every step of his life  After the death of Francisco Guinigi whose authority had been incontestably great Georgio Opizi attempted to grasp the same same degree of power which Francisco had enjoyed in Lucca he was the head of a numerous family all of whom were Guelfs Uguccione jealous of the Opizi and most especially of Georgio was advised by Castruccio to destroy the whole race at once The manner of putting his scheme into execution was performed with equal secrecy and dispatch Castruccio remained at Lucca while Uguccione went to his government at Pisa but soon returned in the night time unsuspected to the gates of Lucca at the head of an army of Ghibellins whom he had brought from Pisa  Castruccio was ready at the time appointed to open the gates and in the slaughter of a few hours the entire race of the Opizi and great numbers of the chief Guelfs were put to the sword Not one of the Opizi survived but amidst the confusion and obscurity of the night about an hundred of the Guelf families escaped some of whom took refuge in Florence others in Pistoia  To this massacre for it will bear no softer a denomination succeeded La Battaglia de Monticatini the battle fought upon the banks of the Nievole Uguccione was hindered by illness from being personally present in the battle one of his sons was killed Castruccio was wounded and three hundred of the Lucchese army were left dead upon the field  Uguccione naturally jealous was now grown as uneasy at the established power of Castruccio  Castracani as he had been at the aspiring power of Georgio Opizi He saw the repeated victories of so young a general with envy He acquiesced to councils and pursued measures which he wished rather to have given than to have heard He had been taught by Castruccio himself that death was the only sure antidote against a rival  Morta la Serpe spento it veleno  The viper killed the poison evaporates  In pursuance of this maxim he sent a letter to his son Neri Uguccione to invite Castruccio to supper and there in defiance of all laws of hospitality and honour to take an opportunity to murder him Castruccio was invited accepted the invitation and in the midst of the festivity was manacled and confined as a prisoner but not murdered Neri Uguccione rightly judged that the forfeiture of his own life would be inherent to the destruction of so popular a man as Castruccio The father less considerate and more envious was resolved to perfect the bloody work which his son was unwilling to perform He came to Lucca with a considerable number of soldiers for that purpose At his arrival the whole people of Lucca rose in arms delivered Castruccio from his imprisonment and soon drove Uguccione out of Tuscany he took refuge in Lombardy where some years afterwards he died in little esteem and extremely poor  Uguccione being removed the whole field of honorary dignities lay open to Castruccio he was solemnly elected prince of Lucca and lord of Pisa he was scarce in possession of those titles when Frederic of Austria came into Italy where he was  received as emperor and in a personal interview with Castruccio appointed him his lieutenant in Tuscany  Castruccio equally courted by Tuscans Lombardians and Guibellins entertained hopes within his own breast of becoming entire master of the whole kingdom of Tuscany In pursuance of such intentions he resolved to seize upon Florence but while he was taking proper measures to fulfil these revolutions he was called back to Lucca on account of a conspiracy against him concerted by the family of Poggio  The several branches of the house of Poggio thought their merits ill rewarded by Castruccio to whose sovereignty they had zealously contributed Catching mutually fire from each other's indignation they took advantage of their prince's absence killed his lieutenant and were warmly inciting the whole state of Lucca to rebel when Stefano Poggio an old man of great worth and weight in his family who had kept himself free even from all thoughts of a conspiracy stopped any farther mischief and waited upon Castruccio to ask his pardon for what had already past Castruccio received him without any outward shew of resentment and having placed soldiers upon whom he might depend in every corner of the city he appointed a day when Stefano Poggio at the head of his relations should come to receive an act of grace The harmless unsuspicious old man being deceived himself deceived all his relations and attended with his whole family at the day and hour appointed They were admitted to Castruccio  they were sent by his immediate orders to prison and soon afterwards without any respect to age or regard to honour they were every one of them put to death  More effectually to secure himself in a government which he found capable of entertaining plots against him Castruccio under various pretences destroyed either the life or fortune of every individual Lucchese whom he suspected as his personal enemy and having pulled down many of their castles he turned the materials to his own service and built a fortress at Lucca in a situation to command and terrify the inhabitants As a farther security of his dominions he made a league of friendship with the Florentines for two years and then turned his thoughts towards Pistoia in which city he knew the old partydivisions distinguished by the names of Bianci and Neri were not totally extinguished With great accuteness he foresaw the consequences that must follow from those divisions and found himself courted by both parties separately and secretly from each other He gave them both assurances of his protection Bastianodi Possente was at the head of the Bianchi Jacopo da Gia at the head of the Neri To Jacopo he promised troops under his own conduct to Bastiano he promised troops under the conduct of Pagolo Guinigi whom he treated and loved as his son The troops of both commanders marched different ways and came into the town at different gates but at the same time the Pistoians of each party received them as friends Castruccio soon gave  the signal and while Guinigi cut in pieces the Bianchi Castruccio himself slaughtered the Neri Then as conquerors they seized the palace put themselves in possession of the signory quieted the populace and made Pistoia their own  Castruccio by his continued victories no matter how obtained was become the idol of worship to all the states of Italy he was entreated to come to Rome to pacify the people who were ready to mutiny for want of provisions Pope John the XXII was by the twenty seventh schism in the church at that time driven to Avignon and the emperor Lewis V was in possession of the city of Rome Castruccio hastened in person to the relief of the Romans and sent thither great quantities of corn from Pisa he calmed the mutiny made himself acceptable to the emperor and the nobility and was created a senator of Rome  The Florentines foreseeing their danger in the capture of a town so close to their territories as Pistoia seized it to themselves by the assistance and stratagems of several of the inhabitants who were glad to be delivered from the present yoke of their servitude and whom the Florentines by the power of money and promises had seduced to their own desires Such an action was scarce justifiable if the subsisting truce had been ratified to any other man less faithless ambitious or sanguinary than Castruccio but he was to be looked upon as a wolf and all the states of Italy as lambs destined to his voracity unless they could find a shepherd for their own security He hastened  back from amidst his honours at Rome and made preparations for a Florentine war The successes of that war were various sometimes the acquisitions were on one side sometimes on the other till in the year one great battle gave Castruccio a signal but in its consequence a dear bought victory As soon as the conquest was entirely compleated by the loss of twenty thousand Florentines and the flight of the rest their whole army having consisted of thirty thousand foot and ten thousand horse Castruccio placed himself in the gateway of the town of Fusechio the headquarters of his own residence to review his troops at their return and to take an opportunity of thanking the several soldiers and officers of his army as they passed by him into the town He was much heated and fatigued by the long and laborious combat and whilst he staid in the passage of the gate hot and exposed to a very sharp nipping wind he caught cold and the next night a fever confined him to his bed At first the symptoms were not dangerous but the distemper increasing by degrees quickly spread throughout his body and beyond the limits of medicinal power As soon as he found himself without the least hopes of recovery he called Pagolo Guinigi to his bed side and embracing him with the composure of a hero and the affection of a father made a very moving speech and took a last melancholy farewell of his pupil who had been the constant object of his care Castruccio died September No comments are requisite to illustrate  the life of such a man his actions are a continual comment upon themselves they represent him an active bloody remorseless soldier not unsusceptible to the calls of gratitude and friendship but vindictive to a degree that makes human nature almost tremble at his name  I am Madam Your Humble Servant E F  THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED  WHEN they arrived at Mrs Lawson's Sophia who little expected such a visit had wandered as usual in the wood accompanied with Dolly Mrs Lawson immediately sent Fanny in search of her and Harriot expressing an impatience to see her sister went along with her  They found Sophia sitting under an oak with Mrs Gibbons on one side of her and Dolly on the other for the old gentlewoman was prevailed upon by Sophia to endure the company of the innocent girl who had never offended her and Dolly instructed by her lovely friend made good use of these opportunities to insinuate herself into her favour  William leaned on a branch close by Sophia to whom he addressed his discourse while his eyes often stole tender glances at his beloved Dolly Harriot when she approached cried out affectedly  Upon my word sister you have a brilliant assembly  here I did not expect to find you in such good company  Sophia surprised to see her sister ran hastily to meet her and embracing her kindly enquired with a sweet anxiety for her mother and whether she also had been so good to visit her Harriot scarce answered her question her attention was all fixed upon William so handsome a youth seemed worthy to feel the influence of her charms and all the artillery of her eyes was instantly levelled against him Having returned his respectful bow with an affected courtesy and the fashionable toss of the head she deigned to take some little notice of Mrs Gibbons and honoured Dolly with a careless glance whose amiable figure however attracted a second look and after examining her with an inquisitive eye she turned away with a little expression of scorn in her countenance and again attacked William practising a thousand airs to strike him all which he beheld with the utmost indifference  Sophia being impatient to see her mother took leave of Mrs Gibbons but Harriot who had a new conquest in view was unwilling to go so soon professing herself inchanted with the place and declaring she would turn shepherdess  Sophia told her smiling that she was sure that that sort of life would not please her  Oh how can you think so cried Harriot is not the dress excessively becoming then love in these woods is so tender and sincere I will engage there is not a nymph in this hamlet whose frown would not drive her lover to despair  pair own the truth now said she turning with a lively air to William are you not violently in love  The youth bowed blushed and sighed and not daring to look at his mistress he suffered his eyes full as they were of tender expression to direct their glances towards Sophia  I am proud to own madam said he to Harriot that I have a heart capable of the most ardent passion  "And mighty constant too no doubt" interupted Harriot with a malignant sneer for she had observed the sigh and the look and was ready to burst with vexation and disappointment to find her conquest obstructed already by her sister as she supposed and being now as impatient as she was before unwilling to be gone  Come Sophy said she taking her under the arm my mamma will take it ill that you make no more haste to see her for we shall return to town immediately  "Sure you will stay one night" said Sophia  "Oh not for the world" exclaimed Harriot affectedly  How can you imagine I would stay so long in an odious village to be rusticated into aukwardness pursued she with a spiteful laugh and ashamed to shew my face in any assemby in town afterwards  Saying this she courtesied disdainfully to Mrs Gibbons and her nephew and tripped away pulling her sister away with her  Dolly joined the two ladies but walked by the side of Sophia not aiming at any familiarity with the insolent and affected Harriot and as they pursued their way home she had the mortification to  hear her lover ridiculed and despised by the disappointed coquet who supposed she mortified her sister by the contempt she expressed for a man who had so little taste as to like her  Sophia as well in compassion to poor Dolly who suffered greatly upon this occasion as in justice to the amiable youth defended him warmly which drew some coarse raillery upon her from Harriot  When they came near to Mr Lawson's house the sight of Sir Charles's chariot threw her into a fit of trembling Harriot perceived it and willing to undeceive her if she hoped to find the young baronet there  I am charged with Sir Charles's compliments to you said she he insisted upon our using his chariot for this little excursion my mamma and I would fain have persuaded him to accompany us but he pleaded an engagement and would not come  Dolly now looked with great concern upon her fair friend who suppressing a sigh asked if Sir Charles was quite recovered  I do not know that he has been ill replied Harriot Indeed when he came from Bath the fatigue he had endured with his sick uncle whom he had sat up with several nights before he died made him look a little pale and thin but he is now extremely well and more gay than ever and it is well he is so pursued she for we have so much of his company that if he was not entertaining we should find him very troublesome  All this was daggers to the heart of poor Sophia those pleasing ideas which she had indulged upon reading her mother's letter that represented Sir Charles as having suffered in his health from his endeavours to vanquish his passion for her all vanished and left in their room a sad conviction that she was become wholly indifferent to him  She might indeed knowing her sister's malice have attributed what she said to artifice but her manner of accounting for the alteration in Sir Charles's looks which her fond fancy had dwelt upon so much was so natural and so full of probability that she could suspect no artifice there  Every thing Harriot said was confirmed by facts which left no room for doubt his assiduity to Harriot his neglect of her appeared but too plain Did he not lend his chariot for a visit in which he would not share did he not send his compliments in a manner that shewed his heart was so much at ease that he felt not even any resentment for her leaving him could there be stronger proofs of indifference than these  Such were her thoughts and her heart was so oppressed by this sudden and unexpected shock that it was with difficulty she restrained her tears Dolly who looked at her with tender anxiety and saw her colour come and go and her charming eyes bent on the ground as if she feared to look up lest they should betray her anguish cast many an angry glance at her envious sister and wished her a thousand miles off  Sophia having a little recovered herself hastened towards her mother who with a face of ignorant  wonder was following Mrs Lawson about her little farm asking a thousand questions without heeding the answers she received Sophia approaching paid her duty to her with her usual tenderness and respect which Mrs Darnley returned with slightly kissing her cheek telling her that she thought her complexion was greatly improved and appealed to Harriot for the truth of her observation  Harriot answered  That indeed she could not flatter her sister so much as to say she thought so for if there was any alteration it was rather for the worse  Sophia without attending to this difference of opinion with regard to her complexion was only sollicitous to know if her mother had been well and while she was making some tender enquiries concerning her health Mrs Darnley who never consulted either time or place suddenly interupted her to draw her aside from the company and asked her abruptly  Whether she was not surprised at Sir Charles's indifference  Sophia still smarting with the pangs her sister's discourse had given her replied in a tone of resentment  That nothing now could surprise her with regard to Sir Charles  Why to say the truth Sophia replied Mrs Darnley I believe he has quite forgot you but there was a time when you might have been happyoh girl girl pursued she kindling with anger as she spoke you were always obstinate and conceited what a foolish part have you played with all your wit but I am to blame to trouble myself about you  Sophia now eased her loaded heart by a shower of tears  It is to little purpose now said Mrs Darnley to repent of your imprudent behaviour you were too wise to take a parent's advice when it might have been useful when a man of rank and fortune makes his addresses to a woman who is inferior to him in both he expects a thousand little complacencies and attentions from her which without wounding her honour may convince him that it is not to his riches she sacrifices herself  Ah Madam cried Sophia that is a snare which has been fatal to many young women in my circumstances Who sees not the advantages this gives a man whose aim is to seduce I am persuaded these pernicious maxims are not yours but his for whose ungenerous purpose they are so well calculated  Sophia guessed truly the young baronet had often had discourses of this sort with Mrs Darnley who nevertheless took it ill that her daughter should offer her such an affront as to suppose she did not understand maxims as well as Sir Charles  Nothing is more certain than that we are never made so ridiculous by the qualities we have as by those we affect to have Mrs Darnley with all her ignorance aspired to be thought witty she therefore vindicated her claim to what Sophia had called maxims no matter whether they were pernicious or not The word maxim sounded learnedly in her ears she told her daughter with great asperity that she was so conceited and vain of her  own wit that she would allow no one else to have any Sophia found it difficult enough to appease her but she succeeded at length and they joined the rest of the company  Mrs Lawson easily prevailed upon her guests to stay that night and the following day which being Sunday Harriot could not resist the temptation of displaying her charms and her fine cloaths in a country church which was so new a triumph that the thoughts of it kept her waking almost the whole night  The ridiculous airs she assumed to draw the admiration of the simple villagers who never saw any thing so fine and so gay before and who stared at her with stupid surprise made Sophia often blush for her but her affected glances were chiefly directed to the beautiful youth whose insensibility had so greatly mortified her pride she saw his eyes constantly turned towards the pew where she sat but she saw plainly that it was not her charms that drew them thither She had no suspicion that Dolly was the object of his affection and sensible to her great grief of her sister's power to charm she no longer doubted that this envied conquest was hers  Thus disappointed she appeared so much out of humour and so impatient to return to town that Mrs Darnley over whom her power was absolute complied with her importunity and set out with her for London as soon as they returned from church notwithstanding all the endeavours of the good curate and his wife to detain them to dinner  Sophia was now left alone to her own melancholy reflections this visit from her mother and sister had produced a sad reverse in her situation hitherto hope had not quite forsaken her the idea of being still beloved by Sir Charles lessened all her griefs and supported her amidst the doubt and anxiety which his mysterious conduct had involved her in his indifference so apparent in her sister's account of him gave her pangs unfelt before and never till now did she think herself unhappy for unperceived by herself she had encouraged a secret hope that the passion she had inspired him with would not be easily subdued and that perhaps all which she had thought exceptionable in his conduct proceeded not from a settled design to the prejudice of her honour but from that irresolution and slowness with which a man too sensible of his superiority in birth and fortune proceeds in an affair of marriage where he has no obstacles to fear and where every thing depends upon himself  She now perceived the necessity of banishing Sir Charles from her heart but at the same time she perceived all the difficulty of the task Though ashamed of her tears she wept and passionately exclaimed against her own weakness which had kept her in a delusion so fatal to her peace She continued the whole day in her chamber wholly absorb'd in melancholy thoughts  Dolly who knew enough of her situation to guess the cause of this new affliction was grieved to find herself excluded as well as the rest of the family and although she ardently wished to console  her yet she durst not intrude uncalled upon her retirement While she waited impatiently for her appearance a visitor arrived who she knew would be welcome to her charming friend As soon as she perceived him she flew with eager haste to inform Sophia and tapping at her door told her in a joyful voice that Mr Herbert was just alighted  Sophia surprised at the news instantly opened her chamberdoor and smiling tenderly upon the charming girl to whom she excused herself for her long absence hastened to receive the good old man who after some affectionate enquiries concerning her health rallied her upon the melancholy that appeared in her countenance  Sophia blushed and fixed her eyes on the ground not a little surprised at his talking to her in that manner and when with a bashful air she looked up again and saw a more than usual chearfulness in his eyes her confusion encreased and for a few moments she could not help feeling some resentment against her benefactor for thus diverting himself with her uneasiness  Mr Herbert whose thoughts were wholly employed on the pleasing news he brought did not perceive how much his behaviour embarrassed her to prevent his renewing a subject so disagreeable she talked of the visit her mother and sister had made her  Mr Herbert asked her  If they had mentioned Sir Charles and what she thought of him now  I think of him as I ought to do replied Sophia with some warmth I despise him  Be not too rash my dear child said Mr Herbert if your sister whose malice I well know has suggested any thing to Sir Charles's disadvantage be assured she deceives you for I am convinced he not only loves you but loves you with honour  Sophia who from the first words Mr Herbert uttered had been in great agitation as expecting something extraordinary was so overwhelmed with surprise at what she heard that her speech and colour forsaking her she remained pale silent and motionless in her chair  Mr Herbert perceiving how powerfully this news operated on her spirits began to be apprehensive of the consequences and was rising hastily to give her some assistance when Sophia rouzed to recollection by this motion of her venerable friend and ashamed of the extreme sensibility she had discovered apologised for it with a charming modesty that greatly affected the good old man who if he had known in what melancholy thoughts she had passed the day would have told her with more caution a circumstance that raised her at once from despair to hope and produced so great a change in her situation  As we are never so ready to fear a disappointment as when we are nearest the completion of our wishes Sophia with a sweet apprehensiveness which yet she laboured to conceal hinted her doubts of the baronet's sincerity Mr Herbert answering explicitly to these half expressed doubts  told her that he was fully persuaded Sir Charles would act like a man of honour "I will give you an exact account said he to her of what has passed between us from which you may judge yourself of his conduct" he then took a letter out of his pocket and desired her to read it  Sophia trembling a little at the sight of Sir Charles's hand writing took the billet and found it contained a message from him to Mr Herbert requesting in very earnest terms the favour of an interview and an offer to wait upon him at any hour he should appoint  You may be sure said Mr Herbert receiving back the billet which Sophia gave him without speaking a word that I did not suffer Sir Charles to come to me hearing from the messenger that his master was at home waiting for my answer I attended him immediately I perceived a little embarrassment in his countenance upon my first entrance but that soon wore off he welcomed me with great politeness and after thanking me for the honour I did him in preventing his visit he entered immediately upon the affair which had occasioned his sending to me  You have Sir said he shewn so truly a paternal affection for the young lady to whom I have paid my addresses and are so much esteemed and reverenced by her that I think I may without any impropriety address myself to you upon this occasion  Here he paused and seemed a little perplexed  To be sure added he I ought to have done this before my conduct must have appeared capricious  both to her and you and indeed it was capriciousbut  Here he paused again and fixed his eyes on the ground "His frankness pursued Mr Herbert pleased me greatly and disposed me to give him a favourable attention"  I cannot blame Miss Sophia said he for acting as she has done my heart did homage to her virtue at the time that I suffered most from the contemptuous behaviour it suggested to her Fain would I hope added he sighing that the prejudices she has conceived against me has not entirely banished me from her remembrance the delicacy of my passion would be but ill satissfied by calling so deserving a woman my own unless I could likewise boast a preference in her heart that left me no room to doubt my fortune had any share in determining her in my favour  "I know not pursued Mr Herbert whether Sir Charles expected any answer to this declaration it is certain he looked on me with a kind of anxious timidity and stopped a moment I continued silent and he proceeded in this manner"  I know Miss Sophia has an understanding too solid and a mind too noble to suffer any considerations of rank and fortune to determine her solely in an affair upon which the happiness of her life depends she would not surely give her hand where her heart did not acknowledge a preference 'Tis thus I answer all those doubts which my situation and perhaps an overstrained delicacy suggest I am impatient to convince her of the purity of my passion and considering you as her friend her  guardian and one who is in the place of a father to her I will take no steps in this affair but such as have the sanction of your approbation I will not even presume to visit her without your permission be you my advocate with her tell her I lay myself and fortune at her feet and will receive her from your hand as the greatest blessing that heaven can bestow on me  Now my child pursued Mr Herbert looking on Sophia with a smile how would you have me answer to this discourse was it necessary think you to play off a few female artifices here and keep Sir Charles in doubt and anxious suspence or did the apparent openness and candor of his procedure deserve an equal degree of frankness on my part  It is not to be doubted sir said Sophia blushing but that on this occasion as on every other you acted with the utmost prudence  I find resumed Mr Herbert that you are resolved beforehand to approve of whatever I said well then I told Sir Charles that his present declaration entirely satisfied me that being fully convinced of his sincerity I looked upon his offer as highly honourable and advantageous to you and that I was very sure you would have all the sense you ought to have of so generous an affection  He then begged me to set out immediately for this place and prepare you to receive a visit from him This request I could not possibly comply with having business in town which would necessarily detain me for some hours but I promised him to go as soon as that was dispatched which probably might be in the afternoon  He modestly asked my leave to accompany me but this I declined as fearing his sudden appearance without your being previously acquainted with what had past might occasion some perplexity and uneasiness to you so it was agreed that he should come tomorrow  "Tomorrow" replied Sophia with an emotion she was not able to suppress  Yes my child replied the good old man have you any objections to this  I know not replied Sophia with downcast eyes and a faultering accent what I ought to do I have been so used to consider Sir Charles's professions in an unfavourable point of view my heart has been so accustomed to suspect himto guard itself against delusive hopes perhaps I ought not to admit his visit so easily perhaps I ought to resent his former behaviour I own I am greatly perplexed but I will be determined wholly by your advice  Mr Herbert saw her delicate scruples and to favour her modesty answered with the authority of a guardian  When Sir Charles visits you next Miss Sophia he comes to offer you his hand he has asked my consent as your guardian and your friend and I presuming on my influence over you in both those characters have given it freely and how indeed having your interest and happiness sincerely at heart could I do otherwise but if you think his former behaviour in which however there were only suspicions against him deserves to be resented at a time when those suspicions are absolutely destroyed you must go  through with your heroism and see him no more for as the poet says  He comes too near who comes to be denied  so he has offended too much who needs a pardon  Sophia who felt all the force of this reasoning answered only by a blushing silence Mr Herbert then told her that Sir Charles had declared to him that he would make the same settlements on her as had been stipulated for his mother for he added with equal delicacy and tenderness  Miss Sophia in virtue wit good sense and every female excellence brings me an immense portion  "Sir Charles pursued Mr Herbert smiling by a strange contradiction which is I suppose always found in lovers though he was impatient to have me with you yet could not help detaining me to have the pleasure of talking of you he painted to me very naturally the uneasiness he had suffered from your supposed contempt of him he told me that he was at one time determined to travel in order to efface you from his remembrance"  But said he rising and unlocking a cabinet from which he took out a paper and put into my hands you shall judge whether amidst all my resentment I did not still love Miss Sophia that is my will which I ordered to be drawn up previous to my intended journey  "He then to spare me the trouble of reading it all through pointed to the place where you was mentioned and I found he had bequeathed you an estate of four hundred pounds a year for life and five thousand pounds to be disposed of as you pleased"  This last circumstance touched Sophia so much that tears filled her eyes she sighed and turned her head aside to conceal her emotion while Mr Herbert without seeming to observe it continued to repeat to her several expressions used by Sir Charles which shewed the greatness of his affection and his veneration for her virtues  We parted at length pursued Mr Herbert extremely well satisfied with each other and tomorrow or next day at farthest you may expect to see Sir Charles here for he told me that if he received no ill news from me he would conclude I had prepared him a favourable reception and presuming on this hope he would immediately set his lawyer to work to prepare the writings that nothing might be left undone which could convince you of the sincerity of his affections therefore my dear child set your heart at rest and since providence has thought fit to reward your piety and virtue receive with humble gratitude that fortune to which you are raised and which puts it so largely in your power to do good I will now leave you said the good old man rising to your own reflections I have scarce spoke a word yet to our kind friends here for I was so impatient to see you that I left them very abruptly  Mr Herbert had no sooner left the room than Sophia in an ardent ejaculation thanked heaven for thus relieving her from her distress but it was long ere the tumult in her mind raised by such unhoped for happy news subsided and gave place to that calm recollection which supplied a thousand  pleasing ideas and filled her with the softest emotions of gratitude tenderness and joy  She was now freed from those tormenting doubts which made her consider her tenderness for Sir Charles as a crime and occasioned so many painful struggles in her mind What joy to reflect that the man she loved was worthy of her affection how pleasing was the prospect that opened to her view to be blest with the power of shewing her gratitude to her friends her piety to her mother to repay her sister's unkindness with acts of generosity and indulge the benevolence of her heart in relieving every distress which fell within her power to relieve  These were the advantages which she promised herself in the change of her fortune and for these her grateful heart lifted itself up every moment in thanks and praise to that providence that bestowed them on her  While Sophia was thus absorb'd in thought Dolly opened the door and running up to her eagerly cried  Tell me true my dear miss has not Mr Herbert brought you some good news I am sure he has I never saw him so joyful in my life and you look glad too  pursued she peering in her face with a sweet earnestness  May I not ask you Miss Darnley what this good news is  You may my dear said Sophia smiling but not now you shall know all soon At present I would rather talk of your affairs  Indeed I am greatly obliged to you miss said Dolly for what you have done for me Mrs  Gibbons seems almost as kind to me as ever she was and you have talked so sensibly to my mother that she repents of her behaviour to Mrs Gibbons and she likes Mr William so well that I am sure she would be glad to be reconciled to her  That is what I have been labouring at all this time resumed Sophia If Mrs Lawson can be persuaded to make some concessions to the fantastick old gentlewoman all may go well yet it shall be my care to bring them together and if my endeavours to produce a reconciliation fail perhaps I may be able to engage a more powerful mediator in your interest  Sophia had Sir Charles in her thoughts who she doubted not would readily undertake the cause of the distressed lovers and possibly add something to her Dolly's portion to lessen the inequality there was between them in that point She spoke with such a chearful confidence that Dolly full of hope and joy thanked her with artless transports of gratitude that moved her even to tears  The next day though in expectation of seeing Sir Charles her heart laboured with a thousand emotions yet kindly attentive to the affairs of her friend she resolved to make Mrs Gibbons a visit to prepare the way for the hoped for interview between her and Mrs Lawson As soon as she had disengaged herself from Mr Herbert she set out alone for Mrs Gibbons's house but scarcely had she crossed the first field when she saw William who was as usual sauntering about Mr Lawson's grounds in hopes of seeing his mistress  Sophia beckoned to him and he flew to meet her for next to Dolly he thought her the most charming woman in the world and he adored her for the goodness with which she interested herself in his and his Dolly's happiness  When he drew near Sophia told him she was going to visit his aunt the youth respectfully expressed his concern that his aunt could not have that honour she was gone he said to visit a relation who lived a few miles up the country  Sophia then told him the design upon which she was going and the favourable disposition Mrs Lawson was in  I am persuaded said she all might be made up if we could but bring them together Mrs Lawson only wants an opportunity to repair her fault but how shall we contrive to give her this opportunity what expedient can we find out to overcome your aunt's obstinacy and prevail upon her to enter Mrs Lawson's door again  I know one madam said the youth smiling which I think would do  Sophia concluding from the timidity of his look that she was concerned in this expedient prest him to speak freely assuring him she would assist to the utmost of her power  My aunt madam said he is as you know a great observer of forms she would not for the world fall under the censure of having failed in any part of ceremony or good breeding now madam if you would be pleased to make a point of her returning your visit and permit me to tell her that you are offended with her neglect  and that you insist upon this proof of her politeness I am persuaded she will come  Well said Sophia smiling if you are of opinion this will do you have my consent to say whatever you think will affect her most make me as angry and as ceremonious as you please  Nothing shall be wanting on my part to promote the success of this affair added she with a graver look and accent for I believe you have a sincere affection for my young friend and I shall not be at rest till I see you both happy  The youth in whose breast the sweet benevolence of her looks and words excited the strongest transports of gratitude not able to find words to express his sense of her goodness suddenly threw himself at her feet and kissed her hand with a mixture of tenderness and awe  Sophia smiling at this sally stepped back a little upon which he rose up and with a graceful confusion paid her his thanks she again repeated her promise of serving him and took leave he bowed low following her for some time with his eyes and sent a thousand kind wishes after her  Sophia at her return acquainted Dolly with what had passed between her lover and her and filled her with pleasing hopes of the success of his scheme but now the day wore away she was in continual expectation of seeing Sir Charles her heart throbbed with anxiety every noise she heard sounded like the trampling of horses and then a universal trembling would seize her She dreaded yet wished for his arrival and at every disappointment  she sighed and felt her heart sink with tender despondency  Such were her agitations till the evening being far advanced she gave up all hope of his coming that night Mr Herbert had assigned a very pleasing reason for his visit being deferred till the next day and her mind growing more composed she went in search of the good old man who Dolly told her was gone to walk in the meadows behind the house for she had kept herself out of his sight as much as possible unwilling that he should observe her emotions She saw him at a distance walking with a slow pace and she perceived he saw her but to her great surprise she saw him cross into another field and take a quite contrary way on purpose to avoid her  Struck with this little accident she stood still and paused a few moments she felt herself strangely alarmed yet wondered why she should be so and took her way back again to the house with sad forebodings on her mind  To be continued  BRITANNIA SAXONICA  ESSAY ON THE Original Inhabitants of GREAT BRITAIN CONTINUED  IMmediately upon the marriage of Vortigern with the daughter of Hengist great numbers of the northern nations under the inclusive title of Saxons hastened over to Britain and the Britons received and paid them as confederates Vortigern by the persuasion of his fatherinlaw assigned Northumberland for their residence As their numbers increased the payment of such fresh supplies grew burdensome to the Britons They desired the Saxons to depart and alledged that they were not able to maintain so many more troops than were stipulated by treaty or were necessary for defence The Saxons relished their present situation too well to exchange it they refused to return so that the Britons were compelled to rouze themselves from every symptom of lethargy and to assume that glorious spirit of liberty which whenever exerted in a proper manner renders the British nation a powerful and a happy people They unanimously rose up in arms against the Saxons who were joined by the Scots and Picts Many battles were fought and great numbers of men were destroyed woods were burnt churches  were demolished and whole cities were depopulated At length many of the Saxons returned into Germany Their return was owing to the warm reception which they met with from our ancestors The Britons might be plundered but could not be absolutely conquered they might be forced or betrayed into slavery but they had native strength sufficient soon to unshackle themselves and to burst forth again into the plains of liberty The Britons as a national body or as individual men seldom failed to appear with remarkable lustre under misfortunes and oppressions In milder times they were either totally inactive or impoliticly employed in disputes and animosities among themselves They were naturally honest indolent and unsuspicious too easily captivated with strangers too hasty and irresolute and consequently too easily led into danger and disasters These were some of their earliest and these will probably be some of their latest characteristics  Nothing farther can be said with certainty the latter end of Vortigern's reign is much obscured amidst fables and idle tales he is generally described as a man much abandoned to his vices  His son Vortimer is supposed to have deposed his father or at least to have commanded the Britons against Hengist Vortigern and the Saxons he is represented as a prince of a more amiable character than Vortigern He died before his father and after his death Vortigern reassumed the reins of government and became again one of the chief monarchs of Britain Hengist still remained king of Kent  Vortigern was very unacceptable to his subjects he shewed too great favour and partiality to the Saxons who by their cruelties had rendered themselves exceedingly terrible and odious Vortigern finding himself uneasy on his throne retired with his family into Wales and was buried at a place in Caernarvonshire which still bears the name of Vortigern's Grave  Where some years ago was found a stone chest with the corpse of a very tall man enclosed says Mr Carte    The clouds of history are no where more obscure than at this period The antient historians have mixed their narratives with legendary stories the modern writers have been at the pains to mention those stories the history is swelled but the instruction from it is not encreased The uncertainty of chronology is another most discouraging circumstance the chronologists differ very widely from each other Every author who treats of those times fills his bucket as he imagines from the purest fountains but tacitly endeavours to draw up some water from a different stream than any that has been discovered by his cotemporaries or his predecessors  Here it may not be improper to remind ourselves of the civil government that still subsisted among the Britons since that government will soon be changed into another form  The whole nation as by the original constitution was still divided into principalities The principalities were very small the head of each little colony was honoured sometimes not always with the pompous title of a king  Several of these princes had been lately driven out of the kingdom by the outrages of the Saxons and had been attended by great numbers of their subjects into Armorica  Bretaigne a province of France  They were received and protected by Aldroen king of that country but as soon as they heard that the majority of Saxons were departed towards Germany many of the British princes again attended by their subjects came back and settled themselves in the districts which they had formerly governed Ambrosuis Aurelianus was of the number of those who returned He was king of Wiltshire and his chief residence was called  Urbs Ambrosii  the name of the place Amesbury is still in a great measure retained He was a young prince of Roman descent and of a most excellent character warlike modest and amiable As some period must be affixt to his reign although the beginning and end of it are both very uncertain let us suppose from various small glimmerings if they even may be called glimmerings of probability that it began in the year and ended in the year In this space of fortythree years the general historical records entirely consist of different battles and sieges between our ancestors and the Saxons who had left Britain fully determined to return to a more effectual purpose  The methods which the Saxons took to effect their views of conquest were gradual From the year Hengist bore the title of king of Kent  he reigned upwards of thirty years and died after various struggles with the Britons in peaceful possession of his throne He was succeeded by his son Esca and from him sprung a line of kings amounting Hengist included to seventeen The last of the kings of Kent was Baldred he was driven out by Egbert in the year  The Saxons who had been settled in Northumberland or dispersed in other parts of the kingdom received continual accessions of strength by the arrival of their countrymen from Germany These additional troops of supply came in small numbers but they came often till by degrees the most eminent chieftains appeared and with them whole armies of followers and dependants  Such was Ella a Saxon of great power and dignity among his countrymen He brought with him his two sons and a very considerable force He landed in Sussex in the year and after much opposition from the Britons he conquered Sussex and a great part of Surry He did not assume the title of king during the life of Hengist from whom he probably received great assistance in his conquests He died in the year after a reign of twentyfour years His territories were called the kingdom of the South Saxons  The third and next monarchy formed by these invaders was the kingdom of the WestSaxons The first of the West Saxon kings was Cerdic he landed in the year From the very day on which he landed till the year he was at war with the Britons In these battles the success was  various and the loss on each side considerable but Cerdic was constantly reinforced by fresh recruits from Germany The Britons who had no such advantages were at last so effectually conquered that Cerdic became possessed of a great part of Cornwall and entirely of Devonshire Dorsetshire Wiltshire Somersetshire Hampshire and Berkshire He died in the year and was succeeded by his son Cenric The WestSaxon kings were in number seventeen the last of whom became sole monarch of Britain  The fourth kingdom of the heptarchy was that of the EastSaxons The first monarch of that kingdom was Erkenwin He began his reign in the year he died in the year His territories were Essex Middlesex and part of Hertfordshire  Northumberland was the fifth kingdom of the heptarchy It contained Lancashire Yorkshire the bishopric of Durham Cumberland Westmorland Northumberland and part of Scotland as far as the frith of Edinburgh Ida was the first Saxon king of these provinces He began his reign in the year and died in the year After his death the kingdom of Northumberland was otherwise divided  The sixth was the kingdom of the EastAngles It contained Norfolk Suffolk Cambridgeshire and the isle of Ely Uffa the first monarch began his reign in the year he died in the year This kingdom was united to Mercia in the year  Mercia was the seventh and the largest division of the Saxon heptarchy It contained Gloucestershire Herefordshire Worcestershire Warwickshire Leicestershire Rutlandshire Northamptonshire Lincolnshire Huntingdonshire Bedfordshire Buckinghamshire Oxfordshire Staffordshire Shropshire Nottinghamshire Cheshire and part of Hertfordshire Cridda the first king began his reign in the year and died in The fate of these several kingdoms needs not to be particularised let us return to take a review of the Britons under the reign of Ambrosius  Many of our historians are of opinion that Ambrosius is the same person as Natanleod who is represented by the antient writers as the greatest of the British kings In that point the description answers the dignity of Ambrosius who whilst he lived defended his territories with great magnanimity and often with success  Natanleod was slain in a battle fought against the Saxons near Charford in Hampshire when five thousand Britons were left dead upon the field  But what shall be said of king Arthur or at what time shall we suppose that he reigned since his very existence itself is call'd in question and since he has unfortunately been celebrated by so many fabulous writers that his true history can never be known That he existed is beyond all doubt and that he reigned is a point which many authors have sufficiently proved but the actions of this prince although in themselves brave and glorious are so outrageously magnified that the  real soldier is lost in the fictitious giantkiller and the genuine and noble form of the hero is so utterly dissolved that from a substance it becomes a shadow I will endeavour to extract if possible some gold from amidst the historical dross of these times Probability must be my best assistant in the search  Arthur was nearly related to Ambrosius Aurelianus perhaps directly descended from him The beginning of Arthur's reign is assigned to the year His coronation to the year His victories over the Saxons are supposed to have been twelve in number but the Saxons had already fixed themselves too deeply in our island to be rooted out by the strongest hand nor was Arthur always victorious otherwise he would scarce have yielded up by a treaty with Cerdic the counties of Somerset and Southampton  Hampshire  a cession which gave the West Saxons such great power and such easy opportunities of encreasing their dominions that in length of time they absorb'd the rest of the heptarchy and terminated the entire monarchy of Britain in their own sovereign king Egbert  Arthur was a native of South Wales his memory has been ever held in particular veneration by the Welch One of the highest mountains in Brecnockshire is called Arthur's chair  Cadair Arthur  in honour of a prince who was remarkable preeminent The first part of his life was prosperous the latter end of it was unfortunate During an expedition to the northern parts of the kingdom where he was summoned to assist the Britons against the Saxons he left his patrimonial dominions which were  Cornwall Devonshire and Dorsetshire to the government and care of his nephew Mordred who proved unfaithful to his trust and possessed himself of the throne Arthur returned into Cornwall attended by a numerous army an engagement ensued Mordred was killed in the field of battle Arthur was desperately wounded and died soon afterwards at the age of ninety years seventysix of which he had exercised in war He was buried at Glastenbury in Somersetshire and with him was interred the glory of the Britons Arthur's death is fixed by all authors in the year  As I have mentioned the Welch it may not be improper in this place to give some short account of a people who have constantly held themselves in a kind of separate and distinct state from the rest of the Britons In the time of the Romans the inhabitants of North Wales were called Ordovices and those of South Wales were called Silures  The counties of North Wales are Montgomeryshire Merionethshire Denbighshire Flintshire Carnarvonshire and the isle of Anglesey  The counties of South Wales are Monmouthshire Brecknockshire Carmarthenshire Glamorganshire Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire  The inhabitants of the forest of Dean and of Herefordshire were also called Silures and those of Shropshire were reckoned among the Ordovices  The Welch or Cambrians were never entirely conquered They had the same advantage as the Caledonians When they found themselves too hard pressed they retired within their mountains and were safe They were of more generous and  less rapacious dispositions than the Scots they were an high spirited people easily provoked and very sharp in resentment they were hardy like all mountaineers well made and robust in their persons they were proud not vain fiery not cruel they married within their own tribes and therefore are justly looked upon even to this day as the truest and most ancient Britons The Ordovices remained longer than the Silures in the state of a commonwealth independant of any single sovereign but the whole kingdom of Cambria had certainly submitted to a regal government long before the arrival of the Saxons and even before the departure of the Romans Their sovereigns were all chosen by the people but in what manner I believe cannot easily be known and although their names may be enrolled in the records of Wales their particular histories would be tedious and to no purpose In the choice of Arthur the Britons were entirely unanimous he was an honour to the country where he was born and a defence to the territories where he resided  From the departure of the Romans to the settlement of the Saxons Christianity by degrees and at different periods had made a considerable progress into various parts of Britain The first step and certainly a very wise one was the establishment of schools in which the Britons in their earliest time of life were taught the doctrines of religion and the principles of moral virtues From such seeds alone must spring every flourishing branch of civil government and order A school under the conduct and care of Dubricius is mentioned  as one of considerable note in those times Dubricius was a most religious man of great abilities and of indefatigable industry He was first made bishop of Landaff and was translated from thence in the year by the authority of a synod to the archbishoprick of Kaerleon or Chester I mention this circumstance only to shew that the Christian church was then so well established in Britain as to be divided into sees and it will be found upon looking into the voluminous historians of our nation that monasteries had been erected synods had been held and even heresies particularly those of Arian and Pelagius had prevailed in Britain long before the perfection of the heptarchy By the perfection I mean the division of the kingdom into seven Saxon monarchies  To give an history of the church or to enter minutely into the ecclesiastical government would be a laborious and a very unprofitable undertaking neither suitable to the intent of these papers nor available in any material point whatever To our happiness and to our honour be it spoken we have long ago thrown off the yoke of Rome we have discovered her pretended miracles and we have despised her idolatrous vanities The memorials of her errors need not be minutely specified unless when they are connected or interwoven with the systems of the state  The Saxons were descended from those Germans who are often mentioned by Caesar and fully described by Tacitus and who appeared under the denomination of Goths and Vandals titles dreadful to learning and all the civil arts of peace  they were a rude robust warlike people and subsisted under a kind of government to which it would be difficult to appropriate any general name It was neither oligarchy monarchy democracy nor commonwealth Tacitus in his account of the Germans says  De minoribus rebus principes consultant de majoribus omnes Ita tamen ut ea quoque quorum penes plebem arbitrium est apud principes pertractentur  The chieftains debated solely upon matters of little consequence in matters of importance all the people were consulted but in such a manner that whatever was left to the decision of the people had first been digested by the chieftants  A little farther the same historian tells us  Nihil autem neque publicae neque privatae rei nisi armati agunt  They never transact any business either of a public or a private nature unless they are armed  Such were the aborigines of the Saxons and from them is derived our Gothic custom of wearing swords in all public places and in all visits of ceremony even to our nearest friends and relations  Whatever system of government might have prevailed among these northern nations while they remained upon the continent they were wise enough to perceive that the regal state was most natural and agreeable to the disposition of the Britons The first step of Hengist was to make himself king Six other Saxon chieftains whose names I have already mentioned followed his example The Britons fought often and fought bravely in defence of their rights and privileges particularly the liberty of chusing their  own kings they were overpowered by numbers and time often the best friend to conquest inured them to Saxon monarchs and to Saxon laws Their own customs were forgotten and the customs and religion of the conquerors were received They even lost their name and from the Angles will be called English as long as the nation shall subsist  The Saxons apparently laid the foundation of that mighty pillar of our state a parliament at least the basis of it seems to have been built upon the Saxon WittenaGemot The column indeed has since been formed and fluted with all the power and skill of architecture and when a sovereign is properly placed upon the capital the justness of the several parts and the exactness and beauty of the proportions will be universally admired except by those who think the king a superficial ornament The WittenaGemot of the Saxons was an assembly in which all public and private business was transacted Leagues of alliance and affinity with other nations were there determinately passed inconveniencies were remedied and rights were established and sanctified by law The assembly was composed of king lords and freemen The debates were concluded by votes and the numbers were determined by voices unless when the noise was doubtful and the majority uncertain in that case the votes were taken severally  In the year Augustine the monk since known by the name of St Austin was peremptorily sent into England by Pope Gregory the first to convert the Saxons from Paganism to Christianity  he was attended by a company of Missionaries his brethren of whom he was the chief they landed in the isle of Thanet and soon afterwards proceeded to Canterbury where king Ethelbert and his court then resided They were received favourably by the king a part of the city of Canterbury was assigned for their habitation and they were permitted to preach the gospel throughout the dominion of Kent Augustine had undertaken the journey unwillingly he had once absolutely refused it and had returned back to Rome frightened at the terrible accounts which were given of our ancestors Gregory who had undoubted assurances that the English were ready to embrace Christianity spirited up the timorous monk to pursue his intended journey and the event proved so successful that before the end of the year more than ten thousand English were converted Among these was Ethelbert king of Kent who was looked upon as the superior king of the Saxons In his conversion he was probably influenced by his queen Bertha a princess of great piety a daughter of France and perhaps the only daughter of France who was ever of real advantage to England  From this period Christianity which had been much repulsed and damped since the arrival of the Saxons began to shine out sometimes in greater and at other times in lesser degrees of lustre Many of the Saxon kings were zealous christians their sons and successors often returned to paganism But the indefatigable industry of the Romish priests the dexterity with which they performed their miracles the natural enthusiasm  doubts and timid disposition of mankind were all circumstances that tended not indeed to introduce the doctrines of Christ but to establish and encrease the power of the pope and to inculcate an implicit submission to priests of every degree and order and most especially to monks It pleases God to permit us to worship him in all the errors and infirmities of our nature such is his will and his will be done  From the arrival of St Augustine to the end of the heptarchy by the establishment of a single monarch over the whole kingdom of England is a space of about two hundred and thirty years Throughout that period we might expect to find many remarkable events in a monarchy consisting of seven royal branches but scarce any part of the English history is more sapless and unfruitful The scenes which heretofore represented civil wars between the native Britons were now only changed into civil wars between those Britons and the engrafted Saxons The ambition and restlessness of the several kings prevented an union in the general system of government Each monarch strove to extend his territories and to enlarge his rights We are at a loss to know in what particulars these rights consisted If from the materials of history that remain to us we can form any exact notion of the rules of policy by which the heptarchy was guided we may conclude that one of the seven monarchs was superior to the rest a kind of president to the regal council All matters of importance or relative to private property were to be laid before him but each of the other kings  had an equal right of choice in every single transaction that required approbation or dissent The principal members of the WittenaGemot had no less a right of giving their voices in points where the general welfare of the nation was included This seems to have been the Saxon form of government and it is easy to suppose that the different prerogatives not only of the several kings but of the individual members who composed the assembly might often clash and give continual occasions for those feuds and contests which are the principal records that occur to us in all accounts of the heptarchy  To be continued  THE HISTORY OF BIANCA CAPELLO CONCLUDED  THE furious Buonaventuri would not let her go on but starting up and running to her in a fury said  Go hang yourself and then howl to those that will hear you in the other world in this I'll follow my own way therefore do not pretend to whine to me but take care of yourself who are in more danger for do you think strumpet that I won't cut off that golden horn which you have placed on my head by stopping your windpipe with a knife one day or other  In the mean time the grand Duke being returned to his palace could not rest there having observed in Bianca in spite of all her endeavours to hide it a great concern at his late discourse and impatient to give some satisfaction either to her or himself returned back and not finding her in her apartment softly descended the backstairs from the door of which he overheard every word that had passed and Pietro thus answering his wife in a great rage turned his back and went out of the  house Deaf to all her calls and despising all her care he left her overwhelmed with grief and tears in which she retired to her own apartment without knowing Francisco had been there he having taken care to mount the staircase first and get out of sight  Here she gave a loose to all her sorrows enumerating all her misfortunes and lamenting the hour that brought her to the light of this world where she was doom'd to find them and in a flood of tears gave vent to the passion that filled her breast Long would these reflections have employed her time and thoughts had not the grand Duke interrupted them who coming into the room and appearing ignorant of the matter asked the cause saying  To what are owing these tears and these complaints dearer than my soul tell me what misfortune has befallen you  Nothing sir said she occasions my concern but compassion for my husband who as you have commanded I have admonished but he seems so little to regard his safety that I fear some mischief will attend him  Is it nothing but that replied the grand Duke Oh let him follow his own inclination and at last he will find the consequence but why will you afflict and torment yourself for what you cannot prevent a torrent must have way or they that try to stop it may be drowned in it Buonaventuri is headstrong and void of understanding which will inevitably draw on his fate if he does not quickly change his manners  Yet after all this the desperate Pietro full of indignation and revenge meeting Ruberto Ricci next day at the column of the Santa Trinita where he was talking with two other gentlemen he clapt a pistol to his breast saying  I don't know what hinders me despicable infamous wretch that you are from shooting you this minute through the heart but stay and hear what I have to say to you for you shall not escape me I will go to your aunt as often as I please in defiance of you and if ever I know or but guess that you make the least murmur or complaint to the grand Duke you shall not live an hour after it  Ricci being unarmed and thus accosted remained immoveable as a statue till the other had done speaking and then without the least reply went with his companions immediately to the grand Duke who was at the Casino where he declared to him all that had passed just before at the Column to which the two gentlemen witnessing the grand Duke who remembered his threats to his wife no longer doubting of his unbounded brutality thought within himself that there was no more time to be lost in inflicting on Pietro the punishment he deserved and taking Ricci apart they talked together for some time in the garden where the grand Duke having given him what directions he thought proper sent him away and the next morning by times mounting on horseback rode to his villa of Pratolino where he stayed all that day and the next night The result of their conference was that Ricci should get together twelve  companions all men well armed strong and resolute some of whom had cutlasses of such a temper that with one stroke they were able to cut off the head of a bull for he knew that Buonaventuri was ever provided with pistols and other arms from head to foot in which equipage he constantly went in the night to Bongianna's house not returning home till very late so that in order to be sure of his prey he divided his company setting two or more in different places through which Pietro might pass and his page who personally knew him as centinel at the beautiful bridge of la Santa Trinita to give notice when he should be there for which Ruberto waited with great impatience after he had made this disposition of his forces  And now the unlucky lover having spent the night with his mistress rose before break of day and taking leave of her went slowly to his own house As he was walking over the bridge the page gave two whistles and then cry'd alo alo the accustomed noise of the Florentine ruffians in those days at this the fierce Pietro though unused to fear felt some presage of his approaching fate and taking in his left hand a pistol held it ready cocked and with his drawn sword in his right passed the bridge that led directly to the great gate of his palace but as his apartment was on the groundfloor the door to it lay on the other side of the house so that he was obliged after descending the bridge to turn down a little street on the left hand of which within a stone's throw was the entrance that he always kept the  key of Meeting in this narrow passage two armed men he did not immediately think they had any design on him but going a little farther he saw four more who stopt his way and these having joined the two first six others started out and encompassed him with Ricci in the midst crying out kill kill the infamous traitor Buonaventuri knowing his voice threw his cloak to the ground and firing his pistol hit one of them but whilst he was taking another out of his pocket they all fell on him at once yet by means of his armour he escaped for some time making a very brave defence and had already wounded two of them when the assailants renewing their attack by the advantage of their short arms and the closeness of the street struck him at every blow so that being driven to the wall he could do little damage with his sword but as Ricci got under it thinking to end him he exerted all his force for one blow and cut him quite thorough his iron headpiece to his skull at the sight of which a cousin of Ricci's with a back stroke wounded Pietro in the face and repeating it with a second split one side of his head so that his brains stuck to the wall Buonaventuri finding himself dying said oh no more for mercy since I am dead and dropt down after which they all fell on him stabbing him in every part which his armour did not cover and there left him with no less than five and thirty mortal wounds Ricci as fast as he could got to the palace of the princess Isabella where though his hurt was dangerous he was by the help of a good surgeon cured in a short time  Not far from the place where this bloody scene was acted stood an apothecary's shop the people of which having heard the clash of arms and noise of men with two of their boys as it drew near day went to see what was the matter and there found the unfortunate Pietro bathed in his blood upon the ground and by same faint short sighs could just perceive he was not quite dead upon which they run for a light and immediately conveyed him to the nearest church named St Jacopo which stands upon the river Arno  The sun was no sooner up than the death of Buonaventuri was spread about the whole city and coming to the ears of the poor deluded but still affectionate Bianca almost distracted her She with the utmost violence of passion was ready to destroy herself in order to follow him which perhaps in the first rage of sorrow she might have done notwithstanding the endeavours of all her friends and acquaintance who came to comfort her if the great Duke had not arrived at that juncture to restrain and pacify her which even he found difficulty in doing  The next night after this had happened as soon as it was quite dark two armed men masked got into Bongianna's house by the tiles and cutting her throat left her dead on the floor such was the miserable end of these thoughtless lovers and such the revenge taken by this lady's relations for the infamy she had brought upon them  The grand Duke that he might not seem to know of this execution put on all the appearance of anger and inquisition after the actors in it but  took care they never should be discovered so that by degrees the affair was dropt and Ricci unsuspected went about as before  Time which alleviates all affliction had now restored Bianca to herself whose charms and merits the Grand Duke grew every day more sensible of and reflecting that his love alone had obscured her virtues which in themselves were both great and many and that her birth though not royal was illustrious resolved to give the utmost proof of a sincere passion by sharing his power and title with her who had already all his heart and on the evening of the d of June publicly married her commanding the senate of forty eight to do her homage as grand Dutchess and the next day she went out as such with the German guard and a train of eight coaches To compleat her glory the senate of Venice when they heard she was become great Dutchess of Tuscany not only repealed their former acts against her but made a new one by which she was adopted daughter of that state which sent a solemn embassy with it to the grand Duke and a dowry suitable to the dignity they had given her  When the sudden marriage of Francisco was effected the cardinal Ferdinando his next brother resided at Rome where he received the news of it with the greatest indignation his haughty soul not enduring any alliance below that of a crowned head and he esteemed his blood so much disgraced by this marriage that he set a thousand machines at work to take away what he called the shame of his family by the death of Bianca whom he  oftentimes attempted to poison either by means of her servants or presents that he sent her His designs by one accident or other being discovered made her very cautious nor was he less suspicious of her fearing to meet the same fate he had designed to give so that a mutual hate reign'd in both though both disguised it out of regard to the grand Duke  It happened one time amongst others that the cardinal being at Florence and they all dining together the grand Dutchess had that morning taken a fancy to make a tart with her own hands which towards the latter end of the dinner was served up with other things of the same sort and when Ferdinando was desired to taste of it he put it off and began some gay discourse that he might not appear to have any thought about it At last the grand Duke after having asked his brother several times to taste what Bianca had made said since none else will begin I must and took a piece and eat it after which the grand Dutchess did the like and the conversation continued for some time with the same good humour when all of a sudden they both felt such violent and strong pains in their bowels that they were obliged to retire to their apartment and go to bed where they waited in vain for remedies and physicians the cardinal having given strict commands that none should come near them himself and his creatures keeping guard at the doors for that purpose whilst the poor unhappy princes expired in tortures on the th of October He buried them by each other with all due honours himself  renouncing the cardinal's hat was immediately acknowledged grand Duke of Tuscany through all which he caused a report to be spread that Bianca Capello intended to poison him which he pretended he discovered by means of a ring he always wore the stone in it being of a nature to change colour at the approach of poison and so he avoided tasting the tart which she seeing her husband do rather than outlive him or discover her treachery chose to eat the rest but however this story was strengthened by authority very few believed it for besides the improbability of her killing herself with that coolness when she might have found a hundred pretences to hinder Francisco from eating the tart without discovering herself and would no doubt if she had known it to be poisoned many circumstances concurred to make it plainly a contrivance of the cardinals who had bribed the servant that provided the materials for the tart to put poison amongst them But as Francisco dying without a son left Ferdinando his heir the nobles thought it wiser to receive with a good grace their living prince than hazard their safeties by a vain inquiry after the dead one tho' a man beloved and esteemed a fine gentleman and great governor all the arts and sciences being in perfection in his time as may be seen by their best poets and historians who all dedicated their works to him  THE HISTORY OF THE COUNT DE COMMINGE CONTINUED  AFTER suffering fifteen days the agonies of a most violent fever I began tho' by slow degrees to recover The first thing I did when I was able to attend to any thing was to seek for the letter I had received from Adelaida My mother who had taken it from me for fear it should increase my affliction was obliged to restore it to me After I had read it several times I put it into a little silk bag and placed it on my heart where I had always kept her picture and whensoever I was alone it was always my employment to gaze upon that lovely picture and read that letter  My mother who was of a soft and tender disposition shared my grief she likewise thought it best to yield to my first transports and leave it to time to finish my cure She permitted me to speak of Adelaida and sometimes was the first to mention her to me and perceiving that the only thing which gave me consolation was the thought of being loved by her she told me that it was she herself that had determined Adelaida to marry  I ask your pardon my dear son said she for the grief I have caused you I did not imagine you would have felt her loss so deeply I trembled for your health and even your life while you continued under that cruel confinement I knew your father's inflexible temper and was convinced he would never set you at liberty while there was a possibility of your marrying mademoiselle de Lussan I resolved to speak to that generous young lady I told her my fears for your health she partook in them she felt them perhaps with more force than I did From that moment I saw her use every endeavour to hasten her marriage for her father justly irritated at the proceedings of monsieur de Comminge had long pressed her to marry hitherto she had resisted his solicitations and even his commands I asked her which of those persons who addressed her she would chuse It matters not which replied she they are all equal to me since I cannot be his to whom I have given my heart Two days after I had this conservation with her I learned that the marquis de Benavides was preferred to all his rivals every one was surprised at her choice and I as much as any other Benavides has a disagreeable person his understanding is mean and his temper extremely bad this last circumstance made me tremble for poor Adelaida I was resolved to tell her my apprehensions I went for that purpose to the house of the countess de Garlande where we used to meet  I am prepared said she for misery but I must marry and since I know it is the only  means of procuring your son's liberty I reproach myself every moment that I delay this sacrifice yet this marriage which I consent to only for his sake will perhaps be the most cruel of his misfortunes I will at least convince him by my choice that his interest was the sole motive which engaged me to it Pity me dear Madam I deserve your pity and by my behaviour to Mons Benavides I will endeavour to render myself worthy of your esteem  My mother afterwards told me that Adelaida was made acquainted by my father himself with my having burnt the writings he publicly upbraided her with it on the day that he lost his process  She confessed to me added my mother that she was more affected with your extreme delicacy in concealing so generous an action than with the action itself  We passed the days in such conversations my melancholy was excessive yet tho' deprived of hope I found a kind of sweetness in the idea of my being still loved  After a stay of two months my mother received orders from my father to return to him He had expressed no concern for my illness and his cruel treatment of me had extinguished every sentiment of tenderness for him My mother pressed me to go with her but I intreated her to consent to my staying in the country she yielded to my reasons and left me I was now once more alone in the midst of my woods and found so much sweetness in solitude that I would then have abandoned every thing and taken up my habitation in some hermit's cell had I not been restrained by my tenderness  for my mother I often resolved to endeavour to see Adelaida but the fear of displeasing her stopt me At length after long irresolution I thought I might at least attempt to see Adelaida without being seen by her  Accordingly I resolved to send a person in whom I could confide to Bourdeaux to know where she was and for this purpose I fixed upon a man who had attended me from my infancy My mother during my illness had restored him to his place about me he had been with me at the baths he knew Adelaida and when I mentioned my design to him he informed me that he had friends in the house of Benavides After having given him his orders which I repeated a thousand times I caused him to set out from the castle When he arrived at Bourdeaux he was informed that Benavides had carried his lady a short time after his marriage to an estate which he had in Biscay Saint Laurent for that was my servant's name wrote to me to know what he was to do next I sent him orders to go immediately into Biscay My desire of seeing Adelaida was so much increased by the hope I had conceived that it was not possible for me to oppose it any longer  Saint Laurent returned at the expiration of six weeks which my anxiety and impatience had lengthened into so many ages He told me that after many fruitless attempts Benavides having occasion for an architect he had prevailed upon his friend to present him to him in that quality that having acquired some knowledge of the art from an uncle under whose care he had been brought  up he made no scruple to undertake the business Benavides employed him in  I believe said he that Madame de Benavides knew me for she blushed when she first saw me  He then told me that she lived the most retired and melancholy life imaginable that her husband hardly ever quitted her a moment and that it was said in the house he was excessively fond of her but that he gave her no other proof of it than by his extreme jealousy which he carried so far that even his brother had not the liberty of seeing her but when he was present I asked my servant some questions about that brother he told me that he was a very amiable young man and that the world spoke as much in his favour as they did to the disadvantage of Benavides and that he appeared to be greatly attached to his sisterinlaw  This discourse made no impression upon me at that time the unhappy situation of Madame de Benavides and the desire of seeing her employed my whole soul Saint Laurent assured me he had taken proper measures for introducing me into the house of Benavides  He has occasion for a painter said he to me to paint an apartment I promised to bring a good one and you must undertake this business  Nothing now remained but to regulate our departure I wrote to my mother and told her I was going to pass some time at the house of one of my friends This done I set out with Saint Laurent for Biscay during our journey I was continually asking him questions concerning Madame de Benavides I was desirous of knowing the slightest  particulars relating to her Saint Laurent was not able to satisfy my curiosity he had but few opportunities of seeing her she was shut up in her own apartment with no other company but a little dog of which she was extremely fond This article touched me particularly I had presented her with that dog and I flattered myself that she loved it for my sake These little things which escape one in good fortune affect one sensibly in misery the heart in the need it has of consolation fastens upon every thing which is likely to afford it  Saint Laurent often mentioned to me the great attachment of young Benavides to his sisterinlaw he added that he often opposed the furious sallies of his brother's temper and but for his good offices Adelaida would be still more miserable than she was He earnestly intreated me to be contented with the pleasure of seeing her and to make no attempt to speak to her  not because it would endanger your life added he that I know is too weak a motive to restrain you but because she will suffer by any imprudence you may be guilty of  The liberty of seeing Adelaida appeared to me so great a blessing that I was fully persuaded that alone would satisfy me and resolved within myself and promised Saint Laurent to behave with the utmost circumspection After a most tedious journey as my impatience made it seem we arrived at Biscay and was presented to Benavides who set me to work immediately  The supposed architect and I were lodged in the same apartment and to him was committed the  care of overseeing the workmen I had been several days at work before I saw madame de Benavides at length I perceived her one evening from a window in my own room going to walk in the garden She had only her little favourite dog with her her dress was negligent a kind of languishing melancholy appeared in her looks and motions and her fine eyes seemed to dwell on the objects around her without regarding them Oh heavens what sweetly painful emotions did my soul feel at the sight of her I continued leaning on the window the whole time she staid in the garden it was dark when she returned so that I could not distinguish her when she passed by my window but my heart knew it was her  I saw her a second time in the chapel of the castle I placed myself in such a manner that I could look at her the whole time without being observed She never once turned her eyes upon me I ought to have rejoiced at this circumstance since I well knew that if she discovered me she would be obliged to go out of the chapel yet I was afflicted at it and returned to my chamber in greater disquiet than when I left it I had not yet formed any design of making myself known to her but I was sensible that I should not be able to resist doing it if an opportunity offered  The sight of young Benavides gave me likewise some kind of uneasiness he often came to see me work and notwithstanding the seeming distance of our rank he behaved to me with an obliging familiarity which ought to have excited my esteem yet it had no effect on me His great merit and  the amiableness of his person which I could not but be sensible of withheld my gratitude I was afraid of a rival in him and a certain impassioned sadness that I perceived in him which was too like my own not to proceed from the same cause gave me a suspicion which he soon confirmed  After asking me one day several questions relating to my condition in life  You are in love said he to me sighing imperceptibly to himself the melancholy in which I perceive you continually plunged persuades me that your heart is not well tell me the truth can I do any thing for you The miserable in general have a claim to my compassion but there is one sort of grief which I pity more than any other  I believe I thanked Don Gabriel that was his name with a very ill grace for the kind offers he made to me however I could not help owning to him that I was in love but I told him that time only could produce any change in the state of my fortune  You are not absolutely unhappy replied he since you may hope for a change I know persons who are much more to be pitied than you  When I was alone I reflected upon the conversation that had passed betwen Don Gabriel and myself I concluded that he was in love and that his charming sisterinlaw was the object of his passion his whole behaviour which I examined with the utmost attention convinced me I was not mistaken I observed him always assiduous about Adelaida he gazed on her with eyes like mine yet I was not jealous my esteem for Adelaida  would not admit of such an injurious sentiment but I could not help fearing that the company of an agreeable man who was continually rendering her services that softened the horrors of her present situation would make her reflections on me be greatly to my disadvantage whose passion had been productive of nothing but misfortunes to her  I was full of these thoughts when one day I saw Adelaida enter the room where I was painting led by Don Gabriel  Why said she do you press me to come and look at the ornaments of this apartment you know I have no taste for these things  I hope madam said I looking earnestly upon her and bowing low that if you will deign to cast your eyes upon what is here you will find something not unworthy your attention  Adelaida struck with the sound of my voice turned instantly towards me I perceived she knew me for she blushed and bent her eyes on the ground and after pausing a moment she left the room without giving me a look saying that the smell of the paint was disagreeable to her  I remained behind terrified confused and overwhelmed with grief Adelaida had not deigned to give me a second look she would not even shew that she was enough interested in my disguise to express any signs of resentment at it What have I done said I I am indeed come hither contrary to her commands but if she still loves me she would pardon a fault that proceeded from the excess of my passion for her I now concluded that since Adelaida no longer loved me she must of necessity  have bestowed her heart upon another This idea filled me with a grief so new and violent that I thought I had never been truly miserable till then  Saint Laurent who came from time to time to see me entering the room that moment found me in an agitation that made him tremble  What ails you sir said he to me what has happened to you  I am undone replied I Adelaida no longer loves me she no longer loves me repeated I it is but too true alas I never had reason to complain of my fate till this cruel moment what torment would I now endure to purchase this blessing which I have lost this blessing which I preferred to all things and which in the midst of my greatest miseries filled my heart with so soft a joy  I continued a long time to exclaim in this manner while Saint Laurent in vain endeavoured to draw from me the cause of my grief At length I related to him what had happened  I see nothing in all this said he which ought to drive you to the despair I see you in Madam de Benavides is certainly offended at your rash attempt She was desirous of punishing you by appearing indifferent and perhaps she was apprehensive of betraying herself if she had looked upon you  No no interrupted I they who love have no such command over themselves in those first emotions the heart alone is listened to I must see her added I I must reproach her with her change Alas after giving herself to another  ought she to take away my life by so cruel an indifference why did she not leave me in my prison there I should have been happy had I been assured of her love  Saint Laurent fearing that any one should see me in the condition I was in obliged me to retire to the chamber where we both lay I past the whole night in tormenting myself my thoughts were at strife with each other in one moment I condemned my suspicions and the next relapsed into them again I thought it unjust to wish that Adelaida should preserve a tenderness which rendered her miserable In those moments I reproached myself for loving her less than my own satisfaction  Why should I wish to live said I to Saint Laurent if she loves another I will endeavour to speak to her only to bid her an eternal adieu she shall hear no reproaches from my mouth my grief which I cannot conceal from her shall speak for me  When this point was resolved upon it was agreed that I should leave Biscay as soon as I should have an interview with her we then began to consider upon the necessary means of procuring it Saint Laurent told me that we must seize the first opportunity that offered when Don Gabriel went to hunt as he often did and Benavides was employed in his domestic affairs for which he always set apart two mornings in the week He then made me promise that to avoid giving any suspicion I should go on with my painting as usual but that I should likewise declare that I was under a necessity of returning soon to my own country  Accordingly I resumed my former employment I had almost without perceiving it some hope that Adelaida would come again into that apartment every noise that I heard gave me an emotion I was scarce able to bear In this situation I remained several days and then losing all hope of seeing Adelaida in that manner I eagerly sought for some moment in which I might be so fortunate as to find her alone At length this moment came I was going as usual to my work when I saw Adelaida passing to her own apartment I knew that Don Gabriel went out early that morning to hunt and I had heard Benavides talking in a low hall of the castle to one of his farmers so that I was pretty certain of finding her alone  I entered her apartment with so much precipitation that Adelaida saw me not till I was very near her she would have retired to her closet as soon as she perceived me but I catched hold of her robe and prevented her  Do not fly from me madam said I to her suffer me this last time to enjoy the blessing of beholding you I shall never importune you more I am going far from you to die with grief for the miseries I have been the cause of to you and for the loss of your heart I wish Don Gabriel may be more fortunate than I have been  Adelaida whose surprise had hitherto prevented her from speaking interupted me at these words and giving me a look of mingled tenderness and anger  What said she dare you make me reproaches dare you suspect meyou  The tone with which she pronounced these last words  brought me instantly at her feet  No my dear Adelaida interupted I no I have no suspicion that is injurious to you pardon a few distracted words which my heart disavows  I pardon you all said she to me provided you depart immediately and never attempt to see me more Reflect that it is for your sake I am the most miserable creature in the world would you give me cause to reproach myself with being the most criminal  I will do every thing you command me replied I but only promise that you will not hate me  Although Adelaida had several times desired me to rise yet I still continued at her feet To those who truly love this attitude has a thousand secret charms I was still kneeling when Benavides suddenly opened the chamber door Transported with rage he flew towards his wife and drawing his sword "Thou shalt die perfidious woman" cried he and would have infallibly killed her had I not thrown myself between them and put by his sword with my own  Wretch cried Benavides you first shall feel my vengeance  and at the same time gave me a wound on my shoulder I did not love life well enough to be solicitous for the preservation of it but my hatred to Benavides would not suffer me to abandon it to his fury this cruel attempt upon the person of his wife deprived me almost of reason I threw myself upon him and plunging my sword in his body he fell at my feet without sense or motion The servants drawn by the cries of madame de Benavides entered the room that moment  and several of them throwing themselves upon me disarmed me while I made no effort to defend myself The sight of madame de Benavides bathed in tears and kneeling by her husband left me no sensibility of any thing but her grief I was dragged out of her chamber into another and the door fastened upon me  There it was that delivered up to my own reflections I saw the abyss into which I had plunged madame de Benavides the death of her husband killed before her eyes and killed by me could not fail of giving rise to suspicions against her How did I not reproach myself I had been the cause of her first misfortunes and I had now completed her ruin by my imprudence My imagination continually represented to me the dreadful condition in which I had left her I acknowledge that she had just reasons to hate me and I did not murmur at it The only consolation I had was in the hope that I was not known The idea of being taken for an assassin and a robber which on any other occasion would have made me tremble with horror now gave me joy Adelaida knew the innocence of my intentions and Adelaida was the whole world to me  Impatient to be interrogated that I might clear the honour of Adelaida I passed several hours in the most racking inquietude in the middle of the night my chamber door was opened and I saw Don Gabriel enter  To be continued  TREATISE ON THE EDUCATION of DAUGHTERS CONTINUED  CHAP IV Indirect Instructions and that Children ought not to be urged  I AM persuaded it would be right to make frequent use of such indirect instructions as are not so tiresome as lessons and remonstrances meerly to awaken their attention to those examples we would lay before them  One person may sometimes say to another in their hearing why did you act in that manner and the other may answer for such and such a reason for instance why did you acknowledge your fault because it would have been a greater to disavow it meanly by the help of a lie and nothing sounds handsomer than to say frankly I was in the wrong upon this let the first commend him for thus passing sentence upon himself but all this should be carried without affectation for children have more penetration than is generally thought and as sure as they discover any artifice in their governors  they fall off from that simplicity and reliance so natural to them  We have formerly remarked that the brain of infants is very hot and moist which therefore subjects them to be in continual motion This softness of the brain is the reason why the images of all sensible objects impress themselves thereon very easily and in very lively characters we should not let slip this opportune season but then be careful in our choice of the images to be engraved for in a receptacle so small and so precious none but very valuable things ought to be deposited nothing but what we may wish to remain there during life The first let of images engraven while the brain is so soft and entirely unoccupied are always the deepest as it dries they harden and become indelible hence it is that though grown old we remember the passages of our youth through a long space of time distinctly but those of our more advanced age in a much slighter manner because those traces were drawn in the brain already dried and marked with many other figures  Perhaps this kind of reasoning will with difficulty be admitted nevertheless it is certain every one talks in this way without perceiving it do we not say every day I have taken my biass I am too old to change I was brought up to this and besides is there not a particular pleasure in recalling the images of our youth the strongest inclinations are they not such as were taken at that age and does not all this prove that the first impressions and first habits are the most prevalent  Now though infancy is the fittest season for engraving images on the brain yet it must be confessed not to be the same with respect to reasoning that humidity which so easily admits impression being joined to a great degree of warmth is productive of an unsettledness that is an enemy to close application their brain is in the condition of a lighted taper exposed to the air its flame perpetually wavering a child asks a question and before you can answer his eyes are upon the wainscot counting all the figures painted there or all the pieces of glass that compose the windows To force him back to his first object is as it were to put him in confinement So then it behoves us with great care to temporise with the organs till they are grown firm answer his question directly and let him ask others as he likes entertain his curiosity only and furnish his memory with a stock of good materials The time will come when they will assemble of themselves and the brain having obtained a consistence the child will reason of course at which time when he happens not to reason justly confine yourself to setting him right and letting him see without emotion as he shall give you an opportunity what it is to draw a true consequence Suffer a child therefore to have his play and mingle instruction with it that wisdom may not shew herself to him but at intervals and ever with a smiling countenance take care I say of tiring him with indiscrete exactness  If a child once forms to himself a frightful and gloomy idea of virtue if selfwill and irregularity appear to his eyes in a pleasing shape all is lost  your endeavours are in vain therefore keep him ever from the flatteries of the narrowminded and the profligate We grow to love the manners and sentiments of the persons we love the pleasure found for the time in the company of immoral people draws us on by degrees to esteem those very qualities in them which are most to be abominated  In order to give children a liking to the welldisposed bring them to remark all that in them is both amiable and profitable their sincerity their modesty their disinterestedness fidelity and discretion but above every thing their piety which is the source of all Should it happen that any such have something about them disagreeable and disgusting you may say these defects take not their rise from Piety she eradicates or at least abates them  Though you should keep strict watch over yourself never to let him see in you ought but what is right yet expect not that your defects will escape him frequently he will perceive some of your minutest failings St Austin tells us that he in his infancy remarked the vanity of his masters in their respective professions The best step you can take and the most important is to be as well acquainted with your own defects as will the child and to get some sincere friends to advertise you of them Generally speaking those who have the government of children pardon nothing in them and every thing in themselves this excites in the young ones a spirit of criticism and illnature insomuch that when ever they can espie any fault in the governor  they are quite delighted what they want is a reason to hold him in contempt Avoid this inconvenience nor fear to speak of your visible defects nor of the errors that have escaped you in his presence as you find him capable of hearing reason say that you are desirous to set him an example of correcting his errors by correcting your own Thus will you draw from your imperfections themselves matter of instruction and edification for the child and give him courage to bear correction thus will you escape that contempt and disgust which your failings might give him for your person  At the same time it is necessary to take all methods to render the things you require of him agreeable suppose some particular one should be in its nature unpleasant assure him that his trouble will be followed with satisfaction explain the usefulness of what you would teach him shew him the relation it bears to the commerce of the world and the duties of his station without this study will appear an abstract barren and thorny piece of work to what purpose will they say to themselves is it to learn all these things which are never mentioned in conversation and have no relation to what one is obliged to do It is necessary therefore to give them the reason for teaching them it is we may say to put you in a capacity of doing well what one day will be your duty It is to form your judgment it is to use you to reason well upon the affairs of life One should always place in their view some truly useful and agreeable end that will keep up the spirit of application  but never pretend to force them to it by meer tyrannical authority  Never assume without extreme necessity an austere and imperious air such as makes children tremble It is for the most part affectation and pedantry in governesses for as to children they are generally but too meek and bashful it is the way to harden their hearts and to destroy that trust and reliance without which no fruit of education is to be expected Make yourself beloved by them that they may be free with you and not fear to let you see their faults to bring this about be indulgent to those of them who act without disguise seem neither astonished nor provoked at their bad inclinations on the contrary bear with their weaknesses sometimes this inconvenience will arise that they will be under less restraint of fear yet upon the whole a reliance and a sincerity kept up will be more serviceable to them than your exertion of rigorous authority Authority will at all times take place when respect and persuasion fail we should ever begin with an open behaviour easy and familiar without meanness this affords an opportunity of seeing their real tempers and of knowing them thoroughly In short though you should reduce them by dint of authority to the observation of all your rules the whole would be but a scene of stiff formalities perhaps of hypocrisy you would give them a disgust to that good which it ought to be your sole aim to make them love  If the wise son of Sirach continually recommends it to parents ever to keep the rod lifted up over their children if he hath said Play with thy child  and he will bring thee to heaviness  Fcclesiasticus Chap xxx ver  it is not that he means to blame a gentle and patient education he only condemns those weak and inconsiderate parents who flatter the passions of their children and aim at nothing but to please themselves with them during their infancy to such a degree as to indulge them in all kinds of excesses  The conclusion from this is that parents ought always to keep authority in reserve for correction for there are dispositions which must be subdued by fear but once again it is not to be made use of but when we have nothing else left  A child who hitherto acts merely by his imagination and confounds in his head those things that present themselves to him in combination hates study and virtue whenever he is prepossessed with an aversion to the person that talks to him of them  Observe here the source of that gloomy and frightful idea of piety which he retains all his life it is often the only part that stays with him of an education of severity  Frequently it will behove us to tolerate things that require to be corrected and to watch for the moment in which the spirit of the child shall be disposed to profit by correction Never reprehend him in his first emotion nor in your own if you do it during your own he will perceive you to be actuated by your mood and overhastiness not by reason or friendship to him you will lose your authority without resource In case you reprove him in his first emotion consider he has not his spirit enough at liberty to acknowledge his fault to overcome  his passion to perceive the importance of your reproof This is to expose the child to a losing of the respect which he owes you let him always see you master of yourself and this your patience will best show him Watch day after day if need be for the favourable moments to introduce reproof Tell him not of his faults without adding the method of surmounting them something that may hearten him to endeavour it for we must beware of the chagrin and despondency which mere dry correction brings on  If one finds the child somewhat reasonable I believe it right to engage him insensibly to desire to be told of his mistakes and by this means he will hear them without being afflicted but even then let him hear but one at a time It ought to be considered that children have weak heads and by reason of their age are sensible of pleasure alone whereas there is oft times expected of them an exactness and seriousness of which the very people that require it are not themselves capable nay their very temper receives a dangerous tincture of uneasiness and melancholy from being continually talked to of words and things they understand not no liberty no diversion but always a lesson silence a prescribed posture rebukes threats The ancients understood this matter much better among the Hebrews Egyptians and Greeks the principal sciences the maxims of virtue and politeness of manners were introduced by the delightfulness of verse and music people that have not read can hardly believe this so wide is it from our customs nevertheless whoever is the least acquainted with  history can have no doubt of its having been the common practice for several ages  In this our age let us accede so far as to unite the agreeable with the useful as much as lies in our power  Now though with regard to numbers of children whose tempers are difficult to be wrought upon we cannot hope not to be obliged to make use of fear yet we should first have tried with patience every other remedy  We ought to make them apprehend distinctly the sum of what we require of them the very point which would please us for liveliness of disposition and their reliance on us ought to be kept up otherwise their spirit will be dulled and their courage abated the bold will be provoked the gentle made stupid Fear is like those forcible remedies made use of in violent illnesses they purge but they alter the temperament and wear the organs and thus amind acted upon by fear is constantly rendered weaker  To be continued  THE LADY'S MUSEUM  The TRIFLER NUMBER VIII  MADAM  _IF the title of a literary performance contributes much to excite the curiosity of the public I can well suppose that the Trifler is eagerly perused by all the bright eyes of the kingdom for surely a greater consonancy between the title of this essay and the present complection of females cannot well be imaginedFor to what end or use do the multiplied branches of female education serve but to trifle gracefully and agreeably This is the true  sçavoir vivre  so happily and universally taught by those valuable people the French governesses all over this great metropolis for surely no other  persons can pretend with equal justice to give people of fashion that charming air and those enchanting manners which alone can make them look like themselves Did our young gentlemen enjoy the benefit of instruction equally salubrious I should hope that in a little time they might learn to trifle away their courage and honesty almost as happily as the French themselves seem to have done  Nor let it derogate in the least from the present approved system of things that in the fervid pursuit of higher attainments the ladies may very possibly less attend to duty character reputation than some Cynical persons have been willing to approve of Surely such mean insinuations could only be suggested by those whose exploded nonsense has totally disqualified them for the society of the triflersAnd really was the accusation well founded I don't see what blame could justly lie upon us who have never been taught to set the least value on moral obligations  In how much more pleasing a light have we been instructed to consider the scope and design of our being We have at length happily resolved it into one general principle that of being  delightfully idle  In order to support the consistency of our character give me leave to descend to a few particulars If a lady spends her whole life in fretful dissipation is it not plain that she considers her time for the use of which some have fancied themselves accountable as a meer trifle  If another considers cards as the true consolation of life and consequently makes them the sole business of it supposing even that she is unsuccessful no matter by what compensations she ballances her accounts her losses  in any way  can only be considered as meer trifles  If a third by the kind assistance of foreign tuition has been happily extricated from the restraints of modesty delicacy virtue and religion these omissions ought surely to be considered as so many negative advantages and their value placed to our account For it is well known that those exploded qualities which are now not worth a dispute were only held in great reverence in remarkably  simple times  However we are happily accomplished out of all those simplicities and have substituted in their room such opinions as have raised us above all vulgar fears and prejudicesHence it is that we have left the sense and love of religion to be embraced only by those who are no longer loved by any body Let such as want the solid supports of fashion luxury gallantry and fifty et cetera's take refuge in such aerial meditations for our part we shall take care to enjoy the substance and leave to those disappointed wretches the shadow  As to the churches I can't say what sort of people attend them as neither I or any of my acquaintance ever go there but in the way of curiosity and pleasure we sometimes visit the methodist conventicles and there thro' the whole auditory there obtains so visible a distraction that we have always considered those deluded people  as much more the objects of compassion than contempt  I have often thought it extremely well judged in the government to tolerate such places for they must considerably lessen the number of madhouses With such invariable constancy do we persevere in our opinions that our whole life may be considered as one uniform trifle and unless we should be encumbered by a few brats can it be said of any of us when we quit the scene that we have left any monuments of our existence  A tender regard for the honor laws and religion of one's country are considerations which only can affect narrow souls but thanks to the dear foreigners who direct our education we have been taught to consider things in a more elevated sense and to respect the interest of our very national enemies at least as much as our own and universally to prefer those people to our own natives  There is one discovery in particular that does infinite honour to our society and which for the credit of the sisterhood I must beg leave a little to enlarge uponI mean our discovery of the true sources of pleasure and happiness These objects were heretofore supposed to be best attained by  following nature  and to be inseparably connected with reason and duty Pleasure truly so called had formerly been considered as a very  natural thing  and some unintelligible stuff named virtue as the only safe road to happinessBut we have undeceived the world in these particulars and have taught them to look for their happiness  where none but ourselves ever dreamed it could be found  In short we have fixed its basis in the extinction of all reasonable ideas and to enjoy life the more perfectly have fairly consented to lose sight of all the ends of living This grand principle pervades the whole sphere of our activity and our conduct affords the most ample attestation of our opinionsLet others if they please look up to causes and consider consequences it is sufficient for us that we appear of consequence in the eyes of the world  Nor are we in the least disconcerted by the invidious remarks of those who would insinuate that we are not quite so happy as we would seem to be and that notwithstanding our continual efforts to appear highly pleased there is still a dismal vacuity in our minds  However that may be there is at least an equal vacuity in those understandings who have made that remark not to know that we live only for appearances and that to be or to seem only are pretty much the same thing with the whole race of triflers  Nay to a still higher heroism have we carried our ideas on this subject that with a magnanimity peculiar to ourselves we have exchanged realities for appearances and have lost all pleasure  merely for pleasure's sake  Let others ridiculously estimate their happiness by their own consciousness while we wisely measure ours by the opinions of other people which must always be in our favour so long as  to appear we strive  The most contented things alive  I can't conclude this letter without lamenting the great detriment our society have suffered by the conduct of Miranda This lady you know is the sworn enemy of all triflers and the business of her whole life has been to discredit our opinions Perverse creature not to have yielded to the conviction which  numbers fashion  and  raillery  scarcely ever fail to impress  Her obstinacy is the more to be lamented as from an  unusual  concurrence of circumstances her influence happens to be very extensive Happy for us there are few Miranda's for if we may judge from this one half a dozen such would be sufficient to destroy the credit of our society Never was there so ungrateful a creature would you believe it though nature has been extremely kind to her in the distribution of personal charms she never was so much as suspected to be sensible of the obligation It is very plain that this must be the case for had she been duly thankful for nature's liberality she would like the rest of us have solely relied upon it and never so far affronted her beauty as to endeavour to please by any other merit whatsoever  We have great reason to wish that nature in this instance had spared her bounty for her charms always create an attention which she never fails to improve to our prejudice However there is one consolation left as Miranda is yet single and the men almost all of our party who knows but the race may become extinct  This lady I am told among other singularities pretends to have opinions of her own and that  she makes reason and not ridicule the criterion by which she examines their truth Some of her notions are so extraordinary as to deserve being related She thinks that moral virtue on its true basis religion is the only sure and permanent object of esteem and that whatever purifies the heart does likewise embellish the manners and even raises the genius She cannot comprehend why a rational creature should be ashamed of its reason or blush to acknowledge a pleasure in cultivating it  She is of opinion that a woman of sense is a character not inferior to a woman of fashion and with an extravagant ambition has united both in her own person I have here only given you a small specimen of her notions which are such you see as leave us slender hopes of reclaiming her  Indeed were her opinions simply proposed to the understanding  or to the desires  which judge much better they are so repugnant to the present modes both of thinking and acting that they must be inevitably rejected as our custom is without any examination at all But things will appear very different seen through different mediums There are certain women who carry in their own persons a demonstration of their opinions Of that number is Miranda who besides has got such a way of  colouring  things and of recommending her notions by manners the most insinuating and a behaviour so sweetly feminine that I really begin to fear her impressions must be irresistible You know my dear every body is not fortified as we are and the girl has so imposing a way she certainly will continue to do much mischief Let us  not however be intimidated by so dangerous an enemy but unite more vigorously in our common defence The annals of all ages are in our favour for at what place or period could nature and reason prevail over folly and vanity  I shall further observe for our encouragement that the world never fails to applaud the time and pains which are devoted to the service of the triflers Upon this consideration I hope you will excuse the trouble occasioned by this long letter from your  Affectionate Sister and Servant ANOETA  THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED  WHEN Mr Herbert returned from his walk and met the curate and his little family at supper Sophia who heedfully observed him saw an alteration in his countenance which realized all her melancholy apprehensions and convinced her that some new misfortune awaited her his eyes which studiously avoided her's expressed nothing but grief and confusion but he retired so early to his chamber that Sophia finding there was no hopes of his explaining himself that night passed it in an anxiety of mind which suffered her not to taste the least repose Early in the morning he knocked at her door and desired her to join him in the garden she was already drest and instantly complied  As soon as she came up to him he took her hand and pressed it affectionately but spoke not a word  Sophia who feared as much as she wished to know what had happened had not power to ask for an explanation so they both continued silent for some minutes  At length Mr Herbert told her he was going to London Sophia in a faultering accent asked  him what had happened to occasion this sudden resolution  Alas my dear child said the good old man in great emotion I am ashamed and grieved to tell you that Sir Charles has I fear deceived me  Although Sophia had reason to expect some sad reverse of fortune and had endeavoured to prepare herself for it yet this fatal confirmation of her fears shocked her so much that Mr Herbert who saw a deathlike paleness overspread her face and felt her hand cold and trembling fearing she would faint made haste to lead her to a little bench of turf which was near them  Sophia recovering saw so much concern in his looks that struggling to repress her own anguish she endeavoured to comfort him and smiling through the tears that filled her charming eyes  Let not this instance of my weakness alarm you sir said she and doubt not but with the assistance of heaven I shall bear this strange insult with proper fortitude  How worthy are you my good child of better fortune  said Mr Herbert then taking a letter out of his pocket  My first design pursued he was to seek some explanation of this mysterious letter before I made you acquainted with it but I perceived that my too apparent uneasiness had alarmed you and I thought it would be less cruel to inform you of the whole matter than to leave you in doubt and uncertainty this letter was delivered to me yesterday in the evening by one of Sir Charles's servants just as was  walking out towards the road in hopes of meeting his master My surprise at receiving a letter when I expected to see himself made me open it instantly without asking the servant any questions and while I was reading it he went away doubtless being directed to do so  Mr Herbert then gave the letter to Sophia who unfolding it with trembling emotion found it was as follows  SIR  Since it is impossible my marriage with Miss Sophia can ever take place I wish you would look upon all that passed between us upon that subject as a dream I dreamt indeed when I imagined there was a woman in the world capable of a sincere attachment and I ought to be ashamed to own that upon so delusive a hope I was ready to act in opposition to the general maxims of the world and be pointed at as a silly romantic fellow However I beg you will assure the lady that as I have no right to blame her conduct so I have not the least resentment for it and am so perfectly at ease on this occasion that I can with great sincerity congratulate her on her approaching happiness I am Sir  Your humble Servant CHARLES STANLEY  Although this letter gave Sophia a sad certainty of her misfortune yet it relieved her from those worst pangs which a heart in love can feel the belief of being abandoned through indifference or inconstancy unperceived by ourselves pride mixes  with our most tender affections and either aggravates or lessens the sense of every disappointment in proportion as we feel ourselves humbled by the circumstances that attend it  This illdisguised jealousy the personated calmness the struggling resentment that appeared in this letter convinced Sophia that Sir Charles was far from being at ease and that to whatever cause his present unaccountable behaviour was owing yet she was sure at least of not being indifferent to him  It was not difficult to perceive that he had been deceived by some malicious reports and her suspicions fell immediately upon Harriot but rejecting this thought as too injurious to her sister she returned the letter to Mr Herbert without speaking a word but with a look much more serene and composed than before  Mr Herbert who saw nothing in this letter like what her penetration had discovered and who conceived it to be only a poor artifice to disengage himself from promises which he now repented of was surprised to find her so much less affected with it than he expected and asked her what she thought of it  Sophia told him that she was fully persuaded Sir Charles had been prejudiced against her  Do you think so my dear said he after a little pause then it is your sister to whom you are obliged for this kind office  I hope not sir replied Sophia sighing that circumstance would aggravate my concernindeed  I think it would be a crime in me to suspect her of being capable of such unkindness  Well resumed Mr Herbert I will if possible discover this mystery before night you shall hear from me tomorrow in the mean time calm your mind and resign yourself entirely to that providence which while you continue thus good and virtuous will never forsake you  Mr Herbert now left her to go and take leave of the curate and his family and Sophia whose fortune had undergone so many revolutions in so short a time retired to her chamber where she passed great part of the day alone at once to indulge her melancholy and to conceal it from observation  In the afternoon Dolly came up in a great hurry of spirits to acquaint her that Mrs Gibbons was come to wait upon her that she had been met at the door by her mother and that several courtesies had passed between them  The poor girl though transported with joy at this favourable beginning no sooner perceived by the pensive air in Sophia's countenance and the sighs that escaped her that her suspicions of some new disappointment having happened to her were true than instantly forgetting the prosperous situation of her own affairs her sweet face was overspread with tender grief and a tear stole from her eyes but Sophia whom nothing could have awakened from that stupifying sorrow in which any great and sudden misfortune plunges the mind but the desire of being useful to her friends soon assumed a more chearful look and hastened to receive her visitor  Mrs Gibbons was in full dress and had omitted no superfluous ornament that could serve to shew Sophia how well she understood every sort of punctilio As soon as the first compliments were over  You see madam said she what  affluence  your commands have over me I once little thought that I should ever have entered this impolished house again my nephew attended me to the door but I would not suffer him to come in because I am not sure that you are willing to let these people know the honour you do him by receiving his adorations  Sophia though a little startled at these words yet supposed she had no particular meaning in them and ascribed all to her fantastick manner of expressing herself but Mrs Gibbons being resolved to hasten the conclusion of an affair which she had very much at heart spoke so intelligibly at last that Sophia could no longer be ignorant of her design all the ill consequences of which suddenly striking her imagination she exclaimed in a tone of surprise and terror  Sure I am the most unfortunate creature in the world is it possible Mrs Gibbons that you can be serious have you really given any cause for a report that I receive your nephew's addresses if you have you have done me an irreparable injury  Sophia's spirits were so greatly agitated that she did not perceive how much of her situation these words discovered so that Mrs Gibbons who saw the tears flow fast from her eyes immediately comprehended the whole truth  I see plainly said she in great concern that I have been deceived and others perhaps have been so too I shall never  disculpate  myself for being the cause of any misfortune to you some more advantageous  treatise  has been on the  tapestry  and this unlucky affair has done mischief  Give me leave to ask you madam interupted Sophia with some peevishness what foundation you had for believing that I considered your nephew as my lover you know his heart has been long since engaged  I acknowledge I have been to blame my dear miss resumed Mrs Gibbons I was too  sanguinary  in my hopes but I beg you will  disclaim  no more this will do no good only tell me if it is possible to repair the harm I have done by my foolish schemes  To this Sophia made no answer but Mrs Gibbons who wanted neither tenderness nor candor and who was greatly concerned at the uneasiness she saw her under urged her so frequently and with so much earnestness to tell her if she could be of any use in clearing up a mistake that had possibly been disadvantageous to her that Sophia still attentive amidst all her own distresses to the interest of her friend thought this a favourable opportunity to serve her and therefore told Mrs Gibbons that if she was really sincere in her offers there was one way  I understand you madam interrupted Mrs Gibbons and I believe I may venture to say that I thought of this  expedition  before you did I  cannot indeed Miss Darnley I cannot consent to my nephew's marriage with the young woman here you know I have been affronted  Sophia now urged some arguments in favour of Mrs Lawson but chiefly rested her defence upon her ignorance of those form's of politeness and good breeding which Mrs Gibbons was so perfectly mistress of  This compliment put the old lady into so good a humour that she cried out  Well my dear Miss Darnley in regard to you I will take off the  probition  I laid on my nephew to visit here no more and this I hope added she smiling will set matters right in another place as for the rest I shall take no resolution till I see how they behave  Sophia in her transport at having succeeded so well with the old lady felt all her own griefs suspended and indeed when she reflected upon what had happened with regard to herself she found she had less cause for reflection than Mr Herbert or her own fears had suggested  Mrs Gibbons acknowledged that she had flattered herself with the hope of her nephew's being well received by her and that in consequence of it she had talked of their marriage as an event which was very likely to happen and which would give her great joy Sophia being fully persuaded that these reports had reached Sir Charles though by what means she was not so well able to determine easily accounted for that jealousy and resentment which had produced so strange an inconsistency in his behaviour and which Mr Herbert considered as a piece of artifice to palliate his lightness and inconstancy  The good old man animated by his affection for the poor afflicted Sophia rode with the utmost speed to town and alighted at the house of the young baronet The servants informed him that their master was in the country which was all the intelligence they could give him for they neither knew where he was nor when he would return Mr Herbert perplexed and concerned at this new disappointment repaired immediately to Mrs Darnley's hoping to hear some news of him there  Harriot in answer to his enquiries told him with an air of triumph that the same day they returned from visiting Sophia Sir Charles had waited on her mamma and her and had as usual past great part of the afternoon with them  Mr Herbert who was struck with this incident endeavoured to make some discoveries concerning their conversation and Harriot's malice made this no difficult matter for she could not forbear throwing out some sarcasms against her sister whose extreme sensibility she insinuated had already found out a new object  Mr Herbert by his artful questions drew her into a confession of all that had passed between her and the baronet upon this subject and was convinced that her malignant hints had poisoned his mind with suspicions unfavourable to Sophia  He went away full of indignation at her treachery and still doubtful of Sir Charles's sincerity who he could not suppose would have been so easily influenced by Harriot's suggestions whose envious disposition he well knew if his intentions had been absolutely right  The next morning he received a letter from Sophia in which she acquainted him with the discoveries she had made and modestly hinted her belief that Sir Charles had been imposed upon by this report of her intended marriage which she found was spread through the village and which as it was very probable he had intelligence from thence had confirmed any idle raillery to that purpose which her sister might have indulged herself in  Mr Herbert reflecting upon all these unlucky circumstances began to suppose it possible that Sir Charles had been really deceived He went again to his house but had the mortification to hear from a servant whom he had not seen the day before that the baronet was at his seat in  Thither the good old man resolved to go the inconveniencies and expence of such a journey which in his years and narrow circumstances were not inconsiderable had not weight enough with him to make him balance a moment whether he should transact this affair by letter or in person The happiness of his dear and amiable charge depended upon his success he therefore delayed no longer than to make the necessary preparations for his journey and after writing to Sophia to acquaint her with his design he set out for Sir Charles's seat where he met with a new and more severe disappointment The first news he heard was that the baronet was not in that part of the country and upon a fuller enquiry of his servants he was informed that their master had the morning before set out for Dover with an intention to go to Paris  Mr Herbert dispirited with this news and fatigued with his fruitless journey retired to his inn where he passed the lonely hours in melancholy reflections upon the capricious behaviour of Sir Charles and the undeserved distresses of the innocent Sophia  Sir Charles however notwithstanding appearances was at present more unhappy than guilty His resolution to marry Sophia though suddenly formed was not the less sincere he had always loved her with the most ardent passion and had not the light character of her mother and sister concurred with those prejudices which his youth his fortune and his converse with the gay world led him into his heart which never ceased to do homage to her virtue would have sooner suggested to him the only means of being truly happy  An overstrained delicacy likewise proved another source of disquietude to him The inequality of their circumstances gave rise to a thousand tormenting doubts he was afraid that dazzled with the splendor of his fortune she would sacrifice her inclinations to her interest and give him her hand without her heart and when doing justice to the greatness of her mind and the real delicacy of her sentiments he rejected this supposition as too injurious to her his busy imagination conjured up new forms of distrust he trembled left mistaking gratitude for love she should be deceived by her own generosity and nice sense of obligation and imagine it was the lover she prefered when the benefactor only touched her heart  Such was the perplexed state of his mind when Mrs Darnley and Harriot proposed making her a visit With some difficulty he conquered his desire of accompanying them but his impatience to hear of her carried him again to Mrs Darnley's much earlier in the evening than it was likely they would return presuming on his intimacy in the family he scrupled not to go up stairs telling the servant he would wait till the ladies came home  He sat down in the dining room where he gazed on Sophia's picture a long time At last a sudden fancy seized him to visit her apartment which he knew was on the second floor he ascended the stairs without being perceived and with a tender emotion entered the room where his beloved Sophia used to pass so many of her retired hours  It was still elegantly neat as when its lovely inmate was there for Harriot who hated this room because it contained so many monuments of her sister's taste and industry never went into it and it remained in the same order that she had left it  The first thing that drew the young baronet's attention was a fire screen of excellent workmanship it was a flowerpiece and executed with peculiar taste and propriety the wainscot was adorned with several drawings neatly framed and glassed In this art Sophia took great delight having while her father lived appropriated all her pocketmoney to the payment of a master to instruct her in it Sir Charles considered the subjects of these drawings with peculiar pleasure The delicate pencil of Sophia had here represented the  virtues and the graces from those lively ideas which existed in her own charming mind  Her little library next engaged his notice many of the books that composed it he had presented her but he was curious to see those which her own choice had directed her to and in this examination he met with many proofs of her piety as well as of the excellence of her taste  Several compositions of her own now fell into his hands he read them with eagerness and charmed with this discovery of those treasures of wit which she with modest diffidence so carefully concealed he felt his admiration and tenderness for her encrease every moment  While he was anxiously searching for more of her papers a little shagreen case fell from one of the shelves upon the ground He took it up and as every thing that belonged to her excited his curiosity he opened it immediately and with equal surprise and pleasure saw his own miniature in water colours which was evidently the performance of Sophia herself  Had it been possible for her to imagine the sudden and powerful effect the sight of this picture would have upon the heart of Sir Charles she would not have suffered so much uneasiness for the loss of it as she really had for forgetting where she had laid it she supposed it had dropt out of her pocket and was apprehensive of its having fallen into her sister's hands who she knew would not fail to turn this incident to her disadvantage  While Sir Charles gazed upon this artless testimony of Sophia's affection for him the softest gratitude  the tenderest compassion filled his soul  Oh my Sophia said he do you then truly love me and have I cruelly trifled with your tenderness  This thought melted him even to tears he felt in himself a detestation of those depraved principles which had suggested to him a design of debasing such purity he wondered at the hardness of his own heart that could so long resist the influence of her gentle virtues and suffer such sweet sensibility to waste itself in anxious doubts and disappointed hope  Being now determined to do justice to her merit and make himself happy his first design was to go immediately to Mr Lawson's but reflecting that Sophia had great reason to be dissatisfied with his conduct and that to remove her prejudices the utmost caution and delicacy was to be observed he conceived it would be more proper to make a direct application to Mr Herbert whom she loved and reverenced as a father than to present himself before her while her mind yet laboured with those unfavourable suspicions for which he had given but too much cause and hence new fears and doubts arose to torment him He dreaded left her just resentment for his injurious designs should have weakened those tender impressions she had once received and that in the pride of offended virtue every softer sentiment would be lost  Impatient of this cruel state of suspense and inquietude he left Sophia's apartment and repairing to the diningroom rang the bell for the servant of whom he enquired where Mr Herbert lodged  Having obtained a direction he went immediately to the house Mr Herbert was not at home and Sir Charles grieved at this disappointment and at Mrs Darnley's not returning that night from whom he hoped to have heard some news of Sophia the agitation of his mind made him think it an age till the next day in which he determined to put an end to all his perplexities and to fix his fate  After his interview with Mr Herbert and the good old man's departure to prepare Sophia for his intended visit the young baronet resigned his whole soul to tenderness and joy His impatience to see Sophia encreased with his hope of finding her sentiments for him unchanged and he regretted a thousand times his having suffered Mr Herbert to go away without him  Mean time a card came from Mrs Darnley and Harriot acquainting him that they were returned and thanking him for the use of his servants and chariot Sir Charles eager to hear news of his Sophia went immediately to wait on them and scarce were the first compliments over when he enquired for her with such apparent emotion that Harriot mortified to the last degree resolved to be even with him and said every thing that she thought would torment him and prejudice her sister  She told him that Sophia was the most contented creature in the world and that she was so charmed with her present way of life and her new companions that she seemed to have forgot all her old friends and even her relations  She is grown a meer country girl said she is always wandering about in the fields and meadows followed by a  young rustic who has fallen in love with her I rallied her a little upon her taste but I found she could not bear it and indeed he is extremely handsome and she says has had a genteel education  Harriot was at once pleased and grieved at observing the effect these insinuations had on Sir Charles his colour changed he trembled and fixing his eyes on the ground he remained pensive and silent while Harriot notwithstanding her mother's significant frowns proceeded in a malicious detail of little circumstances partly invented and partly mistaken which fixed the sharpest stings of jealousy in his heart  If in dealing with cunning persons we were always to consider their ends in order to interpret their speeches much of their artifice would lose its effect but Sir Charles had so contemptible an opinion of Harriot's understanding that although he knew she was malicious he never suspected her of being capable of laying schemes to gratify her malice and did not suppose she was mistress of invention enough to form so plausible a tale as that she had told  Impatient under those cruel doubts which now possessed him he resolved to go late as it was in the evening to Mr Lawson's house and taking an abrupt leave of Mrs Darnley and her daughter he went home and ordered his horses to be got ready He scarce knew his own design by taking this journey at so improper a time but in the extreme agitation of his mind the first idea of relief that naturally presented itself was to see Sophia  who alone could destroy or confirm his fears and this he eagerly pursued without any farther reflection  The servant to whom he had sent his orders made no haste to execute them as conceiving it to be a most extravagant whim in his master to set out upon a journey so late and in that manner While he with studied delays protracted the time hoping for some change in his resolutions Sir Charles racked with impatience counted moments for hours message after message was dispatched to the groom The horses at length were brought and Sir Charles with only one servant gallop'd away never stopping till he came to the place where Sophia resided  It was now night and the indecorum of making a visit at such a time in a family where he was a stranger first striking his thoughts he resolved to alight at an inn which he saw at a small distance and there consider what it was best for him to do  A guest of his appearance soon engaged the attention of the host and his wife They quitted two men with whom they had then been talking and with a great deal of officious civility attended upon Sir Charles who desired to be shewn into a room As he was following the good woman who declared he should have the best in her house the two men with whom she had been talking bowed to him when he passed by them the salute of the younger having a certain grace in it that drew his attention he looked back on him and at the sight of a very handsome face and a person uncommonly  genteel his heart by its throbbing emotion immediately suggested to him that this beautiful youth was the lover of his Sophia  The jealousy which Harriot's insinuations had kindled in his heart now raged with redoubled force this rival whom she had called a rustic and whom he fondly hoped to find such possessed the most attractive graces of form and probably wanted neither wit nor politeness Sophia's youth her tenderness her sensibility wounded by his dissembled indifference and the cruel capriciousness of his conduct all disposed her to receive a new impression and who so proper to touch her heart as this lovely youth whose passion as innocent as it was ardent and sincere banished all doubt and suspicion and left her whole soul open to the soft pleadings of gratitude and love  While he was wholly absorb'd in these tormenting reflections and incapable of taking any resolution the officious landlady entered his chamber to take his orders for supper  Sir Charles surprised to find it was so late resolved to stay there all night and after giving the good woman some directions his restless curiosity impelled him to ask her several questions concerning the old man and the youth whom he had seen talking to her  The hostess who was as communicative as he could desire told him that the old man was one farmer Gibbons of whom she had been buying a load of hay that the young one was his son and a great scholard  His aunt pursued she breeds  him up to be a gentleman and she has a power of money and designs to leave it all to him much good may it do him for he is as handsome a young man as one would desire to see Some time ago it was all over our town that he was going to be married to the parson's youngest daughter and she is a pretty creature and  disarves  him if he was more richer and handsomer than he is but whatever is the matter the old folks have changed their mind and his aunt they say wants to make up a match between him and a fine London lady that boards at the parson's but I'll never believe it till I see it for she and the parson's daughter are great friends they say and it would not be a friendly part to rob the poor girl of her sweetheart To say the truth I believe there is some juggling among them but this I keep to myself for I would not make mischief therefore I never tell my thoughts to any body but I wish the young folks well  Sir Charles who had listened to her with great emotion dismissed her now that he might be at liberty to reflect on what he had heard which although it did not lead him to a full discovery of the truth yet it suggested thoughts which relieved him in some degree from those dreadful pangs of jealousy with which he had hitherto been tortured and balanced at least his fears and his hopes  His impatience to free himself from this state of perplexity and suspence allowed him but little repose that night he rose as soon as the day appeared and it was with some difficulty that he prevailed  upon himself to defer his visit till a seasonable hour and then being informed that Mr Lawson's house was scarce a mile distant he left his servant and horses at the inn and walked thither amidst a thousand anxious thoughts which made him dread as much as he wished for an interview which was to decide his fate  As he drew near the house he perceived a young man sauntering about in an adjacent field whose air and mien had a great resemblance of the youth whom he had seen in the inn Sir Charles eager to satisfy his doubts followed him at a distance and the youth turning again his wishing eyes towards the house the baronet had a full view of his face  At the sight of his young rival his heart throbbed as if it would leave his breast he hastily retreated behind the hedge determined to watch his motions for he imagined and with reason that he came there to meet his mistress and who that mistress was whether Sophia or the curate's daugher was the distracting doubt which he now expected to have satisfied  He walked along by the side of the hedge still keeping William in sight who suddenly turning back rather flew than ran to meet a woman who beckoned to him Sir Charles saw at once his Sophia and the fatal sign which planted a thousand daggers in his heart Trembling and pale he leaned against a tree which concealed him from view and saw her advance towards his rival saw her in earnest discourse with him and to compleat his distraction and despair saw the happy youth throw himself at  her feet doubtless to thank her for the sacrifice she made to him of a richer lover  Such was the inference he drew from this action and now rage and indignation succeeding to grief in these first transports he was upon the point of discovering himself and sacrificing the hated youth to his vengeance but a moment's reflection shewed him the dishonour of a contest with so despicable a rival and turned all his resentment against Sophia who having quitted her supposed lover took her way back again to the house Sir Charles followed her with disordered haste resolved to load her with reproaches for her inconstancy then unwilling to gratify her pride by such an acknowledgment of his weakness he turned back cursing love women and his own ill fate In this temper he wandered about a long time at last he again returned to the inn where after giving orders to have his horses got ready he wrote that letter to Mr Herbert in which he so well disguised the anguish of his heart that the good old man believed his breaking off the affair was the effect of his lightness and inconstancy only though Sophia's quicker penetration easily discovered the latent jealousy that had dictated it  Sir Charles ordered his servant to deliver the letter into Mr Herbert's hands then mounting his horse he bid him follow him as soon as he had executed his commission The young baronet who retired to his country seat to conceal his melancholy and fondly flattered himself that he should soon overcome that fatal passion which had been  the source of so much disgust to him found his mind so cruelly tortured with the remembrance of Sophia that he reassumed his first design of going abroad and unfortunately set out for Dover the day before Mr Herbert's arrival  The good old man being obliged to send Sophia this bad news filled his letter with tender consolations and wise and prudent counsels he exhorted her to bear this stroke of fortune with that dignity of patience which distinguishes the good and wise  The virtue of prosperity said he is temperance the virtue of adversity fortitude it is this last which you are now called upon to exert and which the innocence of your life may well inspire you with for be assured my dear child that it is the greatest consolation under misfortunes to be conscious of having always meant well and to be convinced that nothing but guilt deserves to be considered as a severe evil  Sophia in her answer displayed a mind struggling against its own tenderness offering up its disappointed hopes its griefs and desires in pious sacrifice to the will of Providence and seeking in religion all its consolation and support  Can a virtuous person said she however oppressed by poverty and in consequence neglected by the world be said to want friends and comforters who can look into his own mind with modest approbation and to whom recollection furnishes a source of joy Every good action he has performed is a friend every instance  of pious resignation is a comforter who cheer him with present peace and support him with hopes of future happiness Can he be said to be alone and deprived of the pleasures of society who converses with saints and angels is he without distinction and reward whose life his almighty Creator approves  To be continued  TO THE Author of the

indefatigable industry have given us a most exact historical dictionary of the several Saxon monarchs who successively reigned in the seven kingdoms of Britain Dictionaries are always voluminous but always useful they are lesser libraries and the compilers of them are entitled to the highest acknowledgements from all lovers of learning I have gone through these biographical lexicons which like the chronicles of the kings of Israel give us many barbarous names that tend rather to weary than to indulge our curiosity The times indeed are at such a distance and the face of government has been long since so entirely changed that we are scarce any farther interested in the Saxon heptarchy than as it serves to continue and compleat the line of our English history  Within the space of sixty years from the arrival of Augustine the people of England were entirely converted from paganism to christianity but as in general they had been converted by monks most of them were taught that a monkish life was the  surest and perhaps the only road to heaven and in obedience to this doctrine several of the kings renounced their thrones quitted all commerce with the world and retired into monasteries  The heptarchy is a field where so little grain is to be reaped and where the small produce is mixed and choaked with so many monastic tares and brambles the most succinct and effectual method will be only to mention some of those princes who by remarkable actions or from particular events have particularly deserved the attention of posterity  In the history of Northumberland Edwin distinguished himself more than any other of the Saxon kings He was son of Alla king of Deira but his father dying when he was only three years old Adelfrid king of Bernicia who had married Edwin's sister seized the kingdom of Deira and possessed himself of the orphan's throne By such an union of the two kingdoms Adelfrid became extremely powerful and was able to raise a considerable body of forces against the Welch the Picts and the Scots But the unfortunate Edwin was reduced to the greatest extremities and was in perpetual danger All the princes of England stood in awe of Adelfrid and were afraid to give a sanctuary to his rival till Redwald king of East Anglia from a compassion to Edwin's miserable situation openly received him at his court Adelfrid the Cromwell of those days sent ambassadors to the king of the East Angles to require the surrender of Edwin's person or in case of refusal to threaten an immediate declaration of war Redwald  for some time was staggered and disconcerted by the embassy He found within his breast a struggle between honour and prudence If he protected Edwin he run the hazard of losing his own kingdom if he yielded up a guest whom he had voluntarily received where was the faith of princes who could rely upon the honour of a king This last consideration fortified again by the persuasion of his queen determined Redwald to protect Edwin and not only to protect his person but to take up arms in his defence Courage was the characteristic of those times Redwald Edwin Adelfrid were all equally brave the two former entered the kingdom of Northumberland and came to an engagement with Adelfrid in which the Northumbrians were entirely conquered Adelfrid fell like Cataline  Longe a suis inter hostium cadavera repertus est paululum etiam spirans serociamque animi quam habuerat vivus in vultu retinens  His body was found at a distance from his own troops in the midst of a heap of enemies whom he had slain He still breathed and his features still maintained that fierceness of soul which they had expressed during the vigour of his life  Edwin after the death of Adelfrid by the consent or rather by the gift of Redwald whose troops had gained the conquest took possession of the kingdom of Northumberland His reign during several years was prosperous and except some successless plots against his person was in every respect happy to himself and to his people His spirit and his conduct made him the chief monarch of the heptarchy His laws were executed  with so much efficacy that a child might pass through Northumberland holding open a purse of gold without danger of being robbed He was a pagan when he ascended the throne but after his marriage with Ethelburga sister of the king of Kent he became a christian and in the year was publicly baptized at York  Edwin maintained his dignity with true splendor An ensign in the form of a globe was constantly carried before him as a symbol that in his person was united the heptarchical government What a loss have we in being totally ignorant of his laws for although historians represent him as a prince of great ambition his understanding policy and conduct are remarkably extolled His greatness drew upon him the envy of all the other monarchs in Britain especially of Cadwallo king of Wales and Penda king of Mercia These two princes joined their forces against Edwin who with undaunted bravery and an inferior number of troops gave them battle at Heathfield in Yorkshire The victory seemed to be inclining on the side of the king of Northumberland when his eldest son Offrid was killed by an arrow and fell dead at his father's feet Edwin in the instantaneous rage of a parent lost all his steadiness and presence of mind and rushing with all the violence of despair into the midst of his enemies he soon gained the death which he desired and by his death his subjects the Northumbrians lost the day  The ensuing wars and the confusion that followed in Northumberland are described with all the horrors of devastation and slaughter The  kingdom remained in the utmost misery till it was secured by Oswald the son of Adelfrid who after his father's death had taken refuge in Scotland He is represented as a prince of great virtue and of abilities necessary and proper for a throne He was slain  In the year in the thirtyeighth year of his age  in a battle against an invader of his kingdom Penda king of Mercia who finding among the slain the dead body of Oswald ordered it to be cut into small pieces and each piece to be placed upon a stake as so many visible trophies of victory such was the barbarous rage of those times nor did that barbarity subside unless when it was sometimes changed by the power of the monks into the folly of superstition and the dronishness of indolence To represent such scenes would be only tedious and disagreeable However there are some remaining kings of Northumberland who deserve to be remembered  Among these Egfrid may claim particular notice In the year he succeeded his father Oswy in the kingdom of Bernicia and soon afterwards possessed himself of Deira  Bernicia and Deira were the two parts in which Northumberland was divided  In the year he sent over an army to conquer Ireland The enterprize was frustrated and the Northumbrians were repulsed In the following year he personally attacked Scotland and was joined by a consederate army of Picts his allies soon deserted him and he was compelled to return wounded to his own dominions In the year he endeavoured  to revenge himself against the Picts who retired hastily before him and by that stratagem led him forward into an ambush where he was slain  These instances shew him to have been of a martial aspiring genius he was the first British prince who resisted or rather defied the papal authority The popes had been always looked upon as sacred and infallible but Alfrid paid no regard to their assumed infallibility He deprived Wilfred bishop of York of his bishopric and seized all his possessions which were great even to an amazing degree of opulency Wilfred appealed to the pope the synod of Rome ordered that Wilfred should be restored to his bishopric He returned to England and produced an authentic copy of the sentence Egfrid in a full council of nobility and clergy treated the papal ordinances and jurisdiction not only with contempt but with resentment Wilfred instead of being restored or receiving any kind of compensation was taken into custody and sentenced to a close imprisonment So spirited a resistance against the see of Rome in times so slavishly superstitious ought to be remembered with honour Agatho was then the reigning pope  It is scarce worth while to enter into any particular character of the succeeding kings of Northumberland especially since they will find few who are distinguishably great in the exact catalogue which has been made of them by several of our historians From the death of Egfrid who left no children the Northumbrian kingdom seems  to have declined The succession became uncertain the civil wars encreased so that after the continuance of three hundred and twentyeight years Northumberland torn to pieces by intestine calamities was totally absorbed in the kingdom of Mercia  The next century produced a king of Mercia Offa who rendered himself most eminently renowned in arms with some virtues he had the particular vices which are inseparable from ambition and a boundless thirst of power He was one of those dauntless heroes who imagine that  Whoever will be great must be wicked  Such men will be terrible not beloved They neglect the affection and work only on the fears of the people They may be followed but will never be respected Their actions may strike wonder but cannot excite applause however they are frequently if not always the immediate means made use of by providence to bring about extraordinary revolutions Their success and their greatness make them vain like the fly upon the chariot they imagine that they raise all the dust while the secret hand of heaven turns the wheel  Offa well knew that the first maxim of ambition is an extent of territories he had his eye upon the kingdom of East Anglia Ethelbert a prince of a very amiable character reigned there Offa with the greatest shew of friendship invited him to his court The king of the East Angles accepted the invitation Offa murdered him in the most treacherous manner Ethelbert was the last of his race and with him perished his kingdom It was  united to Mercia after a separate but tributary existence of two hundred and seventeen years  Offa died I think in the year after a reign of thirtynine years in which his many victories rendered him exceeding powerful and tremendous With him perhaps it will be most proper to end the particular account of the heptarchy since although it may be said to have subsisted about thirty years longer till England became subject to one monarch only yet the several kingdoms were so often ravaged their governments disjointed and their boundaries attenuated extended or laid waste that the distant description of such changes must be almost as much confused as the original scenes themselves Mercia held out the longest as the conquests gained by Offa had rendered it very formidable but Mercia yielded at last after having subdued a great part of Kent Sussex Wales and several other provinces in Britain  The heptarchy was so different a form of government from any that had before prevailed and gave so total an alteration to the English state that a summary review of it may not be unacceptable It began as all new systems of empire begin with wisdom and order Whether the Saxons were called in or whether they landed of their own accord is a point not absolutely decided but most certainly some years after their arrival they became our conquerors Some of their battles with the Britons were bloody and cruel their adversaries in their turn shewed little less compassion or humanity When the seven kingdoms were settled and divided the Saxon religion was established  and it seems to have gained considerable ground over christianity till the arrival of St Austin  The outward forms of the Romish church were so much finer and more embellished than the plainer ceremonies of Woden and Thor that the people were easily induced to quit paganism for what was called christianity The ignorance of the times contributed much to their conversion All appearances of learning were centered in the priests and with the true art of sacerdotal cunning they pointed out different paths to heaven according to the different dispositions of the persons who were desirous to travel the road so that after the first monkish times of melancholy and retirement journies were undertaken to Rome miraculous images were gorgeously dressed up various sorts of idolatry were practised in the most public manner with equal devotion by the princes and their subjects of every degree The truth is many of the heptarchical monarchs were either weakly devout or wickedly inhuman governed by hypocritical prelates or governing by lawless tyranny inferior to common sense or superior to all religion and morality tamely submissive or brutally destructive How was it possible for such a government to subsist only by the accidental succession of some kings of abilities and understanding by the prudence of some prelates who at the same time that they supported the church defended the state and by the wise resolutions taken in the wittenagemot or great council of the land During the intestine wars of the heptarchy it is to be presumed that this council could neither  meet so often nor bear so great an influence as in more peaceable and settled times yet it was the most essential institution of the Saxon government Before the arrival of St Austin few records are to be found of it The clergy as they grew more powerful became very leading members in the wittenagemot They appeared and gave their voices in that assembly and at the same time they lost no opportunities of assuming all possible power and prerogatives entirely to themselves so as to become superior to the king in most if not all ecclesiastical affairs Thus in one of the canons passed by a synod anno we find this expression  Neque de hac re aliquid pertineat ad regis saecularis imperium  "With this affair" the government and appointment of abbots abbotesses presbyters and deacons "the king has nothing to do"  But what are become of the native Britons Lost and buried as it were among the Saxons Few very few remaining and those in corners of the island unseen and unknown Unhappy people hidden at home in rocks and fastnesses or driven abroad like vagabonds in quest of habitations destroyed by wars wasted by time wounded by persecution and sunk into eternal oblivion  To the Saxons therefore the present race of English may be said to owe their original those parts of Wales and Cornwall excepted whose inhabitants by their mountainous situation may possibly have flowed in an uninterrupted channel from the Aborigines of our island  It is asserted if I am not mistaken by Bede that now and then a true British chieftain stept into  one of the thrones This might have happened towards the latter end of the heptarchy when all was confusion but the successive line of kings in general consisted of English Saxons not chosen in an hereditary nor absolutely in an elective manner oftner by caprice than by judgment They sometimes succeeded by accident sometimes by cunning sometimes by force Many of them were murdered many were dethroned many fell in battle and many crept into religious cells  Hitherto I have represented the black part of the tablet let us turn to a fairer side The Britons certainly owe the first institution of order and government to the Saxons The Saxons owe the first institution of their churchgovernment to St Austin Their civil policy which they transplanted with them had been long established in Germany it was Gothick but it was regular As soon as they settled themselves in England a king became an additional part of their constitution The contract between the king and his people was mutual they were bound to defend each other the properties on both sides were ascertained the people had their patrimonies the king had his regalities  The nobility were next to the king in dignity This high rank could only be attained by remarkable and brave actions either by great atchievements in war or by sagacity and wisdom in peace The honour when attained went in succession to the next heir but was still to be forfeited by baseness and degeneracy  The subsequent order of people were the freemen they were joined in judicature with the nobility  they were above all arbitrary power nor were they liable to any compulsive law to which they did not voluntarily give their consent They were much more numerous than the nobles and consequently were the chief bulwarks of legal justice and every other branch of liberty They were divided into two sets being chosen to the rank of freemen either from their superior merit or from their great military service and the large possessions which they had gained in war  The inferior and meanest classes of the Saxons were in a state of bondage subject to the will disposition and commands of their landlords They were called villains because the lands which they occupied were held in villenage or servitude These were the only people who were exempted from the power of voting in the wittenagemot  One of these councils convened by Ina king of the West Saxons is entitled  Consilium omnium sapientum senicrum et populorum totius regni  A council of all the wise men the elders and the people of the whole kingdom  In another council convened at Winchester in the year it is said to have been held in presence of the great men  alixum fidelium infinita multitudine  And of an infinite number of other faithful freemen  The inconveniencies arising from so general and unlimited a privilege must have been very great  I have so often mentioned the Picts that before we quit entirely a view of the heptarchy it may be necessary to attempt some account of their original Authors differ widely upon the point some are of opinion that the Picts broke in upon  Scotland at a time when the Caledonians were in a reduced languishing state unable to defend themselves Bishop Stillingfleet imagines that they came from European Scythia  Strabo as also Diodorus and Pliny supposes that Scythia Europrea extended to the utmost bounds of the north and includes among the Scythians the antient inhabitants of Norway Sweden Denmark the Daci Getae c INNES'S Essays page  others suppose that they arrived from a different part of the northern continent The most probable conjecture is Tyrrhel's  Tyrrhel page and  he says  That the Picts were the remainder of those Britons who preserved their liberty by resisting the Roman arms and were at last divided from the Roman Britons by a wall now called the Picts wall the vestiges of which are to be seen to this day drawn between the mouths of the rivers Tyne and Eske to hinder their farther incursions into those parts which were then under the Roman empire  They may be said to be the same people with the Caledonians as the Welch are said to be the same people with the English They were a colony who kept themselves separated from the main body and were distinguished from the rest of the Scots by the name of Picts as they continued the custom which originally had been common to all the British islands of painting their bodies with various figures even after that practice had been long neglected and laid aside by all the rest of the Britons The perpetual incursions of the Picts into the more southern parts of the island may have proceeded from an  one a more composed and regular system of government presented itself to view  The heptarchy was a fabric which for some years had been growing too heavy for itself Several of the partitions which had been framed and fitted within it had either burst asunder or were forcibly destroyed The building had been tottering long before it fell A skilful artist was wanting to gather up the best materials and to form a new edifice of magnificence and duration Such an architect was found in the person of Egbert king of the West Saxons  To be continued  THE HISTORY OF THE COUNT DE COMMINGE CONTINUED  BE not apprehensive of any harm said he to me as he approached I come by the command of madame de Benavides she has had esteem enough for me to trust me with every thing relating to you probably added he with a sigh which he could not suppress she would have judged differently if she had known me well but I will be just to her confidence I will save you and I will save her if I can  You shall not save me replied I it is my duty to justify the innocence of madame de Benavides and I will do it at the expence of a thousand lives if I had them to lose  I then acquainted him with my design of keeping myself concealed and passing for an assassin to prevent any imputation falling upon her  This project might be necessary replied Don Gabriel if my brother was dead as I perceive you think but his wound although great is probably not mortal and the first sign of life and  sense he gave was to order that madame de Benavides should be confined to her own apartment this proves that he suspects you are her lover and if you persist in your design you will lose your own life without preserving hers Let us go added he the safety I offer you today I probably cannot afford you tomorrow  And what will become of madame de Benavides cried I no I can never resolve to withdraw myself from danger and to leave her in it  I have already told you replied Don Gabriel that your presence will only render her situation worse  Well said I sighing I will fly since you will have it so and that her interest demands it I had hoped that by the sacrifice I had intended to make her of my life I should at least have been pitied by her but I deserve not to have this consolation I am an unhappy wretch who am not even worthy to die for her Protect her added I to Don Gabriel the tears streaming from my eyes as I spoke you are generous her innocence her misfortunes must move you  You may judge said he by what has escaped me that I am too much for my own quiet concerned in the fate of madame de Benavides I will do every thing for her Alas added he I should have thought myself well paid if I could have hoped that she had loved no one How is it possible that you should not be satisfied with your good fortune in having touched a heart like hers but let us go pursued he let us take advantage of the night  Then taking my hand  and turning a dark lanthorn he led me through the courts of the castle Transported with rage against myself for what I had done in the wildness of my despair I wished myself still more miserable than I was  Don Gabriel when he left me advised me to retire to a convent of religious which was within a quarter of a league of the castle  You must said he keep yourself concealed in their house for some days that you may not be in danger from the search I myself shall be obliged to make for you and here is a letter for one of those religious which will procure you admission into the house  I loitered a long time about the castle after he left me not being able to remove myself from the place where Adelaida was at length the desire of hearing all that happened to her determined me to set out for the convent I arrived there just at daybreak the religious to whom I presented Don Gabriel's letter received me very civilly and conducted me into a chamber near his own My paleness and the blood he observed on my cloaths made him apprehensive that I was wounded He was beginning to enquire after my health when I fainted away With the assistance of a servant he put me to bed and sent for a surgeon belonging to the convent to examine my wound he declared that it was in a dangerous condition through the fatigue and cold I had suffered  When I was alone with the good father to whom I was recommended I intreated him to send to a house in a certain village which I named to him  to enquire for Saint Laurent for I supposed he would take refuge there I was not mistaken he came with the messenger I had sent to him the poor fellow was in excessive affliction when he heard that I was wounded he approached my bedside and anxiously enquired how I did  If you would save my life said I to him you must learn in what state madame de Benavides is inform yourself of all that has passed haste lose not a moment and remember that what I suffer in this uncertainty is ten thousand times worse than death  Saint Laurent promised to do every thing I desired and went away to take proper measures to satisfy me  Mean time I was seized with a violent fever my wound grew more dangerous they were obliged to make great incisions but the torments of my mind made me almost insensible to those of my body the image of madame de Benavides bathed in tears as I had seen her when I left her chamber and kneeling by her husband whom I had wounded was continually before my eyes I took a review of the misfortunes of her life I found myself in all her marriage to which she was forced on my account her fatal choice of the most jealous and brutal man in the world for a husband was made for my sake and I had lately compleated all her misfortunes by exposing her reputation to injurious censures I called to my remembrance the unjust jealousy I had discovered which although it had lasted but a few moments and was banished by a single word from her yet I could never pardon myself for Adelaida could not but think  me unworthy of her esteem she could do no otherwise than hate me  Saint Laurent returned the next day he informed me that Benavides was still extremely ill of his wound that Adelaida was in the utmost affliction and that Don Gabriel made a shew of seeking for me every where This news was not very likely to calm the perturbation of my mind I know not what I ought to wish for every thing was against me I could not even wish for death I thought I owed the prolonging of my wretched life to the justification of madame de Benavides  The good father to whom I was recommended beheld me with great compassion he heard me sigh continually and always found my face bathed in tears He was a man of sense and politeness who had been long in the world and whom a concurrence of strange accidents had driven into a cloister he did not endeavour to reason me out of my grief or to console me by the usual methods he only expressed great sensibility of my misfortunes This way succeeded by degrees he entirely gained my confidence perhaps also I only wanted an opportunity to speak and to complain to him I conceived so great an affection and esteem for him that I related to him my whole story He became so necessary to me after a few days stay in the convent that I could not bear him to be absent from me a moment I never met with a man that had more goodness of heart I repeated to him the same things a thousand times over he always listened to me with the utmost attention and sympathised in all my griefs  It was through him that I learned every thing that passed in the house of Benavides he had been in great danger from his wound but it was at length cured I was informed of it by Don Jerome so was my friend the religious called He afterwards told me that all seemed quiet in the castle that madame de Benavides lived more retired than before and that she was in a very languishing state of health He added that I must resolve to remove as soon as I was able for if it should be discovered that I was concealed there it would expose the lady to new distresses  It was not likely that I should be soon in a condition to leave the convent I was wasting away with a continual fever and my wound was not yet healed I had been in this religious house above two months when one day I observed Don Jerome to be pensive and melancholy he always turned his eyes away when they met mine he seemed studiously to avoid looking at me and with difficulty answered my questions I had conceived a very tender friendship for him misfortunes give sensibility to the heart I was going to express my concern for his uneasiness and to enquire into the cause when Saint Laurent entering my chamber told me that Don Gabriel was in the convent and that he had just met him  Don Gabriel here said I looking at Don Jerome and you never to mention to me his coming what is the meaning of this reserve you fill me with the most dreadful apprehensions what is become of madame de Benavides for pity draw me out of this cruel uncertainty  "Would I could leave you always in it" said Don Jerome at length embracing me  Ah cried I she is dead Adelaida is dead Benavides has sacrificed her to his rage You answer me notalas then I have nothing to hope Ah it was not Benavides but I who have plunged the poniard into her breast had it not been for my fatal passion she might have been still aliveAdelaida is dead I shall never behold her moreI have lost her for ever she is dead and I still live why do I not follow her why do I delay to revenge her upon her murderer alas death would be too great an indulgence to me it would separate me from myself and I am made up of horror and anguish  The violent agitation I was in caused my wound which was not well healed to open again I lost so much blood that I fell into a swoon which lasted so long that they thought me dead but after continuing several hours in this happy state of insensibility I woke to grief unutterable Don Jerome apprehensive that I should make an attempt upon my own life charged Saint Laurent to watch me with the strictest attention My despair now took another form I complained not I shed not a tear then it was that I formed a resolution to go and inhabit some solitude where I might without controul deliver myself up a prey to my affliction  I was desirous of seeing Don Gabriel for I eagerly caught every thing that could heighten my despair I intreated Don Jerone to bring him and the next day they came together into my chamber Don Gabriel seated himself upon the side of my bed  We continued along time silent neither of us was able to speak he looked upon me with eyes swimming in tears  You are very generous monsieur said I at length to visit a wretch whom you have so much reason to hate  You are too miserable replied he to make it possible for me to hate you  Ah cried I tell me I beseech you every circumstance of my misfortunes leave me ignorant of nothing the explanation I desire of you may possibly prevent my taking some measures which you have an interest to hinder  I shall redouble your affliction and my own replied he but I cannot help itI will satisfy you and in the recital I am going to make you you will find you are not the only person to be pitied Take then the incidents in order as they happened we shall too soon come to the melancholy catastrophe  I had never seen madame de Benavides till she became my sisterinlaw My brother who had some affairs of consequence to settle at Bourdeaux saw her there and fell in love with her and although he had several rivals whose birth and riches were superior to his yet madame de Benavides for reasons I never could guess at preferred him to them all A short time after their marriage he brought her to his estate in Biscay and there it was that I saw her for the first time if her beauty excited my admiration I was still more charmed with the graces of her mind and the extreme sweetness of her temper which my brother put every day to new trials  However the passion I then had for a very amiable young person made me believe that I was secured from the influence of her charms which it was impossible to behold without love I even designed to make use of my sisterinlaw's interest with my brother to prevail upon him to consent to our marriage The father of my mistress offended at my brother's refusal had given me but a very short time to bring him to a compliance declaring that when it was expired he would marry his daughter to another  The friendship and esteem which madame de Benavides expressed for me gave me courage to implore her assistance I often went to her apartment with an intention to speak to her but the slightest obstacle imaginable restrained me Mean while the time which had been prescribed to me drew towards a period I had received several letters from my mistress in which she prest me to use every method to gain my brother's consent My answers did not satisfy her without my perceiving it an air of coldness ran through them which drew many complaints from her these complaints appeared to me to be unjust and I reproached her with it She now believed herself abandoned and resentment joined to the commands of her father determined her to marry the person he proposed to her She herself in a letter she wrote to me informed me of her marriage she reproached me but it was with tenderness and concluded with earnestly intreating me never to see her more I had loved her passionately I imagined I still  loved her and I could not learn that I had lost her for ever without feeling a real affliction I was afraid she was unhappy and I reproached myself with being the cause of it Absorbed with these reflections I continued walking in a melancholy manner in the little wood which you used often to visit there I was met by madame de Benavides who observing my uneasiness kindly desired to know the cause of it A secret repugnance which I felt within myself restrained me from telling her I could not resolve to own to her that I had been in love but the pleasure of speaking to her of that passion carried it over that consideration All these emotions passed in my heart without my perceiving the cause as yet I had not dared to examine into the nature of what I felt for my sisterinlaw I related my story to her I shewed her the letter which Isabella had wrote me  Why did you not mention this sooner to me said madame de Benavides perhaps I might have been able to obtain the consent of your brother though he refused it to you My God how much I pity you how greatly I am concerned for her she doubtless will be miserable  The compassion which madame de Benavides expressed for Isabella made me apprehensive that she would think hardly of me as the person who had made her unhappy To diminish therefore this compassion I eagerly told her that the husband of Isabella was a man of birth and merit that he held a very considerable rank in  the world and that it was highly probable his fortune would be still more so  You are deceived answered my lovely sisterinlaw if you think all these advantages can make her happy nothing can make a mends for the loss of what one loves It is a cruel misfortune added she when we are obliged to act contrary to our inclination to comply with our duty  She sighed several times during this conversation I even perceived that it was with difficulty she restrained her tears She left me soon afterwards I had not power to follow her I remained in a trouble and confusion I am not able to describe I now for the first time perceived what I had hitherto industriously concealed from myself that I was in love with my sisterinlaw and I thought I could discover a secret passion in her heart a thousand circumstances then rushed upon my memory which before I had given no attention to her taste for solitude her indifference for all those amusements which make the delight of persons of her sex and age Her extreme melancholy which I had attributed to my brother's bad treatment of her now seemed to me to proceed from another cause How many sad reflections now rose in my mind I found myself in love with a person whom I ought not to love and this person's heart in the possession of another  If she loved nothing said I my passion although without hope would not be without sweetness I might pretend to the blessing of her friendship in that I would place my felicity But this friendship will not satisfy my heart  since she has sentiments more tender for another I was sensible I ought to use my utmost endeavours to vanquish a passion so dangerous to my quiet and which honour would not permit me to entertain I took a resolution to fly from my too lovely sister and I returned to the castle to tell my brother that some affairs called me from him but the sight of madame de Benavides left me no power to follow the dictates of my reason All my resolutions vanished into air yet to furnish myself with some pretence to continue near her I persuaded myself that I was necessary to her in being sometimes able to calm the tempestuous humour of her husband About this time you arrived I found in your air and behaviour somewhat greatly above the condition you appeared in I treated you with familiarity and kindness I would have entered into your confidence and have made you my friend My intention was to prevail upon you afterwards to draw a picture of madame de Benavides for me for notwithstanding the delusive reasons my passion found for staying with my sister yet I resolved some time or other to leave the castle but in this separation so just so necessary I was willing at least to have her picture The manner in which you received the advances I made you shewed me that I had nothing to hope for from you and I was gone to bring another painter into the house that unhappy day when you wounded my brother Judge of my surprise at my return when I was informed of what had happened My brother who was desperately  kept a gloomy silence casting from time to time a terrible look upon madame de Benavides As soon as he saw me he called me to his bedside Deliver me said he from the sight of a woman who has betrayed me cause her to be conducted to her own apartment and give strict orders not to suffer her to stir out of it  I would have said something against this rigorous order to my brother but he interrupted me at the first word  Do as I desire you said he or never see me more I was obliged to obey and approaching my sisterinlaw I intreated her to let me speak to her in her own chamber Let us go said she weeping execute the order you have received  These words which had the air of a reproach pierced me to the soul I durst not make her any answer in the place we were then in but no sooner had I led her to her chamber than looking on her with that grief and tenderness my heart was full of what madam said I do you confound me with your persecutor I who feel your trouble as sensible as you do yourself I who would sacrifice my life to save you I grieve to say it but I tremble for you retire for some time to a place of safety I will endeavour to have you conducted wherever you please provided it is a secure asylum from your furious husband  I know not whether monsieur de Benavides has any design to take away my life but I know it is my duty not to abandon him and I will  fulfil it though I perish  Then after a short pause me added  I am going by placing an entire confidence in you to give you the greatest mark of my esteem it is in my power to give and indeed the confession I have to make you is necessary to preserve yours for me But go and attend your brother a longer conversation may make you suspected by him return hither as soon as you conveniently can  I obeyed madame de Benavides and went to my brother's apartment the surgeon had visited him and desired that no one might be allowed to come into his chamber I flew back again to his wife agitated with a thousand different thoughts I was anxious to know what she had to say to me and yet I feared to hear it She related to me the manner in which she became acquainted with you the passion you conceived for her the moment you saw her the generous sacrifice you had made her and she did not conceal the tenderness with which you had inspired her  Ah interupted I have I then been dear to the most perfect woman upon earth and have I lost her  This idea filled my soul with such tender sorrow that my tears which had hitherto been restrained by the excess of my despair began now to stream in great abundance from my eyes  Yes continued Don Gabriel with a sigh you were beloved Good heaven what tenderness did I not discover for you in her heart Notwithstanding her misfortunes and the horror of her present situation I perceived that she indulged  with pleasure the thought that her affection for you was authorised by what you had done for her She confessed to me that when I led her into the chamber where you was painting she knew you and that she had wrote to you to command you to leave the castle but that she could not find an opportunity to give you her letter she afterwards related to me how her husband had surprised you together at the very moment when you was bidding her an eternal farewel that he attempted to kill her but that you interposed and wounded him in defending her  Save this unhappy man added she you only can preserve him from the fate that waits him for I know that in the fear of exposing me to the least suspicion he will suffer the most cruel death rather than declare who he is  He is well rewarded for all he can suffer madam replied I by the good opinion you have of him  I have owned my weakness to you said she but you have seen that if I am not mistress of my affections I have at least been so of my conduct and that I have taken no steps which the most rigorous virtue could condemn  Alas madam interupted I it is not necessary that you should condescend to justify yourself to me Too well am I convinced by my own experience that it is not always in our power to dispose of our own hearts I will use my utmost endeavours to obey you and deliver the count de Comminge but oh madam permit me to  assure you that I am more miserable than he is  I left the room as I pronounced these words without daring to raise my eyes to madame de Benavides I shut myself up in my own chamber to consider what I had to do I had already taken a resolution to deliver you but I was doubtful whether I ought not to fly from the castle myself The torments I had suffered during the relation madame de Benavides had made me shewed me the excess of my passion for her It was necessary that I should suppress sentiments so dangerous to our virtue and in order to suppress them it was necessary I should see her no more but it seemed cruel to abandon her in such a distressful situation to leave her unprotected in the hands of a husband who believed himself wronged by her After continuing long irresolute I determined at once to assist madame de Benavides and to avoid seeing her as much as possible I could not inform her of your escape till next day she seemed to be a little more easy on your account but I thought I could perceive that her grief was increased and I doubted not but the declaration I had made of my sentiments was the cause I quitted her immediately in order to free her from the embarrassment my presence threw her into I was several days without seeing her my brother grew worse and his physician thought him in great danger I was obliged to make her a visit to acquaint her with this news  If I had lost Monsieur Benavides said she in the ordinary methods of providence his death would have less sensibly affected me but the part I have unfortunately had in it makes it an insupportable affliction to me I am not apprehensive of the ill treatment I may meet with from him I am only afraid of his dying in a persuasion that I have wronged him If he lives I may hope that he will one day be convinced of my innocence and restore me to his esteem  Suffer me madam said I to endeavour to merit yours I implore your pardon for these sentiments I have dared to let you perceive I was not able to prevent their birth or to conceal them from you I even know not whether I can subdue them but I swear to you that I will never importune you with them I had taken a resolution to fly from you but your interest retains me here  I confess to you replied Madame de Benavides that you have given me great uneasiness Fortune seemed desirous of taking from me the consolation I have found in your friendship  The tears she shed when she spoke to me were more powerful than all the efforts of my reason I was ashamed of having augmented the miseries of one already so unhappy  No madam replied I you shall never be deprived of that friendship you have the goodness to set some value upon and I will endeavour to render myself worthy of yours by my solicitude to make you forget the extravagance I have been guilty of  In effect when I left her I found myself more calm and easy than I had ever been since I first beheld her Far from leaving her I endeavoured by the resolutions I vowed to take when in her presence to furnish myself with arguments for performing my duty This method succeeded I accustomed myself by degrees to reduce my former sentiments to friendship and esteem I told her ingenuously the progress I made in my cure She thanked me for it as for some consideble service I had rendered her and to reward me gave me every day new marks of her confidence Still my heart would sometimes revolt but reason always got the victory My brother after languishing a long time at length began to recover he would never be prevailed upon to give his wife permission to see him though she often requested it He was not yet in a condition to leave his chamber when Madame de Benavides fell ill in her turn Her youth saved her this time and I was full of hope that her illness had softened her husband's heart for though he had continued obstinately resolute not to see her during his own danger notwithstanding her earnest entreaties yet he shewed some solicitude in enquiring for her when she was ill She was almost recovered when my brother ordered me to be called to him  To be continued  TREATISE ON THE EDUCATION of DAUGHTERS CONTINUED  Indirect Instructions and that Children ought not to be urged  NOW though we ought not to make a practice of threatning and never punishing lest our threats become contemptible yet should not punishment be as often inflicted as threatned and as to punishments the pain ought to be as light as possible but accompanied with all circumstances that may affect the child with shame and remorse for instance shew him what you have done to avoid coming to that extremity appear concerned at it speak in his hearing of the misfortune of people that are so wanting in reason and honour as to call for punishment abate of your usual kindness till you perceive he stands in need of consolation let the punishment be either public or private as you shall judge it most for his benefit either to put him to great shame or to let him see that you choose to spare him let a public exposure be in reserve for the last remedy  Sometimes make use of a discreet person to comfort the child and say such things to him as will not be proper for yourself to speak one that may cure him of that false shame and dispose him to seek your favour one to whom he may in his concern open his heart with more freedom than he can do in your presence but above all let it never appear that you require aught more than the necessary submission so endeavour to manage that he shall condemn himself readily and freely insomuch that it may be your part to mollify the pain he shall have felt these general rules may be employed as each particular case requires Men and more especially children are not at all times the same what is good for them today will be dangerous to morrow a conduct invariably uniform cannot be useful The fewer formal lessons we make use of the better a thousand instructions more beneficial than what lessons afford may be insinuated by the means of sprightly conversation  I have seen several children learn to read in diverting themselves one need only relate some pleasant stories out of a book in their presence to teach them to know the letters insensibly after this they will of themselves be eager to get at the source of what has given them so much entertainment There are two things which do great mischief one is that they must presently be put to read in Latin which robs them of all the pleasure of reading the other that they are used to read with a forced and ridiculous emphasis or accent It will be right to supply them with a book handsomely bound even gilt on the edges with pretty  figures in it and of a good type Whatever delights the fancy is an assistance to study endeavour to choose him one that shall contain a number of stories short and surprising this done fear not but he will learn to read Neither teaze him to do it exactly well let him pronounce in his natural way as he speaks other tones are always bad and taste of collegiate declamation When in time his tongue shall be at liberty his breast stronger and the habit of reading more enlarged he will perform it without trouble to himself more gracefully and more distinctly  They should be taught to write nearly after the same method When children know a little how to read one may make it a diversion to them to form their letters and where there are several of them it is good to stir up an emulation they have a propensity to making figures upon paper assist this inclination a little without constraining them and they will learn to form the letters by way of play and by degrees come to write One may also incite them by proposing some kind of reward that shall be agreeable to their taste and innocent in its nature  Let me see you write a letter one may say acquaint your brother or your cousin with that affair All this pleases the child provided no frightful appearance of a set task comes to molest him St Austin says upon his own experience that a free curiosity allowed is a much greater incitement to the spirit of a child than formal rules and compulsion derived from fear  There is one remarkable and great fault in the course of common education that is all the pleasure is supposed to lie on one side all the pain on the other in study all the pain in diversion all the pleasure What will a child naturally do but be impatient under the prescribed rule and run eagerly to his diversion therefore let us try to change the order of these things and make application agreeable under the disguise of liberty and pleasure let us suffer them to break off in little sallies of play These interruptions are necessary in order to refresh their minds let their eyes wander a while let them digress or trifle a little to disencumber themselves and after that we may gently bring them back to the subject  To require an uninterupted application to their studies does them a great deal of mischief it is common for governors to affect this exact regularity because it is more for their ease and conveniency than to be obliged to lie in watch for the more serviceable moments At the same time whatever diversions we allow them let us see they are such as have not the least tendency to throw them into passions whatever will refresh the mind or afford an agreeable variety or please their curiosity in useful subjects or practise their limbs in any commendable art that is the proper matter of children's diversions and they are best pleased with such as consist of bodily motion so they do but change place a shuttlecock a bowl is enough Neither need we be at much trouble about what will please them for they will invent for themselves It is sufficient to let them proceed their own way  to look on with a pleasant countenance and to interpose when they seem to grow too warm  It would be good to give them a notion so far as they will receive it of the pleasures which the understanding affords as conversation news histories and divers games of application that contain some instruction All this will have its use in time but we must not force a taste for these things we must only make them the offer the time will come when their bodies will be less disposed to motion their minds more active In the mean time the care we shall take care to season employments of a serious nature with the relish of pleasure will be a great means to abate the propensity of youth to dangerous entertainments It is subjection and uneasiness that excite such an impatience for diversion where a girl is not uneasy in her mother's presence she will have no such violent desire to get away and look out for worse company  As to the choice of diversions all society capable of doing harm is to be avoided No boys among girls nor even girls that have not an orderly turn of mind All plays that are apt to dissipate or transport the thoughts or that accustom the body to gestures unbecoming a girl all frequent excursions from home and all conversations likely to excite a desire of such excursions are to be avoided carefully  So long as we continue unprejudiced by any high entertainment so long as no violent passions have sprung up in us we are easily susceptible of delight Health and innocence will produce it for they are true sources of it whereas they who have unfortunately been habituated to the perceptions  of violent pleasures lose the sense for more moderate ones and fret themselves in a perpetual uneasy search after joy  Our taste for entertainment is spoiled as is our taste for victuals we so accustom ourselves to things of a quick relish that ordinary meats and plain become flat and insipid Let us then be fearful of those strong sensations which are but preparations to uneasiness and disgust they are more especially to be feared for children who are less able to resist what they feel and love to be affected let us keep them in the taste for plain things no high seasoned food for their support nor entertainments for their delight Sobriety itself ever bestows sufficient appetite without the provocation of sauces which betray us to intemperance A certain antient hath said The very best artificer of pleasure is temperance that temperance which is the health both of body and mind under whose influence we feel ourselves in a state of gentle and moderate delight without wanting the contrivance of machinery or public shows or expence for its production A game of our own invention a book some task undertaken a pleasant walk an innocent conversation as a refreshment after we have been employed afford a more pure perception of delight than the finest concert of musick  To be continued  The EPHEMERON or  DAYFLY in his several Changes  PHILOSOPHY FOR THE LADIES CONTINUED  The Natural History

induces to follow her into her inmost recesses and examine even into the extremest minutiae of her works The titles of gimcrack cockleshell merchant fly hunter c are lavishly bestowed on them by such as either ignorance indolence or a natural want of curiosity have excluded from the great garden of nature they find no amusement or instruction in a box of cockleshells a bundle of weeds or a cluster of caterpillars for so in general terms are all the objects of natural enquiry stiled by them and therefore conclude that neither is capable of being drawn from them and consequently  to what use is all this  is ever their general cry  But the real philosopher the man of clear reflection and accurate discernment who traverses every path and explores every winding of this regular wilderness will meet not only with entertainment but also with great improvement from every object that he sees Each step he takes a text presents itself from which his genius may draw out a sermon of admirable service to his fellowcreatures Nor can the apparent insignificance of the subjects in themselves render the lesson they convey the less important but quite the contrary For if in the minutest animals we perceive the care and wisdom of an infinite power exerted for their formation and protection if we perceive them endued with all those faculties which are or can be necessary for their preservation and those faculties even most punctually employed to the purposes for which they were intended with what an awe and adoration ought it to turn our thoughts towards the great Creator of them all with what gratitude should it inspire our hearts for him who has still so much more taken care for us and bestowed on us faculties and powers so greatly superior to the rest of his creatures and lastly with how much selfreproach should it fill us when we consider that from a misapplication of those powers we so frequently defeat the allwise designs of heaven and even render them more fallible than the uncorrupted instinct even of the smallest reptile  In short there is no object from which the speculative man may not deduce a lesson or on which he may not moralize with advantage Nay useless as the study of natural history may now appear to the unlearned yet let them seriously reflect from  whence they have acquired some of their most valuable improvements to whom they stand indebted for their most useful arts and they will find them owing to observations of this kind made by men in the more early periods of the world and that the greatest part of that genius which man so proudly boasts of is very little more than the noticed instinct of other animals improved upon by his own reason  To instance only in a very few examplesWho taught us the art of building but the beaver who that of spinning but the silk worm of weaving but the spider of navigation but the nautilus are not the faculties of the mind also greatly to be improved by observation of other animals can the necessity of regular subordination and strictness of government be better pointed out than in that of the bees do not the ants instruct us in industry and frugality or can we observe the lionpismire without being taught a noble lesson of patience and perseverance  But if reflection and moral contemplation are to be sought for in these researches what object offers an ampler scope for them than the animal which I am now going to introduce to the acquaintance of my fair readert for what can possibly afford a more just idea of the real value of time and the necessity of employing every moment of it to the best advantage than the observing a creature whose whole allotted period of life is no more than the space of five hours and that in the general not half attained to but cut off in the middle by some insidious enemy who lies in wait to destroy it  This fly for in the flystate only is it to be considered in this view is called by the authors who have written concerning it by the names of the ephemeron hemerobios and diaria all which mean no more than an animal of but a single day's existence It is a native of Germany and appears every year for about three days successively fluttering on the surface of the water at the mouths of the Rhine the Meuse the Wael the Leck and the Ysel about the middle of June But this continued appearance of them is kept up by a regular succession for those who begin to live and flutter about towards the noon of the first day are dead before night a new set makes its appearance on the second and the third in like manner is supplied by a fresh generation After which no more of them are to be seen till the succeeding year renews this three day's phaenomenon  Altho' the life of the ephemeron in its flystate which we shall more particularly dwell on hereafter is so extremely short yet as it has an existence under another form and in another element which continues through a space of three years it will be necessary that we should dwell a little on its history during that period and relate the manner of its several changes  In short although this animal when arrived at the state of full perfection is an enlivened flutterer of the airy regions yet his original existence is in the waters where the eggs being deposited by the female aed impregnated by the male in the same manner as the spawn of fishes are scattered over the muddy bottoms of the rivers by the motion of the water and there deposited in that bed which  is the most proper for their being hatched and brought into life  As these eggs are not united together by any glutinous or gelatinous substance nor deposited in clusters as the spawn of the frog of the watersnail and of several other insects but entirely dispersed and separate from each other it is no very easy matter to ascertain how long it is before the insect contained within them acquires life and breaks through its shelly integument It is sufficient to observe that after a certain period they produce a little worm with six legs which at one year's growth is of the size and form represented in the annexed plate at Fig I At this age it is not only without wings or those prominences which cover the wings but also without the least signs or vestiges of any such part When they come to be two years old the little sheaths of the wings appear very plainly and the animal then very greatly enlarged in bulk appeas as at Fig II And when it has reached its third year at which time it is to undergo its grand metamorphosis these cases are then as conspicuous as possible resembling a little flower that increases by degrees and is ready to break out of its cup Its appearance is then such as is shewn in Fig III  This animal is made great use of by the fishermen by whom it is called by the name of bankbait for although they can swim very swiftly yet it is seldom that they do so but are always found near the banks of rivers and there live in the most quiet parts The more mud there is at the bottom out of which they first rise the greater number of the worms are usually to be met  with Yet are they very rarely to be found either lying on the mud or adhering to it but they live within the mud or clay itself in hollows made oblong and smooth and which they constantly bore not obliquely or perpendicularly but ever parallel to the horison each several animal living in a separate cell  The worm of the ephemeron as soon as it hatched from the egg prepares for the building of these cells or houses which they make larger and larger as the size of their body increases so that the full grown worms are always to be found in larger the younger in smaller tubes For this purpose nature has furnished them with parts particularly adapted thereto their two forelegs being formed in some measure like those of the mole or mole cricket and their jaws furnished with two teeth somewhat like the forcipes or claws of crabs which are of great service to their making their way into the mud  If you throw some of them into a little mud mixed with water you will instantly perceive them begin this work of piercing and boring and if the quantity of mud you give them is not sufficient entirely to immerge them they will nevertheless continue to undermine what they have hiding at one time their heads at another their bodies and at others their tails in the attempt to form new cells  In these cells then the worm of the ephemeron continues till the time when it is to undergo its final metamorphosis which as I have before observed is at the period of three years previous to which the cases of the wings appear very protuberant  on the back the smooth and depressed form of the upper part of the body is changed into a more swollen and rounder shape and the wings themselves become in some degree visible through their external skin  At the time that this metamorphosis is to begin which is generally about six o'clock in the evening the worm quits his cell and goes into the water from the bottom of which he immediately makes all the expedition he can to the surface and there fixing on any thing solid that he can meet with either wood stone earth a tree a boat a beast or a man all appearing equally indifferent to him he appears to be seized all over with a shuddering or trembling motion when immediately the skin opens on the middle of the back the slit enlarging towards the fore parts till it becomes so wide that the animal is able to thrust his head out at it after which he draws his legs also out of the skin as in Fig IV whilst the claws adhering to the cast skin are in the mean time firmly fixed in their places which greatly contributes towards enabling him to slip the rest of his body out of its covering It must moreover be observed that the head and legs are stript of their skin in the same manner that we draw our feet out of our shoes but that as to the other parts that is to say the first and second pair of wings the skin is drawn off from them in such a manner as that they become turned inside out as we invert a limber pair of gloves the inward surface or inside of the fingers being pulled out so that the exuvium or case which is left behind bears the form represented at Fig V  When it has thus quitted its case and consequently compleated its change it appears a perfect fly with two pair of very fine filmy wings as at Fig VI  The Plate referred to will be given in our Next  From this period then may be dated the commencement of its life the whole duration of which afterwards is never more than about five hours in which short space it generates lays eggs grows old and dies That is to say if it even reaches to the extent of that very short allotted space for short as it is it is frequently cut off before the conclusion of it by the means of some of the very numerous enemies whereby this innocent unhappy little creature is persecuted in the course of it Fond as it were of the element from whence he sprung no sooner is his change compleated than he instantly repairs to it again and flutters towards its surface where if he ventures too near he becomes an easy prey to the trout and many other kinds of fish who watch to take him and to whom he is a most delicious morsel and if he soars higher into the air he is as liable to be snapp'd up by the birds who are no less fond of him They frequently even seize and devour him whilst he is engaged in the great work of changing his skin nay numbers of the worms are destroyed by the inhabitants of the waters in their very birth before they can reach the surface to become the tenants of a purer element  Such so short and so full of peril is the life of this harmless little insect and such O man is thine  THE LADY's MUSEUM  The TRIFLER NUMBER IX  Dear Mrs TRIFLER  _I Cannot help suspecting that you artfully mean to cajole your fair readers into sense and seriousness and that you only bait your periodical labours with a Trifler merely to captivate our attention while you mean nothing less than our acquaintance with all useful and polite literature Notwithstanding this pretty stratagem of yours which is like teaching children their letters by gingerbread alphabets we are resolved to disappoint your endeavours and the purpose of this letter is to inform you of the very pernicious consequences which must necessarily result from your projected reformation  There is one general argument which has always appeared to me unanswerable upon this subject if we poor women furnished our minds with moral and historical truth and took pains to acquire the true principles of taste and criticism we should be very apt upon this supposition to discern the deficiencies of our admirers in these articles and from a total dissimilitude of manners and pursuits grow quickly disgusted at each other and so risk our establishments for the sake of accomplishments no longer respected  Pray madam have you ever known any ladies advantageously settled in life on account of their mental qualifications where the metallic charms were wanting I question extremely whether even a precedent could be found for so irregular a proceeding so true it is what the poet sings  Wit must wear the willow with the bays  Indeed my dear you entirely mistake the point a woman of knowledge is at present no object of request and I am afraid literature like virtue is insufficient for its own rewardso well satisfied is the whole tribe of Triflers of this maxim that there is not one of them who would not rather endanger their health and impair their sight by needlework than read ten pages of English history or acquaint themselves with the very rudiments of the religion of their country  Your ladies of literature were commonly susceptible of tenderness for I have looked into a translation of Ovid's Epistles and this is a quality the Triflers have totally divested themselves of I suppose  you would endeavour by enlarging our ideas to soften and refine our affections but that would be the most unfortunate thing in the world for us for I can assure you we have already more light in our minds than is friendly to our pursuits and desires and we are not a little incommoded by its impertinent suggestions  You know that our whole family has a mortal antipathy to every thing that is severe and formal and I have been told that  method and attention  are very necessary to obtain the proper fruit of study and application now as to the method we are utter strangers to it and we have never been accustomed to bestow the least attention upon any thing but the adorning and exhibiting our dear personsnot that we are so averse to letters as totally to neglect every species of composition but we manage that affair in so compendious and pleasing a manner that it becomes a mere amusement Messagecards afford us a great deal of employment nor are there wanting very elegant models of that pretty stile of writing  There is a judicious gentleman in this town who advertises to teach all sorts of penmanship in a very few hours the Italian hand in nineteen hours and in proportion all the rest I am credibly informed that in imitation of so worthy an original there is a lady very shortly expected here from Brussels who will undertake to teach French in a fortnight history in sixteen hours morality in half an hour and religion in a quarter of an hour  I have heard it said by a gentleman that he knew only two books of any use a bible and almanac  for my part I think a spelling dictionary and Grey's Love Letters very ample furniture for a lady's library  You can say no doubt many plausible things in recommendation of your Platonic system such as that you do not purpose to convert ladies into philosophers and mathematicians but only to qualify them for rational conversation that you can't apprehend any danger that ladies may be more remiss in the proper discharge of all duties merely because they understand better the obligations they lie under to the performance of them that ignorance of such matters as are necessary to be known is not only highly contemptible but even criminalall this and a great deal more you may urge to the same purpose but be assured your remonstrances will be infallibly drowned amidst the noise and dissipation of public life  I am madam Your very Humble Servant PARTHENISSA  THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED  THE loss of Sir Charles having clouded all Sophia's views of happiness she earnestly intreated Mr Herbert's permission to settle herself in that humble station to which providence seemed to call her and as she believed Mrs Gibbons might be very useful to her upon this occasion she resolved to apply to her as soon as she had his answer  Notwithstanding all her endeavours to bear this shock of fate with patience a fixed melancholy took possession of her mind convinced that Sir Charles had loved her and that by an unfortunate concurrence of circumstances he had been prevented from giving her the utmost proof of his affection her tenderness no longer combatted by suspicions to his prejudice gained new force every day and all his actions now appeared to her in a favourable point of view so true it is that when a person is found less guilty than he is suspected he is concluded more innocent than he really is  Mr Herbert after a long silence at length acquainted her that he was ill and desired her not to leave Mr Lawson's till she heard further from him  The shortness of this billet the trembling hand with which it appeared to be written filled Sophia with the most dreadful apprehensions Sir Charles was now forgot and all her thoughts were taken up with the danger of her worthy friend she determined to go to him and although Mr Lawson and his wife endeavoured to dissuade her from taking such a journey and William urged by Dolly and his own eagerness to serve her offered to go and bring her an exact account of the state of his health yet her purpose remained unalterable  My dear benefactor is ill said she and has none but strangers about him it is fit that I should go and attend him and if I must lose him pursued she bursting into tears it will be some comfort to me to reflect that I have done my duty  She set out early the next morning in the stagecoach Dolly wept at parting and engaged her lover to attend Sophia to her journey's end that if Mr Herbert should be worse than they apprehended he might be near to assist and comfort her  Sophia when she saw him riding by the side of the coach attempted to persuade him to return but William charmed to have an opportunity of expressing his zeal for her service would not quit her and her spirits being too weak to contest this point with him she was obliged to suffer his attendance  They reached the place where Mr Herbert was in the evening of the third day he had taken  lodgings at the house of a farmer where he was attended with great tenderness and care  Sophia appeared with so deep a concern upon her countenance and enquired for him with such extreme emotion that the good woman of the house concluding she was his daughter thought it necessary before she answered her questions to preach patience and submission to her wisely observing that we are all mortal and that death spares nobody from the squire to the plowman  She ran on in this manner till she perceived Sophia grow as pale as death and close her eyes she had just time to prevent her from falling and with William's assistance placed her in a chair where while she applied remedies to recover her from her swoon the youth with tears in his eyes asked her softly how long Mr Herbert had been dead  Dead repeated the farmer's wife who told you he was dead no no it is not so bad as that neither  William rejoiced to hear this and as soon as Sophia shewed some signs of returning life he greeted her with the welcome news She cast a look full of doubt and anguish upon the countrywoman who confirmed his report and offered to go with her to the gentleman's room Sophia instantly found her strength return she followed her with trembling haste and left her presence should surprise Mr Herbert she directed the good woman to tell him that a friend of his was come to see him  She heard him answer in a weak voice but with some emotion "It is my dear child bring her to me"  Sophia immediately appeared and throwing herself upon her knees at his bedside burst into tears and was unable to speak  The good old man holding one of her hands prest in his tenderly blamed her for the trouble she had given herself in coming so far to visit him but acknowledged at the same time that this instance of her affection was extremely dear to him and that her presence gave him inexpressible comfort  Sophia entered immediately upon the office of a nurse to her benefactor and performed all the duties of the most affectionate child to the best of parents  Mr Herbert employed the little remaining strength he had in endeavours to comfort her and in pious exhortations  Weep not for me my dear child would he say but rather rejoice that the innocence of my life has diverted death of his terrors and enabled me to meet him with calm resignation and with humble hope At this awful hour how little would it avail me that I had been rich that I had been great and powerful but what comforts do I not feel from an unreproving conscience these comforts every one has it in his power to procure live virtuous then my dear Sophia that you may die in peace how small is the difference between the longest and the shortest life if its pleasures be few its miseries are so likewise how little do they enjoy whom the world calls happy how little  do they suffer whom it pronounces wretched one point of fleeting time past and death reduces all to an equality But the distinction between virtue and vice and its future happiness and misery are eternal  Sophia had need of all the consolation she derived from her reflections on the virtue and piety of her friend to enable her to bear the apprehensions of his approaching death with any degree of fortitude but when she least expected it his distemper took a favourable turn and in a few days the most dangerous symptoms were removed  The Bath waters being judged absolutely necessary for the entire reestablishment of his health he resolved to go thither as soon as he had recovered strength enough to bear the journey  Sophia at his earnest desire consented to return to Mr Lawson's and remain there till he came from Bath but she would not quit him till he was able to take this journey and by the sweetness of her conversation her tender assiduity and watchful care contributed so much towards his recovery that he was soon in a condition to travel with safety  He accompanied her the first day's journey to Mr Lawson's and being met at the inn by this worthy friend and young William he consigned his beloved charge to their care and pursued his way to Bath  Sophia was received with great joy by Mrs Lawson and her daughters Dolly hung a long time upon her neck in transports and as soon as they were alone informed her that Mrs Gibbons and her mother were perfectly reconciled that she had  consented to her nephew's marriage and even shewed an impatience to conclude it but I prevailed said she to have the ceremony delayed till you my dear friend could be present for I could not think of being happy while you to whom I owe all was afflicted  Sophia embraced her tenderly congratulated her upon her change of fortune and gave many praises to her lover to whom she acknowledged great obligations for his care and attention to her  Dolly's cheeks glowed with pleasure while she heard her William commended by one whom she so much loved and revered  The young lovers were married a few days afterwards and Sophia who had so earnestly endeavoured to bring about this union and had suffered so much in her own interest by her solicitude concerning it was one of those to whom it gave the most satisfaction  Mean time Mr Herbert continued indisposed at Bath and Sophia uneasy left in this increase of his expences her residence at Mr Lawson's should lay him under some difficulties resolved to ease him as soon as possible of the charge of her maintenance she explained her situation to Mrs Gibbons and requested her assistance in procuring her a place  Mrs Gibbons expressed great tenderness and concern for her upon this occasion and assured her she would employ all her interest in her service She accordingly mentioned her with great praise to a widow lady of a very affluent fortune who had established such a character for generosity and  goodness that she hoped if she could be induced to take Sophia under her protection her fortune would be made  Mrs Howard so was the lady called no sooner heard that a young woman of merit well born and genteely educated was reduced to go to service for subsistence than she exclaimed with great vehemence against the avarice and luxury of the rich and great who either hoarded for their unthankful heirs or lavished in expensive pleasures those superfluous sums which ought to be applied to the relief of the indigent  Oh that I had a fortune cried she as large as my heart there should not be one distressed person in the world I must see this young lady Mrs Gibbons and I must do something for her You have obliged me infinitely by putting it in my power to gratify the unbounded benevolence of my heart upon a deserving object  Mrs Gibbons when she related this conversation to Sophia filled her with an extreme impatience to see the lady not from any mean considerations of advantage to herself but admiration of so excellent a character She accompanied Mrs Gibbons in a visit to her at her countryseat which was but a few miles distant from the village where they lived and Mrs Howard was so pleased with her at this first interview that she gave her an invitation to spend the remainder of the summer with her and this in so obliging a manner that Sophia immediately complied not thinking it necessary to wait till she had consulted Mr Herbert upon this offer as she was fully persuaded he could  have no objections to her accepting it Mrs Howard being so considerable by her family and fortune and so estimable by her character  This lady who had made an early discovery of Sophia's economical talents set her to work immediately after her arrival her task was to embroider a white sattin negligee which she undertook with great readiness pleased at having an opportunity of obliging a woman of so generous a disposition and in some degree to requite her for her hospitality  Mrs Howard indeed always prevented those on whom she conferred favours from incurring the guilt of ingratitude for she took care to be fully repaid for any act of benevolence and having a wonderful art in extracting advantage to herself from the necessities of others she sometimes sought out the unfortunate with a solicitude that did great honour to her charity which was sure to be its own reward A few ostentatious benefactions had sufficiently established her character and while her name appeared among the subscribers to some fashionable charity who could suspect that her table was served with a parsimony which would have disgraced a much smaller fortune that her rents from her indigent tenants were exacted with the most unrelenting rigor and the naked and hungry sent sighing from her gate  Nothing is more certain than what is called liberality is often no more than the vanity of giving of which some persons are fonder than of what they give But the vanity of giving publicly is most prevailing and hence it happens that those who are most celebrated  for their charity are in reality least sensible to the feelings of humanity and the same persons from whom the most affecting representation of private distress could not force the least relief have been among the first to send their contributions to any new foundation  Sophia knew not how to reconcile many circumstances in Mrs Howard's conduct with her general professions of benevolence and generosity but that lady had been so used to disguise herself to others that at last she did not know herself and the warmth and vehemence with which she delivered her sentiments imposed almost as much upon herself as her hearers  Sophia's amiable qualities however soon produced their usual effects and inspired Mrs Howard with as much friendship for her as so interested a temper was capable of She wished to see her fortune established and was very desirous of serving her as far as she could consistent with her prudent maxims which were to make other persons the source of those benefits the merit of which she arrogated to herself  Chance soon furnished her with an opportunity of exerting her talents in favour of Sophia and of engaging as she conceived her eternal gratitude A country lady of her acquaintance coming one day to visit her with her son a clownish ignorant youth Mrs Howard was encouraged by the frequent glances he gave Sophia to form a scheme for marrying her to him and in this she foresaw so many possible advantages to  herself from Sophia's grateful disposition that she pursued it with the most anxious solicitude  Mr Barton so was the young squire called having conceived a liking for Sophia repeated his visits frequently emboldened by Mrs Howard's civilities who took every occasion of praising Sophia and insinuating that he would be extremely happy in such a wife  She sometimes left him alone with Sophia in hopes that he would declare his passion to her but the rustic awed by the dignity of her person and manners durst not even raise his eyes to look on her so that Mrs Howard finding the affair did not advance so fast as she wished rallied Sophia upon her illtimed reserve and hinted her views in her favour which she considering as an effect of her friendship listened to with respect and even gratitude though her heart refused to concur in them  This conversation passed in the presence of Mrs Howard's only son a youth about nineteen who had come from the university to pass a few days with his mother As soon as she had quitted Sophia he approached her and with a look of tenderness and concern told her  He was sorry to find his mother so zealous an advocate for Mr Barton who could not possibly deserve her  Nor can I possibly deserve him replied Sophia with a smile he is too rich  Love only and merit can deserve you resumed the young student sighing and if love was merit I know one who mighthope  He paused and hesitated and Sophia to whom the language of love in any mouth but Sir Charles's  was odious suddenly quitted him to avoid the continuance of a discourse which she considered as mere unmeaning gallantry  Mean time her rustic lover not having courage enough to declare his passion to her had recourse to the indulgence of his mother who till that time had never refused any of his desires  He told her that he never liked any young woman so well in his life as Mrs Sophia Darnley and that he was sure she would make a good wife because Mrs Howard had told him so and encouraged him to break his mind to her but he was ashamed he declared he would marry no body else and begged his mother to get her for him  Mrs Barton full of rage against her neighbour for thus endeavouring to ensnare her son into a marriage as she conceived unworthy of him resolved to go to her and load her with reproaches While her chariot was getting ready she continued to question her son and heard a great many particulars from him which convinced her that his affections were more deeply engaged than she had imagined  After ordering the young squire to be locked up till her return she flew to Mrs Howard and with the most violent transports of rage upbraided her with the treacherous part she had acted by seducing her son into a liking for a poor creature who was a dependent upon her charity and whom she took this method to get rid of  Mrs Howard who held Mrs Barton in great contempt on account of her ignorance and valued herself extremely upon her philosophic command  over her passions listened with an affected calmness to all Mrs Barton's invectives and when she found she had railed herself out of breath she began to declaim in a solemn accent against avarice and that vile and fordid disposition of parents who in the marriage of their children preferred the dross of riches to the real treasures of wisdom and virtue She very charitably lamented Mrs Barton's want of discernment and littleness of mind and concluded that Miss Sophia's merit rendered her deserving of a husband even more considerable than Mr Barton  Then marry her to your own son replied Mrs Barton with a sneer no doubt but he will be more worthy of her  If my son should declare a passion for Miss Sophia resumed Mrs Howard it would soon be seen how far my sentiments are exalted above yours  I am glad to hear this returned Mrs Barton for I am very sure Mr Howard is in love with this wonderful creature whom you praise so much and since you are so willing to make her your daughterinlaw I shall be under no fear of my son's marrying her  Mrs Howard at this unexpected stroke turned as pale as death and with a faultering voice asked her  What reason she had for supposing her son was in love with Miss Sophia  Mrs Barton who enjoyed her perplexity and confusion suffered her to repeat her questions several times and then maliciously referred her to the young gentleman himself  Who said she upon  finding you so favourably disposed will I doubt not be ready enough to own his inclinations  Mrs Howard was now so far humbled that she condescended to intreat Mrs Barton to tell her what she knew of this affair  All my information said Mrs Barton comes from my son to whom Mr Howard considering him as his rival declared his better right to the lady as having acquainted her with his passion  At this intelligence Mrs Howards rage got so much the better of her prudence that she uttered a thousand invectives against the innocent Sophia which drew some severe sarcasms from Mrs Barton who being now fully revenged rose up to be gone but Mrs Howard sensible that a quarrel upon this occasion might have consequences very unfavourable to her reputation seized her hand and led her half reluctant again to her chair where after she had soothed her into good humour by some flattering expressions which coming from one of her acknowledged understanding had great weight She told her with the most unblushing confidence that she was now convinced she had been deceived in the character of the young woman on whom she had with her usual generosity conferred so many benefits  I find to my inexpressible concern pursued she that this modest sensible and virtuous young creature as I once believed her is in reality an artful hypocrite whose only aim is to make her fortune by ensnaring some unexperienced youth into a marriage Let us join our endeavours then my dear Mrs Barton to preserve our sons from this danger this is a  common cause all mothers are concerned in it we will shew the young dissembler in her true colours and prevent her imposing upon others as she has done on us  Mrs Barton who never carried her reflections very far was so well pleased with Mrs Howard's present behaviour that she forgot all the past these two ladies became on a sudden the best friends in the world and this union was to be cemented with the ruin of Sophia's fame such beginnings have certain female friendships and such are the leagues in which the wicked join  Mrs Barton proposed to have her sent for into their presence and after reproaching her severely dismiss her with contempt but the more politic Mrs Howard whose views were at once to destroy Sophia's reputation and to secure her own disapproved of this harsh treatment as she called it and charitably resolved to ruin her with all possible gentleness  She wrote to Mrs Gibbons and acquainted her that having discovered an intrigue carrying on between Sophia and her son she thought it necessary to dismiss her immediately out of her family but that the poor young creature might be exposed as little as possible to censure she begged she would come herself to fetch her away and deliver her to her friends with a caution to watch her conduct carefully  She recommended secrecy to her for Sophia's sake and assured her that if it had not been for this discovery of her bad conduct she had resolved to have provided for her handsomely  Mrs Gibbons whom this letter threw into the utmost astonishment immediately communicated the contents of it to Dolly and William with whom she now lived  Dolly burst into tears of grief and indignation and earnestly intreated her to go immediately and take Miss Sophia out of a house where her merit was so little understood but William who looked farther into the consequences of this affair than either his wife or his aunt believed it necessary for the justification of Sophia's honour that Mr Lawson should wait upon Mrs Howard and demand an explanation of those censures which she had cast upon a young lady confided to his care rightly judging that if malice was the source of her accusation she would not dare to pursue it with a man of his character and if it arose from the information of others he would be able to detect the falshood of it  These reasons prevailed with Mrs Gibbons who had been very desirous to shew her eloquence upon this occasion and was resolved she said not to have spared Mrs Howard for her  immature  conclusions  William went immediately to his fatherinlaw and acquainted him with what had happened Mr Lawson was grieved from the consideration of what Sophia's delicate sensibility would feel from such an attack upon her reputation and this was the worst that he apprehended could happen from calumnies which the purity of her manners and the innocency of her life would be always a sufficient refutation of A wise and virtuous person he  knew was out of the reach of fortune though not free from the malice of it All attempts against such a one are as the poet says like the arrows of Xerxes they may darken the day but cannot stifle the sun  His impatience to take Sophia out of the hands of a woman whom he conceived to be either very malicious or very imprudent made him defer his visit no longer than till the afternoon  When he sent in his name Mrs Howard who had no suspicion of the occasion of his coming ordered him to be shewn into a parlour where she suffered him to wait near an hour before she admitted him to her presence a country curate being in her opinion a person too insignificant to lay claim to any degree of consideration and besides this sort of neglect being affected by many persons of quality to whom it certainly gives great importance and dignity their imitators never lose any opportunity of exercising it  Mr Lawson was at last summoned to the lady's dressingroom where he expected to have found Sophia but was glad to see Mrs Howard alone She asked him with a little superciliousness if he had any business with her to which he replied with a solemnity in his look and accent that surprised her  That being a friend to miss Sophia Darnley and the person to whose care she was confided by her relations he thought it his duty to enquire what part of her conduct had given occasion for those unfavourable suspicions which were entertained of her  Mrs Gibbons madam pursued he has communicated to me a letter which she has received from you wherein there is a heavy charge against miss Sophia a charge which none who know her can think it possible for her to deserve There must certainly be some mistake here madam you have been misinformed or appearances have deceived you and in justice to you as well as to one of the most virtuous and amiable young women in the world I am resolved to trace the source of these calumnies that her innocence may be fully cleared I beg of you then madam let me know what foundation you have for believing that Miss Sophia  Mrs Howard whom this speech had thrown into great confusion interrupted him here to prevent his repeating those expressions in her letter the meaning of which though obvious she durst not avow  I find said she that you and Mrs Gibbons have seen this affair in a worse light than I intended you should my son has been foolish enough to entertain a liking for this girl whom I took under my protection with a view to provide for her handsomely and she has been wise enough pursued she with an ironical smile to give him encouragement I suppose but with all her excellencies I am not disposed to make her my daughterinlaw  Mrs Howard threw in this last softening expression in hopes it would satisfy Mr Lawson and added that to prevent any thing happening which might  be disagreeable to her she begged he would take Sophia home with him  Most willingly madam said he but since it seems to be your opinion that this young gentlewoman has encouraged the clandestine addresses of your son I think it will be proper to examine first into the truth of these suspicions that you may not part with worse thoughts of her than she deserves  Mrs Howard being thus prest and unwilling to enter into an explanation that would expose all her artifices was forced to acknowledge that she had no other foundation for her fears than the passion her son had owned for her and having made this unwilling concession she left him with a countenance inflamed with stifled rage saying she would send Sophia to him  Accordingly she went into the room where she was at work and told her her friend the curate was waiting to carry her home Observing her to look extremely surprised  If you consider said she what returns you have made me for the benefits I have conferred upon you you will not think it strange that we should part in this manner  Bless me cried Sophia what have I done to deserve such reproaches  I cannot stay to talk to you now said Mrs Howard I have explained myself to Mr Lawson I am sorry to say that I now can only wish you well  She hurried out of the room when she had said this and Sophia in the utmost perplexity and concern  flew down stairs to Mr Lawson who was already at the gate waiting to help her into the chaise she gave him her hand asking him at the same time with great emotion  What Mrs Howard accused her of  As soon as they drove away Mr Lawson related all that had past between that lady and him which filled Sophia with new astonishment she could not comprehend Mrs Howard's motives for acting in the manner she had done with regard to her all her conduct appeared to her highly extravagant and inconsistent she asked Mr Lawson a thousand questions full of that simplicity which ever accompanies real goodness of heart  He gave her some notion of the dangerous character of Mrs Howard and greatly blamed her for having so suddenly accepted her invitation without first consulting Mr Herbert  It is a maxim pursued he of one of the wisest of the antients that in forming new connections of every sort it is of great importance in what manner the first approaches are made and by whose hands the avenues of friendship are laid open  Mr Lawson by this hint gave Sophia to understand that he did not think Mrs Gibbons a proper person to introduce her into the world She was now sensible that she had been too precipitate but her motives were so generous that Mr Herbert whom in a letter she acquainted with the whole affair easily justified her in his own opinion though he earnestly recommended it to her not to let her apprehensions of being burthensome to him draw her into new inconveniencies  Mr Lawson having as he imagined prevented Mrs Howard from making any future attack upon Sophia's reputation by obliging her to acknowledge her innocence was surprised to hear whereever he went of the calumnies she invented against her  Nothing is more common than for persons to hate with extreme inveteracy those whom they have injured and although Mrs Howard was convinced that Sophia would not admit a visit from her son who now openly avowed his passion for her that she refused to receive his letters and shunned every place where she thought it possible to meet him yet pretending to be apprehensive that the youth would be drawn into a clandestine marriage she sent him away precipitately upon his travels and this gave a colour to new invectives against Sophia who trusting only to her innocence for her justification had the satisfaction to find that innocence fully acknowledged in the esteem and respect with which she was treated by all the persons of fashion in the neighbourhood  Mr Herbert who in every new trial to which she was exposed found greater cause for admiration of her character praised the gentleness and forgiving spirit which she discovered upon this occasion but Mrs Gibbons was not wholly satisfied with her conduct  You ought to  discriminate  upon Mrs Howard said she and tell the world how desirous she was to have you married to her friend's son though she makes such a clutter about her own indeed you want spirit miss  Sophia  added the old lady with a little contempt  I am not of your opinion madam replied Sophia for in taking revenge upon our enemies we are only even with them in passing over their malice we are superior  Well well interrupted Mrs Gibbons I have no notion of such  superiousness  I always resent injuries and Mrs Howard shall feel my resentment for her malice to you I have not returned her last visit yet and perhaps I may not this month this is pretty severe I think  Sophia composing her countenance as well as she could thanked Mrs Gibbons for this instance of her friendship to her but she had no opportunity to observe whether she kept her word for she was summoned to town by a letter from her mother which gave her a melancholy account of her affairs  Mrs Darnley acquainted her that the gentleman was dead who paid her the annuity which Sir Charles had stipulated for her when he procured him her late husband's place She desired her to come immediately to town to assist her under her misfortunes and added in a postscript as if reluctantly that Harriot had left her and was not so dutiful as she could wish  Sophia read this letter with tears and impatient to comfort her afflicted mother she instantly prepared for her little journey  All Mr Lawson's family parted from her with great regret but Dolly's affliction was extreme and Sophia amidst so many greater causes of sorrow  felt a new pang when she took leave of her tender and innocent friend  To spare Mr Lawson the trouble of conducting her to town she accepted a place in the coach of a lady with whom she had lately become acquainted and who professed a particular esteem for her  On her arrival at her mother's house she found only a servant there who informed her that her mistress had taken lodgings at Kensington for the air having been indisposed for some weeks past  Sophia ordered her to get a hackney coach to the door and was hurrying away without daring to enquire for her sister when the maid told her Miss Darnley desired to see her before she went to Kensington  "Where is my sister" said Sophia with a faultering accent  The answer she received was a stroke of fortune more cruel than any she had yet experienced her sister she found lived in the house which Sir Charles had once offered to her  Trembling and pale she ordered the coachman to drive thither and drawing up the windows relieved her labouring heart with a shower

anguish of my soul express  When to my rival you resign'd your charms  And fill'd his richer but less faithful arms  These threescore years and ten thy loss I've mourn'd  While Tirzah's hills my loud complaint return'd  Those hills which gilded by the sun's bright ray  Ill suited my sad soul that loath'd the day  Thick groves I rais'd and hid my sorrows there  And left the rest to bounteous

wealth but love  THE HISTORY OF THE COUNT DE COMMINGE CONCLUDED  I HAVE some important business said he which demands my presence in Saragossa my health will not permit me to take this journey I must intreat you therefore to go in my stead I have ordered my equipage to be got ready and you will oblige me by setting out immediately  The Marquis de Benavides is older than me by a great number of years I have always had the same respect for him as for a father and he has held the place of one to me Besides I had no reason to urge which could dispense with my doing as he desired I was obliged therefore to resolve to go but I thought this ready compliance gave me a right to speak to him in favour of Madame de Benavides What did I not say to soften him he appeared to me to be shaken I even fancied I saw tears in his eyes  I have loved Madame de Benavides said he to me with the most ardent passion it is not yet extinguished in my heart but time and her future  conduct can only efface the remembrance of what I have seen  I durst not enter into any discourse with him concerning the cause of his complaints that would have again recalled his former rage I only desired permission to acquaint my sisterinlaw with the hopes he had given me He granted my request This poor lady received the news I brought her with a kind of joy  I know said she that I can never be happy with Monsieur de Benavides but I shall at least have the consolation of being where my duty calls me  After having again assured her of my brother's good disposition to her I took my leave of her One of the chief domestics of the house in whom I confided had promised to be strictly attentive to every thing that regarded her and to give me information  After these precautions which I thought necessary I set out for Saragossa I had been there fifteen days without having any news from the castle and was beginning to be very uneasy at this long silence when I received a letter from the faithful domestic I mentioned He informed me that three days after my departure Monsieur de Benavides had discharged him and all the rest of his servants except one man whom he named to me and the wife of that man I trembled as I read this letter and without troubling myself any further about the business with which I was charged I hired posthorses to return to the castle When I was within a day's journey of this place  received the fatal news of the death of Madame de Benavides My brother who wrote to me himself appeared so greatly affected that I could not suppose he had been accessary to it He told me the great love he had for his wife had subdued his resentment and that he was ready to pardon her when death matched her from him that she had relapsed a short time after my departure and her fever encreasing she died upon the fifteenth day of her illness Since I came hither to seek some consolation in the company of Don Jerome I have been informed my brother is plunged in the deepest sadness that he sees no one and he has even entreated me to defer seeing him for some time  I find no difficulty in complying with his request continued Don Gabriel those places in which I have seen the unfortunate Madame de Benavides and where I shall no more see her would increase my grief Her death seems to have awakened all my former sentiments and I know not whether the tears I shed do not more proceed from love than friendship I have determined to go into Hungary where I hope either to find death in the war or to recover the peace I have lost  Here Don Gabriel ceased to speak I was not able to answer him but with tears my voice was lost in sighs Don Gabriel also wept bitterly at length he left me without my being able to utter a single word Don Jerome attended him out and I was left alone The melancholy relation I had just heard increased my impatience to see myself  in a place where I might abandon myself without interruption to the excess of my grief  The desire of executing this scheme hastened my cure after having been long in a languishing condition my wound was healed my strength returned and I found myself able in a little time to leave the convent  The parting between Don Jerome and me was on his side full of tenderness and friendly concern but the loss of Adelaida had left me insensible to all other impressions I would not acquaint him with my design lest he should endeavour to oppose it I wrote to my mother and sent my letter by Saint Laurent making him believe that I would wait for an answer in the place I then was  This letter contained an account of all that had happened to me since I saw her last I earnestly asked her pardon for leaving her as I resolved to do for ever I added that in tenderness to her maternal affection I chose to spare her the sight of a miserable wretch who had now nothing left to wish for but death and lastly I conjured her not to make any attempts to discover the place of my retreat and recommended the faithful Saint Laurent to her protection  When I parted with him I gave him all the money I had about me reserving only what was sufficient to defray my expences during my journey The letter I had received from Madame de Benavides and her picture which I wore next my heart was all the wealth I was possessed of I travelled with an impatience which hardly allowed me to stop a moment to the abbey de la F  Upon my arrival I demanded the habit of the order The father abbot obliged me to undergo the probationary forms and when they were finished asked me whether the wretched diet and other austerities did not appear more than equal to my strength Absorbed in grief I had not even perceived the difference of my diet and the austerities he mentioned my insensibility was taken for a mark of zeal and I was received  The certainty I now had that my tears might flow uninterrupted and that I might pass my whole life in this sad employment gave me some consolation the horrid solitude the melancholy silence that reigned in this cloister the mortified countenances of all about me left me wholly devoted to that grief which was become so precious to me that it supplied the place of all I had lost I performed all the exercises of the cloister without thinking of their severity for every thing was alike indifferent to me I went every day into the thickest part of the wood there would I read over the letter and gaze on the picture of my Adelaida bathe them both with my tears and replacing them upon my heart return with greater weight of grief  Three years I led this melancholy life while time neither alleviated my sorrow nor brought the period to it which I so earnestly desired when one morning I was summoned by the tolling of the bell to be present at the death of one of the religious He was already laid upon the ashes the last sacrament was going to be administred to him when he desired to speak to the father abbot  What I am going to say father said the dying penitent will animate with new fervour all who shall hear me since by methods so extraordinary I have been drawn out of the abyss of sin and misery into which I was plunged and conducted into the port of salvation I am unworthy of the name of brother with which these holy religious have honoured me in me you behold an unhappy woman whom a profane passion has led to this sanctified place I loved and was beloved by a young man of a rank equal to my own the mutual hatred of our fathers was an insurmountable obstacle to our marriage I was even obliged for the safety of my lover to give my hand to another person and in the choice of my husband I endeavoured still to give him proofs of the continuance of my passion The man who could not be supposed to inspire me with any sentiments but those of hatred or contempt was preferred to every other who addressed me because the sacrifice I made him should be compleat and that he might have no cause for jealousy The Almighty decreed that a marriage contracted with such criminal views should prove a source of misery to me Although I would never after consent to see my lover yet my husband and he met and wounded each other before my eyes Terror and grief threw me into a violent illness I was scarcely recovered when my husband shut me up in a private apartment of his castle and caused it to be reported that I was dead  I continued two years in that melancholy confinement with no other consolation than  what the compassion of her who daily brought me my food afforded me My husband not satisfied with the miseries he inflicted on me had the cruelty to insult me under them Oh my God what do I say dare I accuse of cruelty the instrument thou wast pleased to make use of for my punishment these afflictions did not bring me to a just sense of the extravagances of my conduct instead of weeping for my faults I wept only for my lover  The death of my husband set me at liberty The woman who served me being the only person who knew the truth of my condition came to open the doors of my prison and informed me that I had passed for dead from the moment I entered it Not doubting but the treatment I had met with from my husband had given rise to very unfavourable suspicions of my virtue I deliberated whether it was not necessary I should pass the rest of my days in a convent and I was confirmed in this design when I learned that the only person who could retain me in the world had not been heard of for a long time I disguised myself in the habit of a man that I might leave the castle without being known  The convent to which I resolved to retire was that in which I was educated and is but a few leagues distant from hence I was travelling to it when the solitariness of this place striking my imagination as I passed by I alighted from my chaise in order to indulge my sad reflections a few moments a secret impulse which I could not resist led me into your chapel Scarce had I entered  when among the voices that sung the praises of our Lord I distinguished one too well accustomed to reach my heart I thought at first that my disordered imagination had deceived me by a fancied resemblance but when I approached notwithstanding the alteration which time grief and the austerities of a cloister had made in his countenance I immediately knew that lover so dear to my remembrance  Great God what became of me at this sight what were the cruel agitations of my mind far from praising the Almighty for calling him to so holy a profession I blasphemed against him for having deprived me of him you punished not my impious murmurs oh my God and you made use of my own folly and misery to draw me to your self  I was not able to leave a place which inclosed what I loved and that we might no more be separated I discharged my guide and presented myself father to you Deceived by the eagerness I discovered to be admitted into your cloister you received me willingly Alas what were the dispositions I brought to your holy exercises a heart filled with a profane passion and every thought employed on the dear object of its tenderness  The Almighty who by abandoning me to my wild affections would give me greater cause for humbling myself one day before him doubtless permitted those impoisoned delights which I tasted in breathing the same air and living in the same house with him I loved I followed  him every where I assisted him in his labours as much as my strength would allow and in those moments I thought myself overpaid for all that I had suffered but yet my imprudent tenderness did not carry me so far as to make myself known to him But what was the motive that hindered me the fear of disturbing the quiet of him for whom I had lost my own but for this fear I should perhaps have attempted to snatch from God a soul which I believed wholly devoted to him  Two months are now elapsed since in obedience to a regulation of our holy founder who was desirous by a continual idea of death to sanctify the lives of his religious we have been obliged each to dig his own grave I followed as usual him to whom I was attached by ties so shameful The sight of his grave the ardour with which he dug it pierced my heart with such an excess of sorrow that I was obliged to leave him and retire to the most unfrequented part of the wood to give free course to my tears From that moment I was in continual apprehensions of losing him the idea of his death was ever present to my mind my tenderness increased I followed him every where and if I was some hours of the day without seeing him I feared I should never see him more  But now the happy moment arrived when God was pleased to draw me to himself I went with the man my soul so fondly loved into the forest to get wood for the use of the house after some time spent in this employment I perceived that  my companion had left me anxious and uneasy at his absence I could not help going to seek for him After having wandered through great part of the forest I saw him at length in one of the most retired parts of it employed in gazing earnestly upon something he had taken from his bosom he was in so profound a revery that I came up close to him and had leisure to look upon what he held in his hand without his perceiving me How great was my astonishment when I saw it was my own picture  I was now sensible that far from enjoying that quiet I had been so unwilling to interrupt he was like me the miserable victim of a criminal passion I saw the powerful hand of God ready to fall upon him that fatal passion which I had carried with me even to the foot of his altar seemed to have drawn the vengeance of heaven upon him who was the object of it  Full of this terrifying idea I came to prostrate myself before those altars I implored of God my own conversion in order to obtain that of my lover Yes oh my God it was for him that I offered up my supplications to thee for him I shed tears of remorse and grief it was the desire of his salvation that brought me to thee Thou hadst compassion upon my weakness my prayer profane as it was thou didst not reject my heart became sensible of the healing power of thy grace from that blissful moment I experienced the peace of a soul which is with thee and desires only thee thou wast pleased to purify me by sufferings I was seized with sickness  soon after If the partner of my wild affections still groans under the weight of his profane passion let him cast his eyes upon me let him view the wretch whom he has so madly loved let him reflect upon that tremendous moment to which I am now arrived and to which he shall shortly arrive Oh let him seek God ere he has silenced his mercy to listen only to his justice But I feel the time of my last sacrifice approaching I beseech these holy religious to offer up their prayers for my departing soul I humbly intreat their pardon for the offence I have given them and I acknowledge myself unworthy to partake of their sepulchre  The sound of that adored voice now undisguised and always present to my remembrance made me know Adelaida at the first words she pronounced What language can convey an idea of what I then felt all that the most ardent love all that the tenderest companion all that the most poignant grief and wildest despair could inspire tore my distracted soul that moment I was prostrate on the ground like the other religious while she was speaking the fear of losing any one of her words restrained my cries but when I found that in uttering the last she had expired the house ecchoed with my agonizing shrieks  The religious running to me raised me from the ground I tore myself put of their arms flew to the corps of Adelaida and kneeling down beside it I bathed one of her lifeless hands with my tears  I have lost you then a second time my dear Adelaida cried I and I have lost you for  ever What have you been so long with me and did not my ungrateful heart acknowledge you but we will never more be separated death added I folding her in my arms death less cruel than my inexorable father shall now in spite of him unite us for ever  True piety is never severe The father abbot moved at this light endeavoured by the tenderest condolences and the most holy exhortations to soften my grief and prevail upon me to abandon the corps of Adelaida which I held fast locked in my arms finding me deaf to all he could urge he was obliged to use force they dragged me from the lovely body into my own cell whither the fatherabbot followed me he staid with me the whole night vainly attempting to calm my mind my despair was increased by the consolations he offered me  Give me Adelaida said I why have you separated us oh why did not my soul take its flight with hers Alas I can live no longer in a place where I have lost her and where she suffered so many miseries Permit me added I throwing myself at his feet permit me to leave this cloister what will you do with a miserable wretch whose despair will trouble your repose suffer me to retire to some other solitude there to wait for a final end to all my sorrows My dear Adelaida will obtain of God that my penitence and prayers may be affectual for my salvation and oh father do not refuse my last request promise me that the same tomb shall unite our ashes and I in return engage not to  hasten that moment which my soul so ardently pants after  The fatherabbot moved with compassion for my misfortunes and perhaps desirous of removing from the eyes of his religious an object which gave so much scandal to their piety granted my request and promised to do what I desired I left the convent that moment and came to this solitary wild where I have lived several years having no other consolation than that of weeping for what I have lost  TREATISE ON THE EDUCATION of DAUGHTERS CONTINUED  Indirect Instructions and that Children ought not to be urged  THE simple pleasures are less poignant less affecting it is true the others transport the soul as they stir the springs of the passions but the first are most eligible seeing they afford an equal and durable satisfaction without any evil consequences They are always benign whereas those others resemble adulterated wines that please the palate indeed more than the genuine but create a thirst and hurt the health in like manner the temperament of the soul is damaged by a pursuit after pleasures of a quick and poignant nature  All that we can do for children entrusted to our care is to use them to a plain way of life to fortify the habit of it in them for as long as we can to give them timely apprehensions of the inconveniences consequent to other sorts of pleasure and never to leave them to their own conduct as is generally done just at the time when the passions begin to make themselves be felt and when of  consequence there is the greatest necessity for restraint  It must be confessed that of all the pains of educating none is comparable to that of bringing up a child who is deficient in sensibility lively and sensible tempers are subject to terrible deviations passion and presumption hurry them away nevertheless have they great resources and frequently are seen to come back after having ran great lengths Instruction is in them a concealed bud that shoots out and some times bears fruit when experience brings its assistance to reason and the passions are grown cool at least one finds something in them by which to make them attentive and awaken their curiosity something whereby to interest them in what we would teach and to affect their sense of honour whereas we have no hold upon indolent tempers their thoughts are but the wandering of the mind they are never where they ought to be there is no touching them to the quick even by correction they hear all they feel nothing This indolence make the child negligent and disgusted with every thing he does here it is that the best scheme of education runs the risk of failing in case great diligence is not used to obviate the evil from their earliest infancy  Many people that do not fathom deep enough conclude from this ill success that it is nature which performs all in making men of merit education nothing whereas the true conclusion should be that some tempers ate like some ungrateful soils upon which cultivation has but small effect and the matter is made worse when these edecations so difficult  to accomplish are obstructed or neglected or badly regulated in the first outset  Further than this we ought to observe that there are some sorts of tempers which we are apt greatly to mistake they appear at first pretty and promising because the early graces of infancy throw a lustre over all there is an inexpressible something of the tender and amiable that keeps us off from a close examination of the composition of features every instance of wit in them surprises because not expected at that age all the faultiness of judgment is excused and carries the grace of ingenuousness we mistake a certain corporeal vivacity which never fails to appear in children for mental Hence it is that infancy seems to promise so much and yields so little One has been remarkable for his wit at five years old and in proportion as he grew up fallen into obscurity or contempt  Of all the qualities of children there is but one to be depended on that is a good reasoning faculty this grows up with them provided it be cultivated the graces of infancy will fade the vivacity decay nay the tenderness of heart often be lost forasmuch as the passions and converse with a designing world insensibly harden young people as they come forward on the stage of life  Try then to discover beyond these graces of infancy whether the disposition which you have to direct be void of curiosity or too little sensible to generous emulation Should this be the case it is scarce possible but that every person engaged in his education will quickly be discouraged at so fruitless so knotty a task wherefore we should endeavour  immediately to put in motion every spring of the soul of that child in order to rouze him from his lethargy Whenever you perceive this difficulty do not attempt a series of instruction take great care not to load his memory this is what would amaze and oppress the brain fatigue him not with rules and restrictions spirit him up far he is fallen into the contrary extreme to presumption fear not to demonstrate to him with discretion what he is capable of doing be pleased with a little make him observe even his smallest success represent to him how needlesly he was afraid of miscarrying in things that he performs well set emulation to work jealousy is more prevalent in children than one would imagine one may see some of them growing lean and pining with a secret anguish because others are more loved or more caressed than themselves It is a cruelty too commonly found among mothers to make them suffer this torment nevertheless on pressing occasions we ought to be skilled in the use of this antidote to indolence Shew the child other children that hardly do better than he for examples disproportioned to his weakness would discourage him utterly from time to time give him little victories over his rivals bring him if possible to laugh freely with you at his own timidity point out some as fearful as himself that have got the better of their disposition inform him but indirectly as it were speaking of others that want of courage and idleness sti  le the soul that the listless and the inattentive whatever genius they may have destroy their own faculties and degrade themselves  But beware of speaking with an austere and impatient tone of voice for nothing so confounds a dull and fainthearted child as harshness on the contrary bend all your care to season with ease and pleasure proportionable to his temper every task you desire he should perform and perhaps upon proper occasions it would not be amiss to irritate him by some degree of contempt and some reproaches but not by yourself in person let another do it an inferior or another child without your seeming to know what passes  St Austin relates that one single reproach of a servant wench cast upon his mother Monica when a girl so shocked her as immediately to make her leave off drinking wine unmixed a bad habit which not all the violence and severity of her governess had been able to keep her from in short we must endeavour to raise up a taste in the minds of these kind of children in like manner as is practised with regard to the palates of some sick people these are permitted to try every thing to cure their want of relish their fancies are complied with even at the expence of propriety of physical rule provided they do not run to a dangerous excess It is much more difficult to inspire with a taste those who are without one than to regulate it in others where it is not such as it ought to be  There is another sort of sensibility which to excite is still more difficult and more important and that is friendship the moment a child is capable no time should be lost in turning his affections towards their proper objects persons who will be of service to him  By friendship he will be led to every thing that can be desired of him it is a sure attachment to draw him to his good provided we know how to make use of it all that is to be feared is either too excessive or illplaced affections  But there are other children that are born politic close unconcerned but drawing every thing secretly to their own ends they deceive their parents whose tenderness makes them credulous they pretend to love them they study their inclinations in order to conform to them they seem more docile than other children of their age who act without disguise as it were upon honour their suppleness while it conceals a stubborn selfwill has the appearance of true and innate gentleness and their real temper long dissembled does not entirely display itself till the opportunity of reforming it is past and gone  If there is a temper upon which education can have no effect we may say this is it and at the same time must own that the number of such is greater than will be easily imagined Parents cannot quickly come into the belief that their child has a bad heart and what they will not see themselves no others will have the courage to try to convince them of and thus the evil augments continually the principal remedy would be to give them entire liberty from their earliest infancy of shewing their disposition before we correct we must know them thoroughly Naturally they are plain and open but constrain them never so little give them but an example of disguise they never come back to the original simplicity True  it is that God alone bestoweth a tender and good heart we can but incite by examples of generosity by maxims of honesty and disinterestedness by manifesting contempt for persons guilty of too much selflove  We must endeavour before they have parted with this first simplicity of the most natural motions of the mind to give them a taste for cordial and reciprocal friendship This purpose cannot be better promoted than by bringing such persons about them as shall never display any thing harsh false low or interested It would be right again to command them for any thing they have done out of friendship provided it be not very wrong placed or carried too far Their parents likewise should appear full of love and kindness for them for children often learn of their own parents to love nothing and besides all this I am even for cutting off in their presence all superfluous compliments to friends and all sorts of false caresses as from whence they get a custom of paying with empty shews persons they ought really to love There is a defect quite contrary to this we have been speaking of and which is often to be found in a young woman and that is to interest themselves passionately in matters merely indifferent They cannot see two persons at variance without heartily espousing one side or the other their affections and aversions run high without proper grounds in the party they happen to esteem they can see no defects in whom they happen to dislike no one good quality Now this is not to be directly opposed for contradiction makes these fancies  more obstinate but we must remark by little and little to the young person that we are better acquainted than her with every good quality of her favourite and with every bad one of the object of her dislike at the same time take care to point out as occasion serves the inconvenience of some defects in the agreeable person as well as the convenience of certain advantageous qualities to be found in the person under her displeasure Do not press the matter you will find she will come to of herself  This done lay before her consideration her strong prejudices in their most unreasonable circumstances and say gently that she will hereafter be as sensible of others which at present prevail with her when they have had their course  Relate similar mistakes of your own at her time of life but principally demonstrate as clearly as you are able the great mixture of good and evil in every object of our love or hatred thereby to abate the intenseness of her friendships and aversions  As to rewards which you shall promise children never let them consist in matters of dress or any trifling ornaments it is doing them a double mischief first giving them an esteem for what they ought to despise and secondly disabling yourself from establishing such things for rewards as would in their nature assist your endeavours Be very careful not to threaten them with obliging them to study and keeping them under certain rules let as little as possible be said about rules and when there is no avoiding such a practice let us get  into it without giving any name but only a reason drawn from convenience for doing so and so at one certain time or in one place rather than another  Were we never to praise children when they do well there would be a hazard of discouraging them therefore although praise is somewhat dangerous on account of conceit we must venture to make use of it so far as may animate without making them giddy  We see that St Paul to encourage the weak frequently intermixes commendations that his rebukes may be more readily receivedthe fathers of the church do the same It is true to render them useful it is necessary so to qualify them as to keep clear of exaggeration or flattery referring every good to God as the only source thereof  Recompense children we may by means of innocent plays that have some ingenuity in them by walking out with them by improving conversation by little presents given like so many prizes such as pictures or prints or medals or geographical cartes or books prettily bound and gilt  To be continued  ESSAY ON THE Original Inhabitants of Great Britain CONCLUDED  HAVING gone through the whole state of the heptarchy I find upon a retrospect of that government that although particular princes are mentioned and particular atchievements are recited there still seems wanting a chart of the whole that at one view may give a list and description of the monarchs their reigns and their religion Such a map is exhibited in Mr Guthrie's History of England vol I page  How much is it to be regretted that among such a number of monarchs so few acts of greatness policy jurisprudence appear how intricate and dark how teizing and immaterial are the several historical accounts from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the reign of Egbert king of the West Saxons and afterwards sole king of England The history of the Pagans during that period produces nothing but blood and slaughter The history of the christian church nothing but ridiculous miracles and fulsome enthusiasm All we perceive is that the several monarchies were continually at war with each other the motives and incitement of these wars scarce ever appear We know that  there was a general assembly consisting of the chief and greatest men in each kingdom we know that it was called the Wittenagemot and in that assembly were debated regulated and ordered the affairs of the nation Such a glimmering of light is very pleasing as it seems to shew us the rise and bulwark of our freedom a parliament This is almost the only interesting point of the heptarchy The tedious narratives of privileges revenues and immunities granted to the church the endowments of monasteries and the power of the clergy are not only unprofitable and disgusting but totally useless and despicable at least they must appear so to these times when the pope can scarce keep up his authority among the roman catholic states When his power as a prince is no longer dreaded and his power as a pope held in a very diminutive degree of veneration When on the other hand sense liberty industry and courage unite and coincide to fortify preserve and augment the present glorious and happy state of England  THE HISTORY OF THE PRINCESS PADMANI  AKEBAR the seventh emperor of the Moguls inherited the virtues and the courage of the illustrious Tamerlane all the good qualities of the Mogul princes seemed to be united in his person almost without a mixture of those vices which make us look upon them as barbarians There has scarce been known a prince of a more penetrating and extensive judgment of a more generous and intrepid soul and at the same time tender compassionate and grateful  Among the many triumphs that marked his glorious reign the reduction of Chitor was not the least considerable An Indian Raja or prince of the race of the famous Rana who had formerly submitted to the power of Tamerlane gave umbrage to Akebar who could not endure that he should hold a kind of sovereignty in his neighbourhood  This prince was called Rana after the name of his ancestors and boasted of being lineally descended from the antient Porus The territories of the Raja were not above twelve days journey from Dely Chitor the capital of his country was  rather a fortress than a town of trade it is situated on a high mountain surrounded with water on every side in the midst of a vast plain The top of the mountain on which the town is built is a flat It is about a league and a half in circumference and half a league over in some places At the foot of the mountain the Nug a pretty large river and very deep glides gently along a rivulet of the best water in the world takes its source in the town makes a great many windings within it and at last having formed several natural cascades on the break of the mountain throws itself into the river Within the compass of the fortress are several beautiful fields sowed with rice and watered by the overflowings of the rivulet It affords provisions enough to supply a tolerable large garrison A place inaccessible which wants neither victuals nor water passes in the Indies for impregnable However this was the place which Akebar undertook to conquer  This young emperor's passion for the princess Padmani the wise of Rana represented that enterprize easy to him which every one else thought impracticable Before he would attempt so dangerous a siege Akebar by his ambassadors let Rana understand that ambition alone was not the motive of this undertaking and that he might preserve his country from the ruin which threatned it by giving up the most beautiful princess of the East to the most potent monarch of the world  A proposal of this kind is not so mocking in the Indies as it would be in Europe their laws allow divorce however Rana had too much tenderness for Padmani to part with her to a rival and would  hear nothing more upon that subject but the dictates of his own valour and the tears of his wife  Can you find in your heart to abandon me says the virtuous princess to a tyrant whom I detest have we not strength enough in Chitor to consume your enemy's forces and extinguish his flame by the length of a fruitless siege at worst if I must lose my life I will lose it without regret provided I am not so unhappy as to survive you  Words so moving determined Rana to prefer an honourable war to an ignominious peace He answered the ambassador of Akebar that he would not advise his master to sit down before Chitor but if his passion had the ascendant over his reason Akebar should find in the person of Rana a true Ragepute capable of maintaining his rights and incapable of violating his faith to Padmani  The emperor was surprised at so haughty a reply he was not accustomed to meet with any opposition to his will or be crossed in his designs  Can it be possible cried he that there is a man upon earth that dares disobey me  He quickly assembled his victorious troops which had newly conquered two kingdoms  Nor was Rana less adive but made preparations for maintaining a long siege in Chitor he rouzed up by his ambassadors the slothful Rajas in his neighbourhood he gave them to understand that their negligence must soon expose them to the tyranny of a Mahometan that the Moguls were a race of people but lately arrived in the Indies  and who grew formidable only by the divisions of the Indians that if the princes votaries of Brama would unite against the sectaries of Mahomet they might easily destroy them  Jamee and Tala both Rajas and princes of two provinces bordering on Chitor joined their troops to those of Rana and came in person to make war against Akebar They appeared in the field at the head of their armies but the Mogul who advanced by long marches towards Chitor quickly dispersed them The two brothers had no other remedy but that of retiring into the strong places of their provinces and there expect the enemy whose forces they were not able to withstand in the field  Never was there seen in Indostan a finer nor a more numerous army than that of the Mogul he spared no cost to shew himself before Chitor in the utmost splendor The richness of his tents is hardly to be conceived by us in Europe all was gold about them He thought by his magnificent equipage to dazzle the Princess Padmani and by the number of his troops to frighten Rana into submission  Akebar found by experience that virtue and valour are sometimes proof against the greatest hopes or the greatest fears The gallant Indians beheld without emotion from the top of their mountain the magnificence and prodigious extent of the enemy's camp The Mogul in the beginning of the siege acted at once the soldier and the lover he shot arrows into the town which ried letters for Padmani the princess took no notice  of them he pushed the siege like one in despair He fired terribly upon the place from several batteries but his cannon shooting upwards had little or no effect  The Indians from their ramparts insulted the Mahometans and reproached them with their want of bravery though animated to the fight by more passions than one  A Portuguese historian tells us that the siege of Troy was acted over again in that of Chitor he adds that it lasted twelve years and that Padmani had time to grow old while the Mogul endeavoured to win her by his arms This is an exaggeration which the Mogul Chronocle does not confirm The siege lasted at most but two years and then concluded by a very extraordinary adventure  Akebar wearied out by so obstinate a resistance made shew of raising the siege of Chitor and wrote to Rana a very obliging artful letter He commended the Raja for his courage but desired he would grant him two favours before he quitted an enterprize which he had undertaken to his confusion first that the Raja would give him a sight of the princess whom he had not known but by public same next that he would permit him to go into Chitor and see the only place in the world capable of resisting his power  The Raja granted him the second demand very freely but refused the first He contented that the Mogul should enter Chitor attended by only fifty of his officers but would not promise that he should see Padmani  Akebar accepted the Raja's offer and having received hostages for the security of his person he entered Chitor with a smaller number of attendants than was allowed him The emperor received from Rana all the respect and all the distinction due to his rank He was regaled in the palace after the Indian manner The entertainment was civil on both sides but Akebar who possessed the most persuasive eloquence had the art to make Rana grant him more than he had promised When he saw the Indian warmed with wine he intreated him to send for Padmani for one moment The Raja was willing but they had great difficulty to get the princess to consent At last in compliance to her husband she shewed herself but disappeared in an instant This indiscretion of Rana cost him dear Akebar's passion was much more inflamed upon sight of the princess however he had command enough over himself to dissemble it he made Rana believe that he was resolved to raise the siege from a place which had already given him but too much trouble and prudently forbore to intermix in his discourse any praises of Padmani but such as were cold and indifferent  Rana thus deceived by appearances treated his most cruel enemy without the least distrust he received his presents and gave him others in return Akebar bestowed on the prince a scymetar adorned with diamonds and Rana made the emperor accept of some jewels and now the hour of their parting drew near Akebar walked towards the gate of the fortress followed only by forty of his attendants Rana to shew his respect insisted upon waiting on  him to the gate During their walk Akebar renewed his kind protestations At last they came to the gate of the fortress where the Mogul as a farther testimony of his friendship would put about the neck of Rana one of those large pearl necklaces which in India the men wear as well as the women He took care to string it with some of the strongest twist and dragged him by this collar out of the gate while his forty soldiers opposed the guard who made a motion to rescue their prince The Mogul forced the Indian to mount a horse and after having received some discharges from the musquets on the ramparts they conducted Rana alive to the emperor's camp  In the mean time the uproar made at the gate put the whole town into a consternation the people thought the enemy had surprised it and certainly had the Mogul been but a little better provided with an armed force to second his design he might easily have carried the place  Fame which ever magnifies brought to Padmani's ears the news of a sudden eruption of the enemy and that her husband was missing in the tumult The gallant princess did not suffer herself to be overwhelmed with this unexpected disaster she immediately got on horseback and with her lance in her hand appeared at the head of her troops resolved to conquer or die She did not learn the truth of Akebar's treachery and the forcing away of Rana till she came upon the very spot she perceived plainly enough that she had been the true cause of his misfortune but she thought sit to conceal that part  He is dead she cried that dearest husband is dead whom my  tenderness has undone Let us think no more of recovering him by a dishonourable composition but revenge his death by seeing the authors of it fall in heaps about us  Padmani without shedding a tear though pierced with the sharpest sorrow walked round the ramparts gave all the necessary orders encouraged the soldiers and animated the principal leaders In fine she shewed herself as much superior to the men in prudence and courage as she surpassed in beauty all those of her own sex  Akebar had now flattered himself that he should quickly become master of the fortress and gave the besieged to understand that if they did not deliver up the place and the princess he would first cause Rana's head to be struck off and conclude his revenge by sacking the town and putting the inhabitants to the sword The brave Amazon answered that her husband having fallen into the hands of a perjured man she was no longer in doubt of his death but still there remained Rageputes enough of his nation to revenge their sovereign that for her part she would employ all the authority heaven had given her over her people to raise up to the Mogul enemies yet more formidable than Rana and that the principal leaders of her army had sworn to lose their lives rather than surrender the place  Akebar was not ignorant of the firmness of the Rageputes in all their resolutions he chose therefore to raise the siege and endeavour to obtain the princess by way of negotiation An ambassador was sent to Padmani loaded with rich presents and the most passionate letters Akebar  represented to the princess that she had given proofs enough of the fidelity due to her husband that it was now time to make some condescension in favour of a great emperor and her own interest that her tenderness for Rana could not better appear than by procuring the liberty of her captive husband that by redeeming Rana from his captivity she might make herself the greatest queen in the world  They shewed her at the same time letters extorted from the captive prince in which he conjured her to make herself happy by setting him at liberty The heroine rightly apprehended that Rana's was only a forced consent and that her own glory depended upon an inviolable fidelity to him yet she thought it not unlawful to play the hypocrite and deceive a deceiver who had robbed her of her husband She let the Mogul understand that she began to waver in her resolution and that ambition had shaken her constancy that if her vows did not bind her indispensibly to Rana she would think herself happy in being sultaness to so great a prince but that she had sworn to her first husband by all their gods that she would never be the wife of another without an express consent from his own mouth that the emperor might chuse either to suffer Rana to come to Chitor or permit Padmani to go and demand her husband's consent in the place of his captivity  Akebar embraced the last proposal and consented to let the princess come with a good guard to pay her husband a visit A castle in the neighbourhood of Agra was Rana's prison it is impossible  to express the impatience of Akebar for the arrival of a princess at his capital for whom he had expended such vast treasures and exposed himself to so many dangers Couriers upon couriers were dispatched to entreat her not to defer her departure The emperor sent her presents every hour of jewels fruits and a mysterious kind of nosegays which are made use of in the east to express by matching of flowers the sentiments of the heart  The princese got ready her equipage with all possible speed the most sumptuous pallanquins were prepared for her journey These are a kind of Indian chaises in which people of quality are carried on the shoulders of ten or a dozen slaves they are long enough to sleep in as in a litter those for the men are open at top but the women's are close and of a much larger size Four may sit conveniently in one of them so that there is need of twenty slaves to bear those in which the princesses are carried  Padmani shut up eight of the bravest of her subjects in the two pallanquins and enjoined them a profound silence during the journey for her own part she remained at Chitor and sent away the pallanquins with a good guard The project was executed with so much secrecy that the whole town was deceived The people were all in tears at the supposed departure of their princess and followed the pallanquins in crouds out of the town Mean time Padmani keeping very private in her palace had the pleasure to see the sorrow of her people for their imaginary loss  As soon as the emperor was informed that the princess was set out for Agra he appointed several persons to meet and compliment her The princess's first eunuch who managed the intrigue and was shut up in the pallanquin in which the princess was supposed to be made answers for her Among other things he let the emperor know in the name of Padmani that if she met with the least interruption in her journey or was hindered from proceeding directly to her husband without going through the capital or even if she was disturbed in her conversation with Rana that she was determined to stab herself with a dagger which she brought for that purpose and held ready in her hand for fear of any surprise  Akebar had not a thought of making the least opposition to the princess's will He sent her word that she should be at full liberty to see Rana to discourse with him and bid him adieu The nearer the pallanquins approached Agra the more couriers were dispatched to wait on them They were met by them at every village and still the eunuch gave answers to the letters of Akebar About half a day's journey from Agra and three or four leagues from the castle where Rana was prisoner they met a magnificent equipage which the emperor had sent to receive the princess The Rageputes arrived about the evening at the place where Rana was prisoner  The two pallanquins only and some officers of Padmani's guard were permitted to enter the castle these officers together with the Rageputes shut up in the pallanquins dispatched the governor of the castle who first advanced to receive the princess  afterwards becoming matters of the guard they delivered Rana from his imprisonment They mounted him on a very fleet horse and as they had posted change enough on the road the raja soon arrived at Chitor where he made Padmani all the acknowledgments due to his deliverer  Mean time Akebar was waiting impatiently in a garden for the arrival of the princess When word was brought him that Rana had made his escape and that some armed men had been concealed in the pallanquins instead of Padmani he commanded the messenger's head to be struck off who brought this news but coming to himself a moment after he was contented to forbid him his presence for ever "Pursue pursue Rana" cries he but Rana was got too far on his road to be overtaken As to the Rageputes who had served as a convoy to the pallanquins after having marched all night with great expedition they found themselves about the morning in the territories of a raja and a friend to the prince of Chitor and at last got safe into their own country  As soon as Rana was returned to his fortress he wrote an insulting letter to Akebar he reproached him with his perfidiousness and rallied him on the ill success of his amours he haughtily defied him to come a second time to try his fortune against the citadel of Chitor and added that after having been baffled and outwitted by a woman he might very well expect to be vanquished by an army of Rageputes who waited his arrival with impatience Rana did more than insult his enemy with letters he erected in the marketplace of Chitor a pillar on which were engraven these words  Never trust the Moguls who have betrayed you  The behaviour of Rana and the indifference of the princess Padmani provoked Akebar to such a degree that he was no longer master of himself Once more he assembled his troops he augmented his artillery he prepared machines in a word he made such provision for the siege of Chitor that he believed the taking of it infallible In this assurance he surrounded the place on every side he raised platforms on which he planted his engines the assaults were furious and were equally sustained  The Mogul was now no more that amorous prince who seemed tender of the lives of his princess's people but an emperor enraged to the last degree who came to avenge a personal affront The two principals were continually attentive one to push the siege and the other to defeat it Rana scarce ever quitted the ramparts where he encouraged his men and repaired the breaches Akebar on his side often mounted the platforms and gave his orders for forming the attacks One day as Akebar was taking a view of the place from one of those platforms almost equal in heighth with the walls of Chitor he perceived an officer walking carelesly on the ramparts he took aim with his fusee and shot the raja dead upon the spot Two days after the emperor had an account that he had killed his rival that his body was burned in great pomp and that the generous Padmani according to the custom of the Ragepute princesses had thrown herself into the flames and mingled her ashes with those of her husband Chitor still made some resistance but at last was forced to yield to the valour and fortune of Akebar  THE LADY's GEOGRAPHY  DESCRIPTION of the Island of CEYLON Continued from Page  THIS country though mountainous is watered by a great number of very fine rivers which fall from the mountainsmost of them are too full of rocks to be navigable but they contain fish in great abundance The river of Mavelagongue which is the principal of them has its source in the Picus Adami of which we shall give a description hereafter it traverses the whole island towards the north and falls into the sea at Trinquemale Its breadth is about a cross bow shot the rocks which render it very little navigable afford harbour and retreat to a great number of alligators It runs within a quarter of a league of the town of Candi but as the rapidity of its waters will not admit of any bridge being built over it it can only be crossed in little canoes It is moreover a point of policy amongst the inhabitants who are far from desirous to render travelling commodious in their country but rather chuse to embarrass the roads as much as possible In some places this river flows for leagues together without meeting any interruption from the rocks But the Ceylonese in general reap very little advantages from the waters either in the way of commerce or for the conveyance of goods  Excepting the province of Ouvah and the districts of Oudipollat and Dolusbang the whole island is covered with wood It is well peopled about the centre but very indifferently towards the borders The inhabitants do indeed shew many places where they pretend heretofore to have had very considerable cities the names of which the places retain to this day but there are scarcely the vestiges of any buildings remaining in them Knox who traversed the island several times takes notice of only five which can deserve that title and in which the king has palaces although they are all in ruins excepting that which he particularly inhabits Of these cities Candi or Conde is the chief It has the advantage of being placed in the centre of the island so that it may be approached with equal facility from every part of it Its form is triangular and according to the custom of the country the king's palace occupies the eastern angle of it It is fortified only to the south because the access to it is more open there than from any other quarter This fortification however is nothing more than a rampart of earth about twenty feet high which crosses the valley from one mountain to another All the avenues to the city for two or three miles distance are closed up with barriers of thorn and a continual guard always kept at them and the great river which comes down from the Picus Adami passes within a quarter of a league of it towards the south  The next city is Nellembyneur about twelve miles south of the preceding Alloutneur stands to the northeast of Candi where the king keeps  large magazines of corn and rice in reserve against the time of war Badoula which is the fourth city is two days journey from Candi towards the east of the province of Ouvah In this province the best tobacco in the island is cultivated it is very well watered but wood is scarce in it Rice and cattle however are in abundance in it with respect to which however this very singular circumstance is observable that the cattle reared there cannot live for any considerable time when transported into any other province the occasion of which is attributed to a certain shrub which is found in all the other provinces and not in this  The fifth and last of these cities is Digligyneur situated also to the east of Candi In this city the king has kept his court ever since the year when a revolt of his subjects drove him to quit Candi and with his departure began the ruin of that city It is situated in the province of Hevoiattay a country which is covered with mountains and rocks that render the soil of it extremely infertile Yet has the king chosen it for his residence as a place of security by being in the neighbourhood of a very high mountain called Gauldua which may on any occasion afford him a safe retreat and where as much rice may be gathered as will amply maintain the garrison of three forts which defend the entrance to it It is extremely sleep on all sides and so invested with rocks woods and precipices that a handful of men might stand their ground there against very numerous armies  As to the towns and villages of Ceylon altho' they are very numerous there are few of them that are worth a traveller's attention The most remarkable are those which are consecrated to their idols in which some of their Devals or temples may be seen The inhabitants give themselves very little trouble about making their streets strait or preserving any regularity in their houses each family living in a seperate building which is most usually surrounded with a hedge and ditch The Ceylonese never build in the high road as they do not chuse to be observed by passengers Their largest villages do not contain above a hundred houses Their usual number is about forty or fifty although there are some which consist of only eight or ten Besides which they quit them whenever sickness happens to be in any degree frequent amongst them or that two or three people chance to die within any small space of time They then imagine that the devil has taken possession of the place and therefore immediately abandon their lands and habitations in order to go in search of some more fortunate dwelling  The king's palace at Digligyneur is surrounded with a rampart of earth cased with thatch to prevent the rain's beating it down This inclosure is full of various irregular buildings most of them low and covered with stubble excepting some few whose roofs are tiled These latter have two stories with open galleries round them to let in air surrounded with ballusters some of ebony and others of painted wood The windows also are inlaid with plates of silver and ebony and the top of each edifice adorned with vases  of earth or moresque These several buildings form a kind of labyrinth to which there are a great number of very handsome gates two of which have drawbridges to them The porticoes of these are of a most admirable relief and even to the very locks and bolts are decorated with carved work At each of these doors and at every passage are placed centinels which are regularly relieved day and night  The common houses of the inhabitants are little low and thatched Nor are they allowed to build them with more than one story nor to cover them with tiles nor even to whiten the walls of them with lime though they have a kind of white clay which they might employ with advantage to this use As the country is very hot they for the most part neglect the plaistering of their walls contenting themselves with the branches and leaves of trees They have not even chimneys in their houses but make what fire is necessary for the preparation of their victuals in a corner of their apartment which blackens the floor very much The grandees have houses very handsome and commodious consisting for the most part of two buildings opposite to each other and united by a wall which forms a square court These walls are surrounded with borders of clay rubbed over with cow dung which renders them impenetrable by the rain Their domestics and slaves inhabit the houses round them  As to the temperature of the air it is very unwholsome in the southern parts though all the rest of the country enjoys a very pure and healthy air The vallies are for the most part marshy  and full of fine springs Those which have these qualities are looked on as the best because the rice which is the principal subsistence of the inhabitants requires a great deal of moisture  The variety which is observed in the air and rains in the different parts of this island are very remarkablewhen the west winds begin to blow the western parts have great falls of rain and this is the proper season to plough and till the ground and yet at the very same time the eastern parts of the island enjoy very dry weather and gather in their harvestOn the contrary when the wind blows from the east they plough and till in the easterly parts and gather in the corn in the opposite ones towards the westThus the business of ploughing and harvest employs the islanders almost all the year round in different seasons of the year  This division of rain and drought is made about the middle of the island and it frequently happens that there is rain on one side of the mountain of Cauragahing whilst it is extremely hot and dry on the other side of it It is also remarked that this difference is no less violent than it is sudden for on the quitting a very wet spot of ground you shall come immediately into a soil the heat of which shall scorch and burn your feet  The southern parts of the island however are not subject to this great quantity of wet weatherfor there will sometimes continue there for three or four years together so great and constant a drought that the ground shall be incapable of  receiving any kind of culture It is even difficult to dig any wells thereabouts deep enough to get water that can be drank and even the very best that is to be got retains an acrimony and brackishness which renders it extremely disagreeable  On the south of Candi and at about fourteen or fifteen leagues from Colombo is a mountain which is looked on as the highest in the island and which from its height and form which is nearly that of a sugarloaf is very distinctly to be seen not only all through the island but even at upwards of a dozen miles out at sea This is the famous Picus Adami whereof all the travellers who have ever been in this country have spoken with so much admiration On a large flat stone which is at the top of it is an impression resembling that of a man's foot but upwards of twice the natural size of one The general superstition is that this mark was left there by the foot of our first parent from whom therefore the mountain receives its name In short were we to recount all the fabulous things that the Ceylonese introduce in their history of this mountain it would be only abusing the patience of our fair readers let it suffice then to give a plain description of the place such as it is only adding that these people look on it as a meritorious action to go and pay their adorations to this foot especially on the first day of the year which falls with them in the month of March at which time are to be seen immense processions of men women and children who have undertaken this pilgrimage  Before you come then to the foot of the mountain you meet with a very large and pleasant plain watered with a great many rills which fall from the Pic and form at the bottom of it a pool to which the Gentiles frequently make a pilgrimage never failing to bathe themselves in it and wash their cloaths and linen also therein from a persuasion that that water has a virtue to efface all their sins After this first act of superstition they clamber to the top of the mountain by the assistance of iron chains affixed thereto and without which it would be impossible to get up so very steep is it although there have been steps wrought out in many parts of it The way to the top is at least a quarter of a league At a certain distance from the summit are erected two stone pillars surmounted by another stone which lies across them and to which is suspended a large bell made of metal having its clapper pierced with a hole big enough to pass an iron thong through it which all the pilgrims are obliged to pull and striking one stroke on the bell to try whether they are purified because these idolaters imagine that if they are not so the bell will give no sound This imaginary misfortune however never happens to them The summit of the mountain presents a plain surface of an hundred and fifty paces in length and an hundred and ten in breadth in the middle of which is the flat stone which it is said bears the impression of a gigantic human foot two palms long and eight inches broad There are some trees planted about this stone and to the left of it are a few huts whither the pilgrims retire On the right  hand there was formerly a very fine pagod whereof the Ceylonese relate wonders and Baldeus describes sixtyeight statues and figures which are to be met with in different cavities of the mountain From the Picus Adami as we have observed before issue most of the rivers which water the island of Ceylon  NATURAL HISTORY of CEYLON  This island produces a great quantity of rice in the cultivation of which the industry of the inhabitants renders itself extremely conspicuous for when we come to consider how necessary water is in the culture of that grain and at the same time recollect that great part of the island is extremely mountainous it will appear wonderful that it should be so fertile as it is The manner however that the Ceylonese have contrived for rendering it so is by levelling the sides of these mountains at certain stages from three to eight feet in breadth so as to form a kind of staircase from the bottom of the hill to the uppermost of these stages in which they sow their rice Now as the island is very much visited with rain and that there is besides a great frequency of springs on the mountains they have found means to dig large reservoirs nearly on a level with the highest springs from whence the water is made to fall on the uppermost rows and from them gradually to the others so as to keep them continually supplied with water Some of these reservoirs are half a league in length some less and their depth usually from two to three yards  There are several kinds of rice distinguishable in the island of Ceylon which are defined by different names although they differ very little in their taste and indeed scarcely in any thing more than the length of time they take in ripening Some is seven months in coming to perfection whilst some will ripen at six five four or three months end That which is soonest ripe is the best tasted but does not yield so plentifully There is even a kind which ripens in dry ground and is therefore sowed in those places where it is not in the power of art to convey water This would be a very great treasure to the inhabitants of the eastern parts were it not much inferior to the other kinds both in taste and smell  Besides the rice this island furnishes various sorts of grain which although by no means approaching to it in goodness are nevertheless a very good resource in times of scarcity They have also great quantities of excellent fruits but they might reap much more advantage from them if they were sufficiently fond of them to bestow some care on their cultivation But as they pay very little regard to those which have nothing agreeable in them but their taste and cannot serve them by way of food when the grain is at any time deficient the only trees which they plant are those that produce nutritive fruits The other kinds grow of themselves and what still diminishes the care of the inhabitants is that in all places where nature produces any delicious fruits the officers of the country tie a label round the tree in the king's name with three knots at the  end of it which being done no one dares touch it without running the hazard of a very severe punishment and sometimes even of death The fruit when ripe is generally carried in a white linen cloth to the governor of the province who selecting the finest wraps it up in another linen cloth and sends it to court keeping the rest for himself and returning none to the proprietors  THE LADY's MUSEUM  The TRIFLER NUMBER X  MADAM  _IN a life of sixtyfour years alas how times are altered when I was young what dread and reverence were paid to omens dreams visions blue burning candles knives and forks across each other salt spilt by aukwardness and every kind of prognostic that led into the avenues of fate The present times or rather the last twenty years of my existence treat these important points as trifles Owls screech unheard I myself dream and repeat my dreams unregarded Thieves appear in the watchlights and we lose a marrowspoon the next

of a dog without a head but she poor woman is looked upon as doating Jett my little spaniel I am sure often sees something that comes from the other world but Jett's a dog and can only bark at it  What a pity it is madam that we cannot at the same time when we abhor the superstitions of popery retain that veneration I had almost said duty to celestial warnings which no longer ago than the protestant reign of good queen Anne I can very well remember had an influence over every action of our lives  It was then madam that a windingsheet in the candle or a cinder coffin jumping out of the fire sent many a wicked maid to her prayers and repentance for a whole week together  It was then madam that doctor Aaron Sandford the stargazing haberdasher of Bednal green and doctor Duncan Campbell the deaf and dumb conjurer in Buckingham Court were followed and revered with as true devotion as the methodists are in these wicked days  Witches indeed have pretty well kept their ground notwithstanding the thunder of an act of parliament and the execution of poor Thomas Colley only for stifling Ruth Osborne the witch of Tring in a pond of water It is not six months ago since I read an account in one of the newspapers of a witch in Northumberland The best people in the parish assembled to take her they surrounded  her house boldly and in a body they burst open the door but they found she was flown probably up the chimney and upon a broomstick  My mother and my grandmother have often informed me of many wonderful noises apparitions and visions that have been seen and heard in

GRACE PYTHONESS  THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT AND SOPHIA CONTINUED  THE first thought that struck the amazed Sophia was that Sir Charles either following the motions of his natural inconstancy or in revenge of her supposed contempt of him had married Harriot Certain that she had now lost for ever this lover who with all his real or imputed faults she had never been able to banish from her heart she resigned herself up to the sharpest agonies of despair and had already arrived at her sister's house before she was able to stop the course of her tears  A servant in the livery of her own family opened the door This circumstance surprised Sophia who pulling her hat over her eyes to conceal her disorder asked him with some hesitation if his mistress was at home  The fellow replied he believed she was and opening the coachdoor shewed her into a parlour telling her with a smart air that he would enquire of his lady's woman whether she was visible yet or no  Sophia having summoned all her fortitude to enable her to go through this severe trial with dignity had time enough to recollect and compose herself before any one appeared and now several circumstances rushed upon her memory which in the first transports of her astonishmentt and grief had escaped her attention  Mrs Darnley in her letter had not mentioned Harriot's marriage but barely said she had left her The servant who delivered her message called her miss Darnley and though she lived in a house that belonged to Sir Charles yet it was scarcely suitable to the quality of his wife  A few moments reflection upon these appearances made the generous Sophia change the object of her concern The misfortune for which she had grieved so much seemed light compared with that she apprehended she wept no longer for the inconstancy of her lover she trembled for the honour of her sister and her greatest fear now was that Sir Charles was not married  While she was absorbed in these melancholy thoughts Harriot's maid entered the room who after glancing over Sophia with a supercilious eye for she was very simply drest asked her  If she had any business with her lady  Tell her replied Sophia that her sister is here  The girl blushed courtesied and flew to acquaint her mistress and Sophia was instantly desired to walk up stairs  She found Harriot in her dressingroom in an elegant dishabille having just finished her morning's  work which appeared in a suit of ribbons made up with great taste  As soon as she saw Sophia she rose from her chair and saluted her with affected dignity but at the same time with an air of embarrassment that encreased every moment so that being unable to bear the sweet but penetrating looks of her sister she resumed her work altering and unripping without any apparent design yet affecting to be extremely busy and to shew how perfectly she was at ease talked of the most trifling matters imaginable while Sophia gazed on her in silent anguish anxious to know the truth of her situation yet dreading to have it explained At length she told her that she was going to Kensington to her mother and desired to know if she had any message to send to her  Harriot suddenly interupting her as if she feared some further questions began to exclaim against her mother's unreasonable temper saying that she had offended her violently only because she had it not in her power to comply with some very extravagant expectations which she had formed  Sister said Sophia I am wholly ignorant of your affairs I know not what cause of discontent you have given my mother but I see there is a great alteration in your condition of life and I hope  What do you hope pray miss interrupted Harriot reddening I suppose I am to have some of your satirical flings your temper is not altered I find  Dear Harriot resumed Sophia with tears in her eyes this causeless anger confirming her suspicions why do you reproach me with being satirical is it a crime to be anxious for your happiness  I wish you would not trouble yourself about me replied Harriot I know best what will make me happy you should not pretend to instruct your elders miss Sophy I am older than you you know you have often upbraided me with that  Sister said Sophia calmly you desired to see me have you any thing to say to me  I know answered Harriot that I shall meet with ungrateful returns for my kindness nevertheless I shall act like a sister towards you and it was to tell you so that I wished to see you I very much doubt whether if you were in prosperity you would do the same by me  Have I behaved so ill in adversity then said Sophia that you form this harsh judgment of me sister  Pray don't upbraid me with your behaviour miss said Harriot other people may have behaved as well as you though they are not prudes  You say you are in prosperity sister said Sophia but perhaps you and I have different notions of prosperity let me know the truth of your situation and if I find you happy according to my notions of happiness you will soon be convinced that I can take a sister's share in it  I am not obliged to give an account of my conduct to you replied Harriot who had listened to this speech with great emotion and I must tell you sister Sophy that if you go on taking this liberty of questioning and censuring me I shall not care how seldom I see you As to my mother I know that it is my duty to do every thing for her that is in my power and this I have offered to do already  Saying this she rang the bell and her maid appearing she gave her some orders which necessarily required her attendance in the room so that Sophia finding she could have no further discourse with her sister rose up and took leave of her with an aching heart Her griefs all aggravated by the apprehension of her sister's dishonour and the hatred which she felt for Sir Charles as her seducer struggling with a tender remembrance her gentle bosom was torn with conflicting passions and she proved but too well the truth of that maxim That philosophy easily triumphs over past and future evils but the  present  triumph over her  Mrs Darnley received her daughter with unusual tenderness she felt how much she stood in need of her filial care and her behaviour was dictated by that interested kindness which only gives in expectation of receiving back doublefold  Sophia saw her pale and emaciated and was greatly affected with the sight she would not mention her sister for fear of discomposing her but Mrs Darnley soon introduced the subject that was most in her thoughts and exclaimed against  Harriot's undutifulness and want of affection with the most violent transports of passion  I have been the best of mothers to her said she melting into tears I have always indulged her in all her wishes and impaired my circumstances to support her extravagancies and how has she returned this kindness would you think it my dear Sophy though she is in affluent circumstances and I by the loss of my annuity am plunged into all my former distresses she has refused to pay those debts which I contracted during the time she lived with me and thinks it sufficient to invite me to reside in her house where no doubt I should feel my dependence severely  Sir Charles said Sophia sighing does not act with his usual generosity if he has married my sister why does he suffer you to be in distress  "Married your sister" repeated Mrs Darnley in astonishment  Ah madam resumed Sophia is she not married then to Sir Charles  Why is it possible that you can wish him to be married to Harriot  said Mrs Darnley  Alas cried Sophia ought I not to wish it when I see her in his house  Oh resumed Mrs Darnley I perceive your mistake but that house is not Sir Charles's now Lord L bought it of him with the furniture some time ago it might have been yours and without any offence to your virtue too yet you thought fit to refuse it but I  will not pretend to reprove one so much wiser than myself  Well madam interrupted Sophia eagerly then it is not to Sir Charles that my sister is married to whom is she married  "You have seen her have you not" said Mrs Darnley looking a little confused  I have indeed seen her said Sophia but she did not explain her situation to me  And do you imagine resumed Mrs Darnley peevishly that she would be less reserved with her mother and if she was afraid of telling you the truth is it likely she would own it to me  Then I fear it is bad indeed with Harriot cried Sophia in a melancholy accent since she has so much to conceal from a mother and a sister  You were always censorious Sophy said Mrs Darnley with some passion for my part I am resolved to think the best If Lord Lis married privately to your sister her character will one day be cleared to the world and she thinks no prudent person can blame her for chusing to bear for a time a few undeserved censures rather than to struggle with poverty and contempt  Sophia now convinced of Harriot's unhappy conduct burst into tears Mrs Darnley after looking at her in silence a moment said with some confusion  Then you do not believe your sister is married Sophy  Ah madam replied Sophia you do not say that you know she is and whatever reasons there  might be for concealing her marriage from the world certainly there are none for hiding it from youIn vain added she with still greater emotion would your parental tenderness seek to deceive yourself  Reproach me no more with my tenderness for your sister interrupted Mrs Darnley angrily I am too much affected with her ingratitude already  I am sorry she is ungrateful said Sophia but oh my dear mama it is not fit you should accept of her assistance  I hope said Mrs Darnley calling down her eyes that I know what is fit for me to do as well as my daughterBut Sophy added she after a little pause I am sorry to tell you if you do not know it already that if you have still any thoughts of Sir Charles you deceive yourself I am very well informed that a match has been proposed to him and he has given so favourable an answer that it is expected the marriage will be concluded as soon as he comes from Paris I heard it all from one of the young lady's relations  This was a severe stroke to poor Sophia who had just begun to breathe again after the anguish she had suffered in the belief that Sir Charles had forsaken her for her sister and added perfidy and baseness to his inconstancy  Mrs Darnley who saw her turn pale and her eyes swimming in tears while she struggled to conceal her emotions could not help being affected  with her distress and endeavoured to console her  Sophia more softened by this tenderness suffered her tears to flow a few moments unrestrained then suddenly wiping her charming eyes  Pardon this weakness madam said she this indeed is not a time to weep for myself your sorrows claim all my tears  Aye I have sorrows enough Heaven knows said Mrs Darnley my debts unpaid my annuity gone what have I to trust to  Providence interrupted Sophia your piety and my industry Alas my dear mama your greatest affliction is not the loss of your annuity or the debts with which you are encumbered it is my sister's unhappy fall from virtue That parent pursued she who sees a beloved child become a prey to licentious passions who sees her publicly incur shame and reproach expelled the society of the good and virtuous and lead a life of dishonour embittered with the contempt of the world and the secret upbraidings of her own conscience that parent can best judge of your anguish now I have only a sister's feelings for this misfortune but these feelings are strong enough to make me very unhappy  Mrs Darnley appeared so much moved with this discourse that Sophia pursued it till she brought her mother to declare that she would rather suffer all the inconveniencies of poverty than give a sanction to Harriot's guilt by partaking of its reward  Sophia to relieve her anxiety laid down a plan for their future subsistence and proved to her that by her skill in several little useful arts it would be easy for her to supply her with all the necessaries of life "We will first said she pay your debts"  "How is that to be done" said Mrs Darnley hastily  The furniture of your house said Sophia the plate and other pieces of finery which Sir Charles Stanley presented to you will if converted into money not only pay your debts but provide a little fund for present expences and a reserve for future exigencies mean while my industry and care will I hope keep want far from you I have friends who will find employment for my little talents and if I can but make your life easy and comfortable I shall think myself happy  Mrs Darnley with tears in her eyes embraced her daughter bid her dispose of every thing as she pleased and assured her she would endeavour to bear her new condition of life with patience and resignation  Sophia immediately wrote to a gentleman of the law who had been an intimate friend of her father's▪ and he undertook to manage their little affairs in town A few days afterwards he brought them fifty pounds which was all that remained from the sale after every demand upon Mrs Darnley was paid  She read over the accounts with great emotion bitterly regretting every trinket she had  parted with and told Sophia that it was absolutely necessary they should settle in some village near town for she could not bear the thoughts of exposing her poverty to her acquaintance and of being seen in a worse condition than formerly  Sophia who thought her declining health a better reason for not residing in London hired in an adjacent village at a very small rent a little house or rather cottage so neat and situated so happily that an imagination lively as hers was and a little romantick could not fail of being charmed with it To this place she removed her books and being provided by her friend Dolly with an innocent country girl for a servant she conducted her mother to her rural abode and had the satisfaction to find her pleased with it novelty having always charms for her and here for a few days it supplied the place of those other gratifications to which she had been accustomed  In the midst of these cares Sophia did not forget her unhappy sister she wrote several letters to her in which she employed all the power of virtuous eloquence to bring her to a sense of her errors but in vain  Harriot did not deign to answer her but in a letter to her mother she complained of the injurious treatment she received from Sophia and earnestly intreated her to leave her sister and reside with her  Although Mrs Darnley refused this offer with seeming steadiness yet her discontent was but too apparent A life of retirement which often obliged  her to seek in herself those resources against languor and melancholy which she used to find in the dissipations of the town could not be grateful to one who had never accustomed herself to reflection whose mind was filled with trifles and its whole stock of ideas derived from dress cards and every other fashionable folly  To be capable of enjoying a rural life there is something more necessary than a good understandin innocence and purity of manners must contribute to give a relish to pleasures which are founded in reason virtue and piety  Hence it was that Sophia in the bloom of youth found happiness in the solitude of a village while her mother in a declining age panted after the vanities of the town  In vain did Mr Herbert fill the letters he wrote to Mrs Darnley with maxims of morality and pious admonitions he experienced here the truth of that observation that it is a work of great difficulty to dispossess vice from a heart where long possession seems to plead prescription  Sophia who knew her mother's taste for living at ease that she might be able to gratify it applied herself diligently to her work which was a piece of embroidery that had been bespoke by a benevolent lady in order to give her present employmen and by exhibiting it as a proof of her ingenuity to procure her more She likewise exercised her invention in drawing little designs for fanmounts and always chose such subjects as conveyed some moral lesson to the mind while they pleased the imagination  Some of these drawings were disposed of by the lady her friend so advantageously that Sophia was encouraged to pursue her labour and Mrs Darnley flattered by the prospect of more easy circumstances began to enlarge her scheme of expence made little excursions about the country in a postchaise talked of hiring a better house and of passing two months at least in London during the winter  Mean time Harriot became more earnest in her solicitations to her mother to come and live with her her situation began to be so generally suspected that she was in danger of being wholly neglected  She wrote to her in a strain of tenderness and duty that revived all the illjudging parent's affection who invited her to make her a visit in her little retreat and promised her a favourable reception even from Sophia herself  Sophia was indeed far from opposing this visit she was rather desirous of drawing her sister thither frequently with a hope that her example and her arguments might one day influence her to change her conduct  Harriot received this invitation with joy for such was the depravity of her mind that she exulted in having an opportunity of displaying the granduer of her dress and equipage to her sister to her who had made virtuous poverty her choice and shewn that she despised riches when they were to be purchased by guilt  The pride of human nature  says an eminent writer  takes its rise from its corruption as worms are produced by putrefaction  The wretched fallen Harriot was proud the diamonds that glittered in her hair the gilt chariot and the luxurious table these monuments of her disgrace contributed to keep up the insolence of a woman who by the loss of her honour was lower than the meanest of her servants who could boast of an uncorrupted virtue  Sophia was busily employed upon her embroidery when Harriot from her gay chariot alighted at her door she entered that humble abode of innocence and industry in a kind of triumph and accosted her sister with a haughty expression of superiority in her looks and air as if she expected the splendor of her appearance should strike her with awe  Sophia received her with the modest dignity of conscious virtue and Harriot tho' incapable of much reflection yet soon perceived the miserable figure she made in the presence of such a character and stood silent and abashed while Sophia contemplated her finery with an eye of pity and of anguish  Harriot at length recovering herself asked for her mother who that moment entered the room The sight of her daughter's equipage had thrown her into an agreeable flutter of spirits and she readily pardoned the fine lady all the faults of the ungrateful child  Harriot emboldened by so kind a reception proposed to her to accompany her to town promising to make her abode with her agreeable by every instance of duty and affection  Mrs Darnley blushed and was silent Sophia fixed her eyes upon her mother anxious and impatient for her answer she cast a timed glance at Sophia she read in her speaking eyes her sentiments of this proposal and turning to Harriot she told her faintly that not being satisfied with her conduct it would be very improper for her to countenance it by residing with her  Harriot burst into tears and exclaimed against her sister's malice who she said acted like her most cruel enemy and sought to ruin her character by estranging herself from her company and preventing her mother from taking notice of her  Sophia with great gentleness proved to her that the loss of her reputation was the necessary consequence of her living in a manner unsuitable to her circumstances that her mother and her by complying with her request could not preserve her from censure but would incur it themselves  You call me cruel Harriot said she for estranging myself from your company but consider a little whether it is not you that are both cruel and unjust Why would you deprive me of the only reward the world bestows on me for a life of voluntary poverty you have exchanged a good name for dress and equipage and I to preserve one subject myself to labour and indigence you enjoy your purchase but I should lose mine were I to have that complaisance for you which you require Leave me  my reputation then since it is the sole recompence of those hardships to which I willingly submit and if you wish to recover yours be contented to be poor like me  Sophia finding her sister listened to her tho' it was sullenly and with down cast eyes expatiated in a tender manner upon the errors of her conduct and the fatal consequences that were likely to follow  Harriot at length interrupted her with a pert air and said  She would not be taught her duty by her younger sister  then turning to her mother  I hope madam said she my sister will not have so much power with you as to make you forbid my coming here  She put her handkerchief to her eyes as she said this to which Mrs Darnley replied with great vehemence  That no person on earth should ever prevail upon her to cast off her child  Sophia was silent and observing that her presence seemed to lay them under some restraint she rose up to retire to her work telling her sister as she passed by her  That far from hindering her visits she would rather encourage her to repeat them often that she might be convinced it was possible to be happy in a cottage  Harriot laughed and muttered the words romantick and affectation which Sophia took no notice of but left her at liberty to converse freely with her mother  Mrs Darnley talked to her at first in a chiding strain and affected to assume the authority of a parent but a slave to her appetites she could not  resist any opportunity of gratifying them and Harriot found it no difficult matter to force a present upon her to supply those expences which her extravagance and not her wants made necessary  Harriot now came often to the village and gave it out that she was upon the best terms imaginable with her mother and sister not doubting but the world would cease to suspect her since Sophia approved her conduct  The frequency and the length of her visits made Sophia entertain hopes of her reformation since the time she spent with her mother was taken from that dangerous and immoral dissipation which forms the circle of what is called a gay life For it is with our manners as with our health the abatement of vice is a degree of virtue the abatement of disease is a degree of health  Mr Herbert being perfectly recovered filled Sophia with extreme joy by the account he sent her of it and of his resolutlon to come and live near her  While she impatiently expected his arrival and sent many a longing look towards the road near which her little cottage was situated she one day saw a gentleman ride by full speed who in his person and air had a great resemblance to Sir Charles Stanley Her heart by its throbbing emotion seemed to acknowledge its conqueror for poor Sophia was still in love she loved though she despaired of ever being happy and by thus persisting in a hopeless passion contradicted that maxim that love like fire cannot subsist without  continual motion and ceases to be as soon as it ceases to hope or fear  Sophia not able to remove her eyes from the place where she fancied she had seen Sir Charles continued to look fixedly towards the road and was beginning to believe she had been mistaken when a servant in Sir Charles's livery rode by also and put it out of doubt that she had really seen the master  This unexpected incident awakened a thousand tender melancholy ideas in her mind and finding herself too much softened she had recourse again to her work to divert her imagination from an object she had vainly endeavoured to forget  To be concluded in our next  THE JUDGMENT of PARIS A POEM Sent to the Author of the Lady's Museum by a Friend  Nobis forma placet

the year his father was a merchant of linen cloth his mother employed herself in embroidery which requiring some small knowledge in design she taught her son in the best manner she could the first rudiments of drawing in which he made so quick progress that he soon became capable of giving instructions to his former tutor his mother conceived so great hopes of his future advancement in the arts that she persuaded his father to place him with Rubens who was the most celebrated painter of that time Vandyck soon became a favourite of his master's not only for his good behaviour and ingenious disposition but from the real advantage he was likely to find in having a scholar that would so soon be capable of assisting him The first thing Rubens set him about was to make a drawing after his picture of the battle of the Amazons  in which he succeeded so well that from that very drawing the print which is so much admired was engraved after this Rubens thought it time to instruct him in the art of colouring that he might likewise be of assistance to him in painting He first employed him in copying his works in which he acquitted himself so well that his master after giving a few touches sold them as his own performance He soon after made so great progress that he executed great works in colours from his master's designs and afterwards from his own invention particularly the history of Achilles  Those pictures were in Dr Mead's possession and sold at his sale  which was intended for a suit of tapestry It is reported that Rubens got no less then ten pounds a day by the labours of his ingenious disciple  This was a very considerable sum in those days  Rubens began now to be not a little alarmed at the extraordinary talents he discovered in his disciple and with good reason fearing he might rival his renown advised him after bestowing great commendations on some portraits Vandyck had just finished to apply himself entirely to the study of portraitpainting and at the same time continually recommending to Vandyck those who applyed for their portraits to himself he in a great measure stifled that true spirit and genius of painting which ought to have been exerted in the invention and composition of history Thus Titian but a little more barbarously banished Tintoret from his house a  practice often used by the great masters but as unsuccessful as malicious For strength of genius like a spark of fire will at last blaze up and perhaps with greater force from its meeting with opposition The first picture Vandyck painted after he had withdrawn from the school of his master was for the church of Dominick the subject was that of our Saviour bearing the cross on his knees accompanied by the two Marys with soldiers conducting him to Mount Calvary this work is much in the style of his master  He now began to think it time to visit Italy and accordingly set out for Venice where he applied himself wholly to the study of the Venetian art of colouring particularly the works of Titian and Paul Veronese the same fountains that had before so liberally supplied his master He copied many historical pictures for his improvement and painted portraits for his subsistence but the former producing no money and the latter not sufficient for his expences he thought fit to remove to Geneva where he found the greatest encouragement for his talent of portraitpainting Notwithstanding which being determined to visit Rome he undertook that journey and at his arrival there is entertained in the court of cardinal Bentivoglio a great favourer of the Flemish nation having himself lived there a considerable time and writ the history of that country In return for the civility he received he drew his patron's picture whole length which is now in the Palazzo Piti at Florence and esteemed one of the best of Vandyck's works he drew also for the same cardinal Christ dying on the cross  Sir Robert Shirly arriving at Rome about this time with the character of ambassador from Abba king of Persia to Gregory XV Vandyck drew his picture and his wife's both in the Persian habit which bizar kind of dress gave a new lustre to the usual graces of his painting  There was many of Vandyck's countrymen at that time studying at Rome and it was a custom amongst them that a newcomer should always invite his countrymen and brother students to a supper where in the midst of their mirth they used to give him a nickname by which he was ever after to be known This kind of revel Vandyck refused which they took so ill at his hands that since he would not submit to receive any other name they were resolved to give him that of Ambitious and they took all occasions to condemn in him his pride and his art together  In reality Vandyck had a certain stateliness and gravity in his air which might easily be mistaken for pride his manner of behaviour the richness of his habits with the number of his servants seemed all too high for his employment This fault if it is one is very pardonable having been used to such magnificence in the school of his master Rubens whilst he was there conversing mostly with noblemen and people of the higher fashion and being himself of a temper somewhat elevated he was naturally led to model himself on their behaviour  The true reason of Vandyck's journey to Rome appears to be not so much to study as to shew  his excellence in his art but meeting with too much hatred and illwill from his countrymen and not so much encouragement from others as he expected he left Rome and returned to Genoa which he used to call his home and there his reputation and profit were very considerable He drew most of the noblemen and senators of the place particularly the family of the Raggi  To be concluded in our next  THE TALE of GENEURA  From the Italian of LODOVICO ARIOSTO in the Fifth Book of his ORLANDO FURIOSO  THE noble Rinaldo sailing to England whither he was sent on an embassy by the emperor Charlemagne a violent storm arose which continuing two days and nights drove him at last on the coast of Scotland His fleet arriving safe he ordered his retinue to meet him at Berwick he himself without any attendants struck into the famous forest of Caledonia not without a hope of meeting with some adventure worthy his courage and virtue  While he was pleasing himself with this expectation sometimes riding and sometimes walking a slow pace leading his horse night drew on and he now began to think it necessary to go in quest of a lodging Perceiving an abbey at some distance he remounted his horse and rode up to it The abbot and his monks seeing a stranger of a noble appearance at their gate came out and with great civility invited him to pass the night there  Rinaldo gratefully accepted their offer and being conducted to a chamber and an elegant repast served to the table as soon as he had satisfied the  cravings of an appetite made eager by travel and long fasting he enquired of the good fathers what noble exploits in arms had been lately performed in their neighbourhood and whether a warrior might hope to find any occasions there of signalizing his valour  'Tis certain replied the abbot that many great and wonderful adventures have been atchieved in this forest but as the place so are the actions obscure and buried in oblivion however if honour be your pursuit the present time affords you a fit opportunity to acquire it the danger indeed is great but if you succeed eternal fame will be your reward The young and beautiful Geneura the daughter of our king is accused by a knight named Lurcanio of having violated her chastity and it is provided by our Scottish laws that all damsels of what rank soever who are publickly charged with incontinence shall suffer the punishment of fire unless a champion be found who will undertake their defence and fight with the accuser  Geneura in consequence of this law has been adjudged to die and only a month's space allowed her to procure a defender of her life and honour The king anxious for his daughter's safety but more for her reputation has caused it to be proclaimed throughout his dominions that by whatever person provided his birth be not absolutely base his daughter shall be delivered from the danger that threatens her to him he will give the princess in marriage with a portion suitable to her high rank and quality  This enterprize noble stranger is worthy your youth your courage and generosity the law of arms requires all true knights to undertake the defence of injured and oppressed ladies and surely a fairer than Geneura is not to be found from one extremity of the globe to the other nor if common opinion may be relied on a chaster  And is it possible said Rinaldo after a little pause that this fair princess is condemned to die for having generously rewarded the passion of a faithful lover Cursed be the makers of so hard a law more cursed they that are influenced by it For me it matters not whether Geneura be justly or unjustly accused what has been imputed to her as a crime were I her judge she should be applauded for had she taken care to have avoided discovery but as it is I am resolved to defy her accuser to combat and I trust shall be able to deliver her from the unjust and cruel punishment she has been doomed to  The abbot and monks overjoyed that they had procured a champion for their princess bestowed a thousand praises on Rinaldo for his generous design and he full of impatience to begin the glorious enterprize being furnished by his hosts with a guide set out early the next morning for the Scottish court leaving the good fathers charmed with his courage and gallantry and offering up repeated prayers to heaven for his success  As they were pursuing their journey through byeroads for the greater expedition a cry as of some person in distress rouzed all their attention Instantly Rinaldo clapped spurs to his horse and  galloping towards the place from whence the noise proceeded he came to a deep valley surrounded with trees through the branches of which he perceived a young maid struggling to free herself from the hands of two russians who were attempting to murder her Transported with rage at this sight the generous Rinaldo flew to the relief of the distressed damsel his appearance so terrified the intended murderers that they left their prey and fled with the utmost precipitation  Mean time the maid recovered from her fright thanked her deliverer with a transport of joy and gratitude and was beginning to acquaint him with the story of her misfortunes when he who had not alighted being eager to pursue his journey commanded his guide to take her up behind him and as they travelled having at leisure observed her countenance and behaviour he was so much struck with the beauty of the one and the soft and gentle modesty of the other that his curiosity was awakened and he became solicitous to know by what means she had been brought into so cruel a situation  His request being inforced with kind assurances of future protection the damsel with a low voice and eyes cast down in a graceful confusion began in this manner  Since you my generous deliverer have commanded me to relate my misfortunes prepare to hear a tale more full of horror an act of greater villainy and baseness than Athens Thebes or Argos ever knew Ah 'tis no wonder that our barren clime is curst with a long winter's ceaseless rage Phoebus disdains to shine upon a land where  such inhuman crimes are perpetrated deeds black as darkness and fit to be covered with everlasting night unhappy as I am I bore but too great a share in those I am going to relate  From my earliest youth I was brought up in the palace with the daughter of our king honoured with a near attendance on her person and happy in the possession of her affection and esteem Long might I have enjoyed this delightful situation but love ah that ever so sweet a passion should prove the source of so much misery love interrupted my tranquility subjected my whole soul and gave me up to guilt to shame and unavailing penitence  The duke of Alban was the object of my virgin wishes my youth and person pleased him skilled as he was in every deluding art by which the false and the designing part of his sex betray the unexperienced of ours is it any wonder that I was deceived Fond of believing what I wished and judging of his passion by my own I yielded to his desires and vainly hoped this sacrifice of my honour would secure to me for ever the possession of his heart  Our guilty commerce lasted some months during which time I always received his visits in a summer apartment belonging to the princess my mistress into which as it was now the most rigid season of the year she never entered and being also in a part of the palace little frequented and the windows opposite to some ruined houses my lover could come thither unobserved and by the help of  a silken cord which I let down to him easily ascend the chamber  All sense of virtue being now subdued and my whole soul sunk in a dear lethargick dream of pleasure I never once suspected that as my passion increased that of my lover was decreasing Ah my too violent love favoured his deceit or soon I might have perceived that he feigned much and loved but little  At length notwithstanding my prepossession his coldness became visible I sigh'd I wept I reproach'd alas how unavailing are all endeavours to revive a decaying passion satiated by possession and constant only to inconstancy  Polynesso so was my faithless lover named languished in secret for the bright Geneura my royal mistress I know not if this passion commenced before my ruin was completed or whether her more powerful charms was the cause of his infidelity but certain it is that relying on the fervent love I bore him he made no scruple to confess his flame even to me urging me by all the arguments his wicked mind could suggest to move the heart of Geneura in his favour  Ah my lord judge if this cruel man was dear to me ever solicitous to procure his happiness and soothed by his assurances that ambition was the prevailing motive of his address to the princess in which if he succeeded he vowed to keep me still his and that I should share with her his person and his heart I consented to all he proposed and following his instructions took all opportunities of praising him to my mistress  The duke of Alban was the constant subject of my discourse I extolled his valour his generosity his illustrious birth the manly graces of his person the mingled sweetness and dignity of his manners the charming theme transported me out of myself With eager pleasure I ran over all his virtues dwelt with delight on every imputed charm scarce could my tongue keep pace with the overflowings of my lovesick fancy fond of the dear indulgence of talking in a personated character of him I loved  But when in compliance with his injunctions I ventured to insinuate his passion for her then only did I speak with coldness and restraint slowly the unwilling words found way checked by my rising sighs and prefaced by my blushes My emotions could not have been hid from an interested observation but the princess was not only wholly indifferent to Polynesso but indulged a secret passion for the allaccomplished Ariodant  This young knight an Italian by birth came with his brother to the court of Scotland either in pursuit of glory or to transact some secret business with the king To the graces of his form than which nature never made one more lovely is added a mind fraught with whatever is most great and excellent in mankind his valour never yet found an equal in our land his is the prize at every tournement his the foremost honours of the field in peace the ornament of our court in war the defender of our country  The king to whom he had indeared himself by a thousand services loaded him with riches and honours and gave him the first employments in  the kingdom the hill of Sicily burns not with fiercer fires nor glows Vesuvius with more ardent flames than those which the bright eyes of our princess kindled in the heart of Ariodant  I soon discovered that Geneura approved encouraged and returned his passion and being as you may easily imagine not greatly concerned at this obstacle to the desires of my faithless duke I acquainted him with all I knew and from the apparent impossibility of his ever succeeding in his attempt drew arguments to induce him to give it over  Polynesso naturally haughty and vindictive could not bear with patience the thoughts of being rejected for a stranger every way as he conceived his inferior disdain shame rage by turns engrossed his soul and banished thence every softer passion his love for Geneura was now converted to the most obstinate hatred and he resolved to accomplish her ruin by the blackest treason that ever was conceived in the heart of man  His scheme of revenge concerted in which I alas tho' ignorantly was to act the chief part he one day accosted me with an air more tender and affectionate than usual  My dear▪ Dalinda said he generous and kind as you have been to me well may you think yourself injured by my inconstancy but as trees you know when cropt by the pruner's hand shoot out into fresh luxuriant branches so on the root of my passion for Geneura young buds of fondness rise and all the ripening fruit is yours  Nor do I languish so much for the possession of Geneura's beauties as I disdain to be thus rejected and contemned and lest this grief should prey too forcibly on my heart do thou my fair indulge my sick fancy with a kind deceit and in the dress of that too haughty charmer receive me to thy arms  When the princess is retired to bed put on her robes adorn thee with her richest jewels with her girdle bind thy swelling bosom let her coronet glitter on thy beauteous brow and beneath it let thy hair descend in graceful curls like hers then in her borrowed form attend my coming at the wellknown window thus shall my pride be gratified and my capricious fancy pleased  Without reflecting on the insidious purport of this request I promised to comply with it and for many succeessive nights received him in the habit he prescribed Having thus wrought me to his wish his wicked arts were next played off on Ariodant  Before the duke had any knowledge of his passion for the princess he had lived in strict friendship with this young knight and thence took occasion to reproach him with the breach of it by presuming to address the princess  In you said he I little expected a rival as well on account of your attachment to me as the improbability of your succeeding in your attempt for you are not now to be told of the mutual passion that has long joined Geneura's heart and mine nor that I intend soon to ask the king's consent to espouse her why then do you fondly thrust yourself  between me and my almost certain happiness how differently should I act were I in your place  Why this to me my lord replied Ariodant hastily 'tis you who have betrayed our friendship you have commenced my rival not I yours I claim a prior right in fair Geneura as having loved her first and have been happy enough to inspire her with an equal flame this you might have perceived had you not been blinded by obstinacy since then the laws of friendship demand one of us to yield be yours the task as having less right to persist and less hope of succeeding than myself In riches indeed you are my superior but the king's favour is equally shared betwixt us and in the heart of Geneura the advantage is wholly mine  What errors does not love occasion replied the duke each thinks himself the happy object of her wishes and yet 'tis certain that only one is loved thus then let us decide the contest he who can give the most certain proofs of her affection shall be left by the other in the free and undisturbed possession of it but first let us bind ourselves by the most solemn oaths not to disclose each others secrets  To this Ariodant with trembling impatience agreed and the artful duke went on in this manner  'Tis now almost five months since the beauteous Geneura rewarded my ardent love with the possession of her person oft has the conscious queen of night lent me her shades to guide me to my charmer and seen me happy in her arms  'Tis false by Heaven interrupted Ariodant transported with rage not that cold queen whose name thou hast profaned is chaster than my Geneura Traitor with my good sword I'll prove thou lyest take notice I defy thee to mortal combat and will with thy dearest blood wash away the slanders thou hast thrown upon my princess  Moderate your rage said the calm villain I mean to give you proofs convincing proofs of what I have said your own eyes shall be witnesses of the favours I enjoy  The unhappy Ariodant pale trembling and lost in speechless grief and horror at those fatal words stood for some moments fixed in racking thought like the sad statue of despair then raising his eyes overflowing with tears to heaven and passionately striking his groaning breast And can it be he cried that my Geneura that princess whom I loved whom I adored with such pure reverence as mortals pay to Deities should become the prey of loose desires and give her faithful Ariodant to death Oh 'tis impossible though a God spoke it I should say 'twere false  Incredulous man said Polynesso have I not offered to give thee proofs that cannot be denied Thy eyes shall see the favours she bestows on me  I take you at your word resumed Ariodant impatiently give me to behold her guilt and I am satisfied  Tomorrow night said the duke I have an appointment with her I will conduct you to a place from whence unperceived you yourself shall behold me ascend her chamber window and judge  by the reception she gives me if I am happy in her favour  To this the almost distracted Ariodant consented and at the appointed time followed the duke to those ruined houses I mentioned before and there stood concealed from view being doubtful of Polynesso's intentions he had ordered his brother Lurcanio to arm and go with him directing him to stay at a convenient distance so as to be within call if any treachery was offered him but not in sight of Geneura's window for he would have no witness of her guilt but himself  The duke having placed Ariodant most conveniently for his purpose advanced and gave the usual sign unhappy as I am I heard and eagerly obeyed the welcome summons adorned in Geneura's richest robes and covered with the veil that princesses only wear I appeared at the window and threw the silken ladder over to my lover  Lurcanio either fearing for his brother's safety or desirous of prying into his secrets quitted his appointed station and unperceived by him walked softly forward till he came within ten paces of Ariodant and now my faithless duke was seen by both the brothers though known only to Ariodant to ascend the ladder and gain the chamber window at which I met him with a tender embrace wandering over his lips and eyes with eager kisses  This sight so enflamed the soul of Ariodant with rage and grief that drawing out his sword and fixing the pummel of it in the ground he was going to rush with all his force upon the point had  he not been prevented by Lurcanio who perceiving his rash design sprang to him in an instant and having thrown aside the fatal instrument of death received his sinking brother in his arms  Ah miserable brother said Lurcanio by what wild fury art thou possest to fall thus meanly for a woman Now cursed for ever cursed be all the kind may they all perish in one wide ruin blown as they are like clouds with every blast of wind and this fair mischief that has betrayed thee let us devise some glorious vengeance for her let not thy noble life be sacrificed to her falshood her's is the crime be her's the punishment proclaim her guilt aloud accuse her to the king my eyes as well as thine have seen her infamy and with my sword I'll make good thy assertion  Ariodant whose soul was torn with various and conflicting passions smiled gloomily at the mention of revenge awhile he seemed to bury every thought of grief and of despair in that one hope of sacrificing the guilty princess to his wrongs but alas the cureless wound remained behind Geneura base as she appeared he loved with such unceasing fondness that wholly unable to endure her loss and dreading no hell like that within his bosom once more he resolved to die  To Lurcanio however he dissembled his design and went home with him at his request but early the next morning he departed leaving no traces behind him from whence it might be gathered to what place he was gone  Lurcanio dreading the fatal effects of his despair was pierced to his inmost soul at the news of  his flight the king and the whole court took part in his affliction no methods were left untried to discover where he was messengers were sent in search of him to the utmost extremities of the kingdom but all returned without any success  At length a peasant came to court and at his request was introduced to the princess who informed her that as he was travelling to the city he met Ariodant that this unhappy knight obliged him to follow him and be witness of a deed he was going to perform that obeying his orders they journeyed on together till they came to a steep rock that hung pendant over the sea fronting the Irish island  Ariodant said the peasant ascending this rock commanded me to observe well what he did to give you an account of it and tell you his last words which were that he had seen too much then springing furiously from the top of the rock he precipitated himself into the sea Terrified at the dreadful sight I hastily turned back and travelled hither to bring you the fatal news  Geneura overwhelmed with grief and amazement for the death of her lover and the strange message he had sent her abandoned herself to the most violent excesses of despair she beat her beauteous bosom tore her hair and in the wildness of her woe a thousand times invoked the dear loved name of Ariodant repeated the mysterious words he uttered and as often called on death to end her  The news of his death with the sad manner of it spread grief and consternation through the whole  city even the remotest parts of Scotland felt and lamented the loss of their valiant defender the king and the whole court bewailed his loss with the sincerest sorrow but Lurcanio superior in grief as more nearly interested in the dear deceased mourned his unhappy brother with all the tenderness of fraternal love and all the warmth of friendship  Revolving in his mind the fatal adventure of the window which had been the cause of his brother's distraction the desire and hope of revenge afforded some relief to the poignancy of his woe and obstinately bent to sacrifice the princess to the manes of his Ariodant he presented himself before the king and council and accused her of incontinence relating all that Ariodant and he had seen and the fatal effects it had upon him he then reminded the king of the Scottish laws against unchastity and loudly demanded justice on the princess  Horror and amazement seized the soul of the unhappy father Geneura tho' dearer to him than life tho' innocent in his opinion he has not power to screen from the danger that threatens her the laws indeed permit the accused to have a champion to fight in her defence by whom if the prosecutor who is obliged to maintain by force of arms the truth of his assertion is worsted she is declared guiltless of the crimes laid to her charge  To this only remedy the king has recourse and causes it to be proclaimed throughout his dominions that if any knight of noble birth will undertake the defence of his daughter and by force of  arms shall vanquish her accuser on him he will bestow the princess with a dower suitable to her quality  Notwithstanding this proclamation no knight has yet offered himself for the enterprize deterred therefrom by the known valour of Lurcanio the king no less anxious for Geneura's reputation than her life caused all her maids to be brought to a trial who with one voice declared they never were privy to any intrigue of their royal mistress  Alarmed at these proceedings and dreading the consequence of a further scrutiny I urged the duke to take some measures for our common security he with dissembled kindness praised my secrecy and affection and sent two men to conduct me to a castle of his at a great distance from the court  Wholly relying on his faith I put myself under the protection of those two villains whom the duke desirous of removing for ever the only person who could discover his guilt ordered when they came to a convenient place to murder me happily for me chance conducted you that way you delivered me from my impending fate and while it shall please heaven to preserve my unhappy life it shall be spent in grateful acknowledgments to my protector  This account of Geneura's innocence was extremely welcome to Rinaldo for though confiding in his own courage he was not without hopes of delivering her guilty as she appeared yet the certainty he was going to fight in a just cause animated him with double fires and gave him almost a confirmation of victory  Now clapping spurs to his horse he rode on with such eager haste that the noble town of St Andrews soon appeared in view There the combat was to be performed the guards had already surrounded the lists the challenger's trumpet had sounded and the unhappy king pale trembling and full of eager anxiety listened with a beating heart and fearcheck'd wishes for an accepting answer  Mean time Rinaldo having left the frighted Dalinda at an inn with repeated assurances of gaining her pardon in case he vanquished the princess's accuser advanced towards the citygate here he was met by a young page who informed him that an unknown knight clad all in sable armour was arrived that he had demanded the combat with Lurcanio and declared he would die or free the princess from her ignominious sentence  Rinaldo impatient to unfold the mystery thundered at the citygates which being opened he rode eagerly to the lists there beholding the combatants engaged he forced his way through the press and crying aloud that they should cease the fight demanded an instant audience of the king  The marshals of the field thereupon parted the two champions and Rinaldo was immediately conducted to the king to whom he related the whole story of Polynesso's treachery as he had received it from Dalinda adding that he would prove the truth of it by force of arms and begged that he might be allowed to defy the traitor duke to single combat  The noble form of Rinaldo but chiefly the pleasing purport of his speech gained him absolute  credit with the king Scarce could the raptured parent restrain the wild exultings of his joy of this confirmation of his Geneura's innocence dearer than life or empire was she loved by him and freely would he have sacrificed both to save her honour he hesitated therefore not a moment in permitting the requested combat but ordered duke Polynesso to be called  He by his office of high constable having the ordering of the combat was riding proudly about the field exulting in his successful treason and anticipating in his own mind the ruin of the fair and injured Geneura Ignorant though he was of the design of this summons yet coward guilt suggesting the worst he had to fear with a disordered air and eyes expressive of the various apprehensions that struck his conscious soul he met the reproachful look of his king and the fierce glances of Rinaldo  That noble warrior repeating in a few words the treasons he had been guilty of challenged him to the field Polynesso denied the accusation but accepting the proferred combat because he could not avoid it retired to arm himself while Rinaldo fraught with the pious prayers and blessings of the king entered the lists and ordered his trumpet to sound  At the third blast the duke appeared pale terror and dismay were pictured in his face his fainting heart throbbed with the conscious pangs of guilt and horrors of impending fate confused distracted not knowing what he did he darted forward at the signal given to begin the fight but his  weak lance ill guided by his trembling hand fell harmless to the ground  Not so the great Rinaldo he with calm courage and brave yet unassuming confidence meditated the wound and rising all collected to the blow threw his famed lance with such unerring skill and force that it pierced quite through the armour of Polynesso and hid its fatal point within his side  The traitor fell Rinaldo eagerly dismounted and approaching him unlaced his helmet With faint low voice he called for mercy and thinking to deserve it confessed unasked the wrong he had been guilty of to Geneura then as if life had been only lent him till he had cleared her innocence scarce had he uttered another prayer for mercy but death supprest the coward supplication and he lay a breathless coarse at the feet of Rinaldo  The people transported with joy that their princess was not only delivered from death but restored to her former sanctity of character made the air resound with their acclamations  Rinaldo being conducted to the king untied the beaver of his helmet and was immediately known to be that famous knight of Italy whose noble exploits were noised over all the habitable world  The king embraced him in a rapture of joy and gratitude the nobles crouded round the deliverer of their princess loaded him with blessings and strove to exceed each other in praises of his invincible valour  These congratulations over all eyes were turned upon the unknown knight in black armour who  had so generously undertaken the defence of Geneura against her accuser Lurcanio pensive he stood during the fight between Polynesso and Rinaldo his eyes fixed upon the combatants with eager attention he had listened to the dying words of the treacherous duke and while the multitude in loud shouts expressed their joy and the king and court were paying honours to the glorious victor he stood apart from the throng absorbed in thought and wholly insensible of the tumult around him  The king caused him to be conducted to his presence and acknowledging himself greatly obliged to his generous intention pressed him to let him know in what manner he could repay the obligation  The knight made no answer but bowing low and throwing off his helmet the king and court with the utmost astonishment beheld the lovely face of Ariodant wonder and joy kept them all silent for a while at length the king recovering from his surprize clasp'd the young warrior to his breast with a tender embrace  Is it possible said he in a tone of voice expressive of the strongest transport that I behold again my Ariodant the gallant defender of my dominions and the brave champion for my daughter's honour him whom I lamented as dead whom my whole kingdom mourned for tell me by what strange yet happy chance I now behold thee living whose death was so confidently affirmed and so universally believed  Ariodant knowing the king was acquainted with the whole story of his love replied without reserve  The peasant my lord whom I detained to be a witness of the sad effects of my despair and to bring the news of it to the princess informed her truly that I cast myself from the rock into the sea but that natural repugnance we have all to death when near however we may despise its terrors at a distance impelled me involuntarily to use measures to preserve a life which a moment before I had been so desirous of losing  As soon as I rose again upon the surface of the waves I applied myself to swimming at which I was very expert and soon reached the neighbouring shore faint weary and almost breathless I threw myself down amidst the rushes and was found in this condition by an ancient hermit whose cell was at a small distance  Thither he conducted me and in a few days his charitable cares restored me to my strength but alas my mind was tortured still with various passions love hate despair and eager thirst of vengeance by turns possessed me in vain I sought to banish the idea of Geneura from my soul it still returned with double force nor could her infidelity of which mistaken wretch that I was I thought I had such convincing proofs weaken the power of her resistless charms  Thus languishing with a cureless wound I heard the news of her accusation by my brother and the danger to which her life and honour were exposed at that moment forgetting the injuries  I had suffered insensible to all the ties of consanguinity and friendship and only solicitous for her safety I determined to fight with my brother in her defence pleasing myself with the thought that if I did not free her I should at least have the satisfaction of dying in her cause and thereby proving how much superior to Polynesso was my love who though favoured as he was by her he wanted courage to defend her  Having provided myself with armour that might effectually conceal me I came hither full of fury against my brother whom I could not but consider as my worst enemy since he was the accuser of the still adored Geneura  The arrival of the brave Rinaldo happily prevented the continuance of a combat which must have ended in the death of one brother and eternal remorse to the other  With joy I behold the princess delivered from the ignominious death with which she was threatened but oh with far more rapture do I congratulate your majesty on this discovery of her innocence Happy Rinaldo to be at once the defender of her life and restorer of her honour As for me I sought only to preserve her from death and if that was denied me to have the satisfaction at least of dying in her defence by the hand of a friend and brother  The king who loved him before for his virtues was so charmed with this generous proof of his passion for his daughter that he easily yielded to the solicitations of Rinaldo and the noblemen of his court to bestow the princess on so faithful a  lover and endowing her with the dutchy of Albania which on Polynesso's decease reverted to the crown he gave her hand to Ariodant in the presence of the whole court and the nuptials were soon after celebrated with the utmost magninificence  Rinaldo having obtained Dalinda's pardon who retired into a monastry took leave of the king and happy lovers and pursued his voyage to England  TREATISE ON THE EDUCATION of DAUGHTERS CONTINUED  Of the use of History for Children  CHILDREN are very fond of strange stories it is common to see them in high delight or in tears at the recital of adventures fail not to take advantage of this propensity whenever you find them disposed to listen tell them some short pretty fable and let it be one relative to the animals innocent and ingeniously composed give them for what they are fables and explain the moral design of them  As for the heathen stories it will be happy for a girl to remain totally ignorant of them all her lifetime because they are impure and abound with impious absurdities but if you cannot prevent an acquaintance with some do your endeavour to inspire an abhorrence of them  When you have told one story stay till the child asks for another leaving as it were a craving upon him to be further informed at length when his curiosity becomes excited then have some select  pieces of history to relate in a compendious manner let there be a connection between them and tell a particular part one day and another the next that he may be held in suspence and in impatience to hear the conclusion  Animate your accounts with a lively tone of voice and expression and make the personages speak children of a lively imagination will fancy they both hear and see them for example recite the story of Joseph make the brothers speak like brutish people Jacob like a fond afflicted father Joseph in his character taking pleasure when become the ruler over Egypt in keeping himself from being known by his brethren then putting them in dread of him and at last discovering himself  This natural representation joined to the wonders of the history will charm a child provided he is not cloyed of such things but left to ask for them or be promised them under the notion of reward and when he is grown wiser and provided we never offer them by way of a task nor oblige them to a repetition for this is a force upon him and what will destroy all the pleasure he takes in these historical pieces  However it is to be observed that if he hath any degree of facility in speaking he will be naturally prone to relate to those he loves whatever stories have given him the greatest entertainment but you are not to set him this for a rule you may get some person that is free with him to pretend a desire to hear the story the child will be quite delighted to tell it and do not seem to mind him nor take any notice of his mistakes when he comes  to be better practised then you may with gentleness observe to him what is the best manner of telling a tale to make it short plain and natural by the choice of such circumstances as best set forth things as they truly were If you have a number of children use them by degrees to represent the several personages in the history they have learned let one be Abraham another Isaac c this personating will delight them beyond other plays and give them a habit of thinking and speaking serious matters with pleasure and fix the transactions indelibly in their memory  We ought to endeavour to give them a greater taste for sacred history than for any other not by commending it as the finest which perhaps they would not readily believe but by bringing them to perceive it without a word said Point out to their observation of what importance it is how singular marvellous replete with natural paintings and nobly spiritous the articles of the creation the fall of Adam the deluge the call of Abraham the sacrifice of Isaac the adventures of Joseph abovementioned the birth and flight of Moses are not only proper to awake the curiosity of children but at the same time that they discover the origin of religion they also lay the foundations of it in the young mind  It would argue a profound ignorance of the essence of religon not to see that it is entirely historical for by a web of marvellous facts do we find its establishment its perpetuity and all that ought to engage us to the belief and practice thereof  Let it not be imagined that we have any intention that people should dip into science when we propose these histories to them for they are brief various and proper to please the most ordinary understandings God who best knows the spirit of man whom he created hath thrown religion among popular facts which far from overcharging the simple assist them rather to conceive and retain the sense of its mystery for instance tell a child that in God three coequal persons make but one single nature by hearing and repeating these terms he will remember them but I doubt not conceive the sense of them Tell him then how when Jesus Christ came out of the water of Jordan the Father caused these words to be heard from heaven  This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him  Add that the Holy Spirit descended upon our Saviour in a bodily shape like a dove and you will make him sensibly perceive the Trinity in a passage which he will never forget here are three persons whom he will ever distingush by their different actions you have but to teach him that all taken together constitute but one God  This example suffices to show the use of history which though it seems to be a prolix method of instruction is in reality the most compendious and avoids the dry way of catechisms wherein the mysteries are disjoined from the facts and we may know that in the antient times they taught by means of history The admirable method of teaching which St Austin prescribes was not of that father's introduction it was the universal practice  of the chuch this consisted in demonstrating by a series of historical facts religion to be as old as the world Jesus Christ expected in the old testament Jesus Christ reigning in the new this is the bottom of christian instruction  This requires somewhat more time and application than the method of teaching to which some people confine themselves however by this series of history we are brought to a true knowledge of religion whereas when unacquainted with it we have but confused notions of Jesus Christ the gospel the church and of the foundation of those virtues with which the name of christian ought to inspire us  The historical catechism printed a little while ago a plain book short and much clearer than the common catechisms includes all necessary to be known on that head and of this no one will say that it requires a great deal of study  To the passages I have beforementioned let us add the going thorough the Red Sea the sojournment of the people in the desert where they eat the bread which fell from heaven and drank of the water which Moses by the stroke of his rod made to spring out of the rock  Represent to them the miraculous conquest of the promised land on which occasion the waters of Jordan turned back toward their source and the walls of a city fell down of themselves in the view of the besiegers Paint in natural colours the conflicts of Saul and of David shew the last while yet a stripling without arms and in his dress of a shepherd the vanquisher of that  proud giant Goliah Let not be forgotten the glory and wisdom of Solomon his decision of the dispute between the two women about the child but then describe him fallen from that height of wisdom dishonouring himself by ease and indulgence the almost unavoidable consequence of extreme prosperity  Make the prophets speak to the king in the name of the Lord let them read futurity as a volume appear humble of austere life and suffering continual persecution for the truth's sake  Place in its due point of time the first destruction of Jerusalem describe the temple burned and the holy city ruined for the sins of the people relate the captivity in Babylon where the Jews bewailed their beloved Sion before their return bring in the pleasing relations of what befel Tobit Judith Esther and Daniel  It would have its usefulness if children were brought to declare their thoughts on the different characters of these Saints to know which affected them most one would prefer Esther another Judith this would create a little contention and so more strongly impress the stories upon their minds and help to form their judgment  After this bring the people up to Jerusalem and let them repair the ruins thereof then form a lovely picture of the peace and prosperity of the city in a short time after give the portrait of that cruel and impious Antiochus who died in hypocritical penitence  Describe the victories of the Maccabees under the reign of that persecutor likewise the martyrdom  of the seven brethren of the same family Proceed to the miraculous birth of John the Baptist then in course recount that of Jesus Christ after which it will be proper to select out of the gospels all the most striking passages of his life his preaching at the Temple at years of age his baptism his retreat into the wilderness and temptation his calling his Apostles the miracle of the loaves the conversion of that woman sinner that anointed his feet with precious unguent washed them with her tears and dried them with her hair  Tell how he taught the Samaritan woman how cured the man born blind raised Lazarus from the dead shew Jesus Christ entering triumphant into Jerusalem shew him upon the cross and at length rising out of the SepulchreAfter this it should be remarked with how much familiarity he consorted with his Disciples for forty days together even till they beheld him ascend up into Heaven besides this the descent of the Holy Ghost the stoning of St Stephen the conversion of Paul the calling of the centurion Cornelius the travels of the apostles and particularly of St Paul are exceedingly engaging chuse out the most wonderful stories of the martyrs and something in general of the heavenly life of the primitive Christians interspersed with instances of the courage of young virgins the astonishing austerities of the hermits the conversion of the emperors and of the empire the blindness of the Jews and their terrible punishment which lasteth to this day  These narrations will in a delightful manner impress on the tender and lively imagination of a child an entire series of religion from the creation of the world to our days give them noble ideas of it and such as will never be effaced they will perceive likewise in that history the hand of God ever lifted up to deliver the righteous and to confound the wicked  They will be used to see God the efficient cause in all things drawing interceptibly into his designs those of his creatures that seem most repugnant to them  But as to this collection of extracts let it consist of such as afford the pleasantest the most magnificent images for we should by all means so manage it that children may find religion charming lovely venerable whereas their common notion of it is as of something melancholy flat and doleful  Besides the inestimable benefit of thus teaching them religion all these delightful narrations so early infused into their memories awaken a curiosity to be informed of things in their nature serious render them sensible to the pleasures of the understanding and interest them in whatever parts of history happen to bear any relation to such as they have already learned  Yet I say again great care must be taken never to lay it down for a rule that they must attend to you must remember all much more never to prescribe stated lessons no let pleasure effect every thing  Do not urge them and you will bring it to bear even for ordinary understandings the point is not to overcharge them but wait the gradual rise of their curiosity  But it will be objectedto relate these several parts of history in a lively concise natural and pleasing manner where are the governesses capable of it To which I answer that in proposing it I mean that people should endeavour to procure for their children persons of good parts and put them as much as possible into this method of teaching and so every governess will perform according to her talent but still whatever her capacity is matters will not go quite so wrong when this natural and plain method is in practice  To their narrations they may add the sight of prints or pictures representing the sacred stories prints will serve for general use But if there should be an opportunity of shewing the children good pictures let it not be neglected for the glow of colours and size of figures as big as the life strike the imagination with much greater force  THE LADY's GEOGRAPHY  DESCRIPTION of the Island of CEYLON Continued from Page  ALL the kinds of fruits which the Indies in general produce are found in this island it has however some peculiar to itself among which one of the most particular is the Jacks a fruit which is of very great service in food it grows on a very high tree is of a greenish colour covered over with prickles and is about the size of a loaf of eighteen pounds weight Its seeds or what they call its eggs are disposed in the inside of it like the seeds of a gourd They eat the jacks as we eat cabbage and its taste is not extremely unlike it When it is ripe it may be eaten raw and one of them is sufficient for six or seven people The grain or eggs resemble chesnuts very much both in colour and taste they may be eaten either boiled or roasted in ashes one jacks produces two or three quarts of them and the inhabitants always keep store of them by them  The Jombs is another fruit which is peculiar to the island it has the taste of an apple is very full of juice and is no less wholesome than agreeable Its colour is white mixed with red in a manner that appears to be the work of an elegant pencil There are also several wild fruits  which are to be met with in their woods as the Mucroes which are round of the size of a cherry and of a very agreeable taste The Dongs which resemble black cherries the Ambellos which may be compared to our gooseberries the Carollas Cabellas Tookes and Jollas which may pass for so many sorts of very good plumbs and the Paragiddes which are not unlike our pears  The island of Ceylon produces three trees which though their fruits are not indeed fit to eat are no less remarkable for other conveniencies the first which is named Tallipot is very strait and in heighth and thickness nearly resembles the mast of a ship its leaves are so large that a single one will cover fifteen or twenty men and shelter them from the rain They grow stronger as they dry without becoming less pliable or manageable Nature could scarcely have bestowed any gift on the inhabitants more valueable than this although the leaves are so very extensive when open they can be folded up like a fan and being then not thicker than one's arm weigh very little in the hand Their shape is round but the Ceylonese cut them into triangular pieces wherewith they cover themselves when they travel taking care to place the pointed end before them which therefore makes its way the easier through the shrubs The soldiers make tents of them  These leaves grow at the top of the tree like those of the cocoa but what is very extraordinary it bears no fruit till the year of its death at which time alone it puts forth large branches  laden with very beautiful yellow flowers but of a very strong and offensive smell which changes into a round hard fruit of the size of our largest cherries but which are good for nothing but to sow Thus the Tillipot bears but once but then it is so loaded with fruit at that time that one tree is sufficient for the sowing of a whole province Yet the smell of the flowers is so insufferable near houses that they seldom fail to cut down the tree so soon as it begins to put forth buds especially as at that time if they are cut there is found within them an exceeding good sap which may be reduced to meal and made up in cakes that have the taste of white bread This is also another resource for the inhabitants when the rice harvest happens to turn out indifferently  The second of these trees is the Kitula which grows as strait as the cocoa but not so tall and by many degrees slenderer Its principal singularity consists in its yielding a kind of liquor which is called Tellegie very sweet wholesome and agreeable but without any strength The liquor they collect twice aday and from some of the best trees three times the quantity of the whole frequently amounting to six quarts in a day They boil it up till it acquires the consistence and appearance of dark powder sugar and this the inhabitants call Jaggory With very little more trouble they might render it as white as sugar to which in every other respect it is no way inferior in goodness The manner of getting this liquor is as follows  When the tree comes to its maturity it puts  forth towards its extremities a little button which changes into a round fruit and is properly speaking the seed This button they open putting into it various ingredients such as salt pepper citron garlic and various kinds of leaves which prevent it from ripening so soon as it would otherwise do Every day at certain times they cut off a little piece towards the end of this from which place the liquor flows out in abundance As this button ripens and withers others grow lower and lower every year till they at length reach the bottom of the branches but when this comes to be the case which is in about eight or ten years the tree ceases to bear and presently after dies  Its leaves resemble those of the cocoapalm and are covered with a kind of bark extremely hard and full of filaments which are employed in the making of ropes they fall during the whole time that the tree is growing but when it has arrived at its full dimensions they remain on it for many years and when they do fall are never supplied by any others  The wood which is seldom above three inches thick serves as a velopement to a very thick pith it is extremely hard and heavy but very apt to split of itself The colour of it is black and looks as if it was composed of inlaid work The Ceylonese make pestles of it to beat the rice withal  The third extraordinary tree and indeed what renders this island so extremely valuable to the Dutch is that which bears the cinnamon it is  called in the language of the country Corundagouhah It grows in the woods indiscriminately with other trees and what is somewhat extraordinary the Ceylonese set no extraordinary value upon it This tree is of a middling bulk its bark is the cinnamon which appears white when on the trunk but which they take off and dry it in the sun The islanders gather this only from the smaller trees although the bark of the larger ones smell as sweet and have as strong a taste The wood has no smell it is white and about the hardness of deal and is used for all kinds of purposes Its leaf is not unlike that of the laurel but when it first begins to put forth is of a bright scarlet and rubbed between the hands has more the smell of a clove gillyflower than that of the cinnamon The fruit which usually ripens about September is like an acorn but smaller and has less both of smell and taste than the bark They boil them in water in order to extract an oil from them which swims at the top and when congealed becomes as hard and as white as tallow and of a very agreeable smell The inhabitants anoint their bodies with it and also burn it in their lamps but no candles are made of it but for the King  With respect to animals the island of Ceylon produces a great variety viz cows buffaloes swine goats deer hares dogs jackalls apes tygers bears wild bears elephants lions horses and asses but no sheep Amongst the fallow beasts they have one called the Memima which is no bigger than a hare but much resembles a  deer its colour is grey spotted with white and its flesh is excellent The Ganvera is a kind of wild buck which has a very sharp chine its four feet white and half the legs of the same colour Knox gives an account of his having seen one which was kept in the king's magazine together with a black tyger a white deer and a spotted elephant  The apes are not only in prodigious abundance in the woods but also of many various kinds whereof there are some very different from any that are to be found in other countries Some of them are as large as our spaniels with grey hair and black faces and long white beards reaching from ear to ear which give them greatly the appearance of old men There are others of the same size but differing in colour their bodies faces and beards being all of a bright white But as this difference of colour does not seem to form any specific difference in the animal they are both alike named Wanderous they do but little mischief keeping constantly in the woods where they feed entirely on leaves and buds  There is another sort called Killowan which are beardless but have a white face and long hair on their heads which descend and divide like those of the human species this kind are extremely mischievous from the continual ravage they commit amongst the grain The Ceylonese are extremely fond of the flesh of all their kinds of apes as well as of that of their squirrels whereof they have also several different species  The variety of ants in the island of Ceylon is  no less admirable than their abundance That which they call Coumbias and TaleCoumbias are very much like ours in size with this difference that the first are reddish and the others which are black are only to be found in rotten trees and have a very disagreeable smell  There is a third kind called Dimbios which are large and red and make their nests on the branches of large trees in leaves which they amass together to the bulk of a man's head Several nests are sometimes found on one tree and the fear of a thousand dangerous things will then prevent any person from attempting to climb up it  The Coura  atches are a fourth kind of ants they are large and black live under ground and form holes there nearly of the shape of rabbitburrows and the fields are so full of these holes that the cattle are in perpetual danger from them of breaking their legs  A fifth sort are the Codd as they are of a very fine black much about the size of the former and live also in the earth but they frequently make excursions in very numerous parties without any one knowing the peculiar period of their expedition They bite cruelly if hurt or put out of their way but otherwise if unmolested they are very harmless and inoffensive  But the most numerous and at the same time the most extraordinary of all the kinds of ants is that which they call the Vacos The ground is covered with them they are of a middling size have a white body and red head and devour every thing that comes in their way They eat  cloth wood the straw wherewith the houses are thatched and in short every thing but iron and stone No one dares to leave any thing in an uninhabited house they get up along the walls making a rhind of earth as they go along which they continue through the whole extent of their way to what height soever they arrive If this arcade happens to break they all immediately return back again to repair their building and continue their march assoon as they have completed the work The inhabitants easily perceive their approach by the sight of these little vaults and are obliged to use continual precaution to destroy or drive them away In places which are without houses they raise up little mountains of earth of four five or six feet in height and so strong that it is not easy to destroy them even with a spade These little huts which are called Humbosses are composed of vaults or arcades and built of very fine earth which the people make use of for the fabrication of their idols  The Vacos multiply prodigiously but they also die by myriads for when they acquire their wings they take their flight in such inconceivable numbers towards the west that they almost obscure the sky and rising to so great a height as to be quite lost to the view they cease not their flight till they drop down dead exhausted with fatigue they then become a prey to birds of many kinds and chickens in particular will feed on them more readily than on even the rice  To be continued  THE LADY's MUSEUM  The TRIFLER NUMBER XI  To the AUTHOR of the TRIFLER  MADAM  _MY brother who is a great scholar and writes A M after his name desires me to acquaint you that having with much labour and pains translated the enclosed dialogue from the Greek he is willing to communicate it to the world in your paper that the trifling part of your readers which he supposes to be by far the greater number may learn that there were trifling that is idle people in the time of Socrates and may be corrected by the wise admonitions of that  great divine My brother is determined to keep himself concealed that he may silently and without envy enjoy the reputation of this performance and therefore recommends it to you to be particularly careful that no mistakes are made in the spelling and pointing  I am your humble servant UNKNOWN  P S My brother says Socrates was not a divine but a philosopher  A DIALOGUE BETWEEN SOCRATES and ARISTARCHUS  SOCRATES one day observing Aristarchus to look thoughtful and melancholy said to him  My friend something seems to lie heavy upon your mind you should share the burden with your friends perhaps we may be able to assist you  To which Aristarchus replied  Indeed Socrates I am in great perplexity You know that on account of the war a great multitude have forsaken the open country and fled into the Piraeum and there are come to my house so many helpless sisters nieces and cousins that I have not less than fourteen gentlewomen Now from our landed estates we get nothing for the enemy is master there nor from rent of houses inhabitants are so thin in the city furniture no body will buy and money there is none to be borrowed one may as soon expect to find it in walking along the streets as to borrow anyIt is grievous Socrates to stand and see our relations perish it is impossible to  support such a number of them in such times  Socrates hearing all this replied  And how comes it to pass that Reramo who has a great family to maintain not only finds means to provide himself and them with all necessaries but likewise has so much to spare that he even grows rich by what he vends  Good reason replied the other because he keeps slaves and I gentlefolks  And of these two sorts of people which may you reckon the most valuable his slaves or your gentlefolks  said Socrates  "Surely mine" says Aristarchus  But then is it not a disgrace says the philosopher that while he is thriving by the means of a parcel of slaves you should be driven to extremity with those that are so much their betters  Oh but says the other he feeds handicraftsmen I people who have been genteelly brought up  I suppose you mean by handicraftsmen replied Socrates those who are skilled in preparing the useful things of life  "Yes I do" said the other  "Is meal in that number"  "Undoubtedly"  "And bread"  "Most surely"  And cloaths for both sexes coats gowns cloaks linen  A  questionless these are all most useful  Probably continued Socrates your people are not at all skilled in making any of these things  "O yes one or other in all or most of them"  Possibly then said Socrates you don't know that by means of one single article Nausicydes the mealman not only maintains himself and several servants but likewise a great number of hogs and cows and hath so thriven as even to be named for serving the expensive offices of the state and that Kerybus by his business of a baker supports a large family nay lives in plenty then there's Demeas the taylor and numbers of Megareans that get a fine livelihood by mercery ware  Defend me says the other these fellows are owners of many purchased slaves whom they force to work and by their labours they thrive but I tell you I have none but gentry and my relations  Pray now because they are gentry and your relations says Socrates do you think they have nothing to do but to eat and sleep or among people of the like condition do you reckon those that live after that manner to pass their time more happily than others that both know and practise the necessary employments of life or do you apprehend sloth and idleness to be more conducive towards a man's learning what he ought to understand or remembering what he has learned or to his health and strength of body or in fine toward his attaining or preserving the requisites of life while industry and care  are nothing worth You confess they have been taught to do some of these workswhybecause they were things of no service or such as they must never put their hands to or rather on the contrary as what they might one day labour in and profit byfor which makes men the most virtuousliving in idleness or being engaged in a useful businessor honestest the being employed or lazily to be talking how they shall live Yet more it is my opinion that neither you love them nor they younot them for you really feel them very burthensome to you they love not you for they must see you are quite weary of themfrom whence 'tis a great chance but dislike and enmity will spring up more and more while kindred and affection fades away Now could you contrive to make yourself their director and protector in some kind of profitable employment you would then be fond of them finding them useful to you and they would love you because they would perceive you had pleasure in what they did and then reflecting with satisfaction on all former benefits the obligation to them would be enhanced and you would grow friendlier and dearer to each other every day  If any thing scandalous was proposed to be done death is rather to be chosen but now these women know to perform what is very laudable very becoming their sexand whatever we know how to do that we do with  the greatest facility and pleasure Wherefore make no hesitation to press them to what will be of service to yourself and them and it is my opinion they will with pleasure agree to the proposal  By all the gods said Aristarchus you give me such admirable advice Socrates that I who lately dared not think of borrowing being sure that when that money was gone I should never be able to discharge the debt am now resolved to venture upon it to begin our undertaking  Accordingly money was raised a quantity of wool laid in the women worked even while they eat their dinner they worked till supper time sorrow was turned into joy instead of sour glances they looked with chearfulness on each other they loved him as their guardian he them as a set of useful relations  Some time after he came again to Socrates and with pleasure in his face gave him an account of their proceedings and added  They now accuse me as the only person that eats idle bread in the house  Well says Socrates and don't you tell them the fable of the dog Upon a time when animals could speak a sheep talked to her master in this manner 'We are vastly surprised that to us who afford you wool and lamb and cheese you never allow any other food but merely what the earth produces whereas your dog by whom you get nothing comes in for a snap of every sort of victuals you eat yourself' The dog overhearing this cries 'Aye but 'tis to me you owe your safety that you are neither stole  by the rogues nor devoured by the wolves was not I to watch over you ye durst not go to pasture for your lives' this convinced the sheep of the dog's merit Tell them therefore that you like the dog are their guardian and careful overseer by whose means they live to follow their employments with pleasure and safety  THE HISTORY OF HARRIOT and SOPHIA CONCLUDED  SOPHIA was not deceived when she imagined she had seen Sir Charles it was really he who had rode by her window and it was her little abode he was in search of though in his extreme eagerness he had overlooked it  He had left England with a hope that change of scene and a variety of new objects would efface the idea of Sophia from his heart and restore him to his former tranquility but amidst all the delights of Paris he found himself opprest with languor no amusements could entertain him no conversation engage his attention disgusted with every thing he saw and heard peevish discontented and weary of the world he avoided all company and had recourse to books for relief but Sophia was too much in his thoughts to render study either instructive or amusing He past whole days in solitude feeding his melancholy with the reflection of a thousand past circumstances  which served to soften his mind and make him feel his loss more sensibly  When he reflected on her exalted virtues her wit her elegance the attractive graces of her person and the irresistable sweetness of her manners he lamented his hard fate that had put such a treasure out of his reach but when his conscience told him that it had once been in his power to have become possessor of this treasure that he had trifled with that innocent affection till he had alienated it from himself to another object his anguish became insupportable and he sought to relieve it by rousing his indignation against her for her preference of so unworthy a rival  He called to mind her interview with this happy rival in the field and concluded he was far more favoured by her than himself had ever been since her discourse to him had produced so tender and passionate an expression of acknowledgment as that he had beheld  These circumstances which his imagination dwelt upon in order to lessen his regret added to it all the stings of jealousy so that almost frantic with rage and grief he was a hundred times upon the point of committing some desperate action  A violent fever was the consequence of these transports which after confining him a long time to his bed left his body in a weak and languishing condition and his mind sunk in an habitual melancholy  His physicians recommended to him the air of Montpelier and he was preparing to set out for  that place when he happened to meet with a gentleman who made him alter his resolution  This person had been his governor and now attended Mr Howard in the same quality  Sir Charles who had a slight acquaintance with Mrs Howard was prevailed upon notwithstanding his aversion to company to receive a visit from her son he invited the young gentleman to dine with him and he having not yet forgot the lovely Sophia drank her health after dinner by the name of miss Darnley  Sir Charles who could not hear that name without a visible emotion told him he knew two young ladies so called and asked whether it was the eldest or the youngest sister that he meant  Mr Howard replied  That he was ignorant till then that miss Darnley had a sister  Yes she has a sister said his governor who is much handsomer than herself and for whom a youthful passion would be far more excusable  The young gentleman who knew his governor talked in that contemptuous manner of Sophia in compliance with his mother's humour in revenge avowed his admiration of her in the most passionate terms and forgetting that Sir Charles had said he was acquainted with her described her excellencies with all the enthusiasm of a lover  Sir Charles listened in silence and when the other had done speaking told him with an air of forced gravity that it was easy to see he was very much in love  This indeed was his real opinion nevertheless he felt no emotions of jealousy or resentment  against a rival whom he believed was as unhappy as himself he asked him with a seeming carelessness if miss Sophia was not to be married to the son of a rich farmer in the village where she lived and waited his answer with an agitation of mind which appeared so plainly in the frequent changes of his colour that Mr Howard must have observed it had not the question given him almost as much concern  After a short pause he replied  That he never heard she was going to be married  but added he sighing  I remember I have seen a very handsome young man at Mr Lawson's who perhaps  Aye aye interrupted his governor smiling he was the favoured lover no doubt you have nothing to do but to forget her as soon as you can  The youth sat pensive and silent for some time then suddenly rising took leave of Sir Charles and went away his governor prepared to follow him but the baronet anxious to hear more of Sophia detained him to ask several questions concerning her acquaintance with Mr Howard  Sir Charles found his old friend had lost no part of his former candor and sincerity though by the trust reposed in him he was obliged to discountenance as much as possible the passion of his pupil for a young woman so much his inferior in rank and fortune yet having seen and conversed with Sophia he did justice to her extraordinary merit and acknowledged that Mrs Howard had treated her harshly  He related to Sir Charles in what manner Mrs Howard had invited her to her house and the suspicions she entertained of Sophia's encouraging her son's passion and design to ensnare him into a clandestine marriage  Suspicions added he which her subsequent behaviour entirely destroyed for the youth was rash enough to avow his passion openly and solicited her by frequent letters and messages to grant him an interview which she absolutely refused and this conduct did her honour and procured her great esteem yet it is very likely that her affections are otherwise engaged and that she has some difficulties to encounter for she looks thoughtful and melancholy and affects retirement more than persons of her age generally do  Sir Charles was thrown into so profound a reverie by this account of Sophia that he heard not a word of what his friend afterwards said which had no relation to this interesting subject and scarce perceived when he went away  After reflecting a long time with mingled grief resentment and compassion upon her melancholy which he supposed was occasioned by some disappointment in the affair of her marriage with the young farmer and which probably her want of fortune was the cause of he suddenly formed the generous design of removing this obstacle to her union with the person whom she preferred to him and by making her happy entitle himself to her esteem since he had unfortunately lost her heart  The novelty of this resolution and its extraordinary generosity filled him with so many selfflattering ideas as suspended for a while his jealousy and his grief  Instead of going to Montpelier he set out immediately for England and during his journey was continually applauding himself for the uncommon disinterestedness of his conduct  Nothing is more certain than that the motives even of our best actions will not always bear examination we deceive ourselves first and our vanity is too much interested in the deception to make us wish to detect it Sir Charles either did not or would not perceive the latent hope that lurked within his bosom and which perhaps suggested the designs he had formed  How must such an instance of generous passion thought he affect a mind so delicately sensible as Sophia's she who had once loved him and what was more than probable had not yet entirely forgot him  He never asked himself why his imagination dwelt upon these pleasing images why he prosecuted his journey with such eager haste as if the purport of it was to receive not to resign for ever the woman he so passionately loved  When he arrived at his own house scarce would he allow himself a few minutes rest after his fatiguing journey he hastened to Mr Herbert's lodgings to prevail upon him to justify by his concurrence the designs he had formed in favour of Sophia  Mean time the secret and powerful impulse by which he was actuated kept his mind in a continual tumult He hoped he feared he wished he was all anxious expectation all trembling doubt he heard with grief that Mr Herbert was at Bath for now he knew not how to get access to Sophia who being ignorant of his intentions and offended by his behaviour might possibly refuse to see him  He went to the house where Mrs Darnley lived when he left England he was surprised to see it shut up This incident perplexed him more and rendered him more impatient  He returned to his house ordered his horses to be saddled and set out immediately for Mr Lawson's where he arrived before he had resolved how to introduce himself or who he should enquire for  However upon the appearance of a servant at the door he asked for Mr Herbert which Mr Lawson hearing came out himself and though he did not know Sir Charles politely requested him to alight telling him he had just received a letter from Mr Herbert which acquainted him that he was perfectly recovered and that he was on the way to London  Sir Charles accepted Mr Lawson's invitation and alighting followed him into a parlour but in such perturbation of mind that he scarce knew what he did The good curate surprised at the pensiveness and silence of his guest was at a loss what to say to him or how to entertain him he gave him an account of Mr Herbert's illness  which seemed to engage his attention very little but happening to mention Sophia in the course of his relation the young baronet started as from a dream and turned his eyes upon him with a look of eagerness and anxiety but said not a word  Mr Lawson paused as expecting he was going to ask him a question which Sir Charles perceiving said with some confusion  I beg your pardon Sir you mentioned miss Sophia I have the honour to know her pray how does me do  I hope she is well Sir replied Mr Lawson I have not seen her a long time  "Then she does not board with you now" said Sir Charles with a countenance as pale as death dreading to hear something still more fatal  As Mr Lawson was going to answer him William not knowing his fatherinlaw had company entered the room abruptly but seeing the baronet he bowed apologized for his intrusion and instantly retired  The various emotions with which this sudden and unexpected sight of his rival filled the breast of Sir Charles caused such a wildness in his looks that Mr Lawson in great astonishment and perplexity asked him if he was taken ill  Sir Charles endeavouring to compose himself replied "That he was very well but in a faultering accent asked who the young gentleman was that had just left the room  Mr Lawson told him he was his soninlaw  Your soninlaw cried Sir Charles eagerly what married to your daughter is it possible  Mr Lawson knew enough of Sophia's story to make him comprehend now who this young gentleman was who discovered so extraordinary a concern upon this occasion and charmed to have an opportunity of doing her service by removing those suspicions which he had been told had produced so fatal a reverse in her fortune he gave the baronet a circumstantial account of his daughter's marriage sensible that he was too much interested in this detail to make him think it impertinent he introduced it no otherways than by declaring himself under the greatest obligation to miss Sophia who having honoured his daughter with her friendship had been the chief instrument of her present happiness  While the good curate related all the circumstances of an affair which had had such melancholy consequences the baronet listened to him with an attention still as the grave his eyes were fixed upon his with a look of the most eager anxiety and he scarce suffered himself to breathe for fear of losing any of his words  In proportion as his doubts were removed his countenance expressed more and more joy and when upon his reflecting on all that he had heard it appeared plainly that the fatal meeting which had caused him so much anguish was the effect of Sophia's solicitude to serve her friend and that the passionate action of the youth was an acknowledgment of gratitude not an expression of love he was not able to conceal the excess of his joy  but rising up in a sudden transport he took the curate's hand and pressing it eagerly  You know not said he Mr Lawson how happy you have made me but where is miss Sophia is she gone to Bath with her good friend Mr Herbert  No Sir replied Mr Lawson she lives with her mother You know I suppose that Mrs Darnley has lost her annuity by the death of the gentleman upon whom it was charged  I never heard it till now said the baronet whose tenderness was alarmed for his Sophia tell me I beg you what is her present situation  Her eldest daughter has left her said Mr Lawson and she has retired with miss Sophia to a village about five miles from hence in the road to London where that excellent young lady supports her mother and herself by the labour of her hands  "Angelick creature" exclaimed Sir Charles with his eyes swimming in tears Then after a little pause he desired a direction to the place where Mrs Darnley lived and took a kind leave of Mr Lawson telling him he hoped soon to visit him again  Sir Charles although he galloped as fast as it was possible found his horse went too slow for his impatience so eager was he to see Sophia and gain her pardon for the unreasonable conduct which his jealousy and rage had made him guilty of  The account Mr Lawson had given him of the part she had taken in his daughter's marriage with the youth whom he had considered as his rival not  only removed the torturing pangs of jealousy which he had so long felt but made him view several circumstances in Sophia's behaviour in a light favourable to his own ardent wishes  He fondly fancied that the melancholy in which he had heard she was plunged was occasioned by a tender remembrance of him and that the hope of still being his might have been the chief cause of her rejecting the addresses of Mr Howard  How different were these ideas from the gloomy ones which had hitherto perplexed his mind he seemed like a man waked from a frightful dream of despair and death to a certainty of life and joy  Amidst these transporting reveries he had passed by Sophia's house without perceiving it to be the same he had been directed to and when he had reached the end of the village he looked about for it in vain and saw no one of whom he could enquire for it but an old woman who was sitting under a tree near the road making up a nosegay of some flowers such as the late season produced  He stopped his horse and asked her if she knew where Mrs Darnley lived At the mention of that name she rose as hastily as her feebleness would permit her and told him she knew the house very well and if he pleased would go and shew it him  I am making this nosegay for the sweet young gentlewoman her daughter said the old woman I carry her flowers every day heaven bless her she is my only support  There is a great many fine folks hereabouts from whom I could never get any relief but since she came hither I have wanted for nothing Pray let me shew you her house old and weak as I am I would walk ten miles to do her service  Sir Charles alighting from his horse ordered his servant to lead it to the nearest public house and wait for him there he told the old woman he would accept of her offer and walk along with her Then taking two guineas out of his pocket he gave them to her in reward he said for the gratitude she expressed for her young benefactress  The good woman received his bounty with a transport of surprise and joy and pleasingly repaid him by talking of his beloved Sophia of whom she related many instances of tenderness and charity towards the poor of the village and filled him with admiration of that true benevolence which even in the midst of indigence could administer to the greater wants of her fellowcreatures  When they came within sight of Sophia's little cottage the old woman pointing to it told him Mrs Darnley and her daughter lived there upon which the baronet dismissing her walked up to it with disordered haste A row of wooden pales led to a small grassplat before the door  As he approached he saw Sophia sitting at a window at work He stopped to gaze upon her she appeared to him more lovely more engaging than ever He wished yet dreaded her looking up lest her first thoughts upon seeing him being  unfavourable she should resolve to refuse his visit He went forwards with a beating heart and cautiously opening the little gate reached the door of this humble habitation unheard and unseen by Sophia the door flew open at his touch poverty has no need of bolts and bars and every good angel is the guard of innocence and virtue  The noise he made in entering and the sound of her name pronounced in a tender accent made Sophia hastily turn her head At sight of Sir Charles she started from her chair her work fell from her trembling hands she looked at him in silent astonishment unable and perhaps unwilling to avoid him  The baronet whose heart laboured with the strongest emotions of tenderness anxiety hope and fear had not power to utter a word and while her surprise kept her motionless threw himself at her feet and taking one of her hands pressed it respectfully to his lips tears at the same time falling from his eyes  Sophia whose gentle mind was sensibly affected with this action and the paleness and langour which appeared in his countenance found it impossible to treat him with that severity which his capricious conduct seemed to demand of her nevertheless she drew away her hand which he yielded with reluctant submission  "I hoped" said she in an accent that expressed more softness and grief than anger or disdain  that I should be spared any farther insults of this sort from you those I have already suffered  has sufficiently punished me for my weak credulity  Sir Charles when she began to speak rose up but continued gazing on her with the most passionate tenderness while every word she uttered seemed to pierce his heart  I will not pursued Sophia gathering firmness as she spoke ask you why you have intruded upon me thus unexpectedly or why you assume a behaviour so little of apiece with your past actions I only beg you to believe that I am not again to be deceived and although I am persuaded my good opinion is of no consequence to you yet I will tell you that if it is possible to regain it it will be by never more importuning me with visits which my situation in life makes it very improper for me to admit of  Sophia when she had said this went out of the room without casting a look back upon Sir Charles who followed her in great disorder conjuring her only to hear what he had to say  As she was passing to her own chamber she was met by her mother who seeing Sir Charles was filled with surprize and joy and perceiving that Sophia was avoiding him said to her with an angry accent  Where are you going what is the meaning of this rudeness  Sophia without answering her retired to her own room not without great perturbation of mind for there was something in the baronet's looks and words that seemed to merit a hearing at least but she dreaded the weakness of her own heart  and was fully persuaded that any condescension on her side would give him too great an advantage over her  Mrs Darnley finding her endeavours to retain her were fruitless advanced towards Sir Charles with great obsequiousness congratulated him upon his return and thanked him for the honour he did her in visiting her in her poor little habitation  Sir Charles saluted her respectfully and took a seat  There is a sad alteration Sir said she in my poor affairs since I saw you last I never thought to have received you in such a hovel You have heard I suppose of my misfortune  Sir Charles who was in great confusion of thought and had scarce heard a word she said replied carelessly  Yes madam I am sorry for it  The coldness of this answer cast a damp upon those hopes which she had eagerly admitted upon seeing him again and impatient to be relieved from her tormenting anxiety on account of this unexpected visit she asked him abruptly whether she might wish him joy for she heard she said that he was going to be married  Sir Charles rouzed by this question replied hastily  Who could have told you any thing so unlikely Married no madam there never was any foundation for such a report  "Indeed I believe so" said Mrs Darnley almost breathless with joy to find him deny it  so earnestly  To be sure people are very envious and illnatured and those who told me no doubt designed to do you an ill office  And they have succeeded said Sir Charles sighing if they have been able to persuade miss Sophia that after having aspired to the possession of her I could descend to love any other woman I came to implore her pardon madam pursued he for all the extravagancies of my past conduct and for that unreasonable jealousy which was the source of them could I have been so happy to have prevailed upon her to have heard me  "What" interrupted Mrs Darnley eagerly  and was my daughter so rude as to leave you without hearing what you had to say I protest I am ashamed of her behaviour but I hope you will be so good to excuse it Sir I will insist upon her coming in again  No madam said Sir Charles holding her for she was hurrying away miss Sophia must not be constrained I cannot bear that  Mrs Darnley unwillingly resumed her seat and inly fretting at her daughter's obstinacy trembled for the event of this visit  Sir Charles after a silence of some minutes suddenly rose up and took his leave Mrs Darnley in great anxiety followed him to the door and said she hoped to see him again He answered only by a low bow and walked away full of doubt and perplexity  Sophia's steadiness in refusing to hear him banished all those flattering ideas of her tenderness for him which he had so eagerly admitted for he concluded that if her heart had not been steeled by indifference she would notwithstanding her just reasons for resentment have been rejoiced to give him an opportunity of justifying himself  He had reached the house where his servant was attending with the horses without having determined what to do To return to town without seeing Sophia again and being assured of a reconciliation was misery which he could not support and he dreaded making a new attempt to see her lest he should receive more proofs of her insensibility and disdain  In this perplexity the sight of Mr Herbert alighting from a stagecoach was a relief as great as it was unexpected and in the sudden joy he felt at meeting with a man whose interposition could be so useful to him he forgot that his former behaviour must necessarily have given rise to strong prejudices against him and ran up to embrace the good old man with extreme cordiality  Mr Herbert was surprised and repaid his civilities with great coldness upon which the young baronet in some confusion desired to have a few moments conversation with him  They walked together down a meadow and Sir Charles having with a candor and sincerity becoming the rectitude of his intentions related all those circumstances which had concurred to excite  his jealousy and with that powerful eloquence which passion inspires expatiated upon the motives of his conduct a conduct which he acknowledged laid him open to the most unfavourable suspicions Mr Herbert convinced of his sincerity and full of compassion for the torments which his mistaken jealousy had caused him undertook to make his peace with Sophia and assured him he would very shortly wait upon him in town  This would not satisfy the anxious lover he declared he would not leave the place till he was assured of his pardon and Mr Herbert who certainly was not displeased with his obstinacy could with difficulty persuade him to wait only till the next day for an account of his success  Sir Charles unwillingly took the road to London and Mr Herbert hastened to congratulate his beloved charge upon the agreeable prospect that was once more opening for her  Mrs Darnley had during this interval been employed in reproaching poor Sophia for her behaviour to Sir Charles In the vexation of her heart she exclaimed in the severest terms against her pride and obstinacy she told her she might be assured Sir Charles would never attempt to see her again that it was plain he was disgusted with her bad temper  She burst into a passion of tears while she enumerated the glorious advantages of that rank and fortune which she said Sophia had thrown from her and among many motives which she urged ought to have determined her to act otherwise  that of being able to outshine her sister was one  Sophia answered only by sighs she herself was not absolutely satisfied with the unrelenting severity with which she had treated Sir Charles The more she reflected upon his behaviour the more she condemned herself for not hearing what he had to offer in his own defence She had once thought it probable that he had been deceived by the report that was spread through Mrs Gibbons's folly of her encouraging the addresses of her nephew and his extravagant conduct might be occasioned by jealousy a fault which a woman is always disposed to pardon in a lover While she revolved these thoughts in her mind Mrs Darnley perceived her uneasiness and added to it by new reproaches  Mr Herbert's arrival put an end to this tormenting scene Sophia first heard his voice and flew to receive him Mrs Darnley followed and seeing her bathed in tears while the good old man saluted her with the tenderness of a parent she told him with an air half serious half gay that her daughter loved him so well she had no tenderness for any one else She then entered abrubtly upon the affair of Sir Charles though she hardly expected Mr Herbert would join with her in condemning Sophia  He pleasingly surprised her by saying that Sophia was to blame and that he came prepared to chide her for her petulance and obstinacy  Mr Herbert who saw a sweet impatience in Sophia's looks explained himself immediately and told her he had met Sir Charles who had fully removed all the suspicions his strange conduct had occasioned and convinced him that he deserved more pity than censure  No doubt pursued he looking on Sophia with a smile you will be surprised to hear young lady that Sir Charles was witness to the interview you had in the meadow behind Mr Lawson's house with a certain handsome youth whom he had heard was his rival and a favoured rival too What were his thoughts do you imagine when he saw this handsome youth throw himself at your feet and kiss your hand  Mrs Darnley now looked at her daughter in great astonishment and Sophia who yet did not recollect the circumstance of her meeting William was so perplexed she knew not what to say  Mr Herbert enjoyed her innocent confusion for a few moments and then repeated all that Sir Charles had told him of his jealousy and rage his vain attempts to banish her from his remembrance the resolution he had formed after his conversation with Mr Howard concerning her and how happily he had been undeceived at Mr Lawson's where he found his supposed rival was the husband of her friend  "Well" interrupted Mrs Darnley with great vehemence  I hope you are satisfied now Sophia I hope you will treat Sir Charles with more civility if he comes againMr Herbert  I beg you will exert your power over her upon this occasion I think there is no doubt of Sir Charles's honourable intentions  Thus she ran on while Sophia who had listened to Mr Herbert's relation with the softest emotions of pity tenderness and joy continued silent with her eyes fixed upon the ground  Mr Herbert willing to spare her delicacy told Mrs Darnley that relying uponSophia's good sense and prudence he had ventured to assure Sir Charles of a more favourable reception when her prejudices were removed  He will come tomorrow my child pursued he to implore your pardon for all the errors of his past conduct and to offer you his hand I am persuaded you will act properly upon this occasion and in a marriage so far beyond your hopes and expectations acknowledge the hand of Providence which thinks fit to reward you even in this world for your steady adherence to virtue  Sophia bowed and blushed her mother in a rapture embraced and wished her joy  Mr Herbert now endeavoured to change the conversation to subjects more indifferent but Mrs Darnley ever thoughtless and unseasonable could talk of nothing but Sir Charles and the grandeur which awaited her daughter All night her fancy ran upon gilt equipages rich jewels magnificent houses and a train of servants and she was by much too happy to taste any repose but Sophia enjoyed the change of her fortune with much more rational  delight and among all the sentiments that arose in her mind upon this occasion that of gratitude to heaven was the most frequent and most lively  Mr Herbert who had accepted a lodging in Sophia's cottage went to Sir Charles the next day according to his promise He found him waiting for him full of anxious impatience and hearing from the good old man that Sophia was disposed to receive him favourably he embraced him in a transport of joy and his chariot being already ordered they drove immediately to the village  Mrs Darnley welcomed the baronet with a profusion of civilities Sophia's behaviour was full of dignity and soft reserve  Sir Charles after a long conversation with her obtained her leave to demand her of her mother to whom he shewed the writings which were already all drawn and by which Sophia had a jointure and pinmoney equal to the settlements that had been made upon lady Stanley  He now ventured to intreat that a short day might be fixed for their marriage It was with great difficulty that Sophia was prevailed upon to consent but her mother's impetuosity carried all before it and Mr Herbert himself supported the young baronet's request  The ceremony was performed by Mr Lawson in his own parishchurch after which he and his amiable family accompanied the new wedded pair to their countryseat where they passed several days with them  Mr Herbert having previously acquainted Sir Charles with Harriot's situation the baronet tho' he detested her character and declared he never could pardon her for the miseries she had caused him yet was desirous to have her decently settled and promised to give a thousand pounds with her in marriage if a reputable match could be found for her he even put notes for that sum into Mr Herbert's hands and earnestly recommended it to him to take the affair under his management  Harriot during the time she lived with her mother had been courted by a young tradesman in tolerable circumstances and although she thought it great insolence for a person in business to pretend to her yet actuated by a true spirit of coquetry while she despised the lover she took pleasure in his addresses  This young man still retained some tenderness for her and allured by the prospect of a fortune was willing notwithstanding any faults in her conduct to make her his wife  Mrs Darnley proposed him to her and Mr Herbert enforced her advice with all the good sense he was matter of But Harriot received the proposal with the utmost disdain insisted that she was married as well as her sister that her rank in life was superior to hers and added by way of threat that her appearance should be so likewise  The extraordinary efforts she made to support this boast engaged lord L in expences that entirely alienated his affections from her disgusted  as he long had been with her insolence and folly  His relations concluded a match for him with a young lady of suitable rank and fortune and after making a small settlement on Harriot he took leave of her for ever  The vexation she felt from this incident threw her into a distemper very fatal to beauty The yellow jaundice made such ravage in her face that scarce any of those charms on which she had valued herself so much remained All her anxious hours were now employed in repairing her complexion and in vain endeavours to restore lustre to those eyes sunk in hollowness and tinctured with the hue of her distemper  Although thus altered the report of the fortune she was likely to have made her be thought a prize worthy the ambition of a young officer who had quitted the business of a peruke maker in which he was bred for an ensign's commission which made him a gentleman at once  He offered himself to Harriot with that assurance of success which the gaiety of his appearance and his title of captain gave him reason to expect with a lady of her turn of mind  Harriot charmed with so important a conquest soon consented to give him her hand and Sir Charles Stanley finding his character not exceptionable gave her the fortune he had promised to which Sophia generously added a thousand pounds more The baronet procured her husband a better commission but designedly in one of the  colonies whither he insisted upon his wife's accompanying him  Harriot in despair at being obliged to quit the delights of London soon began to hate her husband heartily and he entering into her disposition and character lost all esteem and tenderness for her Her behaviour justified the rigid confinement he kept her in and while she suffered all the restraint of jealousy she was at the same time mortified with the knowledge that pride and not love was the source of it  Mrs Darnley lived not long after the departure of her favourite daughter for so Harriot always continued to be  Sophia attended her mother during her long illness with the most duteous care and had the satisfaction to be assured by Mr Lawson who assisted her in her preparations for death that her attachment to the world which the affluent circumstances to which she was raised but too much increased had at length given way to more pious sentiments and she died with the resignation of a christian  The ill conduct of her sister and the death of her mother proved at first some interruption to Sophia's happiness but these domestic storms blown over she began to taste the good fortune which heaven had bestowed on her her chief enjoyment of it was to share it with others and Sir Charles who adored her put it amply in her power to indulge the benevolence of her disposition  He took upon himself the care of rewarding her friends he presented Mr Lawson to a very considerable living he procured Dolly's husband a genteel and lucrative employment and married her younger sister to a relation of his own  Mr Herbert who was above receiving any other gratification from Sir Charles than the entire friendship which he ever preserved for him had the satisfaction to spend most of his time with his beloved daughter as he used tenderly to call Sophia and to behold her as happy as the condition of mortality admits of  Sir Charles's tenderness for her seemed to increase every day and when Mr Herbert once took occasion to compliment him upon the delicacy the ardor and the constancy of his affection he replied with a smile  You attribute to me a virtue which in this case I cannot be said to possess had my passion for my Sophia been founded only on the charms of her person I might probably e'er now have become a mere fashionable husband but her virtue and wit supply her with graces ever varied and ever new Thus the steadiness of my affection for her is but a constant inconstancy which attaches me successively to one or other of those shining qualities of which her charming mind is an inexhaustible source  THE LIFE OF Sir ANTHONY VANDYCK CONCLUDED  HE drew the marquis Giulio Brignole a famous poet on horseback he drew also the picture of the marchioness his wife in which he seemed to oblige nature itself for by eternising that beauty he gave an instance to all posterity of what she had been able to perform  He drew the picture of the doge Palavicino in his habit of ambassador to the pope and George Paulo Balbi on horseback which was a most exquisite picture but because of his conspiracy his face was blotted out being a traitor to his country and that of Francisco Maria of the same family made in the place There is also in this person's house of the hand of Vandyck the picture of an old man in white armour his right hand holds a general's staff and his left the pommel of his sword and is in picture as great a soldier as the marquis Spinola was in effect and is generally supposed to be intended for him  The queen of Sweden has in Rome also of the hand of Vandyck the picture of a boy of the family of the Imperiali which appears so much alive that no body would judge it but to be really so  Besides these pictures of particular persons he made some histories amongst which there is a crucifix with St Francis and our Saviour together with the patron of the picture at prayers Vandyck had now a great mind to go into Sicily Prince Filibert of Savoy being viceroy he drew his picture but the plague happening about this time and the death of the prince to whom cardinal Doria succeeded Vandyck likewise having received some disaster in Palermo retired in great haste to his home of Genoa carrying with him the cloth for a picture for the oratory of the society of the rosary in which he represented the Virgin encompassed with the glory of angels that present her each with a crown At the bottom is St Dominic with the five virgin saints of Palermo amongst which are St Katherine and St Rosary and a child that holds his hand to his nose because of the stench that comes from a dead head that lies upon the ground by which he designs to express the plague from which the city was delivered by the intercession of those saints  This picture being finished and sent to Palermo he betook himself again to the drawing of faces by which having got a good sum of money he returned to his own town of Antwerp extolled by all and welcomed by his friends after  the absence of some years He employed himself here mostly in drawing faces yet he likewise painted some history pieces which are dispersed through all Flanders and many other places of which we shall collect some few there being already some that are made public by the engraver Amongst the first of them that was seen at Antwerp was the marriage of St Joseph in St Michael's church where the saint kneels before the Virgin whilst she gives him her right hand which is proposed to him by an angel For the nuns of Begginage he drew a pietà that is our Saviour dead in the lap of his mother and Magdalen kneeling kissing the wound of his hand with a St John For the Magdalen he drew his sister's face who was then a nun to whom he made a present of the picture He drew also another pietà for St Francis's church which is as much esteemed as any thing he did He drew our Saviour extended on a windingsheet with his head on his mother's bosom who opening her arms lifts up her eyes to heaven behind stands St John that takes one of the arms of our Saviour and shews the wound to two angels who are lamenting at his feet  These three last figures are in halfshadow which gives great force to the naked figure of our Saviour upon whom he makes the principal light fall To the same sister Susanna Vandyck he dedicated the engraven design of another picture in St Austin's which is very remarkable for liveliness of colour and variety of invention The saint being in  an extacy is sustained by two angels On one hand of him stands St Monaca and on the other a saint of his order and to St Austin in this rapture the divinity is revealed from above one of the angels pointing up to our Saviour whose arms are spread ready to embrace him and at his feet several little angels with divers symbols as one of them holds a sceptre with the eye of Providence upon it another a branch of olive the symbol of peace a third lifts up a snake with his tail in his mouth the emblem of eternity a fourth opposes himself to a flaming sword a fifth looks the son of justice in the face together with several other mysteries symbolically expressed and above all a triangle to express the trinity with the name written in Hebrew characters  For the sisters of St Dominic he painted a crucifix the saint on one side and St Catherine of Siena on the other and another crucifix in Ghent with a Magdalen that embraces the cross and St John Behind is a man armed on horseback that gives orders to one of the crucifiers to reach the spunge to our Saviour adored and lamented by the angels In Malines in St Francis's church are three other pieces of his hand our Saviour upon the cross over the high altar and over two other altars St Bonaventure saying mass and the miracle of St Anthony of Padua when the horse kneeled before the host  As for drawing of faces in which Vandyck seemed more especially to excel whilst he continued in Brussels he drew almost all the nobility in  Flanders having justly acquired greater reputation than any painter since the death of Titian Indeed he gave his pictures a certain air and grace in the posture such perhaps as was admired in Apelles when he had drawn Alexander and Antigonus  He drew the infanta at length and Mary of Medici the queenmother sitting and the duke of Orleans her son at the time they fled into Flanders Of his hand are also the pictures of the cardinal infant of prince Thomas of Savoy in armour on horseback and many other great personages  In the townhouse of the same city he drew after the life the magistrates of that place sitting in judgment and this is looked upon as one of his best pieces being composed with great judgment and accurately finished He drew for the prince of Orange a story out of Pastor Fido who bought also of his hand the Virgin with the child Jesus before whom little angels are dancing  This picture is at present in the possession of Lord O  ford at Horton  Many other of his pictures both stories and faces may be seen at Antwerp in Van Ham's house as also in that of Diego Vueerdt's who amongst the rest has also those of king Charles the first and his queen drawn at the time Vandyck presented himself to the court of England  In this abundance of employment and fame having as it were filled all Flanders with his renown  he resolved to make use of the king of England's favour who then called him for his service to London In this prince's court Rubens had already been honourably entertained the king being always a great lover of all sorts of ingenious arts and so great a friend and rewarder of foreign ingenuity that in all occurrences he not only countenanced but preferred them 'Twas so that upon Rubens' departure Vandyck succeeded to his favour which quickly augmented his wealth and therefore as it were necessarily confirmed him in his wonted ostentation of behaviour and splendor of equipage  He had however opportunity enough of reimbursing his great expences by frequent visits that were made him by the nobility who in that followed the example of the king who went often thither to see him paint and took delight in his conversation Vandyck seemed to vie with the magnificence of Parrasin by keeping of servants coaches horses musicians and buffoons with which he entertained such persons as came daily to him to be drawn who were also invited to his table where he spent no less than eight or ten pounds a day  Besides such as are already mentioned he kept men and women for models to paint by for his manner was as soon as the face was done to finish the rest by the help of these models placed in this or that posture  The king was pleased many times to be drawn by him so that Cavaliere Bernini at Rome being  ordered to make a marble bust of his majesty he was drawn on one cloth in three different views the one with a whole face the other two in profile and half profile  This picture is still in the possession of the family of Bernini at Rome    He drew the king and queen in half length holding a sprig of myrtle between them and another of them with the young princes He drew also the king on horseback attended by a person that bears his helmet after him  In the gallery at Kensington    He drew general Goring in a posture of haranguing and the lord Newport master of the ordnance giving orders to his officers He drew the lord Arundel and his lady who being a great lover of painting was the means of Vandyck's being introduced to the king's favour and had been a great instrument of his coming into England which piece he finished to such perfection as if he was resolved to shew his art and gratitude together Of his hand also is that of the dutchess of Buckingham with her daughters who in token of the memory of her husband holds his picture in little in her hand  He drew the dutchess of Southampton like the goddess of Fortune sitting upon the globe  In the possession of lord Royston  and Sir Kenelme Digby with his wife sitting in two chairs with their children by them who being a great virtuoso himself Vandyck as it were by a  certain mutual consent of genius did more especially confide in him He drew him in several manners sometimes in his armour and sometimes in the habit of a philosopher In one of the latter there is represented a broken sphere the motto out of Horace  Si fractus illabatur orbis intrepidum ferient ruinae  which picture is one of the hundred that makes up the book of famous men published by Vandyck and printed at Antwerp the best of which are done by himself with aqua fortis amongst which you find also his own picture The same Sir Kenelme had a fancy to have his lady drawn in the form of Prudence sitting in a white robe with a coloured veil and belt of jewels One hand she reaches to two white doves and the other holds a serpent she sets her feet upon a cube to which are chained as slaves Deceit with her two faces anger envy with snakes about her head and profane Love blinded his wings clipt his bow broken his arrows thrown away and his torch extinguished with other naked figures according to the life Above all this is a glory of angels singing and playing upon instruments three of them holding between them a palm and garland over the head of Prudence in token of victory and triumph over those vices The motto is taken out of Juvenal  Nullum numen abest si sit Prudentia  Vandyck was so pleased with this invention that he copied it in little but not finished Both the one and the other during the troubles in England  land were carried into France  The large one is now in the palace at Windsor  For Sir Kenelme Digby he drew also our Saviour taken from the cross with Joseph and Nicodemus who were anointing him before they laid him in the sepulchre There is by them Magdalen and the Virgin falling in a swoon And with this several other pieces of devotion as St John Baptist in the wilderness Magdalen transported and in an extacy at the harmony of the Angels Judith with Holofernes's head in half figure our Saviour upon the cross giving up the ghost which Sir Kenelme made a present of to the princess of Guimenè when he was at Paris  He drew for him also the picture of a brown woman in the habit of Pallas armed and a plume in her helmet a most admirable head For the earl of Northumberland he drew our Saviour upon the cross with five angels that in golden chalices catch the blood as it falls from the wounds and under the cross are placed the Virgin St John and Mary Magdalen  He drew also for the king besides heads and many other pictures the dance of the Muses with Apollo in the middle of Parnassus another Apollo flaying Marsias a Bacchanal and a dance of Amorets that are sporting whilst Venus sleeps with Adonis And there being then in that court amongst many other virtuosi Nicholas Lanier a painter as well as musician he drew him in the form of David playing upon the harp before Saul  He drew also the dutchess of Richmond daughter of the duke of Buckingham which by reason of her incomparable beauty is occasion of a doubt whether art or nature is capable of greater perfection being drawn in the form of a Venus which is waited upon by her son duke Hamilton naked in the character of a Cupid with his bow and arrow He drew also the countess of Portland and the countess of Aubengey in the habit of Nymphs He drew also a lady in the character of a Venus standing by a black  For the queen he drew the Virgin with the child Jesus and St Joseph that are looking upon certain angels dancing upon the earth whilst others play to them upon several instruments in the air and this accompanied with a very pleasant landscape He drew also in imitation of Tintorett the crucifixion with the crucifiers that are lifting up the cross which is a work of great variety of figures  The picture also of the Blessed Virgin is very excellent She is represented holding up the infant Jesus between two angels that play upon instruments At his foot is the globe of the world Nor must we pass by the twelve apostles done by his hand and Christ with the cross all in half figure and to be found amongst that great collection of Charles Bosch bishop of Ghent which are made public by the press  He likewise painted a picture of Sampson breaking his bonds which was given by Van Woonsel  to the archduke Leopold governor of the Low Countries a person that seems to have passed all his time in the study of antiquity medals and painting as we may see by what is already printed of his study  Published by Teniers and commonly called Teniers's Gallery  Besides the ordinary rewards of the king's munificence to Vandyck his majesty conferred on him the honour of knighthood but being now because of his indispositions which he had laboured under some years desirous to withdraw himself from the drudgery of portrait painting to some great work by which his name might be transmitted with honour to posterity he took a journey to Paris with an intent to procure to himself the painting of the gallery of the Louvre but after having stayed there two months without any success he returned to England and proposed to the king by means of Sir Kenelme Digby to make designs for a suit of hangings for the Banquetinghouse at Whitehall the subjects of which were to be the ceremony of the crowning of the kings of England the institution of the order of the garter by Edward the third the procession of the knights in their robes and other functions civil and military The king was extremely well pleased with this design but thought his demand of eighty thousand pounds  In all the accounts that are written of Vandyck this extraordinary sum is said to be demanded which considering the different value of money would be equal to what two hundred and thirty thousand pounds is at this time it may be concluded that there is some mistake a cypher perhaps added too much  too extravagant  though it was believed the price would have been adjusted if Vandyck's death which happened at this time had not put a stop to all farther proceeding  Vandyck notwithstanding the vast sums of money he received left very little at his death having consumed it all in that splendid manner of living which was rather like a prince than a painter As to his person he was of small stature but well proportioned and active his features were regular and his countenance agreeable His hair was inclinable to red which is common to those of his country  It is very extraordinary that his best pictures are those he painted when very young when he not much exceeded twenty years He then used according to the practice of the Venetians a great body of colour which he afterwards changed for a smoother insipid but more expeditious manner using very little colour which after some time flying off left the light parts of the face too white and the half shadows too grey This is the general fault of his portraits of women and the portraits of the men are very often dry and flat and in the painter's phrase starved of colour To balance those faults which are sometimes found in his work he possessed other excellencies to the  highest degree of perfection the exact drawing and distinct manner of pronouncing the features the easy and agreeable attitudes at the same time marking the peculiar character of the person he drew has deservedly given him the character of the greatest painter the world has ever yet produced  TREATSE ON THE EDUCATION of DAUGHTERS CONCLUDED  The Vanity of Beauty and of Dress  THERE is nothing we ought so much to guard against as vanity in young ladies They come into the world with a vehement desire to please finding themselves excluded from those paths by which men arrive at authority and glory they endeavour to balance that loss by all the captivating qualities of wit and person This gives rise to their soft and insinuating turn of conversation thence it is that they so earnestly aspire after beauty and every external grace and are so warmly interested in dress The fashion of a cap the disposition of a ribbon the form of a curl in this place or that the choice of a colour are to them matters of importance This excess is carried to a greater height among us than any other people the changebleness of our fancy occasions a perpetual revolution of mode so that to the love of dress that of novelty is superadded an article that has strange effects upon such minds  These two follies in confederacy overturn distinction of rank and introduce licentiousness of manners Void as we are of any regulations in dress or in furniture there is nothing effectual left with regard to difference of conditions for as to the tables of particulars that is what public authority cannot easily give rules to every one proceeds as he can afford or rather neglecting that consideration as his ambition or his vanity prompts him  It is this pride which often ruins whole families and their ruin draws after it the corruption of manners On one side persons of mean birth are stimulated to raise a hasty fortune a thing not to be compassed without sin as the Holy Ghost hath assured usOn the other persons of quality bereft of all resources stoop to the basest and most wretched methods of supporting their expence The consequence of which is that by insensible degrees honour and honesty and natural affection become extinguished even among the nearest relations Whence is all this evil but from the power which certain vain women have acquired of regulating fashions Whoever thinks of continuing in the gravity and simplicity of our ancient manners are by these pointed out to be laughed at as so many antiques  Apply yourself then to convince young women how much that reputation which results from a just behaviour and true good sense is more valuable than what can be attained from the pattern of a cap or fancy of a furbelow  Beauty you may say deceives the owner still more than it doth its admirers it disturbs it intoxicates the soul The most passionate lover is not more an idolater of his mistress than she is of herself A small number of years takes away the distinction between a handsome woman and another and reduces them both to an equality Beauty is sure to be pernicious unless it is instrumental to an advantageous matchBut how can it be so unless supported by merit and by virtue When for want of discretion and modesty she is no object for men of correct understandings and sensible of solid qualities whom can she hope to attract but some young fool who will make her unhappy  Those who found all their glory upon their beauty in a short time become ridiculous for unperceived by themselves they arrive to that time of life when its lustre decays yet still are they charming in their own eyes though the world is so far from being charmed with them that they inspire nothing but disgust  This absolute attachment to beauty alone is just as unreasonable as to place all merit in bodily strength as do the barbarians and uncivilized nations  True gracefulness hath not the least dependance on a vain and affected mode of dress yet it is not amiss to have some regard to propriety proportion and suitableness in our apparel with which we necessarily cover ourselves But then these materials which we must put on and which we  may render as commodious as we please can never under the name of ornaments invest us with real beauty  I would take the pains to shew young ladies the noble simplicity that appears in the statues and other figures remaining with us of the Greek and Roman women There they will see that the hair tied negligently in a knot behind the drapery full and floating in long pleats are at the same time agreeable and majestic  It would be well if they were to hear the discourse of some painters or any other person that has entered into the exquisite taste of the ancients Let their minds be elevated ever so little above the prejudion of fashion and they will quickly hold in contempt those methods of torturing the hair into unnatural curls in which there is neither grace nor elegance  I am sensible we are not to propose they should copy the garb of antiquity that would be an extravagant thing but they may without singularity adopt the taste of simplicity in dress so noble so graceful and so suitable to the decent manners of Christians so that while they outwardly conform to the present custom they might at least learn how to think of it they would fall in with the fashion as a disagreeable obligation and allow no more to it than they cannot well avoid Teach them early and frequently to observe the vanity the gidiness whence the inconstancy of fashion arises That it is a matter very ill understood appears plainly when we see  persons encumber their heads with a load of ornaments true elegance follows nature and never constrains her  But fashion destroys itself pretends to aim at perfection and never hits it at least it will not stop there Some reason there would be in changing in order to change no more after having once found what is perfectly commodious and genteel but to go on changing without end surely this is to pursue inconstancy and irregularity not genuine politeness nor good taste  And so in general mere caprice predominates 'tis the women's prerogative to decide in this matter Thus the lightest the shallowest understanding influences all others they neither take up nor quit any thing upon reason It has been the mode for a considerable time though never so well invented that's enough to discard it and another though never so ridiculous shall take its place and be admired by its title to novelty  After having laid this groundwork we may go farther and shew the regulations of Christian modestyand may say we are taught by our religion that man is conceived in sin his body afflicted by a contagious illness proves an inexhaustible source of temptation to his soul Jesus Christ teaches us to place all our virtue in fear and in distrust of ourselveswould you be willing one may ask to hazard your own soul or your neighbour's for the sake of a foolish vanity Be terrified then at the thought of displaying the uncovered bosom  and every other immodestyThough these faults were committed without design still they are the result of vanity and an unbridled desire of pleasing Can this be a justification before God or man for so rash a conduct so scandalous so contagious to others This blind desire of pleasing doth it suit with the mind of a Christian who ought to regard as a species of idolatry every thing that turns us away from the love of the Creator and in comparison with him the contempt of the creatures  In seeking to please what mean we Is it not to excite the passions of mankind and have they so much power over them as shall restrain them from going to excess Ought we not to impute to ourselves all the consequences and do they not always run too high if once put in motion  It is you that prepare a subtle and mortal poison pour it out upon the spectators and believe yourself innocent  Add to this argument examples of persons whose modesty has been their commendation and others whose immodesty has drawn upon them the severest censures  Never suffer them to wear what is beyond their rank Check all their fanciesshew them the danger the contempt they are exposed to from all persons of discretion when they in this manner forget who they are  Another article remains with regard to girls of a fine genius which is to bring them into a right way of thinking for if we do not take care  they in their vivacity are apt to intermeddle to talk on most things to give their opinion on subjects disproportioned to their capacity at other times to affect a listlesness out of pure delicacy  A young lady should not talk but as occasion requires and then with an air of doubt and deference nay as to subjects out of the reach of women in general she should not speak upon them at all though well informed For what if her memory be never so good what if she has vivacity a pleasant turn of speech a faculty of conversing with ease and gracefulness all these qualities will be in common to her and many others of her sex far from being sensible women and in themselves despicable Instead of this let her endeavour after an exact and steady conduct an uniform and correct state of mind let her learn how to keep council and carry on an affair of moment this quality so rare to be found will sufficiently distinguish her  As to delicacy and the affectation of listlesness these are to be repressed by demonstrating how true good taste consists in accommodating oneself to things according to their utility  Good sense and virtue alone are worthy of estimation and both these require of us to look upon dislike and listlesnesness not as a commendable delicacy but as the infirmity of a sickly mind  Seeing we must converse with gross understandings and have a share in unentertaining businesses it is the part of reason which is the only  true delicacy to be as unrefined as those we are to mingle with  A spirit which hath all the taste for politeness but which knows to rise above it upon a necessity to enter into more solid matters is infinitely superior to those so delicate ones and surcharged with their own disgust  In the next place let us proceed to the consideration of those many articles with which a married woman ought to be acquainted what are her duties Upon her lies the education of her children of the boys to a certain age of the girls till they be married the government of her domestics their morals their service the disbursements of housekeeping the method of living with oeconomy and at the same time in figure often even the letting of farms and receiving rents Women's knowledge and that of men's also ought to be limited by their functions and the difference of them ought to make the difference of their studies by this rule then the subjects abovementioned will be the bounds of female information but at this rate a woman of curiosity will be apt to think it put under great restraints She deceives herself and all for want of perceiving the importance and extent of the things I propose for her to learn  What degree of penetration is requisite for her to discern the temper the genius of every particular child to fall upon a method of conduct towards each that shall best discover their humour their biass and their talents to check the passions on their first disclosure to instil wholesome  maxims and remedy every error How much prudence ought she to be mistress of for gaining and maintaining an ascendency over them without risquing the loss of friendship and confidence Nay is it not absolutely necessary for her to observe and thoroughly know the persons she places about her children Most certainly A mother of a family ought to be fully instructed in religion endowed with an understanding sound steady assiduous and exercised in government  Can any one doubt of these duties being incumbent on women seeing they naturally fall to their share even in the lifetime of their husbands when otherwise employed or absent from home and to a state of widowhood they are more immediately annexed  Here I omit to enter into all the particulars a woman should be instructed in for the purpose of education because this hint may serve to give them a notion in general of the extensive knowledge they ought to have Add to this family oeconomy The generality of ladies look upon that as a mean employment only fit for country people and farmers or at most for a housesteward or woman housekeeper and these more especially who are bred up in softness plenty and idleness hold every branch of it in the utmost contempt  These conceive very little difference between a life in the country and the life of the savages of Canada Talk to them of corn of cultivation of the nature of estates or rents or rights of  lordships of the best way of letting land or appointing receivers they will believe you are for having them degrade themselvesand yet this proceeds from pure ignorance The ancient Greeks and the Romans those adroit and polished people applied themselves diligently to this science of oeconomy The noblest among them wrote books which are still preserved to us upon their own experience and descended even to the lowest articles of husbandry  It is a known fact that their victorious generals disdained not to work with their own hands and from the triumphal car returned to the plough  This is so distant from our manner that it would not be credited did history leave the least room to doubt Whereas what more natural reason is there for our defending or enlarging our territories than in order to cultivate them in peace Of what service is victory but to gather the fruits of peace  After all true solidity of understanding consists in a willingness to be exactly informed how all those things are managed which are the substantials of human life for upon these the very greatest affairs are grounded  The power and the felicity of a state consists not in a multitude of provinces ill cultivated but in the knowing to raise from its possessions a sufficency to maintain without difficulty a numerous people  To attain a knowledge of every art applicable to oeconomy to regulate the sum of all the affairs  of a family which may be stiled a small republic requires undoubtedly much higher genius and more extensive than to understand play or to descant on the fashions or to exert all the minute gentilities of conversation It is but a despicable spirit that can do no more than discourse well Women there are in numbers whose talk abounds with solid maxims but in whose conduct for want of early application nothing but the frivolous is to be found  Nevertheless we must be on our guard against the opposite fault women run a risque of going into extremes It is good to use them from their childhood to have something under their care to keep accounts to know the method of buying and how every thing ought to be made to be useful yet I say take care lest oeconomy should degenerate into avarice be particular in shewing the ridiculousness of that passion tell them to be cautious for avarice produces but little profit and much dishonour A rational mind need carry a frugal and diligent scheme of life no farther than to avoid that shame and injustice which are ever annexed to a prodigal ruinous conduct The true end of retrenching superfluous expence is to be in a better capacity to answer all the calls of decency friendship and charity  There are occasions when the parting with money is being a greater gainer Good order is the profitable thing and not a few petty articles of sordid penuriousnesswherefore fail not to paint in strong colours that gross mistake of some ladies  who can please themselves with saving a taper and let a steward wrong them in the bulk of their affairs  Be no less a friend to neatness and order than to oeconomy and housewifery use young ladies not to permit any sluttishness or misplacing of things about the house or furniture and bring them to observe that nothing contributes more to oeconomy and neatness than every thing being in its proper station as minute as this maxim seems it will have considerable effects if strictly kept to Is any thing wanted no time's wasted in looking for it no trouble dispute or disturbance ensues you take it from its place make use of it and replace it again  Order is a principal branch of neatness because a proper arrangement affects the eye forcibly and besides the place assigned to each being that which is most suitble to it not only for pleasing the eye but for the preservation of the thing it is therefore less liable to decay less liable to accidental damage and even shews a propriety in its being there  The same spirit of accuracy which prompts to orderliness prompts also to cleanliness To which advantage add that such a habit prevents idleness and confusion in our domestics and more than this as it makes them ready in the discharge of their duties so doth it keep us clear of the temptation to impatience at the delays which must happen when the things we call for can hardly be found But at the same time  avoid running into an excess of elegance and nicety Nicety in moderation is a virtue but when we carry our taste to too great a height it becomes narrowness of mind for good taste rejects extream delicacy it treats little matters as they are and will not be affected by them Therefore shew in the children's presence your derision of those fopperies some women are so fond of and by which they are insensibly drawn into useless expences  Accustom them to a plain and practicable niceness You may inform them how every thing ought to be done but still further that they ought to be easy without itfor what a squeamish mind does it betray to grumble if a soop fails of being exactly seasoned another thing ill pleated a chair a little too high or too low Undoubtedly it is an evidence of a much better understanding to be designedly indifferent rather than delicate in matters so insignificant  And this faulty delicacy if not repressed in women of lively parts has worse effects with regard to their conversation than other subjects for to them the generality of company will seem so flat and so tiresome and the least slip in politeness so monstrous they are always full of scorn and disgust Let these ladies know betimes that nothing is so injudicious as to judge superficially of a person by his carriage without sounding the depth of his understanding his sentiments or useful qualifications Demonstrate by frequent instances how much a country gentleman with his coarse  manners or if you please ridiculous teazing civility but with a good heart and steady head is more worthy of esteem than the most accomplished courtier who under that behaviour conceals a heart ungrateful unjust and capable of every sort of dissimulation and baseness and that there is always a weakness adherent to those minds so given to be fatigued and disgustedNo kind of conversation is so poor that some good may not be extracted from it and though we are in the right to chuse the best when we have choice yet one consolation is left us when distrest that we may put people upon discoursing of what they know and then good sense will draw information from the dullest company  A POETICAL EPISTLE From BUSY the Lapdog in London to SNOWBALL the Buckhound in Windsor Forest  June  IF we like men could envy and malign  At Nature's or at Fortune's gifts repine  When great be insolent when little mean  When rich and fat disdain the poor and lean  Then might I puisny Busy thy vast size  Contemplate mighty hound with grieving eyes  Thy strength thy nose sagacious snowwhite coat  And most the tuneful thunder of thy throat  Then might I Busy deck'd with em'ralds scorn  The starv'ling puppy gnawing a stag's horn  Beneath the hovel red with ash of peat  And think the wretch as odious as his meat  But nor contempt nor envy shook my breast  Thee I admir'd and Empress I carest  Tho' in her nonage the poor simple whelp  Kept no decorums and scarce knew to yelp  Empress may prove the terror of the wood  For Empress mighty Snowball's of thy blood  Say did I not accept at romps a game  With the black young cur I forget his name  His life in dirt and poverty begun  Yet he may rise the fav'rite of the gun  And I've heard it said where I have din'd  That true distinction amongst human kind  Lies in the qualities and in the mind  O Snowball with what pleasure I confess  Thy condescension to my littleness  When on the floor I dar'd approach thee near  And gaz'd on the fine lappet of thine ear  At thy fair temples then my sattin hue  Seemed a black modish patch to distant view  To lick thy chaps to pinch thy spacious paws  Unfear'd the range of jav'lins in thy jaws  Or on my hindlegs bolt upright have tried  To reach the curious flavour of thy hide  Thou did'st not growl thou did'st not swing a tail  Might snap my ribs as ears of corn the flail  Conscious what dignity from goodness springs  And much too great to spurn at tiny things  All homage may your grandeur long receive  From lapdogs due and long unrival'd live  Be stroak'd be fed by that accomplish'd hand  Whose pen my master says adorns the land  O happy Snowball happy Cranbourn wood  Too happy rustics did ye know your good  Lo the tenth Muse illuminates your cot  Ah wretched rusticsye perceive her not  Eat Snowball legs of mutton while small I  Crack biscuit gingerbread and crust of pye  Or lap the remnants of the milky bowl  Which none on earth shall ever prove I stole  Joy thou in Windsor's verdant park and air  Pursue the chase and in the daughter share  Live in the favour of that learned fair  If my dear mistress smiles and pats my head  If she vouchsafes a corner of her bed  Busy's content and to her latest gasp  Will taste the happiness within her grasp  T W  To ISMENE playing on a Lute  WHEN fair Ismene to the grove retires  And joins her warbling accents to the lyre's  How sweet th' enchanting sounds the melting strains  With pleasing raptures fill our swelling veins  The eager ear with ravishment attends  The song our soul in extacy suspends  Soft we approach and awful silence keep  A silence more profound than that of sleep  We fear to move nay e'en to breathe we fear  Lest one soft accent should escape our ear  All things are hush'd the silent trees recline  Their rev'rend heads to hear the lays divine  The streams that ceas'd to purl now creep along  Unheard charm'd with the music of her song  The list'ning birds stoop on the bending wing  And hov'ring stay to learn of her to sing  Say ye blest angels whose harmonious lays  Unwearied sing eternal hymns of praise  Can heav'n itself Ismene's notes improve  When she's translated to the choirs above  PHILOSOPHY FOR THE LADIES CONCLUDED  Some reflections and deductions drawn from the works of Nature in general  AS we are now on the point of concluding the present design of this work it is necessary that we should form some kind of conclusion to that part of it which has had a relation to the works of Nature and the study of philosophy A conclusion I say with respect to our confined and narrow limits herein for such is the immense scope and extent which those subjects would have afforded us that could the prosecution of our plan have been pursued beyond the period of life alotted to ourselves or our children nay even to the farthest stretch of time our researches into the wonders of Nature's inexhaustible storehouse would have been no other than the pursuance of an apparent horizon the boundaries of which are ever flying before us and although they every moment present us with a fresh variety of enchanting objects yet are with respect to ourselves as absolutely distant at the last as at the first moment of our journey But to proceed  From even the very small portion concerning which we have been enabled to enter into a detail  of the numberless amazing properties bestowed on mankind and on the other parts of the animal creation what is the first the most natural deduction that must occur to every one What when we perceive that every one of the organs of this grand machine not only the larger and more apparently useful but even the more minute insignificant and almost invisible ones are furnished in the amplest manner not barely with such parts such limbs such mechanism as are needful for their mere existence but still more particularly with such peculiar contrivances such sagacity such intellectual faculties as must render that existence with respect to the place station and allotment of each individual absolutely and perfectly happysuch properties as enable every one of those beings to preserve that existence though surrounded by numberless dangers and to procure the means of supporting it in the midst of apparent scarcity and want What when we perceive these assistances bestowed on them with an endless variety with such a peculiar propriety to every single animal as if each was of itself the sole and peculiar care of ProvidenceWhat I say must be the immediate result of these observations but that the whole must be the work of infinite power of infinite wisdom of infinite goodness Who can cast his eyes around him even with the slightest reflection on what he sees on every side but must immediately cry out with the royal philosopher  How manifold are thy works O Lord in wisdom hast thou made them all  Can any one perceive the work of amazing art and maintain one moment's doubt of the existence of the artistMust he not indeed be a fool who can say in his heart there is no God  If then this reflection is the first that must arise from this delightful study and most undoubtedly it is so can we possibly give scope thereto without proceeding still farther and finding that due influence produced by it on our minds which must lead us to the warmest gratitude and the most ardent zeal to do every thing that may lead towards the rendering our services acceptable in his sight Can we look with unconcern on all these wondrous operations Can we perceive these incomprehensible proofs of infinite perfection in what are but the mechanical exertion perhaps no more than the sport if we may be allowed the expression of his wisdom and power without conceiving an idea infinitely more exalted of the almighty mind Can we be blind to the proofs that these present us with of his being equally the origin of all purity and the possessor of all ability Can we avoid being convinced that  He must delight in virtue  And that which he delights in must be happy  How strong an incitement this to the practice of that virtue which at the same time delights that Being whose minutest pleasure ought to be our supremest joy and ensures our own happiness in the very act itself How eminent then the advantage to ourselves and the good to society in general which might be derived from a proper  application of this study and from how evident a parity of reasoning will every thinking man be convinced whilst he sees every part of the creation in general formed with such a connection such a necessary dependance on every other part as well as on the great whole how strongly I say will he be convinced of the duty incumbent on himself to promote as much as possible this grand design and render his every action conducive to it in the peculiar circle which heaven has assigned to him to fill In how smooth how tranquil a path might all the transactions of this world proceed would every man but carry the reflection from natural to moral connections and persuaded that his own happiness must proportionably depend on that of every individual around him labour to accelerate the movement of these admirably contrived wheels instead of clogging them with the intricate machinery of selfinterest or dragging them back with the weight of vice and folly  But now let us consider Nature's works in a second point of view let us consider man and every other animated part of the creation as a separate and detached being and placed in his peculiar sphere without connection or relationship with any other even in this light how admirable how incomprehensible is the extent of omnipotent care in this formation of each How amazingly is each animal provided by the allwise Fountain of good with every means for his preservation how admirably are dangers and necessities spread  around him as if they were designed to shew the unlimited wisdom of the Creator in the variety of means pointed out to him for avoiding the one and relieving the other at the same time that both are rendered the instruments of his happiness from that consciousness of relief which heightens the enjoyment of every blessing by a sensibility of the misery attached to its opposite situation  In this view how much has man in particular to felicitate himself upon how many grateful reflections ought his mind to overflow with when he considers his situation as more exposed more helpless in its original and apparent state than that of any other animal yet in the course of life in the period of his existence more thoroughly protected more perfectly supplied with conveniencies than that of his fellowcreatures would be even if the various resources of them all could be united for the service of each individual With what an eye of admiration ought he to look up to the Being who by a peculiar distinction has so highly and almost partially favoured him as to bestow on him alone that single spark from heaven that emanation from himself which in itself answers every purpose that any thing beneath immortality ought to wish for the power of executing  Again let us permit this last reflection to produce another very proper effect on our minds and at the same time that it inspires us with the most exalted degree of acknowledgment to the just giver of all things suffer it to strike us with  a conscious humility and curb that indecent that dangerous pride which frequently puffs up the mind of man and is the occasion that conceiving himself the lord of the universe  Being placed so high  He 'sdains subjection and thinks one step higher  Would set him high'st  But let this lord of nature this sovereign of the universe call his eyes around and see all other beings emerging into life almost in a state of perfection let him look on the poor servile dog and the domestic kitten within two months of their appearance in the world able to quit the tender parent's care and seek their prey endowed with all the faculties to find and to destroy it Let him observe the little duckling bursting from the egg and rushing instantly into an unruly a destructive element to pick up food and taste the joys of living Let him go farther still and mark the light the tender the seemingly insignificant ephemeron with a life destined but for some hours continuance burst from its embrio state in one element and almost imperceptibly become the inhabitant of another enabled to rove unlimited and taste of every pleasure his being will admit of After even this slight review let him but turn his eyes back on his own infant state and see himself "mewling and puking in the nurse's arms" unable for a time to find a use even for his very limbs for a yet longer period of time deprived of the advantages of language and still much longer under the necessity of aid and of instruction  to form his reasoning faculties and render him capable of self assistance  Again when brought to his maturity and fulness of perfection as to his natural state how still deficient in every particular both of attack defence and sustenance First for attack the lion has his teeth the bull his horns the eagle his talons and the hawk his beak either to combat with their foes or to destroy their preybut what has man None of all these Consider him unassisted he could not stab the sheep knock down the ox or combat with the hog did either know his weakness or their own power to resist him With what propriety then do we pray to the Bestower and Disposer of all life to give us our daily Bread  Next for defence the horse has his heels the fox his holes the calamary can spread a cloud of ink around him and the torpedo strike with numbness and insensibility the creature which shall dare to touch him The cat can swell her form to twice its size and even a little bird  The Wryneck  distort her figure into such shapes of terror as shall deter even animals of bulk and power from coming near her nestBut which of these advantages does man possess His speed the heavy elephant will overtake he cannot dig into the earth to hide him from his foe nor with his firmest frown or fiercest attitude drive back the hungry wolf or half starved tyger  Then for his sustenance the crocodile can change his form and the camelion his colour the spider spread a web and the polypus expand a net to allure and to entrap their prey but man unaided by the means of art and of a thousand substances not any way appertaining to himself might starve in the midst of plenty and daily suffer the fabled fate of Tantalus to see perpetually before him the greatest delicacies without being able to procure or to enjoy them  What deductions then may be drawn from these observations Evidently the two following with which we shall terminate this discourse viz First that whatever we may imagine of ourselves and of our selfapplied superiority it must if it has existence at all be owing to the favour of that omnipotent Being who was equally the creator of all other creatures as of ourselves and that therefore instead of harbouring an unbecoming pride on the possession of the peculiar gift of reason which supplies in one single property all the deficiencies I have been just mentioning we ought assuredly to be inspired with the utmost humility united to gratitude when we consider ourselves as selected out to enjoy that blessing from amidst such an infinite variety of his other works every one of which appears to have an equal and many of them even a higher claim to that most desirable preferenceand secondly that since in natural advantages many even of the lowest and most insignificant beings seem greatly  to excel us there certainly must be some other part of us some more intellectual and immaterial part belonging to us in which our superiority must necessarily consist to which therefore we ought to pay a more particular attention and on the cultivation and improvement of which must wholly depend every essential view of happiness both in our present state and that which is to come  THE LADY'S GEOGRAPHY  DESCRIPTION of the Island of CEYLON CONCLUDED  THERE are in this island a very particular kind of blackish leaches which lurk under the grass and are extremely troublesome to foot travellers They are at first not thicker than a horse hair but grow to be of the bulk of a goose's quill and two or three inches in length They are only to be seen in the rainy seasons at which times crawling up the legs of those who walk barefoot as is the custom of that country they sting them and suck their blood with so much quickness that it is impossible to get rid of them before they have effected their purpose This might seem incredible were it not for the prodigious multitudes in which they make their attacks which consequently renders a considerable time necessary to oblige them to quit their hold  As the island is very full of woods and lakes it is natural to imagine that it must also be very amply stored with birds and fishes Among the former are great plenty of green perroquets but of a kind that cannot be taught to speak They have two other sorts of birds however which learn very easily they are about the size of a blackbird and are called by the natives by the names of malcouda and caucouda the first is black and the other of a bright gold colour  As to fish their lakes and rivers are extremely full of them particularly of salmon but the inhabitants seem to set no great value on them  Serpents of many kinds both venemous and inoffensive are found in this island amongst which the most remarkable are st the pimberah which is as thick as a man's body feeds mostly on deer and other animals of a like kind and it is said will swallow a kid whole whose horns will sometimes pierce through his belly and kill him d the polonga which is about five or six feet long and extremely venemous And d the noya which is a greyish snake not above four feet long and is marked on its head with the appearance of a pair of spectacles He is a mortal enemy to the polonga and whenever they meet the battle constantly terminates in the death of one or the other of them He is however very harmless on which account the Indians call him noya rodgerah or the royal snake  There is a kind of venemous lizard in this country which they name hiekanella and which harbours in the eves and thatchings of the houses but will not attack a man unless provoked But the most formidable creature belonging to this island is a prodigious large black hairy spider which they call democulo Its body is as large as one's fist and its legs proportionable Nothing can be more mocking than its bite which is not immediately mortal but affects the senses and occasions madness As to the men they find assistance in this case from certain herbs and barks  when applied to in time but the cattle are frequently bit or stung by these monstrous creatures and die without any remedy having been yet discovered to preserve them  As to the mineral kingdom this country produces many kinds of gems and in great quantity particularly sapphires rubies and cat's eyes but these are all secured for the king's use They have besides both iron and lead mines but these as well as many other valuable productions of the island are considered of little worth compared to the cinnamon and wild honey which are properly speaking the peculiar traffick of the country and of which the Dutch have made an amazing advantage since their conquest of it  Having thus got through the description of the island of Ceylon and mentioned the most extraordinary particulars of curiosity in it we shall now take leave of our readers recommending to their perusal the farther accounts given by the travellers who have visited it and who seem all to unite in opinion as to its being one of the finest most amply stored and most amazingly diversified spot throughout the whole extent of the East Indies  FINIS  CONTENTS  INtroduction to the Trifler  Page  The Trifler No  I Page  Studies
