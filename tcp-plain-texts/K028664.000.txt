 AN HISTORICAL ESSAY ON THE PRINCIPLES OF  POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS  IN A STATE CHIEFLY DEDUCED FROM THE FRENCH ENGLISH AND JEWISH HISTORIES  WITH AN APPLICATION OF THOSE PRINCIPLES IN A COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE ASSOCIATIONS OF THE YEAR AND THAT RECENTLY INSTITUTED BY THE  WHIG CLUB  By the Rev JOHN BRAND M A  LONDON PRINTED FOR T N LONGMAN PATERNOSTERROW AND J OWEN PICCADILLY AND SOLD BY ALL THE BOOKSELLERS IN LONDON AND WESTMINSTER  INTRODUCTION  IN the Address to the SUBSCRIBERS to the ASSO∣CIATIONS against REPUBLICANS and LEVELLERS prefixed to my  DEFENCE of the LETTER attributed to Mr REEVES  the attack of it is treated as ultimately directed against those very numerous and respectable Bodies to expose them to popular indignation an effect which if justly founded it could not fail to produce For if we be obliged to grant the justice of the accusation brought against him they appear as connected with a Man and as his opponents further assert with a Party systematically employed to subvert the Liberties of this Country Now the spirit of the FIRST ASSOCIATION and its principles it will be urged will pervade all those formed in imi∣tation of it and the former must be totally deter∣mined or at least strongly modified by the spirit and principles of its founders  WHEN OPPOSITION thought it expedient to make use of the Statutes to which they gave the name of "the GRENVILLE and PITT Acts" to bring the mass of the People into action upon the stage of Govern∣ment and upon that occasion declared by one of their Leaders that they should be so brought for∣ward it became necessary to deprive the Associated Defenders of the Constitution of the great weight they possessed in the nation from natural influence and from longdeserved respect and attachment for the whole of this weight they knew would be fully exerted in opposition to their plan Hence they were led by a kind of political necessity to the ac∣cusation of a Man connected by the relation ex∣plained above with each of their distinct Bodies And they indicated the consequences they meant to be drawn from it more fully in a more direct attack upon them by affirming that  proofs exist that the Associations against Republicans and Levellers are part of a system of a deeplaid conspiracy to establish a military despotism  Such were the measures they embraced in order to destroy the weight of the ASSOCIATIONS and even to excite the populace against them  NOW the latter cannot act unless they be em∣bodied The declaration that they  should  act was cotemporary with the accusations here stated Some mode is which they were to be embodied was there∣fore  probably then in contemplation and it is likely the specific mode since recommended by the COM∣MITTEE of the WHIG CLUB But to the success of any such plan the accusation of Mr REEVES and the ASSOCIATIONS was a most necessary preparatory measure The object these attacks would serve could only be pointed out in the DEFENCE generally the outlines of the finished plan could not be exa∣mined before they were given to the Public they are contained in the following paragraph taken from the Newspapers of that time  THE Committee of the Whig Club appointed to prepare and announce the Form of  A General Association of the People  for the Repeal of the two Statutes best known by the name of the Gren∣ville and Pitt Acts met at the Shakspeare Tavern the Right Honourable Charles James Fox in the Chair A Declaration of the Motives of the Club in recommending this Association was read by Mr Mackintosh and unanimously approved of The Association however goes only to the  single point  of the Repeal of those Laws and the Subscribers pledge themselves  only to prosecute that sole object  by every  legal and peaceable  means  IT is the Constitution of the Association not the specific motives which led the Members to asso∣ciate  or the end they hold forth  The object held out by them is  to restore the Law of Treason to the state in which it stood before the meeting of Parliament last winter or on the statute of Edw c  On this no remarks will be made in the body of the Tract but some strictures upon it will be found in the APPENDIX No  which will be examined on principles here to be investigated on which it will be shown that in its form it is highly dangerous and that it is not sanctioned by the pre∣cedent of  AN HISTORICAL ESSAY c c c  SECTION I SOME GENERAL REMARKS ON ASSOCIATIONS IN A STATE  IN these Remarks will be considered the cause and end of Associations their organization the compact entered into and its limits and object  THE Associations to be considered are such as are in a stricter sense popular where the individuals associate as equalsnot as heads of partiesor effective rulers of small districts of a kingdom  IN Society at large we may observe three degrees of union distinctly differing in effect and appearance the middle or average which is the very health of public spirit the weaker which is its corruption mostly pre∣ceding some fatal catastrophe and the stronger which is its fever sometimes the struggle of a vigorous habit to expel whatis deleterious in the constitution and some∣times terminating fatally  A SOCIETY or a part thereof may be brought into this stronger degree of union by different means Com∣mon principles will effect it by the force of an increased  reciprocal attraction of the individuals who compose it The union is greater or less as these are stronger or more remiss A party may likewise be condensed into greater union by external pressure These two causes are gene∣rally seen acting in conjunction  AT the commencement of such a union its object may be defined by a formal contract either in writing or by parole Its numbers may be increased by the accession of others who thus become virtually parties in the formal contract Every society or party is here said to be asso∣ciated when a very strong and unusual degree of union takes place among them from whichever of these sources it may have originated and by whatever contract tacit  Hence sudden insurrections when the insurgents act together and have something like a unity of object are Associations This object may be either abstracts as to establish the principles of equa∣lity or specific as to reduce the price of wheat  or express it may to combined  THE object of an Association is to unite the action of the Associators in some mode that of a  General As∣sociation of the People  or Mr Fox's Association is to bring a whole people into action including the popu∣lace  This follows from every definition this Party has given of the term  People    A SINGLE association of the people is the most per∣fect union they can be brought into but its force will be highly concentrated if it give obedience to a Directory at its head which "the General Association of the People" possesses in the remainder or rump of the Whig Club who have already assumed over its future members  something superior to legislative power in giving to the Association a constitution If an individual of the Direc∣tory sway all the rest for the present he is the effective Dictator of the Association It is easy to name one whose political character and ability seem to secure him that ascendancy The founders of this Association profess to attempt to make it universal if they succeed they will at first concentrate the greatest possible force under the greatest possible union  BUT no single power in a State should operate without a counterpoise at hand at least to check it The  General Association  by the very definition of the term is a power which can have no such counterpoise  IT perhaps might be more accurate to say that when any power puts a nation in motion in any direction ano∣ther should be always ready capable of deflecting its course upon occasion for it never in fact will continue long in a right track except by the composition of mo∣tion from two powers at least acting in different direc∣tions Now the whole State must obey the impulse of an Association really general it is a ship with every inch of canvas out without a rudder moved by the single im∣pulse of the wind Again in all cases where such Asso∣ciations exist and have only great influence the ship will not answer the helm or its working will be hindered greatly by it and the sea in which she is going at such times is always full of rocks and quicksands  WE have had in these latter Centuries only one species of despotism to fear that of Kings we have now two that of Kings and Demagogues The usurpations of the latter are the more sanguinary and ferocious When our  forefathers saw the former mustering round them powers which might hereafter be abused they lost no time to impose salutary limits upon them As much as the ty∣ranny of the latter is more dreadful with so much the more jealousy its gathering forces together ought to be guarded against We are not to shut our eyes upon the one but we are intensely to watch the other Great is the danger of popularity on certain principles to the in∣dividual who possesses it The man who is become a Dema∣gogue the lowest fall from wisdom has often lost his free∣dom of will to abstain from crimes before he knows it while he is the apparent conductor of his faction he is already become their passive instrument and in such a State the misery of those who are about to fall the victims of the atrocities called his may be next to his own they will not be of that magnitude which entitles them to be rated as second to it  THERE are other modes in which a people or a party scattered over the face of a country may associate That embraced by the upper and middle classes in is an example of one of them and the only one there is any present occasion to consider They formed themselves into local Associations the obligations they subscribed varied according to the opinion of every meeting No single form was followed to consolidate these numerous and perfectly insulated bodies into one they all seemed to have a like object but there was nothing more in their constitutions to give them unity of action unless we may suppose such union could result from the cor∣respondence most of them maintained with the commit∣tee of the original Association of which Mr REEVES was the Chairman The members of that Committee were the acknowledged heads of no party in the Statein this they  are far less formidable than the Whig Club and Mr REEVES himself with no pretensions to the higher or se∣condary posts of Government and holding not even a seat in the House to attach the members of these several bodies to him by the dependencies of expectation certainly has not the dangerous weight of their Leader This Committee then had no power to draw the other Associa∣tions into an union of any kind and no step to this end was taken by them among themselves  THESE independent Associations it is said exceeded two thousand in number they had all the union of two thousand individuals inhabiting a district in the state of equality without an elective assembly a senate of no∣bles or single person to govern them or of a cluster of two thousand independent republics without an assembly of the States at their head to give them that imperfect unity of which such confederacies have at certain periods been seen for a time to keep up the external appearance  IN these Associations the principle of union was not at all provided for in their original formation in that which I shall denominate "the Association of Mr Fox" because he is certainly its effective Head we have seen the leading feature to be the closest concentration of force and  that  of the whole people In this respect therefore the first measure is no precedent for the second  IT has been said in substance above that the object of all Associations is to combine the subscribers for imme∣diate action or to be in readiness to act on occasion By immediate action I understand acting in person and not mediately or by deputy Mr REEVES and Mr Fox have each addressed themselves to the people to form Asso∣ciations  To compare their several plans in a second point of view let the qualities of the immediate action of the people be now considered  SECTION II ON THE ACTION OF THE PEOPLE  WHEN the whole of the people or a great part of them are associated it is for some one purpose but let that purpose be what it may they will be bad agents therein There is not a maxim in Montesquieu which has more truth or brilliancy in it than the following  The people collectively have always too much action or too little Sometimes with a hundred thousand arms the multitude overthrows every thing sometimes with a hundred thousand feet it creeps only like an in∣sect  Le peuple a toujours trop d'action ou trop peu Quelquefois avec cent mitic bras il renverse tout quelquesois avec cent mille pieds il  va que comme les insectes  Esprit des Loix Liv ii c  THIS difference of the effect of the action of the peo∣ple must arise from the difference of the spirit by which they are actuated at such times and this again must depend much upon the object which excited it Now the object of these Associations is either the continuance of the present state of the members or the acquisition of a better by their united force and from this consideration we derive another division of Associations into Defensive and Offensive and both conjointly  HENCE as all Associations to gain what the members do not possess are Offensive an Association to regain what they cease to possess is Offensive also Its spirit at least will be equal in strength to that with which an acquisi∣tion of an object never possessed before is pursued and possibly more as some degree of resentment may warm it If the associators have been deprived of it by law they contend for an illegal possession or a legal right they pos∣sess not  LET us now compare these two classes of Associations as to their effects from the known qualities of human nature and afterwards from what History has given us upon the subject  THE fear of losing what we already enjoy occupies the mind but very little Hence Associations of parties formed upon a Defensive principle are very different in the spirit which pervades them and in their effects from those formed on principles of acquisition or Offensive Associa∣tions The efforts men exert to continue as they are par∣take greatly of the moderation of that frame of mind which gives birth to themcontent in their present state a sentiment which has not habitually all that force on our minds which it ought to have On the other hand there is no emotion which we indulge ourselves in with so little restraint as the hope of a change of our state for the better and the constancy of that indul∣gence is such that men habituate themselves to it until that passion has in most minds acquired a very distem∣pered magnitude and force This is the reason that when men form combinations in Civil Society to defend the good they enjoy there is too much inertness in all their movements but if the object of their formal union is  something they wish to acquire they are heated to a fervor which carries them far beyond the bounds of sobriety and expedience and when a State is divided into two parties the majority acting upon the first and the minority upon the second principle the latter has been too frequently able to overpower the former with the better cause and the apparent weight of influence on its side Hence Mr Hume considering the collision of two such parties says with great truth  One furious enthusiast is able by his active industry to surmount the indolent efforts of many sober and reasonable antagonists  Hist v p    THEREFORE these two kinds of Popular Associations the Defensive and Offensive fall under the two cases de∣scribed by Montesquieu in the first of which the action of the people has too little energy and in the last over∣whelms every thing in ruin The original Association of Mr REEVES and all those afterwards formed upon the same plan were Defensive being to guard the Constitu∣tion against Republicans and Levellers Mr Fox's Asso∣ciation is Offensive being against existing laws formed for that purpose  If a law be right  per se  an Association to procure the repeal of it is termed with equal justice Offensive whether it has been passed three days or three centuries and every law is to be so held until the contrary is demonstrated At the end of this Tract it will be shewn that the old Law of Treason contains a gross offence against the first principles of legislation    I SHALL now consider more particularly the nature of these two species of Associations chiefly deducing my conclusions from History beginning with that which is here termed Defensive  SECTION III ON THE SPIRIT OF DEFENSIVE ASSOCIATIONS OF THE PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN  THE spirit by which we may in future expect to see defensive Associations actuated will be clearly seen in the conduct of those which have preceded them The object of such an Association may be the defence of the authority of one or more of the constituent parts of the Legislature of particular laws or of the whole system  THE Royalists who followed the fortunes of Charles the First formed an Association in defence of the Crown The formal nature of this compact I shall presently come to the exposition of Before the adjournment of the Houses in September many excellent constitutional and municipal laws had been passed and if Parliament had suffered some violences to take place there seemed no danger of their being drawn into precedent To pass over the two outrages which took place immediately after that assembly met again the one on the part of the Com∣mons the other on the part of the Crown the first of which seemed calculated principally to draw after it some∣thing of the nature of the second  Appendix No III  I go to the further part of the conduct of that assembly They attempted to possess themselves of a great part of the executive power by originating commissions by bill for the highest offi∣cers  civil and military the Lords Lieutenants and Depu∣ties they refused to define the extent of their demands for the settlement of the nation  Hume v p  and they seized the King's magazines into their own hands The catalogue of their attempts of this kind might be enlarged  THE King was at last supported not only by a vir∣tual but what is entitled to be called a formal Associa∣tion according to the definition of such a compact gi∣ven above It was purely in its nature Defensive its ob∣ject was to maintain the Constitution and existing laws including those passed in the Parliament then sitting The articles of that of the Peers who first joined him at York were in writing The King made a Declaration  That he expected from them no obedience to any com∣mands which were not warranted by the laws of the land  They  answered this Declaration by a Protest in which they declared their resolution to obey no commands not so warranted Deliberate engagements  says the Historian  worthy of an English Prince and an English nobility  Hume v p    Again when the King was on his march to Shrewsbury in a solemn Protestation at the head of his army he recognized the conditions on which he was to receive "aid and relief" from his subjects in general We have here his own testimony to the terms of the As∣sociation the preservation of the established laws a∣mong which those of the existing Parliament were then first expressly named  Ib p  This compact not reduced into writing by the parties like the first was a defensive Asso∣ciation of the People on terms recited to them very  nearly approaching to the form and fully equal to the precision of an Association by parole and to this those of the Royal Party who were absent are to be understood as acceding  THESE transactions are too solemn for us to suppose without something of proof that they were intended for the purposes of mere deception It must be admitted in∣deed that the Declarations of the Heads of Parties some∣times hold forth only specious pretensions to gather strength not their ultimate objects While they seem to rest only on the first their agents by their intrigues and writings are preparing the way for the second but when the primary and secondary partisans of a cause both de∣cidedly look one way we may presume with confidence that the ostensible and real views of the party are the same "During the war" says Coke  Coke's Detection    it is observable that the writers for the King chiefly maintained his cause out of Sir Edward Coke's Pleas of the Crown  But this appeal to his authority goes somewhat farther it amounts to a full though tacit dereliction of the princi∣ples held at Court about seven years before the commence∣ment of the war when Sir Edward Coke's MS of the Pleas of the Crown his Comment upon Magna Charta and on the Jurisdiction of Courts had been seized by order of the Privy Council as dangerous and seditious They had been lately printed by order of the House of Commons and the originals restored to Sir Edward's heir on their petition to the King  THE Parliament at that time without doubt declar∣ed with equal warmth for the Laws and the Constitution in general terms but their literary advocates looked ano∣ther  way It suited neither the measures nor the ultimate object of their principals to fix the attention of the na∣tion upon these repositories of constitutional knowledge "I do not find" says Coke  any who wrote for the Parliament  ever used any one topic  out of the Pleas of the Crown  Coke v p  although that assembly had ordered them to be printed  They probably repented of this order  HENCE it appears that the principles the Royalists set out upon and continued to hold were those of a de∣fensive Association  IT is a question which comes in here not directly in∣deed but collaterally Had the popular part of the Con∣stitution obtained a due degree of strength when this As∣sociation to maintain it in its existing state took place I have lately held the affirmative side of this question but the examination of it is of such a length that it is given in an article of the Appendix  No IV  It may however be established very briefly  à fortiori  upon the authority of Blackstone in his History of the Progress and  Spirit  of the Laws of England with which he concludes his Commentaries Speaking of this period  The King had now  says this learned Expositor  consented to reduce the prerogative to a lower ebb than was con∣sistent with monarchical government  V p th edition    It is a fact that the Bill of Rights left to the Crown more legal prerogatives than Charles then possessed ‖ or the Royalists fought to continue to him and that he would have been very glad after he had been peaceably readmit∣ted to reign upon the terms of his Protestation to have  exchanged the whole mass of the prerogatives which would have been so left him to be a limited King on the footing of that instrument and the place of all those Whigs who at the Revolution thought the liberties of the kingdom sufficiently defined and provided for would in Charles's time have been in the royal camp  IT is remarked in the last Section that a Defensive As∣sociation does not act up to the whole spirit of its princi∣ples It might be expected if this general observation were frequently false it would be found so here The severities the Parliament exercised in their own quarters against the Royalists under the name of Malignants and Delinquents must have thoroughly taught those about the King what  they  were to expect who had actually borne arms against the Parliamentarians if they were finally conquerors Beside the engagements of the King and the power they held in their own hands to enforce them might have seemed to them a sufficient security to the Constitution if that Party were vanquished but they were determined not to suffer him to make peace as a con∣queror Coke lived and acted in those unhappy times his father was a member of the Long Parliament  and one of the first rate  Coke v p    He tells us  I have often heard several of those who followed the King in the war say they as much dreaded the King's overcoming the Parliament as they feared to be overcome by them  Coke v p    This is confirmed in some extracts of James's Papers which I saw about six years ago The Parliamentarians he states to have been in such a situa∣tion that the King was able to have put an end to the  war at once the metropolis lying at his mercy for some time the leading men about him put a negative upon his march to London The superiority of the Royalists over the Parliamentarians until the junction of the latter with the Scotch was incontestible They acted with the humanity of an able swordsman who feeling his advantage over his antagonist whom he is desirous to spare waits to disarm him till he receives a mortal thrust himself We see here that Associations in defence of the constitutional power of the Sovereign are not in their spirit inimical to the Constitution and even that when great danger urges them to secure the full object for which they come forward and it is placed completely in their power they will not at up to the full spirit of their original compact  BUT it may be said that after such a Party is exasperated by resistance and the sufferings they must have undergone in the previous struggle they may be inflamed by victories to forget the moderation which restrained them in their doubtful fortunes and push their vindictive triumphs to extremes They will go further than the limits pre∣scribed in their defensive compacts when every thing is in their power Before we had seen what the extreme of calamity is in the cruelties inflicted upon the French no∣bility and gentry we should have affirmed that the Royalists of England had been irritated as much as the utmost severity of persecution could effect in a christian country and in an enlightened age It may be still said their oppressions and sufferings were great and they felt their with all the violence of indignation  No social intercourse was then maintained between the two par∣ties no marriages or alliances contracted  Hume v p    When  the crimes of the usurpers still further alienated the peo∣ple and their divisions annihilated their power the Royalists suddenly saw themselves masters of the king∣dom almost without an effort of their own As they had all along  affected a greater superiority over their mas∣ters the more they were reduced to subjection  Hume v p    their  implacability  their  fulness of rancour and revenge against all who were engaged in the late war against them  Baker's Chronicle p Car tit    was the object of dread to the latter Yet in the first moment of their return to power they pub∣lished Declarations in all the counties of England which completely bound up their hands from vindictive mea∣sures engagements which they fulfilled with fidelity equal to the conciliatory prudence with which they formed them  The Presbyterians were scarce wet with the tail of this storm none of them except those in sequestered livings being punished either in their persons or fortunes  Coke's Det  v p  I copy the conclusion of one of them that of the nobility and gentry in and about the City of London  It is our hope and prayer that when the building come to be raised it may not like Rome have the begin∣ning in the blood of brethren nor like Babel be inter∣rupted by confusion of tongues but that we may all speak one language and be of one name that all mention of parties and factions and all rancour and animo∣sities may be thrown in and buried like rubbish under the foundation  This Declaration was signed by twenty peers and fifty knights and esquires  THE Royalists in the Convention Parliament of Charles the Second have been censured for restoring him without  conditions and the misconduct of his reign and the subsequent misfortunes of his family have been attributed to this misplaced loyalty Nothing can be less grounded than this censure the Royal prerogative before the breaking out of the Civil Wars had been reduced  to a lower ebb than was consistent with Monarchical Government  Black Com v p    and any new limitations upon the So∣vereign would have been founding a second Republic in the very act of destroying the first The censure implies like∣wise that the authors of the Bill of Rights in the preroga∣tives they left to the Crown laid the foundations of a future tyranny  AFTER the Restoration the Royalists were still united in one compact body In the second Parliament their ma∣jority over their opponents was decisive and beside the whole tide of popular enthusiasm was by this time turned in favour of their principles Now to argue in the spi∣rit of that jealousy with which a certain Party now ver∣bally pretends to consider the multitude of insulated As∣sociations of the gentry and the greater part of the middle class of the people in defence of the Constitution and the constitutional power of the Sovereign  from such a Parliament whose principles were supported by the zeal and ardour of a whole people we might expect all the bad measures which could spring from the con∣fidence of strength and the insolence of victory goaded on by the recent memory of the sternest and severest oppressions the effects of which from the heavy mort∣gages by which compositions sequestrations and dila∣pidations had involved their estates  Coke v p  they must still have continued to feel We might expect to see the  statutebooks almost in every page polluted by some violation of the Constitution  Instead of that what do we find Did they not clear that Constitution of every∣thing which can be shown to be a relic of Norman ty∣ranny and one Act excepted carry it to what Black∣stone has called its theoretical perfection  Commentaries v p It was a great error in the Roy∣alists to have repealed the Act by which Parliaments were to be assembled at stated periods as they did not substitute a more con∣venient term in its stead and the error seems equal in the fra∣mers of the Bill of Rights that they did not apply tile proper re∣dress  Compare the effects of their victory upon the Constitution with that of Republicans real and virtual which preceded it  THE system of Government before the sitting of the Long Parliament stood in the greatest need of a reform the nation felt something beyond the violation of sophis∣tical parities begetting ideal grievances it laboured under great practical oppressions and justly dreaded they would be perpetuated and increased The past conduct of the King could not find a reputable defender in the Com∣mons when they first assembled this assembly contained many excellent men intent on real reformation who were soon able to effect whatever they had intended On his return from Scotland the King had at least an equa∣lity in the Lower House the best men were disposed to stop at the point they had attained the other party backed by the populace of London rendered it impossi∣ble An instructive lesson to those who directly or in∣directly appeal to the populace to effect the best re∣formsalways to be sure to have an effective restraining force in hand to put an immediate stop to the conti∣nuance  of their movements when their purpose is at∣tained  See further on this principle p    I AM approached so near to the Abdication of James that I shall continue the history of the transactions of this Party to that great epoch There we shall find some deviations from the rectitude of their former conduct and a splendid return to it exhibiting a balance much in their favour After the fiction of the Popish Plot had obtained too extensive belief the danger of a civil war appeared as threatening at least as in the year Coke who saw the ferment of the nation in both pe∣riods affirms that at that time  the nation was more fiercely rent in divisions under the names of Whig and Tory than it was before the wars  Coke's Detection v Apology to Reader last page    In the Popular and Republican Party had recourse to the same means of inflaming the Nation which had been practised with so much success in tumultuous Pe∣titioning The end this leads to is always the same be its object what it will namely the constraint of some power which the Constitution leaves free It was now employed to obtain an immediate session of Parlia∣ment The Royalists endeavoured to counteract the effect of this measure by Addresses to the Throne declaring their  abhorrence of those who endeavoured to en∣croach upon the prerogative by prescribing to the King any time for assembling the Parliament  Tumul∣tuous Petitioning is at all times a tacit menace and meant to be so understood At this juncture it was be∣lieved to be the signal of civil war Yet the abhorrers influenced by their recollection of the past and their  fear for the future certainly expressed themselves in words not favorable to the right of orderly Petitioning though they cannot be directly applied against it It may very well be also affirmed that the most zealous friends of the popular branch of the Legislature ought at that instant to have been the most determined opposers of the Peti∣tioners For the King without doubt had at that time fallen upon the plan which with an address fatal to his family he was afterward able to carry into execution that of disgusting the nation with the violence of suc∣cessive Parliaments that he might at last rule without them After the dissolution of his second Parliament it was his constant practice to issue writs for a new House of Commons at a season when the most intemperate of his opponents had the best chance to obtain seats in the Lower House With the same policy when it was assembled he so adjusted his concessions to their violent Motions that the friends of the Laws and Constitution of the kingdom thought them to be so great as to be inconsistent with the internal balance of their system yet they were so limited that he perfectly knew before∣hand they would be rejected contemptuously by Oppo∣sition Besides this apparent facility in making conces∣sions they never could have expected elevated them with the strongest expectations of a final victory over him and led them on from extravagance to extravagance until the Nation warm in the praises of his conciliating moderation became united against them and was not solicitous to see such assemblies meeting again very soon He hardly made a secret of this policy previous to the meeting of his last Parliament  Macph Hist v p  The tumultuous Peti∣tions  of the times increased the violence of the Commons by the assurance of popular support thus assisting the lures and irritations of the Court to hurry them into the snare They ought to have been opposed with the most determinate measures but the zeal of the Addres∣sers pointed out to the King with what rapidity the credit of Parliaments began to fall  IT is thus we see that in the middle of the ferment about the Popish Plot in he dissolved one Parlia∣ment and issued writs for the election of another next day  Macph Hist v p  This could serve only to irritate his opponents sure in the present temper of the lower voters of their reelection and even to increase their number And that he might farther aggravate the factious violence of the new House of Commons by repeated proclamations he hindered their assembling for more than a year after the time originally appointed This gave birth to the Petitions for a session mentioned above That his con∣cessions were constructed with the art I have described in order to discredit Parliament with the sober part of the people will appear from the following account from Hume where we shall see him making a previous expe∣riment upon a large scale of their aptitude for this very purpose before he brings them actually forwards into practice Temple and Shaftesbury were of the Privy Council in when Charles proposed to the Board a scheme of limitations on a Popish successor to defeat the Exclusion Bill From what Temple said on them he was confirmed in his judgment of the sentiments the true supporters of the National Constitution would form  of this sacrifice It was the opinion of that great States∣man  that the restraints were so rigorous as even to subvert the Constitution and that shackles put upon a Popish successor would not afterwards be easily cast off by a Protestant  Hume v p    By this authority Charles was confirmed in his expectation that when three successive Parliaments should have rejected such concessions and the fear of a civil war was hanging over their heads he should have led the sentiments of a misguided and at length confiding people to the point to which he wished to bring them By the opposite declarations of Shaftes∣bury he was likewise assured what powerful assistance he should receive from  his  faction toward the success of his scheme when the President of his Privy Council told him at the Board "that the restraints" which Temple thought excessive  were insufficient and that nothing but the total exclusion of the Duke could give a proper security to the kingdom  Ibid    In this he foresaw the contemptuous rejection of his propositions and his ulti∣mate miserable triumph If I understand what Mr She∣ridan is stated to have said he thinks he has discovered some similitude between the Associators for the defence of the National Constitution in and the Royalists at the period here treated of To discriminate exactly how much of truth and how much of error may enter into that conception would draw me too far but of two points I am confident No system so insidious will be now used to lead us into ruin and that enlightened as we are by the example of the past if such an attempt were made it would not be successful  THERE is also a farther charge which may be brought against the party of the Royalists in Charles the Second's time Shaftesbury to forward his attack upon the Royal power forged the Popish Plot Thus he took away the lives of many innocent men with and some almost with∣out the forms of law The Royalists in the latter end of Charles the Second's reign abused a seeming victory for a short time giving countenance to something too much like an imitation of those shameful hostilities com∣menced by their adversaries but not on so terrible a scale But when a general danger augmented perhaps somewhat by their former intemperance threatened the liberties of the kingdom they stood forth the foremost in their defence the great majority of the Dissenters and Exclusionists had inlisted as the satellites of Ty∣ranny  THE fear of a second Civil War when they had hardly emerged half ruined a very few years before from the first the terrors of legal assassination suspended over their heads and the profound art of Charles the Second led this defensive party at the beginning of this latter period into some bad measures and though we may say of those of their opponents which caused them that they were much worse they detract somewhat from their political merit in being the chief instruments in placing William on the Throne and maintaining him there but not the greater part of it  I BUILD nothing upon a few extravagant declarations of either Party Both of them are to be judged by their practical principles that is those which they display in action or which are displayed in the actions of men  whom they hold out as examples The characters of Parties are also to be estimated like those of individuals from the general tenor of their actions not from acci∣dental errors which are an exception to it and so esti∣mating the Defensive Association to preserve the limited Royal power from the Civil Wars to the Revolution we have seen that it was friendly to the limitations of the Monarchy as well as to the Monarchy itself and twice in fact preserved them at its own proper hazard  I CONCLUDE my remarks on the interesting history of their conduct with the following observationIf this Association had been able not only to preserve the legal power of the King when it was attacked but even to extend it afterwards and had so done it by no means follows that if it had been divided into any great num∣ber of sections as for instance two thousand acting independently of each other without a Council or single person at their head that it would have been able to effect both these purposes or even the first against a con∣centrated Opposition of any degree of power It appears therefore that a Republic of small Defensive Associations such as that which started up in is by no means dangerous But a people so associated is much sooner formed into order to oppose any violence upon their Laws and Constitutions than if the danger comes upon them when totally unprepared  SECTION IV ON THE SPIRIT OF DEFENSIVE ASSOCIATIONS TO MAIN∣TAIN THE LIBERTIES OF THE SUBJECT  FOR the support of the Offensive Association now set on foot examples of others Defensive in their nature and whose transactions are intitled to the veneration of all succeeding ages will certainly at this time be pro∣duced and said to be of the former kind Of these there are three eminent instances in our History The Association of the Barons at Merton that in the time of John and the Coalition of the Whigs and Tories in to invite the Prince of Orange into the kingdom Two of these at feast we might have passed by as not being Popular Associations if it had not been foreseen that it would be necessary to show that all of them were Defensive only and to take care that in all discussions on this subject a Defensive Association of the Nobles should not be brought as an instance of an Offensive Associ∣ation of the People  FROM the definition of the term it appears that the noble and unanimous resistance of the Barons against the intro∣duction of the Civil Law into England in the Parliament at Merton said to have been designed by the Clergy was a Defensive Association not Popular  THE Association of the Barons against John was likewise Defensive At his coronation he had sworn  to maintain the Laws of Edward the Confessor the particulars of which were fallen almost into oblivion A Charter of Henry the First recited and confirmed them Of the contents of this little was known until a copy of it fell into the hands of Stephen Langton Archbishop of Canterbury Favored by opportunity he determined to make use of this fortunate discovery In this he pro∣ceeded step by step with great address One condition imposed by the Archbishop before he gave John an absolution from his excommunication was his renew∣ing his oath to the Saxon Laws he afterward induced him to confirm the Charter of Henry the First At the breaking up of the following Parliament in London the Archbishop called a private meeting of some of the chief of the Barons They were easily induced to promise to take the first convenient opportunity to have this Charter validly established and they retained it in their own hands  The oath to the Saxon Laws was treated by the first Norman Princes as a form only The contents of the Charter of Henry the First were even unknown when the Archbishop produced it to the Barons  There is now likewise discovered says he a certain Charter of Henry the First  and Johnson observes that  he put the Barons in the right way to claim their estates with their writings in their hands    Vindication of  M CH  John now departed on an unsuccessful expe∣dition to his foreign dominions A little time pre∣vious to his return the confederacy having spread wider and comprehending almost all the Barons of England a meeting was summoned by the Archbishop at St Ed∣mundsbury under pretence of devotion It was there agreed that they should prefer their petition for the ac∣tual observance of the Charter in a body and in the mean time take arms to enforce their demands These  particulars being settled going up to the high altar in the church there they swore in their order to ad∣here to each other and not to lay down their arms until they had obtained their demands which after some in∣effectual resistance John was obliged to grant at Runny∣mede This Association sanctified by the forms of reli∣gion was strictly Defensive The Charter had before been admitted by John to be the Law of the Land and even some articles of that instrument which would have increased the value of their baronies but greatly affected the Crown revenues  The different manner in which this Charter affected the powers exercised by the Crown and its legal rights is very singu∣lar The first were greatly restrained many usurpations being cut off but its legal rights were extended by it some lucrative feudal incidents abolished by the former Charters were restored by this  the Barons had the moderation to give up when John could not have succeeded in maintaining them But the faithless character of that Prince induced them to demand the nomination of twentyfive members of their own body as conservators of the articles of the amended Charter  Hume's History and Vindication of Magna Charta Johnson's Works fol  We find here and during the whole of the following reign when the House of Com∣mons first became a constituent part of the Legislature the English Clergy taking part with the majority of the Barons against the Pope and the King who always acted in conjunction  IT must be admitted that this and the former Associ∣ation were purely Defensive They also resembled in nothing a Popular Association they are no more intitled  to be called so than a league of the numerous Princes Dukes and Counts of Germany against the Emperor or the Ecclesiastical Electors would be or the opposition of an hereditary Senate of Nobles against a Prince or the Prelates of a State  AT the Revolution there were two Associations for we may call the invitation of the Prince of Orange an act proving an antecedent compact of that kind and after his landing there was an instrument bearing that name drawn up by Burnet on the requisition of Sir Edward Seymour He is the best reporter of the object of his own paper It contained in few words  an engagement of the subscribers to stick together in pursuing the ends of the Prince's Declaration  Burnet's Hist mo v p    and in defence of his person That Declaration was confined to past violations of law and a requisition of redress by Parliament  And the Prince thereby assured the world that his expedition was intended for no other design but to procure a free Parliament to heal the breaches between the King and his subjects  Macpherson's Hist v p    Nothing is to be discerned here but measures of defence and concili∣ation  It was signed by all who were with the Prince even by many who refused afterwards to take the oaths to the Prince when seated on the Throne  Dalrym Memoirs part p  THE Abdication of James annihilated the greater part of the conditions of the Association by rendering the execution of them impossible but while it subsisted no act  took place which went beyond its primary object and when the members found themselves in circumstances absolutely unprovided for because they could not have possibly been foreseen they acted on the defensive spirit of that engagement which survived the letter At the Revolution  no one part of the Constitution was altered or suffered the least damage but on the con∣trary the whole received new life and vigour  This was the doctrine held by Sir Joseph Jekyl at the Trial of Dr Sacheverel  Appendix No VI    THIS compact likewise was very different from a Gene∣ral Association of the People it was an Association of Heads of Parties or rather of persons holding a power over their followers somewhat between Heads of Parties and Feudal Chiefs For in the confusion of the Civil Wars the tenants and dependants of the greater landed Gentry had been accustomed again to follow them as their mili∣tary leaders The habits and ideas of the military subordi∣nation of a tenant to his chieftain thus revived were not worn out again Much of it was superadded to the in∣fluence of landlord over tenant as we now see it exist This yeomanry therefore did not by the act of follow∣ing their landlords accede to the Association as equal parties therein or as invested with an equal power of deliberation and resolution in claims or measures That great majority of People  the Populace  did indeed while the event of the Revolution remained in suspense de∣clare their wills twice or at least the only part of the lower orders of the kingdom who were enabled by cir∣cumstances to declare it that is the populace of Lon∣don  When James after the failure of his attempt to go over to France returned thither  never Prince re∣turning after victory to his capital was received with louder acclamations of joy  Macpherson and Hume  by the "populace" On the th of December they rejoiced at the appearance of his resumption of the Royal power and on the th of the following February they expressed their second will upon the subject tumultuously assembling in crowds at the doors of the Houses of Parliament loading with imprecations those who adhered to their will of the th of December and its opponents with blessings The Prince of Orange issued a Proclamation to stop these disorderly proceedings although in his favour  When Charles the First returned from Scotland November  he was received in London with the shouts and acclama∣tions of the people and every demonstration of regard and affec∣tion  Hume v On December the th prior to the accu∣sation of the five Members the populace assembled in a tumultuous manner and went to Whitehall to declare their will  that they would have no more porter'slodge but would speak to the King when they pleased  Baker Chron The will of the sovereign populace seems as illinformed and capricious as that of any other precipitate and ignorant despot and that will is the will of the sovereign people whenever it is really and truly taken as they constitute more than nine twelfths that is three fourths of Society    THE manner in which the attack upon our Constitu∣tion of Government will be on this occasion made in writing or speaking is so evident that it is not difficult to guard against it It may be very well foreseen that every Association recorded in our History which has been followed by a happy event will be cited as a precedent in defence of Mr Fox's To prevent such irrelevant instances being brought into  the argument it has been shown that none of these have been General Associations of the People or to which the populace were a party and that none of them have been Associations of acquisition or Offensive  SECTION V ON THE SPIRIT OF OFFENSIVE ASSOCIATIONS OF THE PEOPLE  ON PRETENCES OF RELIGION  I REPEAT what has been laid down in a former Section Those Associations are here termed Offensive the objects of which are some change of the existing Laws whether relating to the governors or the govern∣edand Popular in which the populace become or are invited to become contracting parties  THE objects of suck Associations may be very laxly declared or they may be very accurately limited in the original contract After having given examples of some of the indefinite kind it will be in like manner shown what confidence may be placed in the fidelity of the en∣gagements of limitation held out by others  THE instances of Associations the objects of which have been very laxly defined are so many that it will be expedient to arrange them in some order Those which  have been formed under Religious Pretences and those on the principles of the Rights of Men will form two Sections in the latter no particular account of the late French Revolutions will be entered upon they will be referred to incidentally and by way of illustration only Offensive Associations strictly limited will then become the subject of a separate Section  POPULAR Offensive Associations under religious pre∣tences are first to be here considered I shall begin with the Catholic League in France which was formed in Its nominal object was to annul the famous Edict of Pacification granted by the King to the Protestants in May the same year hence it was an Offensive Associa∣tion It was not until the death of the Duke of Alençon nine years after that it was converted into an instrument to further an attempt to change the succession of the Crown This was the fatal precedent of the Scottish Covenant for the abolition of Episcopacy afterwards adopted in England with some variations By the opera∣tions of these General Associations GreatBritain and France were each divided as it were into two hostile nations shut up in one territory and each of them in∣volved in civil wars in usurpation and anarchy about twenty years This is not the first instance in which the contagious example of a French insurrection has given rise to another in this country threatening to annihilate us as a nation but I hope our remotest posterity will continue to be able to sayIt is the last  THE only remaining compact falling under this divi∣sion here to be noticed is the Protestant Association under Lord George Gordon This likewise was Offen∣sive  as its object was the repeal of certain Acts made in favour of the Romanists  It was the converse or counterpart of the League of the Guises  The plan of his Association also though nominally of a part of the people was effectively general for the proportion of the followers of the Roman Church in Britain in this age to the number of Protestants does not exceed that which took place in King William's time or the hundred and seventyninth part of the people  Da  rymple from William's Papers  The spirit of persecution had long been dormant and it might have been hoped was ex∣tinct for the passions of the populace had not for years been roused against the objects to which they were now turned Yet the direction was given to them with so little preparation as hardly to be the subject of alarm they unexpectedly broke out into insurrection and we saw them masters of the metropolis some days the pri∣sons broken down and their vilest inhabitants turned loose again upon Society or set at their head to plan and lead them on to more dangerous and enormous crimes fires in every quarter of the City and the Bank the depository of the wealth and the column of the credit of the Nation which cannot be shaken without extreme hazard or overthrown without crushing everything be∣neath it in its ponderous ruin hardly saved from their attack when abroad we were at war with four nations without an ally the rest of Europe looking upon our danger with a lowering and inimical neutrality and at home we were almost torn in pieces by our intestine divi∣sions  AS it is not pretended that any amelioration of the spirit and manners of the English populace has taken  place since this dangerous period we may legitimately from this event deduce some conclusions on the state of their dispositions at this juncture directly applicable to our main subject The inveterate spirit of persecuting the Romanists and the principles of Levelling were the distinguishing marks of the Republicans of the last age Little art or endeavour however has been exerted to keep the former alive ever since it began apparently to die away Yet we have seen this spirit as it were start up and threaten the ruin of the State But the embers of Republicanism and Levelling have during all that period been carefully raked up and for fear they should become extinct there were hands which were seen from time to time supplying them with a suf∣ficient quantity of fuel to keep them alive These prin∣ciples have been never suffered to die but lately they have been diffused with the most systematic and malig∣nant diligence and they have been embraced with all the fervor of a new fanaticism by a great number of the populace Where Lord George Gordon made one real enthusiast the Agitators have made fifty And is there no danger to be apprehended from the new Association to which they will all throng to subscribe when that of Lord George Gordon constructed with so much less art and preparation formed of so much feebler materials brought us to the brink of ruin 'It was not' it will be said  the real fanatics that did the mischief but a multitude of miscreants under the mask of the fanaticism of religion  But are the morals of the populace improv∣ed since that time Are not such miscreants mixed among them at least in an equal proportion And if any mask be provided for them will they not make use of it whether it be that of religious or political fanaticism If we urge to you the example of France you will say  No  such violences are to be dreaded from the populace of England they are more enlightened than the French were at the commencement of the Revolutions that the oppressions of the commonalty of France was greatly more than that class of people experience here  As for the lights which they may possess those which have been given them since the Riots of are not of a kind to make them less forward in insurrec∣tion and as for oppression the poor man suffers none here he has been taught indeed to give that name to the whole amount of the taxes as well of those which do not as those which do affect him this total is his re∣puted measure thereof and it has been increased in these last fifteen years Popular tumults are therefore to all appearance more probable more big with the prospect of national ruin now than they were on the day preceding the insurrection of the Protestant Association And when you call upon us to rely upon the good sense of the populace to make a just comparison of their own state with that of the lower classes of other nations by exaggerating the increase of the taxes and declaiming  In these declamations the fact that the mass of the new taxes affects the Upper Orders only is suppressed  perpetually and with extrava∣gance upon it you endeavour to make the result of that com∣parison false on which you call upon us to depend With their minds thus prepared whether the fanaticism infused into them for that purpose be either of the kind called religious or political or both conjointly they generally effect all the destruction in their power and if their association now become general throughout the kingdom their power will have no limit It may be asked now what will become of that position so much insisted on that  nothing but real grievances will drive the popu∣lace  into insurrection and violence that their wrath though often dreadful in its consequences is always just in its cause and commencement that though they may reason ill the effect of the errors of their judgement always passes off in harmless and empty noise and that they never begin to act but from their feelings only which cannot deceive them  In this insurrection we see a strong instance of the falsity of this opinion which many have endeavoured to sup∣port from different motives in order to impress upon us a belief of the infallibility of the people when they come into political action The humane indulgence ex∣tended to a respectable but persecuted sect in was no grievance which the populace felt anything from It even attacked no prejudice which had any active opera∣tion in their minds the day before this Association was planned and the event clearly shows that false abstract principles may be infused into them prejudices long dor∣mant may be reexcited as it were in a moment and in∣stantaneously produce an insurrection which may hazard or destroy the existence of Civil Government  SECTION VI ON THE SPIRIT OF POPULAR OFFENSIVE ASSOCIATIONS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN SO CALLED  EVERY instance in History of the fatal effects of re∣ligious fanaticism has in this age been studiously and invidiously collected and brought forward to public view but those of combinations and associations to ob∣tain Political Equality and to vindicate what are now  called the Rights of Men have been little enquired after and France is very generally supposed recently to have exhibited the first example of the calamities they have produced I have often wondered at the prevalence of this opinion and it would have been fortunate for human kind and for that fine country in particular if it had been true But her fate has resembled too much that of the beautiful and cultivated tracts which lie round the base and ascend part of the sides of Mount Vesuvius the volcano seems extinct for ages the harvest the vine∣yard the farm the villa the palace and every mark of fertility cultivation and splendor seem to have made it their selected spot but the periodical eruption returns and a conflagration sweeps all these beauties from the earth  WHEN the populace is brought into action they will ultimately be governed in their conduct by the most vio∣lent set of principles which has infected any large sec∣tion of them This point is laid down simply now I shall return to the consideration of it But the princi∣ple of the Equality of Right and that understood in its most fatal sense has been long fermenting among and at length infected no small part of the lower classes of Society in Europe While therefore we look upon the late calamities of France as a political phenomenon sin∣gle and unprecedented in its kind when it is only one instance among many we estimate the greatness of our hazard much beneath its magnitude which increases in proportion to the number of such events that have taken place during the period of authentic history and like∣wise with the relaxation of our watchfulness caused by this error which is more singular as our own History  points out to us the danger of England being a second time desolated by the contagion of these principles by an express example This Section I shall divide into Parts each containing the history of one insurrection of this kind with observations  I ON THE INSURRECTION OF THE JEWS BEGUN IN THE REIGN OF NERO AND TERMINATED IN THAT OF VESPASIAN  THE first country which the  supposed  modern metaphy∣sical philosophy of politics deluged with the blood of its inhabitants was Judea Judas and Sadoc says Jose∣phus were the founders of a  school of philosophy new to mankind  Jos Hud p  Their followers were distinguished from the three preestablished sects by teaching the doctrines of Liberty in the abstract THE FREE their attach∣ment to these nothing could move Those who dressed out their panegyrical orations on Liberty with the am∣bitious ornaments of tragical declamation  Ibid p  were sure of an admiring audience Thus we see the orators of the Palais Royal and Copenhagen House had their predeces∣sors in Judea These men consecrated the doctrines of Civil Equality by considering it as a point of religion to acknowledge no lawful superior or King but God  Liberty and Equality are expressed by Josephus by  and  Jos Hud p l p l The latter of these terms has not the ambiguity of the word  Equality  And p    and  then perhaps mankind were first taught the  sacred duties of insurrection  and Ananus the high priest is repre∣sented to have been so much attached to the principle of Equality that he delighted to make it evident in his con∣duct to the most abject His enthusiasm for Liberty ex∣ceeded all measure and he was  an ardent lover of Demo∣cracy  Jos Hud p l  The professors of  this new philosophy  by an insurrection got all the powers of the State into their hands I shall not describe here the crimes of a fero∣cious populace whom they let loose against the upper orders or excited against each other Every successful commotion upon these principles has the same termi∣nationthe massacre or emigration of the Nobles and people of property That of Judea ended finally by the Jews ceasing to exist as a Nation  II INSURRECTION OF THE BAGAUDAE IN THE REIGN OF DIOCLESIAN  BUT France has suffered oftener from the spreading of these principles than any other nation When that country has been greatly exhausted by foreign wars they have repeatedly burst as it were from a latent state into action and added this extreme of calamity to what it suffered before A long series of troubles agitated Gaul from the reign of Gallienus to that of Dioclesian the peasants oppressed with the joint weight of public dis∣tress and  feudal  services  The Gauls in Caesar's time were already divided into three orders of men the Nobles the Druidical Priesthood and the Com∣mon People the last was not of any weight or account in their public Councils Ibid  took arms against their lords  an event says Gibbon which though it is mentioned in a few words by our imperfect writers deserves from its singularity  to be recorded in the history of human man∣ners  The insurgents were called the Bagaudae a name derived from the Celtic word Bagad which signifies a tumultuous assembly  They asserted  continues the historian THE NATURAL RIGHTS OF MEN  but they asserted those rights with the most savage cruelty The Gallic Nobles justly dreading their revenge either took refuge in the fortified cities or fled from the wild scene of anarchy The peasants reigned without controul  Gibbon's Hist v p    As this account was published in it will not be said that the historian has tortured some obscure and brief notices into a parallel with the late Revolutions in the same country The reduction of the Bagaudae was the first exploit of Maximian after his nomination to the Empire by Dioclesian  III INSURRECTION OF THE JACQUERIE IN THE REIGN OF JOHN OF FRANCE  THE next irruption of this kind which laid waste France took place in It resembled that of so much not only in its general character but in par∣ticular circumstances that we seem almost to be read∣ing the same history under different names It was the insurrection of the Jacquerie to whom the modern Jaco∣bins  have succeeded not only in spirit but in title  It must be observed that the name of Jacques in French or Jacobus in Latin is the same as James Hence the terms Jacquerie and Jacobins may be translated "the Society of James or St James" The principle on which this insurrection was formed was according to Gibbon the same as the former  to assert the natural rights of men  In his th note to c he refers for the particulars of it to Froissart I am not in possession of his Chronicle He censures the accounts our best modern writers have given from him I suppose he glances at Hume's History he says the  naiveté  of Froissart's story is lost in them What  naiveté  the relation of the circumstances of the crimes to be related can admit is not very easy to determine However as it taxes these relations with being imperfect I have copied all the circumstances most pre∣cisely delineated from too histories of the same event that of Mr Hume and another given in The Universal History What is taken from the former is to be found in v pp and from the latter v pp the separate accounts are certainly inadequate  after the interval of years  THE war with England had exhausted the resources of France King John was a prisoner in London the Dauphin then of the age of eighteen assumed the exer∣cise of the Government and having obtained a truce of two years of the English he called an Assembly of the States to procure supplies Here he found every Order negligent of the public distress and desirous only to aug∣ment its own power he therefore hastened their separa∣tion At that juncture Charles the Bad King of Na∣varre who had great possessions in France aspired to the Throne We have seen him and his crimes re∣vived in one of his descendants the late Duke of Or∣leans  CHARLES of Navarre had been able to gain to his party the seditious  Prevôt des Marchands  or Mayor of Paris Marcel and that factious populace The latter sent an assassin to murder the Treasurer of France who after∣wards took sanctuary the Regent sent two mareschals to apprehend and execute him the Mayor Marcel upon this raised the populace broke into the apartment of the Prince murdered the mareschals before his face and when he saw him apprehensive of his own fate as a mark of his protection snatched the Prince's hat off and clapped the cap the badge of the faction of Navarre upon his head I must candidly remark here that the colour of this cap was blue  I find in an English History of France that the cap was striped blue and red I cannot settle this important matter It is more to the point to observe from the same History that the palace was forced by citizens each of whom wore the cap as they moved under the order of the Mayor they were probably a part of what has been since called the National Guard belonging to that city Both the Dauphin though extremely young and the King of Navarre possessed great popular eloquence they frequently ha∣rangued bodies of citizens  and not red The Dau∣phinRegent was forced to dissemble his resentment and to take all in good part  AFTER this insult he was detained in a kind of capti∣vity in which state a poison was administered to him by which he lost his hair and his nails This was sus∣pected to have been done by the direction of the King of Navarre  IN the meantime the faction at Paris though seem∣ingly inclined to Charles was more disposed to change France into an effective Republic than to pull down one  King in order to set up another The plan of the leaders of the insurgents of Paris of that time was precisely copied in the first of the new French Constitutions it was  to change the form of the Government to vest the supreme power in the Third Estate and to leave the King his title with little or no authority  This was the Constitution proposed by that metropolis to the other cities but then rejected by them It was not until some little time after that their minds  were elevated to the height of such a Revolution  Dumouriez  But the Regent who had been obliged to temporize and dissemble having been so fortu∣nate as to escape out of Paris and  not to be intercepted in his flight  that capital and the other cities of the kingdom shook off the Royal authority took the Government into their own hands and spread disorder into every Province and the troops left without pay no longer regarded their Officers or were restrained by any discipline from indis∣criminate plunder  YET this devoted country was to be afflicted with the addition of another calamity in weight and magnitude ex∣ceeding the total of what it then suffered this was the in∣surrection of the Jacquerie or peasantry The populace of the cities had found employment for the exercise of the new lights they had obtained in the school of the meta∣physical politicians in the establishing of their new muni∣cipalities or little independent republics destined perhaps if their progress to the perfection of civil society had not received a check to have become the insulated and repul∣sive elements of a prior French Republic one and indivi∣sible The principles of this Association as it has been  already remarked have been assigned by Gibbon who par∣ticularly professes to have examined the original accounts of them himself for the purpose of acquiring light to fix the character of a similar event These insurgents he says "asserted the natural Rights of Man" It has been proved that he ought not to be accused of having sur∣veyed the occurrences of this period with an eye tinctured with the prejudices of the present of having corrupted the faith of history to inflame what is called liberticidal prejudice  THE Members of the Jacquerie did not repel the vio∣lence of the citizens and soldiers as an injury to them∣selves they followed it as an example The object of their fury was the Gentry whom while they were recovering their own rights they upbraided with cowar∣dice for deserting their Sovereign at the battle of Poictiers From this precedent perhaps has arisen the constant sub∣sequent practice of those who are endeavouring to convert a Monarchy into a Republic to mask their first measures under great professions of zeal for the honour happiness and dignity of the Prince  THE castles of the gentry were consumed by fire and levelled to the ground and they were hunted like wild beasts and put to the sword without mercy The sa∣vages proceeded so far as to impale some gentlemen and roast them alive before a slow fire Their wives and daughters were first ravished and then murdered a body of of them broke into Meaux where the wife of the Dauphin with above Ladies had taken shel∣ter the most brutal treatment and most atrocious cru∣elty were justly dreaded by this helpless company but  the Captal de Buche though in the service of Edward yet moved by generosity and the  gallantry of a true knight  flew to their relief and beat off the peasants with great slaughter  Hume vol ii p  There seems even in former ages to have been something fascinating to Englishmen in a beautiful Dauphiness for  the swords which leaped from their scabbards to avenge the looks that threat∣ened her with insult  Letters on the French Revolution p th edit  and violation were those of Englishmen and then national enemies Although the number of this detachment under the Captal was certainly less than Mr Burke seems to have had this anecdote in his eye when he wrote the beautiful passage of which I have given an extract and Bishop Hurd would say that without copying the account he gives us only a copy of the impres∣sion it had made upon him  Hurd's Hor v iii p  The whole of Mr B's observations on the genius of antient chivalry is attacked by Dr Priestley with the excess of chicane and dogmatism "Its spirit" says that writer  nothing but an age of extreme barbarism recommended  Priestley's Letters to Mr B d edit p  He censures its being called by Mr B  the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprize  What it may pass for in the revived school of the Gaulonites I am not very solicitous about their conclusions are not to be trusted one iota further than they are confirmed by induction Yet these are those who tell us that in all questions relating to the interests of society we are to desert Lord Verulam and return to the cobwebs of the old ontologists The philosophy of history must be our guide on these subjects and that was certainly as well known to Raynal as to this other apostle of Civil LibertySpeaking of the cha∣racter of The Portuguese in  Histoire Philos et Polit Amsterdam t p  he asks  Had a nation ever been seen before with powers so apparently inadequate effect such great things What men must the Portuguese of that age have been and what were the extraordinary principles which formed them into a nation of heroes The institution of chivalry one of those which has carried human nature to the highest point of elevation the love of glory substituted in the place of that of our country that spirit purified from the dregs of barbarous ages generated from the vices of the feudal government to redress of  mitigate them Chivalry in that age reappeared on the banks of the Tagus with all the splendor which adorned her birth in France and in England  It was this spirit that supported them to perse∣vere nearly seventy years in their attempts to find a way by sea to the East Indies the discovery of which has been of such important consequence to science and commerce The age of Edward the Third was the most brilliant period of chivalry in England it dis∣plays a multitude of objects which must even now be surveyed with admiration and which we might search for in vain in those which preceded and in many which followed it The spirit of chivalry indeed is not to be regarded in all its parts with a moral but only a political and relative approbation It may be highly serviceable in an age of barbarism or in a commercial period in which luxurious manners and selfishness threaten to become universal In each it is a remedy to some and a counter poison to others of its prevailing vices    ONE observation must be here made on the proximate cause of both these sanguinary insurrections adverting more particularly to the latter  FROM the very nature of the feudal system it is not to be supposed that either of these calamitous periods was dis∣tinguished by any extraordinary oppression of the lower orders by the Nobility or Gentry Previous to the latter the arms of Edward and the intrigues of the King of Navarre had long kept France in a most unsettled state and the Nobility must have felt for a considerable term of time an increasing want of the attachment of their vassals and consequently been obliged to treat them with more than ordinary regard Beside it is by no means certain that in the semibarbarous state in which France was then plunged the burthen of the feudal services exceeded the value of the protection the tenant then received from his lord the latter at that time might be esteemed fully equal to the former As it was a wellknown practice for those who possessed allodial lands or such as were free from feudal  services as our freeholds to convey them over to some neighbouring baron who engaged to grant them back again to the former owner liable to the feudal services of his barony that thus the former independent proprietor by becoming a vassal might acquire a right to the protec∣tion of his new lord Those services he therefore volun∣tarily engaged in because what he gave was not of the same value to him as what he acquired and they were undoubtedly of the kind called privileged or definite he certainly did not thereby submit himself to a state of villenage in gross  IV INSURRECTION UNDER WAT TYLER IN ENGLAND IN THE REIGN OF RICHARD THE SECOND  THESE events in France must in all probability have pro∣duced the first party of  Alarmists  who then held out the danger of these principles getting footing here and it is also probable that there were many English in that age some from that levity which derides all troublesome foresight some not favouring their ultimate success but desirous to promote their own oblique purposes by their temporary extension and prevalence and others who desired to see them adopted in practice to their utmost extent who treated the melancholy declamations of the Alarmists of the Four∣teenth Century on the calamities to be apprehended at home from the effect of the insurrection of the antient Jacobins or Jacquerie upon the minds of the populace with the ridicule the same apprehensions meet in our days the verification their predictions received from the event the politicians described above do their utmost to give to those of their successors and they may succeed In the time of the Jacquerie Edward the Third sat upon the  Throne and the vigour of his administration and the po∣pularity of his brilliant reign must have been a great re∣straint upon those principles from bursting forth into pre∣sent action but the distemper of the minds of the popu∣lace though latent was probably spreading during its lowering decline It broke out in the minority of Richard Seditious orators were not then wanted to propagate the sacred duty of insurrection the name of one of them is handed down to us John Ball a priest went about the country inculcating on his audience  the equal right to liberty and to all the goods of nature the tyranny of artificial distinctions and the idea of primitive equali∣ty  Hume's Hist vol iii p    To borrow a metaphor from a modern writer of great eminence it was thus a mine was dug to blow up civil society a poll tax had been granted by parliament and an insult offered by an abandoned collector to the daughter of a blacksmith set fire to the train which led to it The populace of Essex Kent Hertfordshire Sussex Surrey Suffolk Norfolk and the counties of Cambridge and Lincoln immediately flew to arms and before the Government had the least warning of the danger the disor∣der had risen beyond controul or opposition the most audacious and criminal of their leaders assumed the feigned names of Tyler Straw Carter or Miller  by which they were fond of denoting their mean origin  Thus those who borrow their principles from France now bor∣row from the same country the gross name of  Sans Culottes  In all insurrections of this character the populace are con∣stantly actuated by one motive "the purpose of levelling all mankind" the means too by which its end is pursued are always the same  the insurgents committed the most  outrageous violences on such of the Nobility or Gentry as had the misfortune to fall into their hands  and  favoured by the city rabble they broke into London ****murdered the Primate the Chancellor and the Treasurer ****cut off the heads of all the Gentry whom they laid hold of expressed a particular animosity against the lawyers and pillaged the warehouses of the rich merchants  even the Widow of that revered hero the Black Prince could not escape from their insolence and outrage  some of them to shew their purpose of levelling all mankind forced kisses from her  Hume's Hist v p c    whose head they also broke in a tyrannizing frolick  Foulis Hist of Plots p    Is the sable warrior fled  Thy Lord is gonehe rests among the dead  GRAY  This event being recorded in our own History I shall be more particular in my observations upon it  THE construction and mode of working that machinery which is to disorganise Society we see was not then totally unknown and the means to diffuse constitutional infor∣mation employed in that period were the same as are now in practice if we except the press that most powerful en∣gine to promote the best and the worst ends and on the balance for a certain period after the commencement of the attack a formidable addition to dangers of this kind The minds of the populace were regularly prepared for insurrection in the manner described and the principle of equalizing then copied from the French was the pre∣disposing cause of this unhappy and sanguinary commo∣tion The criminal insolence of a taxgatherer repelled  by an immediate murder was the occasion or premature signal only which brought this spirit into action not the primary origin of the series of events which then com∣menced  THE principles of sedition preached by John Ball have a singular similitude to those now solicitously propagated We are able to trace in them the great outline of those laid down in the advice of Mr Barlow to the Privileged Orders This is evident in the account given of the former from Hume It is worth the while only to instance particularly one of these points of resemblance which is curious and striking Mr Ball in his Homilies on the Rights of Man preached on "their equal title to all the goods of nature" and Mr Barlow that  every man is born with an impre∣scriptible claim to a portion of the elements which por∣tion is termed his birthright  Second edition p iii    We see both of them lay down the same doctrine in the same guarded manner half holding forth to the populace and half keeping back an expectation of an equal division of lands This Century had not the honour of first discovering this fine principle of tribunitial morality in the classical records or of the re∣invention of it  THERE seems to me little reason to ascribe the miseries in which this insurrection involved England at that parti∣cular point of time to any other cause than the contagion of the principles which had prevailed in France some time before I shall however state and consider what may be said against this  MR HUME joins another with it on the authority of Froissart  that personal slavery was then more general in England than in any other country in Europe  He himself in some places has censured that Writer as falling into many errors in point of fact but there is one circumstance which shews that the number of slaves by which I suppose villeins in gross  Transferrable by sale or deed from one owner to another  to be meant must in that age have been very greatly reduced The influence of the clergy over the minds of the people had at that time suffered a shock which it never recovered On this something more particular will be said hereafter  Appendix No II  Hence the greater part of every Revolution they were to bring about in the relative state of the different classes of Society had been already effected Now the total abo∣lition of this species of slavery was completed in Eng∣land and that by the exertions of the clergy before the Reformation for Sir Thomas Smith who was Secre∣tary to Edward the Sixth says that in all his time he never knew any villein in gross throughout the realm  for he tells us that the holy fathers monks and friars had in their confessions and especially in their extreme and deadly sickness convinced the Laity how dangerous a practice it was for one christian man to hold another in bondage so that temporal men by little and little by reason of that terror of their con∣sciences were glad to manumit all their villeins  The clergy esteemed it despoiling the Church to manumit their villeins regardant of whom some few were left at the Reformation but the question is here of villeins in gross or the extent of personal slavery    It seems therefore reasonable to suppose the effect of  their exhortations being at all times proportioned to their ascendancy over men's minds in general that they made the most rapid progress in this work and had performed the greatest part of it before their influence was much de∣clined or before the accession of Richard the Second nor are we to ascribe those great insurrections to perso∣nal slavery at a time in which it was greatly dimi∣nished which are not to be found in the time it was most prevalent  FURTHER to shew that nothing is contained in this instance tending to demonstrate that a calamity of the like nature is probable at present it will be said that  these were the excesses of a barbarous age but that the diffusion of light in Society has humanized the manners of every class of mankind and that this is particularly the case of England at this period and although in the Fourteenth Century the populace both here and in France were equally involved in darkness and led with the fame facility into atrocious crimes that the lower orders in this kingdom have in the former of these respects and consequently in the latter in this age a relative superiority over their neighbours which they were by no means entitled to boast of in the age of Edward the Third The conclusion of this is obvious that a danger so probable then as justly to have been the subject of alarm must be totally visionary now  BUT it cannot be admitted that the populace of Eng∣land were then so totally involved in ignorance as this objection supposes for whenever a certain portion of knowledge on any one subject becomes generally diffused  among the upper classes of a State their inferiors will soon become possessed of that part thereof which their relative situation permits them to acquire The increase of the information of the former becomes disseminated among the latter by the middle class conversing ordina∣rily with both And the feudal system tended to insure this in the age which is under consideration not only by the frequent attendance of the vassals in the courts of their Lords but by the multitudes of retainers which their hospitality their ostentation or their love of war induced them to live surrounded by These originally taken from occasionally mixing with and ultimately returning to the body of the common people diffused among them the outline of every new opinion as soon as it was esta∣blished The propagation of new ideas throughout the whole of Society was not much less rapid then than it is now much of the effect of the discovery of printing be∣ing counterbalanced by the change of customs in this par∣ticular and thus perhaps the feudal system contained within itself the seeds of its own decline  NOW from a detail of numerous circumstances pre∣served to us is history it appears that the upper classes in the reigns of Edward the Third and his successor were far advanced in general knowledge and particularly in that of political commercial and constitutional prin∣ciples insomuch that it seems that the nation was in these respects in a retrograde state from the age of Edward the Third to the accession of the Tudors and that it did not reacquire its former point of advance upon the whole until the reigns of the first Scottish Princes  Appendix No II    In the history of France for the same period I recol∣lect none of these circumstances and I think it would be in vain to search for them for the greater part of these improvements were most probably so early called forth in England by the institution of a House of Commons re∣latively new and then beginning to produce its effects on the spirit and ideas of the nation  OF this knowledge according to what is observed above every class of the nation must have imbibed its share according to its powers of absorption the genius of the age prevented its being confined If therefore we compare the English populace of that period with that of France as great a superiority at least must then be al∣lowed to them in useful knowledge as can be admitted now but the event shewed that the difference in that age was not enough to protect this nation from the expe∣rience of many and the hazard of all the miseries which had recently overwhelmed France And as that diffe∣rence is not increased it is a folly which tends to the last extremity of national ruin to rely upon it more firmly now  THERE is another point of view likewise in which the insurrection of the Fourteenth Century requires conside∣ration The late subversions of the Governments of Hol∣land and of France shew us that there is almost as much to fear as to hope from regular troops and if we look to a force on which we can place unlimited confidence in opposition to such an insurrection at this juncture from the revolution which has taken place in the state and manners of Society we shall see that force greatly weak∣ened In the feudal ages the upper and opulent classes  were chiefly military men Hence though the encoun∣ter was terrible they finally prevailed by the advantage of discipline and military habits On a late occasion from the decay of them we have seen the gentry and no∣bility of France unable to make a stand and swept away almost without resistance a country where the educa∣tion of a camp was much more general among the supe∣rior orders than in Britain Admit now the chance of insurrection to be less than here stated the danger to be apprehended is from the chance of attack and the weak∣ness of the means of defence jointly if that chance de∣crease and the strength of defence decrease in the same proportion the danger of the State remains still the same  OTHER INSURRECTIONS TO ASSERT THE RIGHTS OF MANT  SOME other insurrections will be here mentioned that a general conclusion may he drawn from the whole of them but with little detail of their particular inci∣dents  IN the feeble reign of Henry the Sixth Cade raised a formidable commotion under a pretence of a Reduction of taxes and a Reform in the State but no trace of the Levelling principle is to be found in his Declarations or his conduct an article in his Manifesto in favour of the old against the new nobility seems even in the most dia∣metrical opposition to it and he is generally esteemed to have been an instrument of the Duke of York This is noticed as the only instance I recollect in the History of this country of the more dangerous insurrections of the populace which was not founded on the doctrine of the Equality of the Rights of Man  AFTER the death of Isabella of Castile in the Regency of that kingdom was disputed between her hus∣band Ferdinand of Arragon and the Austrian Princes During the following sixteen years a kind of turbulent Interregnum prevailed in Spain with intervals of regu∣lar government The Royal power being by these vicissi∣tudes weakened a democratic faction arose considerated under the title of the  Germania  the Brotherhood or Association of the People It involved Spain in discord and bloodshed for nearly two years The Progress of Civil Society toward anarchy in that time in the king∣doms of Spain was nearly the same as what we recently saw it in France in the same period it was advanced so far that two clothworkers and a tanner ruled the debates of their Third Estates  Further particulars of this insurrection are given in the APPEN∣Dtx these disorders having passed into Germany and thence hither    TO the stern government of Henry the Eighth in England succeeded the feeble minority of Edward the Sixth and the feeble Protectorate of his uncle the Duke of Somerset continually traversed by his factious bro∣ther and his intriguing successor Popular commotions arose in several parts of the kingdom some insurgents took arms on account of religion others were what Ba∣ker calls "Commonwealth Mutineers" The object of the three greater bodies was to form a junction one of them declared for no King the destruction of the nobi∣lity and gentry and holding a  Parliament in commotion  which should begin at the South and North Seas of England Another for no Gentry no Lawyers no  Judges no Justices no Inclosures  Bakers Chronicle  It was with diffi∣culty and great exertion that two of these bodies were se∣parately conquered on which the third dispersed If the projected junction had taken place it would most pro∣bably have involved the whole kingdom in a desolation equal to that in which the Jacquerie involved France  ONE consequence is plainly deducible from a view of all these accounts conjointly that the executive power of the Sovereign can never be both suddenly and greatly weakened or relaxed below its accustomed tone without exposing Society to the hazard of that most dreadful of calamities the tyranny of Levelling principles or those of Equality for the latter term bears no other sense in the conception of the multitude and is intended to convey this to them by the great majority of those who affectedly dwell upon it This spirit is ready to break out on all such occasions and this we have seen it do when John of France was a prisoner to a foreign ene∣my when Charles the First and Louis the Sixteenth were prisoners to their own subjects during the feeble and distracted minorities of Richard the Second and Ed∣ward the Sixth and in the effective Interregnum follow∣ing the death of Isabella of Castile  ALTHOUGH this is the most permanent and gene∣ral of the irregular passions acting upon the minds of the populace it sometimes gives place to others which if they happen to be predominant at a time when the Royal power is suddenly diminished the former will not appear in action but the latter will  produce the same effect Thus in Ireland when the vigo∣rous and in some instances perhaps the arbitrary admini∣stration of Lord Strafford was removed and it be∣came evident that Charles the First was a King in came only and that his government had very little effective power the long suppressed resentments of the Irish against the English and their ferocious bi∣gotry broke out in the Irish Rebellion and Massacre This seeming exception gives an indirect but strong support to one of the propositions on which the pre∣ceding conclusion is founded But to confine ourselves to the principles of the Commonwealth Mutineers"  HENCE it may be laid down as a general fact that when the power which keeps the lower people in subordi∣nation be it equal to or more than the degree every good man would wish to have permanently established in a State be of a sudden greatly diminished in∣surrections of this kind will be the consequence of it for if it be justly said that Governors are always endeavouring to increase their coercive power yet when we see it for a considerable term of years stationary notwithstanding that perpetual effort we know that the spirit of resistance of the People in that generation is precisely equal to the whole of that power Diminish the latter greatly and the elasticity of the former will cast the remaining weight entirely off Such diminutions must be made by degrees and an at∣tentive and accurate administration of the powers left will supply the place of the ruder compression that is removed until the people become accustomed to enjoy their new degree of liberty with temperance then it becomes capa∣ble of a second further extension and not before In the  progressive growth of the British Constitution we see an illustration of this we may describe it in the same terms in which Tacitus describes that of the Roman Empire from its origin to its highest point of grandeur  Octingentorum annorum fortunâ disciplinâ compages haec coaluit  This noble edifice was erected by the fortune and virtue of eight hundred years Every course of masonry was suffered to settle and consolidate as it was carried up The period indeed was long but in ages of barbarism and semibarbarism this work will and perhaps ought to proceed very tardily  IT follows from all the instances given in this Sec∣tion that offensive popular Associations on principles called those of the Rights of Men have always been at∣tended with the most tragical consequences and it must be added that this has not arisen solely from accident or the circumstances of the times in which the experi∣ment has been made but from the principle itself which is contrary to the legitimate consequences of the laws of human nature It rests to be shewn that on whatever ground a strong Offensive Association shall at this time begin to act it will be presently lost sight of and this substituted in its place  SECTION VII ON OFFENSIVE ASSOCIATIONS THE OBJECTS OF WHICH ARE LIMITED  THE objects of these Associations' it will be said  were extreme and mostly indefinite Had their Leaders at the beginning laid down certain ends or limits the cala∣mities  above described would never have happened or at least the greater part of them would have been avoided their operations would have ceased as soon as these fixed points had been attained and to reason of the present timeSuppose the worst suppose even that there should exist a Party in Great Britain with whom the tie of al∣legiance is of no force and that they might be looked upon in the same light as a body of foreign enemies within the realm yet from foreign enemies we should entertain a full expectation of peace or cessation of ho∣stilities on our performance of such conditions as they propose and we accede to And shall we entertain of Englishmen doubts that would be injurious to a fo∣reign enemy Can we think so ill of our country∣men Have they rejected every principle analogous to the Law which binds hostile nations which can preserve the good faith of  hostile parties  to each other  IT may be the belief of the majority of the original Leaders of an Offensive Association that they ought and it may be their determination that they will act up to their engagements but if they be at the head of a Party combined on the principles taught as the Rights of Man such Leaders may  bona fide  make the attempt to act up to their original Manifesto but the probability runs very strongly against their being able to effect their purpose for whatever principles they may set out with the ex∣treme and most violent that their lower adherents shall have imbibed prior to their Association or that they shall pick up in the course of the struggle will most pro∣bably be those ultimately acted upon  I SHALL here show the reality and magnitude of this danger from the examples of the most enlightened na∣tions and in their most enlightened periods It must be on this occasion supposed that it will not be disputed that when the heads of a Party declare that they will preserve any one part of a Constitution in its existing state they thereby impose limits upon their own operations and that as much reliance may be placed on those they im∣pose upon themselves in the course of action as if they had laid them down immediately before they began to act To attempt to distinguish between the validity of the two securities would be to make a distinction without a dif∣ference unless it be contended that when the Leaders of such a Party have begun their series of measures they lose entirely the power or the with to observe their en∣gagements but an opponent who shall rest upon this concedes the whole argument  THE object of Mr Fox's Association is clearly limited It is to continue in force until two Acts of Parliament named therein be repealed and the subscribers as Asso∣ciators are to pursue no other point But we have had the calamity to see a very recent and terrible example of the failure of an engagement defined with as much pre∣cision as that now held out to us and which was con∣tracted with a more awful solemnity It was on the th of July that M Lamourette Bishop of Lyons moved in the National Assembly  That all those who hold in equal detestation a Republic and two Chambers and who wish to maintain the Constitution as it is  Rise  The words were scarcely pronounced when  the whole Assembly by an instantaneous impulse rose from their scats The two parties advanced and em∣braced  each other and solemnly protested their adhe∣rence to the Constitution  New Annual Register His p    It is of consequence to add that this motion was made  at the moment M Brissot ascended the tribune to pronounce a discourse on the means of securing the State against all its enemies  It was at the very crisis of the Revolution the army of the Prussians and Austrians were advancing in France no adequate force was prepared to oppose them and when such a man brought forward such a discussion at such a time no doubt can be entertained that the Leaders and the body of his Party were present and all present con∣curred in this solemn Protest It was on the th of the following month the Tuilleries were attacked and the King deposed Brissot Louvet and Barbaroux in their public speeches and writings asserted that this Revolu∣tion was effected by them and their associates to esta∣blish a Republic and that the day originally fixed on to carry it into execution was the th of July  Moores Journal v p  twentytwo days only after this public declaration Now if twentytwo days was a space of time long enough for arranging the plan of the insurrection and making the necessary preparation for it the Brissotine Party must almost instantly have gone from the making this Protest to the direct violation of it If the period were so short that they cannot be supposed at first to have expected to be able to bring about so great an event in so little a time after the first conception of it which seems almost certain then the conspiracy existed at the time this solemn en∣gagement was entered into and the only object of the Republican Conspirators in taking the Protestation was to cast a necessary veil for a few days over those measures  they were pursuing which brought such dreadful cala∣mities upon themselves and their country  THUS the Declaration against Republicanism was vio∣lated the remaining half of the Protestation continued uninfringed some little time longer The National Con∣vention containing many of the members who had taken this Protestation sat for a short and sanguinary period as one Assembly the members whereof were chiefly occu∣pied in mutual proscriptions It then dissolved one third part of itself filled up the vacancy and divided into two Chambers Such is the lesson recent experience holds forth to us on the faith that is to he put in the engagements of this kind solemnly entered into by the Leaders of a People enlightened by the torch of Philoso∣phy kindled at the sacred and eternal fire on the altar of Liberty and Equality These men these means this act have been defendedDefended did I say The enthusiasm of the Republicans of England has applauded them be∣yond every example the annals of public virtue present us with in ancient or in modern ages They will be ad∣mitted parties to Mr Fox's Association and become by their subscriptions the guarantees of its limitations And will not these idolizers of the violation and the viola∣tors of one of the most solemn compact on record emu∣lously follow the example they adore At the commence∣ment of this year a second solemn farce the same in form but opposite in its engagements was exhibited at the com∣memoration of the beheading of the King the members of the two assemblies swore detestation to Royalty This oath certainly cannot be supposed to have any tendency to accelerate or retard its restoration  WE now come to the examples of the insufficiency of these limiting clauses contained in our own History but to this the following observation must be premised on the nature of limitations in general The object of an Offensive Association may be to effect alterations in the State or in Religion severally or in both conjointly and in the two first cases the Associators may pledge themselves to the entire conservation of the one but fix no limits to the extent of the alterations they propose in the other Thus an Association may refuse to lay down any limits to the alterations they wish to effect in the State but by express declaration engage to make none in the national religion This was the state of obligation in which the Leaders of the Long Parliament and their ad∣herents placed themselves before the Civil Wars com∣menced for it has been seen before that they refused to define the extent of their proposed alterations in the State on the King's requisition and that in the justification of their conduct and views they never referred to that repository of law and constitutional knowledge the works of Sir Edward Coke their object in the State was there∣fore indefinite and as such has been before considered but this Association was strictly limited with respect to changes in religion the fidelity with which they adhered to those limitations will presently be examined  THOSE who at that time endeavoured to bring about alterations in the existing Laws inimical to the constitution of its government  The period when this accusation was with certainty applicable to the Parliament of has been before fixed It was when they demanded the military force of the kingdom should be put into their hands by law after they had obtained a Constitution of Government more popular than that delineated by the Bill of Rights  drew large  parts of the nation to associate with then having previously defined in express terms certain points thereof which they would maintain and defend in their existing state The conditions of such Associations shall be here produced and the entire breach of them shewn and from a comparison of the manners and morals of the nation at that time and the present juncture it will be likewise proved that before the events to be related took place the apparent danger of a flagrant violation of these limits in the former period was much less than that of a like breach of the restraints the Associators of the present day have imposed upon themselves  IT was between the d and th of May that the House of Commons entered into a vow and Protesta∣tion  in the presence of God to maintain the true Protestant Religion  expressed in the doctrine of the Church of England  Coke's Detection v Hume v p Coke p repeating the same words adds  which passage Mr Whitlock in his Memoirs p has left out  It is however cited in a public declaration of the University of Oxford "Reasons c against the Covenant " June page    The Lords concurred with them in taking this Protestation but in opposition to that House the Commons by their single authority or∣dered it to be subscribed by the whole nation under the penalty to such as should refuse of being declared unfit for any office in Church or Commonwealth and being deemed malignants and disaffected  Baker's Chronicle p  The opposition of the Peers to the general subscription shews it to have been brought forward by the most active opponents of the Court  THIS engagement became at length an obstacle to the Parliamentarians when they wanted to obtain the assistance of the Scotch in the depressed situation to which they were reduced In September or in little more than two years they subscribed the Solemn League and Covenant whereby they engaged to establish Presbyte∣rianism in England Vane had indeed the address to have the Article on this subject drawn so that it did not absolutely bear the sense the Scots put upon it but the Parliament executed it in that sense and the concurrence of both the contracting parties thereto establishes what is to be received as the meaning of the ambiguous phrase he inserted  THIS engagement the Parliament subscribed them∣selves and they ordered it to be received by all who liv∣ed under their authority It may be pretended that this change was justified by a change of religion in the body of the people but this is a position which cannot be supported It is not digressing from my purpose to shew this for it proves that a cabal of leading men may draw a great part of the nation into an Association with them one condition of which shall be to preserve inviolate some institutions for which the people entertain the highest reverence and obtaining political power by this means the Junto or a part of them shall convert that very power to effect the abolition of what they originally engaged to defend  AT the meeting of the Long Parliament the Puritans were by no means the majority of the nation  Hume v p  There  was not a less proportion of the Sectaries in the House of Commons than in the kingdom at large and the Prote∣station in could not have been voted by an Assem∣bly where the majority or even a numerous and active Party were of that description The doctrine of the Pu∣ritans had taken root before and its followers were in∣creasing but when it attained its utmost growth under the shelter of that Party who began as reformers and ended as subverters of the legal Constitution they still continued to be a minority in the nation and the Cove∣nant was imposed by force or the fear of force upon the majority of the people Of this we have the best cotemporary evidence that of the Dissenters themselves Before the commencement of the Civil War it was one of their leading tenets that the individuals of every con∣gregation had  jure divino  a right to elect their own mini∣ster but after they had begun the operation of ejecting the episcopal Clergy the Assembly of Divines found it necessary to give up the divine right of election" at which time Emanuel Knutton expresses his fervent gra∣titude to our blessed Parliament and reverend Synod" who took  the care to send zealous and godly ministers to  vacant parishes The necessity of the concessions of the Assembly and the joint care of that body and of the Parliament is clearly shewn by Needham who tells us that if the people had then been permitted to chuse their own pastors  the godly and wellaffected would have the least stroak in the choice  And he adds that  if there be no other supplies made for parishes but such as the  parishioners cordially reverence and affect  the man to be chosen in most parishes would be  a man in a surptice with a commonprayer book c  Great Accuser cast down p See Clergyman's Vade Mecum preface p d edit    Hence  we see that the Presbyterian discipline was imposed upon the majority of a reluctant people by a Party who had drawn them in to associate with them by taking a solemn  Protestation in the presence of God to maintain the religion expressed in the doctrine of the Church of so England  THE Protestation as we have mentioned above was superseded by the Solemn League and Covenant the preamble of which professes all regard to the honour and happiness of the King's Majesty and his posterity and the true public liberty safety and peace of the kingdoms And in the body of it it is declared that the parties thereto had  no thoughts or intentions to diminish his Majesty's just power or greatness  Thus the former limits to the projected reforms securing the national reli∣gion were removed but new ones were entered into re∣lating to the civil state to preserve the just power of the King undiminished  THESE were no more adhered to than the former every Party to bring about an alteration in the Law by their personal interposition  A Party or section of a Party is said personally to interpose in the State when they assume functions contrary to the spirit of the laws as when they attempt to overawe the Legislature or assume legislative power or when a constituent part of that power assumes to be the whole This is opposed to their action or interposition ac∣tording to  the cusoms or Letter  the Constitution of Government  contains men of three de∣scriptions its moderate members its warm members and its fanatics In the period of our Civil Wars the power had early shifted from those of the first to those of the second description of the Parliamentarians and was  ultimately seized by those of the third We have seen the same progress of the devolution of power take place in the French Revolutions and such transitions are not to be looked upon as singular incidents attending these two turbulent periods but as general consequences occurring in every such crisis of a State and in both these cases those Leaders into whose hands the power successively fell never persevered any longer in the preservation of the limits they had themselves laid down to their enter∣prize than until it became their interest to pay no regard to them The only use such stipulations seem to have served is this they enabled their projectors to acquire or retain the immediate possession of power and by that power they compelled a reluctant people to follow or to submit to them in their successive violations of their Compacts  As the terms of the first Association  to maintain the true Protestant religion  as expressed in the doctrines of the Church of England  were fulfilled by abolishing them by law and by the introduction of the doctrines of the Church of Scotland instead of them so the Solemn League and Covenant next entered into professing in its preamble all regard to the honour and happiness of the King's Majesty and his posterity was fulfilled by those into se hands the military and civil power of the League bad now fallen by murdering him and expelling his family out of the kingdom Europe then first beheld the fatal example of regicide committed with the moc∣kery of the forms of law and by the establishment of an  ex posit facto  jurisdiction The first example of a Revo∣lutionary Tribunal is discovered also in the High Court of Justice which sentenced the King Cromwell continued  the practice in cases he called Treason superseding the trial by jury to the preservation of which the parties to the latter Association or Covenant must be conceived to have sworn as a leading part of the  true public liber∣ty  THERE is but one step further to go in this account A Party may begin with limits to be violated the first moment an iniquitous interest prompts them so to do and end with proscriptions Mr Hume has observed that had the Restoration been postponed a little longer  there was just reason to dread all the horrors of the ancient massacres and proscriptions  Hist v p    Coke has informed us that an accusation was brought against the Royalists which cannot be supposed calculated for any other pur∣pose than to prepare the way for such an execrable mea∣sure and to shelter it under a verbal justification after it was executed When the degradation of Richard Crom∣well had taken place the Council of Officers at Wal∣lingford House published a Remonstrance in which they charged the Malignants or Royalists  that they had printed lists and marked for destruction the godly especially the King's judges  Coke v p    and in an historian of that time we find that it had been debated in a Council of War  to massacre and put to the sword all the King's party The question was carried in the negative but by two votes  Walker's History of Independency part p From Sedg∣wick's Justice upon the Army's Remonstrance I copy this from a quotation I conclude the Council to have been that held at Wal∣lingford House    In Oliver's Parliament which met  in a Bill had been brought in to decimate the Royalists  Thurl  e's StatePapers v p Many will think perhaps such atrocious plans were never agitated in Britain the following wellauthenticated anecdote joined with the manner in which it is related shows this supposition not to be founded It has been before noticed that the father of Coke the historian was a leading Member of the Long Parliament He was expelled the House as a Malignant and afterwards engaged in a plot against the Protector to which the brother of the Writer  young about years old raw and of little experience  was privy The father and the youth were both seized at Yarmouth the latter  confessed all he knew to the Governor it seems they had put burning matches between his fingers  v p that is to extort evidence from him against the life of his father But this fact Coke passes over without the least observation of its being a tyrannical cruelty either singular in itself or even when joined with the con∣sideration of the rank and youth of the person if it had been extra∣ordinary in either of these respects a Writer would have noted that circumstance when practised upon his brother    WHEN the history of the successive French Revolu∣tions shall come to be carefully examined it will be sup∣posed very probable that many of the wounds which have been inflicted upon France were made by daggers forged in this country In the following case some doubts may be entertained The project to establish a fingle National Assembly instead of two Houses was attempted by the Commons before the Civil Wars but they did not succeed in it Foulis informs us that the Commons  had another mode to drive on their designs of altering the Government of England They put several agitators to draw up a Petition that the Peers who were agreeable to them would sit and vote with the Commons to the intent to have but one  House  Foulis Hist of Plots p    This Petition was accordingly framed and by the Commons it was presented to the House of Lords This might be the remote origin of the National Assem∣bly or both the English Commons and the  Tiers Etat  in France might have poached for a precedent in the Memoirs of the Jacquerie  THERE are desperate diseases certainly in the politi∣cal as well as the natural constitution which require and may justify very hazardous applications but these are to be attempted only when it is evident that the case will terminate fatally before a course of ameliorating alteratives can produce their effect A vigorous remedy may also at one time be applied with little hazard at another that hazard will be much increased We must always endeavour to form a true estimate of the  alue in use  of our object stripped carefully of those gay ac∣coutrements and tinsel with which imagination dresses out all its favourites This value we are then to com∣bine with the probability of attaining our object assign∣ed as truly as we can This result is what a disciple of Simpson or De Moivre would call the expectation of gain from the experiment We are then to view the real magnitude of the evils this object may draw after it examining them with a mind equally clear from all pre∣vention This amount also is to be combined with the chance of their happening to find the expectation of loss the two expectations are to be balanced against each other and we are to determine in favour of the greater unless any evil may follow from the failure of the first attempt In that case having estimated its mag∣nitude  and chance or what is above called its expectation that expectation will be also a legitimate deduction from the former balance of gain if any had been found  To give an example of this processIn a Society like our own let the success of an assigned alteration in the State be extremely probable the advantage very great let there be a small chance that the progress of alteration will not stop at the acquisition intended but that it may go on until a state of anarchy takes place and let it be proposed to determine whether this alter∣ation is to be attempted Here we mull reason thus Anarchy is the arbitrary power of all over each indivi∣dual or the tyranny of all but one over every one It is an evil in Society like annihilation to the individual infinite and the chance of coming into this state being finite though small the expectation thereof or the quantity of evil to be set against the good exceeds in magnitude any finite good which can be assigned  The despotism of  one  over all may undoubtedly be likewise denominated an infinite evil in Society and no evil to arise from the hazard of life  in fair war  is equal to any individual's private share thereof But mathematicians have made a distinction in the orders of infinites they have their first their second and higher orders While the tyranny of a Despot is of the first or lower order that of Anarchy resembles the second As I have borrowed their mode of argument hare and they are the legislators of their own terms they must be used It might otherwise have been said that the despotism of an individual is an evil of an indefinite magnitude supposing the Tyrant only to will and his satellites to be his passive instruments Yet in this case let there be inhabitants in a State each of them has the unlimited will of one only to apprehend but let the Society be stung into a state of anarchy every man now will have tyrants more    But to return to the history which led to this train of general reflection These temperate men who saw the necessity of a great amelioration of the system of existing Government in in order to restore to the Legisla∣tive Estates the actual exercise of their legal functions though they had perhaps the most efficient influence in impressing the first movement toward that end found themselves from a concurrence of various causes actu∣ally not able to stop it when it was gotten even beyond that point at which they wished things to become station∣ary When the inclination of a plane exceeds a very small degree a heavy body to which the slightest revo∣lutionary movement is given is urged along continually as it moves by an accelerating force which soon becomes indefinitely greater than that which was applied at first to put it into motion and nothing will stop it at the limit originally determined for its progress but some firm obstacle placed beforehand at that point of the line of its direction And in any tolerable system of Govern∣ment men ought to be absolutely certain that they shall be able to stop at such an assigned point before any alteration be attempted If mo e than a little be required to be done the work should be subdivided and under∣taken at intervals the first step in the progress may be so taken as to ensure some little facilities to the second but not to precipitate it To use for a moment out pre∣sent political neologism the Parliament in accele∣rated that revolutionary movement which they ought to have restrained the ferment of the people which ori∣ginally perhaps required tempering was increased by eve∣ry art They greedily acquired a power too great for the weight to be removed and they were not masters of its effects When a quantity of masonry wants to be  picked out of the fabric of any Constitution in order to have the place supplied with better materials a batter∣ing ram is rather too potent an instrument to be used to effect the removal it will shake the edifice and may reduce it to a heap of formless ruin The old materials must be removed with care and the parts left unsupport∣ed must be carefully propped until the vacancy be filled up  THE Members of the Commons who sat at Oxford and who voted under compulsion at Westminster may be looked upon when contradistinguished to the remainder as one party in sentiment and as forming an undoubted majority of the original Assembly Hence even if every one of them had voted freely in the places where they sat and upon the same question that majority had lost the possibility of expressing a legal will But the Legi∣slative Assembly in France in the last period of its exis∣tence had been by their own fanaticism and the crimes it gave birth to forced to work in chains to demolish that edifice that glory of philosophy that pride of en∣lightened Europe the first Constitution  THE ruin brought upon Britain by the Leaders of these Associations paying no regard to their limits was almost extreme The observations on the hazards this country has run from Offensive Associations in other instances have in this Tract always been followed by an inquiry whe∣ther there was anything in the manners and character of the people previous to those several calamities which had a more alarming appearance of danger than can be ob∣served at present and I shall close this Section with an inquiry whether before the Civil Wars from the cir∣cumstances  of the times and the moral character of the people any more threatening appearances might have been discerned of a Revolution destroying the Consti∣tution and terminating almost in the despotism of Anar∣chy than have been of late years and are at present plainly seen among us  IN both periods we see Revolutions destructive to the Constitution attempted under the pretence of a reform the necessity of which exists not in one case and had ceased in the other by exciting fanaticism religious or political We have seen either species separately capa∣ble of producing the same effects upon the populace that is to bring all their ferocious passions into action consequently if they be stimulated by a mixture of both as was the case in the last Century it cannot produce a greater effect than either of them simply as for instance political fanaticism as each separately will occupy the active powers of the whole mind and both together can do no more  To consider next the real or supposed grievances of the two periodsSuch grievances must be either violations of right or privations of gratification by State charges or mixed By the Agitators of the last Century it was im∣pressed on the minds of the populace that many of their legal rights were violated and as it always happens in such times they equally believed what was truly and what was falsely alledged on this subject Stronger representa∣tions are now made and a more extensive circulation given them The great majority of the populace are taught that they are defrauded not only of many of their legal rights  as subjects but of a great mass of their natural rights as men and they give the same implicit belief to their de∣magogues now as their ancestors did in the last Century and the great amount of the taxes at present is as favour∣able a subject for inflammatory declamation as the ille∣gality of their imposition was then  LET us now enter into a comparison of the qualifica∣tions of the Agitators of the two periods for their re∣spective tasks The operations of those of the last age resembled the attacks of an undisciplined multitude com∣paratively without order or concert Their mode of ac∣tion is now reduced into a science and they are can∣toned over the whole country the chiefs of a hostile State within a State formed into the exactest discipline under an active Directory which knows how to distri∣bute its force and apply its operations to every point of attack and defence where they shall become necessary They are an army actuated by a single will and a single intelligence which has discovered a new and profound system of tactics  HAVING thus balanced their abilities for action we may pass to the review of the materials one of these Catilinarian bands of conspirators had and the other has now to act upon It will be said that  men have at this day before them the dreadful example of the infringement of the engagements of limitation by which the Parliament of Charles bound themselves and the people  But to this it will be replied that there never was a time in which the crime that followed them had so many and such determined advocates at least in the lower classes of the demagogues nor in which  they were heard by the multitude with such partial atten∣tion Nor though we call this an enlightened age are men enlightened by simply exchanging one set of prin∣ciples for another the mind is not enlightened with respect to any object which it formerly considered ex∣clusively in one point of view if it now comes to survey it exclusively in a second  BUT let it be admitted that the populace may possess a more exercised keenness of mind on political points now than in the middle of the last Century unless it can be shown that their morals are not worse that they are not more addicted to rapine that they have not less reve∣rence for laws as such or if the contrary of all this ap∣pears a melancholy truth with what advantage can an increase of such knowledge be pleaded when the ques∣tion is Can we put more faith in articles contained in their Covenants or Associations at this juncture than were due to the stipulations of their ancestorswhich repeated experiments proved to be intitled to none It is an acknowledged fact with respect to every individual that if as his reason grows more acute his principles grow worse his fidelity will not be improved his cha∣racter will even become more dangerous and that in a degree determined by the sum of those two changes and the same must be true of a multitude composed of such individuals  IF some increase of their knowledge be to be admitted the degeneracy of the morals of the populace is capable of fuller proof Will any one contend that the annual number of convictions of criminals does not increase  with much greater celerity than our population Are not criminal connections of the sexes the source of mi∣sery and profligacy more frequent among the lower or∣ders  This point is capable of being decided with precision from Parish Registers which give the proportion of illegitimate births to the whole number In a R  gister lately inspected on the subject of population this proportion was sound increasing with some equa∣lity throughout the whole of the present Century divided into con∣venient equal periods and that in the first period of a certain number of births ten were illegi  mate and in the last of the same number there were such birth or they were mereased in the proportion of sixteen to unity Before this examination it would not have been judged that the result of it instituted in the adjacent parishes or in the san  part or the kingdom would have  a  alarming appearance  But this question may be rested on the autho∣rity of Mr Hume certainly not a writer who had taken up the idea of a progressive degeneracy of the morals of mankind as the generations succeed each other and who was thence induced by his system to make a fine declama∣tion on the purity of a former age The account he has given us of the national character of the English at the commencement of that sanguinary period the Civil Wars may be esteemed a faithful portrait of what his extensive researches showed them to have been aid it demon∣strates that both the National Protestation and the Na∣tional Covenant which supplanted it were in that age experiments greatly safer than a General Association of the People now is  Never says that Writer was there a people less corrupted by vice and more actuated by principle than the English during that period never were there individuals who possessed more capa∣city more courage more public spirit more disinte∣rested  zeal  Hume v p He there adds  The infusion of one ingredient in too large proportion had corrupted all these noble principles and converted them into the most virulent poison  This may be understood by some to mean Puritanical fanaticism but I think erroneously as it has been shown on his own autho∣rity that the majority of the nation were not Puritans The pas∣sage seems to suggest nothing more or less than a principle of Mr Hume's heterodoxy in natural religion that there was too great a quantity of religious zeal then in the national character But I believe there was nothing of the gloom of superstition which clouded over the manners of the great majority of the nation or the Established Church at that time    Can this be said or is this believed of the character of the mass of the people at this day Are all these qualities admitted in all the leading Members of Opposition  SECTION VIII CONCLUSION FURTHER REMARKS ON MR FOX'S ASSOCIATION  THE first part of this Tract begins with a comparison of the nature of the Associations of and the Gene∣ral Association of the People under Mr Fox There remained many particular observations to make on the latter but the principles on which I intended to found some of them are such as will be received with greater authority when demonstrated by induction from History than if they had been simply proved by abstract reason∣ing  A further use also appeared to me to arise from this way of managing the subject it has enabled me to point out the similarity of the spirit of all commotions excited by Offensive Associations against an existing Government not despotic and more particularly of those where a Sec∣tion of the Associators originally sets out with democratic principles or takes them up in the course of their pro∣gress In this manner of treating the remainder of the subject there will he some recapitulations but they will be given with as much brevity as it will permit  THE Associations of may be compared to a cluster of about two thousand Republics independent or at most slightly connected by the laxest principle of fede∣ralism their object was Defensive From the history of such Associations in this country it appears that they alone have been useful in the support of the constitution of Government  It is admitted that the Constitution has been gradually ame∣liorated bits it may be made a question upon this admission how these ameliorations have been obtained The course has generally been that Kings at different times have granted beneficial laws and franchises to the people sometimes spontaneously as that great founder of the English Jurisprudence Edward the First sometimes to attach the people to their titles when doubtfulthus Henry the First granted a Charter rather more full than Magna Charta and the origin of it and at other times by a tacit or more express con∣tract for a large supply as the Petition of Rights The enjoyment of these franchises in act and effect has been at different times secured by Defensive Associations It is the felicity of this king∣dom that they were so obtained but it is not meant at a proof that all other modes of obtaining them are criminal    THE Association of Mr Fox is in its object l Offensive and it has been seen that all such of which a survey has been taken above have been attended with very fatal consequences and if the plan of this can be carried into execution completely or nearly so it will become a ma∣chine capable of destroying any Government the general body of the people being invited to become par∣ties thereto and generally so becoming its force will be effectively the greatest possible to this it adds the strongest degree of union while it has a Directory at its head the Whig Club which is to be regarded as under the con∣duct of an effective Dictator  A Declaration of the motives of the Club in recom∣mending this Association was read by Mr Mackintosh and unanimously approved of  Introduction p The emi∣nence of Mr M among our Political Writers impresses me strongly with the belief that he was the Author of the Declaration which he read his public act however proves it could contain nothing re∣pugnant to his avowed political principles As I have not his book I shall transcribe some part of what Dr Parr has said of his wri∣tings  In Mackintosh I see the sternness of a Republican with∣out his acrimony  but this may probably describe only the cha∣racter of his sentiments on abuses of power The Doctor pronoun∣ces an "unqualified negative" on his opinion that  the existence of ranks is repugnant to the social union  from this we know what he must think of an Hereditary Senate or House of Lords in a State And in the conclusion of his critique on his work Dr Parr lays down a further capital point of difference between himself and Mr M in these words  I prefer two independent Houses for legislative deliberation to one and that in a King with the substance of the executive power will be found a better guar∣dian of the public weal than in the mockery of a pageant King with little more than the shadow  These extract will not be supposed to be an inimical account of Mr Mackintosh's Principles of Government as Dr Parr in a note applies to him what Cicero said of HortensiusQuinti Hortensii admodum adolescentis inge∣nium ut Phidiae signum simul adspectum et probatum est    Now let it be supposed that a man of great ambition yet that ambition purified from all meanness whole plain manners are consummately attaching yet manly as if his object were power over all men collectively not in∣dividually and possessing an eloquence masculine pure and commanding is set at the head of such an omni∣potent Association admit him also to be a man of dex∣trous and profound ability fertile in expedients rapid in the execution of his plans and that the citadel of Government in his native country has a considerable strength for resistance but is by no means an impregna∣ble fortress generally surrendering but by capitulation after a longer or a shorter siege and that in the chec∣quered fortunes of his political life he has twice made his way into it by something like a  coup de main  and that he has been said the last time to have begun to strengthen this fortress as soon as he was possessed of it with additional works constructed on a new system of fortification so far improved as to bid defiance to any regular mode of attack yet discoveredin dange∣rous times if such a man misallied himself he must be highly dangerous  THE qualities by which he has attained power have been indicated and mixing in his councils when in place somewhat too much of the qualities by which he obtained it let him be supposed each time suddenly to have fallen and now well past the meridian of life▪ but again entertaining some fair hopes by the aid of the band of friends whom he saw about him eminent in ability and with high national respect attached to their names at last to obtain what had been the object of the labours of his youth and of his manhood to the verge of age  to see this removed out of his reach by any common means by the secession of the great body of his party with every name of higher ornament to it at their head from the danger they ultimately discern in the course he has been of late years pursuing as having been unduly qualified to the nature of a mixed Government we might well dread from the pall experience of his poli∣tical enterprize that if he openly put himself at the head of such an Association as I have been describing thereby pointing out his despair of success by every other resource that he might not be unwilling to re∣acquire possession of his object by uncommon means  AND if at such a time there exist a Republican Fac∣tion in the State or a Party that should contend for a mixed Government with a pageant of a King and a single Elective Chamber which infallibly terminating in the former is for the present to be regarded as the same thing  The stability of such a system compared with that of the Eng∣lish Constitution has been very well illustrated by that of is  a two footed stool  and a "tripod" Sec Dr W Thomson in Dr Parr's Sequel c p  and the most eminent man as to ability ranging under either of those two titles of the same thing having brought forward a Declaration of the motives to entering into such a political compact which motives must be consistent with the principles he has publicly maintained if the effective Head of the Directory with the whole body should unanimously approve of that Declaration the only visible end of his conduct can be to invite such Party or Parties to a close junction with him by thus holding out to them an idea not obscurely conveyed of a certain degree of concurrence with them  in their systems and the apprehension of it to the sup∣porters of the present form of Government Must not this man by this junction flinging himself at a greater distance from his former supporters seem openly to re∣nounce all ideas of reunion with them the only regu∣lar means left to him to obtain that preeminence which he cannot be imagined ever to have intermitted his pur∣suit of And must he not appear at the head of such an Association dangerous in the extreme  I NOW take leave of this hypothetical personage and come to a real one But I must here premise an abridged account of the original plan and object of the Jacobin Club from Dr Moore as it will be expedient to enter into a comparison between these and a principle laid down in the House of Commons in  IN a small number of Deputies sent from Brittany to the States General of France associated under the name of the Committee of that province Being afterwards joined by some other members of that Assembly and per∣sons attached to liberty they assumed new titles copying the style of some English Societies taking first the name of The Revolution Club and ultimately that of Friends of the Constitution From the place of their assembling they received from the Public the name of JACOBINS under which they have since become so fatally distin∣guished In this Society at first there were many persons celebrated for their talents and character Clubs of the same nature were multiplied over all France who regularly cor∣responded with them and who finding a central body ready formed through which they might transmit their opinions and wishes to the National Assembly they ap∣pointed  them their agents for this purpose and as the Club had at the beginning assumed the functions of the Delegates of those in whose behalf they held themselves forth as acting they were by other Provincial Clubs ac∣knowledged in that capacity and the irregularity of the assumption was thus to appearance done away It is to be observed that when this system was completely organized and their extraconstitutional functions thus confirmed the Club differed from the Meeting of the Delegates of the County Associations who sat in Lon∣don in in one circumstance only The objects the latter were to treat on were specified consequently their delegation would have terminated when these ends were obtained those of the former were unlimited the continuance of their functions not being dependent on their obtaining any specific object or objects  "THE avowed business of the Society" of Jacobins  was to deliberate and debate on subjects of Govern∣ment and watch over the general interests of Liber∣ty  Moores Journ v I p    Now in a Government where everything de∣pends in effect on the decisions of the Representative this amounts to  watching over its conduct  without limitation of time  It is evident such a superintendence wherever established must grow up into substantial cont  oul on Government in general the same power must produce the some effects in every country even at least a Perpetual Assembly of Delegates would have destroyed the Constitution by constituting an effective Fourth Estate of Par∣liament  and to no more and if the object of the  Delegates in had been so extensive in that meeting England would have exhibited the first example of a Jaco∣bin Society  BUT it is to the full extent of that object that the principle goes which is laid down in the following ex∣tract of a speech attributed to Mr Fox It is to be found in the History of our Parliamentary Transactions printed in The New Annual Register in the wri∣ter of which appears strongly attached to his interests  By what law or what act that Statesman is made to say was it declared to be unconstitutional for the people of this country to appoint Delegates to reside in the metropolis and  to watch the conduct of their Represen∣tatives  British and Foreign Hist p    Such interrogations carry the full force of affirmations  IF those who gave to the original Breton Committee its last Constitution whereby it was transformed into a Jacobin Club did not look for its avowed principle in the doctrine here laid down yet if they had they must have found it In defining the functions of that Club the Legislators who gave to it its most finished code have almost copied the expressions here attributed to Mr Fox for if there be any difference between  watching over the general interests of liberty  and  watching over the conduct of our Representatives  as the latter in∣cludes their whole conduct in all its branches it seems the more comprehensive if we do not take the words  preceding the first citation as formerly quoted in aid thereof and it would be very difficult to show the fatal Institution of the Jacobins not to have been derived from the principle laid down in this History  IF the above declaration ascribed to Mr Fox contain his real present sentiments and we combine this with his putting himself at the head of an Association of the Re∣publicans real and virtual the qualities of which will be neither mitigated or modified by some misguided men of better principles and little foresight joining in it it is a step big with danger to the existing Constitution  BUT I have done with the subject in this point of view and make no doubt that there are many even among his old opponents who regret that he did not join the illus∣trious body of his late political friends in their secession from the remnant which continues to call itself The Whig Club who think there is a part remaining for him to act at least equal in dignity and splendor to any that he has yet acted in whose wishes continue to be that forgetting some of those extremes of opinion which made "him push his better Angel from his side" he would in part follow those seceders they would rejoice to see him without that appearance of intire transition which sometimes rightly sometimes wrongly has de∣stroyed the reputation of great rulers of Parties for a time avowedly unconnected and alone a Party by him∣self assuming that function within which can belong to no exclusive and organised body of men without the  walls of the House  to watch over the conduct of our Representatives  LET us now examine the mode by which the object of this Association is to be obtained thereby  the sub∣scribers pledge themselves only to prosecute a sole ob∣ject by every legal and peaceable means  This implies the absence of all force apparent or latent in the prose∣cution of it  AND suppose on this occasion the authors of this plan to be able to carry it into effect or procure a Ge∣neral Association of the People is not the union of the People irresistible As such Will it excite no appre∣hension in the Legislature The terror of an irresistible petitioner is not among the means to obtain a repeal of a law which are to be called peaceable It is not the Legislation of the land but the law of the stronger the  jus fortioris  which decides in effect upon the merits of such a petition But it is only what takes place by the will of the Legislature acting in total freedom which is either legally or peaceably obtained The act of appeal to the  jus fortioris  formally made or sufficiently indi∣cated by preparation though denied in words sets aside the Law and Legislation of the Land and what is ob∣tained thereby never can be according to that legal for the Law sanctions nothing while it is in a state of non∣existence  WE know that a Society has the right of selfpreserva∣tion as well as an individual and that there are cases of extreme necessity when the action of the whole peo∣ple  may be called forth But it is to be observed that it never can be brought forward peaceably it must operate by force or by terror such a measure is in effect resist∣ance at least it even amounts to compulsion whether avowed as such or not which is something more  I TAKE it for granted the necessity must be as great and as obvious when the whole People are to he united against the three constituent parts of the Legislature as when that union is directed only against one against an act or acts of the King Lords and Commons as against an act or acts of the King alone The circumstan∣ces under which the latter measure is constitutional have been laid down by Sir Joseph Jekyl  the very standard of Whig principles of his age  and on the occasion when they were to be defined with the utmost accuracy in order that the maxims on which the great preservers of the Constitution in acted should be left upon record to all posterity This he did at the Trial of Dr Sacheverel when speaking in the name of the Managers for the Commons he defines two great conditions under which resistance to the Crown becomes justifiable These shall be compared with the present casest  We have insisted that in no case can resistance be lawful  Lawful  i e in soro conscientiae  recognize the right of resistance in express terms as the Managers for the Commons strongly asserted Indeed that a case should be established by Law in which Law is to have no force is a contra∣diction in terms  but in case of extreme necessity and where the Constitu∣tion cannot otherwise be preserved  d  And such necessty ought to be plain and obvious to the sense and  judgement of the whole Nation  and this every good subject who knows the history of the times believes with him to have been "the case at the Revolution" The act of the whole Legislature ought not to be opposed by the union of the whole People upon slighter grounds I would therefore ask the promoters of this Association How they can prove the extreme necessity that men should continue liable to be tried and condemned for trea∣son on proceedings analogous to the principles  of an  ex post facto  law  Hume v p note and Appendix No I    that the beacons which now more plainly point out legal danger to the factious should be removed and they should be left at their own extreme hazard and with some danger to the Public to the chance of running upon a rock not less fatal for being sunk almost out of sight For the object of the Associa∣tion is to restore them to this situation out of which the two Bills have taken them  BUT let it be granted that the proof of the extreme necessity of this restoration is by them made out in full form still that necessity wants the second essential pro∣perty for them to be intitled to act upon it it is not as it  ought to be plain and obvious to the sense and judgement of the whole Nation  It is certain that the great majority of that class who by their situation are able to acquire and who actually do possess by far the greater portion of political and constitutional science the greater weight of the whole mass of the political knowledge of the State deny the existence of the neces∣sity they even affirm the necessity of the existence of the Acts thus opposed as appears by their Addresses  to the Throne and their Petitions to the late Parlia∣ment  IN this relative unanimity of the whole Legislature in support of the two Acts supported itself by almost the  bo∣norum omnium consensus  the consent of all good Englishmen notwithstanding all the professions that can be made of using none but legal and peaceable means to obtain the repeal of them what confidence can the Associations en∣tertain of success except from power or the apprehen∣sion of power The very act of association adds no argument to the repeal and I am certain the names of the Club which brought it forward in its present state does not add to that authority The measure is a tacit menace to the Legislature by no means a peaceable mode to carry through a petition and if not contrary to the letter of the Laws of England contrary to the univer∣sal spirit of Law Bacon in his Historical Discourses says that  when the written law maketh it treason to compass the destruction of the King's person it leav∣eth it obvious to common sense that it is a higher de∣gree of treason to compass the destruction of the Re∣presentative  Continuation p  And by the same mode of argument it may be shown that the coercion of the King by effect∣ive menace in the exercise of his Royal functions being a high crime and misdemeanor the coercion of the Legi∣slature by similar means is of the same criminality and surely such a coercion of the Commons according to the principles of these men is a wound of the majesty of the People which resides in them and  all men do  agree says Bacon that treason is a wound of ma∣jesty  Continuation p    THE Heads of such an Association would not commit themselves in such a measure without strong hopes of success against the almost unanimous opposition of the informed classes of Society at large and the union of all the constituent parts of the Legislature On what can they found that hope They must expect aid from some other quarter external aid but which they can cause to operate in the very walls of both Houses to awe them and the supporters of the Bills into submission The horizon at least must be involved in darkness the sullen sound of distant thunders must be heard from many quarters it the spirit that raised the storm do not roll its strength over their heads and let all its rage descend upon them If these leaders of the people do not em∣ploy actual tumults and commotions to force a reluctant Parliament into their measures they must suffer them to be inforced by the fear of their near approach or they are embarked in the most ridiculous of all undertakings as it must he the most fatal to every future rational view of coming  nto power which they may be supposed to entertain  LET us grant now that the Heads of the Association are most strictly determined to confine themselves to the respectful conduct of real petitioners that they will submit to repulse after repulse without exceeding its bounds the certain fate of their application to Parliament  without the apprehension of latent or appare  force I say their best intentions realised in irreproach∣able conduct will probably add very little to the pro∣tection of the State from the extreme of danger hang∣ing over it from this Association if the project take place  FOR their repeated efforts alone will generate a ferment in the minds of the populace and can they answer that the lower classes of the associators will not take up ei∣ther  their  object or  some other  reinvolve the metropolis in the disorders of and expose the whole kingdom to them In that year when the multitude had seen the counties holding meetings to censure the internal ad∣ministration of the kingdom forming Committees of Correspondence sending Delegates to sit in Congress or Convention in the metropolis at that period as it had been said above an individual of a doubtful description between an enthusiast and a madman availed himself of the agitated state of their minds to direct them to an end with a new name and they mixing ferocity and the de∣sire of plunder with certainly a very weak degree of re∣ligious fanaticism had nearly effected the ruin of the capital Yet at this instant there is a greater real fer∣ment in the minds of the lower classes than Lord George Gordon was able to excite nor if the Chiefs of the Asso∣ciation be now as averse to lead then into similar excesses as it is here supposed will they want many really for∣midable enthusiastic leaders to hurry them forward  NOR can the seat of Government at this juncture nor the kingdom in general expect less misery from such a  commotion if not instantly suppressed than the afflicted territory of France has recently suffered In an insur∣rection of the English populace political fanaticism and the eagerness of plunder will jointly stimulate them even at first but the devastations of France for a long time were caused by that fanaticism alone the spirit of plun∣der was not mixed with it Even so late as the time when he palace of the  uilleries was stormed the very assa  sins killed on the spot several men  who on that day at∣tempted to steal the plate  It must appear says Dr Moore in a peculiar manner strange to persons ac∣customed to live in a country where there are fre∣quent robberies and burglaries in spite of the Govern∣ment being undisturbed and the Laws in full force  to find none  where all the hinges and supports of Law and Government are loose and shaking from a recent convulsion  Journ v p See also p    And great as the sufferings of that kingdom are and have been if a similar insurrection were to take place here the disposition of the populace to robbery and plunder being added to the fanaticism of liberty already highly excited in them greater would our calamities he This conclusion is fully confirmed by an authority which will be very unexpected to many that of Mr Barlow in his Advice to the Privileged Orders who informs us that  the Mobs in France were by no means to be compared with English Mobs in point of indiscriminate ferocity and private plunder  Page    UNITE the populace by an Association exhibit to them an object to acquire and if there be the least delay  in its acquisition they will rush forward upon the scene of action Little is the distance with them between the point of time when they shall be thus combined and sti∣mulated and when they break forth in outrage for sooner than stand still they will make rapid vibrations in the most contrary directions moving with impetuosity to∣ward one point and returning with the same impetuosity to that from which they sat out In the shortest space of time before James fled to Feversham the sovereign po∣pulace of London had without doubt pronounced his  decheance  but although by that flight he had attempted to annihilate civil government in this country upon his return he was received by them with every mark of the most zealous affection  This great turn in the minds of the city  Burnet's Occasional Sermons preface p  continued during his residence at Ro∣chester or until the d of December Having proceeded to the extreme in that direction of movement and un∣able to continue stationary we have seen that so early as the th of the month of February they announced a se∣cond change of their will by an insurrection to compel the Convention to declare his throne vacant  HENCE it may be reasonably predicted that if the pro∣jectors of this Association be able to embody the popu∣lace nominally under them the latter will not wait for orders to come into action The desire to copy the ex∣ample of the populace of France prevails among many and by their being drawn more together by this dangerous measure it will be more generally diffused And History informs us that the spirit of insurrection has mostly mi∣grated from France to England The religious Associa∣tion or League under the Guises was the precedent of  the Presbyterian Solemn League and Covenant and the Association of the Jacquerie on the principle of the equal Rights of Men was copied in England by Wat Tyler and his associates The eruption of both these evils was kept back here for a considerable period and if either of these events excited any alarm in England when they first took place the passing of five or six or even ten or twelve years without their producing any effect was no proof that such alarm was not founded on real danger and it will be happy for this country this generation and posterity if the system of the Jacobins the way of which seems now preparing by Associations tendered to the populace be kept permanently at a distance from us  BUT let us pass from this investigation of the probabi∣lity of the peaceable legality of the  intended  good conduct of this Association which if it be not meant to over∣awe Parliament is a great movement without a motive and a prodigal waste of the last chance of the man who guides it of standing again at the head of a great and regular Party let us pass from this to the declaration of the limitation of its object and consider the security arising from the engagement that the Association will confine its operations to the single object announced This security must be determined from the description of the parties to the contract and the matter thereof con∣jointly  THE whole Party of the avowed Republicans will be included among the subscribers all of them the defen∣ders and almost all of them the admirers of the viola∣tors and violation of the solemn engagement to the sup∣port of Monarchy taken by the French Assembly in July  and broken the th of the following August What they defend and what they admire they will not be very backward in copying Together with these the party will consist of men of some other descriptions of those nominally professing to wish for a King and a single Assembly of Representatives in order to introduce a Republic by stealth and those who wish for such a system in reality the latter of which coming to act in a closer union with the two former sections of the As∣sociation will be easily won over to their party for the most decided opinions have always the loudest advocates and indeed we can hardly discover on what ground they can hold out against the arguments with which these allies of theirs will be able to assail them on the folly of a system whose only consequence must apparently be to prolong during a sad and bloody interval the last con∣vulsions and dying struggle of Monarchy The remain∣der of the Association will be composed of those who wish for what they call a Reform of the Commons or some other Reform and at every hazard of the State for the more temperate advocates of these measures will not join the Association Those who were content with our system of laws before the passing of the two Acts who will join in this compact will be very few indeed al∣most the whole of them having concurred in declar∣ing their opinion that the temporary regulations in∣troduced by these laws is at this time necessary for the preservation of the Constitution of Government Hence it follows that the obtaining the repeal of them will satisfy the wishes of this last division of the Asso∣ciators only a very small minority of the whole body and every one must concur in admitting that the proba∣bility that they will stop when they have obtained those  points which they have fixed as the limits of their claim is much diminished as the wishes of the great majority and their principles extend indefinitely further  I COME now to speak of the matter or nature of this engagement and shall show it in one case to be to∣tally useless and in all others totally nugatory as imposing no obligation on the greater part of the sub∣scribers according to their political principles  FOR in the first place if the Association do not be∣come general or at least obtain strength enough to over∣awe Parliament the promise will be useless the security of the State from all the effects of their proceeding be∣yond their assigned limits being as firm in their simple want of power as in their want of power and their respective obligation the promise not to make the at∣tempt conjointly  FURTHER if it do not become useless as above it will then be nugatory for the sovereign power as the sup∣porters of this Association hold resides in the people whenever they chuse to act and consequently the legi∣slative power which is a branch thereof The people may if they please make and consequently repeal laws may they not therefore when associated repeal that clause of the compact limiting to one object the exertion of their universal and illimitable sovereignty for if they can repeal a law made to bind themselves they can annul an article of any obligation if not founded in moral right  AND to whom do the subscribers give this obligation To the people and the party to whom it is given is in full power to remit it When therefore the subscription becomes general the subscribers will be the people and it will be an obligation entered into by the people individually to the people collectively a compact entered into by them∣selves to themselves which is absolutely nugatory  AND if any collection of persons signing such en∣gagement shall call themselves the People although their numbers be not such as to entitle them to assume that name by their assumption they claim as their own right all the rights of the people in which is included ac∣cording to their principles the right of declaring the li∣mitation of action to which they have or shall pledge themselves to be void  THERE are other grounds to show that such a pro∣mise can be of no validity or not be the foundation of any obligation on the givers of it When two parties exist in a State the validity of their promises stands much upon the same ground as those given by independent na∣tions to each other The authors who have treated on the reciprocal rights of nations have described those pro∣mises from which no obligation arises and in defining them I follow Grotius  To give validity to a pro∣mise the subjectmatter must be such that the per∣son giving it has a full right to perform it wherefore the promise to do an illicit act is not valid because no one has or can acquire a right to perform it  De Jure Bel Pac l c s    And by parity of reason a promise to omit an act of moral  obligation so given is void and null in itself Now I say to remove any great grievance under which we strongly believe our country to suffer when it is in our power is an act of moral obligation The parties to the Asso∣ciation are known to declare that this country labours under many removeable grievances beside the two Acts for the repeal of which they combine hence their pro∣mise to stop at that repeal if it be in their power to pro∣ceed any farther is an engagement  not to perform  an act of moral obligation and therefore null and void  BUT let it now be admitted for a moment that in their specification of limits beyond which they would not go they have contracted an obligation to their op∣ponents or to the State The melancholy experience of our Civil Wars in the last age points out to us what lit∣tle reliance can be placed on all such assurances From the manners of the nation in that period it has been shewn that the utmost fidelity might have been expected in the performance of all their engagements from its prevalent and general character of piety men might with confidence have believed that the national Protestation consecrated as it were by one of the most solemn forms of religion would be sacredly and inviolably adhered to Religion was considered by them as a more immutable thing than a form of government is by us There was no visible party among them who conceived that its obligation was founded on the assent of the nation that it might be believed experimentally for a month or a quarter or a year and then be abolished by ordinance of the two Houses and another enacted in its stead by their own authority or on the requisition of the sovereign people They held when  they took the Protestation that no power could absolve them from it except that in whose presence they profes∣sed to have made it And when we see by the event that even in such times no effectual confidence could be placed in that solemn declaration what reliance can we afford to the promises contained in the instrument now brought forward especially if we take into the account that if it be generally signed the parties thereto will according to their own ideas be of right able to absolve themselves from the obligation thereof I do not tax the body of the promoters of this Association with intending to im∣pose upon their countrymen with false coin but when they shall ultimately come to discover that according to their principles they have obliged themselves to nothing in the limits they have laid down I shall not sanguine∣ly expect that their performances will extend a whit be∣yond their obligation Those of our ancestors in more moral times and on a similar occasion fell far short of theirs  A FEW remarks must be added on the conduct of the populace when excited into action and its consequences When embodied they are always found to be actuated by the most extravagant opinions afloat those which most flatter their deceitful hopes their envy of their su∣periors and their ferocity and spirit of depredation and that day when the populace calling itself the People shall carry its first great point against a reluctant majo∣rity influenced by the apprehension of tumults out of doors will be effectively the last day of the power of the three constituent parts of Parliament for they are brought forward by expectations diffused generally among them of a change of their situation in life for the bet∣ter  of a multiplication of the objects of common use and enjoyment and a diminution of the number of the privations their state condemns them to their first vic∣tory will make no difference in their situation disap∣pointment will inflame them more and they will be caught to form new expectations from the effect of going further and thus they will be rendered eager for a se∣cond interposition of their strength which will be dou∣bled by an appearance of success although it has been to them fruitless But their Leaders in this country it will be said will have a limited object in view▪ and will know how to stop them The fallacy of relying upon this which is matter of universal experience has been recently confirmed In France there were some great and wellmeaning men among those who put the whole body of the people into motion When they thought they had gone far enough they chose to stop A set of subaltern Leaders at that juncture urged the populace on further whose irresistible weight and impulse bore them down and they were trampled to death under their feet Their new conductors when they had carried them the lengths they desired that is when they thought themselves se∣curely placed at their head wished likewise in their turn that they should come to a halt They tried to effect it and shared the same fate as their predecessors The mul∣titude were still excited to continue their march by Leaders of a viler class The place they were gotten to it was truly argued was little better than a rocky or sandy des  rt and they were assured that a single day's journey more would lead them to the promised land of per∣fect freedom and abundance where their whole future lives would be spent in feasting and revelry Their migration  under these last Leaders brought them into the land of famine and bloody ferocious anarchy  IT will become at this time the original institutors of all such Associations as have no remote tendency to promote popular insurrections to reflect that when the lower class of people begin to act in matters of Govern∣ment there is no ability no vigour which can restrain them within the limits of their original plan To carry some points Cromwell brought the Levelling Agitators into action when they had served his purpose he wanted to reduce them into their former inefficiency They re∣sisted by one of the greatest exertions of personal and political courage of which History furnishes an example he obtained the delusive appearance of a triumph over them but the realities of the victory all remained to the spirit of agitating Even Cromwell himself gave way he was compelled to relinquish his former plans of per∣sonal greatness and seek for new ones in the act of yielding to that impulse he could not resist  Appendix No V  There may be men in this Association whose political dexterity and vigour deserve to be thought highly of but I do not think that man lives whose arm is so well sinewed that he can shape his way against a torrent which Cromwell could only breast for a short time and then was hurried away by its rapidity For to me in this part of his life he seems like one of the mightiest of men struggling for a few minutes against the stream in some branch of the In∣dus when the periodical rains have augmented its force to the utmost and then compelled almost to resign him∣self entirely to it and to make his way obliquely with incredible effort to an island of jungle in the middle of  the channel the thickets of which are filled with tigers and serpents its only inhabitants where he is inclosed from all escape to the safe shore he has left which lies in full prospect before him while deaths without resistance the most terrible to nature and which alone could be the object of terror to him press on him or watch in am∣bush around him on every other side  AS accurately as the object of the Association is in words limited if we suppose a majority of the Leaders of name faithfully to intend to disembody it as soon as its sole avowed end is obtained shall we believe the same of all of them For it has been shewn upon the prin∣ciples some receive as the foundation of Civil Govern∣ment that the promise this instrument holds out is a nullity but if it were otherwise and were that engagement in its nature binding and all the ostensible Heads of the Association should be determinately faithful to it they are not the men who are the direct and proximate Lea∣ders of the populace it is a certain set of intermediate agents who act in that capacity who directly hold this terrible power in their hands and the greater Leaders must like Cromwell give way to their intermediate in∣struments to those who can inflame the Multitude into madness They must become the instruments of their instruments in new crimes they may detest or fall the second set of victims to irresistible ignorance inflamed into immitigable ferocity  I SHALL add here a little and but at little on the mode of reasoning generally pursued in this Tract There are men who object to a constant reference to the tragedies  now acting and acted in France during the last seven years of which some direct mention and to which more allusion has been made in the preceding Tract  We are not  they tell us  to point out the pretences and means by which that and by parity of reason any other nation has been ensnared into all the miseries of Anar∣chy in order to keep alive a jealous circumspection with respect to every measure which may introduce it into this kingdom  Hence the argument from historical in∣duction chiefly used here which impresses the principles of experience and those only upon the mind with the very decision and warmth of feeling with which Nature meant them to be embraced is proscribed by those who lean to the doctrines of the Republican School They will have men addressed as beings formed of pure and im∣passive intellect only or if they graciously permit us to continue to see they prohibit to us the exercise of the faculty of feeling  YET they might as well bid us blot out from the re∣cords of universal history the errors or crimes which have led so many and great nations into ruin say that it is useless to make any observations on the causes which brought it on or the miseries by which it was followed Must we extract no useful lessons for our own nation from the great register of the experience of all ages It is not in nature and therefore I am sure it is not in wisdom to turn away our eyes from the series of French revolutions so re∣cent and almost unprecedented in the sum of their calamities while we are in the very neighbourhood of the contagion when such multitudes are desirous of introducing it among us Who that had just seen a noble vessel striking upon  a sand bank near our very coast which had not been be∣fore discovered and totally wrecked would say that a buoy or a floating light should not if possible be im∣mediately moored upon it and if the position of the whole of the sand were not accurately known that we ought not to keep the sounding line in our hand when we have the least suspicion that our vessel may be getting upon it  WHEN Mr Burke foresaw so many of its ensuing ca∣lamities in the first movements of the French Revolution his probable train of reason from cause to effect was de∣rided Dr Priestley fairly told him  he would not call in question his gift of prophecy his peculiar talent to see all events past present and to come in their most concealed causes  Experience has nevertheless proved the error of those who disbelieved and those who doubted these predictions however we might have been able with safety to ourselves to con∣tinue to doubt whose opinions were the best founded until the event shew it clearly Our existence as a na∣tion under an orderly government might not have been hazarded even by disbelief but that these evils were in reality then impending over France the followers of Dr Priestley now admit yet from the continuance of the same propensions they will dis∣pute the probability of the conclusions here drawn from historical induction that a General Association of the People is a measure threatening this kingdom with great danger I conclude with observing that this is a case in which we cannot with equal safety postpone coming to a decided opinion until a second and equal series of ca∣lamities to those we have been recently witnesses to shall convict them of a second error  APPENDIX  APPENDIX  No I STRICTURES ON THE STATUTE OF TREASON ENACTED IN THE TH OF EDW III  THE Law of Treason as it stands by Edw c has been by many considered as a masterpiece of jurispru∣dence to which nothing is left to be added by succeeding Legis∣lators without undermining the national liberties This opinion it now becomes of consequence to a very active party to defend with its utmost strength In the preceding pages that statute has been spoken of in terms very different of the reason of which some account certainly ought to be given Its defects shall therefore here be shewn which are such that in vices of its formation and matter it is absolutely an unique in our law books  IT recites seven cases or acts of treason three of which directly attack the King's person and dignity and when a culprit is indicted on any one of them the Judges are impowered to pro∣ceed to try him for that crime  THIS is abstracted from Blackstone who is not sparing in his panegyric upon this statute he says further  But the Act does not stop here but goes on  BECAUSE other like cases of treason may happen in time to come which cannot be thought of or declared at present it is accorded that if any other case supposed to be treason which is not above specified doth happen before any Judge the Judge shall tarry without going to judgment of the treason till the cause be shewed and declared before the King and his Parlia∣ment whether it ought to be judged treason or other felony  V c    Although the meaning of this clause or salvo † is obvious I shall premise the comment of Nathaniel Bacon upon it to the strictures I have to make thereon  Other treasons are left to the determination of the Parliament as occasion should offer itself whereof divers examples of a new stamp occurred  I find the clause to have been so denominated at the trial of Lord Strafford Bak Chron  within forty years next ensuing which were of a temporary regard and lived and died with the times  Bacon's Continuation of Discourses v p    Those cases  which occasion offers  must be so submitted after the act or occasion occurs This clause has been marked with great suspicion by a writer of much penetration Parliament had proceeded upon it in condemning Sir Thomas Talbot for treason for an attempt on the lives of the Dukes of Lancaster and Gloucester in the reign of Richard the Second He imagined  this most advantageous law for the subject that ever was enacted  to have been violated in this case as  it is not to be supposed that men were to be judged by a law  ex post facto  At least if such be the meaning of the clause it may be affirmed that men were at that time very ignorant of the first principles of law and justice  Hist v p note    That such is the meaning of the clause is evident on the mere reading that it is not a new sense of it is evident from Bacon's comment No legal authority stands higher with the party who attack the two late Acts  The following account of this salvo is extracted from Lane's plea for Lord Strafford before the House of Lords See Baker's Chronicle First As to the practice upon it  According to this reservative in the eighth year of Richard the Second one charged before the King's Bench was afterwards referred to the Parliament and there though the fact  was not  contained in the body of the statute yet because of the  proviso  before mentioned it was adjudged treason  In the eleventh year of the same king the Duke of Ireland and Nevil Archbishop of York were impeached of high treason by Gloucester Arundel and Warwick and  notwithstanding the statute  convicted thereof by the  salvo  but in his twentyfirst year the sentence was reversed and those three Noblemen themselves were adjudged traitors In the reign of his successor the repeal was repealed H and the sentence on the three latter Noblemen in its turn reversed  Such were the tossings to and fro of treason and all because of that uncertain proviso  All the confusion of the law of treason at this time appears to have arisen from its operation I discover no vestige at this time of any new treason having been declared nothing of the kind could be wanted for any purpose of oppression We come now to the sentiments of our ancestors thereon after they had for a certain period experienced its effect when put in force  In the Parliament of the first year of Henry the Fourth  a Petition was preferred by the Nobility to have treason limited within some statute because they knew not what to speak or what to do for sear thereof and  n cap an Act was made upon this Petition that the salvo should be holden repealed in all times to come    And it is said in the records that there was great joy at the making of this Act in that the drawn sword hanging over every man's head by this slender thread of a consequence or illation was removed by that Act  We shall see afterward contrary to what was then urged by Lane that this salvo was reenacted before the year    I PROCEED to shew first That the Act with this clause tacked to it violates several of the great fundamental principles  of Legislation and in the second place that without it even in the judgement of the authors of it it was inadequate to the pre∣vention of treason  FIRST It violates the great fundamental principles of Legis∣lation Titius has committed a crime the Act leaves it  to the determination of Parliament  whether that crime be treason or not the treasonable nature of the act of Titius was therefore indeterminate before it was committed it was not determined to be such by law before the "occasion offered itself" Now I say upon the conjoint authority of Blackstone and Montesquieu  that if the crime of high treason be indeterminate this alone is sufficient to make any Government degenerate into arbitrary power  Com v p et Sp L l c    THE decisions of the Legislature on the salvo in the case of Titius may be in two forms First That the act of Titius shall be judged treason in him and in all future cases and secondly that it shall be so judged but the judgment shall not be drawn into precedent In proceedings of parliament upon this Act we find examples of both the former is upon the principles of the Imperial rescripts and papal decretals the latter on that of the privilegia noticed in the times of the Roman Commonwealth  OF a decision of the first kind or a crime made treason by re∣script we have an instance in the case of one Rouse in  who had poisoned a great pot of porridge in the Bishop of Rochester's kitchen  Poisoning was then by a statute made treason and Rouse suffered upon it This Act says Burnet  was founded on the power reserved in the th of Edward the Third to Parliaments to declare  in time coming  what crimes were treason  Hist Res Abridgment p    We see this declaratory law operated retrospectively It is evident that this mode of proceeding is by a law made  de post facto  THIS mode of proceeding was in essence the same as the Imperial rescript and of the worst species A rescript Blackstone thus describes  When any doubt arose upon the construction of the Roman laws the usage was to state the case to the Emperor in writing and take his opinion upon itThe answers of the Emperor were called his rescripts  Com v p    Montes∣quieu whom Blackstone here copies adds that  the Papal decretals were properly speaking rescripts one sees that it is a bad sort of Legislation  The title of the chapter here quoted is "A bad Mode of giving Laws" and the rescript is the sole instance he produces Some of the better Sovereigns of the Empire thought this power too great to be exercised in a sim∣ple Monarchy Trajan often refused to issue rescripts and Macrinus had resolved to abolish the whole collection of them  E  p des L l c    And indeed this law is the only instance in which the Legisla∣ture has shewn any disposition to copy the Imperial or Papal tyranny  SECONDLY But in the year which being very near the time in which the great statute of treason was made we may ex∣pect to find in the proceedings on it a greater conformity to the meaning of the original Legislators we find it applied in a manner still more adverse to the nature of law The Lord Beauchamp of Holt Sir James Berners and John Salisbury were by virtue of the clause here censured tried and condemned for high treason and the Parliament concluded their process by a declaration that none of the articles decided on these trials to be treason should ever afterwards be drawn into precedent by the Judges  Hume v p  that is these acts were treason in the individuals but in no other persons There was nothing however in this proceeding which was contrary to the letter of the statute  THE limits an article of an Appendix impose upon me will not permit me to state an objection which might be with very little propriety urged here objections little in real weight may re∣quire long answers men to whom it may occur will see it is to be solved by the following principle There are two bad states into which a mixed and good Government may degenerate des∣potism and anarchy When circumstances give us the power of guarding against either and the  necessity  of using it be  extreme  we are to use it What is to be done on  such nevertobeexpected occasions  Walpole at the Trial of Sacheverel    is to be sought for only in that code of moral law which is written in the bosom of the upright friend of his country As they cannot be foreseen the laws of the land cannot provide against them they cannot ordain when their let∣ter may be disobeyed or when for the safety of the State measures must be taken against individuals in cases alike unforeseen and therefore alike unprovided for In each by an invincible necessity the necessity of its nature  law must be silent  This is simply a maxim of the great men who effected the Revolution with its converse added  EVERY statute which has been successively convenient for an Opposition to ground those arguments upon which they expect will operate with the most force on the populace has successively enjoyed for its term the honour of being called the Palladium of British Liberty and the pretensions of none were ever more strongly insisted upon than the statute under consideration at the present juncture But if we look at the conclusion of it we may pronounce him to be a very "feeble amateur" indeed and with no knowledge of the  costume  who pretends that this is rightly named the Palladium The insignia point out the error very clearly the sword she holds in her hand is the very sword of  tyranny hidden almost "from hilt to point" with Imperial rescripts and Papal decretals one might as soon call a statue with a dagger in one hand and a cup of poison in the other by the name of Hope  TYRANNY in the principle of a law sometimes begets absolute relaxation in the administration of it its effects in other instances may not go quite so far the administration of it may only be∣come mild And this appears to have been the case with respect to the statute of treason in England and by an error into which men very easily fall the spirit with which the law was admini∣stered has been mistaken for the spirit of the law itself This has been the case with the law under consideration  But it is urged that  it is an infringement to the liberties of the subject to increase this catalogue of treasons and when any additions have been made to the statute of Edward the Third in former ages the experience of our forefathers has taught them the necessity of taking them away and restoring its former simplicity to the law on this head  There are reasons why more and more severe and unjust laws may be expected to be found in every State under this title than under any other but that is not the general character of the laws of treason which have been made in this country since the Revolution Will any person contend that the four Acts which placed the Princes of the House of Hanover upon the Throne and secured them there were not absolutely necessary to be made in aid of the statute of Edward for the preservation of their liberties Their destruction is menaced now by a different set of enemies described neither by these laws nor that of Edward and further provisions against  them  are necessary  II THE authors of the statute itself declare that it is inade∣quate to the prevention or punishment of many acts of treason which may be equal in criminality to those it defines They admit that "other like cases of treason may happen in time to come" and their inability to think of or declare them but they pro∣mise to provide for them as they shall arise one after another by a series of  ex pest facto  laws or judgments  BEFORE this Act passed the number of treasons by the common law was greatly multiplied In seven cases it continues the cognizance of that crime to the ordinary courts as before and establishes a new mode of proceeding upon all others but subversive of the very funda∣mental principles of Legislation ordinarily observed in the milder simple Monarchies That great and excellent Lawyer Sir Matthew Hale saw clearly what the Act itself admits that the enumera∣tion of treasons contained in it was not so complete as to preclude the necessity of additions to it in future and he lays down the constitutional mode of providing for these omitted cases as they shall arise in the following terms  That as the authoritative  decision of the  casus omissi  is reserved to the king and Parlia∣ment the most regular way to do it is by a declarative Act  Bl Com v p    The authors of the two Bills have therefore followed the autho∣rity of Sir Matthew Hale and the precedents of those great men who seated the House of Hanover on the Throne In what sense such an Act is to be declaratory must be explained It is not to be understood as declarative of the meaning of the clauses of the th of Edward the Third defining certain treasons but of the law with respect to the  casus omissus  the object of the new Act supposed to have been left as shown above treason at the com∣mon law but under particular circumstances as triable only in Parliament The mode of speaking Sir Matthew Hale here makes use of is founded on that legal fiction that the common law is a code absolutely perfect therefore  it expounds the several spe∣cies of temporal offences  Bl Com v p  perfectly  as always intending to conform to the perfection of reason  Ib p    Hence it must al∣ways intend to be coextensive to the necessities of prevention or punishment in all possible cases of treason But in cases of which no legal record can be found it is of absolute necessity that the Executive Power should not have the dangerous authority of de∣claring what that perfect code says the Legislature is alone com∣petent to do it by a declaratory Act Hence Hale calls such an Act declaratory  THUS the possible necessity of additions to the statute of Edward is proved by the express admission of the statute itself the expedience of making them by the Acts on the Hanoverian Suc∣cession which preserved the Constitution and that  the most regular way  has in this instance been pursued we have the testimony of Lord Chief Justice Hale  the most brilliant exam∣ple to his own age and to posterityof exact justice and profound jurisprudence  Burnet in Burke's Letter to a Member c p    AFTER an act is committed to determine whether it falls under an assigned title in the criminal laws belongs to the Executive Power but when Parliament assumes this function as directed by the statute of Edward there is a union of the Legislative and Executive Powers in the same hands which constitutes and is the very definition of arbitrary power however vested We are not to define what the imperative voice of extreme necessity that of the supreme law the  salus populi  may sometimes demand the utmost efforts of human wisdom cannot annihilate this necessity perpetually the best municipal laws diminish it the most To leave excesses to be suppressed by the former law when it can be effected by the latter is to leave the fate of Society in a certain degree to depend on the conflict of anarchy and arbitrary power and to define one more of the crimes leading to that necessity the  object of each of these Bills and provide against it by an express law is a triumph of legal government over both  WHEN danger threatens the citadel of the Constitution from a new quarter new works must be cast up to defend it and their construction must vary with the mode of attack However the defence of the two Bills is not confined to that ground the de∣fences on the quarter on which the assailants make their ap∣proach were masked the embrasures are now opened and they see their danger fairly before the attack Pursuant also to the humaner laws of war the former charges of the guns rusty nails broken glass and old iron are drawn and they are fairly shot∣ted  On this occasion I must retract what I have said in defence of a censure passed by Mr Reeves on some modern reformers whom he supposed to consider a good Constitution in theory as of more consequence than a good Constitution in practice or effective liberty It certainly ought to be mitigated now we see that they are willing and desirous of making an unreserved sacrifice of what the theory of the Constitution has acquired by the two laws to obtain a little practical anarchy  No II ON THE CHARACTER OF THE AGE OF EDWARD THE THIRD  WHEN we draw together the scattered notices which our his∣torians have given us of the progress this nation had made in general knowledge in the age of Edward the Third we seem to be surveying a sketch of the ideas and transactions of an enlight∣ened period immediately preceding our own and if they had so arranged their materials this conclusion must have presented itself to them and they would certainly have been able by their re∣searches to have collected many more instances of a like charac∣ter to establish this observation than can be here brought for∣ward  THE politics of England with respect to foreign countries were then the same as those systematically embraced at and since the Revolution a triple alliance of England Germany and the Low Countries against France  THE religious principles of that period as Hume himself admits had very nearly anticipated thoso of the Reformation Wickliffe preached its doctrines and the laity were desirous of flinging off the Papal obedience Edward availed himself of this  revolution of opinions as far as it suited his purpose and no fur∣ther He referred the Pope's claim of tribute to the Parliament who supported him in withholding it on the ground that the act of John being without the national consent could not change the tenure by which he held the Crown The statute against provisors was passed in this reign and all appeals to Rome were prohibited  IF the House of Commons had not attained its present weight in the Constitution its privileges were extended so far that they were on the very point of establishing it Hume calls the inter∣position of the Court in elections to the House the first symptom of established liberty Every art was then used to secure to "the King's friends and men in place" seats in that Assembly This abuse was remonstrated against and with success  Hist v p  He anticipated the practice of this age of applying to Parliament for an approbation of measures drawing expence after them before he engaged in them that he might thereon ground his future demands for supply  V p  The Commons sometimes remonstrated with Edward with severity and they obliged him to dismiss his mistress The Clergy in a dispute with him charged him with a design of introducing the practice of imposing taxes without consent of parliament  Ib  that is to subvert a Constitution already understood  e had practised it occasionally and given his negative to an Act to punish the taxgatherers  IN this reign likewise Parliament made retrenchments of the prerogative and especially the giving up of the claim of pur∣ve  ance and two of the greater feudal aids the price of a libe∣ral supply Edward afterward d  genuously eluded his conces∣sion  Ib  Among the grievances they remonstrated against and kept within bounds were the powers assumed by the Privy Council and Star Chamber the dispensing power monopolies and pressing they limited the prerogative of Parliament and remonstrated against its abuses and the stopping of justice by warrant  Ib  And the power of issuing writs to levy shipmoney was abolished in the laver end of this reign or the beginning of the following  V p    THE Commons in this age also understood the privileges vested in them in consequence of their having the custody of the national purse with accuracy and at least in their full extent The merchants having agreed with the King to augment the duty upon some article of export wool I believe were sum∣moned before the House and censured for breach of privilege the only precedent which I suppose can be properly urged against the subject supplying the Crown with money voluntarily a point tacitly given up by the Petition of Right an article of  which is  that no man shall be  compelled  to yield any gift loan or benevolence tax or such like charge without common consent by act of parliament  Bl Com v p    which by prohibiting com∣pulsive levies  tacitly establishes the legality of voluntary contri∣butions and is in effect a regulating clause not a prohibition  THE hereditary claim of the Crown to some duties on expor∣tation was already a point of discussion and jealousy to the people on the accession of Richard the Second and in the expedient the Commons made use of to establish their rights without detri∣ment to the revenue we see a refinement and dexterity which has seldom been equalled they were ordered to cease at Mid∣summer and to be renewed on the Feast of St Peter the interval being five days  Hume Hist v p on wools woolfells and skins    for that thereby the King should be inter∣rupted for claiming such grant as due  The same Assembly annexed a strict clause of appropriation to the supplies they granted and took effectual care of their observance by appoint∣ing some of their own Members to superintend the receipt and disbursements of the sum levied  Ib p    A CERTAIN modern practice and esteemed of a more ambi∣guous merit was in this age first perhaps adopted since the time of the Romans In the reign of Edward the Third we discover the first instance of a public debt on parliamentary security it was voted that the King should take up sacks of wool on the credit of an aid for two years the value to be repaid out of the produce of that aid The amount of the advance Mr Hume states at l  Hume v p  but on the authority of an extremely well informed writer its least value must be taken at l  On the qualified Exportation of Wool discussed historically p  GREAT freedom was made use of in this period in the de∣bates of the Commons Those on the subject of Alice Pierce mentioned above are sufficient proof of this Edward likewise sometimes imprisoned the Speakers  after the breaking up of a Parliament  If our annals were complete we should find England then possessed her Hampdens and Falklands her Hydes and her Pyms But the great Commoners of that age could only impress upon the Constitution a quiet and progressive amelioration not bury it under the ruins of legal prerogative Edward the Third sat upon the Throne not Charles the First  THE minority of Richard the Second suggested further views to the Commons they then first chose a Speaker and it is sin∣gular that the election fell on Peter de la Marc whom the late King had imprisoned for his speeches in a preceding Parliament That House was the first to take up the business of the Regency  petitioning the Lords that a Council of Nine might be appointed to carry on the public affairs during the King's minority and although their interposition was in that form they were of con∣sequence enough to carry their point But another extension of power which they aimed at that all the great Officers should be appointed by Parliament during that minority that is that the Commons should have a negative on all such appointments they failed in Before this Parliament was dissolved they affirmed the right and the necessity of that Assembly meeting once in each year  CIRCUMSTANCES which happened soon after repressed the further exertions of this rising spirit of freedom in the House of Commons which the vigour and glory of Edward the Third could not effect The insurrection of Wat Tyler must have infused no little jealousy of popular principles into the minds of men of property of both Houses in the same manner as we saw the insurrection of Lord George Gordon produce the defeat of some popular measures which were carrying on when it com∣menced with great appearance of success It was thus this salu∣tary check upon abuses the importance of the Lower House losing much of its vigour England soon came to experience all the calamities in which the contests of a disorderly feeble pre∣cipitate Court and a factious Nobility could involve a nation terminating in a long period of degradation and misery  A FEW miscellaneous circumstances will be here added to shew that this nation was in other respects in a very advanced state at this period Mr Chalmers in his Comparative Estimate informs us that land at the death of Edward the Third sold for twentyfive years purchase A scene of turbulence and revolu∣tion commenced soon after In the reign of Henry the Fourth we see in the history of the times that it was fallen to twenty and in that of Edward the Fourth to ten years purchase Pre∣sently after the accession of the House of Hanover it reattained the value it had sold for at the accession of Richard the Second The modern maxims of commerce were then likewise understood To rival the trade of the Netherlands their manufacturers were invited to settle in this kingdom the exportation of unwrought wool was prohibited and the wearing of foreign cloths and it was declared by law that  trade should be free  notwithstanding grants or usages  seeing such are to the common prejudice  Qual Export of Wool p    Our foreign commerce likewise brought us in a balance of l  Biog Brit art "Clarke"  ayear of the money of that time containing the fame quantity or silver as l of our present money which sum it did not on an average exceed in the period from the Restora∣tion to the Revolution  THE French language was in this age prohibited in law pro∣ceedings and the history of English literature affords a strong proof of the degree of the refinement of manners to which we had then attained This is exhibited in the characters and some of the tales of Chaucer Polite satire and comic portraits touched with a light and free pencil can only be produced by men of genius who live in periods very much civilized Let the ability of the writer be what it will the characters drawn in a semibarbarous age have little of individual nature in them they all have the allegorical air of moral qualities personified Athens had acquired its highest degree of politeness when Menander wrote his comedies France did not produce her Moliere until the age of Louis the Fourteenth and the latter will not be found much more free from the delineation of abstract qualities instead of living characters or from overcharged colouring than our own countryman the delicacy of whose hand certainly was not surpassed by that of Theophrastus or La Bruyere and if we grant his taste outstripped that of his age more than any of those writers mentioned above still that age in which he lived must have been highly civilized before it could produce such a writer or feel the beauties of his comic manner His page in∣deed is disgraced with some gross immoralities but it is only to be wished that this could be urged as a proof he did not write in a polished period The works of the Augustan age and those written in France since the death of Louis the Thirteenth by men who have in the same manner disgraced fine abilities and a fine taste will not suffer this to be urged against the consequences drawn from the poetry of Chaucer  NOT only the manner in which these characters were drawn decides upon that of the age it may be also shewn from the matter they contain in that of the  Squyer  we may be supposed to have an account of the education of the young gentry of Eng∣land at that period Among his other qualifications he made verses was instructed in drawing and music and as we express ourselves wrote a fine hand and he had made a tour in the provinces of Flanders then the seat of opulence Nor is the poet here describing what in his opinion the education of a young gentleman ought to be but what it was the former is to be seen in that of his own son Lowys who although he did not exceed the age of ten years had already acquired the elements of the La∣tin language and made a considerable progress in arithmetic and the doctrine of proportion he earnestly desired to be taught astronomy and his father thought him to be so sufficiently qua∣lified that he complied with his request and wrote his Treatise on the Astrolabe for his use In his preface he supposes his work on astronomy might be generally read  THIS excellent direction to the national education and objects of pursuit was most probably given to them by the writings and  recent discoveries of Roger Bacon born not only to restore what is worth retaining of the ancient philosophy but to lead it far on toward the perfection it has since attained He died about thirtyfive years before the accession of Edward the Third  HISTORIANS seem tacitly to have laid it down as an hypo∣thesis that Society has been in a progressive state of improvement ever since the union of the Saxon kingdoms Hence they are perpetually expressing their wonder at the repeated instances of policy and refinement occurring in the period here treated of But our advancement was then great it could not be called a semibarbarous age it can only be said of it that it still retained traces of barbarism It was not only the dawn of the day or the first beams of the rising sun which enlightened our ancestors that luminary was already mounted many degrees above the horizon some flying clouds indeed which the wind was dissipating at intervals obscured it for a little time or cast a dark moving tract of shadow over the landscape  A TURBULENT and disastrous period of civil war and usurpations ensued a short and dazzling term of military splendor which promised to terminate only served ultimately to increase its calamities The acquisitions of the age of Ed∣ward the Third were lost almost as soon as made After the civil wars were ended the heavy domination of the Tudors long repressed the efforts of the genius of this nation to recover that height from whence it had fallen and thus the reign of genuine science in Europe destined to be esta∣blished by Britain was postponed between two and three cen∣turies by our internal commotions begun by a general in∣surrection of the populace of eight counties round the capital "on the principles of primitive equality  Hume's Hist v iii p  " and directed to "the purpose of levelling all mankind"  No III ON A LEADING CAUSE OF THE CIVIL WARS IN THE REIGN OF CHARLES THE SECOND  I DO not know that it has been observed that a single fact accounts for the unrelenting vehemence of the illegal mea∣sures against Lord Strafford the famous inflammatory remon∣strance  the rash attempt of the King to seize the five Mem∣bers and the continuation of the attack of the Commons upon the royal power after they had restored the Constitution  COUNT LallyTolendal in his Life of Lord Strafford a work full of curiosity and elegance informs us that he had possessed himself of legal proofs of treason against the Lords Saville and Kimbolton and Pym Strode and their accom∣plices as having called a foreign enemy the Scots into Eng∣land Mr Hume informs us that if Lord Strafford had not been suddenly prevented by the accusation of the Commons he had that very day it was thought charged Pym Hamp∣den and others with treason on that account Now Hamp∣den Pym and Strode were three of the five Members ac∣cused by the King the other two were Hollis and Sir Ar∣thur Hazlerig I lay it down as a probable supposition that they were among  those others  not directly named by these writers  THOUGH the thanks of the House had been given to the Scots for their brotherly assistance in marching into England an Act of indemnity had been procured by those who invited them  Hume v vi p affirms that an Act of oblivion had passed The public Acts of the Long Parliament which received the royal assent are in number nineteen their titles are now lying before me There is no such Act of oblivion among them The title of the th is "An Act for Confirma∣tion of the Treaty of Pacification between England and Scotland with Com∣missions and Articles thereupon" If this Act had contained such a clause of oblivion and indemnity it would have been recited in a title which particular∣rizes commissions and articles It contained indeed "A Provision for the Security of his Majesty's Party in Scotland in reference to all former trou∣bles excluding only the Scotch Bishops and four more of that nation" Hey∣lin's Life of Laud p But this does not amount to an indemnity for treasons committed in England If a law was passed for that purpose Hume does not mention this remarkable Act in its proper place He might be led into error by supposing the thanks of the Houses to the Scots for their bro∣therly assistance to be a virtual Act of oblivion for their inviters Besides if the King had passed an Act of indemnity is it probable that he would have attempted to bring the five Members to a trial who might have pleaded it or that the Commons would not have reproached him for an attempt to violate an Act to which he had given his assent  some of those even who thought the nation benefited by that measure might dislike the precedent and the actors therein might fear to disclose the part they had taken so far as to solicit such a safeguard they remained therefore under the penalties of the law of Treason and thought themselves reduced to act upon that most dreadful of all maxims  ne fe∣riare feri meurs ou tue  Corneille Cid  " Strafford was possessed of the fullest evidence  Preuves irresistibles Count L T p  against them and they determined at the  proper instant to anticipate his attack upon them but this could not be done with safety to them when the person of the Earl was out of their reach Hence it was necessary for other causes than those commonly alledged that their plan of a counteraccusation should be for a season unknown to him for this reason the doors of the House were locked at the time they thought proper that the subject of his impeach∣ment should come on that no intelligence of their intended measure should transpire until it was too late for him to an∣ticipate their accusation by his own Thus those of the Com∣mons who were in the secret flung their deliberations against him rather into the form of a private consultation of con∣spirators than the debates of a senate This apprehension of their own danger led them at last to the unprecedented and double form of their proceeding against him the parts of which were a trial for treason instituted in the ordinary form before the Peers which was interrupted by the prosecutors themselves before sentence was suffered to be given by a new course of proceedings a bill of attainder What they could do consistently with their apprehensions for their own safety to avoid this species of necessity of committing a murder by what had so equivocal an appearance of being the sword of the law they attempted Count Lally on the authority of the Journal of Archbishop Laud informs us that Lord Lon∣don and the most powerful of the Presbyterians offered to Lord Strafford his life and liberty on condition that he should join them and that he refused the proposition  Essay Histor p  "  IT is obvious they must have conjectured that the train of their negociations with the Scots was perfectly known to the King though he might not be master of the legal evidence This might confirm them in their plan of continuing their own power by perpetuating the sitting of the Parliament after that assembly had been made triennial that the danger might meet them com∣bined together in perfect union with and at the head of a great party in both Houses  The King's journey into Scotland was a real subject of alarm to this party they dreaded that he should be able to obtain more particular information against them and finding that by their importunity they were not able so much as to get him to put it off they appointed a Committee to attend upon him under pretence of seeing the articles of pacification executed but in reality to be spies upon his conduct  Hume vol vi p  One of the most eminent of the Members who had concurred in the invitation was among these deputies  CHARLES when in Scotland by a liberal distribution of ti∣tles and such favours as remained in his power had attached the leading Covenanters to him for a time and obtained their con∣fidence "He expostulated with some of the chief among them touching their late coming into England in a hostile man∣ner and found that some who were now leading men in the Houses of Parliament had invited them to it" and he "fur∣nished himself with some proofs of it  Heylin's Life of Laud p  " The Committee whom the Parliament had sent to watch his conduct in Scotland could not be entirely ignorant of these communications nor would they fail to signify this increase of danger to those of the two Houses who were affected by it Thus some of the Covenanters betrayed their confederates to the King This pre∣pares us for what is to follow The Earl of Leve  who had on his knees protested in the house of the Earl of Kinnoul that he would never bear arms against the King in a little more than two years after led for the third time a Scotch army into Eng∣land A liberal subsidy from the Parliament had again changed the inclinations of some bad men of that nation and a second prevailed upon them to give up their Sovereign The confi∣dence also which Charles reposed in the discoveries he had made which he preserved as a last resource to protect him against the machinations of his enemies in England proved unexpectedly one of the great causes of his ruin  THE dangerous situation of those who invited the Scots into England became daily in their own eyes more and more evident When he went into Scotland "it was voiced to all that he parted a gracious King from a contented people  Baker  " His tour into that kingdom had greatly strengthened his interests there he was become extremely popular in this city as was evident in his splendid reception on his return and his party in the House of Commons was already equal and becoming supe∣rior to theirs The accusation against them they must have known to have been strengthened with new evidence that the business of the Parliament would be soon finished and that as∣sembly of course dissolve itself and they return into the mass of private subjects amenable to the course of law their fears for their safety urged them therefore to renew the attack upon the King by exciting the populace of the city afresh against him and they hoped likewise by a series of measures of irritation to provoke him into some precipitate measures that might revive those resentments against his pas administration which think∣ing men began to wish to be forgotten and that by these means in conjunction they might so far debase his character and dimi∣nish his power that they might have nothing to fear from his  accusations even after the dissolution of Parliament whenever they should permit it to take place By a single measure they se∣cured the first of their purposes exciting new tumults against the King nor could any step be more calculated to commence their system of irritation  THIS was the voting and publishing the famous Remonstrance addressed by the Commons to the People against the King con∣taining every thing with which his whole administration had been truly or falsely accused eac  particular heightened with all the arts of exaggeration There is historical evidence that the fears of this active party in the House for their own safety were their motives to this step so instrumental in kindling the Civil War for immediately after the passing of it Cromwell told Lord Falk∣land "that if the Remonstrance had not been carried he was resolved to have converted the small remains of his estate into ready money the next day and to have taken the first occasion of quitting the kingdom and this he affirmed was the senti∣ment also of some of the most considerable men of the party  Biog Brit Cromwell v iv from Clarendon  " Many additional insults followed the Remonstrance before the King was provoked to what he had unfortunately confided in as a strong resource his impotent and unfortunate attempt of seizing the five Members to bring them to a trial for treason while they were yet at the head of a victorious party the House of Lords in consternation and the irritated and licentious populace of London at their command  IT seems therefore highly probable that the use intended to be made by Lord Strafford of the evidence he had procured cost him his life that the fear of its effects likewise produced the Remonstrance and the further unconstitutional attempts upon the royal power which followed it for after the sanguinary ex∣ample those who had joined in the invitation of the Scots had exhibited in the case of Lord Strafford that they might not suf∣fer for what was treason by law they were compelled to become in reality traitors  They took arms against the King to wrest the militia from him This would have destroyed the Constitution then existing but this Constitution was in principle and powers much more popular than that defined by the Bill of Rights as will be particularly shewn in the next article  The expectation likewise which the King founded upon the same testimonies betrayed him into the fatal error of attempting to seize the five Members which ultimately cost him his crown and life  YET there was every thing to fear for our liberties at the time the Scotch insurrection began the actual possession of them was almost totally to be regained At the accession of Charles a good deal of the canker of a dangerous prerogative crusted over many a tooth of some of the main wheels of the Constitu∣tion  We know that a little oil dexterously poured in would at that time have kept the whole in constant motion the wheels might even thus have scoured themselves bright and the ma∣chine have gone very well It was not applied and they be∣came absolutely clogged with rust Two of the constituent parts of the Legislature seemed to have lost the exercise of their proper functions  From the time of the invitation of the Scotch to enter into England in to the time the bill for the militia was brought forward a complete re∣volution in the Constitution of our government had taken place It may be of use to compare it with that of as to its necessity the means by which it was effected and its magnitude The measure of the necessity of each seems equal or nearly so Charles endeavoured to rule without Parliaments Some foreign sovereigns had succeeded in annihilating similar assemblies by bringing them into disuse James copied in part the policy of Augustus to enslave the Romans veiling absolute power under old names revered in times of liberty He did not attempt to annihilate Parliament indeed but he en∣deavoured to get into his hands the effective nomination of four hundred and twentyone members  Defence of the Letter attributed to Mr Reeves p  of the House of Commons so destroy the essence while he kept up the appearance and forms of the popular branch of the Constitution I shall now give a brief view of the means by which these two Revolutions were effected The authors of the Revolution of invited a foreign army to their assistance of a Protestant nation the natural and old al∣lies of the kingdom under the husband of a princess claiming to be pre∣sumptive heiress of the Crown The necessity fully justified this measure but under these circumstances it appears stronger than the invitation to the Scots in for though their army may he regarded as foreign they were subject  to the same King not to insist on another point of difference it appears therefore that in this respect the calling in of the Scots upon the existing ne∣cessity was likewise fully justified and moreover by that of the subsequent in∣vitation of the Prince of Orange The magnitude of the two Revolutions are compared in the next article wherein it is shewn that before the claim of the militia in the Constitution had been rendered in principle and ef∣fect more popular than by the Bill of Rights it was therefore not more con∣stitutional at that period in the Parliament to take arms still further to in∣crease the popular power in the Constitution than it would have been imme∣diately after the passing of the Bill of Rights for the party who invited over the Prince of Orange to have involved the nation in a civil war to have reduced the kingly power of William to much narrower limits than those defined by that great declarative law  After these obstructions were removed the dignity of the letter of the law should have been preserved by an act of indemnity a reparation always due to it when absolute necessity demands a temporary veil to be flung over it a conciliating libe∣rality  Pym saw the expedience of this He had been made Chancellor of the Exchequer and declared that he had found effective ways and means to make a considerable augmentation to the revenue of the Crown but the price he set upon his service was the head of Strafford  Vi  de St Compte L T    to obviate the more urgent necessities of the Crown would have been patriotism and the very powerful leaders of  the House by falling upon such a system would have deserved and might have obtained a cordial oblivion and even the affec∣tions of the Sovereign and the gratitude of the people and the island might now be able to boast that it had enjoyed a firm regular and free government of a century and a half instead of a century but an avarice which had the appearance of want of good faith disgraced the spirit of liberty in the beginning of the reign of Charles and ultimately almost annihilated liberty itself while it defeated its own impolitic ends by the immense expence of the Civil Wars of which it was the primary cause all the other calamities being set out of the question The plan of rendering the Executive Power duly analogous to the principles of the Constitution and the means by which it was pursued then had an unnecessary difference of character The acrimony of Par∣liament which Charles perhaps considered alternately with some∣thing of fear and more of indignation and the love of prero∣gative made him desire to raise himself above the legal Consti∣tution he seemed for a long time to have succeeded an ade∣quate reparation had been obtained but he fell and the Consti∣tution fell with him  No IV A VINDICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ASSO∣CIATION OF THE ROYALISTS IN THE CIVIL WARS  IT is certain that there were great changes wanted in go∣vernment when the Parliament of met the point to be enquired into therefore is Whether the amount of the acquisi∣tions made by the popular part thereof were not such before the King set up his standard and the Royalists pledged themselves to him in the defence of his remaining prerogatives that no∣thing farther was requisite unattainable in the ordinary course of legislation without civil war It is contended here that the King's concessions had effectively formed a new constitution of government although no experiment was suffered to be made of it which Constitution was at least as popular as was neces∣sary to the enjoyment of the freedom compatible with a mixed monarchy  IT may be said  that this question is of the nature of those concerning the degree in which a certain quality is found resident in its subject which as it is capable of infinite variations can∣not be defined by language although it may be the object of  perception much less can we determine and describe with pre∣cision that very degree of any quality which carries its subject to the highest perfection of its nature as far as it depends thereon or to an assigned point towards it in short that the question here proposed is incapable of any accurate decision as all that can be urged on either side must be drawn from general topics of declamation and what they can furnish upon this head was exhausted at the time the Civil Wars were a recent sub∣ject  BUT no age is perhaps competent to decide on all the doubt∣ful but important points which may arise in it Even the expe∣rience of facts to take place in the course of the next century if we were masters of it might give us certainty now in many points in which we lose ourselves in vague declamation and the lapse of time has enabled us to discuss this question upon ade∣quate experience  WHEN a Constitution has been tried for a century and we find by the experience of the whole term that it contains the popular principle in a due proportion we have therein a fixed standard to judge another Constitution by and if we find the fundamental principles of the latter more popular than those of the former we are intitled to pronounce that upon trial it would have been found at least fully adequate to support the freedom of the people  Now on this subject we possess such a standard of comparison We find it in that great declaratory Act the Bill of Rights which perpetuated to the popular part of the constitution of govern∣ment the possession of every right requisite for the enjoyment of true liberty or asserted such powers to belong thereunto that whatever farther was wanted was easily acquired in the regular and ordinary course of legislation a bill by the operation of which the proportion of the two rival powers the monarchical and the popular has become so nicely adjusted that they have been preserved ever since in an equilibrio so nice that the finest index has in very few instances been able to point out the slightest vibration in the balance much less has it been subject to those violent and alternate exaltations and depressions of prero∣gative and privilege which in the last century so often threaten∣ed overset it  IF therefore it can be shewn that the popular part of the Constitution was stronger after the concessions of Charles and before the last demands were made upon him which were re∣sisted by arms than the authors of the Bill of Rights chose to render it then the Royalists who pledged themselves to the maintenance of all the laws and constitutions already passed in that Parliament and the defence of the royal power so limited did not endeavour to put a stop to the acquisitions of the popular  branch of the Constitution prematurely or before it had attain∣ed a due degree of strength  WE are now to go into a comparison of the acquisitions of the Parliament of before the demand of the militia and some particulars of the Bill of Rights And first with respect to the constituent branches of the Legislature The Bishops votes had been abolished by Act of Parliament whereby the influence of the Crown in the Upper House had been much weakened the Bill of Rights tacitly admits them The meetings of Parlia∣ment had been made triennial in by the Bill of Rights it is only enacted that Parliaments should be frequently held It was only by a subsequent statute passed in the th year of the reign of William "that this indefinite frequency was again re∣duced to a certainty  Black Com v i p  " And among the Acts of Parliament of Charles to the support of which the Royalists had pledged themselves was that which ordained that the Parliament then sitting should not be prorogued or dissolved but by its own con∣sent Hence the King's power in the legislature was left much stronger by the Bill of Rights than by the Acts of and the authors of that Bill declined to prescribe those limitations of kingly power in this respect which the Royalists engaged them∣selves to support  THE remaining heads of this comparison will relate to the executive power of the Crown judicial and military and first as to the independence of the courts of law on the personal will of the Sovereign At the request of his Parliament Charles had called in all the Judges patents and issued to them new ones "during good behaviour" His two successors re∣stored the old form in these instruments the Judges again held their offices "during their good pleasure" and the Bill of Rights made no alteration therein The form adapted by Charles the First on the application of his Parliament was afterwards restored by Will III c The Royalists therefore had ad∣mitted stronger limitations on the King in his judicial capacity than those great men who effected the Revolution chose to im∣pose upon him  IT remains to examine how the King's military powers were left standing upon both these grounds By the Bill of Rights to keep up a standing army in time of peace without the con∣sent of Parliament was declared to be illegal but before the rupture the Long Parliament had established a precedent which went much farther The King offered to raise ten thousand vo∣lunteers for the service of the Irish wars the Commons put a negative upon this and to the right of the Parliament to a ne∣gative in this point he tacitly submitted by assenting to a Bill to  raise men upon the authority of that assembly and by this Act the pressing of men by royal warrant was declared to be illegal The practice was afterwards revived and by the Bill of Rights no provision was made against it so much less were the limita∣tions of the Crown declared by that Act than those the asso∣ciated Royalists engaged to maintain the observance of they therefore agreed to support the national liberties in greater strength than the authors of the Bill of Rights thought proper to declare for The merits of these excellent men stand between the Royalists and all censure and that Act itself is a redoubt which must be levelled to the ground before their assailants can march forward to attack the principles of their Association It is a work they must not leave behind them  AN objection may be made to this  that the feudal tenures were not abolished nor the Habeas Corpus passed until the Re∣storation  To this it is answered that they might both have been obtained without a civil war either by compact or the ordinary course of legislation It is true the revenue from the wards of the Crown and some other feudal incidents remained These were compounded for soon after the Restoration and Charles and the Royalists would have willingly concurred in their abolition on the same terms for the first proposition on this ac∣count came from the Crown to the Parliament in the reign of James the First who offered to give them up for an adequate tax on the lands out of which such contingent payments issued Charles the First would without doubt have exchanged them for the hereditary excise and the additional recompence after∣ward obtained for them by his son and his party certainly would not have engaged in the dangers of a Civil War to avoid exo∣nerating their estates of those payments on the like advantageous terms to themselves  IT is to be remarked also that in the Parliament of an Act had already passed "That if any person be restrained of his liberty by any illegal court or by command of the King's Majesty in person or by warrant of the councilboard or of any of the Privy Council  Black Com v i p  " he should be entitled to a writ of Habeas Corpus From the temper of the times in which this Act was obtained it certainly went as far as the experience of the past or the foresight of the future grievances of arbitrary imprison∣ment could then extend and it is not credible that the improve∣ments afterward ingrafted upon it existed even in contempla∣tion  THE statute called by way of eminence the Habeas Corpus Act passed in the reign of Charles the Second It points out  the means of obtaining this writ more clearly and enforces them more strongly but the weaknesses of the provisions of the former were certainly unknown in as no experience could have been had of them between the time of this Act passing and the breaking out of the Civil War But if they had then been sus∣pected it is easy to prove they would have been provided for with facility for the Parliament had fallen upon the practice of granting the tonnage and poundage from time to time and for terms of a few months only A more permanent settlement of it would in his own esteem have been a very liberal price for adding to the Habeas Corpus Act he had already granted what was wanted to give full effect to the spirit of it which is proved from this circumstance Charles the Second passed this Act long after this revenue was settled on him for life without obtaining any supply to the necessities in which he was then involved  A FURTHER confirmation of the facility with which these sa∣lutary Acts might have been obtained appears in the historians of this period They inform us that before any signal reverse of fortune checked the progress of the arms of Charles he appears to have been prepared to have made any concession of this kind that might have been judged necessary These sentiments he de∣clared in a manner which shews beside that they had the concur∣rence of him party for about the end of December in his summons to the Oxford Parliament be expresses his desire that "his subjects should be confirmed in those rights which he had granted them in Parliament and his readiness  to add such new grace  as he should find would most conduce to their happiness  Neale's History of Puritans v iii p from Grey's Examination p  " These are very large concessions to have obtained these laws the Royalists would have thought the purchase high enough and so far forth as the liberties of the people and the crown revenues are concerned in such a compact they would have stood exactly on the same footing as they did in the reign of William after the Revo∣lution was duly consolidated  BUT no doubt can be entertained that the Parliament of Charles the First would have attained these points in the ordinary and le∣gislative course of proceeding The King and the Royalists had given a firm engagement that that assembly should retain all its newacquired powers At the Restoration they ceased to possess them yet the popular constituent part of the Legislature thus weakened was able to obtain them if therefore the assembly at Westminster giving up all their last demands upon the King had concurred with the Royalists upon the terms of their decla∣ration they would have been able to have given to England a Constitution at least as free as is consistent with limited monarchy or has ever been possessed in this country and a system of laws  imposing as few restraints upon personal property or freedom as a wellgoverned State can possess  No V ON THE CONDUCT OF OLIVER CROMWELL FROM THE SIEGE OF EXETER TO HIS JUNCTION WITH THE REPUBLICANS▪  THE personal history of Cromwell from the time in which he rose into conspicuous eminence is a legitimate part of the his∣tory of the nation great national events having had as full a de∣pendence on his measures and plans as they ordinarily have upon those of lawful princes I shall here state his conduct in this pe∣riod in order to confirm the general delineation of it given in the preceding Tract with somewhat of that particularity and distinct∣ness which its importance requires  THERE can be nothing more useful at present than the conside∣ration of his transactions at that period It exhibits one conse∣quence of the interposition of the lower classes of the people in the transactions of Government the degradation of society into that melancholy state in which it resembles the serpent called Am∣phisboena a production of the imagination of the painter or the poet whose tail is frequently hurried away with an irresistible propensity to take the lead of its head This despotic empire of the little over the great so often established when the spirit of commotion has been for any period diffused among the common people was never more fully displayed than when the intriguing and determined genius of Cromwell was forced to bow down to it  So early as the siege of Exeter in the beginning of the year he had been looking out for a negociation with the King on the footing of restoring him "to his just and ancient rights" The reasons he alledged for this to Sir John Barkley are unan∣swerably just yet mark the depth and ambition of the man  Ludlow v p from the MSS of Sir J B  After the King was delivered up by the Scots to the Parliament he was in such close custody  Hume v vii p  that it was impossible for Cromwell to continue his negociations with him By his intrigues a mili∣tary parliament was formed in the camp the regiments chusing representatives called Agitators and the superior officers forming an upper assembly  Ibid p  This military council dispatched Joyce to  bring the King to the Army  Hume v vii p I consider this expedition of Joyce's as partaking more of the nature of a rescue than an imprisonment yet not completely such The King actually refused to be conducted by Fairfax to his former quarters The views of Joyce probably varied perpetually with those of his employers who though intent at this instant upon restoring the King were afterward the persons whoprocured his death But if Joyce had been constant in his en∣mity to him their intentions could not have been more impenetrably veiled than by employing him in this service  Of the attachment of the Agita∣tors to Charles at that time no doubt is to be entertained Sir John Barkley who treated with them on his part gives abundant testimony to it  Ludlow's Memoirs v i p  and this is further confirmed by their letter to Parliament about a month after the King's removal among them by which "they avowed the King's cause to be theirs and that no settlement could be hoped for without granting him his just rights  Whitlock's Memoirs p Biog Brit Cromwell p ▪  " In procuring this declaration Cromwell was very ac∣tive § his professions of attachment to the King as well as to his own relations  Colonel John Cromwell in the Dutch service Biog Brit Cromw Note S  as to the friends of that Prince were full of warmth  Ludlow v i p  The offers to himself and his soninlaw were such as make it impossible to doubt of his sincerity at that time  Hume v vii p    BUT this state of affairs very soon changed the King's most confidential agent Mr Ashburnham declined all communication with the Agitators although their Leaders had promised if it should become necessary to act for the King against Cromwell  The gregarian soldiers and gross of the army is well affected to him though some of the chiefest commander he still avers" Howel's Letters v ii Letter I Date January  and he treated them with avowed contempt  Ludlow v i p  It was at this juncture that the principles of the Levellers which before had in∣fected some parts of the Army began to manifest themselves in the deliberations of this military representative They disclaimed all further connection with the King or with monarchy itself de∣clared for a Republic and wore badges of distinction in their hats This produced a mutiny in the army and with great ha∣zard the mutineers were quelled by Cromwell but in the event be foun  that they were for the present overawed but not sub∣dued that twothirds of the army had pledged themselves to the support of these principles and "the destruction of those who should oppose them  Ibid v i p    " He immediately determined to give way to a torrent he was unable to stem The party he made his  peace with was that most opposite to the King Thus Cromwell himself was forced from a plan of future greatness which he had been two years bringing to maturity and for a time sunk into an instrument in the hands of a military mob To the faction he made his apology by acknowledging  that the glory of the world had so dazzled his eyes that he could not discern clearly the great works that the Lord was doing  Ludlow v p    And to the King's friends he alledged that  it was the act of the Army and not his own  Life of O C p    that  he would serve the King as long as he could do it without his own ruin but desired that it might not be expected that he should perish for his sake  Ludlow v p    I HAVE traced this event with some minuteness as it abounds with curious information on the nature and irresistible impulse of popular commotions We see a military Convention for a time rule the State and soldiers were then the only Citizens If this situation of things had continued and there then existed an external force capable of bringing it to an end the Government of England would have had no remote resemblance to that of Egypt under the Mamalucs We here see likewise the mutabi∣lity and dangers of spurious representations chosen from the lower classes of the people as we find the same individuals offering to compel their superiors to restore the King at one period and in a very few months after actually compelling them to put an end to his life and the Monarchy And the failure of Cromwell in his original aim amounts to a proof that it is impossible in the present state of society for any one let his natural greatness be what it may to conduct any change of government by the means of popular commotions to any end by him foreseen and predeter∣mined He was able indeed to attain afterwards an elevation and greatness he had probably then never contemplated but like Caesar he had always the danger of assassination before him and his apprehensions of it shew that he had not in this respect the courage of the Roman  No VI ON THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE ORDER OF THE SUCCESSION ESTABLISHED AT THE REVOLUTION WITH THE PRINCI∣PLE OF THE HEREDITARY SUCCESSION OF THE CROWN  THE Managers of the House of Commons at the trial of Dr Sacheverel contended that by the Revolution the religion the  liberties and the  "In both these great events the Restoration and Revolution says Sir Joseph Jekyll were the  regal power  and the rights of the people  recovered  " Trial James by substituting a power not regal but despotic in the place of regal power suspended its present and endangered its future existence  Monarchy of England had been preser It appears therefore to have been their opinion that the measures relating to filling the Throne and to the order of succession then established were necessary to the preservation of the Monarchy or that the persons by whom they were effected acted on the prin∣ciples of a Defensive Association on which I have treated in the body of this Tract nor was there any thing in them adverse to the hereditary descent of the Crown for if at that great crisis the Monarchy had fallen and they were all required to preserve it the hereditary succession must have been totally lost Nor are a series of acts to be held inimical to a principle or urged as a precedent or set of precedents against it which approximate toils effects as nearly as possible in the existing circumstances of things or admit only the least possible deviation from it  THE steps taken at the Revolution to regulate the Succession were the following first The declaration of the abdication and the consequent vacancy of the Throne secondly The limitation of the Crown to Protestants thirdly The placing William on the Throne with Mary and fourthly Vesting the royal power in him for life in case he survived her The necessity of each of these for the preservation of the Monarchy from a very apparent danger then threatening it is to be shewn in order  FIRST Men's minds were wrought up to an extraordinary pitch at the time of the Revolution on the subject of the danger of the Protestant religion The most visionary fears of an attempt to introduce Popery had always been able to inflame the people to the utmost That danger then existed perhaps for the first time since the reign of Elizabeth was real and evident The contro∣versy which had been carried on against the Roman Church EXCLUSIVELY by the Clergy of the Establishment with a degree of system of acuteness and of eloquence with which it never had been attacked before by exhibiting its errors in such strong and multiplied points of view had excited the minds of the people with new zeal against the errors of the Romish Church and given collaterally no small degree of weight to the popular apprehend∣sions of this danger by that natural operation by which our aver∣sion to an object increases our fear of it Hence while a Prince of the Papal Communion sat upon the Throne the Republicans would have been aided in pulling it down almost by the whole popular force The abdication of James therefore preserved the Mo∣narchy from the apparent danger of an almost immediate subver∣sion  SECONDLY It had also become necessary to quiet the alarms of the people on account of the future dangers of religion in order to deprive the Republican party entirely of this formidable engine On this ground the limitation of the Crown to Protestants became necessary for perpetuating Kingly Government  THIRDLY Other dangers likewise from the same quarter were sufficient to induce the nation to place William upon the Throne together with Mary for a popular revolution always diminishes the spirit of subordination and Government ought always after such a shock to be put in the strongest state its Constitution permits to guard against all further change And in this case as the necessity of having placed the sceptre in William's hand was clearly demonstrated by the event it must be taken to have been apparent at the time for in little more than a year there appeared a necessity that his whole political vigour should be armed with the whole kingly power to defeat the attempts of the Republicans in the Commons  The spirit of certain measures pursued by the majority of the Commons in the first Parliament of William and Mary has been explained in the Defence of the Letter attributed to Mr Reeves p note  to undermine the constitutional powers of the Crown  FOURTHLY Thus it was evidently requisite that during the joint lives of William and Mary the former should be invested with the whole royal power It is now to be shewn that there was a very probable necessity to induce the Convention to leave the kingly power to William for life A strong case in point plainly indicated that necessity  IN the reign of Henry of Castile Ferdinand then Prince of Arragon had married the King's sister Isabella without his consent During his reign he regarded his brotherinlaw as secretly plot∣ting to deprive him of his Throne His Queen had brought him a daughter whose name was Joanna to whom a large party of his subjects believed his favourite Count Bertran de la Cueva to have been the real father  Guicciardini mentions her only by the name of a Bertramiglia a name I suppose of contempt given her by the party of Ferdinand in Spain and de∣rived from that of her putative father  and King Henry who was supposed incapable of begetting children was accused of having encouraged the adultery of his wife in order to impose a spurious successor upon his people  ON the death of Henry a large party declared for the Princess Isabella his sister who after a short contest was established on the Throne Many of the Nobility were desirous of vesting the sole administration of the kingdom in the Queen others for allowing to King Ferdinand her husband an extremely limited and subor∣dinate share therein thus Ferdinand and Isabella were in the same circumstances as William and Mary about a century after the  title of Joanna the supposed daughter of Henry being still pre∣ferred by many of their subjects and recognized also by the neighbouring King of Portugal The similarity of their conduct was as perfect as that of their situations Ferdinand in this pros∣pect of being disappointed in an object with which his ambition had long flattered him entertained thoughts of returning to his own dominions rather than be a Sovereign in name only in the now opulent kingdom of Castile But Isabella discouraged the party which was desirous of limiting his powers and her efforts in his favour prevailed he was admitted to the exercise of the sovereignty jointly and equally with her  Two other circumstances added to this similitude of the situ∣ations of the joint Sovereigns of Castile and of Britain at these respective periods In the former kingdom  in alm  st all the cities there were factions that kept up a kind of civil war among themselves without paying any respect to the laws or regard to the royal authority  Univ Hist v p    The latter had recently been involved in the most dangerous internal commotions in which the spirit of Republicanism triumphant a few years before seemed to revive and these had been rather imperfectly smo∣thered than suppressed For so violent were the tumults of the Petitioners and Abhorrers in that nothing which preceded the Civil Wars according to the testimony of a cotemporary observer  Coke's Detection  more strongly presaged such a calamity They con∣tinued to the dissolution of the Parliament at Oxford After that period indeed a remission of the fever of the national spirit took place but so little resembling a termination of it that the pro∣bability of its breaking out again with additional violence was apparent In the natural constitution particular disorders are seen to degenerate into others of a different and far more dangerous character and in Spain the simple spirit of sedition for nothing appeared further at the first became converted afterwards into that of a turbulent democracy but in England a large portion of the latter had all along been discernibly mixed with the other causes of dissention peculiar to the times The danger of Eng∣land therefore from the principles of democracy was greater at the Revolution than that of Castile at the accession of Ferdinand if we had copied the errors of the latter kingdom  THE situation of the new Sovereigns of the two States with respect to the national churches were also nearly the same The Primate of Spain the Archbishop of Toledo had been very active in the party of Isabella and Ferdinand but ultimately espoused that of Joanna The Archbishop of Canterbury had zealously opposed the usurpation of James the event of that opposition seems even to have finished the alienation of the army and the nation from him and raised that spirit to its ultimate height which produced  the Revolution but he opposed the accession of William and Mary Isabella desirous of conciliating the Bishop of Toledo to her interest set out herself to make him a visit at Alcala He sent her word that  if she entered the town at one gate he would go out at the other  Univ Hist v p    When Queen Mary on her arrival in England sent to Archbishop Sancroft to request his blessing his answer was that "she should ask her father's first  Dalrymple p  "  SUCH were the corresponding situations of persons and circum∣stances in the two kingdoms in these periods in the first of which Ferdinand became King in Castile during the life of Isabella they ruled with one title and one power their names appeared alike to all acts they received or dispatched Ambassadors raised armies and conducted their wars with the same authority  Guicciardmi Venet p a  Ferdinand was therefore only joined in the administration and title with Isabella the former was exclusively vested in William At the death of Mary William would therefore have had some advantages in an attempt to retain his administration if it had been made terminable with her life which Ferdinand did not possess He was loth to retire to his kingdom of Arragon small in comparison of that of Castile and where the royal power was extremely more limited by its constitutions and customs ‡ There was the same hazard that William would with equal reluctance have descended from the Throne of Great Britain to retire into Holland where his power as Stadtholder had begun to totter  Univ Hist v p l p l  before he had acquired a Crown  IN the calamities this arrangement of power at the accession of Ferdinand and Isabella brought in the event upon Castile and all Spain and the others with which it was threatened but from which it was providentially delivered we shall see a necessity able to have induced our ancestors to continue William upon the Throne for life On the arrival of Philip the husband of Joanna daughter of Isabella and Ferdinand who succeeded to the Throne in her own right on the death of her mother Ferdinand endeavoured in vain to maintain himself in the administration which he had assumed He was deprived of it by a very sudden Revolution but had the address to stipulate for himself such terms as must have impoverished the kingdom He soon recovered it by two events equivalent to another When he was restored the strength of Government was not restored with him the long delay he affectedly made before his return the factions occasioned by the pretensions of his competitor the absence of his successor at the time of his death continued further to enfeeble it a little after which a faction of Levellers arose the commonalty attacked the Nobility and Gentry and for a while were nearly masters of the king∣doms  Ib  of Castile Valentin and Majorca They trampled under∣foot the authority of the King  and were governed by the bas  st of the people as Bodadilla a clothworker at Medina del Campo Villeria a skinner in Salamanca  This is copied by Foulis from Sandoval He afterwards continues  What prosperity could they expect from their juntas when in the great Assembly none durst speak but such as one Pinelles a clothworker was pleased to order by pointing to them with the rod of a usurped authority  History of Plots p    The object of the insur∣gents was to massacre the gentry and to plunder all parties indis∣criminately  This rebellion commenced when Charles of Spain who became Emperor of Germany under the name of Charles the Fifth came to the Throne And there is much apparent connection both in time and principle between this and an insurrection which broke out in his Imperial dominions that of the Anabaptists which desolated several parts of Germany from to in which year Munster was reduced  Some particulars relating to this insurrection of the Anabaptists are connected with the subject of this Tract and I shall give them here having omitted them in their proper place Luther wrote his book  De Libertate Christiana  On the Liberty of a Christian in In this work in a rhetorical flight which might have been very well spared he lays it down as a proposition that  a Christian man is master of everything and is subject to no one  Bayle art "Anabaptists" The utmost fault of this perhaps is that he attempts to give a false elevation to the character of Christianity by one of the  ambitiosa ernamenta  the highsounding principles of the Stoles without sufficiently limiting his meaning The insurrection in the Emperor's dominions in Spain must have excited much ferment in the spirit a of the lower order of men in Germany This facilitated the reception of the interpretation Muncer and his associates gave to this proposition of Luther When these incendiaries founded upon it the unqualified rights of the Equality of Man Luther acted against them with singular zeal The confusions raised by the Anabaptists in the Empire are entirely ascribed by the Romanists to the fermentation of the minds of the people of the  ower orders in Germany occasioned by the Reformation It is much more properly to be called a disease of the times as it broke forth first in a country where the faith of the Roman Church had not been attacked and was excited there by the preaching Friars and Monks Howell HistLewis XIII p Everything shews us the migrating nature of these princi∣ples After having made their first appearance in Spain in their second in Germany in and been subdued there in they reappeared in England in in the reign of Edward the Sixth Good seldom comes un∣mixed With the truths of the Reformation we were so unfortunate as to import some of the political fanaticism of Muncer Storch and Stubner This likewise furnishes another instance in addition to the insurrection under Wat Tyler that it is the nature of this contagion when it is brought out of one country into another to lie dormant for some years before it breaks out the eruption has always been unprovided for and unexpected Hence in all instances of this kind we see the necessity of a long continued vigilance against  in the lest section but one of the Essay mention has been made of the  commotions which broke out in England in their origin ought to have been traced back to the Continent  Notwithstanding the length this rote has run to I must make the following addition to it In the second Article of the Appendix it is observed that the insurrection under Wat Tyler in England in imitation of that of the Jacquerie in France prolonged the semibarbarism of Europe between two and three centuries And in like manner the principal cause which hindered the Reformation being universal in Christendom involved its professors in so many persecutions and caused so many religious wars appears to have been the fanaticism of Equality which disgraced it almost at its first appearance in Ger∣many "Nothing" says Guicciardini  has so much restrained its course as the discovery that the followers of this doctrine were not less hostile to the power of Princes than to the authority of the Roman Pontiff by which it has happened that many Princes have been induced by their interest to prohibit the entrance of this contagion into their kingdoms with vigilance and severity  Lib p This historian died in the spring of the year in which Calvin was established in Geneva This jealousy of which he makes mention must have arisen solely from the commotions of the Anabap∣tists in Germany as those of France the Low Countries and Scotland did not take place until about twenty years after his death  This democratic insurrection received also the  honours of consecration like many others History has preserved to us the formulary which was made use of on this occasion by a Priest of Biscay which I transcribe  My brethren I recom∣mend to you one  Pater  and one  Ave Maria  for the holy sedition and popular commotion that it may never cease  Bayle art Padilla remark E The accuracy of this formulary may be depended upon he informs us it is translated "word for word" The Bishop of Zamora also declared  their cause to be just and their pretensions holy  Ib  em C  The rebels in Valentia were  resolved to destroy all the Gentry which occasioned a hatmaker's wise in St Catherine's street in the same city seeing some gentlemen go by to shew them to her children and they asking the reason she replied Because when you come to be men you may say that you have seen gentlemen    Los Cavaileros  Cavaliers We see this term had been applied to mark out the objects of popular outrage before Foulis p from Sandoval l s Of the indiscriminate plunder we have a proof from a discourse of the Biscayan Priest mentioned above to his parishioners he altered his sentiments of the holiness of the sedi∣tion after a visit from the insurgents Brantome Bayle and Foulis have each quoted it at length from Sandoval    It con∣tinued from to  THUS the existence of Monarchy was hazarded in Spain by the jealousy of the Castilians who when they consented to place an effective sceptre in the hand of Ferdinand made the duration of his reign dependent on the life of his wife By the contests for the supreme power consequent thereupon the effective interreg∣nums and feeble disputed administrations the spirit of sedition existing at his accession ultimately became heightened into that of a turbulent democracy With a liberal policy and in effect more favourable to Monarchy our ancestors conferred the Crown on William for life Republicanism had been subdued in England  but twentyeight years before a term relatively recent and its principles so far from being on the decrease during that period had in the latter years of Charles and in the whole reign of his successor received new vigour and extension In such circum∣stances to have followed the ominous example of Castile must have been to subvert not to support the monarchical part of the Constitution  I REPEAT here what is laid down at the beginning of this arti∣cle that the Revolution was justified by a threefold necessity That of the preservation of our religion and that  of recovering the regal power and the rights of the people  Sir Joseph Jekyll    It is the measures pursued for the second purpose which are here exclu∣sively considered The necessity then existing of a Revolution to recover the rights of the people is a different subject and to be proved from different topics What I had thought necessary to say on that branch of this compound subject  P  is contained in my Defence of the Letter attributed to Mr Reeves  THE END
