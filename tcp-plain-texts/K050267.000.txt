 A BRIEF CASE OF THE DISTILLERS And of the Distilling Trade IN  ENGLAND  SHEWING How far it is the Interest of  England  to encourage the said Trade as it is so considerable an Advantage To the Landed Interest To the Trade and Navigation To the Publick Revenue and To the Employment of the Poor Humbly recommended to the Lords and Commons of  Great Britain  in the present Parliament assembled  LONDON  Printed for T WARNER at the  BlackBay  in  Paternosterrow  MDCCXXVI Price One Shilling  THE PREFACE  AS almost every thing in this criticising Age is liable to be cavil'd at and disputed so contrary to the Rules of Charity and good Humour it is the avow'd Temper or at least the Practice of the Age where any thing so disputed is liable to a double or differing Construction always to take it in the worst  To prevent this and anticipate the Cavils of those who would suggest Evil where no Evil ought to be suggested a short Preface is thought needful to  this Work tho otherwise plain enough to prepare the Reader to be at least honest and just if he should not incline to be candid and generous in his looking over the following Sheets  Here's no Apology to be made for Vice no extenuating of Crimes no Harangues for Drunkenness when at the same time the Liquors which it has been suggested are instrumental to our Immoralitys are as the Reader may think spoken favourably of  But we are stating the Case of the Distilling Business as a Commerce and of the Distillers as a Society improving that Commerce for the Good of their Country enquiring whether they are a publick Good and Encouragers of the Trade yea or no if they are the Parliament of  Great Britain  now sitting will judge whether it is meet to encourage them or not and if not  vice versa  But it seems needful to hint and this is the Reason of this Preface That the Question does not seem to lie here Whether the Spirits shall be distill'd and consum'd among us and whether the Poor shall drink them But Whether the  Dutch  shall surnish us with them and cheat and impose upon us as well publickly as privately in the grossest and most barefac'd manner or whether our own Manufacture shall supply us our own Growth be consum'd and our own People employ'd  These are indeed very short Questions and I think few Words will decide them If the first be encourag'd and Fraud and clandestine Trade be continued for want of due Regulations and proper Measures taken to prevent it I shall only say it shall not be for want of due Information But if our own Manufacture the Labour and Industry of our own People and the Consumption of our own Growth be encourag'd  as we cannot doubt they will I take the Liberty to say the DistillingTrade in  England  which is already so much improv'd and encreas'd will in a very few Years conquer all foreign Importations all the clandestine and corrupt Management of other Countries who impose upon us and even the smuggling and running of  French  Brandy itself  The same Ignorance that occasions most of the Prejudice at the Distilling Trade among us oblig'd me to enter into the Detail of the  Dutch  Operations with their Malt Spirits and the first Introduction of  Geneva  among the common People which otherwise some might pretend is useless in the Case before us But 'tis needful we should know Things in their Original and be able to see from what Fountain every Mischief flows that we may not lay the Weight where it ought not to lie  The  Dutch  were doubtless look'd upon as great Benefactors to our Commerce and who by taking off yearly so great a Quantity of our Corn were so great an Advantage to our Landed Interest our Navigation and our Poor and while the Product let it be what it will was consum'd abroad and their Geneva and other Spirits reach'd no farther than their Camps and Fleets and withal while they did not cheat us in the Drawbacks too if ever that time was they were really so  But here you will see that it is possible in the general turn of things and the Changes which matters of Trade in common with the rest of human Affairs are subject to what is a publick Good to day may be a publick Grievance to morrow and what a Law is made to encourage at one time may require a Law to prohibit and prevent at another And this is the true Case of the  Dutch  Distilling Trade as it shocks with and at  this time interferes with our own as will be seen from  p  to of this Work in which an Account of that Part is given  Time and a short Discourse swell'd also beyond expectation in other needful parts prevents entring further into these things at present but by this may be seen the great Difficultys this valuable Business of the  English  Distillery has struggled with and the great and just Arguments for its farther Encouragement All which is humbly submitted to the Wisdom and Justice of the Parliament  A BRIEF STATE OF THE CASE OF THE DISTILLERS  c  THE Distilling of Spirits is indeed an antient Art and the Distillers Company is antient having been incorporated in the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  But as the Nature of their Business is quite chang'd that they work in a new Method and from new Materials are under new Limitations and their Interest and Trade stand in a new and quite different Situation from what was the Case formerly so it may be said their very Constitution is modern and they are young in the Manufacture  But however young the Trade may be and that the Materials they work from are different from what they formerly made use of it is apparent that they are infinitely more a publick Benefit to the Nation than they were before and that the Distilling Trade considered in its present Magnitude is one of the greatest Improvements and the most to the Advantage of the Publick of any Business now carried on in  England  In former Times the Distillers like other incorporated Arts and Mysterys work'd wholly for themselves and for their own Profit now they without a  Pun  may be truly said to be  publick spirited People  for they work for the whole Body and that immediately and in a particular manner  They work for the Gentlemen or Landed Interest in consuming the Produce of their Soil and encouraging Tillage and Husbandry  They work for the Tenant and Farmer in helping them off with their Corn and particularly in finding them a Market for those Grains of the meanest Quality and which it would be difficult if not impossible for them to dispose of to Advantage any other way  They work for the Navigation of the Kingdom abundance of Shipping and other Vessels being daily and constantly and some wholly employ'd in bringing the Corn and Coal which is consum'd by the Distillers Trade up to  London  from the remotest Parts of the Kingdom  They work for the Poor many Thousands of Familys being necessarily employ'd as well in the Husbandry of the Corn they use as in the Malting it then in carrying and removing it to and from the MaltingPlaces to the Ports for shipping it to  London  or otherwise to  London  directly by Land  But above all this they work for the Publick in the extraordinary Sums of Money which they pay to the Crown as well in the Excise upon the Spirits they extract as in the Duty upon the Malt paid before it comes to their Hands and in the Tax upon Coals  To explain these Particulars a little farther tho as briefly as we can let it be consider'd  The landed Gentlemen must be sensible the Distillers work for them since the Distilling Trade in and about  London  only consumes about Quarters of Corn and that Corn necessarily employs Acres of Land for the Produce of it for this kind of Corn being generally the Product of the remote Countys where the Lands are not rich we may venture to say two Quarters upon an Acre one with another is no mean Crop and is sufficient to make a due Calculation upon  N B  The Horses employ'd in the Husbandry of Acres of Land every Year and in the Carriage of this Corn to the Malsters and the Recarriage of the Malt either to the Market or to the Port where it is to be shipp'd tho no guess can be made at their  Number yet this may with Modesty be allowed that those Cattle being very many must necessarily consume the Growth and Produce of many Thousands of Acres of Land more  Nor is it sufficient to say that if those Lands did not produce this Corn they would produce something else or that if the Distillers did not take off and consume this Corn somebody else would seeing it is evident  England  being now become what they properly call a Corn Country produces much more Corn than it can consume And if that Consumption should be lessen'd many of those Lands must lie uncultivated as it is manifest many Thousands of Acres did before It is also a receiv'd Maxim that every Quarter of Corn which is carried off and consum'd more than was consum'd before no Scarcity being occasioned at Home is so much clear Gain to the publick Stock of the Nation  If it be objected that the Liquor distill'd is consumed at Home and so is not equally beneficial to the publick Stock as what is exported 'tis answered But much of it is also exported and more would be if Encouragement were given That most of what is consumed at Home is us'd in the stead and room of French and Foreign Brandys and Spirits which are generally bought abroad with ready Money and smuggl'd on Shore to the Ruin of the fair Trader and lessening the Revenue by a constant abcminable Fraud and  which it appears no Laws yet made have been sufficient to prevent  The Tenant or Farmer is particularly work'd for being assisted by the Distilling Trade and that in several respects as the Distillers not only take off a great Quantity of their Corn but also take off those Kinds which are not marketable for other Uses As particularly When thro' long Drought the Grain appears thin and light as is often the Case or by unseasonable Rains in Harvest the Farmers cannot get their Corn well in or when by that or other Disasters and Accidents it is damaged either in the  Field  or in the  Barn  in the  Ear  or in the  Sack  in all which Cases the Farmer is put to great Difficulty to dispose of it and were it not for the DistillingTrade could do little with it but feed his Hogs which would not enable him to pay his Rent The Farmers have oftentimes Lands which not only will not bear any other Corn but that for want of Manure and Improvement which in some Places is hard to be had of thro' the Sterility and Poverty of the Soil are unable to produce either better Corn or a better and fuller Grain of the Kind and which Lands if they could not employ them thus must lie waste and untill'd but are profitably cultivated by the Vent which they find for that meaner Kind of Grain to the Distillers This is visible in the Northern and Eastern Countys and Coasts of  England  where a very great Quantity of poor and unimproveable Lands  which formerly lay waste are now plow'd and sow'd to the Advantage of the poor Tenants tho much more of the Landlord  The Encouragement given to Navigation by the DistillingTrade in  England  is visible in many Branches of it For the Corn and the Coals which they consume being a bulky and heavy Carriage and not to be easily brought far by Land the Number of Coasting Ships and Vessels of all Kinds are visibly encreas'd since the Encrease of this Trade and consequently the Number of Seamen employ'd are encreas'd the Advantage of which is so well known it needs not be enlarg'd on The CoastingNavigation also being the greatest and best Nursery of able Seamen in the whole Nation  To the Encrease of the Number of Ships and Vessels thus employ'd might be added here the Addition which that Encrease is to all the numerous Trades both Foreign and HomeTrades and to the Employment of Hands and Encrease of Business which necessarily attends the building fitting out furnishing and victualling all those Vessels But I forbear to run it out to its full Length contenting my self to represent that this Trade is a great Addition to the Marine Interest and an Encrease and Encouragement of all its Dependencys  That they work for the Poor is evident by their setting the Poor to work which indeed is the best way of working for them The Number of Hands employ'd or whose Employments are bettered and encreased by this  Trade would take up a Volume by it self to calculate and cast it up It is sufficient to say that as all Encrease of Business is an Encrease of Employment for the Poor so all Encrease of Employment for the Poor is an Encrease of the publick Stock as it enables those People to gain their Bread who were not able to do it or not so well able before And this again assists the landed Interest too in abating the heavy Rates of the ParishPoor and enabling several thousands of poor People to support themselves and Familys which must otherwise be left upon the Parishes to maintain  This runs thro' all the several Branches of Business and People thro' whose Hands the said Manufactures pass as well the Distilling Part it self as the Materials made use of for the Production as Corn and Coals and the Shipping and other Carriages already mentioned as also the vast expensive Works of the Distillers themselves the Copper and IronWork they make use of the Vessels and large Utensils and the Number of Hands employ'd and the exceeding Charge daily expended by them in all these Things  But we wave the multiplying Particulars and come to the last Article namely the great Benefit to the Publick arising by the Dutys with which this Trade is loaded and which have now for many Years encreased the Funds upon which the Publick Credit has been so long upupheld and these are considerable in three Branches  The several Excises upon the Spirits themselves laid in several Branches and at several Times and which amount in the whole to above a hundred thousand Pounds  per Annum  The Duty upon Malt which is paid by the Distillers in the Price of the Goods when they buy and which amounts to a very great Sum  The Duty upon Coals of which the Distillers consume by Calculation above twenty thousand Chaldrons a Year  The Advantages of this Trade being thus consider'd it occurs in the next Place to shew That this Trade is yet improving that it is a growing Trade and that if not discouraged by unreasonable Hardships and Impositions it is likely to encrease in an extraordinary manner And That this Encrease is likely to be obtain'd not by an Encrease of Excesses and Immoralities but by changing the Gust of the People from drinking those other Spirits and Brandys which being manufactured corrupted and adulterated abroad are not only imported as well clandestinely as otherwise to the great Injury of the Health of our People but being bought by our ready Money are a great Disadvantage to our Commerce and Injury to the Revenue  That the Distilling Trade is a still improving and growing Business and it is worth considering to what a Height and on what a just  Foundation it is likely to improve for if it be already even while it is not much above twenty Years old in its present Magnitude so advanced as has been already said as to pay so great a Revenue to the Crown and employ such a prodigious Number of Acres of Land besides Ships Cattle and Men what may it not do when by the Improvement of the Art and the granting such Regulations by which it would flourish it shall from the mere Goodness of the Goods that shall be produc'd entirely suppress the Importation of Foreign Mixtures and even of French Brandy itself the Spirit distill'd from Corn in  England  prevailing over them all by the Force of its own Merit  Nor is this Question unworthy the Consideration of the Crown it self whether the Encouraging the Distilling Trade is not really a better and more effectual way to raise a Revenue by it than loading it with new Taxes which can have no other Effect than to lessen the Consumption and bring a rising Manufacture under a Decay  It is evident that as well by the Dearness of French Brandy and the Corruption and Fraud of the Dutch Importation as by the improv'd and still advancing Goodness of the English Malt Spirit which I shall make appear is coming fairly up to be equal to the best French Brandy the great and opiniated Gust of the People to French and Foreign Brandy is already much abated and the Consumption of our own Product  gains Ground on them every Day to the great Advantage of the whole Nation  As the Consumption encreases the publick Revenue encreases of course without the Addition of new Taxes with this undeniable Difference to the Advantage of  England  namely That this way as the Revenue encreases all the forementioned Advantages will encrease The Quantity of Lands to be cultivated will encrease The Advantage to the Farmer the Employment of Cattle Ships and Men will all encrease with it▪ whereas by burdening the Trade with new Dutys it cannot be pretended the Consumption will encrese tho the Duty should on the contrary if it should decrease as is most natural the Dearness of all Goods lessening the Consumption then all those national Advantages above must decrease in proportion  As to the weak Pretences of the Malt Spirits being destructive to the Health of the People they seem only fit to be jested with as they have been and I must say I am sorry to see some Magisterial People have expos'd their Weakness in this Point so much  They have no where shew'd the World a Reason why as good and wholesom a Spirit may not be drawn from the Corn whose mere Decoction in other Preparations is allow'd to be so good as from any other Materials and if as the Learned say the Spirit only is the nutritive Part of all our Food whether Meat or Drink  there can then be no question but that a Spirit carefully extracted from the gross and humid Parts and faithfully prepared without any Adulterations or corrupt Mixtures must be as wholesom to the Body as the same Spirit unextracted and mix'd with the common Liquids by Infusion and Ebullition or as any Spirit extracted from other Principles of any kind whatsoever  As for the Excesses and Intemperances of the People and their drinking immoderate Quantitys of Malt Spirits the Distillers are not concern'd in it at all their Business is to prepare a Spirit wholesom and good If the People will destroy themselves by their own Excesses and make that Poison which is otherwise an Antidote 'tis the Magistrate's Business to help that not the Distillers 'Tis humbly conceiv'd also they would do the same with Foreign Brandy and Spirits if there was no distilling at Home in the whole Nation  It is in the next place humbly offered to the Publick to consider what a Trade and how ruinous to the Nation in several considerable Articles the Distilling Trade in  England  is now opposed to and how necessary it is to have that pernicious Commerce if possible suppress'd And this Part is the more useful because it seems very few even of our most penetrating Gentlemen are fully Masters of it  Were the Foreign Importation of Spirits confin'd only to that Species we call French which it is generally allow'd is a wholesom and well extracted Spirit yet as the French Brandys are a Product infinitely injurious to our Commerce bought from a Nation with whom we having no Treaty of Commerce cannot exchange our Manufactures but must pay for them in Specie to the evident turning the Ballance of Trade against us In this respect they are injurious to the Health of the Publick if not to the Health of particular Bodys and consequently 'tis a publick Good to discourage them and abate their Consumption  But when we come to speak of the Foreign Spirits however falsly call'd Brandys it is evident there the Case differs extremely and we are so great Sufferers in that Part as well in respect to the Health of the Body as the Prosperity of Commerce and the Frauds put upon the Crown to the great Loss of the Revenue that as it is a publick Good in our Distilling Trade that we gain upon and lessen that Trade so it must be some Service to expose the Abuses of it and let our People see how gr  sly they are impos'd upon in it both in the publick and private Interest of our Country  To set this dark Commerce in a clear Light 'tis needful to take notice by what unhappy Artifice the subtle Dutch Traders are enabled our own Weakness concurring not only to underwork us but to impose upon us and sell  us Spirits distill'd from our own Materials cheaper than we can make them at Home tho as it happens their Avarice so natural to their Climate will not suffer them to make them so good  First  then we are to suppose they have the Malt from  England  as generally they have from  Norfolk  and the Parts adjacent  The Fraud begins at the very Beginning for the  Dutch  approving to have their Malt far grown on the Floor and without dressing and skreening off the Tails as we call them the Malster lets it run in such manner that Quarter of Barley shall measure out Quarter of Malt I speak within Compass for it has been known to measure to Quarter from Now the Fraud of this lies here The Malt in the Maker's Hands being gaged in the Barley the Duty which is  s per  Quarter is paid by the Measure or Gage of the Barley wetted so the Score or Quarter pays  l  to the King  When this Barley is malted and the Malt comes to be exported the Duty of  s per  Quarter is drawn back by Debenture and then the Malt being measured anew the Quarter being encreased to draws back upon that Measure and so the Exporter receives  l  Drawback upon that which paid but  l  Duty This is so vile a Fraud and so openly practis'd that nothing is more wonderful to me than that no notice has yet been taken of  it except this that being so well known no care has been taken to put a stop to it  But it does not end here As there is a Drawback allowed for the MaltDuty upon all the exported Malt so there is a Bounty paid to the Exporter by the Crown for the encouraging the Exportation and this is  s    d per  Quarter more which being likewise paid upon the Quarter made out of encreases the Fraud  l  more So that the Crown pays back to the Exporter  l  for every Score of Barley malted and receives but  l  by which it is no wonder that the MaltTax should be deficient  Suppose then the  Dutch  pay a sham Price  per  Quarter for their Malt and thus receive double for it again it is no wonder that they can distil a Spirit from it cheaper than the Distillers in  England  who fairly pay  s per  Bushel to the Crown for all their Malt and full  d  a Gallon for the Spirits they draw from it  Nor have the  Dutch  done with us yet but let us examine it thorowly and we shall see a greater Fraud yet behind  The  Dutch  I know not by what Error on our Side are allow'd to import here foreign Brandy the Duty upon Importation being  s    d per  Gallon or thereabouts whereas the  French  Brandy pays  s    d per  Gallon This our People take up with and call it  French  Brandy and having sufficient Proof that it comes from abroad are satisfied with it as such  The  Dutch  tell us it is not  French  tho we have good Reason to believe that all the real Brandy that is in it is  French  by which we are cheated that way But that is not the Case 'tis apparent the  Dutch  mix their own Malt Spirits with this Brandy and send it to us while our People deluded with the Notion that it must be right Brandy because it comes by a foreign Permit eagerly buy it for right Brandy and give a Price accordingly  Let any one judge then under what Disadvantages we carry on this Trade with the  Dutch  and how much it is the Interest of  England  to put a Stop to it and granting it is our Interest the next thing is to consider what is the Way to do it And that is easily answer'd the only Way is to discourage the Importation of their adulterated Brandys and encourage and encrease the Distilling Trade at home by which so many Advantages accrue to the Nation and the Consequences of which would yet be greater than perhaps is expected or than is thought possible except by some Men of more Penetration than ordinary  viz  The People will by little and little be brought off from being so fond of foreign Spirits by the Difficulty of coming at them and the Badness of their Quality as we see the Taste of the Nation was effectually brought off from the  French  to  Portuguese  Wines by the Prohibitions and high Dutys of the late War  The Distillers here are apparently able to make as good as fine as clean and as wholesom a Spirit from our own Materials as any of those imported from abroad infinitely better than the  Dutch  and as they are every Day improving will very soon if they are not discourag'd be able to outdo even the  French  Brandy itself And it is apparent they produce so fine a Spirit already that a very nice Palate cannot distinguish it from  French  and had they the  Dutch  Trick of importing it from abroad they might easily sell it for  French  Brandy among the People  I foresee that as abundance of People are apt ignorantly to charge the Immoralitys and particularly the Drunkenness of the Age upon the great Encouragement of the distilling Malt Spirits so they would make that growing Evil a Reason against the just Encouragement which ought to be given to the Business of the Distillers as a Trade as if the encouraging the Distillers Business would be an encouraging of Drunkenness whereas we are speaking of it as a needful and an advantageous Commerce a Benefit to the Publick to the Poor and to the whole Nation And that would be infinitely more so if it may be encourag'd in keeping out and putting a stop to that Foreign pernicious Commerce carried on to our great Loss and Disadvantage As to the Vice of Drinking to Excess we are no way concern'd in it the Brewing Trade and the Wine Trade are liable  to the same Objections Yet I do not find it argued by any body that therefore we must have no Beer nor Wine  So hasty Showers when they from Heaven flow down  Are sent to fructify and not to drown  And in the Torrent if a Drunkard sink  'Tis not the Brook that drowns him but the Drink  But twou'd be hard because the Sinner's slain  For fear of Drowning we must have no Rain  But to clear up this Case upon which so much weak Cavilling has been made I beg leave in a kind of Historical way to enter a little into the State of National Drinking in  England  as it has been and as it now is And tho I shall be very brief I slatter myself it shall be both useful and diverting especially I answer for it that it shall come directly to the Case in hand and clear not only the Distillers and the Distilling Trade but even all the Liquors they make from the Charge of being destructive to the Morals of the People or an Encouragement to Drunkenness and Excess any otherwise than nay not so much as all strong Liquors are so to those who drink to Excess  Our Drunkenness as a National Vice takes its Epocha at the Restoration  Anno  or within a very few Years after Some run it back to  James  I Time and refer us to the Paintings on the Ceiling of the BanquetingHouse for Proof of it but I am not writing Satyres  I am upon a Search after not so much the Vice as the Materials and Manufactures upon which it is fed and by which it was supported  Joy Mirth good Cheer and good Liquor were the Solace of the common People in the Year They rejoiced that after a long Usurpation the King should enjoy his own again that after a long Series of Blood and Confusion and a Civil War in the Bowels of their Country the People should enjoy a publick Peace and Tranquillity that Trade should flourish and Plenty succeed Misery and Want These were the several Reasons of their Joy and very merry and very mad and very drunken the People were and grew more and more so every Day  As to the Materials Beer and Ale were considerable Articles they went a great way in the Work at first but were far from being sufficient Strong Waters which had not been long in Use came in play the Occasion was this In the  Dutch  Wars it had been observed That the Captains of the  Hollanders  Men of War when they were to engage with our Ships usually set a Hogshead of Brandy abroach afore the Mast and bid the Men  drink lustick  then they might  fight lustick  and our poor Seamen felt the Force of the Brandy sometimes to their cost  We were not long behind them but suddenly after the War we began to abound in strong WaterShops These were a sort of petty Distillers who made up those compound Waters  from such mixt and confus'd Trash as they could get to work from such as damag'd and eager or sour Wines Wines that had taken Salt Water in at Sea Lees and Bottoms also damag'd Sugars and Melasses Grounds of Syder and innumerable other such like For till then there was very little Distilling known in  England  but for physical Uses The Spirits they drew were foul and gross but they mixt them up with such Additions as they could get to make them palatable and so gave them in general the Name of  Cordial Waters  And thus the strongWaterShops usually made a vast Show of Glasses labell'd and written on like the  Gallypot Latin of the Apothecarys  with innumerable hard Names to set them off  Here as at a Fountain the good Wives furnish'd their little Fireside Cupboards with a needful Bottle for a cherishing Cup And hence as from wholesale Dealers all the little Chandlers Shops not in  London  and its adjacent Parts only but over great Part of  England  were furnish'd for Sale and to the personal Knowledge of the Writer hereof and of Thousands still living not the Chandlers Shops only but just as is now complain'd of the Barbers Shops  Barber Chirurgeons  they were then called were furnished with the same and sold it by Retail to the poor People who came under their Operations  And why should it be so suprising a Thing then in our Opinion that the  Geneva  which  as I shall show presently is but the same Thing returned again should be so generally received among the inferior Poor seeing would we but look thus a little way behind us it would appear that it was so with our Ancestors and our poor People are only set down where their Forefathers were before them as to the Liquors I mean As to the Difference of the Quantitys and whether they drank more to Excess than our People do now that is a Question by itself and not much to the present Case  But it is objected They did not drink such destructive Liquors then as we do now That is in short they did not drink  Geneva  for that is the Meaning of it  This Objection must be spoken to as we go along because it comes into the History I am upon for it leads me to give a brief Account of what they did drink and where they had it I have mentioned the Introduction of the strongWaterShops and petty Distillers who began this Trade I come now to the Liquors some of their Names were as follow  Aqua Vitae  Aqua Mirabilis  Aqua Solis  Aqua Dulcis  These in  Latin  Anniseed Water  Cinamon Water  Clove Water  Plague Water  Cholick Water which in short was  Geneva  These and many more in  English  But to sum up the whole  Aqua Vitae  and Anniseed Water were the Captains or Leaders and the strong Inclinations of the People run all into those two And in a little while the latter prevail'd over the former too and as Anniseed Water was the only Liquor for some Years the Quantity that was drunk of it was prodigious great In a word it was the  Geneva  of these Times it was not only sold in the Chandlers Shops and in the Barbers Shops as above and perhaps in Bulks and Stalls too but it had this particular Article attending it which we are not yet arrived to with the  Geneva    viz  That it was cried about Sreets of which the Memory of the famous  Anniseed Robin  will be a neverdying Testimony who was so well known in  LeadenHall  and the  StocksMarket  for his Liquor and his broadbrim'dHat that it became proverbial when we saw a Man's Hat hanging about his Ears to say  he looks like Anniseed Robin  This Part  viz  of going about the Streets and into the Fields to Shows and Musters of the Trained Bands to cry a  Dram of the Bottle  has not been so long omitted but that we can all remember it And the Bumboats who continue to this Day crying a  Dream of the Bottle  in the River among the Ships are a Remainder of that Custom and which was never left off atall  I should not however have troubled you with these Instances from  Low Life  but that it is in the Scene we are now acting and this  Anniseed Robin  was a magnipotent Fellow in his Day I assure you  Having thus brought you back to the Dramdrinking Age I must let you see how a full Stop was put to it on a sudden and what became of the drinking World in the mean time  As all these various sorts of good Liquor had their Meridian so they had too their Declination and after some time they fell into a general Dislike For the French outdid them exceedingly and pouring in their Liquors at a very cheap rate and the Goodness of the Brandy recommending it self also the famous  Anniseed Water  began to lose Ground and the People took their Drams in plain Brandy the Physicians also on all Occasions telling the People it was better than any of their compounded Waters  Thus the best Brandy being sold for  d per  Quartern the Poor could have a large Dram for a Halfpenny and the Fellows that cry'd it about the Streets carry'd with them little double DramCups which being held up on one side was a Penny and on the other side a Halfpenny  This held on for several Years and the Customhouse Books will shew the prodigious Consumption till the late Revolution when a furious and continu'd War the  France  breaking out a Prohibition of Trade follow'd Brandy rose from  d  to  d per  Quartern and from thence to a Scarcity so that none good was be had The Distillers not being yet come into  the way of Distilling from Malt could not supply them and thus the Poor were thrown off from the DramCup to the AlehousePot to their great Regret as well as Expence For now they could call for nothing less than a Pint which tho for a while it was but a Penny yet soon after by doubling the Excise came up to three Halfpence where it still stays And thus I have gone thro' the first Part of my History  It remains a Question which I believe is not yet determin'd tho I see not much Difficulty in it Whether the Morals of the People were the better or the worse by this Change If I may use so much Freedom I insist that they are much the worse And as my Reasons for it are of some weight in the present Debate I beg you will hear them summ'd up as briefly for your Convenience as I can  The Charge was immediately increas'd and a poor Man that could before be refresh'd in his Labour at the small Expence of a Halfpenny was now oblig'd to spend three Halfpence at a time as often as either Necessity or Inclination call'd him  The Expence of Time was immediately also encreas'd for then poor Men in their Stails or Garrets or Shops or wherever they were at their work could call in and call up poor  Anniseed Robin  or any of his Contemporarys or Successors and take a Dram without the least Loss of their Time and go on with their  Work Or if they were at DayLabour in the Field or the Street in the Wet and the Cold they could call for a Dram for a Penny or a HalfPenny as their Pockets could afford and go on with their Business whereas upon this Change the Poor were really distress'd and they made loud Complaints of it as I very well remember  Having thus gone thro' the History of what's past and given you some Account of the manner of our Drinking till within these few Years allow me to bring it on to our own Times and view our Poor in the present Situation of their great Affair I mean of Liquor for what they shall drink is I assure you no matter of mean Concern to them  The Poor as above having been reduc'd to the miserable Necessity of this AlehouseTippling and grown sick of the tedious and dull as well as expensive way of Drinking were apparently ripe for a Change if they could have found any way to their Advantage when on a sudden the diligent  Dutch  fruitful  at Invention  as the  English  are at  Imitation  and with their own Advantage at the bottom you may be sure help'd them out again  as they had done once before  for the  Dutch  Sutlers carry'd into the Camps in  Flanders  during the late long Wars against  France  a certain new distill'd Water call'd  Geneva  being a good wholesom Malt Spirit if rightly prepar'd wrought up with JuniperBerries a Thing not only wholesom but really physical and for  many Years allow'd to be so by the most celebrated Physicians  It was strange to observe how this Liquor prevail'd in the Army how the Soldiers were surprized at the Goodness of it the Spirit the Vigor it put into them They declar'd publickly to one another there never was any such Liquor heard of in the World it put a perfectly new Spirit and new Life into them and invigorated them at such a rate that it made them quite a new kind of People  At first like the Champaign and Burgundy it was drank among the Gentlemen only a Drink for Generals and for Officers Nay they tell us in  Holland  that even the great D  of  M  gave it a Character as a Thing that inspir'd Nature with a new Flame and put a sort of Vigor into the Mind which Nature itself was a Stranger to before and that he recommended the moderate Use of it to the greatest Men when they were going at any time to engage the Enemy  It is a great Mistake to argue from hence that the  Dutch  always made their Soldiers mad with Drink before they led them out to fight for what I am saying of them now is of the Generals and Officers before the Soldiers came to have any fellowfeeling of this Article  At first no doubt the  Dutch  made a fine Spirit of it and as perfect as it was possible to be expected But as the  Dutch  are hardly to be charged with any Deficiency in needful  Craft and that they saw plainly what was good for the High was also good for the Low and that the poor Soldiers Money was as good to them as the great Generals if they could but make it out in Quantity they soon came into the old Trading Maxim  viz  that Cheapness causes Consumption and found out a Way to make a Sort of the same Spirit and drawn perhaps from the same Ingredients that being made meaner in Quality should be proportioned to the Purse as well as to the Palate of the common Soldiers  And thus the Soldiers in the Confederate Camp came to the honour of Drinking upon a Level with their Officers or at least flattering themselves that they did so which indeed was almost the same Thing and if there was any apparent Difference it was such that neither Officers or Soldiers were nice enough in their Palates to judge of  It would interrupt our Business and the main Design of this Work to dwell too long upon the particular Steps and Gradations by which  Geneva  gain'd so much upon the Minds of the common People or to enquire into the Reasons of it If what I have said  viz  its being thus approved by their general Officers gave the first Occasion it is sufficient to tell you that by this means the  Geneva  gain'd a vast Credit among the  Dutch  Troops from the  Dutch  it spread universally among all the Confederate Armys and the  English  Soldiers became as great Admirers of it as any other Nation whatsoever except the mere  Dutch  themselves for they indeed drank it like MothersMilk  But you are to take notice here that the subtle Distillers and particularly the wise Merchants of  Amsterdam  who had felt the Sweet of the Trade had consulted together to bring this Part to sute with their Interest also namely That the  Geneva  which they sent to the Army for the Use of the Officers and Gentlemen especially General Officers bore a different Price from that which was open'd for the ordinary use of the Army and for the common Soldiers Whether it differ'd in Virtue and Value or not I cannot enter into here for in such Liquors as these I shall not answer for it that what is sold for the highest Price is always of best Quality in proportion sometimes Fancy grounded upon an advanc'd Demand answers to Goodness and makes an Equivalent to the Quality of the Liquor nor could those litle needful Frauds be always carried on without it but of that by itself  Let this Part be one way or other and be the Liquor better or worse this is certain the Price was reduc'd in the common SuttlersCarriages and the poor Soldiers had their  Gin  at a Rate fit for a poor Soldier to pay And this too betray'd a Secret in the  Dutch  Commerce which it has been proper to mention already and for the sake of which this Part has been mention'd here and is absolutely necessary to speak of namely That the  Dutch  were enabled  to bring down the Price of their  Geneva  even without reducing the Goodness  I must be allow'd to say that it seems exceeding hard that as our Distillers were not then come into the Thing and that  Geneva  was not known here they should find themselves so oppressed at their first Entrance and the  Dutch  should be able not only to make their own Spirits  Cent per Cent  cheapter than we could but that they shall be still able to import them upon us fifty  per Cent  cheaper than we can make them and yet raise them from the same Materials namely from our own Corn  And here there is such an allow'd Concession made by the whole Legislature of  Great Britain  to one of the Articles summ'd up in the first Part of this Work namely of the vast Advantage the consuming of Corn is to the Landed Interest that I could not but remind the Reader of it namely The allowing back all the Duty upon Malt and  s    d  BountyMoney upon the exporting it as Barley which if the Sums drawn back by Certificate in the Countries of  Norfolk  and  Kent  only are cast up will appear surprising in Value I say it is a full Concession to our Argument and nothing but a full Conviction that the exporting it is infinitely advantageous to  GreatBritain  can be a justifiable Reason for it  Were the Commons of  GreatBritain  to have been told when that Law was made that all or the greatest Part of the Bounty whatever Sums were drawn from the Publick by it would  only have two Effects and both of them pernicious to the British Commerce in general and to the Revenue in particular it is my Opinion they would have consider'd better of it before they had pass'd it into a Law or have put it in the Power of a voracious Set of Men to have ruin'd so great and rising a Manufacture and Branch of our Commerce at our own Expence  Were those Bountys taken off for a while or were they reduc'd a little to a tolerable Degree the Consequence would presently be this That the  Dutch  could no more draw a Spirit  per Cent  cheaper from our own Materials than we could or import it upon us mixt among  French  or other Foreign Brandys so much to our Disadvantage  What Reason can be alledged why the  Dutch  should be able to extract a better Spirit from the fame Goods Nay it is evident they do not and we are assur'd they cannot but they have gotten into a Course of uncontrolled K  ry and by this they can send it over cheaper and that is sufficient to all the rest for Cheapness causes Consumption  But to return to the Article above When first the  Dutch  came into this Trade as I hinted before  p  they took their Malt so rough so grown and so undress'd that it was frequent for a Score of  English  Barley at that time to hold out to quarters of Malt at the Exportation which accordingly magnified the Fraud and entitled the Exporter to receive back twelve Pound for a Score of Barley  which upon being gaug'd in the Cistern paid to the Crown but  l  Duty and so again in the Bounty But they have been pleas'd to be a little less barefac'd since and have thanks to their Modesty reduc'd it by a slight Dressing as above to forty Quarters for twenty  N B  There is a little Cavil which may be rais'd here and we doubt not our Opposers will think they have some Advantage in it namely That the Barley does generally swell one in the Score before the gauging but we may answer that by itself  To what Extremes do we see wise Men run upon wrong Information of Things and yet how little Care do they take to be rightly and better inform'd of the Things they are mistaken about It will perhaps be very hard to persuade Men of common Sense to believe that the  Dutch  can import their Spirits extracted from our Materials  per Cent  cheaper than we can make them and yet at the same time prove too that all the ordinary Parts of the Workmanship about them may be performed as cheap in  London  as in  Amsterdam  But it must be confessed that when they come to be more fully and rightly inform'd of things and to see what a Cheat is put upon the  English  Crown in the Conditions upon which they get their Corn which are the Materials the Riddle is expounded presently and we cannot suppose Men to have common Sense who will not then open their Eyes to it  But to come back to theCamp Our soldiers tasting this Liquor brought the Desire as well as the Fame of it over with them  at the ensuing Peace  and our Distillers preparing it as well here as the  Dutch  abroad they supply'd the People with it wrought from our own Corn the Product of our own Land very much to our Advantage as has been said already the Encrease of the Demand afterwards encreassing the Consumption of our own Malt to a very great degree  It seems  Bacchus  and the  Brewer  take Umbrage at this Invasion and tho what between the  WineBrewer  and the  BeerBrewer  they have had the poisoning Trade to themselves to long that one would think they should be satiated with the Mischiefs of it tho they were not with the Profits yet it seems they do not sit easy under it tho I am told the Pretence of the Brewing Trade being declined on this Account is but a Pretence and no more It seems they could have been content with it in the Apothecarys Shops and allow'd it among the  Materia Medica  to pass for good Physick but when they found it applied to the defeat of  Tippling  and  Sotting  as above they resolv'd against it as fatal and destructive to the Health and Understanding and that as to the Tempers of the People it was safer to be drunk with any thing rather than  Geneva  It is a poor Foundation to raise Clamour upon  viz  To single out the vicious Temper of the Poor to exclaim against when here is a Vice in our Trade that wants reforming first and which if an End were put to it would both do the Crown and the Revenue Justice It would block up the Door to any more  Dutch  Cheats of this kind at least and put it into our own Power to reform the rest with more ease and till then I doubt it will never be reformed while we live  It has been suggested by some how weakly we shall see presently that burdening the Distilling Trade in  England  with new Dutys will be a Means to cure all the Evils which they acknowledge seem to be growing upon us by the immoderate Use or drinking of the Malt Spirits among the Poor If these Mens Zeal for the Reformation of the People was no greater than their Knowledge of the true Interest of their Country they would never propose a Method which should only shut the Door against the drinking our own Manufacture our Spirits distill'd at home and open the Door to a Flux or Tide of the same or worse Spirits imported from  Holland  and so bring in  Dutch  Drunkenness among us too which by the way is yet something of a worse kind than our own feeding the Intemperance of the People with the same or worse Ingredients but giving the  Dutch  the Profit of it and leaving us nothing but the Poverty and the Crime  Had not this preposterous Notion started itself into the World just when these Sheets were in the Press and so fair an Opportunity was left to answer and expose it this Tract had not swell'd to such a bulk but since the Politicks of these Gentlemen have taken such a Turn and this Flight of their Wit has carried them to such a height I must trespass a little on the Patience of the Gentlemen that shall see these Sheets to give in a Word or two upon so weighty a Suggestion  All wise Crowns and ours of  England  in particular make it a Maxim in their laying Dutys  never by loading their own Product  to encourage Importations from abroad in prejudice of the same Goods manufactur'd at Home But if it shall be prov'd  That burthening the  English  Distillery will only serve to encrease the Advantage of Foreigners and ruin the Manufacture of Spirits distill'd from our own Corn at Home how will it answer the wise Maxims of State and of Trade which we all depend so much upon  If it shall appear that such a burthening the Manufacture at Home will but encrease the Frauds of Foreigners and instead of detecting the vilest clandestine Commerce in  England  and the opennest and grossest Abuse of Parliamentary Bounty with a lessening to the publick Good which it was appointed to encrease wherre then will the good End of the Parliament be answered and how well are such People qualified for Politicians  And if after all it should further appear that the Proposal itself comes from a Quarter where no such sanative Principles as these of preserving our Trade are to be found but that it is all from a View to separate and corrupt Ends tending in themselves to support the Interest of a Set of Men who carry on a Trade a thousand times more pernicious to Trade and to the Morals of the People than this I say if this should be prov'd by it all then it must give a new Turn to our Conceptions about these Things themselves we must run 'em all over again in our Thoughts  Let us then endeavour to state the Case clearly among us  That the  Dutch  do cheat and impose upon us already most grosly and barefacedly or rather to put it right the Exporters of the Malt to  Holland  do cheat and impose upon us for if the  Dutch  are not the Men let us not wrong the Devil but lay the Saddle on the right Horse  That by this Cheat let who will be in it the  Dutch  Distillers for we are not talking of the  Dutch  as a Nation but as Traders and especially as Distillers are enabled to buy their Malt for less than half the Price which our  English  Distillers give for it  That by this means they are likewise enabled to work their Spirits whether the  Geneva  or other Spirits for we are not now speaking of one sort more than another so cheap as to sell them one time with another for at least  per Cent  less Price than our Distillers can work them for from the same Materials  That by the Advantages Disguises and various Kinds of crafty Ways which the  Dutch  have for disposing and dispersing these Spirits among our People under the Names of Foreign Brandys and by the Aid of Foreign Permits for they always find the way to make us the Tools of our own Delusions they have an Opportunity to sell that  per Cent  dearer than we do which they can make  per Cent  cheaper  Let any considering Person take these Things in pieces a little and examine them separately  All Errors and Mistakes of Mankind are much better and easier prevented in Principle than corrected in Practice as Fire is easier suppress'd in the Sparks than in the Flame The first and grossest of all the Mischiefs that can be complain'd of in the Distilling Trade are founded in this Original Fraud of putting  l  of the CrownMoney in the Pocket of the Exporters for every Score of Barley which is malted for their Exportation whether to  Holland  or any other Part and for which they pay  l  Duty and no more or very little more as has been said  Let us first see the Magnitude of this Cheat and then a little of the Consequence of it Suppose the  Dutch  take off an hundred thousand Quarters of Malt a Year for their Distillery if I undercalculate it the Gentlemen can make an Allowance for that upon all their own  Estimations and I doubt not but I speak much below the Quantity But I say suppose the  Dutch  take off for the Use of their Distilling Trade one hundred thousand Quarters of Malt from  England  every Year     l  s  d  This ought by the Malt Debentures to draw back after the rate of  s  Sterling  per  Quarter which is in the whole        And for the Bounty allow'd by Act of Parliament on the Exportation of it as Corn it ought to receive also  s    d per  Quarter more which is upon the whole        Total        This Encouragement were there nothing more in it is very considerable and gives the  Dutch  a vast Advantage over our Distillers here at home who pay this whole Duty without any Drawback Bounty or other Encouragement whatsoever except it be that they also pay a heavy Duty upon the Spirits again after they are distill'd instead of which the  Dutch  sending their Spirits hither by the help of another Fraud subsequent to all the rest have a Price for theirs superior to ours and pay no Duty at all and whatever Duty is paid we pay it our selves as we are the last Consumers  But after we have considered the heavy Weight of  l  upon every hundred thousand Quarter of Malt which the  Dutch  take off and the Disadvantages which our Distillers lie under upon this account let us add to it what is mentioned  p  and undeniably made out namely That the  Dutch  or somebody for them draw off from us just two and thirty Thousand five hundred Pounds Sterling more upon every hundred Thousand Quarter of Malt they take off and which is done by the mere Craft and Fraud of the Exporter as has been said which our Offices are so supinely negligent in as to pass upon themselves for Law or our Officers so well interested in as to connive at I do not pretend to enquire whether it is Ignorance or Corruption let the Gentlemen concern'd acquit themselves of it as well as they can it is equal to the poor discourag'd Distillers whether they are oppress'd by one or the other 'tis manifest they are oppress'd by it be it which way it will 'tis the same thing if my House be fir'd whether it were done by a  FoolServant  or a  RogueServant  the House is burnt and I feel the Loss let it be done how it will  Not but that it may come in my way in this Debate to say something of the probable Causes or at least the Encouragements of these gross pieces of Fraud and how a wise Nation as we are esteem'd to be or at least think our selves to be should come to shut our Eyes so  apparently to our own Interest as to lie open to such Cheats as these are and to be so abus'd every Day nay not to shut our Eyes to them but to be abus'd with our Eyes open for certainly this can never be said to be a Secret if it has been practis'd so long and never seen before we must have been as unhappy in the Ignorance as I think we are expos'd in the Fraud of it  But to return to the Point about loading the Distillers Trade with farther Weight I would humbly recommend to those Gentlemen who have this Design under Consideration if any are so weak that they would first consider of unloading it and then they may put it into a Condition to bear any Hardships they shall afterwards put upon it with the greater Ease  Let them unload it from the dead Weight which these clandestine Practices are not to the Trade only but to the whole Nation for in short 'tis a Tax levied upon us to give to a set of clandestine Traders whether they are  Dutchmen  or  Englishmen  or any Men where the Malt is ship'd for  Holland  'tis the same thing 'tis a National Grievance and a Burden upon the Trade which ought to be removed  All Inequality of Burthens is a Prejudice to the fair Trader in the Sense of which Maxim it has always been the Care of our Crown by an Equality of Burthens to give the fair Trader a due Advantage Hence smuggling  and clandestine Trade is on so many Accounts guarded against and by so many Laws made criminal among us tho so impossible to be fully prevented  But here is a Law which however good in it self and intended with the same just View is unhappily and by the Craft of a set of Foreigners perverted the Point of it turn'd upon the fair Traders and the greatest clandestine Fraud that ever was of its kind practised in  England  is set up by its Authority So that the Cheat is supported by the very Law that was made to prevent it may it is founded upon the very Execution of that Law of Equality on which Justice was to have been expected  Instead of an encouraging Drawback by which the Consumption of our Growth was supposed to be secur'd and in order to which the Exporter to have the Benefit of all the Duty that was paid being return'd to him he receives  l per  Score in one Article more than ever was paid and  l    s  in another more than ever was intended  I have often heard it spoken of with some wonder in  England  how it came to pass that in some particular Places on the Coasts the Drawback upon the Duty on Malt came to more than the Duty it self as was alledg'd once likewise in the Affair of the  SaltDuty  and by which as I have been told a gross Abuse of the Publick afterwards was detected Whether it was so in the Salt or no and how  it came about is none of my Business But if it be so likewise in the Malt Drawback I believe upon a due Enquiry into the Reason of it some of these wicked Things might come to light and perhaps more than some People are aware of  But to reduce all this to the true End for which all such Complaints ought to be made namely the preventing the like and supposing it to be detected and prevented as we hope it may what are we to enquire next  The next Question is How would this reform the Abuses of the Distilling My Answer is direct in two Heads  You would then have no Abuses to correct but our own whereas now all the Corruptions and Adulterations of Foreigners are put to our homeAccount  The Distillers then being as is said again secur'd and form'd into a Body with due Powers to act by and sufficient Encouragement are able to answer for all Abuses of the Trade that is they are able to answer that there should be no Abuses committed no unwholesom Liquors distilled or sold if they were distill'd  This being the Case there would be nothing left for the Crown to be concern'd in but to prevent if they can the Intemperance of the People  Nor would such a Regulation want its Encouragement even in the Nature of the thing there are many Ways to encrease the Revenue  besides loading Trade with new Taxes If this particular Branch clogg'd with Difficulties and oppress'd by Foreigners Smuglers and the like may be set free from those Oppressions and Weights giving it room to encrease encreases the Revenue of course whereas while it sinks under those Weights adding Dutys only serves to sink it deeper and so even lessens the Revenue which it paid before  This was the Case exactly with the late high Dutys upon Pepper while those Dutys subsisted the Revenue was devour'd I think I may say wholly devour'd by the Drawbacks and all the HomeConsumption of Pepper was supply'd by clandestine Trade that is to say by Smuglers whereas those high Duties being again taken off the Trade return'd into its own Channel and the Revenue reviv'd which was sunk before  Thus if the Distilling Trade should be loaded with more Duties while these Frauds on the Foreign Trade still remain unredress'd what must be the Case but this namely The Foreigners would have all the Business and the Distillers might put out their Fires and sit still  But I meet with another popular Objection still and it shews a little from what Quarter all the rest has come The Objection is this  That the Distillers pay too small an Excise that they may pay a little higher Duty very well and that they do not pay an Equality with the Brewer upon a Quarter of Malt  Now tho this seems a little envious at best supposing we should grant the Suggestion as if the Brewer was uneasy that any Malt should be consum'd but what should pay as great a Duty as that which their own Trade pay yet as it happens not to be so in fact it exposes the Objector so much the more and leaves us to guess a little the plainer whence these Clamours at the Distillers had at least some of their Original I shall enquire into the Particulars presently but shall name another Objection of something a like nature along with it  It is also said there is a sudden and great Decay of the Brewing Trade in  London  and this too they would place to the account of the Distilling Trade as if the Distillers were rising upon the Fall of the Brewers all which are mere groundless Jingles of a few designing Men who would deserve more regard if they spoke truth and as they are mistaken deserve indeed little or none at all  It is true we have not room here to give a large and particular Answer to all these Cavils for such we hope to prove them to be and no more But yet we cannot close this Tract without letting them know that we have heard all they have to say upon these material Heads which upon the whole amounts to but very little in Substance tho much perhaps in Noise and Pretences The whole may be briefly answer'd in the following Particulars reserving a more full and particular  Answer as we may hereafter see occasion But to take them as they lie  It is so far from being true that the Distillers pay less Duty upon a Quarter of Malt than the Brewer that 'tis evident they pay  more  And not to enter at this time into a Calculation of the Particulars here not being room for it this we may undertake to assert namely That the Distillers pay near  s per  Quarter upon the Malt they use allowing a just proportion for its being not drest down to the same Fineness and consequently the same Measure as that of the Brewers  Whereas on the contrary the Brewers the Dressing of their Malt being likewise consider'd do not pay above  s  to  s    d  on each Quarter  For let it be considered here what is observ'd already in its place and ought to have notice taken of it on all occasions namely that for the DoubleBeer PaleAles Stout and such like Drinks which the Brewers now run so much upon and in which they do not draw near so great a length from a Quarter as in the ordinary Brewing they of course do not pay so much to the Crown for the Excise nay for these Liquors they may be said not to pay six Shillings  per  Quarter on the Malt whereas the Distillers always extracting the utmost Spirit the Malt will put forth and paying as much Duty for the meanest Malt as the Brewer does for the best has an infinite  Disadvantage and pays more for his Malt by how much the less Spirit he extracts from it  This as above will require a more full Explanation and on occasion such an Explanation will not be wanting but in the mean time those who make the Objection know so much of the Truth of it that they are able to save us the Labour and answer themselves tho at this time perhaps such generous Treatment may not be for their Interest  I go back then to the first Head namely That there is a great and sudden Decay of the Brewing Trade My Answer is  There has been no apparent Decay of the Brewing Trade one Year with another for above four Years past to last  Midsummer  what Decay has been must be since that time  By consequence then the great encrease of the Consumption of Spirits in  England  has not been the Cause of the Decay of the said Brewing for as that Encrease has been of three or four Years continuance why if it decay'd the Brewing Trade was it never felt till since  Midsummer  last  There has been no proportion'd Advance upon the Distillery since  Midsummer  last why then should the Decay of one be occasion'd by the other which has not felt the Effect of it If the Distilling had encreas'd in proportion during that time and that so much more than ever it had done before then indeed the Water of one Channel being found in the  Stream of another would account for the difference But as that is not so in fact the Deficiency must be from some other more apparent Cause and that we shall see presently  The apparent Causes of the Decay or sudden stop of the Brewing so far as the Fact may be granted for it is not so mighty in Fact as in Noise are these  The excessive Dearness of Hops the last Season which was so heavy a RentCharge upon the Brewer that it really put a check to their whole Business and some of them found it hard to furnish themselves with a suitable Stock upon any Terms whatever That Difficulty has of course caused them to lessen the Quantity of Beer among their Customers as much as they could when they came to lay in their Stores  The Dearness of Malt it self which by the universal Badness of the Season in all the Malting Counties has had an effect upon the Malt as well as upon other Grain this has both lessen'd the Quantity and advanc'd the Price so that Malt in particular has been to  s per  Quarter dearer this Year than it was the last These things have been so apparent and here so well known to other People as well as to the Brewers themselves that 'tis something strange they should lay themselves open to so effectual a Reply  But this too will appear less strange when we shall add that the K  ery of the Brewers themselves to say no worse of it may have  some share in the Reasons for a sudden Decay of their Trade especially if it be true that they have come into that barefac'd piece of Policy  viz  To strike their Work in order to lessen the Excise and so make a joint Clamour for promoting the Design But of this we may say more in its proper Place  But now to put in a Word for the Poor as well as for the Trade and so to close this Discourse you must allow me to say that were it so that they had quite forsaken the drinking Beer and Ale and were wholly come into the drinking of Spirits Brandy Geneva or what you please it seems to me they have done not only that which their Ancestors did before them but even what their Superiors have seem'd to lead them into just now by a general Example As follows  There has been for some Years and still continues among us a national Gust or Inclination to drinking stronger and highe pric'd Liquors than formerly I do not say we drink more or more to Excess that is a Subject of another Nature and however true is not to my present Purpose But the Stream of the Nation's Palate runs I say for stronger and dearer Liquors Let me begin at the Head  The  Ladys  and  Gentlemen  of Quality and Distinction not content with the usual and as I have said above most wholesom Dram call'd right  French  Brandy now treat with  Ratafia  and  Citron  at a Guinea a Bottle  The  Punch Drinkers  of Quality if any such there be not contented with the best  French  Brandy in their Bowls must have  Arrack  at  s  to  s per  Gallon  The  Wine Drinkers  of the better sort not content with the  Portugal  and  Barcelona  Wines must have high Country  Morgeau O Brian  and  Hermitage  Clarets at  s  to  per  Bottle and after that  Champagn  and  Burgundy  at  s  to  s per  Bottle  The common  Draft  of Red Wine of  Oporto  and  Viana  tho all stronger than the  French  Wines formerly drank is not now strong enough for the  Citizens  but they must be  made up  so the WineBrewers call it with  Lisbons  with  Alicants  and  BeneCarloes  and the  Oporto  and  Lisbon  Whites tho very strong are turn'd out of Doors for the yet stronger  Mountain Malaga  To descend still lower Our common Drinkers of  Ale  or  Beer  are not contented as formerly with the ordinary  Beer  and  Beer  or Porters  Ale  but they are advanced first to  Twopenny  then to  doubleBeer  and  Stout  and now to the strongest NorthCountry  Burton  and  Tamworth Pale Ale Dorchester  and  Newbury Beers  and the like of which great Quantitys are brought up by Land Carriage above Miles and for which above smallBrewhouses have as I am told been erected within these few Years in the City and the adjacent Parts which Ales are sold from  d  to  d per  Quart  In like manner then the Poor following this unhappy Humour of the Rich and finding themselves as willing to gratify their Palate only not equally able to bear the Expence are fallen into the old Dramdrinking Way which their Fathers practis'd before them and which as it is easy to their Pockets spends less of their Time and unless they please no more prompts their Excesses than the  Beer  and the  Ale  did before and if I may give my Opinion I think indeed not so much And thus I have brought down the History to our present Times  I shall close this Tract which is already swell'd to a larger Bulk than was intended with a few very short Hints at the Disadvantage which the Distillers at present are under in the Course of their Trade and which they hope to be deliver'd from by the Justice of the Parliament and the Encouragements which they have reason to hope for and expect  Some of the Disadvantages they are under are as follows  That whereas all the Malt exported to  Holland  and from which the  Dutch  extract the Spirits which they import upon us draws back the whole Duty besides a Bounty of  s    d per  Quarter to the Exporter not to speak of the Fraud mentioned above and which doubles both the Drawback and the Bounty yet our own distill'd Spirit upon Exportation draws back but  l    s per  Tun of  the Excise paid and nothing at all of the Malt Duty  Thus the  Dutch  are enabled exceedingly to underwork and undersell the  English  Distiller even by our selves and at the Expence of our own Crown whom they so many ways injure in the said Allowances  That by the Advantages given to the  Dutch  for the importing Brandy  s    d per  Gallon Duty less than the  French  which Dutys are also paid by the Importers not by the  Dutch  they have an unrestrain'd Liberty of imposing their Mixtures upon us of a baser Kind which Mixtures because they apparently come from abroad and are called Brandy at the Customhouse our People are easily persuaded to take for true Brandy whereas it is very well known that many times it is inferior to our common Malt Spirits and our Distillers affirm they are able to outdo even the best of it  The  Dutch  by the like Artifice come into our Rivers and Ports or at least into the open Roads where our Ships ride as in  Yarmouth  Roads the  Downs St Helens  and even into the River of  Thames  up to the  Nore  and the  Hope  and there supply our outwardbound Ships with their Spirits or Brandys as they call them not only for the said Ship's use but also in Quantities for Trade for all which no Entry is made or any Duty at all paid So that our  Guinea  and  EastIndia  Ships in particular which used to take  in large Quantities of Liquors of our Distillers go away now with little or no Stores depending to be supply'd by the  Dutch  in the  Downs  and other Places  These are all great Obstructions to the Distilling Trade and as they are withal great Abuses upon the fair Traders in general and injurious to the Crown in particular we cannot doubt but if fairly represented the Distillers shall have such Relief as in right and justice they ought to expect  Besides these apparent Discouragements in favour of Foreigners and in favour of clandestine Trade they are unjustly attack'd with Clamours and popular Pretences as if their Trade was a publick Nusance and ought to be regulated by the Magistrates suggesting that their Liquors are unwholesom and destructive Incentives to Vice and tempting to the Poor to the Waste of their Health Money Time and Understandings Things which tho not worth replying to their apparent Partiality being sufficiently already exposed and as all the Excesses of the People either in these Liquors or any other are founded in their own Intemperance the Distillers say if they may obtain such Powers and just Authority which as a Company they once had and still ought to have and which other Companys in Cases less essential to the Health of the People now have so as they may be able to inspect and regulate the Trade as it ought to be regulated they would answer to the World for the Wholesomness  of the Liquors they extract and appeal to the Understanding and Sense of the most experienc'd Physicians if unprejudic'd  As for the learned and worthy Physician who if Report lyes not is to be employ'd to show to the World the pernicious Consequence of drinking  Geneva  or Malt Spirits and how many Thousands it has slain we impatiently wait his elaborate Performance and to help it forward only beg he will not omit to prove also the few needful Particulars following  That the Malt Spirits made in  England  are much more pernicious than those made in  Holland  and sent over hither tho made all from the same Materials  That the Liquor call'd  Geneva  is mortal in it self and that the JuniperBerries put into it are Poison  That it is the Liquor it self not the immoderate Use or Excess of it that does the Mischief  That 'tis much better to be drunk with StrongBeer and PaleAles brew'd from Malt than with Spirits extracted from the same Malt tho it is the Spirit alone in the Beer and Ale that intoxicates  That Drunkenness by Ale and Beer destroys no Health wastes no Time spends no Money weakens no Understandings and that it is only the  Geneva  that does such wicked Things as those  That there are more People drunk with  Geneva  than with Ale and Beer and that a poor Man can be drunk for a Halfpenny  And lastly to clench it all Let him prove that more People die of drinking  Geneva  than die of the  Doctor  not failing to tell to the World where that formidable  Geneva  Shop stands that has slain more Christians than himself  FINISH
