 AN EPISTLE TO The RIGHT HONOURABLE Sir  ROBERT WALPOLE  Quae censet Amiculus ut si  Caecus Iter monstrare velit  Hor  LONDON  Printed for J WALTHOE overagainst the  RoyalExchange  in  Cornhill  Price  d  AN EPISTLE To the Right Honourable Sir  ROBERT WALPOLE  THO' Strength of Genius by Experience taught  Gives Thee to found the Depths of human Thought  To trace the various Workings of the Mind  And rule the secret Springs that rule Mankind  Rare Gifts yet WALPOLE wilt thou condescend  To listen if thy unexperienc'd Friend  Can ought of Use impart tho' void of Skill  And win Attention by sincere good Will  For Friendship sometimes Want of Parts supplies  The Heart may furnish what the Head denies  As when the rapid  Rhone  o'er swelling Tides  To grace old  Ocean  's Court in Triumph rides  Tho' rich his Source he drains a thousand Springs  Nor scorns the Tribute each small Riv'let brings  So thou shalt hence absorb each feeble Ray  Each Dawn of Meaning in thy brighter Day  Shalt like or where thou can'st not like excuse  Since no mean Interest shall prophane the Muse  No Malice wrapp'd in Truth's Disguise offend  Nor Flattery taint the Freedom of the Friend  When first a generous Mind surveys the Great  And views the Crowds that on their Fortune wait  Pleas'd with the Show tho' little understood  He only seeks the Power to do the Good  Thinks 'till he tries 'tis Godlike to dispose  And Gratitude still springs where Bounty flows  That every Grant sincere Affection wins  And where our Wants have End our Love begins  But those who long the Paths of State have trod  Learn from the Clamours of the murmuring Crowd  Which cramm'd yet craving still their Gates besiege  'Tis easier far to give than to oblige  This of Thy Conduct seems the nicest Part  The chief Perfection of the Statesman's Art  To give to fair Assent a fairer Face  And soften a Refusal into Grace  But few there are that can be truly kind  Or know to fix their Favours on the Mind  Hence some whene'er they would oblige offend  And while they make the Fortune lose the Friend  Still give unthank'd still squander not bestow  For great Men want not what to give but how  The Race of Men that follow Courts 'tis true  Think all they get and more than all their Due  Still ask but ne'er consult their own Deserts  And measure by their Interest not their Parts  From this Mistake so many Men we see  But ill become the Thing they wish'd to be  Hence Discontent and fresh Demands arise  More Power more Favour in the Great Man's Eyes  All feel a Want tho' none the Cause suspects  And hate their Patron for their own Defects  Such none can please but who reforms their Hearts  And when he gives them Places gives them Parts  As these o'erprize their Worth so sure the Great  May sell their Favour at too dear a Rate  When Merit pines while Clamour is preferr'd  And long Attachment waits among the Herd  When no Distinction where Distinction's due  Marks from the many the Superior few  When strong Cabal constrains them to be just  And makes them give at lastbecause they must  What Hopes that Men of real Worth should prize  What neither Friendship gives nor Merit buys  The Man who justly o'er the Whole presides  His well weigh'd Choice with wise Affections guides  Knows when to stop with Grace and when advance  Nor gives from Importunity or Chance  But thinks how little Gratitude is ow'd  When Favours are extorted not bestow'd  When safe on Shore ourselves we see the Crowd  Surround the Great importunate and loud  Thro' such a Tumult 'tis no easy Task  To drive the Man of real Worth to ask  Surrounded thus and giddy with the Show  'Tis hard for great Men rightly to bestow  From hence so few are skill'd in either Case  To ask with Dignity or give with Grace  Sometimes the Great seduc'd by Love of Parts  Consult our Genius but neglect our Hearts  Pleas'd with the glitt'ring Sparks that Genius flings  They lift us cow'ring on their Eagles Wings  Mark out the Flights by which themselves begun  And teach our dazzled Eyes to bear the Sun  Till we forget the Hand that made us great  And grow to envy not to emulate  To emulate a general Warmth implies  To reach the Virtues that make great Men rise  But Envy wears a mean malignant Face  And aims not at their Virtues but their Place  Such to oblige how vain is the Pretence  When every Favour is a fresh Offence  By which superior Power is still imply'd  And while it helps their Fortune hurts their Pride  Slight is the Hate Neglect or Hardships breed  But those who hate from Envy hate indeed  Since so perplex'd the Choice whom shall we trust  Methinks I hear thee cry the Brave and Just  The Man by no mean Fears or Hopes controul'd  Who serves thee from Affection not for Gold  Who love the Honest and esteem the Brave  Despise the Coxcomb but detest the Knave  No Shew of Parts the truly wise seduce  To think that Knaves can be of real Use  The Man who contradicts the publick Voice  And strives to dignify a worthless Choice  Attempts a Task that on that Choice reflects  And lends us Light to point out new Defects  One worthless Man that gains what he pretends  Disgusts a thousand unpretending Friends  And since no Art can make a Counter pass  Or add the Weight of Gold to mimick Brass  When Princes to bad Oar their Image join  They more debase the Stamp than raise the Coin  Be thine the Care true Merit to reward  And gain the Goodnor will that Task be hard  Souls form'd alike so quick by Nature blend  An honest Man is more than half thy Friend  Him no mean Views or Haste to rise shall sway  Thy Choice to sully or thy Trust betray  Ambition here shall at due Distance stand  Nor is Wit dangerous in an honest Hand  Besides if Failings at the Bottom lie  We view those Failings with a Lover's Eye  Tho' small his Genius let him do his best  Our Wishes and Relief supply the rest  Let others barter servile Faith for Gold  His Friendship is not to be bought or sold  Fierce Opposition he unmov'd shall face  Modest in Favour daring in Disgrace  To share thy adverse Fate alone pretend  In Power a Servant out of Power a Friend  Here pour thy Favours in an ample Flood  Indulge thy boundless Thirst of doing Good  Nor think that Good to him alone confin'd  Such to oblige is to oblige Mankind  If thus thy mighty Master's Steps thou trace  The Brave to cherish and the Good to grace  Long shalt thou stand from Rage and Faction free  And teach us long to love the King thro' Thee  Or fall a Victim dangerous to the Foe  And make him tremble when he strikes the Blow  While Honour Gratitude Affection join  To deck thy Close and brighten thy Decline  Illustrious Doom the Great when thus displac'd  With Friendship guarded and with Virtue grac'd  In awful Ruin like  Rome  's Senate fall  The Prey and Worship of the wondering  Gaul  No doubt to Genius some Reward is due  Excluding that were satyrizing You  But yet believe thy undesigning Friend  When Truth and Genius for thy Choice contend  Tho' both have Weight when in the Balance cast  Let Probity be first and Parts the last  On these Foundations if thou durst be great  And check the Growth of Folly and Deceit  When Party Rage shall droop thro' Length of Days  And Calumny be ripened into Praise  Then future Times shall to thy Worth allow  That Fame which Envy would call Flattery now  Thus far my Zeal tho' for the Task unfit  Has pointed out the Rocks where others split  By that inspir'd tho' Stranger to the Nine  And negligent of any Famebut Thine  I take the friendly but superfluous Part  You act from Nature what I teach from Art  ERRATUM  Pag lin for  general  r  generous  FINIS  Lately Published  EPISTLES ODES  c  written on several Subjects with a Translation of  Longinus  's Treatise on the Sublime By
