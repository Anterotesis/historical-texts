 DRAMATIC AND OTHER POEMS LETTERS ESSAYS c  By W HAWKINS M A Rector of  Little Casterton  in  Rutlandshire  late Poetry Professor in the University of  Oxford  and Fellow of  Pembroke College  VOL II  OXFORD PRINTED BY W JACKSON Sold by R and J DODSLEY in  PallMall  J RIVINGTON and J FLETCHER in  PaternosterRow  and W OWEN in  FleetStreet London  J FLETCHER and S PARKER in  Oxford  MDCCLVIII  To the Right Honourable GEORGE HENRY EARL of LITCHFIELD  My  LORD  ADDRESSES of this Nature which are too often fulsom Offerings to Vanity or servile Applications to Power when made to Persons of real Worth and Honour are at the same Time Compliments artfully paid by Authors to themselves While the Writer is descanting upon the high Birth inflexible Probity patriot Spirit humane Disposition and the polite and literary Accomplishments of his Patron he insinuates himself into the good Opinion of his Reader as one favoured with the Acquaintance and honoured by the Countenance and Regard of a Person thus  amiable and illustrious I shall not pretend my Lord wholly to disclaim all Views of this Kind in the present Address I have the Honour to make to you and accordingly should take a particular Pleasure in enlarging upon the above and other shining Qualities in your Lordship's Character did I not recollect that I have no Right to gratify the Public or myself at the Expence of your Lordship's private and personal Satisfaction  Indeed it is my present Interest rather to engage your Lordship's favourable Opinion of the following Performances and I know nothing more likly to do this than an Assurance that I have aim'd by a suitable Variety to adapt myself to almost all Sorts of Readers but immoral ones that in some Pieces I have attempted to render the Graces of Numbers and the Embellishments of Poetry subservient  to the Interests of Virtue and Religion that in others I have offered such critical Disquisitions as I hope will afford at least a rational Entertainment to Men of Taste in polite Literature and that in them all I have endeavoured occasionally to express myself with Dignity Elegance and Ease which by the way are not more the Characteristics of good Writing than of the Air Manner and Conversation of a certain Nobleman I have the Honour to be known to I look upon myself as apologizing to the Public when I am speaking to your Lordship and therefore have said thus much from a perfect Sense of the Consequence it must be to me as an Author to secure your Lordship's Approbation of my Writings  The Dedication of these to your Lordship will after all I fear be thought a  trifling Proof of my Respect and therefore I desire it may however be consider'd as a sincere Testimony of my Gratitude for the many Favours you have been pleased to confer on me the most material of which have been attended with this Circumstance of Credit and Satisfaction that they are to be attributed to your Lordship's free and unsolicited Kindness and Condescension  The Obligations I am under to your Lordship are not of a Nature to be mentioned here but this Opportunity of expressing a due Acknowledgment of them in the most ample and public Manner is with the greatest Pleasure taken by  My  LORD  Your  LORDSHIP  's Much oblig'd Most respectful and Obedient Servant W HAWKINS  THE THIMBLE  AN HEROICOMICAL POEM IN FIVE CANTOS  Illustrated with NOTES Critical and Explanatory  By  SCRIBLERUS SECUNDUS  Virginibus puerisque canto  HOR  The THIRD EDITION Corrected and Enlarged  TO Miss ANNA MARIA WOODFORD  MADAM  AS the Subject of the following Poem naturally led me to inscribe it to one of your Sex I could not but hope that the Justness of the present Address from one who has not the Happiness to be personally known to you would be a sufficient Apology for the Presumption of it But tho' I may have the Misfortune to incur your Displeasure by offending your Humility I shall even under the Sense of your Disapprobation have the Satisfaction to reflect that I have been guilty of a very artful Piece of Impertinence since by placing your Name before my Performance I have taken the most effectual Method to recommend it to the Public  Your Example Madam is a Reproach to the present indolent Generation your Glory is not established upon the personal Advantages you possess in so eminent a Manner which great as they are your good Sense assures you are at the best but the Subjects of present Admiration and can never be the Basis of a lasting Fame  Your Handywork Madam which has very justly a Place among the Curiosities of that famous University of which I have the Honour and Happiness to be an inconsiderable Member has rendered your Name immortal and your nice Management of the Needle that little but important Implement of Oeconomy has entitled you to the Reputation of the compleatest Housewife in  Europe  a Character to which all Virgins and Wives should aspire  You have taught us to acknowlege that the most minute Utensil of Art may  by an ingenious Application of it be made subservient in the highest Degree to the Honour of the Artist A Pin or a Needle in your Hands are Instruments as effectual for that Purpose as the Poet's Pen or the Hero's Sword  I am at present Madam in a very perplexed Situation of Mind I have the Pleasure to consider that I am now upon a Subject that must be agreeable to all my Readers and at the same time have the Mortification to recollect that 'tis distasteful to yourself  Though therefore all I could say in Commendation of your Merit the World would think too little yet as what I have said you will think too much I find myself under a Necessity of desiring your Pardon for this Liberty I have taken and for another in the fourth Canto of this Poem wherein I have presumed to put a short Prediction relating  to your amiable Character into the Mouth of the Queen of Love This I need not otherwise have intimated since every one must at first Sight perceive that this Prediction is properly applicable to none but yourself  After what I have said Madam may I venture to hope you have some Patience in Reserve for the Poem 'Twas design'd for your Amusement and if that Design be answered my Ambition is satisfied And indeed to say Truth I have so thorough a Confidence in your good Nature that I am persuaded you will look with a favourable Eye upon the following Performance though not in Justice yet in Pity to  Your unknown humble Servant  The  AUTHOR  THE PREFACE  I Have always considered a Preface as an Author's Apology for his Performance in which he has an undoubted Liberty of saying as much as he pleases in Favour of himself As I cannot therefore but be apprehensive of the Success of the following Piece I must beg Leave to take this comfortable Privilege as well as my Poetical Brethren The principal Circumstances I have to urge in my own Behalf are that this Poem is the first Production of a young and unexperienced Author excepting a few trifling Pieces in the  Magazines  and that I am so far from bidding Defiance to the Critics that I address myself to them in the modest and  submissive Terms of  By your Leave  GENTLEMEN  As to the Poem itself I have endeavoured in some particular Passages to imitate the Manner of Mr  Pope  's  Rape of the Lock  upon a Presumption that such Imitation would be deemed meritorious in so young a Writer as myself I ought likewise to acknowlege that I had in View the Episode of the  Patten  in Mr  Gay  's  Trivia  How far I have reached the Spirit required in this Kind of Poetry must be left to the Reader to whose Candour and Judgment I submit the following Poem  THE THIMBLE  THE THIMBLE c The Author by this simple Title of his Poem has very judiciously escaped the Censure which most modern Poets have incured by their Affectation of Antiquity in their TitlePages This excellent Poem might with as much Propriety have been called  The Thimblead  or  The Thimbleiad  as Mr  Pope  's was intituled  The Dunciadâ–ª  But such Imitation appeared trifling and obvious to our Author and at best had been  malapropos  and nothing to the  Point  of a  Needle  I wish however I could as well account for his calling it an  Heroicomical  Poem rather than an  Heroic  one which I take it indisputably to be It has its Action its Fable its Manners its Sentiment and its Diction which are the constituent Parts of the  Epic  Poem And though in respect of all these it may in some Instances differ from the Plan of the Antients and the Doctrine of  Aristotle  I cannot think it thereby degraded into a different and lower Species of Poetry Mr  Addison  himself allows  Aristotle  's Rules for  Epic  Poetry which he has drawn from his Reflections upon  Homer  cannot be supposed to quadrate exactly with the  Heroic  Poems which have been or may be made since his Time  See  Spec N  o  For this Reason it would be ridiculous to object to the Action of this Poem its Deficiency in Point of Greatness or Importancea supposed necessary Qualification in the Action of the  Epopee  and indeed admitting it so to be the Objection is founded in false and improper Ideas of  Greatness and Importance  and in the wrong Impressions made upon Minds of a romantic Turn by the Exploits of antient Heroes and the Manners and Customs of barbarous and uncivilized Nations Because what was a proper Subject for  Epic  Poetry in the Days of  Homer  or  Virgil  would be shocking and absurd in so  refined and delicate an Age as this  The Action of this Poem is abundantly important for these Times of  genteel Indolence and superb Tranquility  and the Author all the while instead of dropping his Acquaintance with the Antients artfully makes use of it upon many Occasions without a Possibility of giving Offence to any  fine Lady or Gentleman  by such  robust and indelicate  Imagery as that with which the old  Epic  aboundsWe shall occasionally shew in the Course of our Criticisms that he rarely in any respect deviates from the antient Plan without improving itWhat has been already advanced will justify likewise his making a Lady the principal personage in the PoemIf female Characters are respectable even in the Writings of  Homer  and  Virgil  Decency sure Propriety and Complaisance required they should have the first Place in the Poem before usThus much we thought necessary to premise in general we shall proceed to farther Remarks as they are suggested by the Poem itself  CANTO I  WHAT Art divine  What Art divine  c The Moral of an  Epic  Poem may be either positively laid down or virtually couched in what the Critics call the  Exordium  That of the Iliad of  Homer  is clearly expressed in the Proposition of the Action of the Poem those of the Odyssey and of the Aeneid are implicitly contained in their respective  Exordiums  The Plan of the  Thimble  which in its Moral is inferiour to neither of them is formed upon Industry and its Rewards as is sufficiently intimated in these first Lines of the Poem  the shining  Thimble  found  To shield the Finger militant around  Now first my Verse reveals Ye Virgins hear  Attend ye Matrons and ye Belles give Ear  For you the Infant Muse essays to sing  For you she flutters on her tender Wing  To you the tributary Strains belong  "Then  Pope  's New Dunciad Line  take at once the Poet and the Song"  When Woman's chief Concerns were Love and Play  And trifling was the Bus'ness of the Day  When few one Hour of precious Time could spare  To mend an Apron or to say a Pray'r  Fannia  the fairest of the female Train  That shone at Court or blest the rural Plain  In the nice Toils of Industry was skill'd  And knew with Art the Needle Spear to wield  Whether she work'd the gaylyblooming Flow'r  Or drew in ductile Silk the verdant Bow'r  Here glow'd the spangled Firmament on high  And all the Glories of the azure Sky  Here wide expanded blaz'd the bright Abodes  And  Jove  inthron'd  c As this is the first Place where the Name of a superiour Being occurs in this Work it may be proper to obviate the Exceptions or rather the Cavils which a few superstitious or illnatured Judges may be apt to make to the Machinery of the Poem which consists of the  Gods and Goddesses  of the old  Pagan Theology  It might be sufficient to stop the Mouths of such to observe that Poets are of no Religion and that by Virtue of the Prerogative Poetical the  Poetica Licentia  an Author may adopt what System he pleases 'Tis true Mr  Addison  banishes the  Heathen Deities  from all modern Poetry except the  MockHeroic  Spec N  o  But then he passed this Sentence at a Time when  Christianity  was generally we may presume  practised  as well as  formally established  among us a Sentence therefore that by no Means affects our Author as Things are now happily circumstanced Our Bard will certainly pass for a good  Protestant  with the  BeauMonde  and need not fear offending the Religion of his Country as that great Critic expresses it Spec N  o  and indeed I cannot see why his  Pagan  System should not be universally received as it not only stands clear of all  Popish Errors  but likewise has in some respects  reformed  the old  Theology  of  Homer  himself which we shall have an Opportunity to shew  And  Jove  inthron'd above his Vassal Gods  For  Pallas'  self had deign'd t' assist the Fair  And more than human Workmanship was thereâ–ª  Sometimes she copied from the Earth below  The spotted  LapDog  or the flaming  Beau  Or form'd the  Bird  or shap'd the slender  Tree  A whole Creation in Epitome  IMITATIONS  Envy itself was dumb c  Envy itself is dumb in Wonder lost  And Factions strive which shall applaud 'em most  Mr  Addison  's Campaign  Envy itself was dumb in wonder lost  And Ladies strove which should applaud her most  Each Morn she work'd but work'd with nicest Care  To save her Finger from the fatal Scar  For yet no Armour cas'd the Flesh around  But Plaits of Silk or sev'nfold Paper bound  Unhappy  Fannia  that was wont to wield  The pointed Spear without the bossy Shield  Thrice happy  Fannia  in the Gift bestow'd  The  Thimble  Shield the Labour of a God  But now her Charms had swell'd the Trump of Fame  And spread to distant  TeaTables  her Name  Each cringing Fop around her Smiles implor'd  Admir'd her Genius but her Face ador'd  Each sigh'd and wept and vow'd her Love to gain  But each had sigh'd and wept and vow'd in vain  For  Fannia  triumph'd in her Beauty's Arts  And view'd with Scorn whole Hecatombs of Hearts  Yet most respected  c The Character of  Fannia  the Heroine of the Poem having been before sufficiently displayed to the Reader in the Picture of an  industrious Coquet  the Author next proceeds in a most lively Manner to particularize that of her favourite  Cynthio  the second Person in the  Thimble  Both these Characters are truly  Epic  "In the laying down which the Poet as Mr  Pope  well observes of  Homer  rather studied  Nature  than  Perfection"  See the Note at V of  Pope  's Iliad B i The Characters of a  fine Gentleman and Lady  though they be not  morally  beautiful as the same excellent Writer observes in regard to the Character of  Homer  's Hero are still  poetically  perfect  Yet most respected was a wellbred Lord  And most respected as he best ador'd  His soft Address the coldest Dame might move  Smooth were his Words for ev'ry Word was Love  Loaded with Lace and deck'd in silken State  He strutted insignificantly great  Affected Pomp and Equipage and Shew  And all the Nothings that compound a Beau  He danc'd and sung took Snuff and crack'd a Fan  And at the best but border'd upon Man  Flambeaux perfum'd wide blaz'd his gay Approach  And wanton  Cupids  breath'd upon his Coach  IMITATIONS  O  Liberty  thou Goddess heav'nly bright  Profuse of Bliss and pregnant with Delight  Eternal Pleasures in thy Presence reign  And smiling Plenty leads thy wanton Train  Eas'd of her Load Subjection grows more light  And Poverty looks chearful in thy Sight  Thou mak'st the gloomy Face of Nature gay  Giv'st Beauty to the Sun and Pleasure to the Day  O  Vanity  thou gaudy tinsel Queen  In Courts in Cities and in Country seen  Eternal Fopp'ries in thy Presence reign  And grinning Folly leads thy wanton Train  Eas'd of it's Load ev'n Dulness grows more light  And Ignorance looks chearful in thy Sight  Thou mak'st th' unmeaning Face with Pride to glow  Giv'st Brightness to the Fool and Beauty to the Beau  Gay  Cynthio  daily kneel'd at  Venus'  Shrine  And burnt sweet Incense to the Pow'r benign  Oft too he crav'd  Apollo  's rhyming Art  For tuneful Numbers melt the hardest Heart  The  Godhead  halfconsented to his Pray'r  The rest the Winds disperst thro' Fields of Air  And gave him Wit enoughto please the Fair  And now th' enamour'd Bard half Wit half Fool  Wooes in LoveSongs melodiously dull  His sweettun'd Strains the Fair one's Praise rehearse  And crow'd all Nature's Beauties in his Verse  Does  Fannia  smile the Sun breaks forth to View  Does  Fannia  weep 'tis Morning's pearly Dew  Whene'er she breathes the fanning Zephyrs blow  And for her Breast the Alps sustain their Snow  Compar'd with her's the finest Tinctures fail  The Lilly reddens and the Rose turns pale  Thus his warm Suit the Beau with Art addrest  And proudly triumph'd to be slighted least  'Twas Rapture but to gain one balmy Kiss  And fondly flutter round the Brink of Bliss  Full of herself his Wishes she deny'd  A Woman's ruling Passion is her Pride  Enough impartial Favours to bestow  On her lov'd  LapDog c The third earthly Personage mentioned in the Poem is a  LapDog  in respect of which Creature and the  Parrot  c c it will be doing Justice to our Author to remark once for all that as the Subject of his Poem would not on account chiefly of the  Shortness  of the Action admit of a considerable Variety of  human  Characters he was under a Necessity of introducing some Persons not strictly  Epic  Mr  Addison  has observed that none of the Critics either antient or modern have laid down Rules to circumscribe the Action of an  Epic  Poem with any determined Number of Years Days or Hours Spec N  o      Milton  laboured under a like Difficulty and found Means to extricate himself by bringing into his Poem Actors of a Nature purely  fictitious  and  allegorical  and surely if  Sin  and  Death  have been by the Critics esteemed proper Personages in that Poem  Dogs  and  Kittens  which are  real  though  subordinate  Personages may be allowed a Place in the Company of  Gentlemen and Ladies  with a Proviso that they do not interrupt ConversationAfter all the Apology may be needless for the  present  State of the  Epopee  agreeably to the above Representation of it requires the Assistance of these Animals as much as the  antient  did that of Horses c c  On her lov'd  LapDog  and her fav'rite  Beau  Thus bless'd with ev'ry Joy this Life can boast  The Ladies' Wonder and the Coxcomb's Toast  What could the Fair one's Peace of Mind annoy  What could such solid Happiness destroy  But ah no human Pleasures are sincere  Is there an Eye that never shed a Tear  Fate  rules o'er all at whose severe Decree  O'er the rich Gown flow Deluges of Tea  Fate  hurls the Mighty down to deep Disgrace  And plows with lasting Scars the smoothest Face  O'er all Things mortal acts with lawless Will  And  Fannia  was alass but mortal still  When now the Morn  c Here the Action of the Poem properly commences which takes up but two entire Days in which Space of Time however are comprized a Number of striking and interesting Incidents  When now the Morn had chas'd the Shades away  O fatal Morn and inauspicious Day  Fannia  arose and hail'd the grateful Light  Shock'd at the horrid Visions of the Night  Yet still strange Terrours all her Thoughts molest  And Apprehension labour'd in her Breast  Then  Betty  with dejected Look she cry'd  Three Times on  Betty  call'd and three Times sigh'd  Some sad Mischance awaits me e'er the Sun  Once more his Course from East to West shall run  Fantastic Slumbers c  Fantastic Slumbers have disturb'd my Brain  And rack'd my Senses with a wakeful Pain  And mystic Dreams as bearded Matrons shew  Are good Prognostics or the Types of Woe  Sure at this Hour some baleful Planet reigns  Didst thou not mark  c The  Religious  of all Ages have laid a great Stress on Omens and Presignifications of future Events by Dreams Flights of Birds c in Compliance with which antient and rational Notion our Author represents his  Heroine  alarmed and terrified by very affecting and infallible though modern Appearances  Didst thou not mark last Night the Coffee Grains  Methought the Taper's Flame was ting'd with Blue  And Coals strangeshapen from the Embers flew  Late as I wander'd in a lonely Grove  E'er yet my Thoughts began to teem with Love  A wither'd Gypsy whisper'd in my Ear  "Misfortune shall befall thy twentieth Year"  That fatal Period of my Life is come  And ev'ry Hour swells big with  Fannia  's Doom  Yet O ye Pow'rs preserve me from Disgrace  Let me still keep my Virtueand my Face  O make my Bosom proof to Love's Alarms  Protect my Youth and shelter all my Charms  Fantastic Slumbers c  While thus the Maid presag'd Disaster nigh  Great  Jove  conven'd the Senate of the Sky  And round assembled the celestial Clan  He strok'd his  Mustachoes  and thus began  Aethereal Pow'rs behold in doleful State  Our bestlov'd  Fannia  moans approaching  Fate  See how she views yon glitt'ring Needle round  Nor deems her Woe long destin'd in a Wound  Shall we avert the Fair one's Doom toDay  Or shall we give the spleenful  Fates  their Way  â€   While thus the Maid cGreat  Jove  conven'd  c Though a superficial Reader might infer from a preceding Passage in this Canto relating to  Fate  that all Events are predetermined by Necessity it is plain from  Jupiter  's Design in convening this Council in which he appears willing to interpose his superiour Power in Favour of  Fannia  that  Fate  itself is by our Author supposed to be subject to his Controul and Superintendency  Jupiter  in  Homer  acts the same Part in the Cases of  Sarpedon  and  Hector  This Deity we may here observe appears in the  Greek  Poet and his  Latin  Imitator to great Disadvantage if compared with the Figure he makes in this incomparable PoemIn the first Place  Jupiter  himself betrays great Weakness and Infirmity  See  B xxii of the Iliad by his almost  unmanly  but surely  ungodly  Lamentation over the  Fate  of  Hector  In the next Place the  Eyebrows  and the  Hair  mentioned by  Homer  upon another Occasion but omitted by  Virgil  those chief Pieces of Imagery from whence Mr  Pope  tells us  Phidi  s  took the Idea of a Countenance proper for the King of Gods and Men are evidently inferiour in Point of Majesty and Respectableness to the  Mustachoes  of our AuthorAgain the  Juno  of  Homer  the Goddess of Marriage is an eternal  Billingsgate  and has entail'd from that blind Poet's Days Contempt and Reproach upon the State of Wedlock which our Author in the ensuing Allegory of which more byandby laudably attempts to remove  Of all the Damsels on yon earthly Sphere  Like  Fannia  none our Deities revere  Daily the Maid renews her pious Toil  And Heav'n regales with Steams of fattest Oil  While yearly as the solemn cTwo milkwhite Kittens  c A much  genteeler  Sacrifice and consequently more grateful to the Deities than those of  Oxen  c offered by the  aukward  and  nasty  Heroes of  Homer  and  Virgil  For Proof of this we might transcribe the Account of the Sacrifice in the first Book of the Iliad but forbear to do it in pure Tenderness to  polite Ears  We will venture however to subjoin Mr  Pope  's  Translation  who was a very  clean  Writer and upon this as well as many other Occasions has greatly softened the Indelicacy of the Original  The Limbs they sever from th' inclosing Hide  The Thighs selected to the Gods divide  On these in double Cawls involv'd with Art  The choicest Morsels lay from ev'ry Part  B i L  The Thighs thus sacrific'd and Entrails drest  Th' Assistants part transfix and roast the rest  What gross Ideas does this Description convey Our Author wisely thought it sufficient to inform us that his  Heroine  yearly offered a  Kitten  to the Gods without officiously entering into the Particulars of the Dissection or of the throwing  the Fat in the Fire  cSuch is his Regard to  Decency  While yearly as the solemn Rites succeed  Two milkwhite  Kittens  on our Altars bleed  So spoke the Sire of Men and Gods above  And smiling thus rejoin'd the Queen of Love  Father 'tis just this Pity to the Fair  A helpless Maid is  Jove  's peculiar Care  Bright  Fannia  shines the first of human Race  In winning Sweetness and in Bloom of Face  Since my fam'd Fav'rite  Helen  's pow'rful Charms  Rouz'd Heav'n and Earth to dreadful Deeds of Arms  For such a Maid shall  Fate  Distress ordain  And spoil such Features with the Rage of Pain  To whom the Goddess with the silver Bow  Sister thy Arts by endless Proof we know  By thee seduc'd the fairest Nymphs among  My huntress Train have left the Virgin Throng  Fannia  my Vot'ry late and chief Delight  Whose Thought by Day was chaste and Dream by Night  Soon I foresee will fall thy Victim sure  I mark her Bosom heave with Sighs impure  When  Cynthio  twines her Hair or twirls her Fan  For there's Contagion in the Touch of Man  Let not great  Jove  his own Decrees abate  But leave th' abandon'd Virgin to her Fate  Then slow uprose the God's majestic Queen  Unjust she cry'd  Diana  is thy Spleen  Nor  Venus  claim thy softer Arts Applause  Let Love be subject to connubial Laws  So  Fannia  still may shine supremely fair  Belov'd of Gods and Heav'n's peculiar Care  And  Jove  the Horrours of her present Fate  May or remove or kindly mitigate  Next the great  Pallas  blueey'd Goddess rose  Not like the  Pallas  thund'ring midst her Foes  When allbesmear'd with Dust and Sweat and Gore  She bids the furious Voice of Battle roar  A mild and graceful Air her Looks assume  As when presiding o'er the peaceful Loom  'Twas reason'd well she cry'd and I beseech  Thanks may be paid to  Juno  for her Speech  Fate  will have Way and who shall stem its Tide  Great  Jove  oppos'd not when his  Hector  dy'd  The Wound the beauteous Artist must endure  Tho' cruel  Fate  inflicts the Gods may cure  Venus  implor'd shall due Compassion take  As well for  Cynthio  's as for  Fannia  's Sake  And  Vulcan  's Art a Target shall prepare  Henceforth to shield the Finger of the Fair  Thus shall the Perils of the Needle cease  And  Hymen  's Bands  c It has been observed of the Allegories of  Homer  that many of them are forced and scarce reconcileable to Truth and MoralityIn this Respect the Author of  The Thimble  has much the Advantage of his PredecessorIn the Allegory before us we have a tacit but lively Reproof of unlawful  Love  a Display of the Benefits and Advantages of  Matrimony  and a Declaration of the  Wisdom  of its Institution  And  Hymen  's Bands shall tie the Knot of Peace  So be't if so wills  Jove  The Parent God  Shook his ambrosial Locks and gave the Nod  Now sip th' Immortals their celestial  Tea  And quaff nectareous Draughts of  Ratifia  Apollo  sung a  Ballad  and the  Nine  With  Tabor  and with  Pipe  in Concert join  Young  Ganimede c The Conclusion of this Canto is a happy Imitation and Improvement of that of the First Book of the IliadWhether the spruce young  Ganymede  is not a much more proper  Waiter  for the  female  Deities than an old limping  Blacksmith  let the Ladies the best Judges in this Case determine  Young  Ganymede  his Office dext'rous plies  And all applaud the  Footboy  of the Skies  END of the FIRST CANTO  CANTO II  NO sweetlyflowing Tale I now rehearse  But Scratches Wounds and Bloodshed stain the Verse  Ye vet'ran Band of Milliners give Ear  And ev'ry Sempstress drop a pitying Tear  O listen to the Melancholy Lay  While I recount the Horrours of the Day  O for his Numbers  c Both  Homer  and  Virgil  as our Author here in Conformity to their Practice renew their Invocation of the Muse at particular Periods and proper Intervals of their Poems  Tu Vatem tu Diva mone  AENEID Lib vii L  Major Rerum mihi nascitur Ordo  Majus Opus moveo  O for his Numbers that describ'd the Shield  Of great  Pelides  issuing to the Field  Or clad in Arms terrific from afar  Or rushing dreadful through the Ranks of War  The Virgin sat deep sunk in pensive Thought  Betty  my Work she cry'd and  Betty  brought  Oft have my Morning Labours sooth'd my Grief  What Wretch e'er found in Idleness Relief  How blind are Mortals in this hapless State  We rush to Ruin and embrace our Fate  Six Needles  c There is a beautiful Cast of Antiquity in this Passage which we only hint to the judicious Reader desiring him to take this Hint along with him throughout the Poem  Six Needles in tremendous Range appear  Each a dire Emblem of the Warriour's Spear  A while she view'd them all with careful Eyes  Then grasp'd a Jav'lin of enormous Size  Next as impatient for the Toil she grew  Her shining Scissars from the Sheath she drew  Her GrandDame's Gift as antient Memoirs say  A just Reward for many a wellwork'd Day  With active Haste her nimble Fingers move  Curl the gay Vine and form the mimic Grove  But as her Finger with resistless Force  Through double Plaits pursu'd its rapid Course  The treach'rous Needle brokethe headless Dart  Deepgor'd her Flesh and pierc'd herto the Heart  The purple Blood distain'd her Arm around  And half her Soul came rushing through the Wound  Then as her Bosom glow'd with sudden Fire  She spurn'd her  LapDog  in her peevish Ire  Across the Room with furious Speed she flew  And Tables Chairs and Cabinets o'erthrew  Her hideous Cries the vocal Walls resound  IMITATIONS  Air blacken'd roar'd the Thunder groan'd the Ground  Dryden  's Fables  Poll  chatter'd scream'd the  Kitten  shook the  Ground  So when the  Diomed  See the Fifth Book of the Iliad Line c  Greek  that with Immortals strove  Wounded in impious Rage the Queen of Love  To Heav'n's high Roof the Goddess rais'd her Cries  And the harsh Shriek run thrilling through the Skies  Here lay the Ruins of an ample Bowl  The Pride and Comfort of her Grandsire's Soul  This oft inspir'd the loudlysounding Jest  And crown'd with Jollity the Nuptial Feast  Unhurt by Midnight Broils uncrack'd by Age  It fell the Wreck of  Fannia  's heedless Rage  At length fatigu'd with Anger she survey'd  The fatal Massacre herself had made  Then as she sat all pensive and alone  In secret Grief she made her piteous Moan  So shuns a wounded Bird the feather'd Race  And mournful in some solitary Place  To Woods and Rocks he tunes the plaintive Lay  And Echoes waft the gentle Sounds away  And oh she cried Is this the dreadful Stroke  Which  Omens  threaten'd and which  Visions  spoke  Ah how have I incens'd the Pow'rs above  What Crime provokes the Wrath of angry  Jove  Yearly my loaded Altars blaze in vain  With plenteous Fat of purring Victims slain  Doom'd as I am to Pangs of endless Pain  Pale meagre ghostlike how shall I appear  In bright Assemblies of the Gay and Fair  Old Maids will triumph with insulting Voice  And o'er their flowing Cups  c Justice to the fair Sex requires us to suppose the Author by  Cups  here means  TeaCups  And o'er their flowing Cups the Belles rejoice  A sad Recluse no longer must I roam  But spin a tedious Length of Days at Home  Ev'n  Cynthio  cruel  Cynthio  spreads my Shame  Adieu to Love to Conquest and to Fame  Did I for this my blooming Beauties grace  And heighten all the Lustre of my Face  For this before my Glass whole Hours beguile  And heave my Breast and force the killing Smile  Or bid my Cheeks with artful Blushes glow  Or teach the wanton Tresses where to flow  Could I not Tasks less dang'rous undertake  Refine the Jelly or compose the Cake  Or mould the pliant Paste with nicest Art  And with high Ramparts fortify the Tart  O blast that Day ye Pow'rs with Plagues severe  When first my Fingers pois'd the pointed Spear  Then may no joyful Sounds invade the Skies  But ravish'd Maids Complaints and Widows Cries  Then be untun'd the Music of the Spheres  Then may no Fiddle glad the Dancers Ears  No Ballad then be sung with screaming Note  Nor soft Airs warbl'd in the Eunuch's Throat  Then may the Sun withdraw his chearful Light  Nor pendent Lustres gild the Face of Night  This said with Silk her bleeding Flesh she bound  While ev'ry Thought hung brooding o'er the Wound  On  Poll  she cast a sad desponding Look  And patted  Daphne  with a feeble Stroke  But now bright Lamps began the Midnight Day  And blazing Flambeaux drove the Stars away  The Fair expects her Beau with anxious Fears  When at his wonted Hour the Fop appears  With conscious Shame her Finger she withdrew  Nor durst expose the fatal Wound to View  Long he survey'd for Love takes all Alarms  With deep Surprize her disconcerted Charms  Then sweet and tuneful as the dying Swan  In soft condoling Words he thus began  What sad Mischance what unfear'd Danger nigh  Flushes that Cheek and dims that sparkling Eye  Lies some near Friend upon his dying Bed  Or has the Light'ning struck thy Monkey dead  Has the fell Mercer just produc'd his Score  And having trusted long will trust no more  Or didst thou mark last Ev'ning at the Play  A richer Virgin or a Nymph more gay  Say does my Fair for brighter Gems repine  Each  India  's choicest Diamonds shall be thine  For thee the  East  its Treasures shall unfold  And Earth unbosom all her Hoards of Gold  O name thy Wants and tell me thy Distress  Care shall remove or Pity make it less  This said and sure his Lordship said enough  With Elegance he took a Pinch of Snuff  Then she No Language can my Grief remove  Nor all the Pow'rs of Hartshorn and of  Jove  Cynthio  thy Truth alone can give me Aid  And skreen from sad Reproach a wretched Maid  If in each deepfetch'd Sigh each falling Tear  Each solemn Vow thy Heart has been sincere  By Secrecy thy fair Affection prove  For Silence is the noblest Mark of Love  Ev'n  Fannia  sues this Favour to obtain  Fannia  that never su'd to Man in vain  She said and fix'd her Eyes upon the Ground  And with a Blush disclos'd the reeking Wound  Shock'd at the Sight of Blood replied the Peer  'Tis done and this was  Cynthio  's greatest Fear  Oft have I seen thy bright Embroid'ry shine  Oft have I curst the perilous Design  Thou born to flourish in the Pride of State  Idly secure and indolently great  Had'st nought to do with dang'rous Feats of Arms  Such Conflicts suit not with a Lady's Charms  Domestic Toils the servile female grace  Enough for thee to glory in a Face  How rash was she that grasp'd the Needle first  Pernicious Weapon Instrument accurst  'Twas  Alluding to the Monument in  Westminster Abbey  of a Lady whose Death is said to have been occasioned by the Prick of a Needle  this that once destroy'd a  British  Maid  Her Needle's Point to ling'ring Death betray'd  In those sad Vaults where Horrour spreads her Wings  Where rest the Bones of Poets and of Kings  The hapless Fair in Marble Record stands  The Victim of her own industrious Hands  O call to Mind her Life and Beauty lost  Dread all edg'd Tools but dread the Needle most  Why down thy Cheek descends the pearly Rill  Fannia  is wounded but is  Fannia  still  The sad Disgrace with patient Heart endure  Nor  Cynthio  shall divulge but wait the Cure  This Night my Soul shall breathe a fervent Pray'r  And deprecate the Horrours of the Scar  Thy wounded Finger  Venus  shall restore  But vent'rous Beauty trust to Steel no more  So spoke the Peer to sooth the drooping Maid  And his vast Stores of Eloquence display'd  Lull'd by his melting Words her Terrours cease  And the soft Sounds restor'd her wonted Peace  At length the mighty Theme exhausts his Art  And empty'd all the Nonsense of his Heart  But now the Tea remov'd the Prattle o'er  And all the Scandal of the Day before  The Baron took his Leave and left the Fair  And his gilt Chariot rattled o'er the Square  Fannia  at length in Slumbers clos'd her Eyes  And Men and Monkies in Delusion rise  END of the SECOND CANTO  CANTO III  NOW all lay hush'd  Now all lay hush'd  c The Poets are fond of giving us Descriptions of the Morning or the NightThis excellent NightPiece of our Author we think equal to any Thing of its Kind in antient or modern Poetry  in solitary Night  And distant Stars diffus'd a solemn Light  The World appear'd a desert silent Scene  And all around was dreadfully serene  Now ghastly stalk'd a melancholy Train  By Knife by Halter and by Poison slain  Whose woful Mem'ries  Grubstreet  Bards prolong  In dismal Story or in doleful Song  Nor Schoolboys Shout was heard nor Carman's Roar  Ev'n Winds were still and Women spoke no more  The Sons of Men dissolv'd in Slumbers lay  And Slaves and Kings forgot the Toils of Day  But wakeful Cares disturb'd the Baron's Brain  And weary'd Nature call'd for Rest in vain  Anxious to ease the sadlywounded Fair  To  Venus  he address'd his Midnight Pray'r  Great  Paphian  Queen bright Deity of Love  Whom all below confess and all above  If e'er with Gifts thy Altars I have crown'd  Or deck'd with flow'ry Wreaths thy Shrine around  If I have taught my tender Soul to own  No Pow'rs but thee and thy allconqu'ring Son  If by thy Aid I ken Love's secret Fire  Each budding Wish and ev'ry fond Desire  Read in the Virgin's Eyes her inward Smart  And know each Symptom of a Lovesick Heart  Renew thy Favours oft bestow'd before  And hear me now or never hear me more  Behold my  Fannia  late a Virgin bright  As Love can fancy or as Verse can write  Now see her sad dejected and forlorn  That once was chearful as the rising Morn  With allconsuming Grief she wastes away  Ev'n She the Fair the Witty and the Gay  Pensive she moans her wounded Finger's Smart  And sinks from all her Loftiness of Heart  O grant my Boon and ease the Virgin's Pain  Ease it to bless Mankind and me again  With sovereign Balm the shameful Scar remove  And teach O teach her to relent to Love  So shall each Beau with Spleen and Envy see  The Mistress of the World subdu'd by me  The yielding Fair shall ev'ry Charm resign  And  Hymen  shall our Hearts in lasting Union join  Thus far with wakeful Zeal the Baron said  Slumbers ensu'd and nods the heavy Head  Venus  with Pity heard the Beau's Request  And thus the stripling God of Love address'd  My Son thy Bow and keenest Shafts prepare  'Tis thine to humble this imperious Fair  Enough the Maid has seen with high Disdain  The Coxcomb's Anguish and the  Fopling  's Pain  At length herself shall own Love's pow'rful Sway  For all must once the Laws of Love obey  And slighted Beaux shall bless the Vengeance of this Day  Cynthio  the Bright that yonder sleeping lies  Whose Fires perpetual on my Altars rise  In vain the Force of ev'ry pleasing Art  Has try'd to soften that obdurate Heart  To him the Fair her Beauties shall resign  His be the glorious Prize the Conquest thine  But first some sov'reign Med'cine must be found  To ease the Torments of the fatal Wound  And see within this Crystal are contain'd  Drops which from wholsom Herbs long since were drain'd  The wholsom Herbs in  Jove  's fam'd  Crete  Island grow  And flourish fresh on  Ida  's lofty Brow  'Twas this my bestlov'd  Aeneas  See the Twelfth Book of the  Aeneid  V c  Offspring once restor'd  When all  Troy  trembl'd for her wounded Lord  This healing Juice shall cure the Virgin's Pain  And  Fannia  's Smiles shall chear the World again  Hence let us quick my Son to Earth repair  This Night shall be fulfill'd the Baron's Pray'r  She said and o'er her snowy Shoulders threw  A shining Mantle of an azure Hue  Two silken Knots her flowing Hair divide  And  Cupid  arm'd came smiling by her Side  Wrap'd in a sable Cloud they took their Way  Like Lightning darting through the Realms of Day  Swift as they past Perfumes divine they shed  And now hung hov'ring o'er the Virgin's Bed  O'er the wide Room a Taper's steady Light  Cast a pale Lustre and dispell'd the Night  The lofty Cieling glorious to behold  Was carv'd and studded o'er with Stars of Gold  The ample Walls vast Folds of Tap'stry grace  Here bright  Diana  seem'd to urge the Chace  Panting behind her came her Virgin Train  And the huge Boar ran foaming o'er the Plain  Here  Daphne  sought the Shelter of the Wood  And here with eager Steps the God pursu'd  Pleas'd

promiscuous Race  Two rampant Lions at each Corner stood  The dreadful Guardians of the sacred Wood  Sullen the brittle Savages look'd down  And the terrific China seem'd to frown  Th' Immortals next the wellwrought Bed survey'd  Where lay dissolv'd in Sleep the lovely Maid  Wrapt in sweet Dreams of Conquest Love and Play  Pleas'd she renew'd the Triumphs of the Day  Disdainful  IMITATIONS

glitt'ring Pomp the lofty Bed  It strikes as ev'ry rapid Hour glides round  It strikes Mortality is in the Sound  Oh did the Belles while yet in Beauty's Prime  Take warning from these Records of their Time  Think ev'ry Year may steal away a Grace  And prey unheeded on the fairest Face  Conscious of fading Charms they'd lay aside  Each Art coquetish and each Air of Pride  Nor blast their Lovers Hopes by long Delay  But yield those Beauties which must soon decay  Venus  at length a golden Quill espy'd  That once adorn'd a gaudy Peacock's Side  This pen'd the Fair one's Thoughts with wond'rous Art  And told the soft Emotions of her Heart  Describ'd her inmost Soul without Disguise  And Truths deny'd to Man's unhallow'd Eyes  Lo in the sacred Drops the shining Plume  She dyes and heav'nly Odours fill the Room  With this she gently bath'd the swelling Wound  It heal'd it clos'd and all the Part was sound  Cupid  beheld and Be that Glory thine  He cry'd but now behold a Work of mine  Coy Maids and haughty Belles revere me all  Beauty must yield and Woman's Pride must fall  For now an inward Pang the Fair shall feel  Not all the Pow'rs of Heav'n and Earth can heal  He said he bit his Lip and drew his Bow  And view'd exulting the defenceless Foe  Then with malicious Zeal he shot the Dart  That fatal lodg'd deep sunk in  Fannia  's Heart  Then thrice was heard the wounded Virgin's Groan  And thrice the  Parrot  scream'd his hideous Moan  Thrice bark'd the  LapDog  from his downy Bed  And thrice the  Kitten  rear'd her drowsy Head  Alas how shortliv'd is all human Pow'r  The Pride of Years is blasted in an Hour  All the gay Plans of Conquest all the Schemes  The Maid had form'd are fled like Morning Dreams  The Baron shall possess her Beauty's Store  And  Fanny  must insult Mankind no more  Then  Venus  thus address'd the sleeping Fair  O Thou thrice blest in Heav'n's peculiar Care  Thou that can'st all the Gifts of Nature boast  Charge of Immortals and the Mortals Toast  Revere the Counsels of the Pow'rs above  Forego thy Empire and submit to Love  Here cease the Triumphs of thy conqu'ring Charms  Decreed by Fate to  Cynthio  's faithful Arms  Nor with Reluctance yield for thou bright Maid  Enough hast rul'd and Man enough obey'd  Bless this auspicious Night nor henceforth fear  To lift with artful Hand the pointed Spear  Safely the dang'rous Weapon shalt thou wield  Thy Finger guarded by a sacred Shield  Vulcan  himself the Target shall prepare  That arms for Fight the gallant God of War  So shall thy Needle still extend thy Fame  And Ages yet to come admire thy Name  The pleasing Tale shall dwell on ev'ry Tongue  And grace the Numbers of some Poet's Song  And each bright Virgin each industrious Fair  Hereafter fearless of the fatal Scar  My Name shall highextol with grateful Praise  While purrs the  Kitten  and the  LapDog  bays  While Winds shall breathe and rapid Rivers flow  And am'rous Sonnets sooth the Lovesick Beau  But let us

Here hang the batter'd Shields which Heroes wore  In Ages past at  Ilion  's fatal Shore  The massy Relicks not ten Beaux could raise  The gentle Warriours of these latter Days  To these dark Regions of eternal Night  The mighty Pow'rs of Love direct their Flight  Ambrosial Zephyrs all around them play  And gently fan th' unwholsome Fogs away  Soon as they enter'd all the swarthy Band  Drop their unfinish'd Labours from their Hand  The heav'nly Form they view'd with wond'ring Eyes  And in a silent Grin confest Surprize  At length elate exclaims the limping God  What drew my Fair one from her blest Abode  Why hast thou left the peaceful Realms above  Why to these dreary Mansions dost thou rove  Where foul Contagion hovers in the Air  And sultry Vapours blast the blooming Year  Name it whate'er it be O name thy Boon  Nor thou can'st ask nor I can grant too soon  Then thus began the beauteous Queen of Love  O thou that form'st the forked Bolts of  Jove  Whose Art can teach the stubborn Brass to yield  Point in the Spear or widen in the Shield  Thou that didst clad in Steel my  Aeneas  See the Eighth Book of the Aeneid Line  fav'rite Boy  That bravely led the poor Remains of  Troy  An equal Task demands thy nicest Care  Nor arm the Hero now but arm the Fair  I ask not Weapons such as wont to grace  The valiant Damsels  The  Amazons  of the  Scythian  Race  A little Target shape with curious Care  To shield the Finger in the Toils of War  The Gift to  Fannia  shall Relief impart  The first in Beauty as the first in Art  Wounded she pines nor dares again to wield  The Instrument of Blood without a Shield  This shall secure the Fair from future Pain  And bless for ever all the female Train  Then when some Nymph howe'er that Nymph be nam'd  For the nice Conduct of

Goddess turn'd aside her Face  And with Reluctance met the foul Embrace  Then from the dreary Cave they mount to Day  And to the  Baron  's House direct their Way  Lost in a pleasing Dream the Beau was laid  And thus the bright celestial Vision said  Cynthio  awake and seize thy  Fannia  's Charms  Take her for ever to thy faithful Arms  Her outward cur'd she feels an inward Pain  And Love impetuous glows in ev'ry Vein  Give her this Target made by  Vulcan  's Art  To guard her Finger from the Needle's Dart  Secur'd by this undaunted she may rear  And fearless shake the long tremendous Spear  So shall far distant Times admire her Name  And crown her Labours with eternal Fame  She said and left the Shield the Gift bestow'd  And with her Son pursu'd the heav'nly Road  But now the Morn shot forth a feeble Ray  And ting'd the Mountains with the Blush of Day  Uprose the joyful Baron straight he spies  The  Thimble  Shield and grasps the shining Prize  The Work divine with Wonder he

conscious Blushes glow  And her Heart flutter'd for her charming Beau  When lo he comes Love flashes from his Eyes  Unusual Raptures in her Bosom rise  Then to the Fair he gave the Gift bestow'd  The sacred Shield the Labour of a God  Joyful she view'd the Workmanship around  Heal'd of her last and safe from future Wound  'Twas in that Hour the Beau his Passion prest  'Twas in that Hour the Fair

glad Tidings  c The  Games  of our Author which constitute a very entertaining if not necessary Part of the  Epic  Poem seem to be introduced much more judiciously than those of  Homer  or  Virgil  for notwithstanding the Customs of Antiquity which may be thought to warrant those Authors Sports surely of all Kinds more properly and naturally precede a  Wedding  than they succeed a  Funeral  Of the  Games  themselves more in their Place  Let the glad Tidings spread proclaim about  This Afternoon we hold a solemn Route  Summon the Belles the Damsels and the Dames  The Beaux and  Foplings  to the nuptial  Games  In yon Buffet be plac'd before their Eyes  Each Combat's due Reward and glitt'ring Prize  She said and  Fame  her loudest Trumpet blows  And in gay Clusters croud the Belles and

beautiful and apt ComparisonsIn these he seems to be excelled by none not even  Homer  himself at least our Author's are all  original  and not translated like  Virgil  's from his  Greek  Predecessor

quacking Race  Now undistinguish'd chatt'ring fills the Place  At length the Rage of Appetite allay'd  Thus to the Route began the lovely Maid  O ye whose Bosoms  c The following Particulars relating to the ensuing  Games  of our Author are observableFirst That they are exhibited by the Heroine of the Poem as those of  Homer  and  Virgil  are by their respective HeroesSecondly That they are of so inoffensive though interesting a Nature that  Ladies  and  Gentlemen  equally appear as Competitors for the several Prizes a Circumstance which renders them perfectly agreeable to the present System of the  Epopee  and gives them a manifest Advantage in Point of Variety and Novelty over the Sports of the antient PoetsThirdly That notwithstanding this Deviation from Antiquity the Author has taken Care to infuse the Spirit of  Homer  and  Virgil  even into these  genteel  or  gentle  Exercises as will appear from many Passages the most remarkable of which we will occasionally take Notice of  O ye whose Bosoms beat for Fame draw near  Beaux Belles Fops  Foplings  Chiefs and  Chieflings  hear  â€   And first they pourTo mighty  Jove c This is a polite Improvement of the following Libation in

Nature are really inseperable from such Exercises so there was a Necessity of painting this in the striking Colours of Poetry It had convey'd the very same Idea but yet would have been below the

Crimen habet quanto major qui peccat habetur  JUVEN  The SECOND EDITION CORRECTED  TO Sir JOHN PHILIPPS Bar  t    SIR  THOUGH I am happy in your Permission to shelter under your Name a Performance which stands in much Need of your Favour and Protection especially as it comes into the World with some Disadvantage yet I hope you will do me the Justice to believe me actuated by a nobler Principle than that of a Selfishness common to all Authors in my Choice of a Patron upon the present Occasion  For Sir the following Sheets are with a particular Propriety yours whether you are considered as a Person sincerely attached to the University of  Oxford  or affectionately interesting yourself in the Welfare of  PembrokeCollege  to the Regard and best Wishes of which Society you have a double Claim both as an Ornament and a Benefactor  The common Topics of Panegyric are obvious and I have here a fair and agreeable Opportunity of taking Notice of those many amiable Qualities which adorn you in public and private Life and for which you are so justly beloved and esteemed But my Inclination is corrected by a seasonable Thought that most Writers of the present Age  have in this Respect a considerable Advantage over me as it is much more easy to make a Character than to describe one  Besides it would be needless to enter into a Detail of those Praises which are already in the Mouth of every Wellwisher to his Country And therefore I will only indulge the Impulse of Gratitude which points to that Part of your Character which more immediately affects me your Goodnature and Condescension to which I am indebted for the Honour of your Acquaintance and Friendship and for your favourable Acceptance of the following Poem  Give me Leave to assure you Sir that I am principally anxious for the Reputation of this Tragedy from an earnest Desire of transmitting to Posterity a Monument of the Regard and Veneration I have for the Person and Character of Sir JOHN PHILIPPS I am  SIR  Your much obliged And most humble Servant WILLIAM HAWKINS  PEMBROKECOLLEGE OXON  March    ADVERTISEMENT  THE most  material  Objection to this Tragedy made by Mr  Garrick  was that it is rather a  Poem  than a  Play  A  consolatory  Octjection at least as it is founded only in the Author's acknowleged Transgression of the  mechanical  Laws of the  Drama  But however reasonable the Objection might be to the  Representation  of this Tragedy upon the  Stage  it was by no Means thought a sufficient one to its  original  Publication nor consequently 'tis presumed will be esteemed such against its having a Place in the  present  CollectionThose who are offended at the Liberties taken in it may if they please call it an  Historical Play  and then all Exceptions of this Nature vanish of CourseAfter all the Objection will perhaps have  less  Weight with the candid and judicious Reader when he has favoured with his Perusal the  Essay  on the  Antient and Modern Drama  though he is not to look upon that  Essay  as written with a View to the Defence of  this particular  Play or to consider  this Advertisement  as any Thing like a Declaration of the  Author's Right  of Exemption from

CLIFFORD  Earl of  LEICESTER  Earl of  WINCHESTER  Earl of  SURRY  WOMEN  Queen  ELINOR  ROSAMOND  HARRIANA  Guards and Attendants  SCENE  in and near  CANTERBURY  HENRY AND ROSAMOND  ACT I SCENE I  Enter the Earl of  LEICESTER  LEICESTER  IF there is that some call Eternal Justice  Let not the coward Thought perplex my Soul  My Bosom entertains two lordly Guests  Strongplum'd Ambition and Hellgender'd Lust  The Voice of Conscience 'gainst their wild Domain  Is but a Whisper to the Whirlwind's Blast  Henry Plantagenet  has crost my Hopes  I stand the Outcast of his Peevishness  And disappointed Rival of his Love  But I have deeply laid my Plan of Vengeance  I have been long young  Harry's  Oracle  His shallow Friends walk in my Leadingstrings  If Fate give him the Crown I'll bear the Rule  And thro' the Gate of Pow'r shall find Access  To Love and  Rosamond  But see Lord  Surry  Enter Earl of  Surry  Sur  My Lord of  Leicester  hast thou seen the Prince  Leic  No What of him  Sur  O he is seeking thee  Thou hast fast wedg'd thyself within his Heart  He calls thee valiant faithful just and good  He now demeans himself as we could wish  Talks of high Fame and hardy Feats of Arms  Thou hast inspir'd his Soul He swears the Crown  Whose Glories fade on  Henry  's wither'd Head  Would better flourish on his youthful Brow  In troth he is a mettled Youth my Lord  And Nature meant him well  Leic  Ay or how else  Could we have taught him his own Worth or ours  Or hope to raise our Honours from the Dust  Faint Hearts will call this Treason but my Lord  'Tis injur'd Merit's Cause and we will work  To turn the Current of our lowebb'd Fortunes  Into a fuller Channel But he comes  And I have joyful Tidings for his Ear  Enter Prince  Henry  and Earl of  Winchester  P  Hen  Well our good Friend and trusty Councellor  What from our Uncle  Scotland  Leic  This my Liege  In princely Terms he greets your Royal Highness  And well approves th' Alliance you have offer'd  But Words so please your Grace in forc'd Extent  Are but the Texture of fine Rhetoric  Plain Action is Sincerity's best Proof  He has encamp'd his Troops on  English  Ground  A peerless Force of twenty thousand strong  The Earl of  Chester  with your Father's Powers  Is in full March to meet him  P  Hen  Say my Lord  On what Pretence makes he this Armament  For we must wait the Issue of a Battle  Before we can avow ourself his Friend  Leic  His Claim's distinct from yours He does demand  Full Restitution of the frontier Towns  Your Father wrested from him in the Wars  And thus he seems no Party in our Cause  While we as Time shall serve may back his Quarrel  P  Hen  Why these are noble Tidings and befit  Our Royal Purpose This looks well my Lords  I will no longer bend me to the Brow  Of this old King my Father  Leicester Surry  Winchester  Friends Companions of my Fortunes  Give me your Hands your Hearts and trust me Lords  We bravely shall outface these perilous Times  Assisted by your Loves  Sur  My hasty Will  Is on the Wing mocking Ability  And Zeal outstrips Performance  Win  And so in Honesty of Heart says  Winchester  P  Hen  Thanks to you both But my good Lord of  Leicester  Are these same  Scots  our newcontracted Friends  Such as our Honour may lean safe upon  Leic  Better ne'er mounted Glory's steep Ascent  Sir they are bold as the first Sons of Nature  Ere Pomp and Luxury debauch'd the World  Bred in a Land of Poverty and Want  They live by free uncultivated Virtue  Ease were unnatural to their Iron Hearts  For Labour is the Business of their Lives  And when they're summon'd forth to serve their Prince  Dreadful they march embody'd in the Field  As the fell Storm or Deathdispersing Bolt  That rushes on and levels all before it  P  Hen  'Tis good and henceforth will we mould our Person  Into the Attitude of Majesty  Winch  It fits your Highness well  P  Hen  Thou'st seen me  Leicester  in the Bloom of Youth  Amidst the Joys of a voluptuous Court  Where Folly spread her silken Net before me  There soft'ning Beauty breath'd the am'rous Sigh  There melting Music tun'd her Syren Voice  And the highflowing Bowl foam'd with rich Wines  Soliciting ev'n Abstinence to taste  Let me not turn my gallant Thought that Way  When Virtue's balanc'd on so nice a Poise  One Breath of Inclination turns the Scale  Farewel for ever Pleasure's nerveless Tribe  Welcome the manly Pomp of crimson War  The Heavenscaling Noise of charging Foes  The piercing Groans of Bravery laid in Dust  And all the Dangers all the Sweets of Glory  Leic  Spoke like a Candidate for this World's Empire  Old  Harry  's foremost Boast is only this  That he is Father to a Prince like you  P  Hen  Go to he's weak he's weak and peevish  And yet 'tis current Conversation here  That he hath well acquitted him in  France Leicester  To martial Chivalry  Sur  True it is my Liege  In open Field he'as twice o'erthrown their Powers  And now returns  Leic  Ay like a Fugitive  Rather than Conqueror the doting Hero  Comes whining like an Infant for his Toy  O he is worse than distaff'd  Hercules  Where is the Honour of your  Saxon  House  If Harlots make a Tool of Majesty  Fame shall record  Harry  succeeded  Rosamond  Not  Harry Harry  P  Hen  By the immortal Name  Of my great Ancestors it is too much  Leic  O give that noble Indignation Room  Have you not Friends and Justice on your Side  Did we not all swear Fealty to your Highness  Conven'd in full Assembly by your Father  Or was it but a Shew of Majesty  A solemn Farce of State for Boys to shout at  P  Hen  Hold thereFor ev'ry Word thy Love has utter'd  Rebukes my tardy SoulO 'tis most true  As spiritless and dulltemper'd as I seem  This Head has born fair  England  's Diadem  You all remember 'twas at  Winchester  In Presence of the States of the whole Realm  The Royal Grant was made when on this Brow  Rested th' Imperial Crown which should confer  High Dignity and Share of sov'reign Sway  It was the free Donation of our Father  Leic  Henry  has sure forgotten him of late  For then your Royal Highness may remember  He did discharge an Office that became him  P  Hen  Ay thou dost well remind me of it  Leicester  'Twas at the sumptuous Banquet then prepar'd  I sat inthron'd the foremost of the Feast  Lord of that glorious Day 'Twas then my Father  Stept forth obsequious like a VassalPrince  Tending my Kingly Board and sure he cry'd  No Monarch e'er was serv'd so honourably  I whisper'd in his Ear his Grace of  York  That born a Prince I thought me not much honour'd  By this same Ministry of that Duke's Son  My Father was no better  Leic  Nor is now  But in our foolish Fears Was that same Crown  You just now spoke of but a  Mayday  Garland  Bestow'd as on an Idiot in mere Pastime  Unnat'ral Insult By the Blood that's in you  If you have Hand or Heart or Sword revenge  Revenge yourself your Country and your Friends  Your Friends for you dishonour'd slighted scorn'd  Your Country soften'd by effeminate Rule  Yourself the stalking Shadow of a King  P  Hen  Enough my tow'ring Fancy grasps the Skies  Hence give the Word to Fate gird on my Sword  Thou faithful Guardian of my wav'ring Youth  I'll go where thou and Honour point the Way  Where are these trusty  Scots  Quick let us join them  I will unfold my Banner to the Sun  And pour my Vengeance on this ParentFoe  Leic  Well said but I must cool this burning Vein  Or this mad Youth will hurry us to Ruin  Aside  I meant not this I pray your Grace be calm  P  Hen  Yes as the Sea that quarrels with the Wind  Who is't can tame the hungry Panther's Rage  Glory has still an Appetite more keen  Harry  contends not for a vulgar Prize  It is a Crown Repeat it to the Heavens  With the big Mouth of War It is a Crown  O you should rush in Fury from my Presence  And boldly pluck it from the Tyrant's Brow  Leic  Your Highness knows our Hearts and Duty yours  But Zeal thus premature were worse than Treason  Our growing Cause is yet too young to weather  This most tempestuous Time If Fortune bless  Our good Allies with Victory the Crown  Is yours by Cov'nant and your Right proclaim'd  By  Scotland  's King Till when lie we in secret  Like the unseen insinuating Flame  That creeps while it destroys Without this Caution  We are not safe an HourYour Father comes  And you're withdrawn from CourtHah how sounds that  P  Hen  As I love Honour I do fear him not  Leic  NoBut the less Suspicion's baleful Blast  Breathes on our Counsel it takes Root the deeper  P  Hen  What wouldst thou urge me to  Leic  Come come my Lord  You must yourself to Court to meet the King  And when he questions you of your Departure  Be you not too submissive nor too high  We can find Reasons plausible enough  Besides this Disaffectionasd'ye mark  The Treatment of your Motherthe foul Scandal  Of a licentious Palaceand the like  All Provocations gross And Sir of this  You shall be more advis'd anon  P  Hen  Say'st so  I thank thy PenetrationI was hot  But thou art wise and brave Our Craft shall prosper  The staunchest Hound of State that ever trac'd  The wily Doublings of Conspiracy  In such a Chace as this shall lose his Scent  And yelp his balk'd Sagacity in Air  Leic  May Fortune say Amen  P  Hen  My Lord of  Leicester  We must dispatch some fresh Instructions strait  For  Scotland  's King then for the Court away  We will pursue this Business come what may  Exeunt  SCENE II  Enter the Earl of  Salisbury  and Lord  Clifford  Sals  Yet hold good  Clifford  Clif  'Tis an old Man's Weakness  Was it not I that train'd him up to War  That taught his feeble Arm to grasp the Sword  And pointed out the Paths that lead to Glory  Was it for this he robb'd me of my Daughter  Sals  Forget it learn to scorn this Royal Robber  And be at Peace  Clif  It is impossible  Had he reduc'd me to the Beggar's Lot  Or stript me of the Honours of my Race  I could have smil'd at his Ingratitude  But to deprive me of my greatest Hopes  To steal away my choicest sweetest Flow'r  To tempt young Innocence with hellish Arts  'Tis more than Painit iswhat is it not  O 'tis too much for an old Man to bear  But canst assure me he returns so soon  Sals  Each Morn expects to see him crown'd with Laurels  And rich with Spoils Fortune still takes his Part  Wheree'er he marches palefac'd Terrour stalks  With Giant Strides and leads his Van of Battle  Clif  Let me do Justice to the Man has wrong'd me  My Lord of  Salisbury  from his Dawn of Youth  I've mark'd the Progress of an active Soul  Suited for warlike Deeds and brave Atchievements  But then his turb'lent Passions work so strong  His Character is ever an Extreme  A Hero or a Dotard in Excess  This Day with a deep Sense of Honour stung  A Convert to fair Virtue and the next  Born by fierce Appetite a Slave to Vice  Sals  His gen'rous Temper one Day may prevail  For Fate still throws Occasion in his Way  To put his noble Qualities to Proof  An unexpected Tempest from the North  Hangs low'ring o'er his Head and the young Prince  Who breathes a mighty and right Royal Spirit  Has with some noble Followers left the Court  Clif  He is ensnar'd by guileful  Leicester  's Art  The King thou know'st hath banish'd him his Presence  He meditates Revenge in all its Venom  And since arose the League 'twixt him and  Harry  Sals  Report has said this Lord on Terms of Honour  Woo'd your fair Daughter's Love  Clif  He did profess so  But much I fear me with a vile Design  For Satisfaction in which Point this Day  I've penn'd a Note in female Characters  As from my Daughter full of Brandishments  And cordial Invitations from her Love  If I surprise him at the Place assign'd  I shall detect his Baseness to his Face  Perhaps I but transcribe the Sentiments  Of her abandon'd HeartThat as it may  Sals  Think not too meanly of thy beauteous Daughter  Henry  'tis true engrosses all her Soul  Yet in her lonely solitary Hours  Sad she regrets her ruin'd Innocence  And mourns like the first Fair her fallen State  Clif  'Tis superficial Grief A barren Soil  Where Reformation never can take Root  O that an only Child should be a Curse  But let us hence the Thought encroaches on me  In Pity to myself I would divert it  Cousin this Way I have yet more to tell you  Of what my Soul is purpos'd tow'rd the King  Exeunt  SCENE III  Enter  Rosamond  and  Harriana  Har  This Coolness is untimely  Ros  Harriana  Th' unpleasing Thought will sometimes steal upon me  Great as they seem all these are dearbought Pleasures  Ev'n  Henry  's Love has cost me many a Pang  Peace is the glorious Privilege of Virtue  The harmless Country Maid that lives retir'd  Beneath the Covert of a homely Hut  And knows no View beyond her daily Bread  Has more Heart's Ease than I  Har  Prepost'rous Melancholy  Is not the World and its first Master yours  Nature thy Handmaid still supplies thy Wishes  Lavish of all her Stock as who should say  Thou shalt be happy  Ros  These are mean Suggestions  Know I ne'er sold my Virtue but to Love  The massy Store of the Wealthpregnant Earth  The Pomp and Eyeattracting Blaze of Courts  And all the gilded Baits of female Pride  Were Bribes my  Henry  's Love disdain'd to offer  Such as it is this Beauty won his Heart  How he won mineI know notbut he won it  For him I threw away my Innocence  And am the Scoff of every scornful Tongue  For him I've stain'd the noble Name of  Clifford  And pierc'd his aged Soul who gave me Being  For him e'en now my Heart with Transport beats  His Presence ever calms my troubled Breast  Stills each dull Thought and bids all Sorrow vanish  Har  Once more he comes victorious from the Field  O meet him with thy Love's sincerest Welcome  Ros  Yes he returns and Thought adieu for ever  Hence I defy that Tyrant of the Mind  My Love wants not a Plea  Henry  my Lord  Is great and gen'rous He's the Pride of Fame  And Fortune's Darling  Henry  lulls my Soul  In soft unfelt Captivity  Har  But harkâ–ª  Yon Trumpet's Voice proclaims him near at hand  Ros  O sweetest Music to the ravish'd Ear  Now ev'ry Thing begins to smile about me  Bright seems the Season as the newborn Spring  When ev'ry Flower put forth its freshest Fragrance  And infant Nature breath'd her Sweets around  Har  'Tis now thou risest to thy proper Self  Thy Charms are summon'd all thy Graces dawn  And ev'ry sparkling Beauty beams anew  But lo the Royal HeroI retire  Exit  Harriana  Enter King  Henry  K  Hen  Take me once more my Love into thy Arms  Thus let me clasp thee to my faithful Breast  Thus feed my Eyes upon thy glowing Beauties  And pour my Soul in Transports out before thee  What what is Fame or Victory to this  Adieu the Pomp and Pageantry of War  And Love resume the Empire of my Soul  Ros  Speak not my Eyes the Language of my Heart  Or shall I open my rich Hoard of Fondness  With all the soft Impertinence of Love  Why has my Lord so long been absent from me  Methinks I now receive thee in thy Tent  Dreadfully graceful from the Field of Blood  The manly Dew still reeking on thy Brow  O let me sooth my Hero to his Rest  Then kindly chide his Eagerness of Valour  And bid him sheath the Sword for Love of me  K  Hen  To thee I am devoted from this Hour  I'll give Mankind my loose superfluous Moments  But Love shall claim my more substantial Care  No petty Monarchs shall divide us more  France  and her King have felt the Wrath of  Harry  I flew on Wings of Victory to War  And like celestial Fire consum'd the Foe  Then halted in the mid Career of Glory  Conquest was Waste of Time Quick I return'd  And left the Business of the World unfinish'd  Ros  Forgive me  Henry  if I shed a Tear  A Tear at once of Pity and of Love  Gaze not thus fondly on me whilst I speak  It is a fatal Fondness and betrays thee  Possess'd of me art thou not lost to Honour  Where is the native Greatness of thy Soul  Thy gen'rous Thirst of everlasting Glory  O hadst thou never fix'd thine Eyes on me  Fame  on her brazen Tablet had display'd  Thy Royal Name and shewn it to the Stars  But I shall blot thy Memory for ever  K  Hen  Thy kind Concern is far too nice my Love  O  Rosamond  'tis but the Dream of Pride  Kings and their Subjects all are Nature's Children  And ermin'd Greatness on the Throne must own it  What is the Monarch more than other Men  His Appetites and Passions are the same  He hates revenges hopes and fears as they do  Or does he love O does he love like me  'Tis Glory 'tis Ambition to pursue  The heav'nly Fair and win her to his Wishes  Is it not Pride to hang upon thy Smile  Is it not Triumph to enfold thee thus  Art thou not All and is not this World Nothing  Ros  I could for ever listen to thy Voice  Whene'er thou speak'st Reason gives up the Cause  And Nature whispers what thou say'st is right  K  Hen  Be Love the Theme and I could talk for ever  Ros  Be Love the Theme I could for ever hear thee  K  Hen  O come my rural Goddess to my Arms  We'll lie upon the Flow'renamell'd Turf  The GarlandWreath shall be our Diadem  The Leafclad Bow'r our Canopy of State  Our Music the sweet Matin of the Lark  Then bless me with the Sunshine of thy Beauty  Till I forget my Royal Occupation  The Task of Greatness and the Toil of Power  And ev'ry Sense be full of Love and thee  Ros  How does thy Language charm my list'ning Ears  Yet must I dread this Indolence of Thought  The  Scotchmen  and their King are up in Arms  And if Report say true th' Invasion boasts  The Count'nance of your Son  K  Hen  Fear not my Love  My better Genius shall protect me still  Lend me thy LipDanger seems nothing now  O lead me to some peaceful close Retreat  Where all is calm and gentle as thy Breast  Let hostile War advance and Faction rage  I will not deign to give Mankind a Look  But safely rest within thy faithful Arms  So when the Pilgrim views the Storm arise  To the kind Shelter of some Grot he flies  And in that sweet Recess securely lies  Fearless he hears the dreadful Tempests roar  And the mad Oceans burst upon the Shore  The Heaven's in vain their flaming Terrours spread  And Thunders roll unheeded o'er his Head  Ex  ACT II SCENE I  Enter King  Henry  Duke of  Cornwall  and Attendants  King  Henry  COMES on our Brother  Scotland  Corn  Yes my Liege  He means to give my Lord of  Chester  Battle  K  Hen  Be't so Our Arms shall tame his Insolenceâ–ª  Where is our Son His uncurb'd Spirit of late  Gives Cause of some Suspicion Yet we hope  In humble wise he will confess the Fault  Of his abrupt Departure His new Friends  No Friends to me tho' Foes I fear them not  He must abandon and mean time we trust  A Look of our Displeasure shall controul  His heedless Folly and enforce his Duty  Corn  My Liege the Queen  K  Hen  I would have shunn'd her for she awes my Soul  I know her still a tender faithful Wife  Wrong'd as she is 'Tis my eternal Guilt  That love I cannot where I must esteem  She comesWhy starts my BreastI must assume  The cruel Port of Shameproof Villainy  Enter  Queen  Excuse my Freedom Madam if I ask  What Business has the Queen of  England  here  Queen  I come by Virtue of a better Title  Was  Elinor  no more than Queen of  England  She had not thus disturb'd you with her Presence  Am I nought else my Lord  K  Hen  Ay thou'rt my Wife  A Name that sounds offensive in my Ear  Queen  Why didst thou teach me 'twas a pleasing Name  Importing Peace and Harmony and Joy  You lov'd me when you made me what I am  And yet you lov'd me but to make me wretched  K  Hen  Love you have learnt and so all Women can  Didst thou e'er learn Obedience to a Husband  Queen  Can Malice say I ever fail'd in that  K  Hen  I pr'ythee then be dutiful and leave me  Queen  This Treatment is unkind Is that the Voice  That oft hath chid me for a Moment's Absence  Does it displease thee to behold me thus  Blame not the Weakness which yourself have caus'd  'Tis Grief's allow'd Prerogative to mourn  For sure it is no Crime to be distress'd  K  Hen  Away Thy Woman's Tears are lost on me  Why dost thou plead against Necessity  It was in Spite of me I lov'd thee once  And 'twas in Spite of me that I forsook thee  The Tie of Marriage is but personal  For Love alone's the Cement of the Heart  Yet grant that Contract good my Falshood voids it  I am no Husband Why art thou a Wife  The Bond is cancell'd Be free as I am  And take thy Heart from this ungrateful Object  Queen  Can the swift Current to its Spring recede  Or elemental Fire to Earth descend  Then only my fixt Thought can turn from thee  My Love tho'ill repaid shall shine a Pattern  Of Faith unmov'd without Reproach for ever  Henry  tho' cruel yet is  Henry  still  What was it but my Love that sent me hither  I thought I durst not comebut still I came  Unwelcom'd slighted Stranger as I am  K  Hen  I see thy Virtue and respect it  Elinor  But what is Virtue in the Eye of Love  Fate wrongly join'd us and mismatch'd our Hearts  Thou art fram'd tender innocent and good  For private Comfort and domestic Joy  My restless Spirit ranges uncontroul'd  As Fancy sways or lawless Passions guide  Queen  And yet thou canst be true tho' not to me  That restless Spirit  Rosamond  can rule  The Mistress of my Property thy Heart  Throw that detested Wanton from thy Breast  The Pride of Woman's Nature sues for this  O do not wrong me in the Face of Day  And I will bear thy Hate with Chearfulness  K  Hen  Thou rail'st by Licence of an injur'd Wife  Else let me me tell thee  Elinor  'twere Treason  What thou hast just now said  Queen  I ask your Pardon  I had forgot how dearly  Henry  loves her  And 'tis my Duty to promote his Joy  Nor justly can I hate ev'n her my Rival  Woman is frail and  Henry  more than Man  Be happy then blest Pair while I'm undone  A jealous Wife no more shall spoil your Loves  I will not taint your Peace with one Upbraiding  But lay me down without a Groan and die  K  Hen  This Tenderness reproaches me yet more  Than all the just Invectives thou couldst offer  O live to scorn the Man has wrong'd thee thus  Provoke I not thy utmost Enmity  Qu  Thou canst provoke my Sorrows not my Hate  K  Hen  Have I not giv'n thee Cause Be but my Foe  I shall enjoy the Sharpness of thy Malice  But Goodness undeserv'd unask'd torments me  Love Honour Pity tear my lab'ring Soul  Aside  Queen  Life had been happy with theeBut 'tis past  And I submitLive and be happy thou  K  Hen  By Heav'n this moves my Stubborness of Temper  And  Rosamond  and  Elinor  distract me  Must I then ruin one whom Laws divine  And my free Choice decreed mine own for ever  And cooly mark her close her Eyes in Death  Or can I leave the gentle  Rosamond  That tender Prime of Youth that Spring of Beauty  First won by Promise of eternal Love  Painful Extreme of Madness either Way  For either Way I'm doom'd to be a Villain  Queen  Seek not Excuses for thy broken Vows  I freely give those sacred Pledges back  Nor shall I e'er ascribe the Pangs I suffer  To  Henry  's Crime but Heav'n's afflicting Hand  I know thee great and noble still by Nature  Thou wilt hereafter reverence my Name  And praise the Woman whom thou could'st not love  K  Hen  O Heart Heart Heart why art thou not my own  Hadst thou attack'd me like a Fiend from Hell  Arm'd with keen Malice and severest Wrath  I had not shun'd the Conflict But as now  Thou shinest Angellike and allforgiving  Thou dost perforce convict my guilty Soul  And sink my Thoughts in black Despair for ever  O  Elinor  my QueenBut soft some News  Enter  Guard  Guard  My Liege the young Prince  Henry  waits without  And asks Admission to your Majesty  K  Hen  He comes in proper Time Let him advance  Enter Prince  Henry  Well thou young ManWith what a lordly Look  Thou mak'st ApproachDost thou not know me  Harry  P  Hen  Yes Sir you are my Father and my King  Names sacred both But still more sacred those  Of Faith and Honour these are what enroll  The Monarch's Name in Glory's noble List  And stamp substantial Royalty upon him  Th' imperial Robe the brightdeck'd Diadem  The lifted Brow the worldcommanding Nod  Ay and the loudtongu'd Voice of Acclamation  That bears up frail Mortality to Heav'n  These all are Majesty's Appendages  The Dress but not the Substance that disgrace  The Undeserver and but lift him high  To a Preeminence of splendid Shame  K  Hen  What art thou come to preach to us thou Boy  Are these th' obsequious Terms of filial Duty  But mark I henceforth warn thee to Obedience  And therefore satisfy our Royal Pleasure  Why thou didst leave the Court  P  Hen  That's a plain Question  My Mother could have answer'd  K  Hen  Hah our Queen  Thou seem'st surpris'd Is that a Face of Guilt  Speak speak for my shock'd Soul has form'd a Thought  Too black for Utt'rance  Queen  By my Hopes of Heav'n  I only know that I am innocent  P  Hen  I know no more than that and that's enough  Shall I beseech awhile your Royal Ear  To give me patient Audience  K  Hen  Well I'll hear thee  P  Hen  Did  Henry  leave the Court Not so my Liege  For  Henry  left a Brothel not a Court  Loose Riot and Intemperance dwelt there  Softseated Indolence and female Foppery  And pamper'd Jollity with fullblown Cheeks  Keeping high Festival and Jubilee  Was it for me to trust my Spring of Youth  That takes Impression like the yielding Wax  With such licentious Characters as these  Was it for me to sink in Luxury  To see a dimpled Harlot's wanton Reign  While banish'd from your House your Board your Bed  The best of Women languish'd Time away  At once a Widow and at once a Wife  I saw her Griefs I heard her just Complaints  I left by her Advice th' unhallow'd Roof  Lest I should seem to abet the Injury  And triumph o'er the Woes of her that bore me  K  Hen  Woman has not her Match on this Side Hell  Fool to believe a scorn'd abandon'd Wife  Less subtle or malicious than the Devil  Is this the praying dying  Elinor  Curse on thy fawning Honeysteep'd Deceit  What dost Thou practise with my secret Foes  In dev'lish League Dost Thou foment Rebellion  Say Woman dost thou Hah  Queen  What shall I say  Wilt thou thou rash hardhearted Youth undo me  Revoke the impious Slander of thy Tongue  And save thy Mother's Name from foul Dishonour  K  Hen  It is too lateI see confed'rate Mischief  This stripling Traytor has betray'd thy Counsel  Thee I had long since hated now despise  For you our sometime Sonbut I disdain thee  High Majesty is fenc'd with Adamant  Proof against Treason's Forceher fiercest Darts  Recoil and mock the feeble Strength that threw them  The Storm but breathes against the deepbas'd Tow'r  And vainly beats the Surge the solid Shore  Queen  Will it avail me to appeal to Heav'n  O may its choicest Stores of Wrath consume me  If e'er in Word or Thought I urg'd this Variance  He has abus'd thee with a wellfeign'd Tale  Screening some dreadful Purpose  K  Hen  Peace I say  You've fool'd me once and would you make me mad  Hah who shall tame me then  Queen  O my Son  The Pain thou gav'st me once was Ease to this  Why was thy Birthday hail'd with general Joy  Why did I bless the Sun that saw thee first  Why did I fondly rear thy feeble Age  Is thy Heart Flint O yet unweave thy Craft  Ere the sad Scheme be ratify'd above  And Fate has sign'd the Warrant  P  Hen  Let not these Fearindited Words deceive  The King while on my Knee I call to witness  The guardian Pow'rs that shield the Lives of Princes  That not in pers'nal Pique or private Grudge  Or Peevishness of Appetite restrain'd  Or the wild Policy of high Ambition  I sought this Breach but in an honest View  Of Duty to a Mother's just Request  And Hope to reconcile you to her Love  K  Hen  Thou ly'st as well as sheYou both meant more  P  Hen  Abuse fairspoken Honour and e'en Love  Becomes a Malecontent  K  Hen  Damn'd Hypocrites  Ye Homebred Plagues ye vile intestine Mischiefs  O had Rebellion bellow'd in the Field  And boldly challeng'd forth the Lord's Anointed  I could have calmly met its hottest Battle  But to reflect on unsuspected Treason  Most unsuspected as unnatural  Spreading its Poison ev'n within my Walls  Insulting in the sacred Name of Justice  Or stabbing with the smiling Look of Love  This grinds my ThoughtNow let Confusion reign  All Order and Relation be dissolv'd  And thou O Nature turn aside thy Face  Crimson'd with BlushesAll my firm Resolves  Are brittle now and Patience turns a Fury  Who's there Our Loving Wife and Loyal Son  Queen  Thy loving Wife but most disloyal Son  To me and thee Let me appeal my Lord  To the fair Judgment of your former Love  Did I not ever make your Will my Law  Was I deceitful treach'rous artful then  'Tis true my Wrongs are great but sure no Wrongs  Can alter Nature or invert the Mind  My Wrongs call for Revenge but sure a Queen  Could well revenge a nobler Way than this  O take my All my Liberty my Life  But leave me leave me my good Name untainted  K  Hen  Woman no more Have I not heard thy Son  Queen  He is no Son of mine  P  Hen  What would the Queen  So poorly yield her wellcontested Right  I know thy Cause and know my Duty better  Queen  Take heed ere yet an injur'd Mother's Curse  Fix on thy Bloom of Youth  P  Hen  Her Grief distracts her  Yet let me quit my Honour to the King  Wherein is my Complaint unwarrantable  Is it Rebellion Sir to sue for Justice  Which the poor Country Peasant if he lose  His Scrap of precious Property demands  Is this deny'd your Son Be the King sure  I know my Right and knowing dare maintain it  K  Hen  Thou hast no Right to move to speak to breathe  But with our Royal Pleasure Cease thou Fool  To parly with our high Authority  Thy trait'rous Friends have poison'd thy young Ear  Harry  I know them well But mark I charge thee  Forsake for ever all that Vermin Tribe  Or know their rotten Counsels will undo thee  P  Hen  Forsake my Friends Hear me allconscious Heav'n  While I renounce the base unmanly Thought  Forbid it Justice and forbid it Honour  Not one of them but lives in my best Love  Dear as the vital Stream that warms my Heart  Great are their Virtues and their Persons sacred  Let the whole World be told my Life protects them  And here I swear not all the Pow'rs combin'd  Of Earth or Hell shall drive me from this Purpose  K  Hen  Hah Didst thou ever see thy King in Wrath  If my large Weight of Vengeance fall upon thee  'Twill crush thee like an Insect into Dust  What am I brav'd by thee Shall  Henry  walk  Within the narrow Sphere of thy Prescription  Shall He whose stretch of ample Sway enfolds  The Nations round be tutor'd by a Boy  Be wise in Time and know young Counsellor  Our Wisdom pities thy raw Youth but learn  More low Demeanour or thou'lt fire my Blood  And damn thyself for ever  P  Hen  Words are Wind  Still noisy but not hurtful 'Tis that Blood  That Blood of thine that sparkles in my Veins  Forbids Capitulation Could I brook  Terms of high Challenge I were not your Offspring  Shall I be frighted when an old Man storms  Or fear a peevish Father in my Foe  Let Majesty shine forth in all its Pow'r  I dare unmov'd behold its fiercest Blaze  And like an Eagle face this burning Sun  So take thy unregarded Threatnings back  K  Hen  Still so untam'd young ManWhat Hoa our Guard  Enter Guard  P  Hen  Stand off ye Ministers of Tyranny  Who dares with impious Hand to touch our Person  I spurn to Hell's black CentreYe vile Slaves  Be motionless at our supreme Command  See ye not sacred Majesty about us  Sir we well know our sov'reign Dignity  When thus infring'dThe Crown your Grant bestow'd  With our best Force we will till Death defend  K  Hen  It is enoughHence from our Sight for ever  P  Hen  A last Farewel to Duty You're obey'd  And know if ever more I greet your Ear  'Twill be with Thunder and the Voice of War  Exit  Prince  K  Hen  Impetuous in his Folly let him go  This Notice has diminish'd Majesty  See you this Night arrest the Earl of  Leicester  To the Guard  I know him well the Pillar of the Faction  Our Queen still herein TearsShe's innocent  Ay and the Devil's not blackAway false Woman  Follow for Shame this Hero of thy own  Or curse thy disappointed Fraud at Home  O you have vext my HeartBut  Rosamond  With Love shall heal itTo her Arms I fly  What do I gall thee with that envy'd Name  Thank Heaven my utmost Hate is Justice now  So  Elinor  farewel rave and despair  Then die and be thy Name forgot for ever  Exeunt  King c  Manet  Queen  Queen  And shall I then expostulate with Heav'n  Impious and vain No rather let me die  Perish for him for whom alone I liv'd  And selfacquitted leave the World in Peace  The watchful Eye of Providence that sees  Thro' Night's most sable Shade and well discerns  Each dark Intrigue each Crevice of the Heart  Shall one Day vindicate my Innocence  And crown my injur'd Love with Praise immortal  Then when I'm laid in Dust my cruel Lord  O'er my cold Grave shall shed a pitying Tear  And own I well deserv'd a happier Fate  Exit  SCENE II  Enter King  Henry  and  Rosamond  Ros  And will you go  K  Hen  But for this Night my Fair  Ros  This Night How many Hours are in this Night  How many Minutes in each tedious Hour  Methinks I dare not trust thee from my Arms  K  Hen  Thou know'st my Love the solemn Vow I made  I must do Penance at the sacred Shrine  Of  Becket  ere I close mine Eyes in Sleep  The Holy Father of the Church injoin'd it  If I refuse I draw upon mine Head  Curses Anathemas and Execrations  And all th' Artillery of angry Priesthood  This once perform'd I am thy own for ever  Ros  O let my Lord excuse my selfish Fears  For what is  Henry  's Safety but my own  K  Hen  Why we shall live to triumph over both  This Trait'ress Queen and fierce hotheaded Son  But I forget them while I view thy Beauty  Sole Comfort adequate to kingly Care  The soothing Freshness of the vernal Breeze  The lulling Notes of dying Harmony  The rapt'rous Calm of good Mens golden Dreams  Bring not such balmy Quiet to the Soul  As thy Sensestealing Softness  Ros  Can my Love  Stray but a Moment ev'n in Thought from thee  Joy of my Life and Sov'reign of my Wishes  Such Sighs as these within your Bosom heav'd  Such lively Fondness sparkled in your Eyes  Such tuneful Accents trembled on your Tongue  When first transported at my Feet you sigh'd  My Royal Captive and there swore you lov'd  K  Hen  Thy Charms had caught me but som  Days before  Let me look back on that delightful Hour  'Twas in an Ev'ning of the blooming  May  The Nymphs and Swains in rural Garb attir'd  To the Pipe's woodland Strain upon the Lawn  In mirthful Freedom join'd the sprightly Dance  You shone superiour 'midst the Virgin Throng  Fairest among the Fair Auspicious Fortune  Had led my Steps that Way I came I saw  And seeing lov'd  Ros  Love like a watchful Spy surpris'd my Heart  Wellfitted to receive the soft Impression  Thy graceful Presence drew my wond'ring Eyes  I sigh'd but knew not 'twas a Sigh of Love  I wept but knew not that I wept for thee  Till Nature by Degrees inform'd my Heart  And something told me I was made for you  K  Hen  For me for me alone those heav'nly Charms  Had been dishonour'd by inferiour Love  Nature design'd thee for the noblest Conquest  And giving thee such Excellence of Beauty  Wisely contriv'd a Blessing for a Monarch  Ros  And of all Monarchs only for my  Henry  Who shines distinguish'd 'midst a Tribe of Kings  As they among the vulgar Herd  K  Hen  Enough  Be it my Glory to deserve thy Sweetness  Ros  Be it my Glory to repay thy Truth  K  Hen  How strong the Tie which Love himself has made  One dear Embrace and for this Night adieu  Ros  I grudge ev'n Saints a Moment of thy Time  How shall I sigh and languish in thy Absence  How shall I spring to hail thy safe Return  With a fond Heart full fraught with Love and Joy  So the poor Bird sits pensive in her Nest  While tender Fears disturb her anxious Breast  At length she kens her Mate with piercing Eye  On rapid Pinions skim along the Sky  With welcome Notes she chears the vocal Grove  And fondly chirps and bills with most officious Love  Exeunt  ACT III SCENE I  Enter Lord  Clifford  in Disguise  CLIFFORD  HENRY must pass this Way for  Becket  's Tomb  While thus attir'd like a poor begging Friar  I shall escape his Knowlege I must win  His Ears to my Discourse while I relate  The piteous Story of my Sufferings  And circumstantially describe my Woes  In Terms so clear that the Similitude  Himself portraiting strongly to himself  Shall strike upon his Soul With a dim Eye  Personal Guilt is view'd an Atom Spot  Sharpsighted Censure sees in other Men  What tho' our barren Conf'rence have no Issue  At least I shall unload my burthen'd Heart  And probe his wounded Conscience to the Quick  But holdHe comes  Enter King  Henry  K  Hen  'Tis muchWhat to submit  To painful Chastisement and on the Flint  Wear out the slowpac'd NightBe we content  'Tis to appease our holy Mother Church  I like this Cloister's awful Solitude  It seems the Dwellingplace of Meditation  Hah who comes tow'rds us with so sad an Aspect  Sure he's the youngest Son of Misery  Lo here a Beggar and a King Wide Contrast  Yet pass one Moment all Distinctions vanish  And Majesty incorporates with Dust  Let Pride go weep It may amuse my Thought  To hide the King and commune with this Fellow  What hoa Friend who are you  Cliff  Why who art thou  That dost not know  Lorenzo  the poor Friar  K  Hen  I'm come to pay Devotion to  Saint Thomas  And am a Stranger here  Clif  I crave your Pardon  Thou seem'st of noble Blood  K  Hen  Well hast thou said  For such I am  Cliff  Then Sir you know King  Henry  K  Hen  Exceeding well I oft attend his Court  But why's thy Tongue familiar with that Name  Clif  Because I take a Pride to let thee know  That wretched as I am this Arm has serv'd him  K  Hen  If well I trust that Service was repaid  Clif  As Avarice could wish Ev'n to this Day  He is the Idol of my Memory  I serv'd him in his early Prime of Glory  His Soldiers lov'd him all for all believ'd him  The best of Kings his Country's Friend and Father  O he was noble gen'rous brave and just  Pow'rful but to protect and not oppress  Fear'd and renown'd abroad and lov'd at home  K  Hen  Praise undeserv'd is Satire's bitt'rest Gall  Aside  In Faith thou hast describ'd his Highness well  Methinks there is right Honesty about thee  Thy talk exceeds the Promise of that Habit  Clif  Sir I was once no Stranger to good Fortune  But wherefore do I hold this Talk Farewel  K  Hen  Yet stay for thou hast mov'd my Soulâ–ª to learn  The Story of thy LifeWhence and what art thou  Why is thy Look thus sad and discontented  Does not Religion's Garb sit easy on thee  Say wherefore didst thou leave the Royal Camp  To live immur'd within these holy Walls  Yet now unmindful of thy Dedication  Dost nauseate the Cup of Poverty  Thyself hast sworn to drink  Clif  Thou dost not know  What 'tis to be distress'dI could display  A Scene so mournful to thy startled Ear  Thy Wonder should be swallow'd up in Pity  Canst thou lend Patience to an old Man's Prattle  K  Hen  I will  Clif  Know then the holy Brotherhood  Combat with more in this religious Warfare  Than Downreposing Luxury e'er dreamt of  We're Men but yet no Members of Mankind  This rev'rend Mansion is to us our World  Yon melancholy Cells thou seest our Home  There ev'ry Night in pensive Meditation  We watch the Lamp's dull Gleam and when we sleep  'Tis but what Nature steals from rigid Duty  Till the shrill Cock the Usher of the Morn  Awakes us to the Discipline of Day  Our homely Meals are low and regular  And while we stay the Rage of Appetite  We starve the dainty Palate To be brief  Wealth Business Pleasure Honour we renounce  And all of us are Wretches by Engagement  'Tis thus we struggle with Mortality  Rather than live What think you of our State  K  Hen  'Tis all that Man can do tow'rds earning Heav'n  It is Extremity of Wretchedness  But yet  Clif  Ha ha ha  K  Hen  What can provoke thy Mirth  Clif  Your Ignorance  For in this Light thou seest me to Advantage  All this is Happiness to what I suffer  Was this the mighty Sum of all my Sorrow  These Eyes should start in Transport from their Orbs  And my old Heartstrings crack with rising Joy  K  Hen  Thy Fortune has been merciless indeed  If this sad Place be Sorrow's Sanctuary  Clif  What's this Sir to the Poignancy of Woe  To inward Grief to vital Agony  And the keen Pang that gnaws upon the Heart  Poor tho' he is the Man whose Mind's at Ease  Beneath the Strawbuilt Roof enjoys his Sleep  At pinching Hunger's Importunity  Epicurelike devours his savoury Fragment  And joyous as the brainsick Reveller  Quaffs down the unadulterated Stream  But O how bitter is the scanty Morsel  That feeding Life but nourishes Despair  K  Hen  How loudly does the Voice of Grief demand  The social Tear O what is mortal Man  That may be brought thus low 'Twill glad my Soul  To make this Fellow happy  Aside  Clif  Stranger I thank thy Tears they shew thee noble  Pity flows always from the manly Heart  Have you a Daughter Sir  K  Hen  Say why that Question  Clif  O I had one so fair so innocent  Excuse my Tears  K  Hen  Thou seem'st to speak of her  In pleasing TermsSo fair so innocent  Clif  O she was once the Treasure of my Soul  Bright as the Morning's freshexpanded Beam  And spotless as the whiterob'd Angels are  Whene'er I taught her Honour's sacred Law  Her still Attention and obsequious Look  Seem'd the Certificates of inborn Virtue  Sometimes I've trac'd her Mother in her Face  Pleas'd to recall the Springtide of my Days  And travel o'er Youth's chearful Road again  For her I left the Business of the Field  Wellpleas'd I toil'd a rural Life away  And joyful saw my golden Harvests rise  But Plenty Peace and Comfort are no more  Her coward Virtue stoop'd to brutal Love  I could not bear the Shame I left my House  The Fugitive of Choice and not of Fortune  Sick of this worthless World at length I sought  This Cloister of religious Poverty  And here I mean to lay down Life and Sorrow  K  Hen  Thy Loftiness of Soul amazes me  Who was the Villain that abus'd thy Daughter  Perdition on his Head  Clif  That cuts me deep  My most invet'rate Foe had spar'd my Fame  But him that ruin'd it I call'd my Friend  He was the Man I honour'd from my Soul  I thought him honest gentle just and true  But found him cruel wicked false and base  K  Hen  What means my Heart Thou hadst a Daughter  Clifford  Aside  Clif  My hospitable Doors had just receiv'd him  A welcome Guest a smiling Murderer  While Confidence in his superiour Worth  Made the curst Work of my Undoing easy  K  Hen  The Dagger's Point the Scorpion's deadly bite  Wound not like these Soulpenetrating Words  I'm like this very Villain  Aside  Clif  You're disturb'd Sir  K  Hen  No not at all Proceed you in your Tale  Clif  To this Ingratitude he added more  I had been Guardian to his tender Youth  And for I found a warlike Spirit in him  Train'd him to hard Fatigues and manly Toil  We serv'd together in the Wars abroad  And I was still his Pattern in the Battle  Fame has since then spoke loudly in his Praise  But be he e'er so great I made him so  K  Hen  I stand condemn'dit isit cannot be  Sure he's a Messenger from angry Heav'n  Sent to arraign my Soul  Aside  Clif  You are not well Sir  K  Hen  A sudden Qualm has seiz'd me But 'twill off  'Tis a familiar MaladyAccept  These AlmsI must be goneAgain Tomorrow  Clif  But one Word more something remains untold  He further ow'd a nearer Obligation  To my Heart's Love For once in Heat of Fight  When he had broke his Sword the desp'rate Foe  With his broad Falchion aiming at his Head  Had levell'd him to Earth when I rush'd in  And disappointed Fate This wounded Breast  Bears yet the honest Record of that Service  Please you look here  K  Hen  Give me more Air Away  Exit  Clif  He has it deep I mark'd his startled Conscience  I drove the keen reproach into his Heart  He shook like a raw Novice in his Guilt  May Heav'n indent th' Impression on his Soul  This is a busy Ev'ning at this Hour  And near this Place my Letter did appoint  The Earl of  Leicester  to an Interview  I am no more a Beggar in Disguise  But here an open and avenging Foe  Exit  SCENE II  Enter  Queen  and Duke of  Cornwall  Queen  Thou hast well flatter'd my desponding Soul  That had forgot to hope O Pain of Doubt  Next to Despair  Corn  Let not the  Queen  distrust  These Means of good Success I've wish'd long since  T' assist thy Exigence and but just now  Consulted sev'rally the Royal Guard  That keep the Watch Tonight at her Apartment  I've won them to your Int'rest on Condition  No Wrong be offer'd to the Fairone's Person  At Midnight's silent Hour nought will obstruct  The fatal Visitation  Queen  My good Lord  I thank thy Friendship by my Hopes of Peace  The Person of my Rival shall be sacred  'Twill pain me to dissemble Cruelty  For I have all the Softness of my Sex  But no Resentment jealous Rage and Malice  That wont t' inflame the Breast of injur'd Woman  Corn  Hard by yon Hill where now the Lamp of Day  Seaward descends there stands a fam'd old Convent  Ne'er had Religion a more awful House  A Stream slowgliding winds about its Borders  Upon whose Banks stand a long Range of Oaks  That cast a wide Solemnity of Shade  O'er the high Walls the creeping Ivy climbs  And in its higharch'd Vaults no Sounds are heard  But whistling Winds and deepton'd Falls of Water  Remorse and Horror dwell for ever there  It is the Seat of Penitence and Sorrow  Thither be  Rosamond  this Night convey'd  And for the rest trust Heav'n  Queen  This may secure  My wretched Rival but the  King  my Lord  How shall I face his Anger For I know  Alas I do not know how much he loves her  Corn  Believe me ev'ry Circumstance shall end  In ample Illustration of thy Virtue  My Lord of  Chester  has o'erthrown the  Scots  So shall you soon stand clear of all Suspicion  Of aiding jointly with your Son the War  And slander'd Innocence again shall triumph  Queen  Good Omens dwell upon thy pleasing Words  But let us hence I must prepare my Heart  For this Night's Enterprize  SCENE III  Enter Lord  Leicester  with a Letter  Leic  Fortune thou dost exceed thy Vot'ry's Hope  Fate does my Work herself and spares my Pains  How had my Brain been toiling for this Hour  She wills me meet her

Clifford  's Self  Unlucky Stars But Statesman to thy Work  Enter Lord  Clifford  Clif  Good Even to my Lord You seem'd in Thought  Leic  In Faith my good Lord  Clifford  so I was  I have some certain Smatch of Poesy  And walking forth to taste the Ev'ning's Freshness  My Wit 'gan to be somewhat humoursome  I fear your Lordship has quite marr'd my Sonnet  Clif  What does the Paper you just folded up  Contain the Substance  Leic  A short Sketch my Lord  My Muse in Miniature a very Trifle  Clif  Say  Leicester  is't a Time to trifle now  Peace to thy Heart I think the Season's sickly  Leic  Why so do I and trust me noble  Clifford  'Tis but to cheat away my Melancholy  I sometimes condescend to be a Fool  Clif  O I could be a Fool a very Wretch  Could rank me with the common savage Crew  Turn Hireling drudging Slave and carry Burdens  If I could purchase with this Sum of Care  My wonted Peace of Mind Sure I'm so wretched  Fate fix'd me for its Masterpiece of Malice  Leic  Great are thy Wrongs indeed Yet we all suffer  'Tis epidemical this State Disorder  And who can cure the Fever but ourselves  We'll be our own Physicians my good Lord  And let out this hot Blood  Clif  I'm not so desp'rate in my Purposes  Headstrong Impatience swells beyond its Charter  And I must tell thee I've that Sense of Honour  That I could bear a Thousand gross Affronts  That stink ev'n to the Sun before the Guile  Of artful Villainy that lurks unseen  And ruins while it smiles  Leic  Ev'n so good  Clifford  Sure a clandestine Traitor is the vilest  The Devil's most odious Quality is Cunning  Let us not think your Lordship has such Foes  Mean time make use of me and my Soul's Friendship  Clif  Hah  Leicester  dost thou know what Friendship is  'Tis not the fawning Cringe the study'd Smile  The oilsmooth Speech big Word or solemn Vow  It is a sacred Ray of heav'nly Love  Like that rejoicing in the Good of others  It scorns the narrow Bounds of Selfishness  And knows no Bliss sincere but social Joy  Simple and plain it shines in naked Truth  And opens all the Sluices of the Heart  Leic  What means all this  Clif  I know no double Meaning  Leic  I thought I had been known and try'd enough  Not to be troubled with a pedant Lecture  Let me my Lord tell you another Truth  Distrust is Friendship's Canker  Clif  Then I fear me  Our Friendship waxes tow'rd a Dissolution  Because sometimes Distrust is kin to Prudence  Leic  That as your Lordship thinks For my own Part  I know the Man will thank me for my Service  And so Goodnight  Clif  Nay hold you go not yet  For I have that to say will make your Heart sick  Before we part  Leic  What dost thou mean old Man  Thee and thy vile Suggestion I defy  Clif  Then I demand in Honour's sacred Name  As Thou would'st here make good thy Honesty  That thou unfold the Purport of that Paper  The Sonnet that thou talk'dst of  Leic  Is my Quality  Sunk on a sudden to so low an Ebb  That I must answer every Fool's Demand  Which he may make because his Humour's testy  Clif  Then my Demand is fruitless is it not  Leic  Ay and injurious too Thy Age protects thee  Else on this Side I wear an Advocate  This faithful Sword to guard its Master's Honour  And vindicate his Name from foulmouth'd Slander  Clif  Come thy Hypocrisy's a threadbare Cloak  You've worn it long my Lord and now 'tis seen through  If thy Complexion were as black as Hell  I'd conjure up a Blush into thy Cheeks  Know then I sent that Scroll  Leic  Know then I care not  Clif  O thou vile Spoiler  Wherein or when had I offended thee  That thou couldst calmly mean me so much Wrong  Lost as she is to  Henry  's damn'd Inchantments  My Daughter's not a gen'ral Prostitute  Or say she was the Plaything of Mankind  My Friend would spurn at her but pity me  Leic  Thee Dotard and whatever else presumes  To thwart my Will I scorn alike 'tis true  You have this once o'erreach'd me I confess  Love and fair  Rosamond  had fir'd my Hopes  But for thy Tonguerail onit hurts not me  What dost thou here Dost thou dissemble too  By my balk'd Joys thou'rt Partner in the Trade  Thou sharest in the Spoil and standest here  The Pander of thy Daughter's fulsome Lust  Clif  HoldLet me waitfor Heav'n itself perhaps  Will take my Part and blast thee on the Spot  Or does it leave me to revenge myself  This trusty Sword that never yet unmask'd  But in the Field of Honour shall for once  Be stain'd in single Fight with Traitor's Blood  Leic  Fortune and  Rosamond  but smile this Hour  And this shall be the Birthday of my Bliss  I draw the Sword of keenest Hate Come on  Fight  Clifford  falls  Clif  Leicester  the Glory and the Guilt is thine  That hast oppos'd thy Wrath to rev'rend Age  But Life was burdensomeand for this once  Ev'n Thou art kindI pity and forgive thee  O Heav'nHah who are these  Enter  Officer  and Guards  Offi  My Lord of  Leicester  I arrest thee here in the King's Name for Treason  In holding Correspondence with the  Scots  Secure him GuardWhat's hereLord  Clifford  fall'n  O cursed DeedHow fares it with your Lordship  Clif  Well art thou come to catch my parting Breath  For I perceive Compassion in thy Look  Bear my last Words to gentle  Salisbury  He shall report them where the Sound shall startle  And like the Voice of Heav'n command Attention    Henry  was once old  Clifford  's Royal Friend  And  Rosamond  was  Clifford  's only Daughter  But  Rosamond  and  Henry  more than kill'd me  For O this mortal Wound is Titillation  To Honour's painful StabYet witness Friend  That in this cool this reconciling Hour  I steep all Passion in Forgetfulness  Warn them some Angel ere Heav'n's Wrath be ripe  To separate their fatal Loves for ever  That we may meet in Harmony above  Where Folly Grief and Pain shall be no more  Dies  So prays as for his Soul the dying  Clifford  Offi  Heav'n hear thy pious Wish thou good old Man  For you my Lord but for this last black Deed  That makes ev'n Pity callous I could grieve  To bid you be prepar'd to die Tomorrow  Leic  It had been Cowardice to rush on Death  When Fate had other Mischiefs in Reserve  Else my own Hands had freed me from the World  And  Henry  's idle Spleen But let him know  I dare defy the utmost of his Power  Come Death come Hell I will be  Leicester  still  Offi  Far other Words in this Distress would betterâ–ª  Leic  Away I was not born to know Distress  My Soul hightow'ring on her fullfledg'd Wing  And independent on Contingency  Hears Fortune's airspent Arrows hiss beneath her  Defeated I still boast in my vast Purpose  I play'd a dang'rous but a noble Game  'Twas Fortitude to venture Life for Glory  And next to that 'tis Fortitude to die  I have but one Request to makeyour Leave  To see the Prince  Offi  I have no Orders to refuse you that  Leic  Yet for one Moment my tough Heart must bend  And Nature shock'd confess a transient Pang  The Dream of Bliss now swims before my Eyes  Fortune had plac'd my Happiness in View  And when I rush'd to grasp the solid Joy  She marr'd my Hopes and dash'd them to the Ground  The Merchant thus the wish'dfor Haven sees  And chears his Soul with Hopes of future Ease  But unforeseen the threat'ning Tempests rise  And Clouds blacklowring gather in the Skies  Winds roar Seas swell his shatter'd Bark is tost  And in a sudden Wreck his Mass of Wealth is lost  Exeunt  ACT IV SCENE I

confess a Crime  Thou dar'st no more deny than vindicate  Strive not in vain to deprecate my Wrath  Think on the Anguish of an injur'd Wife  Think on the Torture of a slighted Lover  Think on the Hatred of a pow'rful Rival  Think on all these and think on Death  Ros  O rather  Think on the Horrour of a Wretch that stands  Upon the Brink of Death but dares not die  My Soul is startled at the dreadful View  And ev'ry Weakness takes the sad Alarm  Queen  Art thou afraid to die I'd have thee so  'Tis Joy to antedate thy Misery  To suff'ring Virtue Death's a Remedy  To Guilt like thine alone

Race of Men  Hast copy'd best thy bright Original  Queen  And dost thou think to whine me from my Purpose  Can a Sigh cool the Sun's meridian Blaze  Or a Tear quench the Rage of spreading Flames  Then may this Shew of artifical Grief  Of forc'd Remorse appease my angry Soul  Ros  'Tis not in Art to mimic Grief like mine  Let me conjure thee as thou art a Woman  By all the nat'ral Softness of our Sex  Not in wild Haste to dye thy Hands in Blood  Much have I sinn'dbut O that Sin was Love  The yielding Weakness of a tender Maid  Ah what could Reason urge against the Force  Of Passion kindling in a female Breast  Queen  If female Passions sway with lordly Rule  Revenge may glow with Fires as hot as Love  Shall I forgive thee and destroy myself  What let thee live to triumph o'er my Folly  Again to riot in my  Henry  's Arms  And in each Fit of wanton Dalliance  To lisp and prattle o'er the dismal Tale  Then kiss and make him swear 'Tis pitiful  By Heav'n it makes Imagination mad  Ros

Ros  Let me but live Is that so great a Boon  I'll wander in the World a Vagabond  Turn'd loose from Humankind forlorn and wild  Each scornful Tongue that hail'd my happier Days  Shall mock my abject Fall I'll owe my Life  To common Charity from Door to Door  I'll beg Subsistence and be proud to feast  Upon the Refuse of gorg'd Appetite  And when the Wrath of Heav'n is satisfy'd  And the full Term of all my Woes expires  On the cold Flint I'll stretch my weary'd Limbs  And bless thy Name and die  Queen  Shame of thy Sex  Whom can thy Blessings help or Curses hurt  Why do I trifle thus It is

Fortune  Yes I will die and glory in my Passion  Shall  Henry  's Mistress fear a Rival's Rage  His Love shall chear me in my dying Moments  It shall deceive thy Cruelty to mark  With how serene a Brow I meet my Fate  And thou shalt envy Nature's parting Pang  Queen  So bold But we shall try this boasted Courage  Ros  Then be my Blood on thy devoted Head  My Lord my  Henry  shall revenge my Death  And when the World shall hear our fatal Story  Thy savage Rage and unrelenting Hate  Shall brand thy Name with Infamy for ever  My hapless Lot shall find a gentler Treatment  And Aftertimes indulgent to the Weakness  That present Censure magnifies with Malice  Shall rank me high among heroic Lovers  That liv'd Love's Votaries and dy'd its Martyrs  Queen  In that poor Comfort go and lose

What then must Guilt and feeble Woman feel  And must I fall by Ruffians brutal Hands  O yet forgive my Rashness spare my Life  Spare me at least the Horrour of this Sight  Discharge these ghastly and grimfeatur'd Wretches  And take my Life with thy own Royal Hand  Queen  It is beneath me Hence Away with her  Ros  Pause yet one last sad Moment and I go  Since Death is sure let me not die like one  That has no Foresight of a long Hereafter  Tongue cannot tell the Anguish I now feel  O may it purchase my eternal Peace  Thee mighty Queen I above Measure wrong'd  Yet this is surely Punishment

supreme allwise o'erruling Pow'r  That seest the mighty Wrongs of  Elinor  Bless if it seemeth good this honest Art  And touch with deep Remorse my  Henry  's Heart  But if 'tis fix'd by thy unalter'd Will  That I should still be scorn'd be wretched still  If 'tis recorded in the Book of Fate  That I was born to love and He to hate  The next sad Boon my weary'd Soul shall crave  Is Rest eternal and a peaceful Grave  Exit  SCENE III  Enter Prince  Henry  Earls of  Surry  and  Winchester  P  Hen  It cannot be The Army all dispers'd  And the  Scotch  King himself ta'en Prisoner  This strikes our blasted Purpose to the Root  Yet do we hold ourself as full of Spirit  And royal Quality as when we thought  To seat us in our Father's tott'ring Throne  But halt we here and cease the noble Chace  Let Glory hide awhile his radiant Head  Till bursting like the Sun from Ocean's Lap  Once more he pours the Beams of Day around  Say where's the Righthand of our Enterprize  The trusty  Leicester  Sur  May it please your Grace  By your Command I went last Night t' apprise  His Lordship of our sudden Overthrow  But he was then gone forth 'twas said in private  P  Hen  Shield him ye Stars my everfaithful Friend  That nurs'd my Youth e'en like a tender Plant  One Day to flourish in fair  England  's Garden  Winch  Look where he comes and lo a sullen Guard  Of Officers of State attend upon him  Death sits in Pomp upon each Countenance  Enter  Leicester  guarded  P  Hen  Whence is it  Leicester  that I see thee thus  I've known the Time when I had flown to meet thee  Swift as the fabled  Mercury  Methought  I could have grasp'd thee to my Heart for ever  And youthful Love's Embrace was cold to mine  But now forbidding Horrours dwell around thee  And this first Time I wish thee from my Sight  Far as quick Magic or the Stretch of Thought  Could waft thee hence Alas what mean these Bonds  Leic  I am thy Father's Pris'ner by what Chance  It matters not And 'tis with Joy I tell it  I shall not be so long for I'm to die  This World has trifled with my Expectations  And I shall leave it with Indifference  Like a disgusted Friend  P  Hen  Didst thou say die  Where is the Pow'r on Earth shall take thee from me  Against my Will By Heav'n my Heat of Soul  Transports me to the thund'ring Field of Battle  Have I no Friends Methinks ten thousand Swords  With sympathetic Rage should leave their Scabbards  And forcing Conquest from the Hand of Fortune  Rescue thy Life and my insulted Honour  Leic  Why dost thou spend thy frantic Breath in vain  Thus ruin'd as I am I pity thee  P  Hen  How steady is thy Heart Blest Lot of Virtue  O hadst thou clos'd thine Eyes in Honour's Bed  The glorious Fate had claim'd my Gratulation  But shall my Friend be led to formal Death  To shameful publick Execution  And make a Spectacle for vile Plebeians  Can I endure all thisCan I prevent it  The mournful Image sinks me into Childhood  And from my Eyes the Stream of Sorrow flows  Leic  Weep not for Tears are Woman's Ceremony  My Life has been a Hurricane throughout  And I will raise a Storm at my Departure  As the fell Lightning strikes while it does vanish  P  Hen  Thy Talk is wild Is't possible to save thee  I will unhinge the vast Machinery  Of Sov'reign Greatness that my Soul had fram'd  And be that dull unthinking Thing I was  Ere yet inspir'd by thy awak'ning Breath  The Flame of Glory play'd about my Heart  For thee I will renounce this Bauble Crown  Throw myself prostrate at my Father's Feet  And there solicit for thy valu'd Life  Leic  Think not of me solicit for thyself  Ask Pardon for the Follies of thy Youth  And promise better Carriage for the future  A little Whining will set Matters right  The old Man kindly takes you by the Hand  Bids you sit still and all shall be forgotten  P  Hen  Still  Leicester  dost thou thwart my good Intent  As if to be oblig'd were worse than Death  Leic  Then hear me hear me and be lost for ever  Thou poor misguided Tool thou Pygmy Monarch  Thou Frothmade Creature of a Courtier's Guile  Think not I ever bore Respect to thee  Further than Shew would answer my Design  Thou and thy fancy'd Title were the Engines  Of my Ambition and highcrested Hopes  Had Fate done Justice to my noble Daring  I'd rioted at Will in lawless Pow'r  And everblooming LoveO  Rosamond  My Thought still hangs on theeBut all is past  And the whole World is now not worth my Notice  P  Hen  Tell me good  Surry  does not this Man rave  Or am I here or who or what are you  O 'tis too much too much  Sur  Accursed Villain  You're much disturb'd my Lord You grasp my Hand  As you'd dissolve it and Convulsions rend  Your struggling Heart like the last Gasps of Nature  Leic  Why surely 'twill be glorious Fun'ral Pomp  When Princes are the Mourners  P  Hen  It shall be soWhere is this Son of Darkness  I will defile my Sword with his Heart's Blood  And drive his Soul back to the Devil his Master  Leic  Ay kill me do and I shall die in Triumph  P  Hen  Hold Shall I save him from the Hand of Justice  And honour his foul TreasonDrag him hence  Be sure you grind his Carcase into Dust  Then send each Particle to hottest Hell  To suffer sep'rate Pain  Leic  I leave my Imprecations to you all  I have disturb'd Mankind and die content  Exit guarded  P  Hen  If there's a Torment yet unfelt below  Thou wilt disturb the Damn'dFor me what's left  But airencount'ring Wrath and sad Despair  And selfreproaching ShameAre you my Friends  Give me Credentials of your Honesty  Smile cringe and hug and swear and then deceive me  Sur  Could I unfold the Bottom of my Heart  Your Grace would see it all your own  P  Hen  Impossible  I tell thee  Surry  there's no Faith in Nature  I'd ride a Bulrush in a stormy Sea  Ere I would trust a Friend Ingratitude  Thou damning Sin of Devils and of Men  Our PatriarchFather happy in himself  Enjoy'd his solitary Paradise  But his first Bosomfriend his Wife betray'd him  Winch  My Soul abhors the Falshood of that Traitor  For me  P  Hen  Heav'n only knows how much I lov'd him  He lay within my Bosom's closest Fold  And saw the Springs that mov'd my Soul to Action  Had one poor Morsel been my Life's Subsistence  And  Leicester  's craving Appetite unsated  He should have shar'd his Moiety exact  Ev'n to an Atom's Weight Ye heav'nly Pow'rs  Is this the Man that hath abus'd me thus  The brute Beast softens to good Offices  The churlish Cur frisks at his Master's Feet  Nay the great Lion fondles with his Keeper  And bloody Tygers lick the Hand that feeds them  Man only of all Creatures is ungrateful  Heav'n too but wastes its Bounty on the Wretch  Why sheds yon golden Orb his daily Light  Mark his meridian Brightness glares unheeded  By thankless Mortals like a common Meteor  Winch  Forget what's pastAwake your wonted Spirit  P  Hen  Never my LordBut Yesterday methought  Like a full Tide I spread myself abroad  While Plenty smil'd along my fruitful Shores  But now Heav'n's scorching Wrath has choak'd my Springs  My sinking Stream forsakes its thirsty Banks  And all my Urns are dryO I'm undone  Winch  Kind Heav'n send Peace to your disorder'd Soul  P  Hen  Why dost thou talk of Peace Orig'nal Chaos  Was more at Peace than I If thou would'st please me  Drive me into some vast Extremity  Some Precedent of Horrour yet unheard of  Would I could conjure up a hellish Spirit  Should rend asunder this Seamantled Isle  Sure I am fit for nought but some damn'd Deed  To chronicle my Name a Plague for ever  Sur  Come come my Lord Youth is a sportive Tale  That Men peruse and are not critical  The King will yet forgive on Terms of Honour  The Rashness of us all  P  Hen  Curse his Forgiveness  Was I acquitted to ten thousand Worlds  O I should damn myself Has  Henry  been  The chosen Instrument of Knavery  Still pliant to a Villain's forming Hand  Impartial Fame that registers all Deeds  Will write this first Page of my History  In Terms most vile and insignificant  Had I the nervous Arm of  Hercules  The ample Sway of  Philip  's conqu'ring Son  Proud  Caesar  's Fortune or great  Arthur  's Soul  Harry  and Fool would still be join'd together  O Shame eternal insupportable  Sur  To err is to be mortal Where is he  That falls not in the slipp'ry Path of Life  But future Conduct cancels Failings past  All may be yet retriev'd the cloudwrapt Morn  Is oft the Prologue to a glorious Day  P  Hen  Think'st thou I bear an ordinary Mind  Who sets out wrong ought to forego his Journey  Hence I'll divorce me from the faithless World  Step from the Prince and study to forget  My Royal Sphere 'till I am reconcil'd  To low Obscurity and abject Life  And ev'ry Thought be level with my Fate  Sur  These deep Refinements seem akin to Madness  Aside  Your Highness speaks the Language of Despair  P  Hen  I speak but what I feel Methinks 'tis done  By Heav'n I would not stoop to take a Crown  The Head that wears that shining Burden akes for'tâ–ª  Who rules too rules o'er Men and I'd not hold  All Earth upon Security precarious  As is the Weatherchanging Faith of Men  I hold no farther Correspondence with them  Let the vile Miscreants prey on one another  While I on Fortune's mischievous Caprice  Will diet my Reflection and refine  To pure Conception my Worldweaned Soul  How happy is the Sage in his Retreat  That human Footsteps never yet profan'd  No jarring Passions vex his gentle Breast  Peace crowns his Days his Nights unbroken Rest  Slave to no Int'rest aiming at no End  He neither fears a Foe nor wants a Friend  Careless what Nations rise what Empires fall  He hears not wild Ambition's noisy Call  Wise to shun Pleasure Fortune to defy  He only seems to live that he may die  Exeunt  ACT V SCENE I  Rosamond  asleep Enter the Earl of  Salisbury  SALISBURY  SEE where she lies asleep poor fallen Cherub  The maiden Freshness of th' ungather'd Rose  But imitates that Sweetness Fair to look on  Why art thou all Deformity within  Oh how unhappy is the Fate of Beauty  It tempts the Ruffian Hand of Violence  And like the Diamond sparkling in the Mine  With its own Lustre lights the greedy Spoiler  O  Rosamond  had but indulgent Heav'n  Blasted the early Spring of thy Perfections  'Tis like thy Life had been as innocent  As that same guiltless SlumberBut she wakes  I'll stand awhile apart  Ros  Have Mercy on me  My Fears confound meThis sad Dwelling seemsâ–ª  The Antichamber to eternal Darkness  They left me here to dreadful Meditation  And weary'd Nature since has sunk in Sleep  Am I to live Why then that Ceremony  That dismal Pomp of Death Or do they mock me  Staying the Execution of my Fate  To fright my ApprehensionHah Who's there  It is my Father's Friend the good Lord  Salisbury  Sals  O  Rosamond  I comeBut I must weep first  Ros  Weep Blood my Heart for ev'ry Tear he sheds  Dost thou behold me with a tender Eye  Thou that dost Honour to the House of  Clifford  While I vile Wretch was born but to disgrace it  Sals  Believe me Fairone these same falling Tears  Adorn thee more than Beauty's brightest Bloom  'Twas That betray'd thee to eternal Shame  And dy'd thy Soul in complicated Guilt  But Tears shall wash the scarlet Stains away  Ros  Thy charitable Care and mild Address  Bespeak my warmest ThanksSay my good Lord  Where is my injur'd Father May I hope  For once I knew him of a gentle Nature  He can have Pity on an only Child  Wretched and sad as Sin and Shame can make her  For ohDespair will sink me if I die  Beneath the Terrours of his righteous Curse  Sals  Alas my Friend thy Father is no more  But Yesterday he dy'd by  Leicester  's Hand  In his last Moments he remembred Thee  Think it an Earnest of forgiving Heav'n  He own'd his Daughter in that fatal Crisis  And bless'd thee with the Fervency of Pray'r  Ros  This was my Deed I kill'd this best of Fathers  I drove his hoary Age to Desperation  And made his Being painfulSo is mine  For I am now a Burden to myself  Yet he forgave mePonder that my Soul  'Tis growing Matter for eternal Thought  My Lord thou know'st my Doom Am I to die  Sals  You must prepare to live Last Night the Queen  But hypocritical in Cruelty  Beneath the Mask of Vengeance meant thee Mercy  That dreadful Guard that bore thee from the Palace  As to thy Fate when they convey'd thee hither  Fulfill'd their whole Commission in this Convent  Thou must commence the Votary of Heav'n  And bid Adieu to all the World for ever  Ros  Confess my Heart the Hand of Providence  Plain tho' unseen in all its Acts of Mercy  Here let me first in pious Gratitude  Implore a Blessing on her Royal Head  Who tho' my Rival was not less my Friend  May Peace and Joy and Love crown all her Hours  And when her Length of Life is fully spun  Let not Death seem a King of Terrours to her  But like a smiling Angel sent to guide  Her fleeting Soul to Realms of endless Bliss  Sals  Thy grateful Pray'r is just And now O think  Think what a Lesson thou must teach thyself  Canst thou forget the Luxury of Courts  The soft'ning Joys of Vanity and Ease  And Pleasure's sweet Inchantment of the Mind  Say canst thou quench the Fire of youthful Love  And blot the Name of  Henry  from thy Heart  Canst thou devote thyself to pious Deeds  To rigid painful Holiness of Life  To Meditation at the Midnight Hour  To constant Watchings and long Abstinence  This is the Physick of a sickly Soul  The Discipline that Penitence must take  Ros  O Terms of Life severe yet merciful  Wilt thou thou good old Man solicit for me  Thy pious Intercession well shall speed  My tardy Vows and bear them up to Heav'n  Hence I give up the World without a Sigh  The World What's that I give up  Henry  too  The Bubble breaks the painted Scene is clos'd  And now the calm and sadlypleasing View  Of peaceful Innocence and purer Joys  And Virtue blasted like a beaten Flow'r  Shocks my Remembrance and upbraids my Soul  Sals  Sense of past Vice is future Virtue's Basis  And Selfconviction at the Bar of Conscience  More awes the waken'd Mind than the Tribunal  Of solemn Justice and the Pomp of Law  Methinks I hear the Host celestial shout  And praise the noble Purpose thou hast made  Heav'n is not deaf to Sorrow's piercing Voice  Relenting it beholds the wounded Breast  And kindly sheds the healing Balm of Mercy  Ros  Thy Words distil the honey'd Sweet of Peace  A Beam of Comfort chears my sinking Soul  And brighter Prospects open to my View  Folly has sully'd my Renown of Youth  But strict Severity of Thought and Action  Shall change the black Complexion of my Guilt  To Snowwhite Purity Ages to come  Shall hear my Tale with Pity not Reproach  And those who curse the shameful Name of  Mistress  Shall bless the Convert and admire the Saint  Sals  If the blest Lot of righteous Men above  Admits of Augmentation it will glad  Thy Father's Spirit to perceive this Change  And give a better Relish to his Heav'n  Ros  From my Example let the Fair be warn'd  To shun the pleasing Snares of lawless Love  As they would fly the Serpent's bitter Tooth  Its sweetest Pleasures leave a Sting behind  To virtuous Minds Religion's Path is smooth  But she that falls like me like me must tread  The thorny Road of sad Remorse and Sorrow  Hail gloomy Mansions hail Here will I dwell  In lonely Cloisters and a dreary Cell  A sad Recluse I'll waste my Youth away  Steal from Mankind and shun the Face of Day  Exeunt  SCENE II  Enter King  Henry  and Attendants  K  Hen  At length the holy Task is full perform'd  And my freed Soul is clear of  Becket  's Murder  Now we may view our Royal State at Home  Our Brother  Scotland  is our Prisoner  If we think good we seize upon his Crown  Or bid him reign the Monarch of our Nod  Let him attend the Sentence of our Will  For our proud Son we trust this late Defeat  And  Leicester  's Death shall humble his high Spirit  Of him we shall think further at our Leisure  For now more tender Thoughts possess my Soul  To Love's soft Influence all its Motions yield  And ev'ry Passion owns its sov'reign Master  Queen of my Heart my  Rosamond  I come  Enter the Duke of  Cornwall  Hah  Cornwall  why that Terror in thy Look  Corn  Pardon my Liege the Messenger of Fate  That brings afflicting Tidings to your Ear  But what is done 'twere Folly to disguise  Then to be brief Last Night the jealous  Queen    K  Hen  Hold

tell me  Rosamond  is dead  Corn  See where she comes herself I stand discharg'd  Of my ungrateful Office  Enter  Queen  K  Hen  Can it be  With how compos'd a Brow she hides her Guilt  Dovelike Appearance with a Serpent's Heart  May I not hope a Woman will speak Truth  To do a Mischief Therefore tell me  Elinor  Without the forc'd Evasion of a Lye  Where is my Love my Life my  Rosamond  Queen  Would all King  Henry  's Foes were safe as she  Poor Wretch she's fast asleep  K  Hen  What dost thou mock me  Dost thou with Triumph own thy Cruelty  My vast Revenge shall tear theeSoft my Soul  This Rage becomes me notFly hence thou Tygress  Lest I forget in Wrath myself and thee  And stain my Hands ignobly with thy Blood  Queen  Thy Menaces great Monarch fright me not  What I have done was but the Deed of Justice  Didst thou believe me then so tame of Soul  That I could bear my Injuries for ever  Yet  Henry  in my utmost Pride of Heart  Let me confess my tender Love for thee  Cast out that hated Wanton from thy Thoughts  And I can yet forgive thee all my Wrongs  K  Hen  'Tis well Thank Heav'n in full Contempt I hear thee  But O Philosophy's no Cure for Love  This only Way Fate could unman my Soul  O  Rosamond  for ever ever lost  My Love was sweeter than the op'ning Flow'r  That trembles with the Morning silver's Dew  Fair as the Down of Swans or Mountain's Snow  Then she was faithful as the Turtle's Mate  And harmless as the Smile of Infancy  Why was I born a Ruler of the World  First Potentate on Earth and Lord of Nations  Yet could not keep one Jewel worth them all  O  Rosamond  for ever ever lost  Queen  Triumphant happy Rival ev'n in Death  Does then a Harlot's Fate deserve those Tears  Had the cold Tomb receiv'd me to my Rest  No Sigh had heav'd that unrelenting Breast  Thou wouldst have bless'd the lucky Destiny  That took away the nauseous Inconvenience  K  Hen  Time was I did revere thy boasted Virtue  Now thou hast done a Deed that startles Nature  And wouldst thou still profess thy Love for me  Can Hell produce Hypocrisy like thine  Would she that loves me stab me to the Heart  Couldst thou have form'd one tender gen'rous Thought  Thou hadst in Pity spar'd my Soul's first Darling  Thy Mercy had well prov'd thy Love unfeign'd  And won my Praise and Fame's fair Palm for ever  But now awayThou dost delight in Blood  Qu  Could I have hop'd my Lord by gentle Means  K  Hen  Silence false Woman Thou didst know full well  The Temper of my Soul by Nature noble  And now ev'n now I mean to prove it so  'Twas thine to gratify a mean Revenge  Thy King and Husband scorns to stoop so low  Go hence and let thy Punishment be Life  What have I done Alas my  Rosamond  Didst thou not call upon thy  Henry  's Name  Didst thou not wish me to avenge thy Death  Oh no thy tender Nature did forgive  The Stroke of Cruelty and dy'd in Smiles  Queen  I can no more  Joy to thy Heart thy  Rosamond  yet lives  K  Hen  Hah did I hear Was it an Angel's Voice  Speak it O speak again ye Heav'ns in Thunder  Queen  I told my Lord that  Rosamond  yet lives  K  Hen  Where is she Let me fly into her Arms  That I may tell my Heart's full Transport there  Lost Crowns recover'd sprightly Health restor'd  To Nature sunk were Blessings poor to this  Who sav'd her precious Life He's my best Friend  And let him take a Kingdom for his Service  Queen

know'st ought has chanc'd I charge thee speak  Corn  My Liege the  Queen  has utter'd but the Truth  K  Hen  O ye immortal Pow'rs how can this be  Queen  That I've this Day abus'd your Royal Ear  Thus humbly on my Knee I ask Forgiveness  'Tis the first Time I ever yet deceiv'd you  Let Actions speak for me hear and believe  How I have lov'd thee how I love thee still  Fortune last Night gave me

Fair  Where Heav'n I trust shall with free Grace accept  The pious Tribute of her future Duty  K  Hen  If this be trueand sure I feel it is  I must not dare not think how I have wrong'd thee  Earth does not bear so black a Wretch as me  What hast thou done Thou hast been wond'rous good  Yet cruel to ExcessSee her no more  Shine then no longer SunWhat not to part  Not one kind Word one Kiss one last Embrace  O mournful sad eternal Banishment  Banish'd From whence From a wild World of Folly  To Virtue's calm Abode banish'd to Heav'n  And am I griev'd at this because I lov'd her  O sudden painful Test of Sense and Honour  Strong is the Voice of Reason and of Virtue  But Love pleads too and Nature will be heard  Queen  I did not this with any mean Design  Virtue seeks no Advantage from her Deeds  Therefore I say not this deserves your Kindness  The cool Respect of Gratitude I scorn  My Love for thee was ever from the Heart  And equal Love alone can make me happy  Else tho' undone I

within me  An artful Villain tamper'd with the Soil  And spoil'd a goodly CropThe rest you know  Fortune unequal to my daring Cause  Has open'd since my Eyes I wak'd indeed  But only wak'd to see my Shame and Sorrow  K  Hen  Can I have Faith in this Thou hast deceiv'd me  P  Hen  'Twas in the fatal Day of youthful Follyâ–ª  But now the Purpose of Deceit is over  For I am going hence to that high

which makes it's first Appearance in the World in this MannerHe is to know then that  The Siege of ALEPPO  having been refused by the Managers of both Theatres to one of which  viz  Mr  Garrick  it was strongly recommended by Lady  Caroline Burdet  who is thereby intitled to my present grateful Acknowlegements would not have been offered to the Publick had it not been honoured with the Approbation of several Persons of the first Note in the Republick of polite Literature whom I am not at Liberty to mentionI am obliged to declare this in order to do common Justice to myself and to obviate the Prejudices which might be conceived against a Performance that has not had the  Credit  and  Advantage  of a  Theatrical Representation  But the  Play  must now speak for itself of which I shall say no more than just to premise that the  Fable  and whole  Construction  of it excepting the  Reality  of the  Siege  is purely  fictitious  That the  Incidents  were  designed  to be  natural  tho'  unexpected  not arising from  commonplace  Exigencies or  forced  Expedients which is too frequently the Case but from the  predominant Principles  of the  Characters  themselves And that for this Purpose I have endeavoured to give a  new  and something of an  original  Cast to the principal  Characters  particularly to those of  Theodore Sophronius  and  Ormelia  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  MANUEL  Governour of  Aleppo  THEODORE  a Christian Chief  OTHMAN  General of the  Saracens  SOPHRONIUS  Son to  Manuel  LEON  Friend to  Sophronius  ROMANUS  Lieutenant to  Theodore  IZRAIL  an

SCENE  a Piazza After several Shouts of To Arms To Arms c Enter  SOPHRONIUS  and  LEON  meeting  LEON  SOPHRONIUS welcome are our Messengers return'd from yonder Camp  Soph  Ev'n now my Friend  Leon  I ask not the Success  Soph  Those Shouts may tell you  Our Overtures of Peace were all receiv'd  With Scorn and Pride peculiar to these Spoilers  They know no Stile but that of Conquerours  And in the Fullness of their Hearts declare  The Faithful never take but give Conditions  Leon  Perhaps not yetI pr'ythee good  Sophronius  What Terms do these victorious Vagrants offer  Soph  First they invite us to embrace their Faith  And draw our Swords beneath the  Prophets  Banner  No more their Foes but Brethren of the War  If wedded to our Errours we reject  This friendly Proposition such they call it  The next Alternative is briefly this  That we confess the Prowess of their Arms  By paying yearly Tribute to the  Caliph  Leon  And it was this provok'd that glorious Uproar  Soph  The universal Voice is now for War  Soon as th' impatient Rabble caught the News  A Thousand Hearts were kindled in an Instant  And in the Wildness of new Zeal to Arms  To Arms they cry'd with such a clam'rous Shout  As tore th' Expanse of Heav'n and sure must strike  Ev'n yon Barbarian Troops with sudden dread  Though long inur'd to Terrours  Leon  Thou hast warm'd me  These martial Transports promise well  Sophronius  Perhaps the wrath divine that long has scourg'd  Our Follies Vices and corrupted Faith  With iron Rod of War at length relents  Nor farther will permit this vile Imposture  To make its Way with Death and Desolation  And like a Deluge whelm the Eastern World  Soph  Alas my Friend we seem unfit for Mercy  The seeds of Jealousy are sown among us  And should they spread and ripen to a Crop  Yon greedy  Mussulmen  will reap the Harvest  Our Passions  Leon  fight for  Mahomet    Union alone can save a sinking Land  And Concord is the strongest Nerve of War  Leon  Some distant Hints of this have reach'd mine Ear  'Tis said the baleful Breath of Whisperers  Has undermin'd the Worth of  Theodore  And shook his Credit with your Father  Manuel  Are these Suggestions true  Soph  Too trueMy Father  Whose Piety and ev'n paternal Care  Still anxious for the Welfare of his People  Raises him high in all Affections  Has yet the Leav'n of OldAge within him  With Rev'rence let me speak in his Dispraise  Leon  that Sigh declares too well thou seest  His eager Warmth his Frowardness of Temper  Impatient of Controul and fixt as Death  In all Resolvesto this Credulity  Too oft unlocks his Ear and gives Access  To a wellgarnish'd Tale  Leon  Proceed  Soph  Thou know'st  Some Moons have shed their Beams since  Theodore  Lodg'd in our Town his hardy Band of  Syrians  A voluntary AidThe  Saracens  Were then upon their March and  Manuel  gave  The Honours of our chief Command to him  Train'd from his active Youth a Son of War  He is no nice Observer of the Forms  The ceremonious Def'rence and the Duties  Preeminence expects from all beneath her  The desp'rate Fight that Yesterday he push'd  Unauthoris'd by  Manuel  some dark Foe  Has swell'd into a dang'rous Crime of State  Leon  It looks not wellthe gallant  Theodore  No Doubt has noble Worthsure that Presumption  Was but th' Effect of Valour's Confidence  Yet I have lately noted our  Aleppians  Like not the headstrong Fierceness of his Nature  That wants more Tincture of Humanity  Necessity they say unsheath'd the Sword  But hotbrain'd  Theodore  enjoys their Dangers  And revels savage in a Field of Blood  Soph  Truebut a Breach might be pernicious now  And yet  Sophronius  has another Fear  Leon  how frail at best is mortal Man  This Compound of Divinity and Passion  For oh believe me midst this gen'ral Horrour  While War with hideous Strides stalks round our Walls  Legions of Evils gathering in his Train  My Weakness robs my Country of my Thoughts  And half my Breast admits a private Care  Leon  Alas I know that CareYou woo  Ormelia  The Daughter of the valiant  Theodore    His other Joy and what he loves next War  Soph  Ay Friend for should this Cloud of Discontent  Once gather to a Storm will it not blast  Our growing Spring of Love Love did I say  'Tis true my secret Suit seem'd not ungrateful  But know that glorious Maid adores her Father  Nor marvel she's the Daughter of his Soul  His Spirit Fierceness and his Pride of Virtue  All glow within her Breast refin'd and cast  Into a softer MouldHence spring my Fears  Leon  There is Resemblance in our Lots  Sophronius  Thou know'st thy gentle Sister fair  Eusebia  Smiles on my honest PassionYet thy Father  Vows he will never sanctify her Choice  'Tis true my ruin'd Fortunes  Soph  Pr'ythee Peace  Thy Birth is noble and thy Virtue godlike  These give thee ample Title to  Eusebia  O could I call thee Brothersoothing Wish  And yet thou'rt more alreadyThou'rt my Friend  Embrace  Wait we the Will supremebut seemy Sister  Enter  Eusebia  Eus  Brother the Chiefs are summon'd all to Council  I heard Enquiry made for you and  Leon  Soph  I shall attend them  Leon  you will follow  Exit  Sophronius  Leon  Let me first pay more pleasing Duty here  Why sighs my Fair Our Hearts are sure our own  Those  Manuel  cannot partOh why that Tear  I know it falls for  Leon  cruel Fortune  Why was I born to spoil  Eusebia  's Peace  Eus  I fear we have indulg'd our Loves too far  As Children venture in a Calm to Sea  Regardless of the Cloud slowsweeping cross  The Vault of Heav'n and big with future Ruin  Leon  Yet let us not despairHeav'n oft afflicts  For Trial not DestructionTime may come  When my Heart's Truth my Service in the War  And all the virtuous Labours of a Life  Devoted to my Country and to thee  Will melt thy Father's Soul then shall he bless  My Toils and overpay me with thy Beauties  Eus  Could he but view thee with  Eusebia  's Eyes  Yet something whispers me we'ave done amiss  Why was our Love first made a Mystery  Why cover'd from the Day and from my Father  Who gave me right to fix my Heart on thee  'Twas Folly if not worseand  Manuel  's Anger  Perhaps is providentialfor till now  His Fondness still prevented my Desires  Leon  That Fondness was but Humourwhile he pleas'd  Thy tender Age he but indulg'd himself  Thou never hadst a Boon to ask till now  Eus  Hah  Leon  have a Care I love thy Virtue  That rais'd and that must justify my Passion  Urge not a Thought to shake my filial Duty  I always held the Name of Father sacred  Leon  This Rigour which I know not how to blame  May crush the Hope that yet supports my Being  I tremble while I speakperhaps thy Father  Means to compel thy Virgin Heartif so  Where will thy Duty be or where thy Love  Eus  Those Fears are vainI cannot love another  Virtue itself forbids it and my Heart  Flutters and tells me 'tis impossible  My Vows are thine oh spare a Maiden's Blushes  My ev'ry Joy my ev'ry Care is thine  Leon  O how shall I requite this wond'rous Goodness  Eus  Once more I will essay my Father's Temper  If he relents'tis all the Happiness  I wish on Earthif notsupport me Heav'n  Leon  He must he mustor Pity's fled from Man  Who could behold unmov'd such weeping Beauty  Thou fairer than the Morning's cloudless Dawn  Thou sweeter than the vernal Bloom that decks  Eus  AwayI am a Woman and a  Christian  Cease then these Strains of ordinary Lovers  That wound our Reason while they sooth our Pride  Nor suits thy Fondness with these Times of Danger  Courtship and Dalliance are mere Treason now  Thy Country calls thee  Leon  I obey the Call  Yet Beauty is the just Reward of Valour  Eus  But should not be its Hindrance  Leon  Matchless Wisdom  There is no longer Merit in those Eyes  But soft who comes this Way Let me conduct thee  Exeunt  SCENE II  Enter  Romanus  Rom  If I see right  Aleppo  thou art mine  If mine I yield thee to the  Saracens    While Modes of foolish Faith divide the World  And

knew the Bus'ness  Would thrive beneath thy WisdomPr'ythee tell me  How did the shallow  Manuel  take thy Tale  Mer  You'd laugh to see the old Man chafe  Romanus  Sound but the Name of  Theodore  he frets  Like a gall'd Jade he blames his sightless Folly  That ne'er discern'd how much th' officious Zeal  Of Yesterday which cost us so much Blood  Is puft with Pride and scorns to own a Master  Rom  Well saidMy Soul foresees much good from this  Mer  Soon as I found that Prejudice take Root  I scatter'd Hints as was agreed between us  That  Theodore  in Letters to our Emp'rour  Had oft complain'd of  Manuel  's Government  And thrown much Blame upon his wayward Age  Rom  I hope you touch'd that Point but tenderly  It surely was a Task for all thy Skill  Mer  Do I not practise Cunning under thee  I spoke it not my Friend as fit Foundation  To raise a certain Proof upon but what  Prudent Suspicion guess'd and therefore wish'd him  Henceforth in Judgment to compare this Notice  With  Theodore  's Demeanour  Rom  Thanks good  Mervan  Why what a ready Instrument is  Manuel  For Knavery to work withal  Merv  Why Knavery  We mean no Ill to him or to our Country  But Sir my Wrongs cry loudly for Revenge  I've been abus'd by  Theodore  Because  I deal not in his boist'rous Trade of War  He deems me but a Beast that will be tame  And patient of his BurthenCurses on him  Sure I can feel a Smart as well as he  And Vengeance has more Shapes than one  Romanus  Rom  Which he shall prove Shortly I hope to see  This fierce this blust'ring this allconqu'ring Hero  That has refus'd us both his bauble Daughter  With vile Contempt with Insolence refus'd her  Hurl'd from his airy Pinacle of Pride  Turn'd from his Post disgrac'd mark'd for a Traitor  And hooted like a Nusance through  Aleppo  Mer  Let me but see that Day my Soul's at Ease  Rom  So is not mineThou know'st not Half my Purpose  Aside  Then when the pinching Shame shall gripe him close  And more than Madness festers at his Heart  If thou should'st humbly ask him for his Daughter  Let him contract his angry Brow and tell thee  He scorns Alliance with a paltry Scribe  Mer  It was his very Answer to my Suit  Rom  I found a like Repulseat least 'tis fit  You think so  Aside  Yet believe me my Resentments  Burn not so strongly for myself as thee  Mine is a common DestinyIt seems  We petty Men of War are Slaves by Office  Mer  But not by Nature  Rom  Thou art right my  Mervan  And therefore to our Work Is it not better  Thus wisely to employ our active Pow'rs  And set the secret Springs of Mischief going  Than to bedew our Beards with childish Tears  And whimper in a Corner for a Toy  Mer  Romanus  I must ever thank thy Goodness  That saw me drooping with unmanly Sorrow  Taught me Revenge and wean'd me from my Follies  Rom  Thy Firmness charms mePr'ythee honest  When does the Council sit  Mervan  Mer  I guess 'ere now  Rom  Then let us hencethis Morning may afford  Some kind Event to bless our utmost Wishes  Ex  SCENE III  The back Scene opens and discovers the Council sitting  Manuel Theodore Sophronius Izrail Leon  and other Officers in Council  Man  Indeed the Progress of their Arms is wond'rous  How has their hungry War devour'd our Land  And like the dreadful Rage of Pestilence  Left a sad Track of Ruin in its Course  Whole Provinces are bent beneath the Yoke  And  Syria  's better Half is  Ababeker  's  Soph  Yet may we hope my Chiefs to save the other  Our Men are high in Blood and hot for Action  Thanks to the Foe for this Nay all  Aleppo  Breathes one heroic Ardour bending Age  Girds on his palsied Side the weighty Sword  Brides chace their youthful Husbands from their Arms  And Mothers trim their darling Sons to Battle  O for a Tempest's Blast to drive this Flame  Till it consume yon Vermin Tribes like Stubble  The  Well hast thou spoke  Sophronius  Wherefore then  Sit we thus idle and inactive here  While Boys and Women chide our tardy Councils  Who dreams again of Peace I hold him Coward  We'll plead once more our Cause in yonder Field  And wear our Reasons on our Weapon's Points  Up then and let us issue to the Plain  Man  Why all this Blaze of Words Are we not met  To lay the Plan of War and well consult  How we may best annoy the haughty Foe  Mean while I hold it meet to tell thee  Theodore  It ill becomes the Man that Yesterday  Lavish'd away so many Christian Lives  In his o'erfev'rish Zeal to dictate now  To Men of cooler Heads and sounder Judgments  The  Hah what did  Manuel  sayBy all  Iz  Nay hold  For this may go too far  Man  Izrail  take Heed  His Spleen may choke him else  The  Now in the Name  Of Honour and of Arms what means this Treatment  Am I reproach'd because I would have led  Thy dastard Troops the nearest Way to Fame  And taught them how to snatch a noble Conquest  Glory's the Soldier's Mistress to be woo'd  Where Death has planted all his Terrours round her  Or never to be wonHad thy  Aleppians  Kept firm their Ranks yon Camp had smoak'd to Heav'n  But Sir they poorly shrunk before the Foe  And let in Numbers like a Flood upon them  I hate these puny halfbred Sons of  Mars  That cooly stalk to fight on even Terms  But bid them grapple with unequal Fortune  They stand aloof and snarl like Curs at Distance  Man  Mervan  thy Fears were justI'll try him further  Aside  Say'st thou our Troops gave Way I will presume  To think they might dislike so blind a Leader  So Sir retrench the License of thy Tongue  Success had never justify'd an Action  That wanted the due Sanction of our Will  Soph  In what

busied on a bold Design  Big as my Soul could graspWas that a Time  For Forms precise or Speech quaintworded thus  Most worthy Sir with your good Worship's Leave  I'll cut yon Villain's Throat A

Friend not Vassal and as such  Was first receiv'd by this ungrateful City  Hast thou forgot old  Manuel  with what Shouts  Of gen'ral Joy what thund'ring Peals of Transport  Thy vile  Aleppians  welcom'd my Arrival  And hail'd me like the Genius of the Land  Man  No moreI hold not Conf'rence with a Traitor  Know henceforth I renounce thy vaunted Friendship  And from this Moment ceases thy Command  We want no Stranger Sir to fight our Battles  My Son the Charge of our  Aleppian  Troops  We do commit to thee for thou hast won  The Soldiers Heart They'll follow thee to conquest  And full Success shall prove my Choice was just  Soph  Worse than my Fears  Aside  O would my honour'd Father  Weigh but th' Importance of this Mighty Trust  With my green Years and yet untaught  Man  Away  Am I not Ruler here at least of thee  Let not  Sophronius  cross his Father's Purpose  The  'Tis wond'rous wellO ye immortal Spirits  Of my brave Ancestors whose laurell'd Deeds  Have swell'd the golden Trumpet of loud Fame  And rank'd you with the  Caesars  of the World  Was it for this I taught my Soul to pant  For high Renown and burn with all your Fires  To be supplanted by a silken Stripling  A Boy that trembles if his Finger bleeds  O Blot accurst upon the Name of Soldier  Soph  Sir I well know your Merit and admire it  I own thee first in Arms and shall be proud  To emulate thy Valour in the Fight  Yet let not warlike  Theodore  esteem  My Virtue of so small so mean a Size  But I shall nobly labour to maintain  The Character I sought not for and sweat  Boy as I am to reap my Share of Glory  Man  Spoke like the Son I love  The  It is enough  Joy to the Gen'ral to  Aleppo  Joy  The giddy Crew will well approve this Change  Perhaps the  Saracens  may thank you too  That as it may I leave you to your Fortune  Tomorrow's early Dawn shall light me home  And mark me  Manuel  by my Wrongs I swear  Should this proud City which methinks I see  Ready to take her fatal Turn of Ruin  Hereafter court my Aid with Tears of Blood  I'd give her up to her deserv'd Destruction  And know the Word of  Theodore  is Fate  Exit  Theodore  Man  In what a Heat departs this noisy Chief  I hope none present disapprove my Deed  Iz  You could no lessHis Pride demanded it  Man  Think we no more of himHaste thee  Sophronius  To the glad Troops prepare them for Engagement  For thou shalt sally forth before yon Sun  Has dipp'd his Beams in Oceanrouse their Souls  To Christian Fortitude remember them  Life Liberty Religion call to Arms  Thou Pow'r supreme if yet we may presume  Thy righteous Vengeance has not fix'd our Doom  Relenting O behold this wretched Land  And guide our Battle with thy mighty Hand  Thy injur'd Truth to Infidels make known  And vindicate a Cause so much thy own

Eyes  The  What hast thou seenmethinks I burn to hear thee  Rom  You Sir yourself my Godlike  Theodore  In villainous Effigies hoisted up  On a high Pole and born along the Streets  By the licentious Rabble one attir'd  In antick Garb the lewdest of the Tribe  With solemn Pace headed this Pageantry  And ever and anon the saucy Crew  With Bonnets off in mock Obeisance cried  All Hail Lord Gen'ral Hail great  Theodore    While the wise Citizens still fond of Change  Blest the Conceit and grinn'd their Approbation  I met the vile Procession and although  Prudence had lock'd the Organ of my Speech  Sure they must see a Lion in my Eyes  The  Ungrateful senseless and inhuman Villains  What have I fac'd the Rage of Seasons round  The Dogstar's Beam and Winter's frozen Shafts  Renounc'd the soft Delights of balmy Peace  And dash'd the honey'd Cup of Pleasure from me  Have I made Things most terrible to Sense  Sweet to my Soul as Sleep to weary Labour  To be repaid at length with publick

TRAGEDY ALTERED FROM SHAKESPEARE  As it is perform'd at the THEATREROYAL in CoventGarden  By WILLIAM HAWKINS M A Late Fellow of Pembroke College and Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford  LONDON  Printed for JAMES RIVINGTON and JAMES FLETCHER at the Oxford Theatre in Paternosterrow MDCCLIX  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Countess of Litchfield  MADAM  I Have the honour of your LADYSHIP'S permission to present to you a Tragedy which though it met with numerous and unprecedented difficulties and discouragements in the theatre will I hope be thought not altogether unworthy your protection in the worldIndeed if the unpopularity of its late situation could in the least affect that degree of merit which your LADYSHIP'S candor or the indulgence of the town may allow it to have it would ill become me to recommend  it to my readers under the sanction of so polite and illustrious a nameBut your LADYSHIP has too much good sense as well as generosity to judge of this performance by mere appearances and accidental or unlucky circumstances and therefore tho' it will stand as a kind of memorial of the bad fortune and worse treatment of its author it may at the same time be a proper testimony of the high respect with which I am  Madam  Your Ladyship's most obliged and most obedient Servant WILLIAM HAWKINS  Feb  PREFACE  THE Tragedy of  Cymbeline  is in the whole oeconomy of it one of the most irregular productions of  Shakespeare  Its defects however or rather its superfluities are more than equalled by beauties and excellencies of various kinds There is at the same time something so pleasingly romantic and likewise truly  British  in the subject of it that I flatter myself an attempt to reduce it as near as possible to the regular standard of the  drama  will be favourably received by all who are admirers of  novelty  when  propriety  is its foundation I have accordingly endeavoured to newconstruct this Tragedy almost upon the plan of  Aristotle  himself in respect of the  unity  of  Time  with so thorough a veneration however for the great  Father  of the  English  stage that even while I have presumed to regulate and modernize his design I have thought it an honour to tread in his steps and to imitate his Stile with the humility and reverence of a  Son  With this view I have retained in  many  places the very language of the original author and in  all  others endeavoured to supply it with a diction similar thereunto so that as an unknown friend of mine has observed the present attempt is intirely  new  whether it be considered as an  alteration from  or an  imitation of Shakespeare  The  difficulty  of such an attempt as  rational  as it may be has a kind of  claim  I presume to the  indulgence  of the public especially as it has been attended likewise with  disadvantages  For I found myself necessitated by my plan to  drop some  characters to  contract others  and to omit  some  scenes and incidents of an interesting natureor rather to bring the substance and purport of them within the compass of a few short narrationsA loss irreparable this but that conveniencies are likewise to be thrown into the opposite scale for as I hope I have not  injured  any characters by  contracting  them but have left them to  all intents  and in point of  importance  the  same  so I have had an opportunity of  enlarging  and  improving some  of the original parts those particularly of  Palador  and  Philario  the  Pisanio of Shakespeare  and by varying certain incidents and circumstances of giving a  new cast  to the whole  drama  After all I am very far from meaning to detract from the merit of  Shakespeare  orâ–ª from insinuating that the plays of so exalted a genius  require  such  newmodelling as the present in order to the rendering them useful or entertainingI have ventured publicly to defend this great  dramatic  Poet in the liberties he has taken but still  Shakespeare  himself needs not be  ashamed  to  wear  a  modern dress  provided it can be made tolerably to  fit  him  The only question then will be whether the present  alteration  be a judicious oneAnd this with all due deference is left to the candour and justice of the public  It will be proper to acquaint the reader that this play was recommended some time since by a person of the first distinction to the manager of the other theatre who declared that he had the very same altered play in his possession and that it was designed for representation on his stage Our  Cymbeline  therefore was obliged to take up his head quarters at  CoventGarden  where he has contended not only with the  usual  difficulties but also with  others  of an  extraordinary  natureMrs  Bellamy  's declining the part of  Imogen  has done the play incredible prejudice and convinces me of the vanity of striving against the stream of popularity in general or the weight of particular disadvantagesHowever I am under obligations to  many  of the performers for their best endeavours to do justice to my piece and for their zeal for its success To  some  I am indebted for real service whose names as comparisons are invidious I leave it to the judgment of the reader to supply  Upon the whole I am at a loss to ballance the account between myself and my fortune in this whimsical situation The kind assistance and I hope not extremely partial approbation of  some  adds as much to my  credit  and  satisfaction  as the  delicacy  or  illnature  c of  others  has deducted from my  advantages  To my  friends  I return my sincere acknowledgments and best wishes to my  enemies  I shall say nothing 'till they are  candid  and  sagacious  enough to speak more  plainly  than they have hitherto doneand more  to the purpose  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr ROSS  BRITONS the daring Author of tonight  Attempts in Shakespear's manly stile to write  He strives to copy from that mighty mind  The glowing veinthe spirit unconfin'd  The figur'd diction that disdain'd controul  And the full vigour of the poet's soul  Happy the varied phrase if none shall call  This imitation that original  For other points our new advent'rer tries  The bard's luxuriant plan to modernize  And by the rules of antient art refine  The same eventful pleasing bold design  Our scenes awake not now the am'rous flame  Nor teach soft swains to woo the tender dame  Content for bright example's sake to shew  A wife distress'd and innocence in woe  For what remains the poet bids you see  From an old tale what Britons ought to be  And in these restless days of war's alarms  Not melts the soul to love but fires the blood to arms  Your great forefathers scorn'd the foreign chain  Rome might invade and Caesars rage in vain  Those glorious patterns with bold hearts pursue  To king to country and to honour true  Oh then with candour and good will attend  Applaud the author in the cordial friend  Remember when his failings most appear  It ill becomes the brave to be severe  Look ages back and think you hear tonight  An antient poet still your chief delight  Due to a great attempt compassion take  And spare the modern bard for Shakespear's sake  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs VINCENT  WELL Sirsthe bus'ness of the day is o'er  And I'm a princess and a wife no more  This bard of our's with Shakespear in his head  May be welltaught but surely is illbred  Spouse gone coast clear wife handsome and what not  We might have had a much genteeler plot  What madness equals true poetic rage  Fine stuff a lady in a hermitage  A pretty mansion for the blooming fair  No tea no scandalno intriguing there  The gay beaumonde such hideous scenes must damn  What nothing modish but one cordial dram  Yet after all the poet bids me say  For your own credit's sake approve the play  You can't for shame condemn old British wit  I hope there are no Frenchmen in the pit  Or slight a timely tale that well discovers  The bravest soldiers are the truest lovers  Such Leonatus was in our romance  A gallant courtier tho' he cou'd not dance  Say wou'd you gain like him the fair one's charms  First try your might in hardy deeds of arms  Your muffs your coffee and downbeds forego  Follow the mighty Prussia thro' the snow  At length bring home the honourable scar  And love's sweet balm shall heal the wounds of war  For me what various thoughts my mind perplex  Is't better I resume my feeble sex  Or wear this manly garb it fits me well  Gallants instruct meladies can you tell  The court's divided and the gentle beaux  Cryno disguisesgive the girl her cloaths  The ladies say tonight's example teaches  And I will take their words without more speeches  That things go best whenwomen wear the breeches  Dramatis Personae  CYMBELINE Mr RYAN  CLOTEN

Our late good queen you knew her sir whose age  Was thought t'advance beyond more hope of children  Yet brought the joyful Cymbeline a daughter  And to his kingdoms a most hopeful heir  In lieu of those he lost for Imogen  Such is her name took all the graces in  Which the best wisdom of the times put to her  As we do air fast as 'tis minister'd  If beauty innocence and gentleness  Are woman's rarest jewels she is rich  In most full measure of possession  st LORD  You speak her fair  d LORD  But not to flatter sir  Tho' I should talk the sun down You have heard  The bright side of the story

widow bold ambitious cunning cruel  That rul'd his heart by acting what she was not  She mov'd the cred'lous king to wed his daughter  With Cloten her own son a wretch in whom  All qualities that dub a worthy man  Are low as worst reportThe princess cast  Disdain upon his suitand in mean time  My plotting stepdame dies  st LORD  A lucky death  d LORD  'Twas thought soBut the king in whom this weakness  Is his first point of fault pursues the aim  Of his now dead belov'd and wills the maid  To take the crown with this encumbrance Cloten  Or hold her birthright void  st LORD  Alas poor lady  d LORD  Nay there's more woe behindSweet Imogen  Had long been list'ning to the earnest suit  Of Leonatus a young lord o'th' court  A valiant frank and honest gentleman  That has no vice if poverty be none  And to say all as much unlike to Cloten  As man can be to manHim in pure love  And to undo all aims she weds and makes  The deed soon known her boast th'enraged king  Sends Leonatus into banishment  And her within the circle of this castle  Enforceth to abide till she consent  To break her bond to her newwedded lord  By strong propos'd divorceThis is the sum  Of what you wish'd to hear  st LORD  What say the Britons  To these proceedings  d LORD  As their humours vary  Some blame the king all pity Imogen  And much lament the loss of Leonatus  Now the black Romans swarm upon our

name  Caesa that hath more kings his servants than  Thyself domestic officers to know  If in repentant yielding thou wilt pay  The yearly tribute of three thousand crowns  Granted by fam'd Cassibelan thine uncle  For him and his succession to great Julius  Which by thee lately is untendered left  Now fell confusion sets his standard up  And fearful wars point at you  CYMBELINE  Noble Lucius  Words

embassy to claim  This yet contested tribute I remember  The boast that fill'd your mouthyou vaunted then  The nat'ral brav'ry of your isle which stands  As Neptune's park ribbed and paled in  With rocks unscaleable and roaring waters  With sands that would not bear your enemies boats  But suck them up to th' topmastWe have leaped  This allforbidding fenceand sir be sure  Where'er the Roman banner waves in wrath  Conquest limps not behind  During this speech  Cloten  whispers  Pisanio  CYMBELINE  Had Julius found  In ev'ry land he mangled with his sword  No stabler footing than he gain'd him here  I could have bought his empire for a tithe  Of Britain's leanest soilNo more of this  Tomorrow we will meet you in the field  And this fair land is yours if you can win it  If not our crows shall fare the better for you  Caius thou'rt welcome give him tendance lords  And feast him as befits his quality  The due of honour in no point omit  Once more my hand in friendship from this time  I

his fever's flame  PISANIO  My lord as soon  As I had foot in Italy I challeng'd  Th' abused Leonatus with some friends  To the appointment of a merry meeting  Where as the wine danc'd brainward I began  To praise the freedom of the British ladies  Their lib'ral hearts and am'rous 'complishments  When Leonatus vow'd I did them wrong  And was too bold in my persuasion  CLOTEN  So  PISANIO  I fast held me to my sentiment  And for his doubt provok'd me swore myself  Had tasted half the court and his own princess  Whose virtue he had deem'd unparagon'd  At her own suit in bed  CLOTEN  Most brave brave Roman  PISANIO  On this the Briton vaults me from his seat  And bids my ready sword avow th' affront  Done his pure lady's honourI with looks  Of calm assurance and arms folded thus

might  Whereto his fury tended  CLOTEN  Thanks Pisanio  Saw you him since  PISANIO  No but the rumour was  Ere I left Rome that he had turn'd his thought  To bloody purpose of revenge  CLOTEN  'Tis

on without  Obeisance to the sunHail thou fair heav'n  We house i' th' rock yet use thee not so hardly  As prouder livers do  PALADOR  Hail heav'n  CADWAL  Hail heav'n  BELLARIUS  Our life my boys is such as mortals led  Ere living was an art The busy knaves  That clatter in yon world are mad to purchase  Honour with danger wealth with envy pleasure  With manifold infirmity while we  Poor in possession in enjoyment rich  Have no more wants than means our av'rice is not  Wider than are our stomachs our ambition  Who first shall scale the steepy mountain's cliff  Or strike the destin'd venison this is life  And health the life of life  CADWAL  My rev'rend father  Out of your proof you speakwe poor unfledged  Have never wing'd from view o' th' nest nor know  What air's from home haply this life is best  If quiet life is best sweeter to you  That have a sharper known  PALADOR  What shall we speak of  When we are old as you When we shall hear  The rain and wind beat dark December how  In this our pinching cave shall we discourse  The freezing hours away We have seen nothing  We're beastly subtle as the fox for prey  Like valiant as the wolf for what we eat  Our courage is to chace what flies our cage  We make a choir as doth the prison'd bird  And sing our bondage freely  BELLARIUS  How you speak  Did you but know the cities' usuries  The art o' th' court the toil of war that goes  In quest of honest fame yet dies i'th'search  And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph  As record of fair act did you know this  How would you smile in solitudeOh boys  The sharded beetle is in safer hold  Than is the fullwing'd eagleI was once  First with the best of noteCymbeline lov'd me  And when a soldier was the theme my name  Was not far offThen was I as a tree  Whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night  A storm or robb'ry call it what you will  Shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves  And left me bare to weather  PALADOR  Uncertain favour  BELLARIUS  My fault was nothing as I oft have told you  But that two villains sland'ring my fair honour  Swore me confed'rate with the Romans so  Follow'd my banishment and these twenty years  This rock and these demesnes have been my world  Where I have liv'd at honest freedom paid  More pious debts to heaven than in all  The foreend of my timebut up to the woods  This is not hunter's languageHe who brings  The largest fardle home is lord o'th'feast  CADWAL  Come Palador  Exeunt  Pal  and  Cad  BELLARIUS  I'll meet you in the valleys  Thou divine nature how thyself thou blazon'st  In these two princely boys O Cymbeline  Thy sons tho' train'd thus meanly up among  These desart rocks have lofty thoughts that hit  The roofs of palaces'tis wonderful  That an invisible instinct should frame them  To royalty unlearn'd honour untaught  Civility not seen from others valour  That wildly grows in them but yields a crop  As if it had been sow'dWellI must after  Exit  SCENE

To hear I'm false oh oh  PHILARIO  She heeds me not  IMOGEN  False to his bed what is it to be false  To lie in watch there and to think on him  To weep 'twixt clock and clock if sleep charge nature

conviction of her virtue  To probe her still more deeplyI have yet  More test to put her to  Aside  IMOGEN  Alas Philario  Some jay of Italy with painted feathers  Hath robb'd me of his heart poor I

it doth provoke belief  The face of virtue shall from hence be thought  The mask of villainy and Leonatus  Hath laid the level to all proper men  Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd  From his great fall  IMOGEN  Take up thy sword Philario  Behold my breast obedient as the scabbard  I liv'd but to one end to do his pleasure  And to that end would die  PHILARIO  O gracious lady  Since I receiv'd command to do this bus'ness  I scarce have slept one wink  IMOGEN  Do't and to bed then  PHILARIO  I'll wake mine eyeballs blind first No thou sweetest  If he hath stain'd his loyalty his mind  Is now as low to thine as were his fortunes  What shall his vileness batteries erect  To shake thy fort of innocenceLive lady  To kill him with thine eyehe shall be told  That I have done his

pair of worthies  BELLARIUS  Sir your patience  This gentleman whom I call Palador  Most worthy prince as your's is true Guiderius  This gentleman my Cadwal is Arviragus  Your younger princely son he sir was lapt  In a most curious mantle wrought by the hand  Of his queen mother which for more probation  I can with ease produce  CYMBELINE  Guiderius had  Upon his neck a mole a sanguine star  It was a mark of wonder  BELLARIUS  This is he  Who hath upon him still that nat'ral stamp  It was wise nature's end in the donation  To be his evidence now  CYMBELINE  'Tis he 'tis he  O sure today the

The first I make be grantedthee Bellarius  We must at leisure thank and you Philario  We shall set down our friend dear brother Cadwal  I can't yet call thee by that other name  Thou shalt be part'ner

prospect of a glorious peace  Exeunt omnes  FINIS  AN ESSAY ON GENIUS  AN ESSAY ON GENIUS  INQUIRE dispute reply and all you can  Say what is  Genius  but the Soul of Man  Beam of that Light which animates our Frame  Alike in many but in none the same  'Tis with our Minds as with our Bodies none  In Essence differ yet each knows his own  Marks of specific Character we see  That stamp on ev'ry Mortal THIS IS HE  Nor varies more our present outward Shape  This Man halfAngel and the next halfApe  Than do the mental Pow'rs What Odds we find  Between a's and a  Newton  's Mind  Ask you the Cause First take it for a Rule  Whate'er the Man the Soul is not a Fool  She came in due Perfection from the Skies  And all Defect in grosser Body lies  Body and Soul at best but ill agree  'Tis Spirit wedded to Infirmity  A disproportion'd Match from whence proceeds  The Soul's Inaction thro' the Body's Needs  This Truth once stated and the Soul 'tis plain  Much on the filmy Texture of the Brain  Much on Formations that escape our Eyes  On nice Connections and Coherencies  And on corporeal Organs must depend  For her own Function's Exercise and End  Hence then the Cause of all Defects is seen  For one wrong Movement spoils the whole Machine  'Tis hence the sev'ral Passions take their Rise  The Seeds of Virtue and the Roots of Vice  Hence Notes peculiar or to Young or Old  Phlegmatic sanguine amorous or cold  And hence from Constitution such or such  Wit may take Modes and  Genius  op'rate much  The youthful Bard a sprightly sanguine Swain  Like  Ovid  warbles in a Lovesick strain  With weaker Passions but with Sense more strong  The melancholy  Young  pursues his Song  Mixture of Humours motley  Genius  shews  'Tis seen methinks in  Hervey  's dancing Prose  Why wonder then to mark the Sons of Rhyme  Gay serious turgid easy or sublime  The Soul and Body closely thus allied  Vile is the Folly as the Sin of Pride  And one great Truth the first of Men will fit  That Nothing more precarious is than Wit  Behold yon Wretch that o'er the Parish strays  A BabyMan a Driv'ler all his Days  With Tongue outlolling and roundrolling Eyes  He grins against the Sun and catches Flies  But for some secret Flaws we cannot read  That check her Motions and her Flights impede  His Soul perchance enrich'd with happiest Thought  Had spoke like  Tully  or like  Virgil  wrote  Alas All Souls are subject to like Fate  All sympathizing with the Body's State  Let the fierce Fever burn thro' ev'ry Vein  And drive the madding Fury to the Brain  Nought can the Fervour of his Frenzy cool  But  Aristotle  's self's a Parish Fool  Nay in Proportion lighter Ails controul  The mental Virtue and infect the Soul  Ease is best Convoy in our Voyage to Truth  What Man e're reason'd with a raging Tooth  A Poet with a  Genius  and without  Are the same Creatures in the Pangs of Gout  Hence then we guess nor vain is the Surmise  Why some are Fools and none are always wise  Why  Genius  differs in Life's ev'ry Stage  Runs wild with Youth and creeps with hobling Age  The Soul uncumber'd with the mortal Clay  Knows no Increase of Strength nor fears Decay  A little Art this Secret may unfold  That what can never die is never old  By present Pow'rs Perfection cease to Scan  For we may daily mourn the Fall of Man  Ah how bright Wit possest of ev'ry Gift  Dwindled to Folly and went mad in  Swift  The mighty  Marlb'rough  whose great Soul was prov'd  Upon the Plains of  Blenheim  where unmov'd  "Amidst Confusion Horrour and Despair  "He view'd around the dreadful Scenes of War  "In peaceful Thought the Field of Death survey'd  "To fainting Squadrons sent the timely Aid  "Inspir'd repuls'd Battalions to engage  "And taught the doubtful Battle where to rage"  Ev'n He the Springs of Nature in Decay  And all the vital Functions worn away  Unable now to conquer Realms or buy  With ideot Gesture and unmeaning Eye  Sits a Spectatour in the foremost Row  And gapes at Heroes in a PuppetShew  Eschew Presumption ev'ry halflearn'd Elf  The noblest Writer does not know himself  Turn over mighty  Milton  's raptur'd Page  Observe his Strength his Majesty his Rage  His Numbers like th' Almighty's Thunders roll  And strike an awful Pleasure to the Soul  We joy in Ruin and are almost pain'd  To see the late lost  Paradise regain'd  This Work himself judg'd best tell me who read  Was not the mighty  Milton  blind indeed  Genius  again by Inf'rence apt we see  The same in Species differs in  Degree  Propensities are strong and few Men yet  But have a Relish for some kind of Wit  Homer  is Monarch of the Epic Choir  Yet  Virgil  snatch'd a Brand of  Homer  's Fire  The daring  Homer  's allimpetuous Strain  Like a hot Courser bore him o'er the Plain  The Muse of  Virgil  that affected State  Speeds not so swiftly but she keeps her Rate  To those tho' meet to yield the Glory due  Lucan  and  Statius  have their Merits too  Each Writer is distinguish'd in his Way  Grand  Sophocles  or trifling  Seneca  All to their fav'rite Art will lay Pretence  'Tis Inclination or 'tis Excellence  'Midst Clouds of Dulness Gleams of Wit have shone  Like the faint Burstings of an  April  Sun  Grant you what's past and it will less perplex  To ask why Woman is the weaker Sex  Why the Extremes of female Wits are such  They mostly say too little or too much  Beauty's soft Frame for other Ends design'd  Faints under Toil of Body or of Mind  Kind Heav'n that gave them Beauty all things gave  The soundest Scholar is a Woman's Slave  Glibly their Tongues the pretty Lispers move  "And Nonsense will be Eloquence in Love"  Yet have we known superiour Nymphs that can  Assert an equal Pow'r and rival Man  Born Nature's Wonders in all Shapes to please  To speak with Eloquence to write with Ease  To model Laws and rule a factious Realm  Witness ELIZA at Old ENGLAND'S Helm  Nay diff'rent Countries diff'rent  Genius  make  Souls Modes peculiar to their Climate take  Baeotia  's foggy Air was mark'd of old  Athenian  Wits were bright and  Theban  cold  Just view near Home the Surface of the Ball  In  Holland Genius  is mechanical  In  France  the Muses breath a livelier Strain  They skip in  Italy  and strut in  Spain  In England Oh how manifold our Rhyme  Where  Genius  is uncertain as the Clime  We shew consult the Press the Stage the Schools  All Sorts of Wise Men and all Sorts of Fools  We count our Numbers of illustrious Name  That climb'd by diff'rent Paths the Hill of Fame  Ye Bards of  Britain  that have shin'd in Song  Oh let the Muse survey your tuneful Throng  Chaucer  who notes not with a merry Glee  Thy  Genius  full of quaint Festivity  Who reads must see and seeing must admire  Bright  Spencer  's Fancy and bold  Milton  's Fire  Genius  was studied Wit in artful  Ben  But flow'd spontaneous  Dryden  from thy Pen  'Twas thine in manly Richness to excel  With twice thy Labour few write half so well  Fletcher  had copious Energy of Mind  Cowley  's was Wit let loose and  Wycherly  's confin'd  Who but applauds soft  Otway  's melting Lay  The negligent Simplicity of  Gay  The genuine Mirth that tickled  Butler  's Vein  Waller  's terse Sonnet and  Garth  's nervous Strain  Such various Forms does  Genius  take to please  In  Rowe  'tis Elegance in  Prior  Ease  In  Lee  'tis Flame that lays half Nature waste  And in the Courtly  Addison  'tis Taste  'Tis comic Grace in  Steele  that shunn'd Offence  In  Pope  'tis Sweetness Purity and Sense  'Tis Humour in the DEAN unequall'd yet  And  Congreve  who could stand thy twoedg'd Wit  To sev'ral Bards their sev'ral Virtues fall  But to inimitable SHAKESPEARE All  SHAKESPEAREO Phoebus lend thy golden Lyre  Give me the Beams of thy coelestial Fire  Avaunt ye Vulgar Poets listen round  And all PARNASSUS thunder with the Sound  While the Muse dwells on SHAKESPEARE'S sacred Name  And down Time's rapid Tide bears his immortal Fame  The Rapture's o'erI pant in vain to sing  Droops the weak Muse and flags her languid Wing  She sinks beneath the Theme she quits her Lays  SHAKESPEARE she nam'd and Silence is her Praise  Assert we then the Force of  Genius  lies  In Verse alone Are Poets only wise  We hinted  Genius  is of various Kind  And vast the Province of the human Mindâ–ª  Who well performs his fateallotted Part  By Strength of Nature or by Dint of Art  Whate'er the Subject of his happy Skill  The Product is the Work of  Genius  still  What honied Dew distill'd from  Tully  's Tongue  What soft Persuasion on his Accents hung  So smoothly strong the sweet Oration flows  'Tis plain the Muses sometimes speak in Prose  Bid him write Verses who but will agree  Cibr  can make as good an Ode as He  'Tis nought but  Genius  that in all presides  Commands in Battle and in Council guides  Sad Woes ensu'd where Fools have Squadrons led  For what is  Caesar  's Arm without his Head  Nor needs the Muse to distant Regions roam  Genius  appears in ev'ry Shape at home  A glorious List in British Annals shines  Of Statesmen Chiefs Philosophers Divines  Long Lucubrations o'er the midnight Oil  Gave to the World a  Newton  and a  Boyle  Each  Alma Mater  boasts her fav'rite Own  OXFORD her  Bradley  CAMBRIDGE  Sanderson  'Tis not a puny Judge can find a Flaw  In  Sherlock  's Gospel or in  H  's Law  What plenteous Streams of easy Sense we see  In fluent  Tillotson  's Divinity  Yet fluent  Tillotson  had nought to say  Had not the solid  Barrow  led the Way  Others may fright you from the Tempter's Gin  But  South  will make a Man asham'd of Sin  Nay some we know and knowing we must smile  Blest with a Talent but without a Stile  Hammond  stands foremost of this awkward Line  A rumbling Writer but a deep Divine  Who ever knew so strange a Vein as His  Or so much Learning in  Parenthesis  T'would tire the Muse and Reader to proceed  From reas'ning  Chillingworth  to florid  Seed  The Works of Christian Labour to explore  Of  Hooker Pearson Laud  and Numbers more  That drew their manly Quills for righteous Ends  The Church's Champions and Religion's Friends  I grieve to think what Souls have been destroy'd  By Wit perverse and  Genius  misemploy'd  For nought awakes so soon the vengeful Rod  As Wisdom flying in the Face of God  The Force of Reason is of finite Length  This Giant that attempts beyond his Strength  Our boasted Light of Nature feeble Spark  Guides for a while but leaves us in the Dark  As glimm'ring Vapours with a pallid Ray  Light us to Quagmires and to Gulphs betray  How vain is mortal Man above his Sphere  Poor knowing Fool just wise enough to err  Go span the Globe the World's strong Bounds o'releap  Empty the yawning Caverns of the Deep  Count all the Fibres of that Reptile's Thigh  Catch me the trembling Sunbeams as they fly  Then take thy Understanding's CableLine  Examine God and measure Truths divine  Grant me kind Heav'n to see e're I explain  Correct the false Ambition of my Brain  And on my Mind this Maxim printed be  The Christian Virtue is Humility  Happier the simple Swain the rustic Fool  That never took the Polish of a School  Than swell'd with Pride a Master of all Arts  With  Shaftsbury  's Cunning and with  St John  's Parts  Much Wit obscene has crept thro' ev'ry Age  But Lewdness riots on the modern Stage  O Shame to ArtsOur Poets may defie  The Bards of old with  Rome  and  Athens  vie  May boast Invention Penetration Wit  All Qualities for either  Drama  fit  May touch the Passions with enchanting Art  And take minutest Copies of the Heart  Yet of past Times the Panegyric be  That  Pagan  Wits were better Men than we  Genius  depends then on the Body's Frame  Tell me will  Genius  never be the same  Or will the Diff'rence we to day espy  Subsist in Souls to all Eternity  Such Question put if Reason may be bold  In humble wise Conjecture to unfold  She seems to dictate and she fears not blame  That Things once diff'ring never are the same  Here or hereafter in what Light you will  A Man you know is Soul and Body still  And still corporeal Organs and their Use  Must correspondent Faculties produce  But Body in that happier State refin'd  Shall leave it's old Imfirmities behind  And every Soul be perfect in her  Kind  Consult material Objects and we see  God's Pow'r declar'd by sweet Variety  The diff'rent Seasons diff'rent Beauties bring  'Tis not one Colour paints the jolly Spring  The Sun gay Giant travels in his Might  Smiles from her Orb the placid Queen of Night  Each Insect that eludes the nicest Eye  One of the Myriads floating in the Sky  His Maker's Praise proclaim as loudly can  As Ocean's Tyrant King the Great  Leviathan  Look thro' all Nature the vast Tracts of Space  Each Being has it's proper Pow'r and Place  Th' Angelic Hosts that round the Godhead wait  And issue forth the Ministers of Fate  Have their respective Provinces and know  What Part to act above and what below  Messiah  's Sword to  Michael  's Might is giv'n  And  Gabriel  is Embassador of Heav'n  Hence then from Inf'rence little forc'd we find  That Souls will differ and excel in Kind  But when admitted to the Realms of Joy  What certain Office what precise Employ  Shall exercise the sev'ral Pow'rs of each  Present Conception not presumes to reach  Enough from gen'ral Principles to shew  That one great Point of Bliss will be to know  To touch Perfection in a fav'rite Art  And grieve no longer but to know in Part  To mark where Truth in her Recesses lies  Pursue her without Toil and grasp her as she flies  The Sage  Logician  then shall clearly see  How all Ideas differ or agree  And from her Coverts drive sly Sophistry  No need to shift to wrangle and confute  For sure the Blessed reason not dispute  See pensive  Metaphysics  Science coy  In Contemplation only knowing Joy  Sober Recluse no noisy Stander by  She sits anatomizing Entity  Purg'd of the grosser Particles of Clay  And all material Obstacles away  In the full Vigour of eternal Youth  Oh How will She adore abstracted Truth  Physics  still fond new Secrets to descry  And look thro' Nature with a piercing Eye  Hereafter latent Causes may explore  When all the present System is no more  And prove when Inmate of the blest Abode  The World an Atom to the Works of God  The pale  Astronomer  that kens from far  The station'd Planet or the wand'ring Star  When this frail Earth in Ruin shall be hurl'd  May count the Lamps that light a nobler World  And subtle  Geometry  shall lend her Line  And take Dimensions of the Plan divine  What Sounds shall flow from  Rhetric  's silver Tongue  How sweet her Eloquence her Voice how strong  Her wond'rous Talents graceful She displays  And thunders forth the Heav'nly Monarch's Praise  Hark Hark the raptur'd Bard has struck his Lyre  Blazes aloft the true Poetic Fire  Ten thousand vast Ideas swell his Mind  Imagination ranges unconfin'd  Now softly trills now loudly sounds the Strain  He sings JEHOVAH'S alltriumphant Reign  And Music fills th' unmeasurable Plain  He charms the winged Hosts that hover by  And Spirits shout Applause that rends the Sky  Such then the future Pleasures of the Mind  So solid manly rational refin'd  Productive ever of the truest Joy  And sure to satisfy but not to cloy  How vain at once appear all worldly Schemes  The Tricks of Statesmen and Ambition's Dreams  Low the Designs the wisest Mortals lay  And vile the brutal Pleasures of a Day  Awake awake pursue the proper Plan  Virtue and Knowledge only make a Man  Despise the World a better Fortune try  And calculate for Immortality  Ideots by nat'ral Organs ill supplied  Untutor'd Louts whose parts were never tried  Hereafter hidden Excellence may shew  And rank with Souls that scorn'd them here below  But for the Sot that sees yet slights his Rule  The wilful Novice the industrious Fool  That lulls with Sloth or steeps in Vice his Sense  The Slave of Pleasure or of Indolence  How wretched is his Fate fears he not Pain  The gnawing Viper and the galling Chain  Still wretched is the Blockhead's Fatefor why  Eternal Ignorance is Misery  Who goodly Talents have should Talents use  But still with upright and with virtuous Views  For Application sometimes less pretence  To Merit has than barren Indolence  Nothing fatigues the Soul or tires the Brain  Like Lust of Empire or the Thirst of Gain  And these o'erruling in an active Mind  Spoil Nations and make Havock of Mankind  Ingenious Tyrants only make us Slaves  Were all Men Fools sure no Men would be Knaves  Ambition take the Scepter and the Robe  Spread thy huge Greatness over half the Globe  Lo the World bursts 'Tis Nature's dying Day  The Sun is dark the Planets melt away  Now boast thy  Genius  exercise thy Parts  Recount thy Feats and recognize thy Arts  Alas thou cursest thy too pregnant Brain  And Knowlege is acute to quicken Pain  The Nature the Importance and the End  Of  Genius  such be wise then and attend  How we may best our nat'ral Pow'rs improve  And qualify the Soul for Bliss above  Genius  lies hid like Metal in the Mine  Till searching Education bids it shine  'Tis but a glorious Few of deathless Name  Have found without a Guide their Road to Fame  Nor slight their Province if we justly rate  Who till the Mind and Genius cultivate  Much Penetration and no little Toil  Must try the Strength and Temper of the Soil  Some Minds richnatur'd like a fruitful Field  To little Culture ample Harvests yield  Others assiduous Labour must secure  They owe their goodly Produce to Manure  True Judgment too should mark where Talent lies  And soon as seen indulge Propensities  For diff'rent Objects diff'rent Fancies strike  Genius  we said before is not alike  Pope  's forward Muse procur'd him early Fame  "He lisp'd in Numbers for the Numbers came"  Another's unharmonious Taste is such  Sooner than Poetry he'd learn High Dutch  Yet he peculiar Talents may display  And prove a very Wonder in his Way  Why must all Mortals seek one common Praise  Is there no Garland but a Wreath of Bays  To steep  Parnassus'  Summit most sublime  'Tis not a shortbreath'd  Pegasus  can climb  Yet tho' the panting Jade would fain stand still  The blind  Orbilius  flogs him up the Hill  Some seem to think that  Genius  may be sold  But Wit is not like Honour bought with Gold  To foreign Regions wealthy Idiots roam  Tho' Fools of all Men sure should stay at Home  Another's Heir thro'  Markham  's Forms must pass  He goes a Blockhead and returns an Ass  He gapes he strains he sweats yet gets no higher  For Nature put him down a Country 'Squire  Others of lively Parts but wretched Fate  Want Nothing but a Fortune to be great  Sometimes among the vulgar Herd we find  Strong Marks and Features of a heav'nly Mind  The Village Swain's a Wit he knows not how  And I have seen Philosophy at Plough  How are our Hopes by present Chances crost  What Oafs make Psns and what Wits are lost  When now your  Genius  near to Ripeness grown  Begins to glow with Raptures all it's own  Ply it with chosen Books of various Kinds  For Reading is the Food of hungry Minds  Mod'rate and wholsom will suffice your Need  'Tis not how much but how and what you read  To rise with Appetite is always best  Gluttons devour much more than they digest  'Tis vain for ever over Books to pore  Reading does much but Meditation more  Mere slavish Plodding never yet prevail'd  See yon lank Student to his Folio nail'd  He reads at Home Abroad at Meals in Bed  And has five thousand Volumes in his Head  Yet little to Perfection has be brought  For he has read so much he never thought  The Youth more sprightly and the glowing Bard  That had as lief go dig as study hard  Applies by Fits and at his Fancy's Call  Little he reads but has that little all  He sees and he enjoys his Author's Worth  Gathers his Flow'rs and culls his Beauties forth  He dwells with Transport on a favourite Part  And clasps each striking Passage to his Heart  Your Models chuse from Authors of first Rate  He cannot write who dares not emulate  To Father  Homer  's sovereign Poetry  Rome  owes her  Virgil  and our  Milton  we  High as the tow'ring Strains of  Pindar  soar  Great  Flaccus  was what  Pindar  was before  For present Times to emulate is all  'Tis not in Wit to be original  Leave Booksand go to Company and then  Leave Company and go to Books again  The studious Mind 'tis useful to unbend  In pleasing Converse with a social Friend  For cordial Juices of the generous Vine  Refresh the Weary and the Dull refine  O'er flowing Bowls rebounds the sparkling Wit  And sure no Poet was a Milksop yet  Intemp'rate Revelling alone consumes  The vital Pow'rs and clouds the Brain in Fumes  Horace  expertest Handler of the Lyre  In rich  Falernum  quaff'd poetic Fire  A jovial Bard How pleasant are his Strains  How much Goodhumour in his Writings reigns  He laughs tho' angry and will still delight  His Verse is Satyr but it is not Spight  How does his Muse with free Politeness rail  While  Juvenal  's is thrashing with a Flail  Scholars should know all Fire in Motion lies  And whet their Parts with manly Exercise  Dullness sits slumb'ring in an Elbow chair  But the gay Muses love to take the Air  The Shades of Night are fled before the Morn  The Mountains echoe to the chearful Horn  Men Dogs and Horses Neighings Shouts and Cries  Shake with tumultuous Jollity the Skies  The Chace begins they pant in every Vein  Now climb the Hill's steep Brow then scour along the Plain  Such Sports as these enliven they impart  Warmth to the Brain and Gladness to the Heart  But if due Aid to  Genius  may be lent  Much too it suffers by Impediment  Unhappy is the Bard that deals in Rhyme  When Wit is obsolete and Sense a Crime  When the weak Muse in a degen'rate Age  Crawls from the Press or lamely treads the Stage  No longer dares to noble Heights advance  But chimes in Song or trifles in Romance  Infected by false Taste great Souls we see  Who  Rdn  can Nature paint like thee  Yet would a Genius toy as thou hast done  And spin Morality like  Grandison  How shall the genuine Bard escape from Fools  That judge by narrow or by partial Rules  A thousand Witlings maul his mangled Name  And yelping Critics hunt him out of Fame  Nay Censure so perversly plays her Tricks  That she will Measure Wit by  Politicks  And some with hollow Heads but Faces big  Will almost swear APOLLO is a WHIG  Men of true Genius and of real Use  Can  Oxford  that vile  Nazareth  produce  And yet

Follies and foulstain'd with Crimes  When Vice gigantic takes her public Stand  And bids Corruption deluge all the Land  Sculks now no more in Holes from Place to Place  But stares astonish'd Virtue in the Face  When Chiefs blaspheme the God for whom they fight  And all Religion is to be polite  In such a Day as this secure to steer  With spotless Honour from Contagion clear  To cherish still the dying patriot Fire  Unaw'd by Menace and unbought by Hire  To own and to defend the Christian Name  And fix on Infidels the Mark of Shame  Is the first Point of Praise and let the Nine  Sound with their Harps this Praise fair  Oxford  thine  'Tis not a minor Bard can hope to please  And struggle thro' Discouragements like these  For ever sure must damp poetick Rage  False Taste loose Manners and a slavish Age  If these are Plagues still more remain behind  Wits tell you Fortune frowns upon their Kindâ–ª  Alas What Sources of Obstruction lie  In the great common Woe of Poverty  Whose Case is hardest 'tis not quickly said  Or theirs that work or theirs that write for Bread  The starveling Curate the fat Dean supplies  One makes Divinity and t'other buys  How sinks the needy Wretch beneath himself  That sells his Parts to ministerial Pelf  Yet such for State Necessities are fit  For nothing helps a Villain out like Wit  Sure of all Writers Poets should not lack  'Twill spoil

Censure of an able Friend  Procure the Sanction of a learned Few  Who knows what Mortals may your Works  review  True Modesty for Wit may sometimes pass  But every Coxcomb is as such an Ass  The best

confounded  AN ESSAY ON THE ANTIENT and MODERN DRAMA OCCASIONED BY M  R  MASON's ELFRIDA And the LETTERS Prefixed to it  AN ESSAY ON THE ANTIENT and MODERN DRAMA  I Have often read with much Pleasure the ingenious Mr  Mason  's  Dramatic Poem  entitled  Elfrida  together with the preparatory  Letters  with which that Gentleman introduces it to the Public This Piece is professedly written on the Model of the antient  Greek Tragedy  and though I flatter myself the Objections I have to the Principles laid down in those  Letters  are not removed by this muchlabour'd Attempt yet I will readily own the Design is executed with a skilful hand and in some respects deserves the Attention of the present Writers of the  English Drama  I did not therefore undertake this Argument with any Inclination to differ from a Person of his known  Taste and greatly admired Abilities but purely in Vindication of the Theory I have had the Honour to deliver in a Course of  Lectures  to the UNIVERSITY of OXFORD in which with a particular View to the Justification of  Shakespeare  I have ventured to advance and defend a System in some material Points inconsistent with that under present Consideration Neither am I unaware of the great Disadvantage I have to contend against when I oppose a celebrated Writer whose Sentiments are countenanc'd by the Practise of the antient Poets and whose Pen is drawn under the Banner of  Aristotle  himself A Disadvantage which the Usage of later Writers and the almost concurrent Voice of modern Criticism  By modern Criticism I mean that Plan upon which the  English Drama  had been form'd for a Course of many Generations and which Mr  Mason  and other Critics and Poets have in our Days attempted both by Precept and Example to supersede and explode in favour of the Antient System  perhaps will be thought little enough to counterbalance However as in Matters of Taste we ought only I apprehend to appeal to the genuine Dictates of Goodsense Reason and Nature which an implicit Veneration for any Name Antient or Modern may possibly prevent our regarding so if Prejudices on both Sides were removed it would probably appear that the Victory is rather to be divided than determined and that without depreciating the real Merit and Excellency  of the antient Poets we may yet safely defend the Principles on which the Moderns reject their Writings as the absolute and everlasting Standard of  Dramatic  Composition I mean principally with regard to the three great Unities of Action Time and PlaceWhat I have to say therefore upon these Subjects I submit without farther Apology to the Judgment of the intelligent and impartial Reader advertising him only in this Place that he is not to expect a Methodical Treatise of elaborate Criticism but only a Train of occasional Thoughts and Reflections as they occur'd to me upon the Perusal of the Poem of  Elfrida  and the  Letters  prefix'd to it  Had I intended says Mr  Mason  in his first Letter for I chuse to repeat his own Words to prevent Misapprehension to give an exact Copy of the antient  Drama  your objections to the present Poem would be unanswerable But my design was much less confin'd I meant only to pursue the antient Method so far as is probable a Greek Poet were he alive would now do in order to adapt himself to the Genius of our Times and the Character of our Tragedy According to this Notion every Thing was to be allow'd to the present Taste which Nature and  Aristotle  could possibly dispense with and nothing of Intrigue or refinement was to be admitted at which antient Judgment could reasonably  take Offence Good Sense as well as Antiquity prescribed an adherence to the three great Unities these therefore were strictly observed  'Tis evident from this Passage the ingenious Author would have us consider the Laws of  Aristotle  and the Practice of Antiquity relating to the great Unities as manifestly founded in the first Principles of Nature and Good Sense and accordingly in order to adapt himself to the present Taste no farther than might be justly allowable we find him deviating from the Rules and Practice of Antiquity but in two Instances First in the Choice of a Story in which Love is the predominant Passion and Secondly in which Characters are represented as nearly approaching to private ones as  Tragic  Dignity would permit Upon our Author's  Hypothesis  indeed these are perhaps almost the only Deviations that could be allow'd him and the Point must at once be given up if the Theory be true which is here in so positive a manner advanc'd For Satisfaction therefore in this Matter it may be useful in the first Place to observe that the Action of the antient  Drama  when brought to the Perfection in which  Aristotle  found it was so strictly One and the Fable so absolutely Simple and almost totally abhorrent from Incident at least from what Mr  Mason  calls Contrivance Refinement and Intrigue  that the Constitution of the  Drama  did not so properly require as suppose and imply a correspondent Unity of Time and Place Nay usually we find among the antient  Greek  Poets the entire Action of the  Drama  was brought within the Compass of the Representation itself And indeed if  exact  Nature and  strict  Propriety are indispensably to be the Objects of the  Dramatic  Poet's Attention upon all Occasions this must be allow'd to be the most perfect Model of  Tragedy  and consequently  Aristotle  himself seems to have indulg'd the  Tragic  Muse too far when in conformity with the sometime Practice of the  Greek Poets  He has prescrib'd a Day as the due and regular Boundary of all  Dramatic  Action For certainly a Day cannot really be compriz'd within the Space of five Hours any more than a Year or any precise Duration whatsoever The Truth is Poetry was the Mother of Criticism not Criticism of Poetry and accordingly this great Philosopher form'd his simple Notions and Rules upon the best Plan of the  Drama  then extant but I cannot think it will by any Means follow that those Rules are in all Points of perpetual and necessary Obligation For why was it not in itself as agreeable to Nature and Reason for the Poets to admit Contrivance and Policy Design and Intrigue into the Constitution of the Fable as it could possibly be to confine themselves to the  Representation of the most simple and uniform Action especially as they hereby improv'd and heighten'd that Perplexity and Distress which are the great Sources of Delight in Dramatic Entertainment I say this Latitude of Design is not in itself unreasonable or unnatural because 'tis not to be dissembled that the Liberty contended for would indeed be as it has been in the Hands of the unskilful and injudicious an Inlet to Confusion and Absurdity However it will not surely be denied that there is in Fact a very material Difference between Incidents and the Variety of Designs and Contrivances that occasion them and mere Bustle and  Business  in his contempt of which Word Mr  Mason  seems willing to involve the whole System of  Dramatic  Intrigue The general Theory I would therefore advance is this for I would not be understood to assert it admits of no Exception that it is not barely the Privilege but often even the Duty of the  Dramatic  Poet to adapt himself to the Vicissitudes of Public Taste and to represent human Life and human Actions as he finds them and if in Pursuance of this Design he may think it expedient to make Choice of a Subject of such a complicated Nature as cannot with Ease and Consistency be dispatch'd within the  statutable  Limits of Time and Place I cannot see why we may not indulge him with a proportionable Allowance of each in order to  prevent infinitely greater Absurdities and Inconsistencies than that Allowance can possibly produce that is those confus'd and precipitate Action And all this while the Extensiveness of the Design provided it be executed with Judgment in other Respects deserves rather to be look'd upon as an Excellence and an Improvement upon the old Model than to be placed to the Account either of the Ignorance or the Inattention of the Writer of which more hereafter  There is that Sovereign Quality in Poetry to use the Words of the ingenious Author of the  Notes on the Epistle to Augustus  which the Poet  Horace  in the following passage  Ille per extensum funem mihi posse videtur  Ire Poeta meum qui pectus inaniter angit  Irritat mulcet falsis terroribus implet  Ut Magnus et modo me Thebis modo ponit Athenis  considers as a kind of  magic virtue  which transports the Spectator into all Places and makes him occasionally assume all Persons The Resemblance holds also in this that it's effects are instantaneous and irresistible  Rules Art Decorum  all fall before it It goes directly to the Heart and gains all purposes at once Hence it is that speaking of a real Genius possessed of this commanding Power  Horace  in the Lines above quoted  Ille per extensum  c pronounces him emphatically  The Poet  it being more especially this Property which of itself discovers the  true Dramatist  and secures the success of his performance not only without the assistance of  Art  but in direct Opposition to it's clearest Dictates  This Passage which I have quoted  verbatim  abating a few Expressions in it exactly coincides with my sentiment upon this Head and the Application which the Author makes of it in Favour of  Corneille  may I presume be made with equal Propriety at least in Behalf of our  Shakespeare  I am sensible all this while that this great Prince and Father of the English  Stage  is supposed by Mr  Mason  to have shewn a total Disregard of all the Rules of the  Drama  in Compliance merely with the Taste of the Times I must own I could have been glad to have seen fewer Things  supposed  upon this Subject I will take the Liberty likewise to  suppose  that this great Poet saw no legal or necessary Restraint upon the Force and Impetuosity of his Genius with Regard to the Unities of Action Time and Place that he considered the Laws relating to them as merely local and temporary well adapted indeed to the simple Genius of antient  Tragedy  but in themselves and the Reason of Things dispensable upon the Supposition of a  Dramatic  Plan of a more extensive and complicated Nature His Opinion might be like the  current one mentioned in Mr  Mason  's second  Letter  that  the strict Adherence to the Unities restrains the Genius of the Poet by the Simplicity of it's Conduct diminishes the Pathos of the Fable and by the Admission of a continued Chorus prevents that agreeable Embarrass which awakens our Attention and interests our Passions  However that the Nature of  Dramatic  Poetry will not only admit of a more extensive Model than the  Tragedies  of the  Greek  Poets furnish us with but is also improveable by the same if it cannot be proved may at least I think be inferr'd even from the Doctrine of  Aristotle  himself This great Critic it is very well known calls the  Fable  the  Soul  of  Tragedy  with a manifest Eye to which Expression Mr  Dryden  observes that  Aristotle  places the  Fable  first  non quoad  Dignitatem  sed quoad  Fundamentum  And indeed we need only refer the Reader to the simple Arguments of  Aeschylus  and even of  Euripides  and  Sophocles  for the most part too to convince him that the  Fable  upon the antient Plan of the  Drama  cannot properly be said to be the  Soul  of the Poem in any other Sense than as it is the  Subject  of it Nay this is in a great Measure the Case even of those antient  Tragedies  which are of the  implex  Kind and as such esteemed most excellent by our Philosopher One main Argument used by him for the Priority  of the  Fable  in the constituent Parts of  Tragedy  is taken from the Consideration of the sudden  Revolutions  and  Discoveries  the  See Arist Poet Chap  as he calls them which distinguish the  Tragedies  we are speaking of from those of the simplest Kind These are the means says he by which  Tragedy  more particularly captivates and engages  the Mind and Affections  Now if this Doctrine be applied to the modern  Drama  it seems to me not only an Apology for but in Effect a Recommendation of the Incidents and Revolutions which are infinitely more numerous upon the  British  Stage than they were upon that of  Athens  and are so offensive to squeamish Judgments unless it can be proved that these under the Direction of a good Judgment do not contribute to or rather constitute that Variety which  Aristotle  plainly refers to in the Passage quoted or that such Variety in modern Plays has not a proportionable Influence on the Passions upon which as Mr  Mason  rightly has observed it is the Business of the  Tragic  Muse "directly to strike"If therefore the  Fable  be the  Soul  of  Tragedy  I will venture to assert there is more  Soul  in a good modern  Tragedy  than in the best antient one and that Mr  Dryden  might very properly and therefore gravely call secret  Intrigues the  Beauties of our modern Stage  Indeed that great Man in some occasional Remarks he made on Mr  Rymer  's Reflections on the  Tragedies  of  Fletcher  c makes no scruple to give the Preference to our  English  Poets before the  Antients  under this very Article of Enquiry  Next shew says he in what Antient  Tragedy  was deficient for Example in the Narrowness of it's Plots and Fewness of Persons and try whether that be not a Fault in the  Greek  Poets and whether their Excellency was so great when the Variety was visibly so little or whether what they did was not very easy to be done  In Opposition to this the following Words of the ingenious Author of the  Notes  c already referred to may possibly be urged  An Unity says he speaking of the two  Dramas  and even  Simplicity in the Conduct of the Fable is a Perfection in each  For the Course of the  Affections  is diverted and weakened by the Intervention of what we call a  double Plot  and even by a Multiplicity of  subordinate Events  though tending to a common  End  and of  Persons  though all of them some Way concerned in promoting it The like Consideration shews the Observance of this  Rule  to be essential in just Comedy For when the  Attention  is split on so many interfering Objects we are not at leisure to observe nor do we fully  enter into the  Truth of Representation  in any of them the  Sense  of  Humour  as of the  Pathos  depending very much on the continued and undiverted Operation of it's  Object  upon us  But in answer to this I will venture to assert in my Turn that the Intervention of what we call a  DoublePlot  a  competent Number  not  Multiplicity  of  subordinate Events  tending to a common  End  and of  Persons  all of them some way concern'd in promoting it do not weaken but ease and relieve the Course of the  Affections  and also that in  Comedy  the Attention is really quicken'd even by being split on so many interfering Objectsthat different and  opposite Characters  set off and illustrate  each other  and that we are enabled by a proper  Variety  of Personages more precisely to observe and fully to enter into The  Truth of Representation  in  all  of them And consequently that a  Comedy  with a DoublePlot artfully conducted and fill'd judiciously not cramm'd with Incidents and Intrigue in which the several Persons of the  Drama  have room to exercise and display themselves attains it's End which is the Rotation of  Characters  and their  specific Differences  as this Author well observes more effectually than the simple and contracted  Comedy  of the Antients but this Matter I have handled more at large  See Lectures  elsewhere and in the mean time  let these respective Opinions be left to the Decision of Fact and ExperienceTo return to Mr  Mason  I should be loth indeed to see Incidents Bustle and Business supply the Place of Simplicity Nature and Pathos  which 'tis not to be denied is the Case in some modern Performances But that the former are likewise very consistent with the latter and that such Consistency and Union is one great Point of  Dramatic  Composition as calculated for the rational Entertainment of an Audience may be exemplified in many illustrious Instances particularly in the  Tragedies  of  Shakespear  It is true this inimitable Poet is not so greatly remarkable for Depth of Plot and Intricacy of Contrivance as for the Historical Continuation of his Design which by the way is indeed carried to an unreasonable Length in some of his Plays but however as such Historical Continuation necessarily implies a great Variety of Incidents and Revolutions it is fairly reducible to the same Head of Disquisition  Shakespear  indeed for the most part form'd his Dramatic Plans from History or Romance and therefore has no extraordinary Claim to the Glory of Invention either as to the Subject of his  Tragedies  or the Conduct of his Plots His Excellencies for the most part are purely Poetical But this is far from being the Case of all our  Dramatic  Writers The  Groundwork of the greatest part of our  English Tragedies  is indeed Historical but the Superstructure is their own The whole Business of Plot Intrigue and Contrivance is generally the Work of the Poets and a Work when executed with Art and Judgment that shews them to be superiour at least to their Forefathers of  Greece  in the ample Field of Invention the first Point in Poetry and therefore I should think some of Mr  Mason  's Expressions relating to the kind Assistance of the Violin to the Distress of the Hero or the Poet on the  British  Stage may in some measure be retorted upon himself and those whose Cause he espouses For though an intermediate Space between the Acts may be requisite for the Purposes of the Modern  Drama  and even to save Appearances of the Probability of the Design yet I can by no means admit these prudential Pauses to be Proofs in themselves of the Distress or Barrenness of the Writer Methinks to the Relief of these the antient  Chorus  seems more peculiarly adapted when the  Drama  by reason of the Scantiness or if you please  Simplicity  of it's Matter and the Narrowness of it's Plots stood in absolute Need of such seasonable and friendly Interposition But to the  Chorus  I am to pay my Compliments again by and by  It should be observ'd here I am supposing all this while that notwithstanding the Extensiveness  of Design in modern  Tragedies  a due and even scrupulous Regard is to be had to Consistency and Uniformity of Plot and Action That there is to be but one grand central Point as it were in which the several Underplots Incidents Turns and Vicissitudes of the  Drama  are finally to terminate and that though the great Business of the Poet under this Article be to perplex and embarrass his Audience and to play with their Passions at pleasure yet he is to take Care that the Unravelling of the whole and the several Parts be easy and natural and the Labyrinths of his Plots such as according to Mr  Addison  's Expression upon another Occasion may be justly deem'd a  regular Confusion  If proper Care and Caution be taken as to these particulars I confess I am apt to look upon the Transgression of the Letter of the old Laws of  Tragedy  as Offences rather against the Custom and Usage of Antiquity than the Dictates of Reason and Nature and as great a Veneration as I have for the antient Poets cannot possibly think I am maintaining an Argument to the prejudice of their real Merit by endeavouring to assert the Liberty of modern Poets and to rescue the  Drama  from  Aristotle  's  See Mr Mason's Third Letter  Magna Charta  of  Restraint  To speak freely I must own farther I cannot subscribe to a Theory that condemns at one Dash  almost every Compliance with Public Taste and the Genius of a People as mere Complaisance and Servility I believe a  Greek  Poet now alive would adapt himself to the Taste of the Times in more Instances than Mr  Mason  would allow and that these have been occasionally more or less consulted and indulged by all Poets in all Ages Not that I am of Mr  Southern  's Opinion See his Preface to the  Fatal Marriage  that every reasonable Man will and ought to govern in the Pleasures he pays for for in such Case  Hamlet  must walk off the Stage to make room for  Harlequin  I would neither servilely indulge Public Taste nor yet selfsufficiently despise itI am willing upon this Occasion once more to shelter myself under the Authority of  Dryden  One reason of that Success says he in the abovecited Remarks is in my Opinion this that  Shakespear  and  Fletcher  have written to the Genius of the Age and Nation in which they lived For though Nature as he Mr  Rymer  objects is the same in all Places and Reason too the same yet the Climate the Age the Dispositions of the People to whom a Poet writes may be so different that what pleas'd the  Greeks  would not satisfy an  English  Audience  And if they proceeded upon a Foundation of truer Reason to please the  Athenians  than  Shakespear  and  Fletcher  to please the  English  it only shows that the  Athenians  were a more judicious People But the Poet's Business is certainly to please the Audience  Whether our  English  Audience have been pleased hitherto with Acorns as he calls it or with Bread is the next Question that is whether the Means which  Shakespear  and  Fletcher  have used in their Plays to raise those Passions beforenamed be better applied to the Ends by the  Greek  Poets than by them and perhaps we shall not grant him this wholly Let it be yielded that a Writer is not to run down with the Stream or to please the People by their own usual Methods but rather to  +form form their Judgments it still remains to be proved that our Theatre needs this total ReformationThe Faults which he h  s found in their Designs are rather wittily aggravated in many Places than reasonably urg'd and as much may be returned on the  Greeks  by one who were as witty as himelf  Mr  Dryden  is here compa  ng the Ancients with the Moderns in regard to the Conduct and Command of the two great  Tragical  Passions Pity and Terrour and the Comparison concludes to the Advantage of the latter  A little farther he proceeds thus  To conclude thereore if the Plays of the Ancients are  more correctly plotted ours are more beautifully written and if we can raise Passions as high on worse Foundations it shews our Genius in Tragedy is greater for in all other Parts of it the  English  have manifestly excelled them  For the Fable itself 'tis in the  English  more adorned with  Episodes  and larger than in the  Greek  Poets consequently more diverting for if the Action be but one and that plain without any Counterturn of Design or Episode i e Underplot how can it be so pleasing as that of the  English  which have both Underplot and a turn'd Design which keeps the Audience in Expectation of the Catastrophe w  ereas in the  Greek  Poets we see through the who  Design at first  I do lot use this as an accurate Piece of Criticism nor would be understood to oppose the Authority of Mr  Dryden  to the  Ipse dixit  of  Aristotle  in general who has certainly a right to be heard first in critical as well as philosophical Matters with a proportionable Consideration of the Age he lived in The only Point in Debate is whether he can be supposed in the Nature of Things from the clear Idea he had form'd of the  Greek Drama  to be qualified to give Poetical Laws to all PosterityPublic Taste it is probable as Mr  Dryden  intimates  ries in different  Countries according to the Nature of the Climate and the Constitution of the People However there are some certain fix'd and acknowledged Principles of Good Sense Nature and Reason that are as Mr  Rymer  observes equally and universally in all Ages and Nations at least all civilized ones the same I believe there has been hardly any Age so illiterate whimsical or corrupted in this Sense as to explode these standing Principles such for Instance among many others are the following That the  Drama  is to be the true Image and Representation of Nature That this Representation can only be exhibited under an infinite Variety of Actions Designs Characters Manners Sentiments and Expressions That with regard to all and each of these Propriety Consistency and Probability are most exactly to be observed That the Motives to all Actions the Springs of all Passions the Grounds of all Prejudices the Peculiarities of all Tempers have one common Foundation and are productive of their correspondent Effects in all Times and PlacesThe Knowlege of these Things is the Knowlege of Nature in which the great  Arcana  of all Poetry and particularly  Dramatic  are reposited To these therefore it is the  Dramatic  Poets Care most heedfully to attend and to these he may attend in Fact very consistently with a Disregard of the Laws of the old  Drama  as might be instanced in many of our best Modern Plays and in almost all of  Shakespear  'sIt is indeed nothing but this Attention that has so eminently raised and preserved the Reputation of these latter notwithstanding the Poet's absolute Neglect or rather Defiance of the great Unities contended for as essential to the  Drama  And 'tis as certain that where this Attention is wanting either through Ignorance or Carelessness the most regular Observance of these Unities will be found utterly insufficient for the true Purposes of StagePoetry  For these and the like Reasons I think one may venture to conclude that the Practice of the Antients is by no means a necessary Standard of  Dramatic  writing and that the Laws relating to the several Unities of Action Time and Place though they do indeed constitute a particular Form or Species of the  Drama  and we will grant the most  exact  too yet are by no means essential to the Nature of it Whatever is so cannot be violated or infringed without Contradiction to the common Judgment of Mankind and disgusting at least the more rational Part of an Audience And accordingly every Defect in the Particulars abovementioned is always received with proportionable Marks of Disapprobation But the Case is quite different in respect of the Liberties  Shakespear  has taken which  therefore I can never think absurd or unnatural in themselves And I am the more confirmed in this Opinion because  Johnson Fletcher  and many others who were confessedly acquainted with the Genius of ancient  Tragedy  and generally speaking not only affected Art and Regularity in their Writings but even depended principally upon these for the Success of them did nevertheless on many Occasions hold themselves free from the Obligation of the Laws at present in Question  But herein our modern Refiners will say they judged wrong and as to  Shakespear  if he has escaped the Severity of Censure upon this Head it must be ascribed wholly to that Complaisance which every Generation has thought due to his Excellencies in the  higher Beauties  of PoetryNow this Answer and something to this Effect must be the Answer does itself suppose that the most punctual Observance of the old Laws has no Connection with the  great  Beauties of Poetry but is only at best the  mechanical  Part of the  Drama  However 'tis presum'd that the great Name of  Shakespear  scorns to be protected by the Complaisance of his Countrymen and that the Liberties he has taken are very far from being indefensibleFor is it more improper and irrational or does it require less Force of of Genius and Knowlege of Nature to trace as  it were a Passion from it's first Rise through it's Progress and to it's final Issue as that of Jealousy in  Othello  or of Ambition in  Macbeth  than to represent it only at a stated Period and at a particular Crisis Or if the Poet thinks proper to shift the Scene from a  Palace  to a  Heath  or from  Venice  to  Cyprus  is it at all more inconvenient or impossible for his Audience to attend him than it was to give him the Meeting and suppose themselves in the Place where he laid his first Scene It does not at all appear to me that a greater Degree of implicit Faith is required in one Instance than in the other For he may with equal Probability do both UT MAGUS as has been hinted above and he can do neither but in Quality of the same Times and Places are in a great Measure at the Command of a Genius and the Argument drawn from the absolute Unnaturalness of every Breach of exact and precise Unity with regard to them if it proves any Thing proves too much it will prove the Unnaturalness of the whole  Dramatic Apparatus  it will demonstrate the Impossibility of exhibiting Woods Fields Castles and Towns in a single Room and the Absurdity of giving an Ear to a Company of Fidlers before or after the Solemnity of a Council or the Tumult of a Battle In short it seems to me a most ridiculous  Hypercriticism  to object to Improprieties which are more or less  inseparable from the Constitution of the  Drama  and to talk of Inconsistencies and Impossibilities where all is confessedly a Delusion If the Question indeed were whether of the two be the more  artificial  Model of Tragedy that of the Ancients or the Moderns I would make no Scruple to give up the Argument But a  regular  and  exact  Model is one Thing and an  excellent Play  is another it is one Thing to allow a reasonable Latitude to a great Genius and another to prescribe a Plan to a common Poet  Were the antient  Greek Tragedians  defective then in Point of Genius it will be ask'd Very far from itHowever I will venture to assert that the  Simplicity  I had almost said  Poverty  of their Fables is by no means their striking Beauty that these would have appeared to greater Advantage had they taken greater Liberties that neither Nature nor Reason restrained them to the precise Observation of the three Unities and that the Custom of Antiquity in this Case under the Abilities of a great Master would to use the Words of  Shakespear  be more frequently  honoured in the Breach than the Observance  But what if after all some Precedents even from Antiquity itself will in a certain Measure warrant the Nonobservance of the great Rules in Dispute  Euripides  and  Sophocles  who confessedly improved the more simple Plan of their Predecessor  Aeschylus  and are supposed to have brought the  Drama  to it's State of Perfection do not superstitiously and without Exception adhere to their own general System Witness first the  Hecuba  of  Euripides  in which there are apparently two distinct and almost unconnected Actions at least out of the two great Incidents of that Tragedy two distinct Actions might have been plan'd for either the Death of  Polixena  or the Destruction of  Polymnestor  might and  strictly  speaking ought to have been the simple Subject of that  Drama  If it be said that both these Actions or Incidents were no more than were sufficient or necessary to exemplify the Distresses of  Hecuba  and to illustrate the Character of that unhappy Princess this is saying in effect what we have already said in Defence of the complicated Plan of modern  Dramatists  and so  Hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim  Again the  Ajax  of  Sophocles  ought to have ended with it's natural Catastrophe the Death of this Hero instead of which another Action properly speaking commences arising from the violent Contest between  Teucer  and  Agamemnon  concerning the forementioned Hero's Right of Burial a Contest which if the Poet in the present Case had studied or even regarded absolute Simplicity and Uniformity he should have reserved for the Groundwork of another TragedyAnd further  the  Trachiniae  of the same excellent Author is manifestly defective in Point of Unity of Time of which much more must naturally be supposed to have lapsed between the Departure of  Hyllus  to inquire after his Father and his Return to  Trachin  than the Letter of the  Dramatic  Law allowed himThese Defects and Irregularities I have never seen taken Notice of and much less objected to these justly admired Writers And though we could bring no other Examples to the same Purpose than the above cited or however none so obvious as these yet 'tis apprehended a single Instance of this Nature is of very considerable Weight and Consequence in the present Controversy and will warrant us in determining that the strict Laws of the  Drama  were not of indispensable Obligation even in the Judgment of the Antients themselvesIndeed if they are the Merit of a Poet should be tried chiefly at least by them and therefore when Mr  Mason  tells us that  Shakespear  ought for his other Virtues to be exempted from common Rules he is unjustifiably candid and indulgent to him for sure he ought by no Means to be exempted if such Rules are founded in the indispensable Laws and first Principles of Nature and good Sense If he is fundamentally and essentially ridiculous a thousand inferiour Beauties will not excuse him Common Rules are therefore upon certain important Considerations dispensable and if so  Shakespear  's Beauties do not so properly excuse as acquit him  If the judicious Reader will apply here by the Way some of the foregoing Remarks to the Case of  TragiComedy  he will be able perhaps to account not only for the Toleration but also gracious Reception of so motley a Production upon the  English  Stage For though  Shakespear  with his Contemporaries and many Successors did in such Pieces undeniably humour the public Taste to their own Discredit yet 'tis to be observed that the grand  Arcana  of Nature above intimated might be scrupulously attended to even in this heterogeneous Composition and accordingly when the  Tragic  and  Comic  Representation was each excellent in it's Kind it is no Wonder that the Bulk of an Audience should overlook the manifest Impropriety of the Coalition or that the more judicious Part should forgive it for the Sake of the fundamental and essential Excellencies of the respective Actions and Representations It is plainly for this Reason that the best  TragiComedies  of  Shakespear  and others are received with general Applause at this very Day the Ground of Complaint against such  Tragic  and  Comic  Union being really not so much that it offends the Judgment as that it improperly divides the Attention Two separate Plots and distinct Actions do this to a ridiculous Degree but in one and the same Action absolute Uniformity is not essential either to the  Tragic  or  Comic Drama  For tho' the  Pathos  be the Characteristic of  Tragedy  and  Humour  of  Comedy  as well ancient as modern yet the former will admit of Characters of Pleasantry under certain Regulations and the latter is frequently known to abound with Circumstances of very affecting tho' domestic Distress of which many Instances might if need were be on both sides produced in the several  Dramas  both of Antients and Moderns Nor does such occasional and moderate Reciprocation confound or destroy the different Genius Nature and End of the two  Species  And it was probably owing to some injudicious Writer's Misapplication of this Truth and his drawing undue and false Consequences from it and even in his own Imagination improving it that either the Name or the Constitution of  TragiComedy  did ever subsist For the Reasons why  Plautus  calls his  Amphitrion  a  TragiComedy  are of a Nature entirely different from this However the great Objection to this Form of  Dramatic  Composition is certainly as has been said that it unsuitably divides the Attention not that it lessens it or by exciting many different Passions in the same Space of Time checks the Force of any single one That the Attention in a very uniform and regular Play may be divided without being lessened we have already observed and indeed if this were not the Case absolute Uniformity and Simplicity must be really essential to  the two  Species  of the  Drama  and every reciprocal Participation will be proportionably to the Degree of it absurd But to assert this would be talking against Reason Experience and the not uncommon Practice of the best Poets Is any Man less mov'd by the Delicacy and Tenderness of Lord  Townley  upon his Separation from his Wife on Account of the Mirth that was before excited in him by the ridiculous Ignorance and Rusticity of Sir  Francis Wronghead  Do we less interest ourselves in the Fate of the unhappy  Indiana  because we were diverted by the coxcombical Pertness of Mr  Thomas  Should we be more affected by the pathetical Complaints of  Romeo  if they were not contrasted in the Buffoonery of  Mercutio  Or to refer the Reader to a Play or two written directly upon the  Tragicomic  Plan does the iniquitous Drollery of the  Spanish Friar  abate our Concern for the Distresses of  Torrismond  and  Leonora  Or do the comical  Rhodomontades  and Humours of  Falstaff  and his Associates take off our Attention from the Bravery of Prince  Henry  or  Hotspur  c c at the Battle of  Shrewsbury  I am very far from contending for this Mixture not of opposite but indeed contradictory Characters in the same  Drama  and much less for the Form of  TragiComedy  itself Proper and due Uniformity admits of sufficient Variety and though it be not essential to the  Drama  is no doubt a great Beauty in it The most popular of the Plays I have mentioned are not the better for their Medley of Characters but all this while let the Fault or Impropriety be placed in a fair Light and ascrib'd to it's true Cause which is the real though nice Connection between the Genius of  Tragedy  and that of  Comedy  and the extreme Difficulty of precisely determining how far or in what Degrees and Proportions the one may assume the Qualities and Properties of the other  But to return to my SubjectThe simple Constitution of the ancient  Drama  has indeed some Advantages over the more complicated one of succeeding Ages but still such as are abundantly more than ballanc'd by those of the latter The frequent shifting of Scenes for Instance though it does not offend the Judgment is yet disgusting to the Eye of the Spectator and so far the Continuation of one and the same Scene is a peculiar Beauty and Propriety But all this while to this Beauty and local Propriety many other more important Points of Probability are too often sacrific'd This is more or less I believe the Case of all strictly uniform  Tragedies  and  Comedies  but evidently at least of some of our best  English Comedies  that have been written on the old  Dramatic  Plan in which notwithstanding the Unity of Action so much Business is  transacted so much Intrigue carried on by so many different Personages in one single Spot of Ground as is utterly incredible in which Case the Poet  really  offends against Reason Nature and good Sense purely to save the  Appearance  of doing so Indeed if the Unities are essential to the  Drama  the utmost Simplicity will of Course be a Perfection in it and consequently many of the most regular Compositions of our  Comic  Poets as  the Way of the World  and the  Double Dealer  of  Congreve  will be found to be infinitely their worst Productions So ambitious have some been of improving the Model of the antient  Drama  and yet so cautious at the same Time of taking such Liberties as were absolutely necessary for those Improvements  After all Discretion is to be a general Rule even in the Use of Liberty I would neither fetter the  Dramatic  Muse nor yet let her run wild Deviations from the strict Laws of Antiquity should be made not affectedly and at random but with a View to Beauties of a higher Nature not for the Ease of the Poet but to the Advantage of the Poem I would not vindicate  Shakespear  himself in every Instance of his Transgression To sum up all that need be said upon this Point in a few Words the old Laws of  Aristotle  are in my Opinion very proper Regulations and Restraints for an indifferent Poet but ought not to be the Shackles of a good one  The other great Point of Difference between the antient and modern  Drama  is the Disuse of the  Chorus  in the latter which yet Mr  Mason  is "willing to think essential to the Tragic  Drama"  Now admitting the Theory of  Aristotle  and Mr  Mason  to be not only a regular but also necessary Standard of  Dramatic  Writings with Respect to the Unities of Action Time and Place the  Chorus  though not essential to the  Drama  will indeed as Mr  Mason  observes  lay a proper and necessary Restraint upon the Poet  But if these Unities themselves are far from being essential to the  Drama  as we have endeavoured to make it appear the Use of the  Chorus  is so far at least supersededThe  Chorus  was indeed as I have before observed not only a constituent Part of but even a Convenience to the antient  Tragedy  If I might be excused the Indelicacy of the Expression for the Significancy of the Sentiment I would say let a  Tragedy  of  Aeschylus  be  gutted  of it's  Chorus  and you leave it little better than a  Skeleton  To proceed upon the simple Plan of Antiquity the  Chorus  introduced 'tis true an agreeable Variety into the  Drama  and was no doubt both useful and ornamental to it as it's peculiar Province had more immediate Reference to the great Ends of all Poetry  prodesse delectare  But after all if these great Ends are better or even as well  answered without the  Chorus  and if these Ends are not obstructed by the Admission of Design Contrivance and Intrigue into the Fable but even promoted by it under the Conduct of a masterly Hand in this Case I say it is not to be denied but the  Chorus  of the Antients has given Place to it's BettersIt is true Mr  Mason  has very positively asserted for I think he has by no Means sufficiently proved in Behalf of the old  Chorus  that to lay no Stress upon subordinate Advantages it augmented the  Pathetic  that it afforded  a graceful and natural Resource to the Embellishments of picturesque Description sublime Allegory and whatever else comes under the Denomination of pure Poetry  and lastly which is most material that it was the properest Vehicle  to convey moral Reflections with Grace and Propriety  For these Reasons which respect both the  Poet  and the  Audience  he judges the Disuse of the  Chorus  to be an irreparable Loss to the modern Stage Let us briefly then review what this Gentleman has said upon each of these Articles  Now with Regard to the first he offers us the Authority of a  Frenchman  If you ask me says he how it augmented the  Pathetic  I cannot give you a better Answer than the  AbbÃ¨ Vatry  has done in his Dissertation on the Subject published in the  Memoirs de l' Acad des Inser  c It affected this says he both in it's  Odes  and  Dialogue  The wonderful Power of Music and the Dance is universally allowed And as these were always  Accompaniments  to the Odes there is no Doubt but they contributed greatly to move the Passions It was necessary that there should be Odes or Interludes but it was also necessary that these Interludes should not suffer the Minds of the Audience to cool but on the contrary should support and fortify those Passions which the previous Scenes had already excited Nothing imaginable could produce this Effect better than the choral Songs and Dances which filled the Mind with Ideas corresponding to the Subject and never failed to add new Force to the Sentiments of the principal Personages In the Dialogue also the Chorus served to move the Passions by shewing to the Spectators other Spectators strongly affected by the Action A Spectacle of such a Kind as is fitted to excite in us the Passions of  Terrour  and  Pity  will not of itself so strongly affect us as when we see others also affected by it The Painters have generally understood this Secret and have had Recourse to an Expedient similar to that of the  Chorus  of the Poets Not content with the simple Representation of an historical Event they have also added Groupes of assistant Figures and exprest in their Faces the different Passions they would  have their Picture excite Nay they sometimes inlist into their Service even irrational Animals In the  Slaughter of the Innocents  LE BRUN was not satisfied with expressing all the Horrour of which the Subject is naturally capable he has also painted two Horses with their Hair standing on End and starting back as afraid to trample upon the bleeding Infants This is an Artifice which has often been employed and which has always succeeded A good Poet should do the same and  Iphigenia  should not be suffered to appear on the Theatre without being accompanied with Persons capable of feeling her Misfortunes  I have transcribed the whole Passage and can't help nothing in the first Place a very extraordinary Inaccuracy in this refin'd Portion of Criticism For sure the abovementioned Horses with their "Hair standing on End" and "starting back" c did greatly add to the Horrour of this famous Piece which yet before had it seems all the Horrour expressed in it of which the Subject was naturally capable or if they did not augment this Horrour it will be difficult methinks to to tell what Business they had there But to be serious  The wonderful Power of Music is universally allow'd and Music is by no Means excluded from the modern Stage Nay I venture to say the  modern  Drama  has Recourse to it more effectually though less frequently than the old  Drama  had as we are more affected by it's occasional and unexpected Graces and Assistances than we should be by it's stated and periodical InterpositionFor the  Dance  I own I am at a Loss to comprehend how it could contribute greatly to move the Passions I mean the Passions proper for Tragedy I do not pretend to ascertain the Nature and Method of the antient  StageDancing  but such has been the Power of the  Dance  in later Times that the  Tragic Muse  who is a very  grave Matron  has I believe no Reason to lament her  dancing Days are over  Admitting therefore at present the Propriety and Efficacy of the  Choral  Songs I cannot conceive how any Kind of  Dance  should support and fortify those Passions which the previous Scenes had excited  or  fill the Mind with Ideas corresponding to the Subject and never fail to add new Force to the Sentiments of the principal Personages  Nor farther can I see any Thing even in the  Songs  or  Odes  which had so peculiar a Tendency to produce these Effects that nothing imaginable could do it  as well  for tho' these might answer this Purpose very sufficiently yet if they were not necessary for it they cannot be contended for as essential to the  Drama  and must consequently be considered only as we have before observed in the Light of  an ancient ConveniencyNow I apprehend the Minds of the Audience are in no Danger of cooling under the present System of the  Drama  and that the Music between the Acts  may  be adapted to the Purposes forenamed of supporting and fortifying the Passions as much as the old  Chorus  could be Without depreciating therefore the real Use and Design of the  Chorus  we only say we can do in many Respects better and even in this as well without it  But farther it seems  In the Dialogue also the  Chorus  served to move the Passions by shewing to the Spectators other Spectators strongly affected by the Action  For  a Spectacle of such a Kind as is fitted to excite in us the Passions of Terrour and Pity will not of itself so strongly affect us as when we see others also affected by it  Admitting the Truth of which Assertion I do not see what is to be inferr'd from it to the Advantage of the antient  Chorus  For does not the modern  Drama  move the Passions as indeed does the antient exclusive of it's  Chorus  by shewing to the Spectators other Persons not mere Spectators but Persons more interested in the Action strongly affected by the Events of the  Tragedy  The Intervention therefore of Spectators as such upon the Stage is with Respect to this Purpose superfluous and insignificant except it can be demonstrated that  the Passions of Terrour and Pity or any other are if I may be allowed the Expression more powerfully excited at the  second Rebound  Let common Experience at once illustrate and determine this MatterSupposing half a dozen indifferent Persons admitted to a Spectacle of Terrour or Distress in real Life for Instance that of a dying Man taking Leave of his Wife his Mistress or his Friend would not such a Spectacle immediately raise suitable Emotions in all of them or would each first consult the Passions of his next Neighbour in order to learn what Effect this Spectacle ought to have upon himself These Questions require no Answer and therefore as the  Drama  is so lively a Representation of real Life they may plainly be applied to any Case of Misery or Horrour exhibited upon the StageFor this Reason also it is that the Illustration of the Matter before us by the Expedients of the Painters is I apprehend with Deference to the ingenious  AbbÃ¨  as Mr  Mason  calls him entirely foreign to the present Purpose The Painters have very wisely had Recourse to such Expedients as are mentioned in the abovequoted Criticism because after all their Art is but Painting still and properly speaking describes the Passions more than it excites them but the  Drama  or rather the  Actor  in the  Drama realizes  what he represents He must be a very insensible Spectator who thinks at  all of the  Poet  or the  Player  when Mr  Garrick  is personating a  Richard  a  Macbeth  or a  Lear  The Poet in short has not the same Occasion for such Artifices and Expedients as the Painter has Let  Iphigenia  appear on the Theatre and behave as she ought to do and I will be answerable for it the  Audience  will be  Persons capable of feeling her Misfortunes  But again by rejecting the  Chorus  Mr  Mason  tells us the true Poet has lost a  graceful and natural Resource to the Embellishments of Picturesque Description sublime Allegory and whatever else comes under the Denomination of  pure Poetry  To which I take Leave to reply That what the  Poet  has lost hereby  Tragedy  has gained for if Mr  Mason  's own Theory be just the  Tragic Muse  as we have before observed from him strikes directly upon the  Passions  of the Audience which I should be glad to know how Picturesque Description I mean such as this Gentleman has favoured us with sublime Allegory and  Poetry in the Abstract  or if you please  pure Poetry  can do Mr  Mason  says the  Lyric Muse  addresses herself to the Imagination of a Reader or Hearer and accordingly  few Men have a Strength of Imagination capable of pursuing the Flights of  Pindar  and still fewer I will venture to add those of Mr  Mason  in this Dramatic Poem I am very far from meaning to  decry this ingenious Author's peculiar Talent  in loco  but I fear in the present Case while he affects to defend the Cause of the  old Chorus  his real Design was to introduce a  new  one For the Name excepted I can discern little or nothing in the  Odes  of Mr  Mason  similar to those of the antient  Chorus  that  poetical Flow of tender Commiseration of religious Supplication or of virtuous Triumph  of which it principally consisted had none of the  longspun  Allegory and  aerial  Imagery with which these  Dramatic  Sonnets of Mr  Mason  abound In Truth it is to be wish'd that this profest Admirer and Imitator of genuine Nature and antient Simplicity in the  Structure  of his  Fable  had paid a little more Regard to them in his  Diction  throughout this whole Poem and particularly in the Stile of the  Choral  Compositions under present Consideration 'Tis Pity indeed an Author so sober and chaste in his whole Oeconomy should be so remarkably extravagant and loose in his Language  In the Hymn to the Morning a great deal seems to be  unfolded  but little  discovered  Away ye Elves away  Shrink at ambrosial Morning's living Ray  That living Ray whose Pow'r benign  Unfolds the Scene of Glory to our Eye  Where thron'd in artless Majesty  The Cherub Beauty sits on Nature's rustic Shrine  p  Now I apprehend it would pose the most able  Linguist  to translate these Lines or the most dextrous  Painter  to give us a Portrait of this angelical Personage  Charity  has ever been rank'd with the first of moral Virtues but Mr  Mason  not only  personifies  and deifies it but likewise makes it a  Geometrician  and a  Musician  into the Bargain  Ah follow still the softey'd Deity  For know each Path she draws  Along the Plain of Life  Meets at the central Dome of social Joy  Again  Humanity  thy awful Strain  Shall ever meet our Ear  Sonorous sweet and clear  And as amid the sprightlyswelling Train  Of dulcet Notes that breath  From Flute or Lyre  The deep Base rolls it's manly Melody  Guiding the tuneful Choir  So thou  Humanity  shalt lead along  Th' accordant Passions in their moral Song  And give our mental Concert truest Harmony  Page  This Passage is I confess very  melodious  in Point of Numbers it is indeed like Music itself for methinks it  sounds well  and  says nothing    In another Ode we have several  picturesque  Images of the Goddess CONTENT presented to us now she sits upon a Bank and listens to a Linnet  Sweet Bird like thine our Lay shall flow  Nor gayly loud nor sadly slow  For to thy Note sedate and clear  CONTENT  still lends a list'ning Ear  Then she is gone to sup with a Hermit and is amazingly calm and compos'd tho' she seems every Minute in danger of being  drown'd  or  knock'd  on the  Head  Perhaps to some lone Cave the Rover flies  Where lull'd in pious Peace the Hermit lies  For scorning oft the gorgeous Hall  Where Banners wave with blazon'd Gold  There will the meekey'd Nymph delight to call  And with the solemn Seer high converse hold  There Goddess on the shaggy Mound  Where tumbling Torrents roar around  Where pendent Mountains o'er your Head  Stretch their formidable Shade  You listen while the holy Seer  Slowly chaunts his Vespers clear  Or of his sparing Mess partake  The sav'ry Pulse the wheaten Cake  The Bev'rage cool of limpid Rill  p  In my humble Opinion these and the two following  Odes  to  Constancy  and  Truth  are much  more calculated to exercise a  Metaphysical  Head than make any Impressions upon a  sensible  Heart And after all the Beauties of such Ideal Poetry as this tho' they may amuse in the  Closet  must surely be lost upon the  Stage  To pass by the Ode to CONSTANCY let us take a short View of TRUTH in all her  Glory  "No Son of Light  Darts swiftly from his heav'nly Height  No Train of radiant Saints descend  Mortals in vain ye hope to find  If Guilt if Fraud has stain'd your Mind  Or Saint to hear or Angel to defend  So  Truth  proclaims I hear the sacred Sound  Burst from the Centre of her burning Throne  Where aye she sits with  starwreath'd Lustre crown'd  A bright Sun clasps her adamantine Zone"  p  It is wonderful to observe how far a true  Poetic  Fancy lifts a Genius above all  Prosaic  Conception Most of us profess ourselves Admirers of the  Naked Truth  but Mr  Mason  has cloth'd her more splendidly than ever  Solomon  was tho' I think he has given her rather too fine a  Buckle  for so clumsy a  Girdle  It is indeed well observ'd by Mr  Pope  that He who would take Boldness from Poetry must leave Dulness in the room of it and I am very sensible that no Species of Poetry is allow'd greater Liberties than the  Ode  SED NON UT PLACIDIS COEUNT IMMITIA C Boldness is the Medium between  Dulness  and  Temerity  the Muse has no more Business above the  Clouds  than she has under the  Ground  and Mr  Mason  tho' he never  creeps  is certainly a  HighFlyer  The extravagant Thoughts the farfetch'd Allusions and the unconnected Ideas in most of these  Odes  are a Proof of itIn truth the Heat of Imagination is apt to transport an Author into false Conclusions and make him believe He writes  Poetry  because He does not write  Prose  But farther I can by no Means agree with Mr  Mason  that  if we had a  Tragedy  of  Shakespear  's form'd on the  Greek  Model we should find in it more frequent if not nobler Instances of the high Poetical Capacity than in any single Composition he has left us  This Author thinks  we have a Proof of this in those parts of his Historical Plays which are call'd  Chorus's  and written in the common Dialogue Metre  Our  Imagination continues he will easily conceive how fine an Ode the Description of the Night preceding the Battle of  Agincourt  would have made in his Hands and what additional Grace it would receive from that Form of Composition  Let us turn to the Description as it now stands in  Shakespear  From Camp to Camp through the foul Womb of Night  The Hum of either Army stilly sounds  That the fixt Centinels almost receive  The secret Whispers of each others Watch  Fire answers Fire and through their paly Flames  Each Battle sees the other's umber'd Face  Steed threatens Steed in high and boastful Neighs  Piercing the Night's dull Ear and from the Tents  The Armourers accomplishing the Knights  With busy Hammers closing Rivets up  Give dreadful Note of Preparation  The Country Cocks do crow the Clocks do toll  This noble Description is full of Imagery drawn from sensible Objects as indeed are most of those we meet with in this incomparable Author witness for Instance the Description of  Dover Cliff  of  Hamlet's Madness  of  Brutus's Disorder  c c It is consequently of the most affecting Nature and in a manner possesses the Hearer or the Reader with the same kind of Terrour which the Bravest probably feel upon the Crisis of a decisive Battle And by the by of the same passionate and affecting i e  Dramatic Nature  are the Poetical Parts of our best  Tragedies  in general Now I cannot conceive that the several Circumstances of this Description could receive additional Force from the Form of an  Ode  notwithstanding the acknowledg'd Power of  Music  and much less that such a Description would appear  to advantage in an  Ode  of Mr  Mason  's Instead of what we  see hear  and  feel  in the striking Particulars of the beforemention'd Description Mr  Mason  would entertain and amaze us with an allegorical Machine of  Horror  riding on the Brow of Night  or  From her black Pinions shedding deadly Dews  It is certain whatever might be the Mystic Beauties of such an  Ode  as this it would at best be a  dispassionate  One and so far infinitely less  Theatrical  than the foregoing Description of  Shakespear  In truth the  pure Poetry  which Mr  Mason  tells us that great Poet had the Power of introducing naturally and what is most strange of joining with  pure Passion  has an Air utterly different from or rather contrary to the Flights of Mr  Mason  throughout this Performance  Shakespear  indeed very rarely gets out of the Reach of our Apprehensions even when his Subject leads him directly into the Province of ImaginationI refer the Reader to his  Midsummer Night's Dream  his  Macbeth  and his  Tempest  Upon the whole of this Article it may I think be safely affirm'd that the modern  Drama  is by no means destitute of Opportunities of having recourse to Poetical Embellishments and  Picturesque  Descriptions of all Kinds and it has recourse to them if not so frequently and obviously  as the antient  Drama  by means of the  Chorus  had at least more consistently with the Essential  Character  of  Tragedy  whose direct Business it is to excite the Passions even according to  Aristotle  's own Definition of it For whether  Images Descriptions  c occasionally and naturally interspers'd with the Matter of the Dialogue itself be not more compatible with that  Character  than separate and detach'd Peices of Poetry is a Question that needs not I conceive be discuss'dNow if these Considerations will lead us to Conclusions in favour of the Poetical Parts of modern  Tragedy  against those of the old  Chorus  they will I am sure do this  a fortiori  against the  pure Poetry  of Mr  Mason  I cannot help observing in this Place that our Author's Affectation of a  Poetical  Diction which contributes so much to the rendering the  Odes  of his  Chorus undramatical  discovers itself likewise in many Parts of the Dialogue itself and often to such a Degree that  Pomp Figure  and  Allegory  supply the Place of  Simplicity Nature and Pathos  How allegorically does  Athelwold  express the Passion of Joy mixt with an Apprehension of imminent Danger  Heav'ns It cannot last  The  giddy height  of Joy to which I'm lifted  Is as a  hanging Rock  at whose  low foot  The  black  and  beating Surge of Infamy  Rolls  ready to receive and  sink my  Soul  p  As this Danger approaches still nearer the Leader of the Chorus tells the unhappy Pair  Athelwold  and  Elfrida  that  Safety now sits wav'ring on their Love  Like the light down upon the Thistles beard  Which every Breeze may part  p  Upon the Earl's declaring his Resolution to murder himself he is caution'd against such a desperate Proceeding by very important but I think scarce intelligible Considerations  Forbear forbear  Think what a sea of deep Perdition whelms  The wretch's trembling Soul who launches forth  Unlicens'd to Eternity Think think  And let the Thought restrain thy impious Hand  The Race of Man is one vast marshall'd Army  Whose num'rous Squadrons fill the Plains of Time  Their Leader the Almighty High in Air  The chos'n Archangel rides whose right Hand wields  The imperial Standard of his Providence  Which dreadly sweeping thro' the vaulted Sky  O'ershadows all Creation  p  With what  Delicacy  and  Pathetic  Force is the Remorse of this Hero express'd in the following Passage  I do deserve to breathe  Deserve to bear this load of Life about me  For many Years to lengthen out my Age  List'ning the hourly Knell of curst Remembrance  Whose  leaden Stroke shall tell to  my sad Soul  That I was faithful once  We may observe farther that the same  Enthusiastic  kind of Spirit betrays our Author in many other Places of this Work where the  Thought  is extremely beautiful into a  Stiffness  and  Formality  of  Language  We will give the Reader a few Instances of this  The Eye that will not weep another's Sorrow  Should  boast no gentler brightness than the glare  That reddens in the eyeball of the Wolf  p  Tenderness and Pity  Have made his breast their Home He is a Man  More apt thro' inborn gentleness to err  In  giving mercy's Tide too free a Course  Than with a  thristy  and  illiberal  Hand  To  circumscribe it's Channel  p  Let no unhallow'd Tongue  Dare to profane her Virtue by it's Praise  'Tis a  bright Prodigy which Admiration  Must  stand in silent Gaze  at and behold  Fullplum'd Perfection take it's Eagle Flight  Above Ambition Sovereignty and Pride  p  Horror Horror  The  Pen of Fate dipt in it's deepest Gall  Perhaps on that  illomen'd Wall  Now writes th' Event of this tremendous Day  O that our  weaker Sight  Could read the  mystic Characters  and  spy  What to the  unpurg'd mortal Eye  Is hid in endless Night  p  See ye Virgins  See how  Despair beneath his gastly Brow  Stretches her blackest Cloud  thro' whose  thick Night  His Eyes  fast rooted  in their  angry Rings  Dart a dire Glear  p  For Solitude  Which sooths the trnnquil Mind has dread Effects  On wrathful Breasts The same  sequester'd Pine  Which veils the gurgling Ringdove with it's Boughs  Whets with his knotty Trunk the Boar's vext Tooth  And  points each Fang with Death  In short to this  Spirit  we may perhaps ascribe the Impropriety and  Unseasonableness  of some of Mr  Mason  's most elegant and affecting Images and DescriptionsBut I forbear to multiply QuotationsEnough I presume has been said to shew that Mr  Mason  throughout this whole Work discovers much more of the  Poet  than the  Tragedian  He discovers so much indeed of the former that abating these and a few other Blemishes and Defects which I thought it but Justice to my Subject to endeavour to set in a true Light  Elfrida  as a  Dramatic Poem  has many exquisite Beauties which however as they must be obvious to judicious  Eyes I forbear not for Want of Inclination but of Time to recite Indeed as this Performance is entitled a  Dramatic Poem  and not a  Tragedy  by the Author himself I should have made no Exceptions to it if the  Stile  of the  Letters  prefixed to the  Drama  had been as  modest  as the  Title Page  But to return once more to the  Chorus  Mr  Mason  laments that with the Means of introducing Poetry naturally is lost also the Opportunity of conveying moral Reflections with Grace and Propriety  He tells us afterwards  that in those Parts of the  Drama  where the Judgment of a mixt Audience is most liable to be misled by what passes before it's View the chief Actors are generally too much agitated by the furious Passions or too much attached by the tender ones to think cooly and impress on the Spectators a moral Sentiment properly  This is indeed asserting roundly but however I apprehend without sufficient Foundation in Reason or ExperienceI will make bold to assert too that it is the Business of the  Dramatic  Poet and indeed of every other in a  moral  View to steal imperceptibly into the Heart of his Audience or Reader that Sentiments  occasionally  and  naturally  suggested by the Circumstances of the Parties personally concerned will have a more forcible Effect than a thousand  set Lessons  of  Music  and  Morality  from the Mouth of a third Person and that the chief Actors are  not  generally "too much agitated by the furious Passions or attached by the tender ones to think cooly enough for the Purpose and impress on the Spectators a moral Sentiment properly"  In the next Sentence we are told that  A Confidant or Servant has seldom Sense enough to do it never Dignity enough to be regarded  Now by the way a Servant or a Confidant may always if the Poet please be as sensible a Person as any in the  Drama  and sure the Dignity of either at least of the latter is equal to that of the Personages of the antient  Chorus  which for the most Part consisted of a Company of Virgins the Attendants and Countrywomen of the Hero of the PoemMr  Mason  's own  Chorus  with all it's Pomp and Solemnity is composed of Lord  Athelwold  's  Maids  But after all do the modern  Tragedians  usually convey moral Sentiments thro' the Mouths of  Servants  and  Confidants  as these Expressions would lead us to imagine or granting they do and err in so doing is the particular Error of a few to be objected to the general System Instead therefore of these and of the  Chorus  too the Moderns are  sufficiently provided with Persons not merely capable of seeing and hearing but of arguing advising and reflecting from whom a moral Sentiment never comes unnaturally but suitably and gracefully  For such are or may be all the  Persons  in the  Drama  "The Character of  Pierre  in  Venice Preserv'd  Mr  Mason  justly observes in another Place  when left entirely to the Judgment of the Audience is perhaps one of the most improper for public View that ever was produced on any Stage It is almost impossible but some Part of the Spectators should go from the Representation with very false and immoral Impressions But had that  Tragedy  been written on the antient Plan had  Pierre  's Character been drawn just as it is and some few Alterations made in  Jaffeir  's I know no two Characters more capable of doing Service in a moral View when justly animadverted upon by the  Chorus  For bad Characters become on this Plan as harmless in the Hands of the Poet as the Historian  This would indeed be as I have elsewhere observed very just Reasoning against any Man that should undertake to vindicate Mr  Otway  's Conduct in the  Tragedy  referred to and to oppose the  same  to the  antient Plan  but as this never was or will be done by any Man in his Senses it is surely inconclusive to argue against the Inconveniencies of the whole modern  Dramatic  System from the  particular  Error of a  particular  PoetThe Truth is perhaps this Gentleman has conceived strong Prepossessions in Favour of that  Species  of Poetry which his Talent evidently leads him to for if he had not himself a particular  Taste  for an  Ode  'tis likely he would scarce contend for it as absolutely essential  to the  Drama  But whatever may have been his real Sentiments upon the Occasion I hope I have given sufficient Reasons for differing from him  Before I conclue I can't help taking Notice that Mr  Mason  has drawn Mr  Dryden  himself into his Interests in a very extraordinary Manner and this I do the rather as I have more than once referred to that excellent Person's Authority Mr  Mason  among the insuperable Difficulties in the Way to the desired Reformation of the  English  Stage intimates the present improper Form of the  Theatres  and the additional Expence requisite for the Purposes of the antient System renders the Matter he thinks impracticable  This he says Mr  Dryden  foresaw long ago  and then quotes the following curious Passage from him  A new Theatre much more ample and much deeper must be made for that Purpose besides the Cost of sometimes forty or fifty Habits which is an Expence too large to be supplied by a Company of Actors 'Tis true I should not be sorry to see a  Chorus  on a Theatre more than as large and as deep again as our's built and adorned at a King's Charges and on that Condition and another which is that my Hands were not bound behind me as now they are I should not despair of making such a Tragedy as might be both instructive and delightful according to the Manner of the  Grecians  Now does any common Reader apprehend from this Passage that because Mr  Dryden  tells us he should not be sorry to see a  Chorus  on a commodious Theatre c therefore he ardently wish'd to see one and judg'd it absolutely essential to the  Drama  or because he declares that in such Case he should not  despair  of making such a Tragedy as  might  be instructive and delightful according to the Manner of the  Grecians  therefore he  long'd  to try his Strength in this Field and acknowledged the grand Secret  prodesse delectare  was the Characteristic of the  Greek Drama  only And yet such methinks is Mr  Mason  's Construction of this Passage"  This Suffrage of Mr  Dryden  says he is however very apposite to to the present Point But it serves also to vindicate my Design of imitating the Greek Drama For if he who was so prejudiced to the modern Stage as to think Intrigue a capital Beauty in it if he I say owns that the grand Secret  prodesse delectare  was the Characteristic of the Greek Drama only nothing I think can better justify my present Attempt than the Approbation he gives to it in this Passage  That is to reduce this Suffrage to a smaller Compass Mr  Dryden  informs us that if Things were properly circumstanced he would at all Events have attempted a  Tragedy  upon the  Greek  Model and with  some Hopes  of Success  therefore he  plainly preferred  the  antient  to the  modern  SystemLet the Merits of the Cause be tried by the Evidence of Mr  Dryden  and  Fabio vel Judice vincam  I have nothing farther to add than that if the Reader should chance to wonder at the Freedom I have sometimes taken with this truly ingenious Writer I desire it may be imputed to my natural Resentment of that Air of Sufficiency and Superiority with which he introduces I do not say his Performance but his System  Good Sense i e  common Sense  as well as Antiquity required an Adherence to the Unities  This peremptory Declaration involves in a very scurvy Term almost every Dramatic Writer but our Author and a  Frenchman  or two since the Days of  Aristotle  But delicate Judgment it seems and a true Taste for  genuine Nature  and  antient Simplicity  are the Allotments and Privileges only of a happy FewIn what Contempt does this Gentleman hold the universal Practice of the  modern  Stage when he acquaints us "he believes he could quickly make the whole tolerably fit for an English Audience by putting the Dialogue of the  Chorus  into the Mouth of an  Emma  or  Matilda  who with some little Shew of sisterly Concernment might be easily made to claim Kindred with  Earl Athelwold  and by the Addition of an  unnecessary Incident or two which would cost him no more than they are worth in contriving and an unmeaning Personage or two who would be as little Expence in creating" I confess I see no Sort of Foundation for this Insult and Superiority in the Arguments or rather Assertions of Mr  Mason  for which Reason I have written my Thoughts upon this Occasion otherwise I have no more Pretension to write against him as an  Adversary  than Desire to enter the Lists with him as a  Poet  LETTERS c  LETTERS c  SIR  I Sit down in compliance with your Request to give you my Sentiments upon the Subject started at our last InterviewIn consequence of my Researches upon this Occasion I have been almost led into a very whimsical Conclusionthat the greatest Genius is the Author a Man happens to have in his Hand It seems but reasonable to pin our Opinion of an Author upon that of his Editor or Translator and yet we may do this till we are in a manner at a loss for a Criterion to judge good Writing by Genius assumes as many Shapes as ever  Proteus  did and all literary Merit consists principally in Invention in Judgment in Fire in Propriety in Simplicity in Elegance in Accuracy in Ease in Wit in Humour in Fullness in Brevity c c according to the Spirit and Complexion of the Writer before me Mr  Pope  declares  Homer  was the greatest  Epic  Poet in the World and I  am quite of his Mind till I take up Mr  Meyrick  's  Tryphiodorus  When I look into my  Statius  I begin to think  Virgil  was a very cold and insipid Writer and  Virgil  's Acquaintance assure me that  Statius  was little better than a MadmanIn short by Virtue of the Preface prefix'd to him  Sophocles  or  Ovid Terence  or  Martial Milton  or  Butler  c c is the best Poet  Herodotus  or  Eutropius Livy  or  Sallust Rapin  or  Clarendon  is the best Historian  Aristotle  or  Newton Descartes  or  Burnet  c c is the best Philosopher and  Hammond  or  Hobbes South  or  Toland Sherlock  or  Middleton  is the best Divine  But to be seriousYou will wonder perhaps to be told that what gave Rise to these ludicrous Remarks of mine was nothing less than Mr  Pope  's Commentary upon his universally and justly admir'd Original  Homer  an Author whom you will scarce think capable of being complimented or aggrandiz'd to an undue and extravagant Degree especially by so judicious an EditorIndeed these great Names are so truly venerable that I must obviate the Alarm you may take by assuring you that what I am going to say neither can nor means to detract from the infinite Merit of the  Grecian  or the  British Homer  for the former  See the Note at v of the th B of the Iliad  I believe upon the  whole that scarce any Mortal ever came near him for Wisdom Learning and all good Qualities  for the latter He has certainly done more Justice to his Author as an Expositor only than all the Commentators antient and modern put together After this Declaration you will give me leave to tell you that Mr  Pope  himself appears to me notwithstanding his very great Abilities to have sometimes misapprehended the real Design of his Original to have not unfrequently to use his own Words again  attributed to him what does not belong to him  and now and then to have imagin'd Proprieties or cover'd Defects with a seeming View rather to the Honour of his Author at all Events than to the precise Ascertainment of Truth All this indeed might be owing not to a blind Admiration or to a Want of Discernment but to a Degree of laudable Partiality or a too implicit Adherence to the Notions and Interpretations of the Commentators his Predecessors  But whatever may be allow'd to an Editor or Translator a Standerby will be more impartial and is as such more likely to think justly of an Author You who turn to your  Homer  merely with an Intent to be delighted with him and consider Mr  Pope  as a Person very able and willing to illustrate his great Beauties and Excellencies will be apt to sce no  Grounds for the above Allegations but in an Affectation of Singularity or in Caprice especially as Mr  Pope  makes no Scruple occasionally to point out the Blemishes of his Author and seems by many Remarks to shew himself thoroughly divested of all unreasonable Prepossessions  See the Note at V B xi  It is customary says he with those who translate or comment on an Author to use him as they do their Mistress they can see no Faults or convert his very Faults into Beauties but I cannot be so partial to  Homer  c c  In another Place after having enumerated what seem'd to him to be  Faults of any consideration  he tells us  See the Note at V B xvi  he hopes after so free a Confession no reasonable Modern will think him touch'd with the  of Madam  Dacier  and others I am sensible continues he of the Extremes which Mankind run into in extolling and depreciating Authors We are not more violent and unreasonable in attacking those who are not yet establish'd into Fame than in defending those who are even in every minute Trifle  There is as much Modesty as there is Truth in this ingenuous Declaration and there is great Reason to suppose Mr  Pope  in general never speaks of  Homer  in higher Terms than he really believ'd he deserves  However whether I have been actuated by a Spirit of Vanity or of Humour rather than just Criticism you will be able to judge when you have read the following Sheets in which I propose to try  Homer  by himself as every Writer should by his own Key and by the Suffrages and Evidence of his own Advocates and Witnesses For which Purpose and for something of Method's sake the first Subject of our Inquiry shall be the  Machinery  of the  Iliad  and the next the general  Oeconomy  of this great Poet and his particular Conduct in Respect of  Characters Incidents  and other Circumstances And I persuade myself the Result of this Inquiry will be your agreeing with me that  Homer  with the most fruitful Invention extensive Knowledge and no small Judgment has really much less Art and Design in this Work than he is supposed to have had at least for what appears to the contrary from the Observations of his Commentators  LETTER II  THE  Machinery  you know is that Part which the  Gods  bear in an  Epic  Poem That of  Homer  is conducted with extraordinary Circumstances of Solemnity and Magnificence But the great Question is whether we are in general to take the Simple and literal Sense of  the Author with regard to the Appearance and Actions of these superiour Beings or whether we are to suppose a secret and allegorical Meaning to be veil'd under all this  Apparatus  or in other Words whether we can with any Degree of Certainty extract a System of Morality or Theology from it This has been attempted to be done by Mr  Pope  and all others who have undertaken to explain illustrate or defend the Writings of this inimitable Poet and it must be own'd too that this has been done in many Places in a very plausible Manner However I must be of Opinion upon reviewing the  Iliad  and comparing it with itself that these Gentlemen have push'd this Matter too far and by strain'd Explications and Refinements found out Mysteries which were never intended that generally speaking we shall do more Justice and even Honour to  Homer  by supposing  See the Note at L B V  he follow'd Fame and common Opinion in his Account of the Gods though no way agreeable to Truth  Upon this Supposition at least He will I think appear much more uniform and reconcileable with himself I do not deny indeed that the  Iliad  abounds with noble and rational Sentiments and such as are conformable to true Theology particularly that the Necessity of Divine Assistance  and Interposition for all Human Successes is a Moral strongly inculcated throughout the Poem But whatever  Homer  's religious Notions as a  Man  might be or as Mr  Pope  expresses it  whatever he might  think  of his Gods he took them as he found them he brought them into Action according to the Notions which were then entertain'd and in some Stories as they were then believ'd  If you consider his  Jupiter  as a  Fabulous  or  Poetical  Character there is less in it to shock you but if you believe He meant to exhibit to his Reader under this Character "the One supreme omnipotent God" You must soon have a very mean Opinion not only of his Philosophy but even of his Sense 'Tis true  He sometimes introduces  Jupiter  with a Majesty and Superiority worthy the great Ruler of the Universe  particularly in the Beginning of the th Book but he is in general represented as much subject to Weakness Infirmity and Passion as the inferiour Deities Indeed if any Divine Attribute be plainly and consistently applied to  Jupiter  it is  Power  yet even this seems to be applied rather from the Authority of  Fabulous Tradition  than by the  religious Theory  of the Poet himself For the Story of the Rebellion of the Gods and their Defeat by  Jupiter  which  Homer  refers to cannot be understood to be his own Invention Mr  Pope  acknowleges  the "  See Note at L of the th B  Notions and Descriptions of his Author" in Respect of the Deity  to be in many Passages unworthy of the Divinity  See Essay on Homer p  He is not even exempted from our common Appetites and Frailties He is made to eat drink and sleep  It is pleasant enough to observe how careful the Commentators have been notwithstanding such Acknowledgements to maintain the suppos'd Superiority of  Jupiter  and what shifts they have recourse to to save his Honour upon all Occasions  See Note at L of the st B  Eustathius  Mr  Pope  tell sus makes a distinction between  and  the Words which are us'd at the End of the first Book and the Beginning of the second with regard to  Jupiter  's sleeping He says  only means lying down in a Disposition to sleep  Now granting this Interpretation  to salve the Contradiction that else would follow in the next Book where it is said  Jupiter  did not  sleep  and to prove bytheby that  Homer  himself did not  nod  in this Passage yet surely it will afford but a slender Argument for the extraordinary Vigilancy of  Jupiter  in general beyond that of the other Gods especially as  Homer  acquaints us in the preceding Lines that he went  to the Bed where  he had us'd to take his Repose  See L and of the Iliad  It is worth observing to you that some Criticks in  Aristotle  's Time objected to the Passage in the second Book and  See Note at L of the d B  pretended it was ridiculous to describe all the Gods sleeping besides  Jupiter  To which it seems  Aristotle  answers  that nothing is more usual or allowable than that Figure which puts  all  for the  greater  part  A plain Proof that neither  Aristotle  nor the abovemention'd Critics of those Times suppos'd any extraordinary Degree of Vigilancy could have been with any Propriety ascrib'd by the Poet to  Jupiter  Perhaps you will be of Opinion too that there is a little too much Refinement in another Place in the fifth Book where Mr  Pope  says  See Note of L of the th B  we may observe the Decorum and Decency his Author constantly preserves  in making  Jupiter  only  Smile  upon certain Occasions while the other Gods  laugh out  I leave it to you to judge what Sort of a Salvo this must be allowing any Foundation for the Distinction itself as indeed I do not recollect there is There seems at least to be universal Jollity in Heaven in one very remarkable Passage without any reserve for the Gravity of this Deity I mean in the first Book where  Vulcan  See at L of the st B  designs  to move laughter by taking upon him the Office of  Hebe  and  Ganymede  with his aukward limping Carriage  Vulcan with aukward grace his Office plies  And unextinguish'd Laughter shakes the Skies  Thus you see the  Jupiter  of  Homer  with all his Pomp and Preeminence is hardly above a Level with the subordinate Deities in point of corporal Weakness and Infirmity nor will you find him to rank much higher if you take a View of his Conduct and Actions in general throughout the Poem You will observe him upon numberless Occasions under the Influence of Passions utterly unsuitable to the Purity as well as Dignity of the Supreme Being The Fiction of his  being deceiv'd and laid asleep  and of his amorous correspondence with  Juno  has as Mr  Pope  confesses as great  an Air of Impiety and Absurdity  as any Fable in all Antiquity  I  See Note at L of the th B  must needs upon the whole says that ingenious Remarker as far as I can judge give up the Morality of this Fable but what Colour of Excuse for it  Homer  might have from antient Tradition or what mystical or allegorical Sense might atone for the appearing Impiety is hard to be ascertain'd at this distant Period of Time  Here is a Condemnation and a  Palliation of a Fault in one Breath Indeed Mr  Pope  thro' his unabated Zeal for the Honour of his Original is  See the Note last referred to  willing afterwards to suppose the "present Passage to be grounded on Religion" and to be nothing more than the  Representation of a religious Solemnity or else to be purely allegorical and as such implying only  the Congress of  Jupiter  and  Juno  the Mingling of the  Aether  and the  Air  which are generally said to be signified by these two Deities But I believe if you consult the Place you will think the first Expedient a forc'd one and the second allowing the  Physical  Signification of these two Deities insufficient for the intended Vindication For what Connection is there in the Mingling of the  Aether  and the  Air  with the Matter in Hand or how does it in the least effect the Circumstances of the Battle between the  Greeks  and the  Trojans  To say nothing of  Venus  who certainly is no  Physical  Deity and yet bears a part in this TransactionThe literal and obvious Sense of  Homer  with all its Grossness seems to be the only consistent one which this Passage can fairly be made to carry  It is worth while to take Notice of the Shifts the Commentators have recourse to when they are prest with Difficulties of this Nature Agreeably to the Circumstances of the Extremity the  Allegories of  Homer  are  Moral  and  Physical  His  See Note at L of the th B  Heaven is no more than an ideal World of abstracted Beings and so every Motion which rises in the Mind of Man is attributed to the Quality to which it belongs with the Name of the Deity who is supposed to preside over that Quality superadded to it  the  See Note at L of the th B  Deities sometimes mean no more than Beings that presided over the Passions and Faculties of the Mind and in consequence of all this  Jupiter  is either the  Aether  or the  Father of Gods and Men Juno  is the Goddess of  Honour  or the  Air  and  Minerva  the Goddess not only of  Wisdom  but of  Craft  that is both of  true  and  false  Wisdom  c c as Occasions and Exigencies requireNow 'tis certain by these Means any Difficulty may be solved and any Passage in this Author pretty easily cleared but all this while the Question is whether any System can be ascertained Nay in Places where the Meaning of the Author is irreconcileable with allegorical Construction it is supposed to  See Note at B xxi  be "darkened by the Remoteness of our Time" A hidden and mysterious Sense there plainly  is  or certainly  must  be and we must at all Events and tho' apparent Absurdities will be saved by it reject a  literal  Interpertation of  Homer  where  the Gods are concerned Mr  Pope  himself owns that sometimes  Homer  's  See Essay on Homer P  Machine's play a little too Grossly and that the Fable violently oppresses the Moral which it may be lost Labour to search for in every minute Circumstance if indeed it was intended to be there  In Truth I am apt to think we should read this Poet with more Pleasure and equal Profit if we perplexed ourselves less to find out Mysteries in him and by the way it is scarce worth our Pains to investigate hidden Meanings when the plain and literal Moral of the Poem is as obvious upon a thousand Occasions as it is admirable and excellent If you consider the  Machinery  of  Homer  in a  Poetical  rather than a  Theological  or  Philosophical  Light and suppose his Gods to be real Characters acting under the Influence of Human Passions as antient Fables represented them and taking their Measures from Motives of personal Affection Resentment c c I believe you will have a surer Inlet into the Meaning of this famous Author and be able to examine him by Rules not liable to Difficulties which are only to be removed by forced and unnatural SolutionsBut as there is a Novelty in this Opinion You will expect I should strengthen and confirm it by more Reasons and Observations  LETTER III  THE  See Note at L B v  famous Censure of  Tully  and  Longinus  mentioned by Mr  Pope  that  Homer makes God's of his Heroes and Mortals of his Gods  will appear to be groundless if you regulate your Ideas of this Author by the Notions I have conceived of him For pure  Poetical  Fictions whether invented or adopted by  Homer  come not properly under the Cognisance of a  Philosophical  Inquiry Accordingly we shall not only have a ready Excuse for this great Poet when he introduces his Deities  feasting fighting wounded by Men and shedding a Sort of Blood  but also when they are represented as committing Actions unworthy of themselves and of the respective Characters they are supposed by the common Opinion of Commentators to sustain Mr  Pope  allows that  if  See Note at L B iv  the  Trojans  had no Right to break the Treaty  made between them and the  Grecians  upon the Duel of  Paris  and  Menelaus  the Machine where  Juno  is made to propose Perjury  Jupiter  to allow it and  Minerva  to be commissioned to hasten the Execution of it would be  one  of the hardest to be reconciled to Reason in the whole Poem  Whether therefore the  Trojans  had a Right to  break the Treaty is a Question it will be very Material and I think easy to determine Now that "the  See Note at L B iv  Conditions of the Treaty were valid" notwithstanding the snatching away of  Paris  by  Venus  in a Cloud "that is to say that" the Controversy was to be decided  either  by the  Victory  or by the  Death  of one of the Combatants is I apprehend apparent from many Considerations It is certain  in the first proposal of the Challenge  Paris  mentions only the Victory  And who his Rival shall in Arms Subdue  nor does  Hector  who carries it say any more  However continues the Note  Menelaus  understands it of the Death by what he replies  Fall he that must beneath his Rivals Arms  And live the rest  And in the solemn Oath too  Agamemnon  specifies the latter  "If by Paris slain"  and  If by my Brother's Arms the  TROJAN  bleed  Priam  also understands it of both saying at his leaving the Field  Whose Arms shall conquer and whose Prince shall fall  Heav'n only knows  Paris  himself confesses he has lost the Victory in his Speech to  Helen  which he would hardly have done had the whole depended upon that alone and lastly  Menelaus  after the Conquest is clearly  his by the Flight of  Paris  is still searching round the Field to kill him as if all were of no Effect without the Death of his AdversaryIt appears from hence says Mr  Pope  that the  Trojans  had no ill pretence to break the Treaty so that  Homer  ought not to have been directly accused of making  Jupiter  the Author of Perjury in what follows which is one of the chief of  Plato  's Objections against him  But was it not extremely natural for  Menelaus Agamemnon  and  Priam  to  mention  the  Death  of one of the Combatants as the Decision of the Controversy tho' the Terms at the Challenge  specified Victory  only in as much as the  Death  of one seem'd to be the unavoidable Consequence of the Duel and the Deliverance of  Paris  by  Venus  was a Circumstance that could not possibly be foreseen For  Paris  he could not be so absurd as to deny the Loss of the Victory whatever Shifts he might be drove to evade the Articles of the Combatindeed he seems to hint at the Expedient of a second Engagement  This Day the Foe prevail'd by  Pallas'  pow'r  We yet may vanquish in a happier Hour  And lastly for  Menelaus  he might very naturally "search round the Field to kill his Adversary" not for the effectual Determination of the Controversy but for the Gratification of his  personal  Resentment  Be this as it will whatever private Persons might think of this Affair it is plain the  Greeks  looked upon the War as ended by this great Event and accordingly  Agamemnon  calls upon the  Trojans  to fulfill the Conditions of the Treaty  Ye  Trojans Dardans  all our gen'rous Foes  Hear and attest from Heav'n with Conquest crown'd  Our Brother's Arms the just Success have found  Be therefore now the  Spartan  Wealth restor'd  Let  Argive Helen  own her lawful Lordc c  But in a Word to put the Matter out of all Doubt the very Terms at the Commission given to  Minerva  suppose the Conditions of the Treaty to be binding upon the  Trojans  The Sire of Men and Monarch of the Sky  Th' Advice approv'd and bade  Minerva  fly  Dissolve the League and all her Arts employ  To make the Breach the faithless Act of  Troy  These two last Circumstances Mr  Pope  for Reasons obvious enough takes not the least Notice of Indeed he found himself so prest by the Difficulties with which this whole Transaction is surrounded that he is forced to have Recourse to one of the Expedients abovementioned viz that of supposing  Homer  's Heaven to be  sometimes  no more than an ideal World of abstracted Beings c c agreeably to this Notion he resolves the Business into this  easy Allegory  as  he is pleased to call it  See Note at L B iv  Pandarus  who broke the Truce by shooting an Arrow at  Menelaus  thinks it  Prudence  to gain Honour and Wealth at the Hands of the  Trojans  by destroying  Menelaus  This Sentiment is also incited by a Notion of  Glory  of which  Juno  is represented as Goddess  Jupiter  who is supposed to know the Thoughts of Men permits the Action which he is not Author of c c"  But how is all this to be reconciled with the general Rules of Interpretation or with what Mr  Pope  See Note at L  tells us in the very next Note  The Goddess went not to the  Trojans  because they hated  Paris  and would rather have given him up  See L at the last B  than have done an ill Action for him She therefore looks among the Allies and finds  Pandarus  who was of a Nation noted for  Perfidiousness  and had a Soul  avaricious  enough to be capable of engaging in this Treachery for the Hopes of a Reward from  Paris  From what Principles of  Prudence  then or of  Honour  did  Pandarus  act or lastly how can  Jupiter  be said barely to  permit  what he expressly  commands  It is out of the Power of  Allegory  and  Refinement  to salve the Characters of these Deities upon the present OccasionBut according to the Notion I have formed of  Homer  's  Deities there will be nothing puzzling in all this AffairI can suppose  Juno  and  Minerva  to be actuated by a Desire of  personal  Vengeance on the  quondam Judgment of Paris  and indeed I am warranted in this Supposition almost by the present Behaviour of these Goddesses but clearly I presume by a Passage in the th Book of the  Iliad  where the Poet informs us that these very Deities with  Neptune  opposed the Proposal of all the rest to dispatch  Mercury  to steal away the Body of  Hector  purely from the implacable Hatred they bore to  Troy  ever since that fatal Determination    Pallas  this denies  And th' unrelenting Empress of the Skies  E'er since that Day implacable to  Troy  What Time young  Paris  simple Shepherd Boy  Won by destructive Lust Reward obscene  Their Charms rejected for the  Cyprian  Queen  Mr  Pope  maintains the Authenticity of this Passage which it seems some of the  See Note at L B xxiv  Antients had disputed who  judged it as an Indecency that the Goddess of  Wisdom  and  Achilles  should be equally inexorable  They thought farther that  had  Homer  been acquainted with the Judgment of  Paris  he would undoubtedly have mentioned it before this time in his Poem c" It may be answered replies Mr  Pope  that the  Silence of  Homer  in the foregoing Part of the Poem as to the Judgment of  Paris  is no Argument that he was ignorant of that Story Perhaps he might think it most proper to unfold the  Cause  of the Destruction of  Troy  in the Conclusion of the  Ilias  that the Reader seeing the Wrong done and the Punishment of that Wrong immediately following might acknowledge the Justice of it  According to this Observation which confirms what I have been saying we must look beyond the Rape of  Helen  for the original Cause of the Destruction of  Troy  and for the  Wrong  done which so much exasperated these Goddesses  The same Reason proceeds the Note will be an Answer to the Objection relating to the Anger of  Pallas Wisdom  cannot be satisfied without  Justice  and consequently  Pallas  ought not to cease from Resentment till  Troy  has suffered the Deserts of her Crimes  Now whether  that  Crime of  Paris  could fairly be considered as the Crime of  Troy  and whether therefore  Wisdom  could with  Justice  pursue it to the Destruction of a whole People a Novice in Casuistry may determineIf we suppose by the by that the  Juno  of  Virgil  was copied from this Original as there is I think no Doubt but she was we find that Poet in plain Terms ascribing the Illwill of this Goddess towards the  Trojans  to be the Affront put upon her by  Paris  Manet altÃ¢ mente repÃ´stum  Judicium Paridis spretaeque injura formae  Aen L  You will begin probably to think the Commentators have affected too much to discover  Poetical Secrets  in an Author whose Design I take to have been much more simple than it is generally imagined to beFor your farther Satisfaction you shall hear from me again upon this Subject  LETTER IV  THE Commentators tell us it is with great Art and Judgment that  Homer  has engaged his several Deities either on the Side of  Greece  or on that of  Troy  I cannot give you a beter Account of their Sentiments upon this Head than what you have in Mr  Pope  's Note transcribed from  Eustathius  See Note at L B xx  This Division of the Gods is not made at Random but founded on very solid Reasons drawn from the Nature of  these  two Nations He places on the Side of the  Greeks  all the Gods who preside over Arts and Sciences to signify how much in that respect the  Greeks  excelled all other Nations  Juno Pallas Neptune Mercury  and  Vulcan  are for the  Greeks Juno  not only as the Goddess who presides over Marriage and  who is concerned to revenge an Jnjury done to the Nuptial Bed but likewise as the Goddess who represents Monarchical Government which was better established in  Greece  than any where else  Pallas  because being the Goddess of  War  and  Wisdom  she ought to assist those who are wronged besides the  Greeks  understood the Art of War better than the  Barbarians Neptune  because he was an Enemy to the  Trojans  upon Account of  Laomedon  's perfidiousness and because most of the  Greeks  being come from Islands or Peninsulas they were in some Sort his Subjects  Mercury  because he is a God who presides over Stratagems of War and because  Troy  was taken by that of the Wooden Horse and lastly  Vulcan  as the declared Enemy of  Mars  and of all Adulterers and as the Father of ArtsThe Reasons why  Mars  and  Venus  engage for the  Trojans  are very obvious the Point in Hand was to favour Ravishers and Debauchees But the same Reason you will say does not serve for  Apollo Diana  and  Latona  It is urg'd that  Apollo  is for the  Trojans  because of the Darts and Arrows which were the principal Strength of the  Barbarians  and  Diana  because she presided over Dancing and those  Barbarians  were great Dancers and  Latona  as influenc'd by her Children  Xanthus  being a  Trojan  River is interested for his Country  Now whether these are not rather  ingenious  than  solid  Reasons is in my Mind scarce a QuestionFor all that is here asserted is far from being true  All  the Gods who preside over Arts and Sciences are not on the Side of the  Greeks  Apollo  who is surely one of the most considerable of them being the perpetual Patron of  Troy  so that  Homer  never meant by  this  Adjustment to  signify how much in this respect the  Greeks  excelled all other Nations  Juno  and  Pallas  as plausible as the Reasons here alledged for their siding with the  Grecians  may seem to be act in this Affair by their own  See L c B iv  Confessions as we have seen from very different Motives nor will it follow by the Way that because the latter of these Goddesses assisted the  Greeks therefore Homer  would intimate that the  Greeks  understood the Art of War better than the  Barbarians  for as Mr  Pope  observes upon  Homer  's introducing  Apollo  on the Side of the  Trojans  in the fourth Book  Mars  See Note at L B iv  the Friend of  Troy  which signifies Courage without Conduct proving too weak to resist  Minerva  or Courage with Conduct the Poet brings in  Wisdom  to assist  Mars  under the appearance of  Apollo  and consequently as much may be inferred to the Advantage of the  Trojans  from the constant Interposition  of  this  God in  their  Behalf as is in the Passage before us to that of the  Greeks  from the Consideration of the Aid of  Minerva  But farther  Neptune  it seems is for the  Greeks  because he was an Enemy to the  Trojans  upon Account of  Laomedon  's Perfidiousness and because most of the  Greeks  being come from Islands or Peninsulas they were in some Sort his Subjects  Now  Laomedons  's  See L B xxi  Perfidiousness consisted in the Refusal of the Wages due to this God on Account of the Building of the Walls of  Troy  and in other illusage and so we are to look upon  Neptune  's espousing the  Grecian  Cause as the Effect of his Resentment of those  personal  Indignities and in this Light he is only acting in conformity to the Idea I have framed of  Homer  's Gods in general But why the  Greeks  can with more Propriety be called  Neptune  's Subjects because they came from  Islands  or  Peninsulas  than the  Trojans  themselves who inhabited a  Seaport  Town for which very reason Mr  Pope  conjectures  Homer  ascribes the Building of the Wall to  Neptune  only I confess I am at a loss to discoverAgain  Mercury  we are informed is a Partisan of the  Grecians  because he is a God who presides over Stratagems of War and because  Troy  was taken by that of the Wooden Horse    Now the ingenuity of the Stratagem of the wooden Horse if we believe  Virgil  we must ascribe not to  Mercury  but to  Pallas  Instar Montis equum divinÃ¢  Palladis  arte Aedificant  However to let this Deity have the Credit of it I would only ask whether supposing he had been introduced by  Homer  on the Part of  Troy  the Sagacity of  Eustathius  would not have assigned as specious a Reason for it as the present I can conceive it to be this Mercury  is for the  Trojans  because he presides over Thieves and Robbers and is the Favourer of all clandestine Enterprizes such as was the Rape of  Helen  by  ParisBut lastly  Vulcan  assists the  Greeks  as the declared Enemy of  Mars  and of all Adulterers and as the Father of Arts  Truehis  personal  Enmity to  Mars  and  consequentially  to  all  Adulterers it is granted naturally engaged him on the  Grecian  Sidebut as the Father of the  Mechanical  Arts methinks he should have fought  under Apollo  the Father of the  liberal  ones  On the other Hand  the Reasons says  Eustathius  why  Mars  and  Venus  engage for the  Trojans  are very obvious the Point in Hand was to favour Ravishers and Debauchees rather a  Ravisher  c  If  all  the aboveassigned Reasons had been as obvious as these it had indeed  been scarce worth while to have entered into a Discussion of this Matter but it would be extraordinary if there were  no  Circumstances to  colour  the Hypothesis of the CommentatorsOpinions all this while are not to be grounded on a  few  Circumstances that are contrasted by  many  othersThe Reasons given for the Assistance of the other Deities to  Troy  which indeed are delivered with an Air of Diffidence are most of them farfetched  It is urged that  Apollo  is for the  Trojans  because of the Darts and Arrows which were the principal Strength of the  Barbarians  supposing but by the way not admitting the Truth of which Assertion itself might not  Apollo  who is  Destiny  according to the common Notion have been represented with much more Significancy as opposing  Troy  whose Destruction was determined by  Fate  One Reason  See Note at L B xxi  given by  Dacier  in the next Book why  Apollo  declines fighting with  Neptune  is because  Apollo  being the same with  Destiny  and the Ruin of the  Trojans  being concluded upon and decided that God can no longer defer it  According to this  Apollo  by taking the Part of  Troy  seems to have been Fighting against himselfBut  Diana  attach'd herself to the  Trojan  Interests we are let to know  because she presided over  Dancing  and those  Barbarians  were great  Dancers  it may be so and yet I am apt to think the Goddess of  Chastity  acts a little out of  Character  here and by aiding and abetting these  Dancers  Ravishers and Debauchees is in danger to be taken  tripping  As for  Latona  if she was  influenced by her  Children  she was a very  Dutiful Mother  and  Xanthus  being a  Trojan  River" is very Naturally and without  any  Design or Artifice of the Poet "interested for his Country"  Do you not begin to believe upon this Review of the Matter which I hope you will think a fair and impartial one that  this Division of the Gods in  Homer  was made much more at  random  than  Eustathius  would have persuaded you it was and that the Gods upon  Jupiter  's Permission to them to assist either Party in the Beginning of this Book gratified their  personal  Inclinations and AffectionsNay  Jupiter  himself supposes they had done and would do this  Celestial Pow'rs descend  And as your Minds direct your Succour lend  To either Host  L c B xx  And farther the Speeches which the Poet puts in the Mouths of his Gods when they come to engage are full of  personal  Invectives and Reproaches and contain little or nothing that countenances  an Allegorical Construction  Mars  puts  Minerva  in Mind of the Wound  Diomed  had given him thro' her Instigation  In thy frantick Mood  Thou drov'st a Mortal to insult a God  Thy impious Hand  Tydides'  Jav'lin bore  And madly bath'd it in celestial Gore  L c B xxi  Minerva  whom we may observe  Homer  represents in this Engagement as superiour to  Mars  in point of  bodily Strength  not by Virtue of any  Art  or  Stratagem  insults her vanquished Antagonist in the Language of a  Conquerour  instead of reproving his Rashness in a Style that would have better become the Goddess of  Wisdom  Hast thou not yet insatiate Fury known  How far  Minerva  's  Force  transcends thy own  L  The same Goddess next attacks  Venus  and easily overcomes her which Circumstance may I apprehend be best literally understood for in an Allegorical Sense  Venus  might have been at least a  Match  for  Minerva  as  Love  often takes Possession of the  bravest  Heart and is irresistible by the  wisest  CounselsAnd if  Venus  had been victorious here I make no Doubt but that Sense would have been put upon this Passage  Neptune  addresses himself to  Apollo  in a long Speech in which he recapitulates the injurious Treatment they had both met with from  Laomedon  and wonders at that God's Forgetfulness and Forgiveness of the same But he drops not a single Syllable that intimates himself to be the  Representative  of  Humidity  or  Apollo  of  Dryness  upon this Occasion  Juno  gives  Diana  most abusive Language and "Boxes her soundly" into the Bargain as Mr  Pope  expresses itbut I see no Clue to a Mystery in all this Business nor any Thing suitable to the  Emblematical  Characters of either Goddess  Lastly upon  Mercury  's declining to fight with  Latona  Mr  Pope  borrows this Remark from  Eustathius  that  See Note at L  It is impossible that  Mercury  should encounter  Latona  such a Fiction would be unnatural he being a Planet and she representing the Night for the Planets owe all their Lustre to the Shades of the Night and then only become visible to the World  This Commentator in another Place  See Note at L B xx  exclaims with Admiration  With what  Art  does the Poet engage the Gods in this Conflict  But sure if there be Truth in the last cited Observation there was little  Art  in making  Latona  and  Mercury  take different SidesIn short as exactly  See Note at L B xx  as some Circumstances may  tally  in the the Disposition of this Engagement I am apt to think upon the whole it is rather to be attributed to Chance than Design and that the Expositors in general either thro' Zeal for the Honour of  Homer  or in Ostentation of their own Sagacity have gone greater Lengths in their  Allegorical  Hypothesis than they could justify from the plain Scheme of their Author But I will take Occasion once more to resume this Argument  LETTER V  IT bears hard I presume upon the Notion of an allegorical Meaning's being couched under the Appearances and Actions of  Homer  's Deities that we are so often at a Loss for any Reason to be alledg'd for them or cannot give one with Consistency and Propriety If this did not abundantly appear to be the Case from what has been laid before you we might proceed to ask how it comes to pass that the Interposition of  Juno  in the  See B xvi L c  th Book prevents  Jupiter  's seeming Design to save  Sarpedon  Why does  she  interpose at all or why is this the Effect of it How comes  this  Goddess to interfere in the present Passage and  Minerva  in the  See B xxii L  d Book when  Jupiter  discovers the same Inclination to deliver  Hector    If  Eustathius  rightly observes that  the Conduct of  Homer  is remarkably just and rational  in the fifth Book of the  See L B v  Iliad  where he tells us  Diomed  notwithstanding his intrepid Character retired from  Apollo  because  it was impossible for him to vanquish  Apollo  in whatsoever Capacity he is considered either as the  Sun  or as  Destiny  how is it that the same Commentator commends in another Place a Conduct which is the very Reverse of this How  See Note at L B xvii  observable says he or rather Mr  Pope  in his Name is  Homer  's Art of illustrating the Valour and Glory of his Heroes  Menelaus  who sees  Hector  and all the  Trojans  rushing upon him would not retire if  Apollo  did not support them and though  Apollo  does support them he would oppose even  Apollo  were  Ajax  but near him  According to this Remark if it is reconcileable with the former  Menelaus  behaves with more  Intrepidity  or rather  Rashness  than  Diomed  himself and yet neither are the  Characteristics  of that Hero of whom we shall have something more to say by and by In the seventh Book  Apollo  we are informed  See Note at L B vii  comes very opportunely to save his favourite  Hector  who is overpowered by  Ajax  Eustathius  says that  Apollo  is the very same with  Destiny  so that when  Homer  says  Apollo  saved him he means no more than that it was not his Fate yet to die  Now methinks if this Observation is justly made this Deity should appear to the Relief of every Hero in the like Extremity And yet it is  Venus  who saves  Paris  in the third Book and  Aeneas  in the fifth as  Neptune  does the latter this same good Office in the twentieth  It belongs to the Advocates of the common Notion to solve all these Difficulties and many more that might be added to themIn the mean Time I would have you turn your Eyes to a Passage or two where the  Allegory  is supposed to be selfevident and tell me whether the Matter be so undeniably clear as the Illustrations of the Commentators pretend to make it The Descent of  Minerva  in the first Book to prevent  Achilles'  attempting the Life of  Agamemnon  is descanted upon at large as a Passage of this Nature  The  See Note at L B i  Allegory  here says Mr  Pope  may be allowed by every Reader to be unforced The  Prudence  of  Achilles  checks him in the rashest Moment of his Anger it works upon him unseen to others but does not entirely prevail upon him to desist till he remembers his own Importance and depends upon it that there will be a Necessity of their courting him at any Expence into their Alliance again Having  persuaded himself by such Reflections he forbears to attack his General but thinking that he sacrifices enough to Prudence by this Forbearance lets the Thought of it vanish from him and no sooner is Wisdom gone but he falls into more violent Reproaches for the Gratification of his Passion All this is a most beautiful Passage whose Moral is evident and generally agreed on by the Commentators  Now had  Minerva  only been the Actress in this Affair all this had been a very natural  Explication  but  Homer  gives us to understand that  Minerva  was  See L  dispatched by  Juno  the Goddess of  Honour  on this Errand If therefore  Juno  be not an utterly insignificant Personage in this Transaction the  Honour  as well as the  Prudence  of  Achilles  must be supposed to suggest his present Conduct to him But as a  Soldier  and a  passionate  one too no doubt he must think himself obliged in Point of  Honour  to take  immediate  Satisfaction for the Affront which had been put upon him and so his  Honour  suggests what his  Prudence  forbids As  allegorical  Persons therefore I can't think but  Juno  and  Minerva  appear together with  some Force  in this  Machine  Nor by the way does it seem agreeable to the Character of the Goddess of  Wisdom  to suffer  Achilles  to break out into such scurrilous and virulent Expressions  as he makes Use of in his next Speech to  Agamemnon  he does this when  Wisdom  is gone Mr  Pope  says but still it was by her  Permission  one might say  Direction  indeed  The Force of keen Reproaches let him feel  l  The Original is stronger and contains a more unlimited Commission and in consequence of it  Achilles  rates his General with a Vengeance  O Monster mix'd of Insolence and Fear  Thou Dog in Forehead but in Heart a Deer  l c  Even this Passage then you see is not clear of Difficulties and as much as may be said in Defence of the allegorical Interpretation the literal Sense is at least easy and liable to no Exception  I will only desire you to turn once more to the fifth Book of which Mr  Pope  observes  See Note at the End of B v  the Allegory lies so open is carried on with such Closeness and wound up with so much Fullness and Strength that it is a Wonder how it could enter into the Imagination of any Critic that  these  Actions of  Diomed  were only a daring and extravagant Fiction in  Homer  as if he affected the  marvellous  at any Rate The great Moral of it is that a brave Man should not contend against Heaven but resist only  Venus  and  Mars  Incontinence and ungoverned Fury    Nothing is more observable than the particular Care  Homer  has taken to shew he designed this Moral    Minerva  at the Beginning of the Battle is made to give this Precept to  Diomed Fight not against the Gods but give Way to them and resist only  VENUS The Hero himself as soon as he has performed her Dictates in driving away  Venus  cries out not as to the  Goddess  but as to the Passion  Thou hast no Business with Warriors is it not enough that thou deceivest weak Women  Even the Mother of  Venus  while she comforts her Daughter bears Testimony to the Moral  That Man  says she  is not long liv'd who contends with the Gods  And when  Diomed  transported by his Nature proceeds but a Step too far  Apollo  discovers himself in the most solemn Manner and declares this Truth in his own Voice as it were by direct Revelation  Mortal forbear consider and know the vast Difference there is between the Gods and thee  c  Now in the first Place I am afraid  Homer  will not appear to have been so  particularly  careful to shew he designed this Moral as Mr  Pope  would make us believe For though  Diomed  was commanded  in the Beginning of the Battle to give Way to the Gods and resist only  Venus  he is afterwards empowered to attack  Mars  and  any  Deity that should come in his Way  Not  Mars  himself nor  Ought immortal  fear  l  Accordingly he is directed in the  Original  to fall upon  Mars  See L of the th Book of the Iliad  first  and therefore though he  actually  attacks no other God he seems to have been sufficiently authorised to do it which is a Circumstance that clashes with the AllegoryBut what bears still harder upon it in my Opinion is this that though the Poet speaks in high Terms of the Bravery and Intrepidity of this Hero and of the Honour he had to be under the immediate Protection of  Minerva  yet he represents his wounding of  Venus  and contending with the heavenly Powers as Acts of the highest Rashness and Impiety Observe  Dione  's Words to her Daughter which Mr  Pope  refers to as a Proof of  Homer  's Intention to inculcate his Moral c  Rash impious Man to stain the blest Abodes  And drench his Arrows in the Blood of Gods  But thou tho'  Pallas  urg'd thy frantic Deed  Whose Spear illfated makes a Goddess bleed  Know thou whoe'er with heav'nly pow'r contends  Short is his Date and soon his Glory ends c c  l c  And if you will regulate your Opinion by  Virgil  's Judgment of this Matter you will find  Diomed  See Note at L  according to that Author as Mr  Pope  remarks  in his Answer to the Embassador of King  Latinus  enumerating his Misfortunes and imputing the Cause of them to this  impious  Attempt upon  Venus  Haec adeÃ² ex illo mihi jam speranda fuerunt  Tempore cum ferro coelestia corpora demens  Appetii Veneris violavi vulnere dextram  Aeneid l  Nay  Diomed  condemns himself for this very Action in his Speech to  Glaucus  in the next Book and intimates the great Danger he had exposed himself to by it  But if from Heav'n celestial thou descend  Know with Immortals we no more contend  Not long  Lycurgus  view'd the golden Light  That daring Man who mix'd with Gods in Fight c  B l c  I can't help transcribing to you Mr  Pope  's Note upon this Place who begins now to be of the same Sentiment  A quick Change of Mind from the greatest  Impiety  to as great Superstition is frequently observable in Men who having been guilty of the greatest Crimes without any Remorse on the sudden are filled with Doubts and Scruples about the most lawful or indifferent Actions This seems the present Case of  Diomed  who having knowingly wounded and insulted the Deities is now afraid to engage the first Man he meets lest perhaps a God might be concealed in that Shape  I confess this  Fear  of  Diomed  which violently shakes the Allegory in Question appears to me inconsistent likewise with the Tenor of this Hero's Character nor can I think Mr  Pope  brings him off when he acquaints us in the following Note that  what  Diomed  here says is the Effect of Remorse as if he had exceeded the Commission of  Pallas  in encountring with the Gods and dreaded the Consequences of proceeding too far At least he had no such Commission now and besides was no longer capable of distinguishing them from Men a Faculty she had given him in the foregoing Book He there mentions this Story of  Lycurgus  as an Example that sufficed to terrify him from so rash an Undertaking  Now in the first Place it by no Means appears that this Commission was expired or that Faculty ceas'd at least the contrary may be inferred from Mr  Pope  's Translation of this Speech  Diomed  says but two Lines above  Unhappy they and born of luckless Sires  Who tempt our Fury when  Minerva  fires  l  After all why should he torment himself with Reflections on what he had done only by Virtue of that  Commission  before which he was far from  exceeding except in his Attempt upon  Apollo  from whom however upon the first Reproof he retired Or why should the Example of  Lycurgus  who acted not by divine Impulse terrify one who confessedly did In this Light what will become of the  allegorical  Characters of  Minerva Mars  and  Venus  or how comes a Hero to be troubled in Conscience because he had been resisting  Incontinence  and  ungoverned Fury  Thus you find this Allegory which we were told lies so open is clogged likewise with its Difficulties from which indeed neither is the literal Construction of the Passage clear for it seems unreasonable that a Man should suffer from the Resentment of one God for what he committed by the Direction and Command of another though this is no unusual Thing in  Pagan  Story  Upon the whole to have done with the  Machinery  of this great Poet I leave it to you to judge whether there is not abundant Ground to conclude that the Interpreters have  frequently  taken Pains to ascertain a Meaning in him which never came into his Head that if he had a latent and symbolical Meaning at least they have not hit upon it and that there is more Ingenuity than Solidity as we have hinted in many of their Interpretations In a Word I cannot see how any thing like a regular and consistent System either of Theology or of Morality can be extracted  from  Homer  's  Machinery  if he drops a Sentiment or an Expression occasionally as he often does with a View one would think to convince his Reader of the Rectitude of his  private  Notions with Regard to the Deity his  Jupiter  appears to have been a  fabulous  and  traditional  Character and is drawn with Imperfections and Infirmities incompatible with the natural Ideas of a supreme Being As to the inferior Deities it seems impossible to form a precise Idea of their hidden Significancy or  allegorical  Importance from the Actions which we have seen ascribed to them So that  Homer  had really much  less Design  in the Plan of his Poem than is supposed on which Supposition he may however be plainly made more uniform and of a Piece or he had much  more  than has ever yet been or we may suppose  now  ever will be comprehended In my next I will consider in another Point of View the noble Production of this excellent Poet  LETTER VI  IT may be proper to remind you in this Place that I neither have said nor shall say any thing of  Homer  with an Intent to  lessen  your Opinion of him but to  set it right  for it is one Thing to undervalue a Poet and another to undeceive the Reader If  Homer  be justly esteemed one of the  greatest  Geniuses the World has produced  perhaps the greatest it is to be remembered that he is one of the  first  too and it is absurd to look for that Perfection in the  Original  which we have a Right to expect in the  Copy  It is the Characteristic of  Invention  to be  great  of  Imitation  to be  exact  and if  Virgil  could not have improved the Model of the  Epopee  left him by  Homer  he should not have taken a Pen in his Hand The  Intervention  of  Homer  with all his Defects will always be the Object of our  Admiration  the  Judgment  of  Virgil  with all his Proprieties will only deserve our  Praise  I own it has often amazed me to find the Commentators so confident to deny or solicitous to extenuate  Homer  's Defects which really do no Discredit to him and which ought to be imputed to that  Simplicity  with which every  original  Production of the human Mind is naturally imagined It is I apprehend for want of considering this great Author in this Light that the Expositors often run into the opposite Extreme and are industrious to discover Beauties and Excellencies which were merely accidental and ought rather to be put to the Account of the Editor's Affection or Sagacity than to that of the Art or Design of the AuthorUnder this Notion I have already submitted to your Consideration my Sentiments on  Homer  's  Machines  and agreeably to my Proposal I shall next give you my Thoughts upon the Plan or Oeconomy of  the  Iliad  in general and then proceed to a Review of the Poet's Conduct in some particular Instances Now I think it may be noted as a Defect in the general Oeconomy of the  Iliad  which is to be ascribed to the Cause just mentioned that the Poet has not taken sufficient Care to interest his Readers on the Side of his Countrymen notwithstanding the apparent Justice of their Cause This is clear to me from several Considerations as first from the Countenance and Protection given to the  Trojans  in general by  Jupiter  in Preference to the  Greeks  I am very sensible the Commentators represent this Protection as the Consequence  only  of that God's Promise to  Thetis  to humble the  Grecians  and do Honour to  Achilles  But is it not as plain too that  Jupiter  throughout the Poem is  personally  wellaffected to  Troy  in general and that for very good Reasons It appears from  Jupiter  's Answer to  Thetis  that he had declared himself in the Interest of the  Trojans  long before she made this Application to him  What hast thou ask'd Ah why should  Jove  engage  In foreign Contests and domestic Rage  The Gods Complaints and  Juno  's fierce Alarms  While I too partial aid the  Trojan  Arms  B l  And he afterwards in the Council wherein he intimates himself disposed to end the War with the  Approbation of the other Deities by suffering the Treaty made upon the Duel of  Menelaus  and  Paris  to take Effect expresses a more than ordinary Concern for  Troy  as a Place that deserved well at his Hands  For know of all the num'rous Towns that rise  Beneath the rolling Sun and starry Skies  Which Gods have rais'd or earthborn Men enjoy  None stands so dear to  Jove  as sacred  Troy  No Mortals merit more distinguish'd Grace  Than Godlike  Priam  or than  Priam  's Race  Still to our Name their Hecatomb's expire  And Altars blaze with unextinguish'd Fire  B L c  Mr  Pope  has a Note from  Dacier  which corroborates what I have remarked upon this Head  See Note at L B iv  Jupiter  's Reproaching these two Goddesses  Juno  and  Pallas  with neglecting to assist  Menelaus  in the Duel proceeds from the Affection he bore to  Troy  since if  Menelaus  had gained by their Help a complete Victory  which it has been observed was a sufficient one  the Siege had been raised and the City delivered On the contrary  Juno  and  Minerva  might suffer  Paris  to escape as the Method to continue the War to the total Destruction of  Troy  and accordingly a few Lines after we find them  complotting together and contriving a new Scene of Miseries to the  Trojans  The latter Part of this Note confirms what has been before observed that these Goddesses seem to have been actuated by a Spirit of the most inveterate Malice and Animosity against a whole Race  Unius obnoxam  The Restitution of  Helen  c was not the grand Object of their Counsels  Indeed if you take them in the Gross I believe you will find the Deities on the Side of  Troy  tho'  Mars  is in the Number to be more gentle and mercifully inclined than those that are the Assistants of the  Greeks  Again I can't help being of Opinion that upon the whole the Poet gives us a much more favourable Idea of the  Trojans  than he does of the  Greeks  if we regard the  Manners  and  Characters  of the Heroes concerned on both Sides Let us take a short Vew of the principal Personages that fight in the Cause of  Troy Hector  as Mr  Pope  says  See Note at L B iii  if he is not the chief Hero in the  Iliad  is at least the most amiable and is for several Reasons a favourite Character with every Reader    He stands in contrast to  Achilles  an accomplished Character of Valour unruffled by Rage and Anger and uniting his People by his Prudence and Example  It is the  Love of his Country which appears his principal Passion and the Motive of all his Actions He has no other Blemish than that he fights in an unjust Cause which  Homer  has yet been careful to tell us he would not do if his Opinion were followed  We may add that  Homer  having so many  Greeks  to celebrate makes them shine it their Turns c whereas  Hector  appears in every Battle the Life and Soul of his Party and the constant Bulwark against every Enemy he stands against  Agamemnon  's Magnanimity  Diomed  's Bravery  Ajax  's Strength and  Achilles  's Fury  See Note at L B v  The Piety and Valour of  Aeneas  tho' not drawn at so full a Length are marked no less in  Homer  the Original than in  Virgil  the Copy It is the Manner of  Homer  to express very strongly the Character of each of his Persons in the first Speech he is made to utter in the Poem In this of  Aeneas  there is a great Air of  Piety  in those Strokes  Is he some God who punishes  TROY  for having neglected his Sacrifices  and then in that Sentence  the Anger of Heaven is Terrible  In a Word as Mr  Pope  tells us in another Place  See Note at L B xx  Tho'  Aeneas  is represented a Man of great Courage yet his Piety is his most shining  Character This is the Reason why he is always the Care of the Gods c  The Character of  Sarpedon  says the same Commentator is the  See Note at L B xvi  most faultless and amiable in the whole  Iliad  This Hero is by Birth superiour to all the Chiefs of either Side being the only Son of  Jupiter  engaged in this War His Qualities are no way unworthy his Descent since he every where appears equal in Valour Prudence and Eloquence to the most admired Heroes Nor are these Excellencies blemished with any of those Defects with which the most distinguished Characters of the Poem are stained so that the nicest Criticks cannot find any Thing to offend their Delicacy but must be obliged to own the Manners of this Hero perfect His Valour is neither rash nor boisterous his Prudence neither timorous nor tricking and his Eloquence neither talkative nor boasting He never reproaches the Living nor insults the Dead but appears uniform thro' his Conduct in the War acting with the same generous Sentiments that engaged him in it having no interest in the Quarrel but to succour his Allies in distress This noble Life is ended with a Death as glorious for in his last Moments he has no other Concern but for the Honour of his  Friends and the Event of the Day    His is the only Death in the  Iliad  attended with Prodigies even his Funeral is performed by divine Assistance he being the only Hero whose Body is carried back to be interred in his native Country c    These peculiar and distinguishing Honours seem appropriated by our Author to him alone as the Reward of a Merit superiour to all his other less perfect Heroes  These are the most illustrious Characters on the Side of  Troy  tho' the inferiour ones if not so striking are at least generally amiable and inoffensive as those of  Deiphobus Helenus Polydamas  and  Glaucus  Even that of  Paris  is upon the whole far from being odious or disgusting I believe among other Things the Value every Reader has for these Characters particularly his Love and Esteem of  Hector  inclines his Wishes to the Side of  Troy  Indeed Mr  Pope  has perhaps undesignedly given us in the above Accounts of  Sarpedon  a kind of Contrast to the Manners and Characters of many of the Leaders in the  Grecian  Army For the Valour of  Achilles  and of  Diomed  is undoubtedly  rash  and  boisterous  the Prudence of  Ulysses  is sometimes  See Note at L B viii  timorous  and the Eloquence of  Idomeneus  and  Nector  is  talkative  and  boasting  But what Prejudices  us more than any Thing else against the  Greeks  is that Cruelty and Inhumanity which is so remarkable in their Chiefs of the first Note and Figure Granting  Achilles  in all he does to act in Character and suitably to his  ferocious and vindictive Spirit  the very Nature of the Character itself is offensive and the Propriety and Coherence with which it is preserved distasteful  His Inhumanity in dragging the dead Body of  Hector  has been severely and I think indeed not without some Justice says Mr  Pope  censured by several both Antients and Moderns  Indeed the Question is whether the whole Picture of  Achilles  as drawn by  Homer  has not stronger and more violent Features in it than Necessity required The Subject of the Poem is the Anger of this Hero and the ill Consequences of it to the  Greeks  but this brutal Treatment of the Body of a generous Enemy is neither the natural Effect of  that  Anger nor a Soldierlike Revenge for the Death of his Friend  Patroclus  'Tis true the Commentators have observed that  See Note at L B xvii  Homer  takes Care before Hand to lessen in his Reader's Mind the Horrour he may conceive from the Cruelty which  Achilles  will exercise upon the Body of  Hector  by shewing this Cruelty as the Punishment only of that which  Hector  exercises upon the Body of  Patroclus  he drags him he  designs  to cut off his Head and to leave his Body upon the Ramparts exposed to Dogs and Birds of Prey  The Observation is founded on Fact but however as this Piece of  intended  Cruelty is inconsistent with  Hector  's general Character he should not have been represented as capable of it and as it was only  intended  it makes not so horrible an Impression upon us as the  actual  Inhumanity of the Poet's favourrite Hero I have often thought by the way that the Barbarity of  Achilles  towards the Remains of the unfortunate and universally beloved  Hector  occasioned the Misrepresentation of the very Fact of his Death by the wellknown Story which  Shakespeare  adheres to in his  Troilus and Cressida  of  Achilles  's ungenerously attacking him unarmed and cutting him to PiecesSo desirous was the exasperated Author to depreciate the Character of this Hero and exalt that of his Adversary But to return be the Character of  Achilles  as "poetically perfect" as possible and the Morality to be drawn from it as obvious as you please he seems to have the least Merit of any of the principal Personages in the Poem and we can scarce help being sorry to see so many detestable Qualities on the right Side of the Question In a Word "the Virtues of Humanity" which he  See Note at L B xxiv  discovers in the th Book when  he restores the Body of  Hector  to  Priam  and "the amiable Qualities" which Mr  Pope  tells us  soften the terrible Ideas we have conceived of him  are exercised too late to wipe off the Stain of his past unheroical and unmanly Behaviour especially when we consider that this Act of Humanity was the Effect of  Jupiter  's express Command delivered by his Mother  Thetis  In short though we cannot but take Notice of a great deal of Insolence and Cruelty on both Sides and are shocked as Mr  Pope  confesses he is at the many Instances of Inhumanity that occur throughout the Poem  which however are not to be  See Note at L B vi  imputed to the Poet who followed Nature as it was in his Days but to be ascribed to the uncivilized Manners of those Times when Mankind was not united by the Bonds of a rational Society  yet I believe we shall find much more Blame due to the  Greeks  than to the  Trojans  upon this Score Not to insist upon those other glaring Proofs of a bloody and unmerciful Disposition which  Achilles  gives in the killing  Lycaon  See B xxi L c  taking twelve Captives whom he sacrifices afterwards to the  Manes  of  Patroclus  we see  Agamemnon  too upon certain Occasions betraying a fierce and cruel Temper as particularly when he prevails upon his Brother to take away a  Trojan  's Life which he was inclined in Compassion  to  See B vi L c  spare I do not know where you will meet with more savage Sentiments than those of this General in the following Speech to  Menelaus  Oh impotent of Mind  Shall these shall these  Atrides'  Mercy find  Well hast thou known proud  Troy  's perfidious Land  And well her Natives merit at thy Hand  Not one of all the Race nor Sex nor Age  Shall save a  Trojan  from our boundless Rage  Ilion  shall perish whole and bury all  Her Babes her Infants at the Breast shall fall  L c B vi  And if you will turn to the Original you will perhaps think it much softened in this Translation notwithstanding Mr  Pope  's Observation  See Note at L B vi  from Madam  Dacier  It should be remembered too that the venerable  Nestor  himself is a Spectator and Applauder of this Act of Cruelty  But there is one Consideration behind that interests the Reader in the Behalf of  Troy  much more than all the rest I mean that of the  private  Characters of  Priam  and his Royal Family Mr  Pope  is of Opinion that  the Poet's chief  See Note at L B vi  Intention in making  Hector  retire from the Battle to carry a Message to  Troy  c was to introduce the fine Episode of his parting with  Andromache  in which the  See Note at L  amiable Picture of conjugal Love  Homer  has drawn gives us Cause to think his Genius was no less capable of touching the Heart with Tenderness than of firing it with Glory  This Episode says that excellent Person tends very much to raise the Character of  Hector  and endear him to every Reader  and indeed we cannot admire this Hero more in the Field than we love him at Home His Conduct his Courage and his Valour are common to him with many others but his affectionate Tenderness to his Parents his Wife his Child and his Friends is characteristical and peculiar to himself  In a Word you cannot I believe but be a Wellwisher to the House of  Priam  when you consider the general Character of this good old Man himself whose only Fault was his Indulgence to his Children and especially his Piety which "renders him a Favourite of  Jupiter"  and procures him the Restitution of his Son's Body or when you look into the Manners of his whole Family not even  Helen  excepted but as she is the Mistress of  Paris  or  Paris  himself but as he is the Admirer of that fatal Beauty Upon the whole I leave you to judge whether the  Grecians  do not deserve the Appellation of  barbarous  according to the worst Acceptation of the Term much more than the People or the Allies of  Troy  I cannot think then with Mr  Pope  that  Homer  See Note at L B v  always appears very zealous for the Honour of  Greece  or even that he seems to be so in the Instance produced to support the Assertion I mean that of the  Trojans  in the Beginning of the third Book rushing on to the Battle in a barbarous and confused Manner with loud Shouts and Cries while the  Greeks  advance in the most profound Silence and exact Order  This Circumstance it seems is a Proof of the Poet's  Endeavour every where to represent the  Greeks  as superiour to the  Trojans  in Valour and the Art of War  to which if you add the Circumstance of  the  Grecians  being animated by  Pallas  and the  Trojans  instigated by  Mars  i e the former "by a wellconducted Valour" and the latter by "rash Strength and brutal Force" the Matter will bear no Dispute What Weight there is in this latter Circumstance you will easily see upon recollecting what has been already remarked upon the  Machines  of  Homer  and for the former I think you will agree with me that little is to be fairly inferred from it to the Advantage of the  Greeks  The  Trojan  Manner of encountering with Shouts and Outcries  is no Argument against their military Discipline or Proof that they were not drawn up in as "exact Order" as the  Grecians  themselves  See Note at L B iii  Perhaps these Clamours were only to encourage their Men instead of martial Instruments  as Mr  Pope  has not scrupled to intimate at least it is a Peculiarity as what Nation is without one that does no Discredit to their Discipline or Skill in the "Art of War" Indeed the supposed  constant  See Note at L B iii  Superiority of the  Grecians  c is by no means so apparent to me as it has been to the Commentators in general and probably you may be of the same Mind if you will refer to Book iv L c to Book viii L c to Book xi L c to Book vii L c c c and to other Places wherein there seems to be no Sort of Inferiority on the Part of  Troy  in respect of Conduct Bravery or Resolution More might be said upon this Article but I have exceeded the ordinary Bounds of my Letters and indeed should not have said so much but that I thought it necessary to enter into such Particularities as these in order to give you the clearer Idea of an Author whose Work I presume you will think it a rational Amusement thoroughly to examine and discuss  LETTER VII  I Have two more Objections to the general Oeconomy of the  Iliad  which I am apt to believe a little Attention will convince you are reasonable  ones the first is that  Achilles  the Hero of the Poem is not the first Personage in it in Point of Dignity  Hector  is his Superiour in every amiable Quality and  Agamemnon  no less so in Power and Command And as the former Consideration prepossesses the Reader in Favour of the  Trojan  General so the latter has at least a Tendency to interest us on the Side of Authority in the Quarrel at the Beginning of the Poem And the more so as  Homer  if he was not a Friend to absolute Monarchy does yet speak in very high Terms of the sacred Rights and inviolable Supremacy of Kings  There want not Chiefs in such a Cause to fight  says  Agamemnon  himself  And  Jove  himself shall guard a  Monarch  's Right  B l c  and afterwards  Hence shalt thou prove my Might and curse the Hour  Thou stood'st a Rival of  imperial  Pow'r  And hence to all our Host it shall be known  That  Kings  are subject to the Gods alone  l c  Old  Nestor  talks in the same Strain when he attempts to pacify these Chiefs see Line c as does  Ulysses  in the next Book see L c  But besides the visible Propriety there had been in making  Achilles  Commander in Chief with which Appointment the great Design of the Poem  and the due Execution of it were without Doubt consistent it is plain that for Want of it you will meet with much Incongruity not to say Absurdity in many Places One obvious Example shall suffice to maintain the Allegation which is that of  Achilles  's convening the Council in the first Book an Act of Royalty that became  him  no more than it would  Diomed Ulysses  or any  secondary  Commander in the Army Indeed this very Circumstance you find mentioned by Mr  Pope  in his Note from  Plutarch  and  Eustathius  as doing great Honour to the Judgment of  Homer  for which Reason it will be proper to transcribe it  Plutarch  observes how justly  Homer  applies the Characters of his Persons to the Incidents not making  Agamemnon  but  Achilles  call this Council who of all the Kings was most capable of making Observations upon the Plague and of foreseeing its Duration as having been bred by  Chiron  to the Study of Physick One may mention also a Remark of  Eustathius  in Pursuance to this that  Juno  's advising him in this Case might allude to his Knowledge of an evil Temperament in the Air of which she was Goddess  Now admitting the suppos'd Skill of this  Hero  c to have been a good Reason for his  private  Advice in regard to the Convention  of  this Council and for his delivering his Opinion  in  it with more than ordinary Freedom and Confidence  yet how it could give him a Right to call it or to open it in Consequence of so doing with a formal Speech I confess I can't at all comprehendYou will give me Leave just to illustrate what I have been observing upon this Head by directing you to a Passage in the th Book in which  Achilles  at the Height of his Glory and Popularity among the  Greeks  and at the very Instant that  he promises  See Note at L  Priam  a Cessation of Arms purely by his own Authority  does nevertheless in Effect acknowledge his Subordination to the Imperial Character and by his Apprehensions of the Consequences of the present Proceeding as if the Poet even while he is aggrandizing his Hero was conscious of ascribing an Importance to him unsuitable to the Inferiority of his Station  Then he Now Father sleep but sleep not here  Consult thy Safety and  forgive my Fear  Lest any  Argive  at this Hour awake  To ask our Counsel or our Orders take  Approaching sudden to our open'd Tent  Perchance behold thee and  our Grace prevent  Should such Report thy honour'd Person hear  The King of Men the Ransom might defer  But say with Speed if ought of thy Desire  Remains unask'd what Time the Rites require  T' interr thy  Hector  For so long we stay  Our slaught'ring Arm and bid the Hosts obey  L c  You observe there is an Inconsistency here which would have been saved had  Achilles  been the  principal  Person in respect of Precedence as well as Valour c c  But it is Time to come to the other Objection which as I am not singular in it I will give you in the Words of Mr  Pope  's Note prefixed to the d Book of the  Iliad  and endeavour to confirm it by a Remark or two upon what that Expositor has offered by way of Vindication of his Author  This and the following Book which contain the Description of the Funeral of  Patroclus  and other Matters relating to  Hector  are undoubtedly superadded to the grand Catastrophe of the Poem for the Story is compleatly finished with the Death of that Hero in the d Book Many judicious Criticks have been of Opinion that  Homer  is blameable for protracting it  Virgil  closes the whole Scene of Action with the Death of  Turnus  and leaves the rest to be imagined by the Mind of the Reader He does not draw the Picture at full Length but delineates it so far that we cannot fail of imagining the whole Draught There is however one Thing to be said in Favour of  Homer  which may perhaps justify him in his Method that what he  undertook to paint was the  Anger  of  Achilles  and as that Anger does not die with  Hector  but persecutes his very Remains so the Poet still keeps up to his Subject nay it seems to require that he should carry down the Relation of that Resentment which is the Foundation of his Poem till it is fully satisfied And as this survives  Hector  and gives the Poet an Opportunity of still shewing many sad Effects of  Achilles  's Anger the two following Books may be thought not to be Excrescencies but essential to the Poem  Virgil  had been inexcusable had he trod in  Homer  's Footsteps for it is evident that the Fall of  Turnus  by giving  Aeneas  a full Power over  Italy  answers the whole Design and Intention of the Poem had he gone farther he had overshot his Mark and though  Homer  proceeds after  Hector  's Death yet the Subject is still the  Anger  of  Achilles  Now I apprehend the  Anger  of  Achilles  which is the  Foundation of the Poem  is entirely distinct from that  Anger  or rather  Revenge  with which he  persecutes the very Remains of  Hector  and that the whole declared "Design and Intention" of the Poet was "to paint the  Anger  of  Achilles"  as the Source of all the Misfortunes the  Grecians  underwent which were ended by the Reconciliation of that Chief and  Agamemnon  We  then  see as plainly the  good Effects of Union to the  Greeks  as we  did  the fatal Consequences of Discord through the most considerable Part of the Poem and therefore the Death of  Hector  and the Triumph of the  Grecians  thereupon was the proper and natural Catastrophe of the  Iliad  The  Anger  of  Achilles  considered as the Passion he was  addicted  to might have been protracted through many Books moreIn short the Superaddition of these Books especially the latter instead of being justifiable by the Reasons above alledged does even come within the Reach of a former Objection For the Care taken of  Hector  's Body by two  See B xxiii L c  Deities the Debate in Heaven  See B L c  concerning the Redemption of the same by  Priam  the Interposition of  Jupiter  in Behalf of his deceased Votary  Mercury  's  See L B xxiv  conducting  Priam  to the Tent of  Achilles  the Interview of the two Monarchs and lastly the several pathetic Lamentations made over the Corps of the unfortunate Hero by his Friends and Relations at  Troy  with which the Poem concludes I say these Incidents confirm our former Prepossessions in Favour of  Hector  leave the most tender Impressions on our Minds and at the same Time inspire us with fresh Indignation at the Insolence and Barbarity of his implacable EnemySuch are the Defects as I conceive in the  general  Oeconomy  of the  Ilias  In my next I will communicate to you some Observations I have made upon the  particular  Conduct of the great Author in Relation to Characters Incidents and other Circumstances c c  LETTER VIII  HOMER  is with much Justice to be admired in the main for the agreeable Variety of his Characters and for the remarkable Spirit and Uniformity with which each of them is sustained If he is sometimes faulty upon this Article it is to be ascribed to mere human Infirmity perhaps or in some Cases to that Simplicity which as has been said distinguishes the  Inventors  of Arts and Sciences from the  Improvers  of them To one of these it is probably owing that we see such a scandalous Character as that of  Thersites  in the  Iliad  or so contemptible a one as that of  Nireus  The latter the most  beautiful  the former the most  deformed Person  of the Poem 'Tis observable Mr  Pope  informs us  that  See Note at L B ii  Thersites  is never heard of after his first Appearance Such a scandalous Character is to be taken no more Notice of than just to shew that 'tis despised  But whether ludicrous or scandalous Characters  ought to have Place in the  Epic  Poem may be justly  questioned  or whether it be a Beauty or Propriety to introduce a Person but  once  who seems to be utterly unworthy to appear at  all  As for  See Note at L B ii  Nireus  the Insignificancy of his Character should I think have excluded him from the  Iliad  who likewise makes his Appearance  once  too often The Truth is neither of these Personages are of any Service towards the Illustration of a  principal  Character The Caution with which the Courage of  Ulysses  is tempered sets off the Intrepidity of  Diomed  and the Activity of  Hector  is finely opposed to the  Immobility  of  Ajax  but the abovementioned Gentlemen are at best unnecessary Contrasts to each other and Foils to every Body elseBut that you may not imagine I am industriously looking after Objections and  picking  out Characters for the sake of finding Fault an Office I abhor I must desire you to look a little farther into a Character or two of much higher Rank which you will I believe find to be liable to the Objection of not being preserved with that Nicety of Consistence and Uniformity which is in general so Observable in this noble Writer If you will judge of the Character of  Menelaus  by the Idea which Mr  Pope  justly gives us of him  See Note at L B iii  who has taken some Pains to place it in a true Point of View you will be  I make no doubt of Opinion that  upon the whole his Character is by no Means contemptible tho' not of the most shining Nature He is called indeed in the th  Iliad  a  soft Warriour  or one whose Strength is of the second Rate and so his Brother thought him when he preferred Nine before him to Fight with  Hector  in the th Book  Thus far you may safely Subscribe to Mr  Pope  's Notion of this Commander but I am afraid what follows for the Display of the bright Side of this Character will clash rather too much with these Concessions made to his Disadvantage For how comes this  soft Warriour  whom you know I have mentioned before in another Light to discover a  Spirit of Revenge which distinguishes him from  all  the other  Greeks  in the second Book  No  See Note at L B ii  Leader in all the List is represented so eager and passionate he is louder than them all in his Exhortations more active in running among the Troops c c  If  Homer  meant to shew us hereby that  See Note at L B ii  his Concern in the War was personal while the others acted only for Interest or Glory in general  it is odd sure that he does not maintain this Priority of Zeal and Ardour as a consequence  of that Concern throughout the Poem Again is it not hard to Account for  his  See Note at L B vii and at L  Forwardness  to accept  Hector  's Challenge who immediately afterwards was not thought worthy even to take his  Chance  of fighting with him It may be said that  Agamemnon  dissuades his brother from the Combat from a Principle of Brotherly Love not from any Distrust of his Courage of which he appears to have so extraordinary an Opinion in the th Book when  Menelaus  is wounded by  Pandarus  that he expresses his Apprehensions  that the Death of that Hero will force the  Greeks  to return with shame to their Country  Depriv'd of thee the heartless  Greeks  no more  Shall dream of Conquests on the hostile Shore c  B L c  But if his Life was of such Consequence to  Greece  he should never have been stiled a  soft Warriour  or a Chief of the  second  Rate  I will only point out to what I think rather an Oversight than not in  Homer  with regard to another Character and then quit the present Article of Inquiry I mean the Character of  Ajax  whom not absolutely but comparatively speaking I can't look upon as a proper Person to be dispatched upon the Embassy to  Achilles  in the th Book Mr  Pope  however informs us  that the Choice of  three  See Note at L B ix  Persons  Phoenix Ajax  and  Ulysses  is made with a great deal of Judgment  Achilles  could not but reverence the venerable  Phoenix  c  Ajax  and  Ulysses  had been disgraced in the first Book L as well as he and were therefore proper Persons to persuade him to forgive as they had forgiven besides it was the greatest Honour that could be done to  Achilles  to send the  most  worthy Personages in the Army to him  Ulysses  was inferiour to none in Eloquence  but  to  Nestor Ajax  was second to none in Valour but to  Achilles Ajax  might have an influence over him as a Relation c  Yet as ingenious as all this may be 'tis certain that of all the Heroes  Ajax  was the worst  Orator  and so  far  at least he was was unqualified for the Charge in QuestionHe is by no means a favourite Character with the Poet himself if he had he would have  given him a Prize probably in some of the Games in the d Book  one Reason why he did not Mr  Pope  supposes might be because he had a Mind to shew that  Strength without Conduct is usually unsuccessful  which gives us no favourable Idea of this Hero and much less authorizes us to pronounce him one of the  most worthy Personages in the Army  that he was second to none  in  Strength  but to  Achilles  may be granted but in  Valour  he has no doubt many CompetitorsIn Truth I can't help looking upon this as a random Delegation notwithstanding a few plausible Circumstances which surely never entered the Author's Head viz the Disgrace of  Ajax  and  Ulysses  in the first Book c a Disgrace which by the way they neither of them resent or allude to in their Speeches to  Achilles  or the Relationship of  Ajax  to that Hero which he takes not the least Advantage of in his Address to himMr  Pope  in the Note last quoted appears therefore rather to have acted the Part of a ready Friend than an impartial CommentatorI will only suppose and have done that  Diomed  had been employed in this Deputation instead of  Ajax  in that Case can't you conceive Mr  Pope  would have expressed himself to the following Purpose  It is with wonderful Art and Propriety that  Homer  appoints  Diomed  one of the Embassadors upon this Occasion It did Honour to  Achilles  to send upon this Business the most valiant with the wisest of all the  Grecian  Commanders Besides  Diomed  See Note at L B v  has more of the Character of  Achilles  himself than any besides He has naturally an Excess of Boldness and too much Fury in his Temper forward  and intrepid like the other and running after Gods or Men promiscuously as they offer themselves Add to this that as he is forward to act in the Field so is he ready to speak in the Council where his Advice always inclines to War and is byassed rather on the Side of Bravery than Caution A Man of this Disposition was most likely to influence the Congenial Spirit of  Achilles  An Ingenious Commentator may take a thousand Occasions of making the most of his Author and convert Improprieties themselves into Beauties of which I believe I shall be able to give you a few more Proofs in my remaining Criticisms upon the  Iliad  of  Homer  LETTER IX  THE most material Remarks I have farther to make upon the particular Conduct of  Homer  c I shall communicate to you in Order as the Passages which seem exceptionable will occur in the Course of the Poem The first that offers itself is the Interposition of  Nestor  in the first Book in the Speech wherein he endeavours to make up the Breach between the contending Princes  Achilles  and  Agamemnon  which as the Design of the  Iliad  required it should be ineffectual I could wish he had spared Mr  Pope  observes  See Note at L B i  that the Character of Authority  and Wisdom in  Nestor  is every where admirably used by  Homer  and made to exert itself through all the great Emergencies of the Poem As he quiets the Princes here which how he does we shall see presently he proposes that Expedient which reduces the Army into order after the Sedition in the second Book When the  Greeks  are in the utmost Distresses 'tis he who advises the Building the Fortification before the Fleet c And 'tis by his Persuasion that  Patroclus  puts on the Armour of  Achilles  which occasions the return of that Hero c c  In these last mentioned Emergencies indeed the Authority of this venerable Hero has all the Weight you can desire but sure in the present Instance in which if it had prevailed all future Emergencies had been precluded it was exerted to no or at best very little Purpose The old Man is represented as Master of the Art of Persuasion and rises to speak with all the Advantages of the sweetest Eloquence and the Experience of two Generations and he seems accordingly to promise himself Success in the Proposal of an Accommodation  Young as you are this youthful Heat restrain  Nor think your  Nestor  's Years and Wisdom vain  Do you young Warriours hear my Age advise  Atrides  seize not on the beauteous Slave  That prize the  Greeks  by common Suffrage gave  Nor thou  Achilles  treat our Prince with Pride  Let Kings be just and sov'reign Pow'r preside  Let both unite with wellconsenting Mind  So shall Authority with Strength be join'd  Leave me O King to calm  Achilles'  Rage  Rule thou thyself as more advanc'd in Age  Forbid it Gods  Achilles  should be lost  The Pride of  Greece  and Bulwark of our Host  B i L c c c  But what Effect after all has this Oratory  Agamemnon  confesses that all he spoke was right  but he will not relinquish his Pretensions to  BriseÃ¯s  Achilles  promises not to fight for  BriseÃ¯s  but neither will he for his Country opprobious Language is given on both Sides  the Council dissolves  and the Calamities of  Greece  ensue For which Reasons I think  the Eloquence of  Homer  's  Nestor  is thrown out of Character by its proving unavailable  for the great End he designed itIf he had not spoken at all or upon offering to do it had been interrupted and prevented by the Fury of  Achilles  who seems to have less Veneration for him than  Agamemnon  that Hero had acted in Character and the Eloquence of the reverened Orator had never been exercised in vain  The next Objection I have to make is against the imprudent and unnecessary Measure taken by  Agamemnon  to sound the Disposition of the  Grecians  in the second Book by proposing the Return of the Forces to  Greece  a Proposal which had taken Effect but for the Management of  Ulysses  and  Nestor  It is likely indeed to give you the Words of  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  See Note at L B ii  who in Mr  Pope  's Opinion has given us an admirable Explication of this whole Conduct  Agamemnon  after his Quarrel with  Achilles  had nothing so much at Heart as to draw the  Greeks  to a Battle yet knew not how to proceed without  Achilles  who had just retired from the Army He was apprehensive that the  Greeks  who were displeased at the Departure of  Achilles  might refuse Obedience to his Orders should he absolutely command it In this Circumstance he proposes an Expedient to the Princes in Council which was that he should sound the Dispositions of the People by exhorting them to set sail for  Greece  but that then the other Princes should be ready to dissuade and detain themHe had some Cause to fear the  Greeks  had a Pique against him which they had concealed and whatever it was he judged it absolutely necessary to know it before he proceeded to a Battle He therefore furnishes them with an Occasion to manifest it and at the same Time provides against any ill Effects it  might have by his secret Orders to the Princes It succeeds accordingly and when the Troops are running to embark they are stopped by  Ulysses  and  Nestor  Now not to insist upon an inaccuracy in this Note i e that  Agamemnon  judged it Necessary to know  what  the Pique the  Grecians  had against him was  which if they had  any could  be no other than what arose from "their Displeasure at the departure of  Achilles"  as is expressed in the former Part of the Note I say not to dwell upon this the Question is whether this Stratagem was not absolutely superseded by the Vision sent by  Jupiter  to  Agamemnon  The Design of this Vision was to deceive him into the Hope or rather Assurance of taking  Troy  without the Assistance of  Achilles  And it had its Effect The General persuaded as it were by immediate Revelation of  Jupiter  's Favour towards him and Concern for his Glory and exalted with the Thought of the promised Success to his Arms communicates his Dream to the Princes in Council who appear to a Man to be satisfied of the Reality of it and of the Goodwill of  Jupiter  to the  Grecian  Cause Old  Nestor  gives his Advice in consequence of this Conviction  Princes of  Greece  your faithful Ears incline  Nor doubt the Vision of the Pow'rs divine  Sent by great  Jove  to him who rules the Host  Forbid it Heav'n this Warning should be lost  Then let us haste obey the God's Alarms  And join to rouze the Sons of  Greece  to Arms  B ii L c  Let me ask you now whether if this Dream had been communicated to the Troops as well as the Council  they  would not as readily have given Credit to it and have been impatient to follow to battle a Leader who was the declared Favourite of Heaven Would not the Belief of taking  Troy  in the next Attack under his Command have entirely removed the  Pique  they had conceived against him on Account of the Departure of  Achilles  if so as ingenious as the Stratagem in Question may be in itself and as artful as the Speech of  Agamemnon  is which he makes in pursuance of it it seems to be an Expedient to which as Things were then circumstanced he was not under the least Necessity nor in Prudence concerned to have Recourse  If you will next turn to the th Book I presume you will find an Inconsistency between  Hector  's very  particular  Prophecy of the Destruction of  Troy  and his Prayer for his Son immediately after as also the "strong Hopes  See Note at L B vi  and firm Assurance"  he often entertains  of raising the Siege by the Flight or Destruction of the  Greeks  Yet come it will the Day decreed by Fates  The Day when thou imperial  Troy  must bend  And see thy Warriours fall thy Glories end  And yet no dire Presage so wounds my Mind  My Mother's Death the Ruin of my Kind  Not  Priam  's hoary Hairs defil'd with Gore  Not all my Brother's gasping on the Shore  As thine  Andromache  thy Griefs I dread  I see thee trembling weeping captive led c  B vi L c  O thou whose Glory fills the Aetherial Throne  And all ye deathless Pow'rs protect my Son  Grant him like me to purchase just Renown  To guard the  Trojans  to defend the Crown  Against his Country's Foes the War to wage  And rise the  Hector  of the future Age  L c  Heard ye the Voice of  Jove  Success and Fame  Await on  Troy  on  Greece  eternal Shame  In vain they skulk behind their boasted Wall  Weak Bulwarks destin'd by this Arm to fall  Soon as before yon hollow Ships we stand  Fight each with Flames and toss the blazing Brand  Till their proud Navy wrapt in Smoke and Fires  All  Greece  encompass'd in one Blaze expires  B viii L c L c  I don't apprehend that what Mr  Pope  has urged from  Dacier  or advanced himself in order to salve this Inconsistency will afford us sufficient Satisfaction  We ought to reflect says he that this is only a Prayer  Hector  in the Excess of a tender Emotion for his Son intreats the Gods to preserve  Troy  and permit  Astyanax  to rule there It is at all Times allowable to beseech Heaven to appease its Anger and change its Decrees and we are taught that Prayers can alter Destiny  We are taught I conceive the very Reverse of this by the general Tenour of the Poem This Assertion however supposes  Hector  to have foreseen the Destruction of  Troy  and the Ruin of his Family and yet we are told in the next Sentence  that it cannot be inferred from hence that  Hector  had any divine Foreknowledge of his Fate c since in many following Passages we find him possessed with strong Hopes c to raise the Siege c  Is not this a sort of Confusion of Apologies and a Defence of one Inconsistency by another In short the direct and express Prophecy above quoted cannot without much Force be resolved into the mere  Apprehensions and Misgivings of a Soul dejected with Sorrow c by considering the great Dangers to which he saw all that was dear to him exposed  But to proceedThe Circumstance of  Jupiter  's weighing in his Scales the Fates of  Greece  and  Troy  in the th Book and those of  Hector  and  Achilles  in the d has something very striking and poetical in it but at the same Time is itself liable to the Objection made by  Macrobius  to  Virgil  's Imitation of it  Macrobius  says  See Note at L B viii  Mr  Pope  observes with some Colour that the Application of this Circumstance is not so just in  Virgil  as in our Author for  Virgil  had made  Juno  say before that  Turnus  would certainly perish  Nunc juvenem imparibus video concurrere fatis  Parcarumque dies vis inimica propinquat  So that there was less Reason for weighing his  Fate with that of  Aeneas  after that Declaration  But is it not as clear that the Fates of  Greece  and  Troy  and of  Hector  and  Achilles  in  Homer  were respectively to all Intents and Purposes declared before this Suspension of the Scales  Jupiter  in the Beginning of the th Book  threatens the Deities with the Pains of  Tartarus  if they assist either Side  he had in the End of the the preceeding  See L B vii  Book given Tokens of his Wrath against the  Grecians  and if we could doubt whether the Threatning just mentioned was denounced in favour of the  Trojans Minerva  's Request  "that she may direct the  Greeks  by her Counsels" must abundantly convince us that it was  From Fields forbidden we submiss refrain  With Arms unaiding mourn our  Argives  slain  Yet grant my Counsels still their Breasts may move  Or all must perish in the Wrath of  Jove  B viii L c  In the Case of  Hector Jupiter  is undeniably explicit he declares the Fate of that Hero approaching tho' he is inclined with the Consent of the inferiour Deities to rescue him from it  Consult ye Pow'rs 'tis worthy your Debate  Whether to snatch him from impending Fate  Or let him bear by stern  Pelides  slain  Good as he is the Lot impos'd on Man  So that  Virgil  appears at least not only to have copied this Circumstance from  Homer  but to have applied it with more Justice for what  Juno  said previously to the Suspension of the Scales is not at least so glaring an Impropriety as what  Jupiter  says here himself The best excuse perhaps for both these great Poets we may borrow from a Note of Mr  Pope  's in the th Book  See Note at L B xx  that it was not easy in the  Pagan  Religion to form the justest Ideas upon a Doctrine viz that of Destiny the Divine Power c so difficult to  be cleared and upon which it is no great Wonder if a Poet should not always be perfectly consistent with himself when it has puzzled such a Number of Divines and Philosophers  Before I quit this Remark I must just take Notice of an Oversight in Mr  Pope  who tells us in his Note  See Note at L B viii  upon the Circumstance of  Jupiter  's weighing the Fates c that  This  Figure  representing God as weighing the destinies of Men in his Balances was first made use of in Holy Writ  Are these only  figurative  Scales in  Homer  then Sure  Aeschylus  did not look upon them to be such when as Mr  Pope  informs us from  Plutarch  he wrote a whole Tragedy upon this Foundation which he called  Psychostatia  or the  weighing of Souls  In this he introduced  Thetis  and  Aurora  standing on either Side of  Jupiter  's Scales and praying each for her Son while the Heroes fought  I don't see therefore how any Parallel can reasonably be drawn between this Passage which must be  literally  understood in  Homer  and those  figurative  Expressions in  Scripture  of  being weighed in the Balance  and  found light  c by which the Impartiality of divine Justice is significantly illustrated to the human Understanding How  far  Milton  may be warranted in borrowing  this fine Fiction from  Homer  which it is acknowledged "he has admirably improved" or in representing the Deity with a Pair of golden  Compasses  in his Hand upon another Occasion it is not my present Business to inquireThus much at least may be said in his Behalf that  Boldnesses  give no Offence when there is no Allay of  Impiety  in them These Remarks shall be continued in my next  EETTER X  IN the  Note at L B xii  th Book of the  Iliad  we have an Account of a signal Prodigy which much awakens the Reader's Attention but I think never satisfies it I mean that of the Eagle with the Serpent in his Talons c which appears over the  Trojan  Army  Polydamas  See Note at L  upon duly considering it pronounces it to be a Warning to them from  Jupiter  not to attempt the  Grecian  Entrenchments that Day but to retreat c  He tells  Hector  too that what he delivers is not Conjecture but Science and appeals for the Truth of it to the Augurs of the Army  But notwithstanding all this  Hector  holds the Interpretation of the Omen in the utmost Contempt and insinuates that  the Advice proceeded not from the Skill but Cowardice  of the Interpreter He appears indeed to have been in the right not only from the Success of the  Trojan  Arms at the End of the Book when  Sarpedon  makes the first Breach in the  Grecian  Wall  and himself forces open one of the "Gates" but even from the Countenance and Assistance of  Jupiter  to the  Trojans  immediately after the Prodigy itself For the Poet tells us at the Conclusion of  Hector  's Speech to  Polydamas  and upon his "rushing to the Wall" L that  Jove  breathes a Whirlwind from the Hills of  Ide  And Drifts of Dust the clouded Navy hide  He fills the  Greeks  with Terror and Dismay  And gives great  Hector  the predestin'd Day  L c  Either therefore this Appearance had no Significancy in it and then it will be difficult to account for the Solemnity with which  Homer  introduces it or for his introducing it at all or else it boded Misfortune to the  Grecians  in which Case  Polydamas  who is every where shewn in a favourable Light enough makes if not a cowardly yet an ignorant Application of it  Macrobius  it seems  See Note at L    compares  Virgil  's Imitation of this Passage in the th Aeneid V c with the Original and  gives the Preference to  the latter on Account of  Virgil  's having neglected to specify the  Omen  Mr  Pope  takes Notice in another Place of this Author's Partiality to  Homer  and his Observation on this Circumstance is a strong Instance of it  He should have considered as Mr  Pope  remarks that  Virgil  had no Design or Occasion to make an  Omen  of it but took it only as a natural Image to paint the Posture of two Warriours struggling with each other  What Design or Occasion  Homer  himself had for an  Omen  in this Place you see 'tis not so easy to say you have however a Proof of the  Latin  Poet's  Judgment  and may observe that a needless or unintelligible  Prodigy  in  Homer  will make an excellent  Simile  in  Virgil  The Recess  See Note at L B xx  of the Gods in the th Book is an Incident which Mr  Pope  wonders all the Commentators should be silent upon it seems strange at the first View says he that so many Deities after having entered the Scene of Action should perform so short a Part and immediately become themselves Spectators  I must indeed look upon this as an Objection to the Conduct of the Poet Let us hear however what Mr  Pope  has urged in his Vindication He  conceives then the Reason of this Conduct in the Poet to be that  Achilles  has been inactive during the greatest Part of the Poem and as he  is the Hero of it ought to be the chief Character in it The Poet therefore withdraws the Gods from the Field that  Achilles  may have the whole Honour of the Day and not act in Subordination to the Deities besides the Poem now draws to a Conclusion and it is necessary for  Homer  to enlarge upon the Exploits of  Achilles  that he may leave a noble Idea of his Valour upon the Mind of the Reader  Now I would take the Liberty to ask whether it be derogatory to the important Character of  Achilles  to act in Subordination to the Deities Whether their Superintendency and Assistance has not been an Honour to every Hero in the Course of the  Iliad  particularly to  Diomed  in the fifth Book Whether  Achilles  himself makes so great a Figure in this Book as he does in the next when  Scamander  attacks him with all his Waves when  Neptune  and  Pallas  See L B xxi  appear to assist him  Simois  joins  Scamander  and at length  Vulcan  by the Instigation of  Juno  almost dries up the River  Does the Interposition of these Deities do a Discredit to the Valour of  Achilles  or  leave a less noble Idea of it upon the Mind of the Reader  than he would have had without itI dare say you will agree with me that what Mr  Pope  observes in the next Note is a kind of Answer to what he has advanced in this and be  convinced that the  magnificent Introduction of  Achilles  into the Field in the Beginning of this Book when the Gods descend to Battle and all Nature is in an Uproar is not answered by any suitable Exploits of that Hero or by any Atchievement worthy so pompous and terrible an  Apparatus  After the Gods are withdrawn  Achilles  and  Aeneas  meet but in the very Moment you expect to see a bloody Combat you are entertained with a tedious Conversation  Take Mr  Pope  's own Words  See Note at L B  Our Expectation is raised to see Gods and Heroes engaged when suddenly it all sinks into such a Combat in which neither Party receives a Wound and what is more extraordinary the Gods are made the Spectators of so small an Action What Occasion was there for Thunder Earthquakes and descending Deities to introduce a Matter of so little Importance Neither is it any Excuse to say the Poet has given us a Piece of  ancient History  we expected to read a Poet not an Historian In short after the greatest Preparation for Action imaginable he suspends the whole Narration and from the Heat of a Poet cools at once into the Simplicity of an Historian  I can't help asking here whether this be the first Time  Homer  is faulty in this Respect To acquiesce in Mr  Pope  's ingenious Justification of the  Interview between  Glaucus  and  Diomed  See Note at L B vi  in the th Book which has occasioned so much Censure I fear the Speech of  Nestor  to  Patroclus  in the th Book is equally blameable with the Conversation in Question  Machaon  is wounded  Achilles  who overlooked the Action from his Ship sends  Patroclus  to inquire whether it was he c That Hero has no sooner entered  Nestor  's Tent but he sees  Machaon  bleeding and is impatient to return to his Friend with the News upon this  Nestor  detains him in his Tent standing with a Speech greatly blameable for being too long he  See Note at L B xi  crouds Incident upon Incident and when he speaks of himself he expatiates upon his own great Actions very naturally indeed to old Age but unseasonably in the present Juncture c c c The Circumstances he mentions as they have no visible Allusion to the Design of the Speech seem to be unfortunately introduced In short I think they are not so valuable upon any other Account as because they preserve a Piece of  ancient History  c  Perhaps the Piece of  ancient History  preserv'd here is no more valuable than that which  Aeneas  leaves us in the above Conversationbut be that as it will it is methinks surprizing to find Mr  Pope  after having so impartially given up the Passage looking after Excuses and Pretences to palliate this Conduct  of his Author I will only mention one on which most Stress seems to be laid  It may not be from the Purpose to observe says our  English Homer  that  Nestor  might designedly protract the Speech that  Partoclus  might himself behold the Distress of the Army c whether this was the Intention or not it must be allowed that the Stay of  Patroclus  was very happy for the  Greeks  for by this Means he met  Eurypylus  wounded who confirmed him into a Certainty that their Affairs were desperate without  Achilles  's Aid  Did  Patroclus  want to be told this then after the Embassy to  Achilles  in the th Book or after  Achilles  had told him what he could not indeed be ignorant of when he dispatched him upon this very Message that  The Time is come when yon' despairing Host  Shall learn the Value of the Man they lost  Now at my Knees the  Greeks  shall pour their Moan  And proud  Atrides  tremble on his Throne  B xi L c  In short any Absurdity may be refined away if the present can and if it may be made to appear that the Length of  Nestor  's Speech the Interview of  Patroclus  and  Eurypylus  and the farther Delay occasioned by the former's Stay to cure the Wounds of the latter which might have been effected by another Hand were proper and well timed in this Place  Tis now no Season for these kind Delays  The great  Achilles  with Impatience stays  Thou know'st the fiery Temper of my Friend  L c  But to return to the Deities The magnificent Introduction of the Gods above referred to so much extolled by  Longinus  See Note at L B xx  seems to be the utmost Effort of  Homer  's prodigious Genius and after all perhaps we must ascribe their Recess so soon to the Poet's consciousness of the Inequality of human Nature to so exalted a Subject 'Tis certain the Sublimity of the Passage before us consists not so much in the Horrours of an actual Combat as in the dreadful Pomp of Preparation But you will desire to know what became of this supposed Consciousness in the next Book when the Deities are really described  engaging each other  To which I can only say that whatever induced  Homer  to attempt here what he seems to have declined before I am apt to think the Battle of the Gods the worst upon the whole that occurs in the Poem Mr  Pope  himself is much of the same Opinion you will naturally imagine in the following Remark upon it  See Note at L B xxi  I must confess I am at a loss how to justify  Homer  in every point of these Combats with the  Gods When  Diana  and  Juno  are to fight  Juno  calls her an  impudent Bitch  when they fight she boxes her soundly and sends her crying and trembling to Heav'n As soon as she comes thither  Jupiter  falls a laughing at her Indeed the rest of the Deities seem to be in a merry Vein during all the Action tho' Mr  Pope  should have excepted  Neptune  and  Apollo  from the first of which Gods we have another Piece of  antient History Pallas  beats  Mars  and laughs at him  Jupiter  sees them in the same merry Mood  Juno  when she had cuffed  Diana  is not more serious In short unless there be Depths that I am not able to Fathom  Homer  never better deserved than in this Place the Censure past upon him by the Antients that as he raised the Characters of his Men up to Gods so he sunk those of Gods down to Men  or even below them  Mr  Pope  is willing to believe however that an  Allegory  may be couched under all this and I wish any Body could discover it In the mean Time I can't but observe that 'tis great Pity the Gods and Goddesses that often appear so nobly in separate  Machines  throughout the  Iliad  should make so mean a Figure in the present Battle  I must request your Attention to one Incident more which Mr  Pope  would fain reconcile us to viz the Flight of  Hector  in the d Book I apprehend  that what that Commentator alledges from the  See Note at L B xxii  Conduct of  Virgil  who transferred this Passage to the Death of  Turnus  and likewise from the Doctrine of  Aristotle  is extremely insufficient for his Purpose  Turnus  is a Character much inferiour to  Aeneas  and therefore we are little shocked at his running away from him But this is confessedly not the Case the Point of mere Strength excepted with  Hector  when compared to  Achilles  It was you'll say that very Strength which he fearedwas it not that very Strength too which he had frequently encountered And if it was not  necessary  he  should  fly I will venture to say it is a Circumstance infinitely  disagreeable  to the Reader that he  does  Nor farther is "the Suffrage of  Aristotle"  himself if I understand it at all satisfactory upon this Point  The  wonderful  says he ought to have Place in Tragedy but still more in Epic Poetry which proceeds in this Point even to the  unreasonable  For as in Epic Poems one sees not the Persons acting so whatever  passes the Bounds of Reason  is proper to Produce the  admirable  and the  marvellous  For Example what  Homer  says of  Hector  pursued by  Achilles  would appear ridiculous on the Stage for the Spectators could not forbear laughing to see on  one Side the  Greeks  standing without any Motion and on the other  Achilles  pursuing  Hector  c c But all this does not appear when we read the Poem for what is  wonderful  is always  agreeable  and as a Proof of it we find that they who relate any Thing usually add something to the Truth that it may the better please those who hear it  What can we infer from all this but that the Flight of  Hector  round the Walls of  Troy  is an  Action  which as  such  will much better bear being  told  than represented No doubt of itbut is an Action all this while which is  unreasonable  in itself  therefore agreeable because  it may be  told  with Propriety Do we never  wonder  without  admiring  or  marvel  with  Disgust  as well as  Delight  I  will grant  this Incident renders this Part of the Poem more  astonishing  as  Aristotle  says in a subsequent Paragraph of Mr  Pope  's Note but why it is more  admirable  I am quite at a loss to conceive  What Mr  Pope  urges himself in Vindication of this Circumstance has much more Weight in it as  that  Hector  never thought himself a Match for  Achilles  that this Incident is prepared by Degrees as  Dacier  has observed too that the mere Sight and Voice of  Achilles  unarmed has terrified and put the whole  Trojan  Army into Disorder That  Hector  stays not that  he Hopes to overcome  Achilles  but because Shame c forbid him to reenter the City that he stayed by the immediate  Will of Heaven  irresistibly bound down by Fate That he had been reflecting on the Injustice of the War he maintained that his Spirits are depressed by Heaven That he flies not from  Achilles  as a mortal Hero but from one whom he sees clad in impenetrable Armour seconded by  Minerva  c c  which Considerations do indeed amount to a Proof of the  Probability  of  Hector  's Flight but I think are no Argument for the  Necessity  of it In short as Mr  Pope  himself says  he don't absolutely pretend to justify this Passage in every Point  I presume I may venture to say if  Hector  had stood his Ground we should have liked the Poem better for it  I can't think by the way that it is  a high Exaltation of  Achilles  that so brave a Man as  Hector  durst not  stand him  It would methinks have redounded more to  Achilles  's Glory had  Hector  been represented as a  Match  for him Indeed  this great Event wherein the whole Fate of  Greece  and  Troy  was decided by the Sword of  Achilles  and  Hector  does less Honour to that Hero than any one Action he had been engaged in for the last of the above Reasons alledged for  Hector  's Flight and besause  he  knew  that  Hector  was to fall by his Hand  He was assured of this by  Neptune  and  Pallas  in the st Book    Hector  alone shall stand his fatal Chance  And  Hector  's Blood shall smoke upon thy Lance  Thine is the Glory doom'd  L c  And again by  Minerva  just before his Engagement with  Hector  See L c B xxii  Nay he tells  Hector  himself  'Tis  Pallas Pallas  gives thee to my Lance  L  And yet Mr  Pope  inserts an Observation in â€  the th Book which he informs us ought to have been made before which is  that  Achilles  did not  know  that  Hector  was to fall by his Hand if he had known it where would have been the mighty Courage in engaging him in a single Combat in which he was sure to conquer The contrary of this is evident continues he from the Words of  Achilles  to  Hector  just before the Combat    I will make no Compacts with thee but one of us shall fall  But sure this Declaration is very consistent with the Knowledge of his future Success even tho' it had been less clearly ascertained to him  I hope these Remarks are sufficient to support my former Assertions in regard to  Homer  I shall just mention a few Particulars more in my next in order to make my Criticism as complete as I can under the present Form and to corroborate what has been repeatedly advanced and then take my leave for a Time of this noble Author  LETTER XI  IF you consider the  Iliad  of  Homer  with any thing of exactness of Attention you will perceive numberless Marks of a Genius thoughtless of or it may be superiour to the Niceties and Proprieties in which the Excellencies of secondrate Authors wholly consist To what has been offered already for the Illustration of this Truth you may add if you please the  Repetitions  with which  Homer  so much abounds I am far from asserting that these are never proper tho' they are often as Mr  Pope  confesses  See Note at L B viii  visibly absurd I will only point out one Place where it is owing to a  Repetition  that the very Design of the Author cannot easily be understood I mean the Speech of  Agamemnon  in the th Book wherein he proposes to the Generals to quit the Siege c  The Criticks  See Note at L B ix  are divided in their Opinion Mr  Pope  acquaints us whether this Speech which is Word for Word the same with that  Agamemnon  makes in the d Book be only a Feint to try the Army as it is there or the real Sentiments of the General  Mr  Pope  says  He does not pretend to decide upon this Point  nor is it indeed of any great Consequence any farther than as it makes good what has been remarked however that  Agamemnon  upon this Occasion spoke his real Sentiments is I think most probable because upon a Parallel one in the th Book he proposes the very  same Thing to the  Grecian  Princes tho' in different Words  Again it is in my Opinion more reasonable to put the frequent  Incongruities  we meet with in  Homer  to the Account of Inadvertency c than to reconcile them by forced and unnatural Constructions Thus  Minerva  who is always represented as prudently suppressing her Anger upon  Jupiter  's declaring himself for  Troy  does yet in one Place  See L c B viii  break out into as much Virulency of Language as  Juno  herselfThus  Neptune  in the same Book when  Juno  sollicits him to assist the  Greeks  rejects so desperate a Proposal with Indignation  What Rage what Madness furious Queen is thine  I war not with the Highest All above  Submit and tremble at the Hand of  Jove  B viii L c  But in the th Book he talks in a quite different Strain and seems determined to dispute the Superiority with  Jupiter  himself  What means the haughty Sov'reign of the Skies  Rule as he will his portion'd Realms on high  No Vassal God nor of his Train am I  Olympus  and this Earth in common lie  What Claim has here the Tyrant of the Sky c  B xv L c  Thus  Diomed  to give you one Instance more  is seized with Fear at the very Sight  See Note at L B xi  of  Hector  in the th Book for which Mr  Pope  gives us no other Reason than that  Diomed  had just told  us that  Jupiter  fought against the  Grecians  and yet in the th Book when that Deity  See Note at L B viii  personally interposes and throws a burning Thunderbolt at the Feet of this Hero's Horses  he can scarce prevail with himself to retreat  Thrice turn'd the Chief and thrice imperial  Jove  On  Ida  's Summits thunder'd from above  B viii L  It should be remembered too that at the very Time when  Diomed  is struck with this Panick the Poet tells us notwithstanding the Favour of  Jupiter  to  Troy  the Battle was doubtful  And level hangs the doubtful Scale of Fight  L  Nay at that Instant the  Greeks  were Victors  Ulysses  kills  Hypirochus  and  Hippodamus Diomed  slays  Agastrophus  and even gives  Hector  a Blow that stuns him and insults him afterwards c see from Line to It is needless to multiply such Examples  I should lastly be inclined to ascribe to the same Cause the frequent  Unsuitableness  of  Homer  's  Epithets  c which as they are sometimes distinctive and  specific  if I may so say so are they often general and applied at random  Priam  as Mr  Pope  himself has  See Note at L B vii  observ'd is stiled  when  he rejects the wholsome Advice of  Antenor  and complies with his Son  It is the  the  godlike Polydore  whom  Achilles  kills in the th Book and yet  See L B xx  this Hero is only the youngest Son of  Priam  was forbidden to fight and famous only for the Swiftness of his Speed c  To the forbidden Field he takes his Flight  In the first Folly of a youthful Knight  L  The Mention of these glaring Improprieties is abundantly sufficient for the Purpose else you might be directed to many more of the like  Sort  in almost any Book of the Poem Though they may not be improper in an equal  Degree  I have now finished my Remarks upon the  Iliad  of  Homer  with as much Accuracy I hope as was requisite and must leave it to your Consideration whether the common Opinion in respect of this Poet founded on the Interpretations and the Prejudices c of the Commentators be not on many Accounts an erroneous one If you will suppose this Author to have been not only the most  sublime  but the most  simple  too of all Writers you will I believe have a much more natural and ready Excuse for many of his Blemishes than the Shifts and Glosses of Interpreters  can supply you with Indeed these Defects in an original Author who was inspired with the Spirit of Poetry even to a Degree of Enthusiasm to which Inadvertency and Extravagance are essential will in a great Measure carry their Apology with themI have given you my Sentiments impartially and should take a much greater Pleasure in reviewing the Beauties of this admirable Poet than I have done in arraigning his Faults but Mr  Pope  to whom I refer you has illustrated these to more Advantage than I couldThe Practice of succeeding Writers of many Denominations is a Demonstration that we may find a great deal more in  Homer  to  imitate  than to  avoid  To convince you of my high Esteem of him and that I mean to part in Friendship with him I will finish with Part of that Translation from  Longinus  varying only and abating an Expression or two which concludes Mr  Pope  's Notes on the sixth Book  In our Decisions on the Characters of great Men c we must impartially confess that with all their Errors they have more Perfections than the Nature of Man can almost be conceived capable of attainingHe who commits no Faults is barely read without  Censure  but a Genius truly great excites  Admiration  In short the Magnificence of a single Period in one of these admirable Authors is  almost  sufficient to atone for all their Defects Nay farther if any  one should collect from  Homer  all the Errors that have escaped him they would bear but little Proportion to the many Beauties to be met with in  almost  every Page of his Writings 'Tis on this Account that Envy through so many Ages hath never been able to wrest from him the Prize of Eloquence c c which his Merits have so justly acquired An Acquisition which he still is and will in all Probability continue possessed of  As long as Streams in silver Mazes rove  Or Spring with annual Green renews the Grove  Mr  Fenton  LETTER XII  IN my former Letters I endeavoured to entertain you with some free but I hope just Remarks upon Mr  Pope  's Commentaries upon  Homer  If you please we will now take a short Review of that excellent Person's  Translation  of the same incomparable Author I must once more prevent your Surprize and perhaps your Indignation by declaring that I agree with all the World in allowing this to be in the main the best  Translation  that our or it may be any Language has produced If I think we might have had a better  Translation  in some few Respects I only mean that we might have had it from Mr  Pope  himself Nay I will go a Step further and grant you with much Satisfaction that this celebrated  Translator  always errs on the right Side and even when he does not do his Reader  Justice  never fails to do  Honour  to his  Original  I should rather say to  himself  for if Boldness of Figure Force of Expression Smoothness and Ease of Numbers and the Correspondence of Sound with Sense be the great Beauties of poetical Diction I should make no Scruple upon the whole to prefer the  English Iliad  to the  Greek  But these very Excellencies are in some Sort his Errors and what I admire in this  Poem  I can't help often considering as blameable in the  Translation  In short it is the  Overpoeticalness  of this  Translation  if I may so call it which I take to be exceptionable in many Place And yet as there was no Danger of so naturally a warm  Translator  's sinking into Flatness and Insipidity so one would have thought he had laid himself under Restraints sufficient to have prevented his ever soaring into the other Extreme of Rapture and ExtravaganceThere is not more  Fire  in any one Part of the  Translation  than there is good Sense and cool Reasoning in the following Extract from the  Preface  It should be considered what Methods may afford some Equivalent in our Language for the Graces of these viz the  Diction  and  Versification  in the  Greek  It is certain  no literal Translation can be just to an excellent Original in a superior Language but it is a great Mistake to imagine that a rash Paraphrase can make Amends for this general Defect which is no less in Danger to lose the Spirit of an Ancient by deviating into the modern Manners of Expression If there be sometimes a Darkness there is often a Light in Antiquity which nothing better preserves than a Version almost literal I know no Liberties one ought to take but those which are necessary for translating the Spirit of the Original and supporting the poetical Style of the Translation And I will venture to say there have not been more Men misled in former Times by a servile dull Adherence to the Letter than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent Hope of raising and improving their Author It is not to be doubted that the  Fire  of the Poem is what a Translator should principally regard as it is most likely to expire in his managing However it is his safest Way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole without endeavouring to be more than he finds his Author is in any particular Place 'Tis a great Secret in writing to know when to be plain and when poetical and figurative and it is what  Homer  will teach us if we will but follow modestly in his Footsteps  Where his Diction is bold and lofty let us raise ours as high as we can but where his is plain and humble we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the Censure of a mere  English  Critick Nothing that belongs to  Homer  seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just Pitch of his Style some of his Translators having swelled into Fustian in a proud Confidence of the  Sublime  Others sunk into Flatness in a cold and timorous Notion of  Simplicity  There is a graceful and dignified Simplicity as well as a bald and sordid one c'Tis one Thing to be nicked up and another not to be dressed at all Simplicity is the mien between Ostentation and Rusticity  If Mr  Pope  had always conducted his Translation conformably to these just Sentiments it would have been the most  exact  as it is now the most  Spirited  one extant But I believe you will by and by be convinced that he has often  modernized  his Original too much and sacrificed the true Simplicity of the Antients in general and the particular Air and Cast of his Author either to an Excess of Affection for him and Desire to set his Work in the most advantageous Light to the  English  Reader or to an undue Fear of lessening and injuring him thro' the Inferiority of our Language to the  Grecian  in many Respects To one or  both of those we are indebted I presume for many bold Strokes of Poetry and fine Pieces of Painting and Imagery which are not so much Copies of as Refinements on the Original  And by the Way it may be remarked that Mr  Pope  should have been more than ordinarily cautious upon this Article as he was under an absolute Necessity of  sinking  some Peculiarities in  Homer  's Diction which would not bear Transplanting into our  Tongue  Such are his  compound Epithets  and  Repetitions  How our  Translator  has acquitted himself with regard to these you will be best informed by consulting himself  See Preface to Mr  Pope  's  Homer  It is however to be observed in general that every Thing  characteristical  in an Author is as far as may be to be most religiously retained and that notwithstanding the allowed occasional Use of the  Periphrasis  or  Circumlocution  the  Transposition  of Words and the  Substitution  of one Expression in the Room of another c c by Means of which the Spirit of an Original is preserved without Prejudice to the literal Sense all imaginable Care is to be taken that these Liberties under the Pretence of maintaining and supporting this Spirit do not really overpower and extinguish it  Redundancies  are as  unoriginal  as  Insipidities  and the Spirit of an Author may be  as much overwhelmed in Exuberance on the one Hand as it evaporates in Frigidity on the other  Fire  and  Water  are scarce more opposite than Mr  Pope  's  Translation  of the  Iliad  and that of the  Aeneid  by Dr  Trapp  I am apt to think we shall often form very wrong Ideas of these Poems if we regulate them by these respective Translations for Mr  Pope  seems to have exalted the true Simplicity of  Homer  as "graceful and dignified" as it is in the same Degree that the  Doctor  has debased the Majesty of  Virgil  You will begin to think it high Time I should make good this Charge which I shall accordingly endeavour to do by pointing to a few select Passages out of Numbers that might be produced in which you will plainly discover certain  Boldnesses  and  Prettynesses  for you must gratify me in the Use of that Term for them and very frequently a Mixture of both that were taken from the Storehouse of Mr  Pope  's own Imagination and are utterly foreign to and destructive of the plain Scope and unaffected Spirit of his Author  There is not perhaps in all the  Iliad  a more pompous Description than that of  Achilles  arming himself in the th Book The Comparisons and Images as Mr  Pope  well observes  rise in a noble Scale one above another the Hero is set in a still stronger Point of Light than before till he is at last in a Manner covered over with  Glories he is at first likened to the Moonlight then to the Flames of a Beacon then to a Comet and lastly to the Sun itself  But with all this Sublimity and almost  Enthusiasm  there is a Simplicity which is I conceive lost in that Exaggeration of Imagery with which the Translator has embelished the Passage The whole Description which is too long to be transcribed is rather loosely paraphrased perhaps than otherwise but the Parts I have marked are so many beautiful Excrescencies which have no Sort of Warrant from the Letter or most of them even from the Import of the Text  His Limbs in Arms divine  Achilles  drest  He grinds his Teeth and  furious with Delay  O'erlooks th' embattled Host and hopes the bloody Day  Next his high Head the Helmet grac'd behind  The  sweepy  Crest hung  floating  in the Wind  Like the red Star that  from his flaming

will be at the Pains of comparing these Transcripts with the Original I believe you will think that the very  Figure  in the  Greek  which occasioned that Observation    my Spear is Mad  hardly ranks higher than the  Major  Part of those which I have quotedI will conclude this Letter with repeating one general Remark that Mr  Pope  by improving and embellishing a simple Hint in his Author and raising pompous Superstructures upon plain Foundations and by too frequently giving a loose to his own Fancy has in many Places rather  poetically paraphrased Homer  than  translated  him  LETTER XIII  AS there are certain  heterogeneous  and  unhomerical Boldnesses  in Mr  Pope  's  Translation  if you will permit me to call them so so there are several  Prettynesses  as has been hinted which I presume will fall under the same Denominations The following are a few of the most remarkable  O'er the Vale descends the living Cloud  B ii Ver  Fainter Murmurs dy'd upon the ear  B ii Ver  Groves  of Lances  glitter in the Air  B ii Ver  All the War descends upon the Wing  B iii Ver  As when the Moon refulgent  Lamp of Night  O'er Heavn's  clear Azure spreads her sacred Light  When not a Breath disturbs the  deep Serene  And not a Cloud o'ercasts the  solemn Scene  Around her Throne the vivid Planets roll  And Stars unnumber'd gild the glowing Pole  O'er the dark Trees a yellower Verdure shed  And tip with Silver ev'ry Mountain's Head  Then shine the Vales the Rocks in Prospect rise  A Flood of Glory bursts from all the Skies c  B viii Ver  Not those  fair Steeds  so  radiant  and so  gay  That  draw the burning Chariot of the Day  B x Ver    The  deaf Echo rattles round the Field  B xii Ver  Silence that spoke  and  Eloquence of Eyes  B xiv Ver    Discourse the  Med'cine of the Mind  B xv Ver  Thick undistinguish'd Plumes together join'd  Float in one Sea and wave before the Wind  B xvi Ver  the whirling Car  Smoaks thro' the Ranks  o'ertakes the flying War  B xvi Ver  As the young Olive in some sylvan Scene  Crown'd  by fresh Fountains with  eternal Green  Lifts the gay Head in snowy Flow'rets fair  And  plays and dances to the gentle Air c c  B xvii Ver  And shot the  shining Mischief  to the Heart  B xix Ver  Now Twilight  veil'd the glaring Fall of Day  And clad the dusky Fields in sober Gray  B xxiv Ver  These last cited Verses put me in Mind of Mr  Pope  's Descriptions of the Morning throughout this  Translation  which one only excepted see Ver B are much more  elegant  and  picturesque  than their Counterparts in the Original  Now from forth the  Chambers  of the Main  To  shed  his  sacred Light  on Earth again  Arose  the golden Chariot of the Day  And  tipt the Mountains with a purple Ray  B vii Ver  Aurora  now  fair Daughter of the Dawn  Sprinkled with  rosie Light  the  dewy Lawn  B viii Ver    Soon as Morning  paints the Fields of Air  B viii Ver  The  saffron  Morn with  early Blushes spread  Now rose refulgent from  Tithonus'  Bed  With  newborn Day  to gladden mortal Sight  And  gild the Courts of Heav'n  with sacred Light  B xi Ver c  Soon as  Aurora heav'd  her  orient  Head  Above the Waves that  blush'd with early Red  With  newborn Day  to gladden c  The Affectation of Poetry in all these Places has diffused an Air over Mr  Pope  's  Translation  quite different from the neat but generally unornamented Style of his Author to which the inexpressible  simplex munditiis  of  Horace  may pertinently enough be applied It is owing to this that we meet with such  figurative  Expressions as these  Around his Head an  iron Tempest rain'd  A  Wood of Spears  his ample Shield sustain'd  B v Ver  To which we may subjoin a Multitude of others similar to them throughout the  English Iliad    as  bristling Lances  the  steely Circledark Show'rs of Jav'lins  the  Tide of Combat  the  Stream of Fight  the  Tide of War  the  wooden Tempest  the  rocky Show'r  the  living Flame  or  Fire  the  Tide of TrojansLife's purple Tide  c c c in the free and unlimited Use of which the  Translation  is I apprehend little justified by the Original  I have often thought it was with the same View to  Ornament  c c that Mr  Pope  wrote his  Translation  in Rhime However what Advantages were hereby gained we shall see presently but it is certain in the mean time that by the Use of it the Translation becomes absolutely  modern  and in its very  Form unlike  the Original Mr  Dryden  says in his Dedication prefixed to his  Translation  of the  Aeneid  that he who can write well in Rhime may write better in blank Verse  and that  Rhime is a Constraint even to the best Poets and those who make it with most Ease that what it adds to Sweetness it takes away from Sense and that it often makes us swerve from an Author's Meaning  I wish by the by Mr  Dryden  had not asserted one Way and  translated  anotherIt is plain the  Superfluities  complained of in Mr  Pope  are in a great Measure to be imputed to this Method of  Translation  I believe you have had some Instances of this already but the following are notorious ones  He ceas'd his Army's loud Applauses rise  And  the long Shout runs echoing thro' the Skies  B iii Ver  Fierce  Discord  storms  Apollo  loud exclaims  Fame calls Mars  thunders and the  Field's in Flames  B v Ver  Great  Agamemnon  bids the  Greeks  forbear  They  breathe  and  hush the Tumult of the War  B vii Ver  And in his Hands two steely Jav'lins wields  That blaze to Heav'n and  lighten all the Fields  B xi Ver  In vain he calls the Din of Helms and Shields  Rings to the Skies and  echoes thro' the Fields  The brazen Hinges fly the Walls rosound  Heav'n trembles roar the Mountains thunders all the Ground  B xii Ver  I have purposely selected these Verses because excepting the mark'd  Redundancies  which the  Rhime required  they are as  close a Translation  as any in the whole Performance Mr  Pope  no doubt was sensible of this Inconvenience naturally inseparable from  Rhime  but he supposed probably the Advantage gained thereby in point of Smoothness and Harmony would make sufficient Amends for it Of all Things he would not have his Author thought  unpoetical  though there are certainly many Passages in him which as Mr  Pope  himself occasionally acknowledges are  not made to  shine in Poetry  It would be tedious to pick out all these and therefore I will only for Illustration's Sake transcribe a very remarkable one in which a most simple unadorned Narration of  Homer  consisting of a List of  proper Names  and those even without  Epithets  for the far greater Part is by Virtue of Mr  Pope  's  Adjuncts Circumlocutions  and  Rhimes  transformed into as  poetical  and entertaining a Description as most in the  Iliad  The circling  Nereids  with their Mistress weep  And all the  Seagreen Sisters of the Deep  Thalia Glauce ev'ry watry Name  Nesaea mild  and  Silver Spio  came  CymothÃ¶e  and  Cymodoce  were nigh  And  the blue Languish of soft Alia's Eye  Their  Locks Actaea  and  Limnora rear  Then  Proto Doris Panope  appear  Thoa Therusa Doto Melita  Agave gentle  and  AmpithoÃ« gay  Next  Callianira Callianassa  shew  Their  Sister looks Dexamene  the  slow  And  swift Dynamene  now  cut the Tides  Icera  now the  verdant Wave divides  Nemertes  with  Apseudes lifts the Head  Bright Galatea quits her pearly Bed  These  Orythia Clymene  attend  Moera Amphirome  the Train extend  And  black Junira  and  Junassa fair  And  Amatheia  with her  amber Hair  B xviii Ver c  This whole Passage which makes so  pretty  a  Figure  in Mr  Pope  's Hands if literally I mean fairly translated and that too in  blank  Verse would undoubtedly be very flat and spiritless  Then  Proto Doris Panope  appear  Thoa Pherusa Doro Melita  are more just  Translations  than any two Lines of the whole Number though they have neither  Fire  nor  Fancy  in them In such Places as these  Rhime  may among other Expedients help to save the  poetical  Character of an Author by giving a  seeming  Equivalent for  Spirit  in  Sound  But why must a  Translation  be beautiful and poetical when the  Original  is not soIt is the Business of a  Translator  to give us the  whole  of an Author not at  all  Events to make the  best  of himI will venture to say that had Mr  Pope  obliged the World with a  blank  Verse Translation of  Homer  at the same Time that he would have  more  effectually preserved the  Air  he would have deviated  less  from the  Sense  of his Author and that his Version upon the  whole  would have been as poetical as animated and even as harmonious as the present Dr  Trapp  observes I think very justly in his  Preface  to the Aeneid that  blank Verse is not only more majestic c but more musical and harmonious than Rhime It has says he more  Rhime  in it according to the ancient and true Sense of the Word than  Rhime  itself as it is now used For in its original Signification it consists not in the tinkling of Vowels and Consonants but in the metrical Disposition of Words and Syllables and the proper Cadence of Numbers which is more agreeable to the Ear without the jingling of like Endings than with it  After all the  Measure  in  blank  Verse does  really  and specifically distinguish it from  mere  Prose and if so  Rhime  is not wanted for this Purpose Nor can it be pretended that the strong  Colours  of Poetry the Beauties of Description Figures Images c c are capable of being displayed to more Advantage in  Rhime  than in  blank  VerseIndeed  these  are not peculiar even to Poetry they are independent on  Metre  and derive not Energy or Strength but Gracefulness only and Dignity from  Numbers  They are  fitter  for  Verse  than  Prose  but not more  essential  to itThus the bold  Figures Similies  and  Thoughts  c of  Homer  would be of the same intrinsic Value out of  Measure  as in itas the Holy Scriptures by the way though literally translated in plain  Prose  are in numberless Instances  poetical  though they are by no means a  Poem  It is not for the sake of  Lustre  but  Order  that Diamonds and Pearls are ranged upon a StringBut to return to Mr  Pope  Whatever Credit his  Translation  may have done the Original by heightening  and improving it in some Respects by Means of  Rhime  and thereby skreening sometimes a Simplicity or perhaps a Flatness and Frigidity of Diction which  Homer  only was answerable for 'tis as true too that it sometimes by Reason  only  of the  Rhime  falls short of it and is less beautiful and significant in itself Mr  Pope  is very happy in his Imitations of those Passages where  Homer  "applies the Sound to the Sense" see particularly B i Ver c B x Ver c B xiii Ver c B xiii Ver but he would have succeeded still more in these Places I presume had he been uncumbered with the Shackles of  Rhime  How much better and stronger would the following Lines have appeared without  Rhimes  than with them  First march the heavy Mules securely  slow  O'r Hills o'er Dales o'er Crags o'er Rocks they  go  Jumping high o'er the Shrubs of the rough  Ground  Rattle the clatt'ring Cars and the shockt Axles  bound  Loud sounds the Axe redoubling Strokes on  Strokes  On all Sides round the Forest hurls her  Oaks  Headlong Deepechoing groan the Thickets  brown  Then rusling crackling crashing thunder  down  B xxiii Ver  In spite of the Roughness and  Unmusicalness  of this excellent Description there is to me a certain Evenness and an Harmony in the Tone of the  Rhimes  which  alone  renders it inferior to the Original itselfTo conclude I will upon the Strength of these Observations put two Questions to you which you may determine at your Leisure whether a  blank  Verse  Translation  is not like to be more  faithful  to its Original than one in  Rhime  and whether Mr  Pope  would not have been a  better Translator  if he had not been so  good  a  Poet  LETTER XIV  AFTER reading my last you will not wonder to hear me wishing  Rhimes  were utterly banished from  Great Poetry  by which the Critics understand the  Epopee  and the  Drama  How far they may be requisite or even beautiful in  Lyric Elegiac Pastoral  c or especially  Didactic Poetry  I shall not enquire but 'tis certain they are in general rather Obstructions than Helps towards the great Purposes of firing the Heart and moving the PassionsYou need only read over your  Milton  and the best  Tragedies  of  Shakespeare  to be convinced of thisAnd if I would have ev'ry  FirstRate Original  Poem written in  blank  Verse for the Sake of the  Ear  as well as the  Heart  I must still more strongly recommend the Use of the same to  TranslationsRhime  is so abhorrent from the  Air  and  Genius  of the antient Poetry that nothing but the absolute Necessity of  it can I think render it dispensable in an  English  VersionNow  convenient  it may sometimes be but it is never  necessary  Whatever are the Imperfections and Defects of our Language they are it is my Opinion such as  Rhime  tho' it may  disguise  can never  supply  But I would exclude  Hypocrisy  from  Poetry  as well as  Religion  and confess for my own Part that I had much rather see a  Translation  in  some  Places  inferior  to its Original than unlike it in  all  If upon the  whole  not only the very  Cast  but the Sense and Spirit of an Author may be better preserved in  blank  Verse than  Rhime  every reasonable Critic will make Allowances for the Poverty and natural Inferiority of our Mother Tongue Mr  Pitt  's Translation of the  Aeneid  is a very noble one tho' I cannot conceive what induced him to give it us in  Rhime  unless it was the Apprehension of the Inequality of our Language to the Diction of his Author where it is most plain and unpoetical Indeed  Purity  and  Manliness  are the chief  Characteristics  of  Virgil  as  Fire  and  Vivacity  are those of  Homer  for which Reason I should imagine the latter a more  attemptable  Author than the former if Mr  Pope  had not precluded every Undertaking of this Nature even tho' he wrote in  Rhime  For bold  Figures  strong  Paintings  and beautiful  Colourings  may be ransfused from one Language  to another but  Purity Simplicity  and  Elegance  tho' they are the same things in all Tongues are not equally striking in them allHowever no  Translation  can go farther than the  Genius  of our Language will admit and even with regard to  Virgil  it will go I am inclined to believe far enough to convey a  strong  Idea of this noble Original in  all  its Parts It will go farther at least without  Rhime  than with it Dr  Trapp  indeed than whom no Body better  understood  his Author by too superstitious an Adherence to the  Letter  and particularly a fruitless and perpetual Endeavour to retain the  Brevity  of  Virgil  is cold and languid upon numberless Occasions and has thereby perhaps contributed more to the Disreputation of  blank  Verse than any other Writer He was offended and not without Reason with the  Licentiousness  of Mr  Dryden  's Translation but his  squeamishness  has carried him into the other Extreme for if Mr  Dryden runs away  from  Virgil  the  Doctor  is  tied to him  There is by the by this observable Difference between Mr  Dryden  's Deviations from  Virgil  and Mr  Pope  's from  Homer  that those of the latter are always uniform graceful and beautiful and if they are not  Homer  's  Thoughts  are at least  worthy  of him whereas Mr  Dryden  is apt to dwindle into a kind of  Puerility  which was but too natural to him that is altogether unsuitable to the  Gravity  and  Dignity  of  Virgil  Between this  Translator  then and Dr  Trapp  there lay a  middle  Way which Mr  Pitt  has judiciously taken and religiously pursued to the immortal Glory of  Virgil  to his own infinite Honour and the Credit of our Language Notwithstanding all this I think he has left Room for a  Translation  of  another Kind  as Dr  Trapp  says of  his  when compared with Mr  Dryden  's by writing in  Rhime  I attempted some time ago for my own Amusement to translate some of the  Speeches  in the first Book of the  Aeneid  into  blank  Verse from a Notion that  Virgil  if he had been born in  England  and in this present Age  as Mr  Dryden  expresses himself would have spoken  something  like such  English  as I flattered myself I could speak for himI have ventured to send you a few  Specimens  which for your Satisfaction I could wish you diligently and impartially to compare with the several  Translaions  and with the  Original  itself  L  Mene incepto desistere victam c  And am I then subdued must I desist  From my avow'd Design and fails my Pow'r  To drive from  Latium  's Coasts the Prince of  Troy  The Fates it

heaps of Arms distilling Blood  Bound with an hundred Links of knotted Brass  And bellowing grind his Jaws besmear'd with Gore  You have in these few Passages in the Original a Sample sufficient to regulate your Idea of  Virgil  's Style in general by which as Mr  Dryden  justly remarks is eminent for its  Clearness it Purity its Easiness and its Magnificence to which we must add no doubt that which can rarely be transferred with any tolerable Grace into our Language viz its Brevity  How far these Translations do justice to the Original as far as may be in regard to all these Particulars or whether equal Justice can possibly be done to it by Rhime from the very Nature of it I now leave it with you to judge and am  Yours c c  FINIS
