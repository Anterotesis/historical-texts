RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD HARROWBY  MY LORD  ALBINA had the honour of being known to your Lordship almost from her infancy Her faults and her graces You are already acquainted with as she grew up in some measure beneath your Lordship's eye She is now arrived at maturity and if in her present state my Lord you should find her more polished than when she had last the honour of your attention it is chiefly owing to the hints with which you then favoured me  I have the honour to be My LORD Your Lordship's grateful And obedient humble Servant H COWLEY  PREFACE  THE very favourable reception with which the Pieces I have presented to the Stage have been honoured by the Public has given them the appearance of great success and it is probable that those who were witnesses of their reception will be surprised to find this Tragedy prefaced by complaints of hardship and injury and to know that it has been productive of a train of mortifications and disappointments to its Author  It is with the utmost reluctance that I feel myself compelled to enter into the disagreeable circumstances which preceded the representation This is however necessary as I now present a Tragedy which I presume to call  original  to the cooler inspection of the Reader though I know that the principal circumstances of the plot and the leading traits of character have appeared in other Plays previous to the representation of this  The idea of writing for the Stage struck me by mere accident and the  Runaway  was my first literary attempt of any kind I am as ready as the severest Critic can wish to admit that it has all the crudeness of a first attempt It succeeded however on the Stage far beyond my most sanguine expectations and during its run which was stopped by the Benefits was one of the most profitable Plays both to the Author and Manager that appears on the records of the  Treasurybooks  at either HouseA success so encouraging opened a new prospect of advantage to my Family which I have since pursued with alacrity but this success closed with the unfortunate period in which Mr  Garrick  resigned the management of DruryLane  When Mr  Sheridan  obtained a share of the Patent I flattered myself that I had some right to his attention as Author of the last piece which was produced by his able Predecessor but the first Winter in which he commenced the management my Comedy to use the technical term was  shelf'd  The vanity of a young Author was piqued and I wrote to Mr  Sheridan  in the civilest terms I could to remonstrate on the occasion but of my letter not the least notice was taken As I was not then informed of Mr  Sheridan  's general neglect of letters I considered this slight as a particular insult to me especially as the Comedy was not played again that year but by command of their Majesties and for the benefit of Performers I therefore selt myself under a  necessity of presenting my Tragedy at CoventGarden but as I had some reason to dread Mr  Harris  's opinions it was presented to him in the Summer of by a Lady of Rank with the name and sex of the Author concealed After several weeks of anxious expectation it was returned peremptorily rejected I then waited on him and avowed the unfortunate Piece but had little reason to flatter myself with the circumstances of my reception Mr  Harris  to d me that there was no hope from alteration that the Play was unfit for the Stage and that he was convinced it never could be made fit he disliked the whole idea of  Gondibert  's situation and thought every incident of the Fifth Act inadmissible as he believed no audience would hear it The last part of this opinion surprised me as I had conceived the Fifth Act was the principal strength of the Piece but I was compelled to submit Nor is its  rejection  the injury of which I complain had the ashes of my Tragedy rested undisturbed I might have mourned over them but I would have mourned in silence  The Tragedy of  Percy  was soon after announced I attended its representation with anxious curiosity at this Play had been approved by that judgement which had decided so severely on mine At the opening of the Piece I was much concerned to see an old English story attempted though it bore little resemblance to the legendary tales of  Percy  and  Douglas  and that so much was said of Chivalry and of expeditions to the Holy Landcircumstances which though finely calculated for the Stage had been much neglected by our Poets in favour of the tales of Greek and Roman antiquity Yet as the Crusades are common historical facts I could only consider my being in some measure anticipated as unfortunate But I can hardly describe my astonishment or distress when I saw  Raby  the Father of the Heroine appear in almost the same situation with  Westmoreland  and resent his Soninlaw's imputation on the honour of his Daughter in a train of ideas exactly similar to those which I had given to the Father of  Adina  and that he even spoke several lines nearly verbatim which will be found on comparing the two Tragedies  I learnt from the Papers of next day that  Percy  was a Translation from a Tragedy called  Gabrielle de Vergy  written by M  Belloy  I was soon after informed by persons who had read the original for I am unacquainted with the language that in M  Belley  's Tragedy there is  no Father  I had remarked indeed during the representation that  Raby  seemed to have no connection with the plot he was out of the way during all the business of the Play and returned just time enough to challenge the defamer of his Daughter and to call himself her Champion which however neither introduces nor retards a single event  Various were my conjectures on this occasion but prudence suggested a cautious silence as I had still hopes at DruryLane Mr  Sheridan  received me infi  itely better than I expected and regretted that I had not brought my Piece before as Mr  Jephson  and Mr  Craddock  had each a Tragedy promised for the next Winter which must put it off another Season but assured me in the most explicit terms that no other Tragedy should come before it provided it was proper for the Stage which he added in a very polite manner he had no doubt of He soon after received my Farce of  Who's the Dupe  with equal frankness and promised that it should be brought out in the best part of the Season as some recompence for the delay of my Tragedy More than satisfied happy with my prospects I had only to regret that I had misapprehended his neglect of my letter and caused myself so many uneasy hours  The  Law of Lombardy  was soon after put into Rehearsal and I learnt with great surprise that it bore a resemblance to  Albina  in the conduct of the Piece though not in the Story or Characters I was greatly alarmed at the idea of more anticipation which whether accidental or otherwise was destructive of every prospect of reputation or advantage to me This resemblance was mentioned to Mr  Sheridan  and I thought myself happy when by his interposition Mr  Harris  was prevailed on to read the Tragedy on the suggestion that some alteration had been made and they acknowledged that if both Pieces were entitled to the Stage the only means of doing justice to both was to bring them out at the same time at different Houses otherwise the novelty of one of them must be destroyedand the idea of Rival Tragedies might be as advantageous as that of Rival Actors had been on some particular occasions This matter of very anxious expectation was suspended near a month as Mr  Sheridan  met with great difficulty in finding the Copy of the Tragedy In the meantime the speaking Pantomime of the  Touchstone  was brought out and as I was then in great goodhumour with Mr  Harris  I had a pleasure in endeavouring to suggest some useful alterations and was happy when he accepted the new scene of  Lady Fashion's Rout  which I considered as an earnest that he intended to accept the Tragedy Mr  Sheridan  at length found  Albina  and I attended him by appointment On this occasion I waited three hours which was rather longer than he had ever made me wait before he came at length with the Tragedy in his hand and I feel myself too much flattered by what he then said to omit it whatever length it may add to my tale  He made a thousand apologies and in apologies for negligence Mr  Sheridan  is remarkably easy and successful but said he had brought the best in his hand which was my Tragedy saying  "I have now read every word of it I was determined  not to see you 'till I had and this it is that has kept me so long Before I enter into particulars I will tell you that I think your Tragedy a very good one it will do you much honour and be of service to the Theatre"  On my acknowledgements he added  "Upon my word I really think what I say and without a compliment I am surprised that such a Tragedy could have been refused Mr  Harris  must have seen it when his head was full of other business if he had read it attentively he could not have refused it This Tragedy has a right to the Stage it must and  shall  be done"  The Tragedy was then opened and Mr  Sheridan  shewed me several indentings against lines which he wished me to consider He said the Characters were very strongly drawn and the Story interesting and frequently pointed out passages which on account of the Poetry or the Thought he was pleased to admire The only objection of importance was that he thought  Gondibert  should not see or mention the Bridal Bed in the last Scene but on my attempting a timorous defence he added  "Don't alter this or any other passage unless it strikes you as it does me  you  ought to be tenacious  every original Writer must give up passages with difficulty it is only Translators and Borrowers who are so ready to comply with every hint that is proposed"  The judgement pronounced by Mr  Sheridan  made me particularly happy as Mr  Harris  had promised the same morning that he would be guided by Mr  Sheridan  's opinion who said he would give the Tragedy to Mr  Harris  himself and tell him what he thought of it This was adding favour to favour and my thanks I believe sufficiently expressed my sentiments  Mr  Harris  a few days afterwards took my Tragedy as he imagined into the country but on opening it found that Mr  Sheridan  had by mistake given him a Comedy This occasioned another week's suspence it was then however obtained and read and I had scarce a doubt considering every circumstance that it would be put into immediate Rehearsal  All my hopes were however confounded by Mr  Harris  's persevering with inflexible steadiness in his former opinion He said there had been no material alterations which was certainly true and that it was still his opinion that the Tragedy could never be made fit for the Stage When he was reminded that Mr  Sheridan  entertained a very different opinion of it he replied  "I don't believe he has read it he may have dipped into it but I am convinced he has not read it through"  This was afterwards discussed in the presence of both when Mr  Sheridan  assured Mr  Harris  that he had read the whole and that it was his opinion it ought to be done but Mr  Harris  remained inflexible  When I next saw Mr  Sheridan  it was on the subject of my Farce He observed me dispirited and kindly taking my hand said  "Never mind 'em you and I will shew that  we know  a good Tragedy"  This Farce Mr  Harris  had offered to take and put into immediate Rehearsal but as I had then no doubt of its being played in an advantageous part of the season at DruryLane I had no inducement to change the House for which it was intended  Who's the Dupe  however in consequence of repeated breaches of appointments and promises was not produced till the middle of the Benefits when it could not have a regular run and I was then to pay an Hundred Guineas Thirty of which had been added by the present Managers for the chance of a Benefit at a time when the current business of the Theatre would not produce that Sum  The pecuniary disappointment I did not consider as material in this instance as I hoped that the applause with which the Farce was uniformly received would have put an end to the difficulty of getting my Pieces on the Stage which was infinitely more harrassing to my mind than the labour of producing them I was however soon after greatly hurt to hear that Mr  Sheridan  evaded the subject when it was accidentally men  ioned and advised me to write a ComedyIt was necessary for this purpose that I should have some Comic ideas and  they  were all completely driven from my mind by the vexations I had undergone I had indeed made some progress in writing a Piece founded on Turkish manners the Scene of which is laid in Asia and slattered myself with success from the novelty of the attempt but it lies and must lie in its present state till I have reason to believe it will meet with a fair and candid reception from the Theatres  Mr  Craddock  's Tragedy was then preparing for rehearsal and the parts given out but another Play of Miss  More  's was discovered to be nearly finished and Mr  Harris  was so eager to bring it out though it was then near the conclusion of the season that she has said he would hardly give her time to finish it There was only one capital Actress at either House who would undertake a new part in May and though she belonged to DruryLane she was cast in Miss  More  's Pray at CoventGarden in consequence of the levelling power of the Coalition and Mr  Craddock  's Play was put off 'till next season  Another Play by Miss  More  alarmed me greatly The terror of suffering again what I had felt at  Percy  induced me to write to her in much agitation a d I am sorry that I was prevented f  om sending that Letter and induced to believe it was impossible that the same palpable resemblance could again happen Under this conviction I attended the representation and heard with astonishment  what appeared to me to be every essential circumstance in the Plot and Character of my Play and to observe that it was changed principally in those places which had been objected to in mine In  Orlando  as in  Gond  bert  the action springs from Love which took its rise in a situation wherein Hope was impossible though the object is changed from the Widow of his Brother to the betrothed Mistress of his Friend  The character and offices of  Editha  were given though the sex was changed From the same motive of aggrandizing his fortune though without the same stimulus of a degraded situation he worms himself into the considence of the despairing Lover and persuades him that he is secretly beloved by  Isabella  whilst she receives the addresses of another  Orlando  breaks into a rhapsody similar to that of  Gondibert  persuades himself he had seen many proofs of that concealed passion and gives himself up to the guidance of his artful Counsellor which produces a catastrophe that is nearly the same  Orlando  in the dark intending to stab  Rivers  by a fortunate mistake stabs  Bertrand  and the principal situation of the catastrophe is produced exactly in the same manner in both Plays which is by the critical entrance of the person supposed to be murdered The greater part of this however passes behind the scenes in  Fatal Falsehood  by which the dramatic effect is weakened but the principal objections made to mine are removed The character of the Sister of  Rivers  and other parts of the Play differ from mine but there is a scene between the Father and his Daughter on her being rejected by  Orlando  that bears the same resemblance in the literal expression to the scene between  Westmoreland  and  Albina  in the fourth Act of this Play as the scene in  Percy  did to that between him and  Edward  How all these wonderful resemblances happened it is impossible for me to knownor do I know that Miss  More  ever saw my Tragedyit was in Mr  Garrick  's possession under the name of  Edwina  soon after the conclusion of the season in which he he left the Stage about which time I have since been informed Miss  More  was an inmate at Hampton and that the Play afterwards called  Percy  was then translating My Tragedy was afterwards in Mr  Harris  's Closet at the same time with  Percy  and again nearly at the same time with  Fatal Falsehood  I know that Managers are continually employed in giving advice and in suggesting alternations to Authors and I have frequently heard before I had any experience in this anxious warfare of the danger when once an idea is afloat in the Theatrical Hemisphere of its getting into other plays Amidst the croud of Plots and Stage Contrivances in which a Manager is involv'd  recollection  is too frequently mistaken for the suggestions of  imagination  Should it after all appear to the Public that there is nothing more in these repeated resemblances than what may be accounted for by supposing a similarity in our minds and that by some  wonderful  coincidence Miss  More  and I have but one common stock of ideas between us I have only to lament that the whole misfortune of this similarity has fallen upon me and as in this case we must continue writing in the same track it seems reasonable that we should have our productions brought forward in turn instead of which Miss  More  has had two Tragedies brought out both of which were written since mine whilst I struggled for the representation of this in vain But as there seems to be little hope of my obtaining this or any other favour from the Winter Managers I presume at least that as I do not pretend to provewhat it is impossible for me to knowthat Miss  More  ever read or copied me that it will be admitted that I have not copied her had I not been able to ascertain the fact that my Tragedy was written long before  Percy  and  Fatal Falsehood  appeared no proof would have been required beyond their extreme similarity that I had been guilty of the grossest Plagiarism  I now found myself deprived of all hope of  Albina  's appearing to the Public as an Original Play yet I still conceived myself sure of its being represented at DruryLane the next Season but I soon after accidentally learnt that Mr  Sheridan  had promised another Tragedy and as Mr  Craddock  's had been put off I well knew that three would not be donethis with his evading the subject and saying that he thought Mr  Harris  would still do it reduced me to the disagreeable necessity of asking an explicit declaration when I heard with inexpressible astonishment  "That he neyer intended to do the Play at DruryLane and that the next Season was engaged to Mr  Craddock  and another Gentleman"  On being reminded of his promises and encomiums he said  "It was still his opinion that the Tragedy was a very good one that it ought not to have been refused and that he had proposed to prevail on Mr  Harris  after all to bring it out but as this had been improperly mentioned to Mr  Harris  there was now an end of it"  I was then charged with having pieced conversations together which Mr  Sheridan  said should never happen again and from the whole of his behaviour it appeared to me that he meant this to close his doors against me  This most injurious and unaccountable conduct appears to me to be the effect of that coalition of the Theatres which by uniting the interests and prejudices of the Managers deprives an Author of all hope after a Piece has been rejected by  one  Had Mr  Sheridan  been unconnected with CoventGarden I have no doubt from the opinion he conceived of my Tragedy but that it would have been brought out in a most advantageous  manner Ideas of rivalship which is the natural and proper effect of two Houses would have been as favourable to me as their union has been ruinous  The morning succeeding my interview with Mr  Sheridan  Mr  Colman  was asked to bring out a Tragedy for me at the Haymarket which both the Winter Managers had refused His answer was  When an Author of reputation thinks proper to bring me a Piece I don't think I have a right to deliberate If Mrs  Cowley  invites the Town to a Tragedy at the Haymarket I am only the Midwife to give it a safe delivery to the World when one does not know a Writer it is different  This candid and liberal answer I have great pleasure in recording The Tragedy when read drew an approbation not less warm from Mr  Colman  than from Mr  Sheridan  and it was not merely praise Mr  Colman  put it into immediate rehearsal for which I think myself under the highest obligation as Tragedy is inconsistent with the sportive Genius of the  Haymarket  and there was little hope of advantage equal to the expensive preparation of a regular Tragedy It was however presented with no other alteration than the curtailments which were necessary on account of the length where the time of representation is shorter than in the Winter Theatresand with the disadvantage of having one of its principal  Editha  since given to Miss  Sherry  Characters performed in a style which excited laughter yet it was received with a degree of applause for which I should be ungrateful were I not vain of it  Had I taken up my pen merely in pursuit of applause I should have been completely gratified but this though so ostentatiously held out as the motive for productions in the Poetic line has seldom in any age or country produced works of any considerable reputation Dramatic Writers in particular have always sought for support from their labour which is too great to be undertaken for amusement This may appear a vulgar topic but to me it is a very serious subject of complaint that by the conduct of the Winter Managers I have been deprived of a reasonable prospect of several hundred pounds and have spent years of fruitless anxiety and trouble My productions have been uniformly received by the Public with applause yet I find the doors of the Winter Theatres shut against meTo this severe fate I most reluctantly submit  PROLOGUE  The first part of this Prologue which was intended for Mr  Parsons  was not spoken on the Stage

ALBINA  And will in duty mourn  Nay had Albina's heart forgot the virtues  Which made her Lord so worthy of its love  Yet still she dares not slight the laws of custom  Nor to licentious tongues give themes for slander  WESTMORELAND  Enough to custom and to grief thou'st giv'n  Wilt waste thy blooming youth in widowhood  Because some months you bore the name of Wife  ALBINA  I have not sworn to

this guise  Of coy reserve yet to a Father's eye  Your mind should now appear as legible  As in the days of prattling infancy  Raimond deserv'd the tribute of your tears  And you have wept a deluge to his  manes  Consider now the brave the youthful Edward  The prize for whom contending beauties strive  His name and wealth amongst the first are rank'd  And he stands high in royal Henry's favour  ALBINA  I know his merits and I know his love  Nay I will own that when my dying Lord  From Palestina wrote he gave me charge  That if again the holy marriage bonds  I e'er should wear that I should chusebeyond  All others chusehis Friend the noble Edward  But did not bid me hymeneals sing  Upon his turfless grave  WESTMORELAND  Then sing his dirge  And with it join Lord Edward's who'll perchance  Be soon entomb'dvictim alike of love  And war  ALBINA  Say you my Lord  WESTMORELAND  I say my Lady  That in three days Edward returns to Palestine  Our Royal Master hath on him bestow'd  The levies for the Holy War from which  He'll ne'er return save he leaves you his Wife  ALBINA  Can this be trueOr do you mean to try  If in my heart there is not hid more love  For Edward than modesty would own  WESTMORELAND  Truly not  Modesty hath not wove so thick a shade  As to conceal your love To Holy Land  He surely goesIn triumph to return  Or hopeless dieAlbina must decree  ALBINA  Then coy reserve and women's arts adieu  Danger tears off the veil  Oh spare my burning blushes whilst I own  Edward is dearer to Albina's heart  Than fame or conquest to the bever'd soldier  WESTMORELAND  Well said my child  ALBINA  When on Lord Raimond you bestow'd my hand  E'en then the image of the blooming Edward  Made dutyto my heartan arduous task  But virtue aided my devoted mind  Whilst Raimond's worth and manly tenderness  Had I believ'd converted all my love  'Till freedom taught that virtue had but  hid  Not  rased  the deep impression  WESTMORELAND  Well may my heart be proud of such a daughter  Oh the pute transportThe exalted joy  By fav'ring Heaven for  parents  minds reserv'd  When in the fiery combat of the passions  Their children rise victorious from the trial  By honour ledby sacred virtue crown'd  To thee I give a Child's most glorious meed  to Albina  To thee I give a Father's grateful thanks  ALBINA  Alas my Lord you much o'errate a duty  In which to fail were grosswere deadly shame  WESTMORELAND  The best reward Albina now awaits thee  Thy Edward loves theeloves with fervent truth  Yield then thy hand to him who wears thy heart  Let me tomorrow greet Lord EdwardSon  ALBINA  Oh grant a longer spacea few short days  To cheer the sadness from my widow'd brow  Lest I insult the blissful marriage feast  With pensiveness illsuited to the day  WESTMORELAND  Within three days Edward must England quit  Must quit the land where Peace and Beauty reign  For hostile camps and scenes of savage war  Tomorrow then consent to be his Bride  Tomorrow bless the Man thy Country honours  A Father'tis a Father asks the boon  ALBINA  The boon my Father ask'd my heart or lips  Have never yet denied tomorrow then  Since you my Lord commandtomorrow's sun  Beholds Lord Raimond's Widow

heart  Thee more than age or ugliness I dread  Who gives thee place a ruthless serpent bosoms  To poison her repose and snare her virtue  Thou merciless dost wreck the virgin's fame  Shadowing all her chearful morn of life  As dreary vapours veil the bright Aurora  Folding in dismal gloom the springing day  The curse pronounc'd on disobedient woman  In love is wrap'd inflicted and fulfill'd  ALBINA  Oh 'tis all false Thou dost profane the source  From whence our blessings spring  The heart untouch'd by love is like a lute  Whose pow'rs the master never hath call'd forth  Or with unskilful finger struck harsh discords  Yet touch with truth the strings and harmony will flow  And tones mellifluous enchant the ear  Filling with melting music empty space  When these effusions of a  female  heart  Thou canst with patience bearEditha find me  Exit▪  EDITHA  First will I find Lord Gondibert  What revolutions hath this  love  accomplish'd  And shall less power belong to bright  ambition  Ambition thou whose hallow'd flame can live  Only in minds refin'd from the gross elements  Of which the  herd  of human kind are made  This Deity of Fools shall yield to  thee  I'll strait to Gondibert whose

Distraction  EGBERT  When you my Lord did study in the schools  I've heard you much of Reason talk Philosophy  And Virtuenow when all their force you want  You spurn them with a blind contempt away  GONDIBERT  They have  no  force  no  pow'r beyond the schools  Where they are taught Dost think the fools who preach'em  E'er felt like me the energies of passion  Or the keen torture of an hopeless Love  EGBERT  That it  is  hopeless is a cause  GONDIBERT  For madnessCease Egbertthy chilly blood  Creeping with torpid motion through thy veins  Ill suits thee for a counsellor to me  Give me one

SisterEgbert Egbert  I could turn girl to think on what I've lost  But two short days before my Brother's marriage  I from the war return'd and the first hour  She met my ravish'd eyeswas at the altar  EGBERT  It was in truth my Lord a trying moment  GONDIBERT  Oh should the curtain'd sun in full refulgence  Dart through the shadows of the night his beams  Not more amaze would seize the minds of mortals  Than seiz'd on me when I beheld Albina  Oh my curst fortune one short week had sav'd me  For sure the ardors of my burning love  The pow'rful pleadings of my youth and form  Must soon have taught the timid beauteous Maid  That Raimond were for Gondibert well chang'd  EGBERT  Your sorrow then you virtuously o'ercame  Why should it now break out with strength renew'd  GONDIBERT  Will she not wed again  I could have borne my life without more bliss  Than the soft rights which custom gives a Brother  To see her ev'ry dayto fix my eyes  Whole hours with doating love upon her face  To feast my ears with the bewitching music  Of her sweet voiceOh 'twas a mine of happiness  EGBERT  It was a  snare  that might have plung'd you both  In irremediable woe  GONDIBERT  Impossible  For I do swear such mast'ry of my passion  Had I obtain'd to such refinement rais'd it  Angels with greater purity ne'er lov'd  No wish unhallow'd liv'd within my breast  But shall she to another yield her heart  Yield her whole self  Earth open first and swallow me Or snatch him  Oh swift perditionsnatch him from his joys  EGBERT  Oh yield not thus my Lord to your wild passions  Like calentures they will mislead your reason  With images that no where do exist  But in their own false colours  GONDIBERT  Hethis Edward  As my ill star doth ever cross my fortune  His headlong valour in the field my name  Obscur'd and in the tournament at Orleans  In th'eye of France he bore from me the crown  And now he tears away the scanty bliss  Which whilst I did possess I envy'd not  His trophies or his fame  EGBERT  Then be reveng'd  Strive to regain the fame of which he robs you  Court Glorywoo her in the fields of Death  She's the fit mistress for your rank and years  Oh shame to waste those days in languid sighs  In which your mighty Ancestors obtain'd  Their deathless namesby deeds of hardy valour  In guarding their dear Country's precious rights  GONDIBERT  Albina wed No  All arts I'll try and if they fail this arm  This arm shall drench their marriagetorch in blood  Exit  EGBERT  How do rude passions the fair mind destroy  Bestow'd by Heaven from the allperfect source  This Gondibert would once have shrunk from vice  As the chaste plant that bears no mortal touch  From infancy I've watch'd his springing virtues  Seen him beat back misfortunes when they clung  Like wary Cowards on each other's skirts  And bear with fortitude Affliction's stripes  But now unhallow'd Love the pile destroys  And Vice will triumph o'er the noble ruin  Still must I save him If one spark of virtue  Yet hovers in his mindOh grant me Heaven  To kindle it afresh and be the flame immortal  Exit  SCENE  An Apartment  Edward  and  Albina  discovered sitting on a Couch  EDWARD  rising  Blest be the

Sir  'Tis Raimond's Widow whom you thus insult  'Tis hisyour Brother's honour which you wound  With these base taunts I do believe you're false  The public voice dares not arraign my conduct  Or if it

jealousy  And every tone and look will fix it deeper  GONDIBERT  Should he be wrought to such accurst belief  Not he alone but all mankind would scorn her  The antiquated Maid the Wife the Hypocrite

soft peace and love  Yet oh it cannot be  me  she'd regard  With a cold  Sister's  brow  EDITHA  Lovers 'tis said  Have eagles' sight that can interpret glances  And the soft language of a blush explain  But eyes and blushes speak in vain to you  Or you have read them backwards  GONDIBERT  Ha what say'st thou  Lead not I charge thee to such dang'rous heights  Yet tell me  EDITHA  Tell thee Strange that Gondibert  He who can penetrate the veil of policy  Detect the sophist's arts and trace the chain  Whose hidden links controul the will of man  That he should need be  told  what not to

from disjointed converse drew his purpose  Ere morning dawns he hopes to disunite  The noble Pair  EDITHA  Sothis is then your errand  EGBERT  This is my errand to preserve their hearts  From fierce distraction's pangs when they hear things  That else might shake their faith  EDITHA  'Tis well Old Man  I will acquaint the Countess with your message  And bring you here her orders  Exit  EGBERT  Gracious Heaven  Pardon if I do break my faith to him  Whom I am bound to serve I serve him now  I drag him from a deep abyss of guilt  Which all his future days in deep remorse  And acts of virtue spent would hardly purify  Repentance calls not back the deed it mourns  And years of penitence will not rase out  The marks that sin hath graved  Enter  Editha  with Servants  EDITHA  Seize that Old Traitor  And instant in the deepest dungeon plunge him  The Countess orders this  EGBERT  Horror For me  EDITHA  For thee who falsely hast defam'd thy patron  And stain'd the honour of Lord Gondibert  Away nor listen to his prayers  EGBERT  Oh Lady  Be not so cruel to my hoary years  Egbert did never cast a stain  EDITHA  'Tis false  For thou with rude and most unseemly speech  Didst paraphrase upon the deeds of him  Whose errors should by thee be cloak'd and screen'd  From mortal eyes Why stand ye loit'ring thus  'Tis from your Mistress these commands I bring  If you obey them not 'tis at your peril  EGBERT  Oh hear me hear for the sake of him  They drag him off  EDITHA  When fools like you will prate ye must be cag'd  Lest ye should babble to the gaping world  Of things ye have not pow'rs to comprehend  To chuse that dotard for a confidant  Better have told the story at the mart  Or to the mummers who infest our halls  To be by them personify'd on eves  And holidays Of his imprisonment  His Lord must not be told Should he survive  These days of trouble he shall be releas'd  Mean time he'll learn discretion  Exit  SCENE  Another part of the Garden  Enter  Egbert  and Servants  EGBERT  Oh wonder not that I should move thus slow  Toward so sad an homeIf I might plead  SERVANT  Master fear nought thou shalt taste sleep tonight  More sweet than hersnot in a loathsome dungeon  But in repose upon thy downy couch  EGBERT  I thank thee this is kind and christianly  I fear'd you too were leagu'd for my destruction  SERVANT  Didst thou then think I had forgot the hour  In which from my poor infant eyes you wip'd  The streaming tearscherish'd my griefswoln heart  And plac'd me in Earl Raimond's family  Wherein to youth and manhood I have grown  Thou then wert my preservernow I'm thine  EGBERT  In truth surprise and terror so dismay'd me  I knew you not now that I do I bless you  SERVANT  Such orders from the Countess ne'er were given  But proud Editha's power made it unsafe  To thwart her In that grotto thou may'st bide  'Till the ev'ning grows more darkthen use this key  It leads you to the grove Farewell good Egbert  Exit  EGBERT  Farewell my Friendtomorrow better thanks  I will present theeHeav'n 'twas not thy will  That I should basely perish in my duty  Forgive me that my confidence did fail  And for a moment gave me to despair  Enter the Grotto  Enter  Gondibert  and  Editha  GONDIBERT  It is beyond my hopes 'tis a design  Which sure some pitying spirit did inspire  Who once enrob'd in flesh felt Passion's sting  And sympathetic still to human sorrows  Bestow'd the vision on thy quick'ning brain  But how requite thee for thy gen'rous aid  For me thy fame thy welfare thou dost hazard  EDITHA  To your great Brother I indebted stand  That I have now existence'Tis but just  That I should risk for  you  the welfare  he  bestow'd  GONDIBERT  But where is  he  this Edwardwho hath thrust  'Twixt me and my felicity his claim  Though now thou'rt perch'd upon the giddy wheel  And thank'st thy fate for such a glorious stand  Edward beware for I will have thee down  Though thou dost crush me in thy fall Where  is  he  EDITHA  With Raimond rioting perchance his fancy  On the bright prospect of tomorrow's blessings  GONDIBERT  Ne'er shall that morrow comeor if it doth  The coursing sun that lights them to the altar  Shall finish his diurnal round in blood  EDITHA  Try bloodless meansgive circumstance and proof  GONDIBERT  Aye stunning proof such as would shake a faith  Grav'd on the heart ere its first pulses beat  No  tale  though varnish'd with the deepest skill  No  circumstance  though guided by the hand  Of art can shade or for a moment throw  The slightest cloud on Countess Raimond's fame  But demonstrationdemonstration speaking  To his gross sense that Edward  that  shall force thee  To curse the paragon of Nature's works  And yield thee to thy raptur'd Rival's arms  EDITHA  Yet tale and circumstance will have their weight  They'll mould his mind for the  broad proof  which else  Like arrows striking 'gainst a marble rock  Will shiver or rebound I go to watch  When he retires and to direct him hither  Besure you mark each motion of his heart  Catch ev'ry passion on a barbed hook  And torture him 'till he with agony  Shall hate her  GONDIBERT  The fierce transports of his rage  May prompt him on the instant to accuse her  EDITHA  To counteract his transports be my care  This lab'ring head my Lord hath not  so  fram'd  The close design for blund'ring chance to mar  May we depend upon your servants faith  GONDIBERT  They are devoted to my will  EDITHA  Enough  The dress prepar'd you'll find within my closet  The antichamber enter at the signal  And instantly the private stairs descend  The rest kind Fortune to our wishes guide  Exit  GONDIBERT  Painful the race but Raimond is the prize  Ye Beings who superior to humanity  Behold with supercilious eye our slidings  Oh blame not me  thus  tempted if I yield  Not Man but thriftless Nature be accus'd  Who to seductions left our minds a prey  Nay more who doth herself ensnare us  Hath hung us round with senses exquisite  Hath planted in our hearts  resistless  passions  The first to weaken and the last to war  On poor defenceless naked Virtue  How dark the night The moon hath hid her head  As scorning with her lucid beams to gild  This murky business Thro' umbrageous trees  The whistling Eurus speaks in hollow murmurs  And dismal fancy in yon shadowy ailes  Might conjure up an hundred phantoms  How strong th'impression of our dawning years  The tales of sprites and goblins that did awe  My infancy all rush upon my mind  And spite of haughty reason make it shrink  Who is't approaches  Enter  Edward  EDWARD  Edward  GONDIBERT  Gondibert  EDWARD  What means this summons at so late an hour  I sought you heresent by the fair Editha  For the relation of important secrets  Which to my private ear you mean t'intrust  GONDIBERT  Could I intrust them Edward to your ear  Without the poison of the words I utter  Distilling to your heart I would with boldness  Speak them  EDWARD  Surely a tale thus guarded and hemm'd in  With words so circumspect must have much weight  But heavy matters suit not hours like these  My soul now banqueting on its felicity  And all her faculties absorb'd in bliss  Looks down from an exalted height and scorns  So low a thought as careFarewel my Lord  You'll be our guest tomorrowwelcome guest  Upon the happiest morn old Time e'er brought  To supplicating man  Going  GONDIBERT  I charge thee staythou arrogant of bliss  My tale perhaps may end in guest  forbidding  In the postponing th'hymeneal feast  EDWARD  Sayst thou postponing th'hymeneal feast  By heav'n in the wide circle of events  That possibility may teem with one  Shall not be found to make me for a day  Suspend the bliss of calling Raimond mine  GONDIBERT  Blind and presumptuous  The passing air hath borne away thy vow  And in its track thy recantation follows  Edward Albina never can be thine  Amazement sits upon thy brow I swear  That had the Countess kept her single state  My evercautious tongue had ne'er divulg'd  What it must now revealBut on the edge  Of sudden ruin Edward I behold thee  And now extend my arm to snatch thee from it  EDWARD  Thy words have form'd a chaos in my soul  Something there lurks beneath their doubtful phrase  I dread to hearyet  ask  thee to unfold  GONDIBERT  Then steel your mind to bear the story's horror  Call up your fortitude  EDWARD  Thou tortur'st mespeak it  GONDIBERT  The Widow of my Brotheris a Woman  Mere  Woman  weak  Woman of mould so tender  It can't resist a Lover's melting plea  Nor bear so harsh a charge as cruelty  EDWARD  Do I not know that she is tender soft  As dreams of cradled infancy or note  Of Philomelwhose music in the ear  Of the benighted traveller makes beams  Of roseate morn unwelcome to his eye  Why then to me mysteriously descant  Upon her gentleness  GONDIBERT  'Cause more than thee  Her gentleness with healing pity views  And to benighted  Lovers  makes the beams  Of roseate morn unwelcome  EDWARD  Villain thou liest  Drawing  GONDIBERT  Come come this female rage ill suits a soldier  EDWARD  Ill suits thy blasphemy base Coward  GONDIBERT  Coward  Edward thou darest not  shalt  not think me Coward  EDWARD  Then guard thee or I'll write it in thy heart  GONDIBERT  Hah come on then plunge in thy weapon deep  Besure take heed thou dost not miss the spot  Where illjudg'd friendship in that heart for Edward  Tranform'd him into Gondibert's assassin  EDWARD  Oh  GONDIBERT  Shrink not appease your anger with my blood  Then to Albina boast of having slain  The man who had unveil'd her to your eyes  She'll fawn upon theecozen theeand gull thee  With the fond vows that have in  other  ears  Shed their sweet poison  EDWARD  Should my Father's spirit  From heav'n descend t'abet thee in this tale  I'd swear it ly'd  GONDIBERT  Nay then I crave your pardon  Think it rank salfehoodphantom of my brain  Raimond was guil'd when he believ'd her naught  Goodnight my Lord  Going  EDWARD  Hold O stay Gondibert  Why what a frame is mine to shake thus  Raimond  Didst say  GONDIBERT  YesRaimond But I see too well  You can't support it Prithee ask no more  EDWARD  Nay but I  will  ask though each word you utter  Steals like a chilly poison through my veins  And binds my blood in frost Say did your Brother  Oh answeranswer meI cannot speak it  GONDIBERT  He did my Brother oft hath call'd herwanton  And in the anguish of his soul hath curs'd her  The Roman Julia he would say to her  Was chaste whose loose desires  EDWARD  Now thou  dost  lye  By Heaven such purity was never dress'd  In frail mortality Her govern'd passions  Are the soft zephyrs of a vernal morn  That breathe their perfume on the blushing rose  GONDIBERT  The zephyrs of a vernal morn may swell  To hurricanesSuch undiscerning tumults  Her  passions knowThis piece of pure mortality  EDWARD  Draw villain  Or I will plunge my dagger in thy throat  And bear thy lying tongue upon its point  Enter  Editha  EDITHA  What horrid noise breaks through the sober night  Shield meA naked sword  GONDIBERT  You'll not fight  Before a Lady SirI'th'morning meet me  Meet me before the hour the Priest expects thee  That at the altar when thou'lt eager join  Thy chiding Bride thou may'st atonement make  And with the marriagering present the heart  His bleeding heart who with ungentle truths  To rob her of her Husbandvainly strove  Exit  EDWARD  Perdition catch thy breath  Knew you Editha when you sent me hither  The purport of that villain's tale  EDITHA  Your looks  Affright me so my Lord Pray sheathe your dagger  Fain fain would I escape this dreadful task  My duty to the Countess binds my tongue  Excuse me then my Lord  EDWARD  I charge thee speak  By all the friendship which I bear to thee  By thy own high regard to truth and honour  I charge thee spare me nottell all tell all  EDITHA  Then I confess me privy to the counsel  Which Gondibert to you design'd to offer  And for your honour 'twere that you should  heed  it  EDWARD  Again thou bring'st me back to all my horror  Dost  thou  say this Editha thou who know'st  Each secret winding of her heart  EDITHA  I do  And what I've said I'll back with proof  EDWARD  What proof  EDITHA  That if you wed her you will be undone  That you will only share Albina's love  Unfair she deems it having sov'reign beauty  To scant its blessings to a  single  object  Like the universal sun she sheds her glories  Beaming impartially on all mankind  EDWARD  Vile slanderer yet hold There have been women  Whose bosoms with licentious hell have burn'd  But these were monstrous and of actions horrible  These did not wear the hallow'd looks of virtue  The soul of chasteness breath'd not in their words  Were Raimond then like those  EDITHA  Hah my good Lord  You know not our deceitful dang'rous sex  Those minds imbued by vice with deepest stains  Are often mask'd in forms almost divine  Deck'd forth in words and looks that Virtue's self  Might challenge for her own Such is Albina  Such did Albina to her Lord appear  What cause save that sent him to Palestine  Why went he there for honourable death  But that  her  faults did surfeit him of life  EDWARD  If this is truth oh Truth be thou accurst  Falsehood's from HeavenDeceit wrap me again  In thick impervious folds Thou busy wretch  Why rouse me from a lethargy of bliss  Yet I'll have  truth  if thou hast proof present it  If not fly swifter than the lightning's fork  Lest like the lightning I transfix thee Oh no  Swear thou art false I'll twist thee round my heartstrings  EDITHA  I will abide the proof Know that a youth  Of birth obscurein mien a bright Adonis  Hath long possess'd Albina's secret hours  That these last hours she will devote to him  And in her chamber you shall see him lodg'd  When she retires to rest  EDWARD  Nay now thou weigh'st me down Oh oh  EDITHA  If it o'ercomes you thus my Lord go home  EDWARD  Home I'll go howl in deserts with the wolves  Forsake society curse human kind  But chiefly woman  EDITHA  Nay come with me my Lord  I'll lead you to the hall where you'll observe  The doings of our house  EDWARD  Thou art a fiend  And tempting me to hell  EDITHA  Nay then  EDWARD  Oh parden me  Conduct me to my woe  Exeunt  Enter  Egbert  EGBERT  Go senseless lamb  And meet the sanguine knife Oh merciful  And is't a  Woman  I have seeh Woman  On whom thou hast bestow'd Nature's best feelings  With nerves of finest tone to catch each woe  And strike it on the heart Oh I'm asham'd  That I stand kindred in creation's scale  With such a being Haply am I witness  To the base league Now in the toils Editha  Which thou didst spread for me thyself art fallen  Thus Heaven doth punish with our own acts  And makes our crimes our woe  SCENE  A Hall with a Staircase and Gallery  Enter  Edward  and  Editha  from the Garden  EDITHA  Stand here my Lord The hour is now arriv'd  In which the Countess usually retires  Yet oh be patient and I

past afflictions  Forget them now and may sweet sleep attend you  Albina  ascends the Stairs and enters her Apartment  EDWARD  There's the rich temple that conceals my Love  If  she  be naught Nature's in league with Vice  And pour'd on Raimond such a waste of charms  To draw from sainted Virtue her disciples  Attendants leave the Apartment  Silence prevails  Oh on this spot I will with patience count  The lagging moments of the night to triumph  In the sure failure of their promis'd proof  Hahhark methought there was a noise Alas  The clicking deathwatch or the passing air  Hath now a sound to freeze me  A Pause  Gondibert  enters at one End of the Gallery and goes into the Chamber  Hah stay villain stay  Editha  enters and flings herself before the Stairs  EDITHA  Ah cease cease

My Liege  I  answer the demand Lord Edward  Did yesterday with humble suit entreat  That in his favour I would move my Daughter  Feigning true passion and unequall'd love  With warm regard I did

Submission to your laws Its faithful point  Hath prob'd the hearts of Infidels and Rebels  May its good service to confusion turn  And may this arm cling nerveless to my side  If I depart the lists
