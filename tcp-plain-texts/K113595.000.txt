 THE HAUNCH OF VENISON A POETICAL EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  Entered at Stationers Hall  portrait of Oliver Goldsmith  THE HAUNCH OF VENISON A POETICAL EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE  By the late Dr GOLDSMITH  With a HEAD of the AUTHOR Drawn by HENRY BUNBURY  Esq  and Etched by BRETHERTON  LONDON Printed for J RIDLEY in St James's Street and G KEARSLY in Fleet Street MDCCLXXVI  TO Lord  CLARE  THANKS my Lord for your Ven'son for finer or fatter  Never rang'd in a forest or smok'd on a platter  The Haunch was a picture for Painters to study  The white was so white and the red was so ruddy  I had thoughts in my chamber to hang it in view  To be shown to my Friends as a piece of  Virt√π  As in some  Irish  Houses where things are soso  One Gammon of Bacon hangs up for a show  But for eating a rasher of what they take pride in  They'd as soon think of eating the pan it is fry'd in  But holdlet us pauseDon't I hear you pronounce  This tale of the Bacon a damnable bounce  Well suppose it a bounce sure a Poet may try  By a bounce now and then to get courage to fly  But my Lord it's no bounce I protest in my turn  It's a truth and your Lordship may ask Mr BURNE  To go on with my taleAs I gaz'd on the Haunch  thought of a Friend that was trusty and staunch  So I cut it and sent it to REYNOLDS undrest  To paint it or eat it just as he lik'd best  Of the Neck and the Breast I had next to dispose  'Twas a neck and a breastthat might rival MONROE's  But in parting with these I was puzzled again  With the  how  and the  who  and the  where  and the  when  There's COLEY and WILLIAMS and HOWARD and HIFF  I think they love Ven'son I know they love Beef  Buthang itto Poets that seldom can eat  Your very good Mutton's a very good treat  Such dainties to them It  would  look like a flirt  Like sending 'em Ruffles when wanting a Shirt  While thus I debated in  reverie  center'd  An Acquaintance a Friendas he call'd himself enter'd  A finespoken Customhouse Officer he  Who smil'd as he gaz'd on the Ven'son and me  " What have we got hereAye this is  good eating  " Your own I supposeor is it in waiting"  Why whose should it be Sir  cry'd I with a flounce  I get these things often  But that was a bounce  " If that be the case then" cry'd he very gay  " I'm glad I have taken this house in my way  " Tomorrow you take a poor dinner with me  " No wordsI insist on'tprecisely at three  " And now that I think on't as I am a sinner  " We wanted this Ven'son to make up the dinner  " I'll take no denialyou shall and you must  " And my Wife little  Kitty  is famous for Crust  " We'll have JOHNSON and BURKE all the Wits will be there  " My acquaintance is slight or I'd ask my Lord CLARE  " Here Porter this Ven'son with me to  Mileend  " No words my dear GOLDSMITH my very good Friend"  Thus seizing his hat he brush'd off like the wind  And the Porter and Eatables follow'd behind  Left alone to reflect having empty'd my shelf  And nobody with me at sea but myself  Though I could not help thinking my Gentleman hasty  Yet JOHNSON and BURKE and a good Ven'son Pasty  Were things that I never dislik'd in my life  Though clogg'd with a Coxcomb and  Kitty  his Wife  So next day in due splendor to make my approach  I drove to his door in my own Hackneycoach  When come to the place where we all were to dine  A chairlumber'd Closet just twelve feet by nine  My Friend bid me welcome but struck me quite dumb  With tidings  that  JOHNSON and BURKE could not come  " And I knew it" he cry'd "both eternally fail  " The one at the House and the other with THRALE  " But I warrant for me we shall make up the Party  " With two full as clever and ten times as hearty  " The one is a  Scotchman  the other a  Jew  " Who dabble and write in the Paperslike you  " The one writes the  Snarler  the other the  Scourge  " Some think he writes  Cinna  he owns to  Panurge  "  While thus he describ'd them by Trade and by Name  They enter'd and Dinner was serv'd as they came  At the top a fry'd Liver and Bacon was seen  At the bottom was Tripe in a swinging terrene  At the sides there was Spinage and Pudding made hot  In the middlea place where the Ven'son was not  Now my Lord as for Tripe it's my utter aversion  And your Bacon I hate like a  Turk  or a  Persian  But what vex'd me most was that damn'd  Scottish  Rogue  With his longwinded speeches and smiles and his brogue  " And Madam" says he "may this bit be my poison  " If a prettier Dinner I ever set eyes on  " Pray a slice of your Liverbut may I be curst  " But I've eat of your Tripe till I'm ready to burst"  'Your Tripe' quoth the  Jew  'if the truth I may speak  'I could eat of this Tripe seven days in the week  'I like these  here  Dinners so pretty and small  'But your Friend there the Doctor eats nothing at all'  " O ho" quoth my Friend "he'll come on in a trice  " He's keeping a corner for something that's nice  " There's a Pasty"'A Pasty' returned the  Scot  'I don't care if I keep a corner for  thot  '  " We'll all keep a corner" the Lady cry'd out  We'll all keep a corner  was eccho'd about  While thus we resolv'd and the Pasty delay'd  With looks quite astonishing enter'd the Maid  A visage so sad and so pale with affright  Wak'd PRIAM by drawing his curtains by night  But too soon we found out for who could mistake her  That she came with some terrible news from the Baker  And so it fell out for that negligent Sloven  Had shut out the Pasty on shutting his Oven  Sad  Philomel  thusbut let similes drop  And now that I think on't the story may stop  To be plain my good Lord 'tis but labour misplac'd  To send such good Verses to one of your taste  You've got an odd something a kind of discerning  A relish a taste sicken'd over by learning  At least it's your temper 'tis very well known  That you think very slightly of all that's your own  So perhaps in your habits of thinking amiss  You may make a Mistakeand think slightly of This  THE END  EPITAPH  THIS tomb inscrib'd to gentle PARNEL's name  May speak our gratitude but not his fame  What heart but feels his sweetlymoral lay  That leads to Truth thro' Pleasure's flow'ry way  Celestial themes confess'd his tuneful aid  And Heav'n that lent him Genius was repaid  Needless to him the tribute we bestow  The transitory breath of Fame below  More lasting rapture from his Works shall rise  While Converts thank their Poet in the skies  FROM THE Oratorio of the CAPTIVITY BY Dr  GOLDSMITH  SONG  THE Wretch condemn'd with life to part  Still still on Hope relies  And ev'ry pang that rends the heart  Bids Expectation rise  Hope like the glim'ring taper's light  Adorns and chears the way  And still as darker grows the night  Emits a brighter ray  SONG  I  O Memory thou fond deceiver  Still importunate and vain  To former joys recurring ever  And turning all the past to pain  II  Thou like the world th' opprest oppressing  Thy smiles increase the wretch's woe  And he who wants each other blessing  In thee must ever find a foe
